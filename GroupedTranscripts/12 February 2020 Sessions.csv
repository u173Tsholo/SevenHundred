CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody.    We have to make progress today.    We just have to make progress today.  Okay.  Ms Memela you are still under oath let us get going.    Yes.    Yes no that is fine.  Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Ms Mbanjwa did you – do you see that?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Okay alright.    Thank you.  Well I just say that it should take quite something before one colleague accuses another of deliberately doing something wrong.  Sometimes it is oversight but one would expect that when one says deliberately one has double checked.  But the issue has been sorted out, you have apologised, you have withdrawn.  That is the end of the matter.      Yes.  Yes no that is fine.  Thank you.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja 3183 – 3183.    I have lost you or you have lost me.    The problem is that with these emails sometimes you have got to go     Forward     Sometimes you have to go back.    Okay.    Oh okay.    Well I was still at 3182.    Okay.    Ja.    Please keep to your promise.    Yes.  You say yes I accept or no I do not accept and [indistinct].    Ja okay.    Ja but she just wanted your own.    Understanding.    Ja.    The draw down.    Yes okay.    I do not propose to go there.    But when you read it I will – ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    No she is not saying that.    She is says – she says if there is a letter of credit.    Ja but she says the way it is going to work is that AAR will not have access to that.    Unless there is a late payment.    If there is no late payment.    Ja.    Okay.    Whereas if you give them cash you have given them cash before there is any need.    Ja.    Ms Hofmeyr.    Is that right?    Okay alright.    Ja.    Yes.    Ys.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Okay.  Ms Mbanjwa you have your hand up.  I just want to say that today you will have to have very good reasons for objections.  I want us to get going.    No how do you know what Ms Hofmeyr – what knowledge Ms Hofmeyr has and what...    Knowledge she does not have.    How do you know that Ms Mbanjwa?    No Ms Mbanjwa no.    No, no, no.  Ms Hofmeyr is asking Ms Memela to give her own understanding.  She does not have to be an expert.  She does not need to be a financial person to give her own understanding.  She is not being asked to give expert evidence.  She can say as far as I know this is what happens.  Or my understanding is the following.  It might be correct, it might not be correct but it is my understanding.      She will say I do not know.    And then we will move on.    She has been giving her understanding.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    But if it is not she will say, I do not know and that is acceptable.    Okay let us get going.    Yes should – yes should be enough.    Ja but wait for the next question.    Ja.  Yes is a good enough answer    Yes.    Yes.    The answer will be yes I did or no I did not.    Ja.    Okay.    Hang on a second.    Ms Memela do you need some – a few minutes?    Are you okay?    No if you do need time to take medication or anything.    Just let me know.    Okay, alright.    I did notice.  I am watching.    Okay alright.    She just wants to confirm that you agree that you said that is a critical criteria.    No.  Okay Chair I have just explained again.    Well I must say that after you explained.    I was not sure either.    Ja.  Ja.  But if you say yes it was a critical requirement that will be – if it was or no it was not.    Yes.    Okay what was under Phase 1?    Ja.    Okay.  Hang on.      Hang on.  Just say – just say to Ms Hofmeyr yes it was a critical requirement or no it was not a critical requirement?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    You …    You accept it was?    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    From CFST?    Ja.    Is your answer that you do not remember whether you paid particular attention?    Okay.  So you do not remember whether you paid particular attention to - to it?    Okay.    Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr.    Yes.    Ja.  Read it.    Yes.    But you say there - there is no timeframe specified timeframe within which …    Such a proposal was required to be submitted to be submitted?    Yes.  Ja.    Yes.    No, no, no.    No, no, no.  I think - I think you have given the answer.    Let us see what Ms Hofmeyr …    Has to say.  You said there is no timeframe within which …    They were required to do so.  Okay.    Well you see …    Yes.    Ja.  What - what she is - what Ms Hofmeyr is doing is questioning your - your answer.  You say there was no timeframe within which they were required to put in a proposal.  So she is saying, but this was part of the request …    For bids …    And therefore it - it must be that that information is supposed to be there when the bid is put in.  That - that is what she is suggesting …    And what is your answer to that?    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Ms Hofmeyr.    Yes.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    (Intervenes).    Yes.    What - what I would have expected and I suspect it might be the same expectation that Ms Hofmeyr would have …    In the context of tenders.  Is that when the request for bids says Supplier Development is a critical requirement and says what is written here should be 10 percent of the value of the contract and so on.    I would have expected that what is being required is that if you want to bid for this tender.    One of the things that must be dealt with in your proposal is - in your bid is - is the Supplier Development and that one of the things that you will be competing with other bidders on is how good is what you are putting on the table in terms of Supplier Development.  So if your - your - if what you say on supply - Supplier Development is vague and so on and somebody else …    Has got a very clear picture of what they are going to do.  You stand a better chance of - of getting more - more points than the other one who has got just vague statements.    As to how they will contribute.    That is what I would expect.    What do you say?    But you see that the bidder needs to address exactly that.  The - well the bidder needs to say the people who will adjudicate this bid.  What will they be needing in order for me to give me maximum points?   They will be needing to know whether I already have a local supplier that I will work with.    They will need to know whether I have had discussions with this local supplier about what this local suppliers needs …    And I have evaluated their suggestions of where I can help …    And I have made up my mind that this is where I will help.  So when I put in my bid.  I am clear about that and I - if I - if necessary I attach a letter from the local supplier that says indeed these are the things that we need desperately.    So you make your bid as a bidder …    Full and complete on this issue.    But …    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Is my understanding correct that your evidence is therefore to the effect that at the time when the proposal is - the bid is put in.    There is not much information.  You as SAAT were expecting the bidders to put in …    Under Supplier Development.    All you needed is a commitment …    That they will - what would be the commitment you j- you would need?  What - what would you say?    It will be a commitment that says what?    Is it a commitment to - to put aside 10 percent of the value to supply - to Supplier Development …    Generally or is it much more detailed than that?    But you see I will - I will let Ms Hofmeyr continue - continue now.  You see my - my understanding …    Would - would be that you need to put in your bid how good …    Your proposal is on how you will contribute to Supplier Development.  You might say to me …    Maybe that is how - that is the impression what is written here gives, but at a practical level we at SAAT accepted that - accepted proposals or bids that did not have much.  As long as it was clear that the company or the bidder was committing to contributing the  percent …    Required.  That - that would be enough at the stage of putting in the bid.  The rest would be discussed when they have won.    Yes.    Hm.  CFST.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    So …    So is my understanding correct that what you are saying is that the way that SAAT applied this or the CS …    CFST applied this was that they would only discuss with the bidder after the bidder has won?    Has won, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Would that be done before the actual contract is signed or would it be done after the contract has been signed?    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Okay.  Alright.    Well I - I can tell you, but we will - Ms Hofmeyr may have questions.  I can tell you it seems to me much more sensible to say put your proposal …    And deal with Supplier Development fully …    But I understand … (intervenes)     Understand.    No, no, no.  You - you …    No, no, no.  No.  You are saying …    What you understood to be happening and why it was happening.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    No.  That is fine.    That is fine.    That is fine.    Ms Hofmeyr.    Well no, no.    No, no.  I am going to stop you Ms …    Ms Memela, I am going to stop you.  You see you may not have sat in CFST Meetings, but you were the Head of Procurement and therefore one would expect that you would know how procurement processes were dealt with …    And one would expect that you would know for example what this kind of requirement - how it was applied or it was adjudicated, because as Head of Procurement you would be expected - I - I would imagine - to guide quite a lot of people within SAAT to say on procurement issues …    This is what - this is what we - we require as SAAT and these are our policies.  This is legislation.  If there is this requirement which is said to be critical one would expect that you would know how it is supposed to deal with - to be dealt with.  So that if …    For example CS - CFST did not deal with it the way it should be dealt with.    I would expect that you would be the person to say you people are not acting in compliance with this requirement the way you deal with your - with your work.    That is my expectation.    Yes.    Okay.  Comment on what I have just said.    But remember …    That is fine …    But I want you to focus on - on commenting whether my expectation …    My expectation …    Of what …    Would be expected from you.    As HOD of Procurement whether it is correct.    No.  Start by saying yes I agree …    That would be expected from me as HOD or no.  I - I do not agree.  That would not be expected.  Then if you need to give an example then - then I can follow.  Let us clear that part first.    Is - is to know what the - the requirements are for proper procurement processes at SAAT and if there is a critical requirement such as this you would be expected to know what it is, number one.  You would be expected to know how it is adjudicated.    So that if CFST for example did not apply it the way it should be applied.  You would be able to say no, no, no.  CS - CFST you are not applying this the way it should be applied.  That is my expectation.    That expectation maybe wrong, because maybe that is not what your job description was, but that would be what I would expect from Head of Procurement.  Is my expectation correct or not?    You can tell me it is incorrect.    You can tell me it is incorrect …    Because - because I do not know the policies.  Yes.    Ja.    Hm.  Okay.    Okay.  Okay.    Okay.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Let us continue.     Probably I don’t need to go there?     Yes.     Well read it, maybe once you have read it Ms Memela might not need to look at it, but if you need to look at it please, is the file there that has got it?     No, no I was talking for myself, but if you do need to look at it it is fine but she will read it.      Ms Mbanjwa?     Ms Mbanjwa this line of questioning is legitimate, please sit down.     Yes now do you know as a fact that in – during those years, you talked about from 2008.     Do you know for a fact that ...[intervenes]      ...the position was that Air France maybe had given a positive undertaken or commitment but failed to do what they had promised to do that would have either fallen under NIP obligation or supply development or is the position that they had even refused to commit themselves, do you know what the position is?     Mmm.     But remember ...[intervenes]      Yes answer the question, ja.     The contract that they were having in 20 – was it 16/2017?     The contract is that the one that happened running form 2008?     And they tendered for this one ...[intervenes]      ...as well, and now the supplier development requirement began in – is it 2013?     Around 2013.     Yes, before that.     For longer.     Okay.     Do you recall having given that evidence.     If you don’t recall you may have you may not.     The reason why she is starting by  asking you is that she doesn’t want to put you a question and then you have a fight about whether you said that, so she wants to clear that, clear that out of the way that you remember that that was your evidence.   You don’t remember or you do remember?     I seem to remember that you said so as well, that’s my recollection.     No, no yesterday and the day before.     Ja, well you might have repeated it now.     In respect of other contracts.      Yes Ms Memela?     Okay, let me put it ...[intervenes]      Let me put it to you this way.  Let me put it this way.   You gave evidence this morning in regard to the supplier development requirement that all that was required of a bidder under supplier development is to indicate yes, which would be a commitment on their part to doing what is expected under supplier development.         You said it was not required of a bidder at the time of submitting their bid to give any details really, as long as it said yes.     So Ms Hofmeyr is saying to you when the Board had to consider whether to go along with the recommendation of the CEO that Air France should be the one awarded and they decided that no that should not happen it should be AAR their reason insofar as they said it is on Supply Development ...[intervenes]      ...could not be legitimate because the answers that were given by both Air France and AAR were exactly the same in regard to supplier development.  She says if the answers are the exactly the same and a bidder is not required to give any details just the answer yes is good enough, then it must be good enough for each one of them, so she is saying then this reason advanced by the Board does not make sense.  What do you say?     Hang on, hang on, she said one of the reasons given was supply development, Ms Hofmeyr”?     Are you saying that is not true, it was not one of the reasons?     No but what I want you to start by saying is whether you say it is not true that that is one of the reasons the Board gave or you say it is true but I have this to add?     Let us start the way I am saying, was it one of the reasons, then you can add if you want to add.     It was a reason for what?  It was given as a reason for what?     No, no let us not go there, the question is not about that.   The question is well one, you have said that it was one of the reasons, so my question is it was one of the reasons for what, because Ms Hofmeyr says it was one of the reasons given by  the Board for rejecting the CEO’s recommendation that Air France should be given.     Let us not go to the statement, let us go to the one that I am saying.       Ms Hofmeyr says the Board, one of the reasons given by the Board why they did not accept the CEO’s proposal or recommendation that Air France should be awarded was supply development.     You say it was one of the reasons but not for rejecting, so I am asking the question what was it given as a reason for then?     Okay Ms Memela we are going to move on, you just said earlier on it was a reason, but not for the rejection of the CEO’s recommendation.     Yes, okay, alright.   Let’s move on.     Yes, I just noticed too.     Yes.     Well we can ...[intervenes]      Or take it at half past but if it is convenient to take it now we can take it now.     Okay let’s take the tea adjournment, we will resume – it is twenty past now, we will resume at twenty five to twelve. We adjourn.     Okay let us get going.     Ja, he was based on documentation.       He made the point that he had no personal knowledge of a lot of things ...[intervenes].      But he had looked at records and [intervenes].     And mostly he was giving evidence based on records.     I think Miss Mbanjwa wants the page number.     Yes, Miss Mbanjwa?     That - that Miss Mbanjwa you can use in your re-examination or in argument.     Well let’s start – let’s start ...[intervenes].      I am sorry.     Let us start first by confirming that you know Mr Chadi because he says he has been there since 2011.     And you know him as Compliance Officer or whatever the position.     Yes.     I think she may ...[intervenes].      Have taken that from the affidavit.     Yes okay.     Yes.  Yes – yes okay, and the question was whether you dispute what he says there?     Applies ja.     That you accept?     Oh, you say you dispute that?     Okay.     Am I right to say you say the reason why  you dispute what he says is because as far as you know there is nothing in writing that confirms that.     Okay, yes, alright.  Miss Hofmeyr?     Yes.     So, you are saying in the absence of a resolution by the board of SAAT saying we are adopting this policy and in the absence of something in the policy itself, saying that if SAAT does not have its own policy this policy will apply.  You say in the absence of those two things, you dispute his evidence.      Okay.     No, no, one-by-one is much more convenient.  Because if you have to respond to nine can you imagine?     No, it is much more convenient if she takes one-by-one and then you respond then it is clear what is being put to you.     It is clear what your answer is and then she moves to the next one.      And it will move quite quicker with crisp answers.     No – no - no that is fine.  But remember I want crisp answers but if you feel strongly that you need to explain something, I will keep an eye on that.       And you can say that is not true.  I did take it into account or it is not true or it is true I did not take it into account and then if you need to explain it [intervenes].     That is not true?     Okay.     No well, she says is that correct, and your answer should start with yes it is correct or no it is not correct.      Then you can explain if you need to explain.     So, you will not say whether you supported or did not support [intervenes].     But you have made your comment.     Okay.     Okay.     Ja I remember you testified about penalties.     Miss Mbanjwa has it fallen away?     You wanted the respects in which it was detrimental?     Okay.     Oh, okay.     Oh yes.  Okay.     Okay.     Well the, what Miss Hofmeyr is continuing to do is to specify the respects. [Intervenes].     in which the contract was prejudicial to SAAT.     Yes, yes.  You have talked about penalties, but do you accept that the absence of such a penalty in favour of SAAT was prejudicial to SAAT.     Yes, okay.     Okay.     Prejudicial     If – if - if Miss Mbheki did not get what she wanted for SAAT you say yes.     Oh.     I am sorry Miss Memela?     No, she is going back she had to pause at nine [Intervenes].     Deal with the - and give you the respects in which she says the contract [Intervenes].     The contract was prejudicial to SAAT [intervenes].     Now she is going back to [intervenes].      Might be the fourth [intervenes].     Or the fifth.     Somebody will bring you water.     Will somebody bring her water please?     Oh, okay.  Okay.     Do you want the question to be repeated?    At the time when you occupied the position that she was occupying.    Mm.    But we do not- we might not need to go there- that far.    Your answer is ... (intervenes)    As HOD SCM ... (intervenes)    That was not part of your responsibility.    Ja, it had been part when you were occupying another position.    Okay.    She says do you remember.    Ja.    Ja.  Then she will come ... (intervenes)    With a question if there is a question.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well is your- is the position that Ms Mbeki was the one responsible for managing contracts?    But she was reporting to you.    I take it that that what- that the effect of that is that your portfolio, your department, your unit.    Was responsible for contract management.  Who within the unit, who within the department internally was given that responsibility is something else but your unit, your department was responsible for managing contracts?  Is my understanding correct?    No, you see you were the Head of the Department.    You have to take responsibility for the performance of duties of those who report to you.  Is it not?  If something goes wrong within your department the CEO is entitled to call you and not Ms Mbeki and say, why are your subordinate not doing their job?    Is it not?    So, from that point of view is it not correct that it would be correct to say you were in charge of the department that was responsible for contract management.    Yes.    Okay.    Let me make sure I understand what you are talking about.  Remember yesterday we talked a lot about the deposit?    And I thought that when we had that discussion ultimately you accepted, I thought and you must tell me if I misunderstood.  I thought you accepted that where the contract required payment of a deposit it required nothing more than the provision of that credit letter or letter of credit guaranteed by bank acceptable to AAR.  Did I understand you correctly that you accepted that that is what payment of deposit meant, the provision of that letter?    Hofmeyr.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Now just to clarify because I was not sure at some stage yesterday if I understood what you are talking about.  Other than the payment of a deposit has contemplated in the clause that we read yesterday that talked about the letter of credit.    Other than the payment of deposit.    Provided for there.  Was there any payment of cash that the contract required to be made by SAAT before anything- before the contract could- before performance by AAR?    There was no.    Okay alright.    It is just that there was reference to security at some stage ... (intervenes)    I do not know whether it was security deposit and I was not sure whether ... (intervenes)    The agreement whether that was another type of deposit or it was the same deposit.    Oh okay.  No that is fine.  So, your evidence is you accept that in terms of the contract there was no advance payment of cash that was required from SAAT?    In terms of the clause.    Alright.    Okay ja.    The question was just factual in terms of time.    You accept that it was after in terms of time.    Ja.    What Ms Hofmeyr is putting to you is that because JM Aviation had made a payment ... (intervenes)    Ja, had made this payment.    This had the result that you overlooked things in the performance of your work that you should not have overlooked and SAAT was prejudiced.  Ms Hofmeyr is that correct?    Yes.      That is what she is putting.    Ja.  No, no, you can explain now.    You can explain now.    That is Mr Human.    Yes.  Yes okay.  Thank you.    We are at 12   We will determine the date and if Ms Mbanjwa has any problem she will make representations but we will determine dates.  Because we know if you say you will agree dates with practitioners, you never get anywhere so.    So, we will- another date will be arranged when Ms Memela will come back and then Ms Mbanjwa will get a chance to re-examine.  So, I think that that is what we will do.  We will have to stop here.    Ms Mbanjwa, you understand?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay she- you have raised the issue with her.    And she hears you.    Okay, thank you.    Ms Memela, you understand what I said that we will adjourn ... (intervenes)    And then arrangements will be made and you will come back.    Okay alright.  Thank you very much to everybody.  We    Ja and we continue with the aviation witnesses.    Ja.  Okay alright.  So, we will adjourn for the day.  Tomorrow we are not going to be sitting and Friday.  But we will resume on Monday.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair.    Yes we are indeed Chair.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Chair during the hearing yesterday afternoon Ms Mbanjwa interjected at a point to raise a concern that I had deliberately failed to read out to Ms Memela an exculpatory part of Ms Mbeki’s affidavit.  And you will recall that I responded at the time to say that the transcript would show.    That contrary to Ms Mbanjwa’s accusation I had in fact read out the final sentence of that part of Ms Mbeki’s affidavit.  Chair the accusation is not only one that impugns my integrity as an evidence leader in this commission but it also casts a shadow on the processes of the commission.  Because the nub of the accusation is that there are evidence leaders in this commission who deliberately fail to put relevant exculpatory parts of the facts available to it to a witness who is being questioned.  And it is for that reason that I address it this morning Chair.  Chair you have said many times before in these proceedings that the evidence leaders of this commission are not here to prove a case.  That it is our role to enable the commission to conduct its fact finding mission.  Chair the commission has many tools available to it to do that.  It has compulsion powers.  It can summons documents and witnesses and testify before it.  It has an extensive investigative arm that tirelessly pursues lines of investigation and analysis teams. Chair evidence leaders in this commission have a single tool with which to do their work and that is in the questions that we put to witnesses.  Chair those questions I submit must be designed to uncover the truth and as a result the questioning will at time be robust.  It will involve taking witnesses to documents when documents do not bear out the evidence that they are giving.  It will involve pointing out contradictions in a witness’ testimony.  And it will also involve taking witnesses to the versions of other persons where those versions are distinct or contradict the version of the witness.  Sometimes those versions will be uncomfortable but they must be put when they are directly at odds with what the witness is saying in the testimony.  But the one thing Chair that an evidence leader should never do in their questioning is deliberately fail to put relevant exculpatory information evidence to a witness that they are questioning.  It is – that was the charge that was made against me yesterday.  It was serious and Chair it was patently false.  And I say that because I am going to now hand up the copies of the transcript of yesterday.  I will make available copies to my learned friends – I – Chair I am not paginating them they are the transcripts.    And I will just direct you to the relevant parts.  Chair the excerpt from the transcript begins at page 161 of 217 pages.  You can see that it was a long day on the basis of the total number of pages.      But where we pick it up is at line 10 because that is where I begin to quote from Ms Mbeki’s affidavit.  And at that point I was reading into the record and for Ms Memela’s benefit what Ms Mbeki had said at paragraph 25 of her affidavit.  You will see the transcript includes that entire paragraph that I read in and then if you go over the page to page 162 you will see at line 9 at page 162 I read in the very sentence that I was accused of deliberately having failed to read in.  That sentence was the sentence where Ms Mbeki in her    Thank you Chair.    Ms Memela we concluded yesterday’s evidence when we were looking at the cash position of SAAT at the time that they were being asked to make this payment of the 4.1 million US Dollars to AAR.  And we were at that point in Exhibit DD22G.  And the relevant page is 3188.      3188.    Thank you.  So just before we got to the cash position yesterday we had been looking at certain correspondence in April of 2017 just to orientate you and that was where after a flow of emails you wrote back to the SAAT team to indicate to them that according to the contract those were the opening words of your first paragraph of your email SAAT was required to pay this deposit and then you went into explaining how there had been negotiations around staggering that payment.  It did not have to be all three months at once.  There would be one month and then follow ups.  But what the emails in May indicate is that that had still not been adequately addressed by May.  And so there were follow ups – follows up from AAR and where I would like to pick it up is at page 3188.  There is an email there sort of third of the way down from yourself to Ms Mosese, Mr Eria    And then if you go back a page.  Actually it is two because this is a strange way in which the flow has been placed in the bundle but the next follow up is at 3183.    If you go all the way back to 3183.  There is some interchange around emails from AAR talking about them – year end and the need for them to have the payment before that.    And then at the top of page 3183 you will see Mr Eria writes to you.    3183    You will see Mr Eria there at the top of the page on the 4 May 2017.    Says the following to you. “Hi Nontsasa we are committed to pay the 431 May 17 both BPTH and the second third of the deposit.  However I cannot say how the group cash position would be at that time.  By end May 2017 we would have paid”    And then that is then followed up at 3181.    3182 yes would you like to – oh yes because you then forward it to Mr Price and you – that is an AAR person, is that right?    And you say   And then Mr Eria responds on the 5 May to    No it is because I am going so fast.    Back.    I know.    Chair and you know as I was doing it I was realising it was too fast but it is my effort to move swiftly today.    Chair we are now at 3181.    That is where I might have lost you.    Yes indeed.  So let us just recap.    Because I was going too fast.     At 3182 Ms Memela has forwarded the response from Mr Eria to the AAR representative because now the issue is when are they going to be able to get the payment through.  And the AAR representative thanks Ms Memela for forwarding it and they explain why they need the payment early because of their financial year end.    And then at page 3181 Ms Memela sends an    And do you accept that at the time that SAAT was required to make this payment it had an impact on the cash position of SAAT?    Yes.    Do you accept that it did?    And why is that?    Do you understand how the draw down was going to work if all that had been provided was a guarantee?    How the draw down would have worked?    Let me explain it from the provisions of Clause 4.26 of the contract.  You will recall that when we looked at it yesterday Clause – I understand we need to go to Clause 4.26.    No.  It is in DD22F.    You are happy oh good.    Certainly.  So all I am going to do is paraphrase the clause but in anyone wants to be looking at it at the same time it is in DD22F at page 2325.  So what the clause provided for was payment of the deposit by way of an irrevocable standby letter of credit from the bank.  And what the clause went on to say was that must be given to JM and AAR and as and when there are any late payments by SAAT under the agreement.  Then what AAR is entitled to do is draw down off the strength of the letter of standby credit from the bank that amount to make up the late payment.  And it is followed up because there is an obligation on the part of SAAT to make good any draw down which is then taken from the basis of the standby letter of credit from the bank.  And that is the reason why I say there is a completely different situation from a cash flow perspective for SAAT when it has to pay over – over three months in 2017 4.1 million US Dollars which we were told at the time by Mr Human was around R60 million as compared with a letter of credit sitting only able to be accessed by JM and AAR in the event of late payment.    Thank you Chair.    Indeed Chair I am indebted.    Given that contrast do you accept then that it is more onerous on SAAT to have to pay over in three tranches in 2017 R60 million than a situation in which AAR only has access to that money in the event of late payment by SAAT of invoices.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Memela you have given your evidence already on whether you regard the payment of the R60 million as having a negative impact on the cash position of SAAT.  What I would like to now move to is who stood to benefit from the payment of the R60 million in cash?  Because what I would like to put to you for your comment is the following.  You see if SAAT pays R60 million in the middle of 2017 to AAR you will recall that the arrangement between AAR and JM Aviation is that JM Aviation is entitled to 5% of all revenue derived under the contract.  Do you recall that?    So that means – thank you Chair.    That means that when SAAT paid over the total of R60 million.    For the deposit.    Indeed.  It was revenue generated pursuant to the contract for AAR and in terms of the JV agreement between AAR and JM Aviation, JM Aviation has an entitlement to 5% of that payment.  The consequence of which was that it was entitled to received R3 million.  That situation does not arise if there is a standby letter of credit from the bank that can only be drawn down in the event of non-payment.  Do you have a comment on that?    Did you make enquiries from AAR that that is how they were treating the 4.1 US Dollars – million US Dollars?    Thank you.  Ms Memela then I would just like to move to your particular role in this contract and preceding procurement process because you have emphasised your role in supplier development.    Is that correct?    I was moving Ms Memela to your particular focus on supplier development.    In relation to this tender and you actually highlighted for us the other day that it was a critical criteria of this bid that the bidders commit to supplier development.  Do you recall taking us to that?    Yes so supplier development was a critical criteria, correct?    Okay let us – I really did not anticipate a debate on this but let us go to the page of the critical criteria in the RFB.  It is at DD22.    E.    Yes.  At page 2062.      2062.    Do you see …    That there is a block on that page that says Phase 1 Critical Criteria?   Do you see that it includes Supplier Development?    So was your answer just now incorrect?    Right.  Let us look at what the critical criteria said about Supplier Development.  Chair, this is about the fourth line from the bottom within that table.    You will see a line that says “Supplier Development” …    And then there is an asterisk …    And it says   And then in brackets is says   Do you see that?    If you go then just over two pages to the definitions, because remember there was an asterisk that said we must look at the definitions.    You will find the definition at page 2-0-6-4.    Do you see that?    Ms Memela, just before we look at the definition of Supplier Development.  You have emphasised throughout your evidence that you had a particular focus on Supplier Development in this tender.  What I am interested in knowing is when you receive the CFST recommendation - you indicate in your evidence you had reviewed it. Did you take particular or did you pay particular attention to the Supplier Development aspects of the bids when you …    Signed off?    And were you aware that it was a critical criteria of the bill - of the bid.  Apologies.  That a proposal on Supplier Development had to be provided with the bid.    And if we go then to the definition of Supplier Development.  I just want us to look at what it says that proposal ought to have included.    You will find that at page 2-0-6-4 in the same bundle.  You will see at the bottom of that page there is a block    Certainly.  Why do you not read the …    Full paragraph?    Thank you.  Ms Memela, do you know then why after AAR and JM Aviation were awarded the bid.  You will recall the Board made the decision on 9 May and I think the letter communicating to them that they were successful went on about 13 May.  I think you authored that letter.    Why was AAR and JM Aviation allowed to submit their Supplier Development proposal after that date on 1 July 2016?        Ms Memela, this is the request for bid document.  Is it not that we are looking at?    Yes and on this page we are being told - this is 2-0-6-2 - what the evaluation criteria are of the bid and under “Critical Criteria” bidders are told - if we look at this block.  That supply - that they have a requirement for Supplier Development which must equal 10 percent of the contract value and include proposal.  How could that not mean that they must include their proposal when they bid?    How do you choose between the bidders then on Supplier Development if they do not include in their bid precisely what they are going to do for Supplier Development and what value they are going to ensure gets translated to the beneficiaries of that development?    But assume all of the bidders said yes.  I will commit 10 percent.  How do you choose between them if they have not been required with their bid to submit their proposal?    Bearing in mind those important elements that you read out.  You need to explain …    Benefit is going to be translated and what value will be received.    So Ms Memela, just to clarify.  Is it your evidence that there - the CFST Team did not evaluate the different proposals on Supplier Development that had been provided by the bidders?    That …    So the issue is whether they have said yes?    And then the proposal …    Happens afterwards?   Thank you Chair. Thank you Chair.  Ms Memela, the reason why I am focusing on the aspect of Supplier Development is because it was one of two reasons why the Board overturned the recommendation from the Acting CEO to award this tender to Air France.     Of course we can, let’s go there.     DD22F, page 2305.     Probably not Chair, we have read this a number of times, and where relevant we will just read it into the record.     DD ...[intervenes]      It is DD22F page 2305, oh I see Ms Mbanjwa wants to say something.     Before we look at the resolution Ms Memela I understood your evidence earlier to be what was required under that critical criteria was simply an indication yes there would be the commitment required of value and so the details of the proposal did not need to be provided with the bid, correct?        You see what concerns me about that is when the Board met on the 9 t h of May and they rejected the Acting CEO’s recommendation that this award be given to Air France they – the     How could they possibly have made that evaluation if there wasn’t a proposal required that could be compared.     Ms Memela a moment ago in your testimony you said that you believed the Board did not reject Air France on this basis, based on their tender, but on the basis of their previous performance under other contracts, is that correct?     Yes ...[intervenes]      Yes, I tried to take note of it word for word,     Ms Memela I am not focused on the second reason, I am focused on the supplier development reason.  I understand your evidence before this Commission to be the Board did not have a concern about Air France’s commitment to supply development in this tender.  It was concerned about previous failures on the part of Air France to commit adequately to supply development, is that correct?     Ja, you see Ms Memela let me tell you what the problem with that is.     The problem is that it means Air France oculd never have been awarded this tender by the Board.     Let me explain why.   Air France and AAR, JM Aviation both indicated on that critical criteria in their bid submissions yes to supplier development.   They made the commitment, and that was made clear to the Board in the submission from the acting CEO, so in terms of the bid requirements Air France and JM Aviation and AAR gave exactly the same commitment to supply development, but the Board at on the 9 t h of May and despite that decided that it was not going to award this tender to the recommended bidder, because of some historic non-commitment to supply development and if that is so the process was grossly irregular and there was no prospect of Air France ever winning that tender.  Do you have a comment on it?     Indeed Chair.     Thank you Chair.  I do intend to move to a different topic and that is just the steps taken to follow up on the compliance by AAR and J M Aviation of their contractual obligations under the tender.        So it is - what was your role in relation to ensuring that the commitments that had been given by J M Aviation and AAR under the contract were being fulfilled.  Did you play any role in that regard?     And the other contractual commitments like having a site manager in place at SAAT, is that something you were following up on?     Ja, I am just interested to know who would follow up about that?     Chair I see that we are just past the tea adjournment.     I have to say in my defence I truly did not anticipate this level of debate on my question about supply development.     But we – possibly it is convenient to take a short adjournment and return, I am in your hands.     I think we can take it now indeed.     Thank you Chair.  Miss Memela we were just dealing with the follow ups after the contract was concluded in relation to JM Aviation and AAR’s obligations.  What I am interested in is, we had evidence from Mr Human, that one of the obligations of JM Aviation under the contract was to have a full time rep on the premises and to support the day-to-day operations at SAAT, and his evidence was that it has never been done.  Did you follow up on that when you were in the procurement provision, that position?     Yes.     This was a specific [intervenes].     Sorry, apologies.     His evidence was that it had not, and it was not a general BEE supplier facility at SAAT.  It is a contractual obligation that JM Aviation have an on-site representative to assist on the day-to-day performance under the contract.  Did you ever check whether there was a JM Aviation representative performing that role after the contract was concluded?     Thank you, and then just the obligation to have the joint venture between JM Aviation and AAR Incorporated within twelve months of the agreement.  Are you aware of that obligation?     To have JM Aviation and AAR’s joint venture incorporated within twelve [intervenes].     Within a year.     Did anyone follow up on that?     So, by 20 July 2018 they needed to have an incorporated joint venture and they needed to have a local bank account.  To your knowledge did anyone follow up on whether they had fulfilled that obligation?      Sorry I meant, apologies, by July 2017 they had to have complied with those obligations.     Thank you.  Miss Memela, on the first day of your evidence which I have to say right now feels many days ago I am sure for you as well.     You raised the issue that I took you to a Conflict of Interest Policy at a point.      And you raised a concern about you, you were not aware of it and that, was there some proof that it had been adopted or not.  So pursuant to that request Chair, we engaged the person who heads the compliance and governance at SAA.  It is Mr Chadi, and he has been in that position since 2011.  He has provided an affidavit to the Commission.  Unless Miss Memela wants to go there, I do not think it is necessary for you to go there Chair.       The upshot of what Mr Chadi says     And you can certainly respond to it if you would like to Miss Memela.     It is in DD25(b) at page 752.     Yes, it should be right towards the end.  Mr Chadi says there that, he confirms he is the Compliance and Governance Officer at South African Airways and he makes clear he has been holding that position since 1 March 2011.  I am just going to paraphrase for the purposes of this point.  He indicates that the Conflict of Interest policy which group compliance is the custodian of, is a group policy applicable to SAA, its subsidiaries, apologies.     Oh, I did not realise that.     It is 752.     I am just waiting for Miss Mbanjwa to get there.     Thank you.  So what Mr Chadi goes on to say there that the Conflict of Interest Policy which group compliance is the custodian of, is a group policy applicable to SAA, its subsidiaries and out-stations.   The scope of the policy does include all subsidiaries of SAA and that includes SAA Technical and he goes on and says, in the absence of a Conflict of Interest Policy or any policy at the subsidiary level having been adopted, the group Conflict of Interest Policy or Group Policy shall be applicable.   So, what Miss Memela had been asking for the other day is evidence that it had been adopted.  What Mr Chadi has clarified for us is that it is the default is that it applies, but it will only not apply if some other policy has been adopted, as I read his affidavit, oh I am sorry I see there is a [intervenes].     And then he just clarifies further that the actual Conflict of Interest Policy that we dealt with in the evidence on Friday was applicable to SAAT at the time and is still applicable currently as no other Conflict of Interest Policy has been adopted by SAAT previously and currently.  And then he concludes by indicating that there is a process on annual internal communication to remind employees and to alert them of the Conflict of Interest Policy that was issued through My SA, SAA.  Chair he does not explain it there but it is the internal e-mail communication within SAA in or around April 2016 and he indicates they receive declarations from SAA and SAAT employees over the years, except that not everyone has complied.   And then what follows that in his, in the bundle is just some screenshots of when that was sent out which include Miss Memela as a recipient.  You will see that Miss Memela at page 754.  Do you have any basis to dispute what Mr Chadi is saying here?     Apologies [intervenes].     If I had said that it was in error,     Let me read it correctly    So, when the policy says this Conflict of Interest Policy shall be applicable to SAA group does that not mean what it says?  Let me give you the reference.  It is in DD25(a).     Miss Memela in fairness to you the clause that I read does go on.  It says, it is Clause 1.7 at page 439 of Annexure     And Mr Chadi seems to have been conducting compliance and governance at SAA with a position that says unless there is a contrary policy adopted, the Group Policy applies.  I understand your evidence to be unless there is a specific adoption it would not apply to SAAT.  Is that right?     So, what conflict of interest provisions did apply to SAAT employees for them to be able to give their annual declarations of interest?     Thank you.  Miss Memela I would like to then conclude with your evidence and in order to do so we have had evidence over four days, well three and a half now [intervenes].     So what I propose to do is to identify nine highlighting features of the evidence over the past four days, and I want to give you an opportunity to respond to those because it is an effort to round up what we have covered over the period [intervenes].     No, I will do one-by-one because it is a list of nine unless you would like me to give all nine [intervenes].     It is quite challenging indeed.     Indeed.     Yes.     So, what I put to you Miss Memela is that the     And in the course of your negotiations with JM Aviation about the price at which SAAT would sell the GPU’s you did not establish the fair market value of the GPU’s?     The third is that you supported the SAAT board’s decision to award the components tender to AAR and JM Aviation as justifiable and that was when at a time when there were calls from the SAA Chairperson for SAAT to cancel the contract, is that correct?     The fourth is that you failed to disclose to anyone else at SAAT that JM Aviation had been communicating with you and sending their bid proposal and JV agreement five days before their bid was due to be submitted for the final tender.  Is that correct?     And you have accepted, I think previously in your evidence, that that communication alone ought to have disqualified them from the bid, correct?     No Miss Memela, I recall your evidence to be, but you can tell me if you want to retract from that position.  You said you were not aware of it at the time.  But I put it to you that if you had been aware of it whether it would have been in breach of the requirements of the RFB for JM Aviation to communicate at all with you [intervenes].     And I understood your answer to be yes.     And the fifth is that you allowed a contract to be concluded between JM Aviation and AAR which had various detrimental clauses in it to SAAT.  Is that correct?     And that was Miss Mbheki in your view?     Or be it that she was subordinate to you and reported to you.  Correct?     It resulted in a BER rate contribution of 65 percent as opposed to the 70 percent that was stipulated in the request for bid.  Should I go a bit slower?     There was a BER rate ultimately concluded which did not follow the 70 percent contribution required in the RFB.  But that was reduced to 65 percent.     Oh, do you want to respond here?     There was no inclusion of a penalty clause in favour of SAAT.     Yes, you will recall Miss Mbheki’s challenge was that she never had an opportunity to review it because it was suddenly signed on the 7 t h of July.  Do you recall that?     Did you see fit to review the contract at any point to check that it adequately protected SAAT?     There was no inclusion of an escape clause or a termination clause for SAAT to extricate itself from the contract, was that in your view a prep to SAAT’s prejudice.     And the obligation to make the upfront deposit payment, do you regard that as being prejudicial to SAAT?     They did not - it was not a provision of the tender that they would be entitled to that upfront payment, was it?     But they won that bargain, it seems.     They won that bargain.     Yes.     I think I have given the respects in which it was detrimental.  I will now move to the next element to round up the evidence.  Miss Memela you have also failed to alert [intervenes].     I am sorry is there an issue?     To the list.     I think I might be on the same [intervenes].     The next is that you failed [intervenes].     Miss Memela the next is that you failed to alert finance to the fact that the contract with JM Aviation and AAR did not in fact require an upfront cash payment to be made.    Do you remember the email communications where the finance person says; I need to ask Ms Memela about this.  And then you respond with; according to the contract.    You were the only person who advised on the contract and what it provided.    Do you accept that you were responsible for contract management at SAAT?    Ms Memela do you remember an issue being raised by Mr Lionel Le Roux in March of 2017 around the AAR JM Aviation contract in some of the articles that had been circulating in the media about it?    I just want to ask do you remember it?    There is just a follow up Chair.    Because Ms Memela has been very emphatic in her evidence at the moment about not being responsible for contracts management and I would like to then take her to this email communication if I may.    I had not necessarily thought it would necessary but it seems to be.  You will find it in DD25B at page 757.    You see in the second half of that page there is an email from Mr Lionel Le Roux.    In which he raises these issues about the AAR contract.    I propose to paraphrase unless Ms Memela you think it is necessary for us to read to whole thing into the record.    The issue that Mr Lionel was raising ... (intervenes)    Oh, you do want it read. Hi colleagues, with regard to our conversation in the meeting on whether flight technical could join the SAAT contract I have attached a view articles which was published on this contract. The first article states that it is a five-year contract between SAAT and AAR Corporation in joint venture with JM Aviation as it- and it would cost 125 million US dollars. The second attachment is a request for an interim interdict by Air France against this maintenance contract.  The High Court rejected this application but it does indicate that AAR jv JM Aviation has submitted a final bid price of US dollars 82 476 062 dollars.  It begs the question why the big increase between the contract and tender prices. And then he goes on to say; The last two attachments deal with the HAWKS investigation into Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas and his alleged involved in an MOU between SAAT and AAR which was signed in 2015.  Please defer the research to have a clearer understanding around the consideration to join this component maintenance contract.    He had circulated that to people other than you.    And then what happened is above that is Bongani Tshabalala responds- Chair I am now in the middle of the page to say; Speak to Mario ... (intervenes)    Dukwana or Mike Kenny, Lionel.    And then Mario Dukwana responds- you have to go back a page to 756.  This is still on the 14 t h of March.  And what Mario Dukwana says is; Hi Bongani, I am unable to positively answer your email as I do not have full knowledge of the AAR contract or the current status on any legal matters.   I have copied Advocate Nontsasa and Kuki on this email.  I am sure they will be able to clarify your matter as set out in your email below.  Regards.    And then you respond at the top of page 756.    And you say; Dear Lionel, I am very surprised by your email.  Does this mean you have forgotten already who to communicate with regarding any contracts that have gone through procurement?  You worked for SAAT you should know exactly which department is running these processes.    Then you go into a detail ... (intervenes)    Yes.    So what I am struggling with is why you would respond to a colleague on the basis that he should have been communicating with you and your department about contracts management and the terms of the contract that has gone through a tender process if in your previous evidence you were saying you were not- you did not play that role.    Ms Memela in your interactions with finance about the payment of the deposit.  You indicated to them that the contract required a cash deposit to be paid and that was in circumstances where the contract did not require it.  Do you have a comment on that?    When you were interacting with finance.    About the payment of the deposit.    You indicated to finance that the contract required that the payment be made.  And I put it to you, that was in circumstances when the contract actually did not require a payment to be made.    Thank you Chair.    And Ms Memela all of those aspect of your role that I have highlighted took place at a time after JM Aviation paid the 1.2 million rand towards the purchase of your Bedfordview house.  Is that correct?    Which one did not happen after?    I will get to the link in a moment.    I just want to ... (intervenes)    The link is really the following Ms Memela.  I want to put it to you that as a result of accepting that monetary benefit from JM Aviation you were improperly influenced to favour them in their dealings with SAAT.  Do you want to respond to that?    Indeed Chair.    Thank you Chair, those are our questions.    Thank you Chair.    No.    Indeed.  Indeed Chair.    Indeed.    Certainly Chair.    Indeed. 
MS MEMELA:  Thanks.  Are you ready?    Thanks Chair.    31?    88.  I am here Chair.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Are we – sorry Chair are we in 3813 now?    3183    Okay.      Hm.    Hm.    3182?    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    I recall.    Do I understand it?    That it had an impact?    Chair I promised yesterday.    Ja.    No I do not accept and – yes.    Remember the question yesterday was about the guarantee right that what was my understanding if like we were to give the guarantee versus the cash right.  And I said because I do not have a financial background but the understanding of a guarantee is that even if SAAT were to give a guarantee that is my understanding now is that there should be money that is put there by SAAT regardless.  So there is no difference anyway.  In terms of like the cash – cash – given cash to AAR and then SAAT having cash at the bank and sending the guarantee.  That cash still belongs to SAAT.  So that is my understanding regardless of the fact that I did say that I do not have the financial background.  This is something that should be answered by a finance person.    Okay.    For me it does not make any difference Chair.    Do I understand if the – what the draw…    I do not.    Is it the same file?    Yes me too Chair.    Ja. I am fine.    It is just like I mean the clause says.    Ja.    But if she – she wants to go there she can.  I am okay with that.    So Chair I do not know if I understand Ms Hofmeyr properly.  I think she was explaining to me so that I understand.  The letter of credit.    Will just sit there with no money – sitting at the bank.    Oh okay.    Hm.  It gives assurance.    Hm.    There is – ja.  Yes.    It will sit there.    Hm.    Okay.    Before there is any...    Okay I get it.    Thank you Chair.  It is clear.    Chair I will put it this way.      It was not onerous to SAAT.    To pay that amount.    Because remember failure to pay that amount would bear consequences to SAAT.    SAAT their function is to service aircrafts.    And servicing aircraft like you use the spares that is supposed to be provided by AAR.  And like SAAT not paying that amount of money AAR like had that – what you call – entitlement to keep or not give us the like the component so that we can work on the aircraft.      And that causes an aircraft on the ground which department that gets blamed if the aircraft is on the ground is procurement.  They will always say Nontsasa because she is not a technician she does not understand these things.  We do not understand why she is sitting at procurement anyway.  And it would start there from the failure to pay.  So that is why you see when she is reading all these emails I understand the – like she is trying to make everybody understand but like I mean another person would interpret it as Nontsasa as pushing so hard for AAR to pay only to find out that I was pushing for their company so that they get the component.  Because AAR made it very clear from day 1 that it is their policy as well to get the deposit.  So we – we [indistinct] and show that like we get the component on time because remember this was a big contract.  One supplier, international supplier comes in the other one is going out.  Be it [indistinct] so because like I mean they have also lost the case in court.  And there will be lots of sabotage there and then the aircraft will be on the ground but like nobody is going to check if like I mean finance has paid – not paid everybody is going to look at procurement because procurement is the one that purchases all these components. Yes so I am talking about those kinds of – I understand what Ms Hofmeyr is trying to understand but it terms from the finance point of view but like the consequences that the company would face are matched.    Hm.    Yes but that is – I mean I do not understand how…    I remember that Chair but ja.    Alright.    For the deposit.    Okay.    I do Chair.    And I will not take long.  But my understanding of the deposit – security deposit is that as much as like I mean it would have been paid cash and stuff but it still belongs to SAAT right.  It is just that it is paid over to guard against any other maybe failure to deliver from the SAAT side.  So for me that cannot be defined as a revenue.  I will make an example of like the rental process where like I mean the tenant pays the deposit and then you have to keep that deposit in the – what interest bearing account.  So that like I mean if there is nothing that happened during this contract you are able to pay back the amount.  So I am – I do not see that as the revenue.  That is my understanding.    Chair why?    No Chair.    Because I promised that I would be crisp, no.    No, no Chair I am fine.    Hm.    No I am okay Chair.    I am okay.    I did not think you would notice.    I am sorry.    Ja.    It was one of the elements of the tender Chair. There is a difference between the critical criteria and I took this commission through the elements and I said here are the critical criteria phase 1.  Phase 2 is BEE and price.  Phase 3 is reciprocal supplier development and I did even explain that okay at valued 10% each, 10% each.      Let me explain.    You were not clear as well.    No Chair.  There was a critical criteria.    It was under Phase 1.  Right.    Phase 1 will be the capability of each bidder.    They will be able to provide like the type of parts that SAAT is looking for and all these technical things.    Like I mean…    Okay it was not a critical criteria it was part of the elements of the tender.    DD22.    E?    Page sorry?    2062.    Oh.  Yes Chair.    Yes.  I - I see.    Ja.  Okay.    I see also they put …    Ja.  It was incorrect.    Ja.    The contract value, ja.    Ja.    I see that.    Hm.    Okay.    I see that.    Hm.    When I signed off?  Chair, when - when the recommendation to a submission is - is delivered to me for me to look - look at.  As I have said …    From the CFST.    It - it - what - a brief summary of what the - the process that they have gone through evaluating and adjudicating and whatever.  In the adjudication or like CFST Team there is a Senior Manager Supplier Development who is responsible for running that part in there when they are doing the evaluation and stuff. As I have said that also like from the legal and contracts management point of view there is also Ms Mbeki who is responsible for that part.  So of course like I mean when they voted.  They are voting now overall story like on - on the elements that they have rated when they were vote - when they were voting. So it is not like - I do not remember the submission, but like - it is not like they - they just write about Supplier Development on its own and then I have to look at that.    I do not remember - I do not remember, but like remember Chair I - I had said to you when you asked about the submission.  I pay attention to everything to ensure that it is flowing and everything that needs to be there before it gets to the Board is in there.    I do not remember whether I paid particular attention to it.    Yes, but I - I remember that they had put that okay the - the - what do you call?  The - the JV Partner for Air France was Kwane Capital.    Yes.    Okay.    Can I read it?    Can I read it Chair?    Okay. “SAAT has embarked on a Supplier Development Program with a list of nominated suppliers being approved by the SAAT Board to promote the development of our local economy.  SAAT considers any mentorship partnerships, skills transfers, knowledge transfers, assistance in developing a local company to become sustainable in an area that a local company currently does not have capability.  SMME job creation, training and development and/or any sustainable economic growth through revenues accumulated over the fulfilment period to be possible initiative that are considered as Supplier Development. Other initiatives include research and development and/or technology transfer.  As a result bidders are requested to supply a proposal on how and what they would impart in terms of skills training, technical information etcetera to a local South African vendor.  Bidder to indicate what value they would place on each area of development based on the above which they will be imparting to the local vendor.”    Hm.    Chair - Chair, there is no - for instance - timeframe in terms of submitting the proposal.  As long as it is going to be adhered by the - both parties within the timeframe, but like let me first address this.  Remember the CFST initially awarded Air France and even on Air - Air France I do not know if Ms Hofmeyr was going to ask me about Air France, but even Air France had not submitted that proposal. So like they were also going to be given a chance to submit that proposal, because remember the proposal should be submitted after both parties like maybe visit each other.  Go and check what is in there, because remember they are talking about skills development, technology transfer and no how. That is when they will find out that okay like maybe this local company needs training on this and they need support from us from this side.  So that - that is when they will be able to put together that proposal and then they will sign it and say okay.  This is what we are putting down.  That like we going to be doing for this local supplier.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  My understanding Chair as much as I do not sit there.  Ms Hofmeyr read here saying Supplier Development must equal to 10 percent of the contract value and then it says include a proposal.  Right.    So like there is in that bracket - there is nothing that says okay.  Make sure that you include a proposal within the - the tender period …    And I can tell you now sir …    Chair, if they do that then they will be …    Okay.  Thanks.    Alright.    Okay.  Thanks.    This is the request for bid document that is used by the CFST.  Yes.    Chair, okay again I will be …    Just putting my opinion.    Ja.    Evaluation.    Hm.    Oh.    What is my answer to that?  Okay Chair.  My understanding as much as this is the knowledge of the CFST.  My understanding is that like the bidders maybe they were given an opportunity to give commitment.  I am not sure if there was that commitment from Air France, from AAR. I know - I - I do know that there was no such commitment from Lufthansa, but like if they give commitment. At least like I mean the proposal will be worked on based on the commitment that they have made that we commit to the Supplier Development that like this is what we are going to work on.  Once they understand, because Chair it is just like I mean we are running out of time and you have asked me to give crisp - this is broader than how it looks.    I will give you the - the example.    For instance like that we once asked Air France and Israel Aerospace to give us what is it that they can give back to the country and stuff and then they just gave us three page promising this and that and that and when you sit back and look at it, because they do not know.  They do not have a background about South Africa or any of these local suppliers.  What is their need and stuff? They just came up with that from their head, because they have not sat down. So it - it is not a good idea to do the proposal at that stage, because you have not sat with these people now after the agreement has been done.  So that is my understanding.    But like I mean the 10 percent - if they say Chair they are committing to give 10 percent towards Supplier Development.  They are giving 10 percent towards reciprocal work.  Already they have committed.  They are all now after that like to put on the proposal is to just list down - break down what is it that is going to be done specifically.    Hm.    Huh-uh.  No.    Chair, remember …    Remember …    The evaluation - my understanding they are not evaluating based on the list of what the suppliers have - have promised and listed down.  That okay I am going to build school in - in that rural area.  I am going to build toilets and - and hospitals.  It is not about that.  It is about committing and then like once we know exactly what is the need of the local suppliers, because remember we are managing these suppliers. We will be able to say okay.  This is what is needed from you.  You understand.  So like I am - it - it works like that.  So it is not like I mean when Ms Kate says - you can see even they comply.  It says yes or no.  Right.  Did you see the - that form that she took us to?    It says yes or no.  So like once they commit to that …    It is up to the company now to say okay.  This is what you have committed on.  Here is the local supplier.  Let us - let us discuss and then like they put …    Down …    The proposal and like go all over.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Ja.    But Chair …    Okay Chair.    Let us say now sitting around the table the people that are doing the - busy with the CFST the evaluation - the adjudication.  They are sitting there.  Let us say now it is possible what - what you think might have happened.  Like - like they are here - the proposals made by these multinational companies. That okay we are going to do this for the supplier that we have come with and we are going to do that and that and that.  How without the local supplier sitting in that table will those people internal at SAAT know that indeed what is written there in that proposal is something that is needed by the supplier?    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Chair …    Hm.    Chair, it is about committing to the supplier.  I - I can - you see the - the elements that are listed there as critical criteria.  I    Chair …    Let me give an example of the NIP obligation.    Before the Supplier Development …    Which is like I mean now will - will be controlled by SAAT.  The NIP Obligation - these multinational companies were expected to pay 30 percent of the value of the contract.  Right.  Back to DTI and if that was the case also for Supplier Development for NIP Obligation that was done afterwards.  Once the multinational company wins. Then we will write a letter to DTI and say okay.  Bridgestone, Air France and who or whoever have - have won this tender.  Take over.  Now what they do.  The first thing that they do they - they enter into a - an MOU.  That does not really state what the 30 percent will be - will be used to do, because like DTI through these multinational companies. They have to go through research and check within the country that 30 percent what can it be used to - to develop maybe certain communities and stuff.  So like these are the things that are done afterwards.  After the tender has been done.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    (Intervenes).    Commitment.    For instance you see Chair.    You see - you see Chair.  There - there is …    No.    I - I - since I am saying I do not sit in the CFST.  It might be - maybe I do not know.  Maybe there is a letter.  Maybe Ms Hofmeyr - Hofmeyr can share with us since she is asking more about AAR that eventually won.  If there was a proposal from Air France.    Yes.  Ja.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Ja.    Well Chair for - for me from where I am sitting.    The people that sit around that table …    CFST Members.    Most of them - as you have seen some of the affidavits …    Are technicians …    That have been working at SAAT for over 35 years without ensuring or maybe pushing these multinational suppliers to give back to this country.  So you - you see that - that is where my - my uncomfort comes from.  That like I mean we would expect the CFST Members that have been sitting at SAAT for 35 years like with NIP Obligations applicable already at that time. Not doing anything to make sure that these people are giving back to the country.  We have a - a country like China to buy - those people do not compromise when they give you a contract.  You must give back to their country.  So like the NIP Obligation people and Supplier Development is for that.  So like now those people that are sitting there they did not even understand what Supplier Development is about. They did not even understand what NIP Obligation - in fact they were against it completely.  So for - for us to expect them to be the one who decide and evaluate in detail what is a proposal.  Of course any multinational suppliers, because they have been working with them for long …    And they will just put whatever that makes everybody happy …    At that - in that table.    CFST.    After the bid - after they have committed and then like the bidder has won.  Then like …    Remember then there will be an involvement of this local supplier.    At least they will be able to give them information.  Here is our need.  Here is the gap.    These people like this 10 percent they can give it to transfer of skills.    We need the computers for us to be able to help them transfer like supply parts and stuff.    It will be done after the contract is done.  No, no.  It - it could be done before the contract is signed …    Because remember the award for instance maybe it will be made - it will be signed May and then the contract commences in October.    So somehow if it happens.    The contract like it could be done with - before the contract gets signed, but at the end of the day even if it is not done there …    Like there should be maybe valid reasons why it was not finalised by then.    Ja.    Yoh.    Okay Chair.    Maybe then I - I am not …    I may - I may sound like I am - I am defending …    The CFS - CFST, but I am saying Chair …    Oh.    Oh.  Okay.    No, but I just wanted to add that …    Like remember that - that was - this was a new program at SAAT.    Like unlike the likes of Transnet, because we are following their lead also.  Unlike the likes of Eskom that have already started doing this like already had certain frameworks …    In place and stuff.    So for - for SAAT it was a teething phase.    Ja.    No.  I did not say that.  I said like I am sure they evaluated their commitment and the fact that this form says yes or no.    If they say - if - if they say yes then like they will evaluate that based on yes.  Like as you see that also on the operational or technical ones where it says BR rate 70 percent.  They will say yes.  Remember also there the BR is something that like you have to go down and give it a breakdown for everybody to understand, but as long as they say yes.  You - you keep them to that commitment.    Yes.    I am not sure - remember     Remember - remember Ms Hofmeyr I do not sit there.  So like I am not sure maybe that is why I was saying maybe in your - in your files you may have like some letters for Air France or for other bidders.  Like seems like now you are asking about AAR and JM, but like I mean remember the initial bidder that was awarded was by the CFST and - and Supply Chain Management was Air France. So you see Chair like I will understand if this question was coming - okay.  Ms Memela Air France had put this proposal …    And stuff and then like now here is AAR.    Ja.  I …    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    That is your …?    Okay.  Chair, I see Ms Hofmeyr is focusing on Supplier Development.  No, no.  I want to … (intervenes).    Yes.  I am giving an example.  Just bear with me.  There is - there …    No.  I want something that is the same.    Yes.    That one.    Yes.    Yes.    From me.    Yes Chair.  I - I like giving examples.  So like there is reciprocal work.  There also it has a bracket that says include proposal.    Hm.    Okay.  You said what would be expected from me as an HOD is to do what?    Huh-uh.    Yoh.    Your expectation - yoh.  Must I tell a Judge he is incorrect?  I do not feel comfortable saying that.    I - I do not …    I do not want to put it that way Chair.    I do not want to put it that way.  Your - your expectation …    Is reasonable.    I think I - I might be …    Yes.    It is reasonable and justifiable …    But …    You said like I mean from the HOD SCM is expected to know the processes of procurement that have to be followed.    That …    Is one thing that like I am not even - like it is something that like I follow or maybe     Adhere to all the time.    Remember like I mean the process of procurement are ...[intervenes]     Stated in the PPPFA.    The Constitution 2-1 - 2-1-7, the PFMA and stuff like that.    Something different - different from what is expected from the CFST that are doing the evaluation.    Right.  So you - you see if I actually had access to get in there …    In the CFST and sit there and decide with them …    And evaluate with them.  Then I would say your expectation of me …    Are correct …    But like I mean …    And if I was sitting here today …    Or maybe for the past three days - I am - I am being questioned about the process that was not followed and then like there was an Auditor General finding.  That said okay like in this procurement at SAAT these were not done according to the procurement processes in the Public Sector.  I am not sitting - I am not sitting here for that. I am sitting here answering questions that have nothing to do with procurement processes at SAAT.  You understand, but like I mean it is just like I mean the CFST that well they - they accept the - the - the what?  The commitment as it is or did they just say yes or no and like my - my uncomfort also Chair is the fact this question is actually only just directed to one specific bidder.  Not all of them.     Can we go to the Board Resolution?     Thank you.     DD22F.     Yes.     Oh I thought you said like we must not ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Thank you, thanks for asking that.   Chair the Air France that we are talking about, like Ms Hofmeyr’s question is that how would they have reached that conclusion since there was no proposal made.  Remember Air France was the current supplier for component for SAAT since 2008, right and during that time until 2016 Air France has given nothing back to this country through that contract, and like that could have been supply development or maybe since supply development was not applicable maybe back then, it could have been through NIP obligation but I can tell you now Chair through their representative, like that was staying here in South Africa for years being paid through the same contract that is paid with the money coming from this country they could have maybe appointed or gotten a South African, give them that job to say okay you will be our representative, we will train you, you will do, you will represent our contract in South Africa, that is what is meant about giving back to the country, but like from 2008 to 2016 Air France had a contract, a component contract with SAAT for all those years, they never adhered to either NIP obligation nor any other transformational agenda.   My understanding of that statement by the Board, they are not referring to the tender process that was run in 2016, they are referring to the contract that in 2008 that they never adhered to the laws of this country. You see Chair like I think for me the way I am quite passionate about like things that have to do with BEE and empowering black owned suppliers, black people in South Africa, these things touch me because I mean we are quick to say for instance State Capture is standing for South Africa as a State, and questioning everything that may have – our money spent like I mean irregularly, like taxpayers money, but we are unable to question European countries and all the other countries like that are given huge contracts from us, South Africa and they are not giving back to this country. The purpose of NIP obligation was to ensure that these people when they get these billion rand of contract they give back to this country.  We don’t have schools, we don’t have hospitals, nothing, and they enjoy our money for free.     Yes Chair.     Air France.     Chair I know for a fact that as Advocate Hofmeyr has been stating here for the last three days that supply development, like NIP obligation is an obligation and I also explained, like I said an obligation but controlled and managed by the DTI.     She read the affidavit from DTI you see and remember the duty of an SOC at that time ...[intervenes]      No I am answering your question.     Exaclty, the duty of an SOC at that time is to just notify DTI right and then like I mean then the communication will be between DTI and Air France, but like I am saying I know for a fact from 2008 until the end of that contract Air France had never delivered anything according to the laws of this country, giving back to the economy of this country.   Mmm.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.     At around 2013 Chair.     Yes no but if you noticed I referred to NIP obligation.     Yes, because remember NIP obligation has been in place since 1997.     So like they can’t come up with an excuse that okay because supplier development was not there and stuff, but like NIP obligation was there, that 30% from their contract should have came to this country through DTI, so of course like I mean questions should have been asked from DTI, maybe they have their reasons why they let them go scot-free, we don’t know.     Hey, hah, no, I ...[intervenes]      Or Chair or it is like maybe they said based on their previous performance and stuff.    Can you repeat your question, maybe, ja.     Just now?     Yesterday.     I said, like I mean the supply development they had listed it as one of the reasons and like just two minutes or three minutes ago I actually just gave an example that Air France had a contract with SAAT and never adhered to the NIP obligation, so like I said okay supply development may have been one of that you know and also the additional reason I think it was the risk that they had listed ...[intervenes]     Oh yes I agree Chair.     Yes, no I agree, they did not – I doubt they had a concern because remember Air France had bidded with Aqwana Capital so they adhered to the final contract.     Oh?     Oh, why?     (laughing)     I am really confused Chair, maybe because I ran the procurement process, I don’t know ...[intervenes]      There is no way here that says ...[intervenes]      Yes Chair     Yes Chair.     Oh.     Chair I say Chair in this board resolution it does not say like I mean because remember even yesterday I said sometimes the minute taking differ from one company secretary to the other so here the company secretary says here are the following comments that were made by the Board and the Board made the comment that management’s rationale for recommendation that Air France be awarded the tender was not substantive considering the bidder has the chance to align itself to South African Development Agenda that is supply development.   Furthermore the benefits as outlined by the submission as a result of selecting Air France were not compelling enough to position the latter as the preferred bidder.  But Ms Hofmeyr when she reads this she reads it as if the Board declined the recommendation by the Acting CEO because of supplier development.   So you see I mean these were comments that were made in the Board meeting.     What she had stated like it is pity I wouldn’t want for us to go back to the transcript and stuff but like she said because ...[intervenes]      In that discussion Chair the company secretary has recorded that discussion ...[intervenes]      It was one of the reasons that was stated in the comment but it could not be a reason to reject the recommendation in the way it was put.     Remember Chair when my understanding is that like if the Board is not expected, I am not a Board member right, but my understanding like of corporate governance or company law is that I mean the Board does not sit there to rubber stamp whatever is put in front of it.     Supply chain, mmm, Chair she made a statement that the Board like it looks like Air France wouldn’t have won anyway because the Board ...[intervenes]       Oh, okay.     She says she is not interested in the other reason.     For me what I read there Chair, maybe our interpretation may not be the same, but like what I read there, there are – the Board before it makes a decision my understanding is that they go through discussions and discuss and raise their concerns here and there and stuff like that, so how this – like I mean this paragraph is recorded here, it says like I mean the Board made the following comments and then like here it is stated that okay they even raised that leg because they have not adhered to the supply development and wharrah-wharrah-wharrah, so like for me I am interpreting this as a comment, not the reason that the Board relied on to make their final decision.     Okay Chair.     The steps taken by?     Of course like I mean there will be discussions but they will not be run by me, they will be run by the unit that is responsible for that, being BEE and Supply Development following up and discussing what is it that has to be in the proposal as I said earlier Chair, that okay they would sit and sit with a local supplier and discuss what needs to be there and they might call me in if they need my guidance on certain things and stuff, ja.     Site manager also it is part of the – site manager would be part of the proposal that is put in place, and I remember there was a small program that was run by BEE and Supply Development Unit that they were actually arranging office space for BEE companies like to have offices at SAAT, so that like when they are working with these multinational companies at least they are within the site, so that will be part of the plan ja.     It will be Ms Princess Tshabalala who will be – who was finding out okay where is the office, maybe she will find a space where there is a scrap that is sitting there that is no longer used and try and see if it could be opened for some suppliers, but she was not only doing it for J M, like there were lots of other suppliers that were given office space including Ms Sambo who has been with other BEE suppliers, being kicked out by Mr Schalk Human, they no longer have the office space at SAAT, it is a reversal actually of the transmissional agenda.     I’m sorry Chair.     Finish.     Did I follow up that there was a rep?     Chair, as I have explained earlier that my understanding, all the BEE suppliers like that are representing either their multi-national suppliers or they are coming on their own.  We had offices arranged for them to be there at SAAT, so if I remember correctly there was someone from JM but like I never got to meet them because like remember there was Senior Manager BEE and supplier development that was running that. Yes so [intervenes].     So [intervenes].     So, I am not sure what is the view of Mr Human.  Remember Mr Human has never been there when these transactions happened.  He was only asked to act in my previous position, I think just last year so whatever he is giving here is either hearsay or whatever [intervenes].     Ja.     Oh, okay.     Yes Chair     Yes, but my understanding is also that like maybe in his position he would have met with the current supplier to find out if that had happened.       I have never checked that Chair because there was a representative who is responsible for that and who reports to me, and my, and the reporting was that like there was somebody who is coming from JM and there was somebody coming from SAAT, from AAR who is able to answer some technical questions.      There is an obligation to, to have?     Within a year     Yes, I think I do remember that Chair.     I think we had followed up but like not me specifically, and I am not sure how far it is right now because I can remember like I do not follow up like on behalf of my, the people that are responsible for certain roles.      In 2018 Chair, I was already out of sight so I would not know.     I have no knowledge of, ja.     Me too as well     Yes. ADV KATE HOFMEYR    Yes.     Oh.     Okay.     I would like to.     752.     Oh, I am still trying to find [intervenes].     I found it Chair.      Chair, [intervenes].     Firstly ...[intervenes].      Okay.     Yes.  I am getting there Chair.      Yes.  Chair I – I – I wanted to correct that.       The statement that has been made by Miss Hofmeyr.  She said Mr Chadi is the Head of Risk and Compliance for SAA.  She is not.     I heard her ...[intervenes].      No, it is not here.     Ja she said that.       Yes, so I just had to correct her statement because that what she put out there on the public that he is the head.  So, yes I know Mr Chadi, yes.     I dispute it to a certain extent that he is saying that if there, is it like some of the subsidiaries have not adopted the policy, automatically this one does.     Exactly.     No, no I am saying I dispute that [intervenes].     Exactly.      Maybe if Miss Hofmeyr can actually show me that provision within that , because it should not just be coming from Mr Chadi, it should also be stated in the policy that failure by each subsidiary to adopt their own that is applicable to them.   Therefore, this one automatically applies.  I will tell you why I say that Chair, it is because the SCM policy is the Group Policy and like there is a, where it talks about applicability.  It says this policy applies to group SAA and unless where it is stated otherwise.   So like I mean in that then it shows okay, there is a chapter that talks to SAAT and then like where SAAT like because where SAAT is the technical side of SAA, it talks about like the procurement processes of SAAT.  So, I am saying I do not agree with Mr Chadi.  It is his version and I am stating my version.     Yes, I am saying Chair so if there was something in that policy like the SCM policy says okay, unless stated otherwise automatically if the subsidiary does not adopt its own policy this one automatically applies.     I do not have to go there Chair but I am saying yes.     What, policies are specifics, for instance like this one is it says outside to be adopted by subsidiaries, and then like I said okay, but like there is none that is adopted that I know of, that should be signed by the board of SAAT.   My understanding is that SAAT is a freight company from SAA with its own registration number, with its own policies and stuff, so like I mean this one should also be there signed by the board and the accounting officer of  SAAT being the CEO.     Yes, I dispute his statement and I even gave an example of SM Chair and now I am giving you an example of the DOA.  SAA for instance has got its own DOA which is also ran by the same Mr Chadi’s department.  And then like SAA has got its own DOA, then SAAT has got its own separate DOA that is signed by the board and CEO of SAAT.      Thank you.     That is right.       I do not remember any Conflict of Interest Policy Chair at SAAT that is written as you had read correctly there Miss Hofmeyr that the department risk and compliance like should be going to subsidiaries and presented to Exco and stuff.  I do not remember because as I said first, I was the minute taker for Exco before I became an Exco member.  So, I would remember this kind of decision being taken.       Yes Ma'am.     Okay so we going to highlight, finish and then I respond? [Intervenes].     No, I was not going to, I thought she will just round up like read everything and then I would respond in one go.      Okay.     With yes-no-yes-no.  I am hoping the style of questioning will be like that Chair as well.     Thank you Chair.     That is not true Chair.     Ja they did not establish any what, book value other than us in writing down on his submission to the board, and Chayile raising that he was not happy and ja so.     Yes, Chair because like there was no tender that was ran.  The only time procurement establishes fair value is go through tenders, yes.     Chair please.       Okay Chair.     Of course based on the board minutes that she had read for me but I do remember that Miss Dudu Myeni was extremely not happy about the board decision and when on the 15 June when this was discussed on the board meeting.   It was us like now standing up for SAAT.  Not who has made what decision and who is against what and who does not support.  I still stand by my version saying we were all shocked by that decision by the board that okay they just made that decision there but like they had their own reasons, ja I am done.     Ja     Yes Chair.     Because it gives a certain, yes I, because of that, those board minutes and what like was discussed there in June and after the board had justified responding to Miss Dudu Myeni why this was done and National Treasury, yes.     It is correct Chair; I did not disclose because I do not sit in evaluation team.       That qualification that communication with the evaluation team, the people, because like even the document says this document, and they are the ones who know that document.  I said okay if I was sitting there, it would have disqualified them.       Oh Ok.     Yes.  Yes, Chair thank you.      I allowed?  That is not true Chair.  There is a person who is responsible for that, who leads the negotiation and stuff.     Yes Chair.     She reported to me but like yes, she was leading the legal and contracts management so that is her role, yes.  And like or of course always when there are other issues that they are not happy with for instance I will make an example Chair quickly.   The fact that like she said she was not happy with the penalty, being not like in the contract [intervenes].     Ja so my understanding that like I had a very close relationship with my staff and like she, that is the one something that she would have raised with me and then like I would have supported her and saw how we close that gap, but instead like she continued and like maybe the contract would have been reviewed and amended.   And remember like there was lots of other negotiations after the contract was signed so it would have been reviewed if she had raised that, ja.      Can I ...[intervenes].      The BER rate that was stated there that was exactly what I had made an example earlier on that.  That is one thing that if it is, we do not have a background of also the public out there does not understand the background of course it would be taken as such.   But the BER, my understanding like it involves the repairs, what is some of the spares are damaged and they have to be sent back for repair and there are certain days that like mean it needs to take for SAAT to send back but so far while I was still there Chair is that the fact that when I called the meeting like after I complained about that.   There was a report that proved that actually it was from SAAT side that there was even that, even those charges from AAR side of late submission of the spares and all that like I mean so there it is a bit technical.   So, I think it will work even much better if a technician explains better but I am saying it was from SAAT side that was lacking so they were supposed to actually follow a certain period to send then like I mean then the spare gets repaired and comes back but they would wait for seventy two hour and then until AAR replaced that spare with a new one and they end up charging SAAT.  So, the problem now is from operations or materials management failed to manage that part.       Oh, okay.  I think I have already answered that, Chair.      To state.     To SAAT.  Okay, Chair.     If that is the case of course like after I have seen that [intervenes].      It was a bit prejudicial but I think if it was raised by the person who was managing legal and contracts the contract would have been reviewed before we added like I mean the lists of aircrafts on the contract.     Remember Miss Hofmeyr the contract is still running, Chair.  I travelled with Miss Mbheki to London to negotiate with AAR like in terms of additional aircraft and other things in the contract.  So my understanding is that like before we left South Africa with Mr Mike Kenny as well she would have said okay you know what okay I think this is an opportunity and then tell me also that boss actually I never had the sight of the contract before it was signed because, that was never reported to me you understand?   So like I mean when we go there we would have then said okay other than because I remember before we flew to London we discussed certain things that we have to make sure that are added in the contract.  And she was there being the one who is talking on the legal framework so my understanding is that like she should have pushed also for that or maybe let me and Mike Kenny understand that okay that penalty is not there therefore it should be reviewed.  So that amendment it would have like added there the penalty.     Chair, I would have to say inadequate to review if the person who is managing who is responsible for managing the contract had raised certain gaps within the contract because my understanding also like I before I brought Cookie in I was holding her position before I joined procurement.   So, my understanding is that when you manage a contract you go through it and then raise certain gaps that okay actually this is not to the benefit to the company therefore like to close this gap this is what I need to do.  I always say sometimes if there is some sort of unhappiness like within the contract within two parties there is nothing that like stops both parties to sit down and say okay hey well maybe it was done in a rush or something like that, let us sit and see if we could close that gap.  I do not remember that being raised.     That if it is true Chair it is also quite and [intervenes].      Ja, exactly like I mean that is like my understanding from the legal point of view and the person who had managed contracts before.     Chair, in that day, that first day when we sat there when I admitted that I was actually sitting during the negotiation I remember we - we - we fought tooth and nail.   I was sitting there watching her. Supporting her as she was negotiating on behalf of the company and she pushed back.   And remember AAR were having to show the whole team that it is their policy.  Their board would not even approve if this if this is not done and stuff like so I am saying now from SAAT’s side that was really defended during the negotiation.   That is why then there was that kind of like I mean the agreement at the end that said okay maybe they could have it spread over six months but like I mean that did not happen.  You have established that.     It was not a provision of the tender.  It was not on the tender Chair.  I think that is the reason why we were really sceptical about it.     They?     They won?     Well, do I say yes or no Chair?     Okay yes, I guess like she did not get what she wanted.     Also, I thought these were nine      Oh, okay.  Askies then.     Oh okay.     Oh, I understand okay.     To her list.     I am sorry.     Chair, can I take the water?     Okay.     I …     No I am hearing it is just I was not aware that I had like that there was that expectation from me to alert finance when finance was sitting during negotiation and CFO sits at EXCO and understanding is that he knew exactly what was happening. 
ADV LINDELWA MBANJWA:  I see it Chair and I withdraw.  And I thank my colleague for pointing it out.    And the reason was not because there was any malice on my part it is because of the questions and cross-examinations that followed.      Which made me then assume that.  Although there was an exculpatory line that is the bottom line the concentration was on the middle.      Fair enough I apologise to Ms Hofmeyr.    But the reason was because of the line of questioning.    As it pleases.    Thank you Chair.  Once more I understand your point and I ..[not speaking into the microphone]    Thank you Chair.  Chair I will not be long.  I had already explained my objections yesterday but I repeat this question is unfair to be put to this witness.  And secondly Ms Hofmeyr does not have the knowledge to phrase this question and I will explain just now why.  She says, do you understand…    Yes.    Yes Chair.  I just want to explain myself.  If I have used a wrong language let me say she is not in a position to know how the draw down works. This is a…    I want to give Chair if Chair can just give me time.  This is a financial arrangement.    It is common cause in this hearing that Ms Memela is supply chain.  There is a person at SAAT who is the Chief Financial Officer or who is at finance.  Then it is that person who can come if it is necessary for the commission.    To explain.    The danger – the danger Chair of putting a technical question to a person who does not have expert knowledge of that technical {speaking over one another].    But she has been saying this.    But Chairperson she has been saying I do not have the financial and if it is…    And my other concern Chairperson which I have.    I do not want to stress.    I have raised my concerns.    Why I think Ms Hofmeyr is not the person to ask this question.      The other second thing is if a person is asked a question a person should be asked a question which is within her knowledge.  This question is not in…    As it pleases Chair. 
ADV MBANJWA:   Thank you Chair.  Chair I just want to point out that the witness has said this line of questioning is unfair to her because she doesn’t not sit on the CFST ...[INTERVENES]      Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    All rise.
MS MBANJWA:   Thank you.       Thank you Chair.  The way I understand it, if a policy has been adopted, the adoption of the policy will be self-evident on the policy itself.  Or there will be a resolution to say such a policy is adopted. Adoption of a policy cannot be done by means [intervenes].     Thank you, Chair.     Slightly Chair, just to confirm quickly, I just want to know, because the statement is, the contract was detrimental to SAAT.  Are those detrimental aspects [intervenes].     Yes.  Yes.  Thank you Chair 
MS NONTSASA MEMELA:  Yes.  That is what I had explained Ms Hofmeyr yesterday that- and you actually even went back to that provision and said maybe that was the provision that I was talking about.  It is under some technical thing.  It talks about three months contract.  I said we were supposed to have according to the negotiations and stuff.  So, it is not like they paid this deposit upfront because I had responded to that email.  There were lots of processes Chair that were followed before the payment was made.   Even Dev Arya the CFO, the former CFO even explained that he had to push hard.  It is his email that I had read.  He had to push hard for things to be done and of course it is not paid from SAAT.  As you saw it had to go to the Group CFO of SAA, go through the Treasury of SAA who has to look at certain things.  So, I am not sure it was not my- it was not expected of me to be the one who say, okay pay.  Or maybe as you maybe that payment was made because I wrote that email.  I do not think so.    Ah-ha, I was not the person who advised on the contract and what it provided.  Chair because of my experience in terms of at contracts management once the contract is in place or maybe finance has an obligation to familiarise themselves of the provisions especially if they are lazy- I know when you are not a lawyer not really go through the whole contract or whatever.  Just go through the payment part or maybe wherever it talks about the deposit and whatever and know that this is what is expected from them.   For me I think Ms Hofmeyr she saw those emails with me writing and stuff and I did say the reason why I played that role was because my fear was that if we do not pay whatever we are expected to pay as per the contract, there will be an AOG (Aircraft on the Ground).  And once the aircraft is on the ground because of the lack of spares the first person who gets blamed is me.  And that is one thing that I always take accountability of you see where it comes to the what the provision of spares because that is the duty of procurement to provide spares to operation to run.      I do not accept.  Chair I said before Ms Kuki Mbeki came in, I held her position before I joined procurement so I was responsible for managing contracts and I was fully involved in there.  So ... (intervenes)    The position of Ms Mbeki, yes.      And then I do not know if you remember, I highlighted on Friday, Ms Hofmeyr I do not know if you remember about the structure that- the contract management at that time when I was in that position it was reporting to Commercial.  So, I reported the then GM Commercial Mr Arson Malola Phiri.  And then during the restructuring it was agreed to move to, ja.    Okay.  Yes Chair.    No.    I do not manage contracts.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Mm.    Okay.  Or do we go to that ... (intervenes)    Okay I do remember.  I remember there are lots of communications.    But I do remember I ... (intervenes)    Ja.    Mm.    Mm.    No.    Please read it.    Ja.    Ja.    Dukwana.    Ja.    Yes.    Mm-hmm.    Mm-hmm.    Ja, you do not have to go there.    Ja, you can ask your question.    Chair?    I am sure you heard Ms Hofmeyr reading an email form Mr Mario Dukwana.    Where he said; I am unable to positively wara wara and he said I have copied Advocate Nontsasa and Kuki Mbeki on this email.   And then that first paragraph it says; I am very surprised by your email.  Does this mean you have forgotten already who to communicate with? Lionel used to work for SAAT and he understands that contracts are managed by legal and contracts person.  Exactly so that is exactly what I was saying that he should have just what communicated with the legal and contract person who manages this contracts so that he can get a proper idea of what he was talked about instead of going on Google and talk about a roomer from the media instead of the facts that are there.   Ms Kuki Mbeki would have given him the facts.  Because already he was talking about an increase and when I asked in my email; please highlight where the increase is.  He could not because there were no facts.  He was just relying on the article on the media.    Yes, legal and contracts.    To me, yes.    Yes.    Yes, but my understanding of Ms Hofmeyr is that I managed the contract, go through them and have that contracts registered therefore I am the one who was managing contracts ... (intervenes)    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes, I was in charge for the unit that was responsible for contracts management ... (intervenes)    And other portfolios.    Okay repeat that Ms Hofmeyr.    Ja.    Mm-hmm.    Okay.  I still stand by my version Chair that how I wrote that email meant that we were expect or we were supposed to- I even read yesterday, we were supposed to have paid upfront and stuff.  And then I even mentioned the three months deposit which later was picked up in the contract by Ms Hofmeyr and stuff.  So, I am not agreeing to that.  I am still by my version.    Three months, ja    I accepted what the clause that was ready by Ms Hofmeyr ... (intervenes)    From the contract.    But I said the interpretation of my email to say finance was expected because now how it is put it is as if I instructed finance to pay cash or something so that is how ... (intervenes)    She is putting it.    But I am saying yesterday I accepted how it was written explaining the deposit.  And then she went on and read some when I asked if we could go back to the contract.  And there was indeed where it was mentioned the three months which confirmed what I had said in my email.    Where I said it was supposed to have been three months paid in advance or something.    Ja.    Ja.    Mm-hmm.    No Chair other than the deposit ... (intervenes)    Not.    Ja.    Yes.    It was security deposit.    It was the same deposit Chair.    Yes, in terms of the clause in the contract ... (intervenes)    Yes, it had stated down how it should be done.    Yes.    No Chair.    Okay they have happened after but I am just saying no to the link.    Oh okay.  Alright.    It was after, yes.    I was improperly in the position to influence them?    Had bought a land, yes.    Mm-hmm.    No Chair.    No Chair.  And we will explain that even better on our re-examination.    Sorry?    No there is no way where I had influenced the decision to award the contract to AAR and JM.  And there is no why where I had influenced the decision by any department at SAAT to pay AAR or JM.  So, I had said when I was- yesterday when I was talking that it seems that all of a sudden that I am outside SAAT everybody is now free to point things at Nontsasa because she is no longer there.   They- it goes as far as guys really denying the fact that they attended meetings because they know there is no camera that will prove that they attended meeting.  Executive members that are saying, okay Nontsasa, I asked for the contract from Nontsasa and Nontsasa said I do not have a copy I am protecting you.  And then there is Mr Schalk who has never seen me from a bar of soap ... (intervenes)    Mr Human who have never seen me from a bar of soap who is comfortably enough to come and sit here, talk about me because- so you end up not understanding what kind of role then did I play at SAAT.  It is as if I was even actually far more senior than the board.  If I did not know better Chair, I will say maybe unknowing to myself I was a Minister just giving- gooi in instructions and stuff.  I reported to people.  I was an HOD and I played my role to the best of my ability.   That is why I said earlier on if I had said here to answer that, okay my department based on the auditor general, these are the findings.  Because you did not ensure that your department ran according to the laws that are guiding the public procurement.  I will understand.  But where I have to answer on behalf of the Acting CEO like it was, I have that power to influence the Action CEO to influence the person who owned the GPUs who had a responsibility in terms of the PFMA to protect what he thought was not right to get sold.  And you understand the list goes on so no I did not have any influence.    Thank you Chair.    Yes.    I understand Chair. 
MS L MBANJWA:  Yes Chair, thank you I accept it will not be as agreed it will be as arranged.      There is just one request Chair we have if it is possible.  I have already raised it with Ms Hofmeyr.    And she did say that that document is not available.  But from our talks with Ms Hofmeyr she has said that there is an affidavit that is being prepared for Mr (indistinct Osini) that is the Acting CEO of SAAT.  Chair will remember that his role is that pivotal in so far as the pricing of the GPUs is concerned.  So, what we are then requesting from Ms Hofmeyr is if it can came- if it can come to pass that before we come back here that affidavit is finalised because she said it is being compiled.  Can we then please have sight of it because it will greatly assist in our re-examination?    Yes, I have.   Thank you.    Thank you Chair.
