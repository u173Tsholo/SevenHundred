CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    If you will be – she is trying to get me one of the files but I think we – we can start.  We can start Mr Pretorius.    One sec – one second Mr Pretorius.    Yes Mr Pretorius.    Do they – do they care to explain why if Mr Zuma thought that the fact that he intended to launch a review application against my decision not to recuse myself why they thought he should not put that before the Constitutional Court when the commission applied for an order to compel him to appear.    Well …   When the commission – when the commission launched an application – its application to the Constitutional Court Mr Zuma was served with a full set of papers    And his attorneys were given a courtesy copious as far as I recall from what I was told to say here is a full set of court papers that will be or will – or have been served upon your client.   Now in that application the point is made quite clearly that the commission was aware that Mr Zuma intended to launch a review application in regard to the recusal application and it was contended by the Secretary of the Commission that that would be no grounds for him not to appear before the commission it the meantime. So he and his lawyers knew that this was one of the points that was being made – that were being made by the commission before the Constitutional Court.  And if they contested that it was up to them to file papers in the Constitutional Court and say the commission is wrong. The position is that as far as we are concerned if there is review application we are still intending to file in the High Court the Constitutional Court should not order our client to appear.  Mr Zuma chose not to oppose that application notwithstanding the fact that he knew that that was one of the points that the commission was going to make before the Constitutional Court.    He – he and his lawyers sent a letter to say he would not participate in those proceedings at all.  The question is can he complain about the order made by the Constitutional Court in circumstances where he was given a full opportunity to oppose that application and place before the court his case and elect and he elected not to do so.    If Mr Zuma or his lawyers were of the view that the summons was irregular the law obliged him if he wanted not to be obliged to appear to approach a court and ask that it be set aside on the basis that it was irregular. And I do not know the law to be that he is an adult to just ignore a summons just because he thinks it’s irregular.    And I think that the principle you have articulated is the same principle that the Constitutional Court told him about in the Nkandla matter.  That you cannot just ignore a process issued by a lawful body requiring you to take certain action and just because you think it is wrong you just sit back and ignore it.    Have you got the media statement that he issued on the 1 s t of February?  Have you got it at hand?    You have not got it.  You see the letter from his attorneys this morning says in the last paragraph that in effect his non-appearance should not be constituted to suggest any defiance of the legal process.  But my recollection of his media statement of the 1 s t of February is that in his own words he said he was going to defy.    The summons of the commission and he was going to defy an order of the – the order of the Constitutional Court.  Those were his words.  The media statement was not issued by his foundation it appears to have been issued by him; himself.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Well we – we – the commission is interested in what reasons have been given insofar as they have been given for his non-appearance and that media statement seems to make it clear that he was – he had decided to defy.    The summons, to defy the order of the Constitutional Court and of course …    That is – and the law and that seems consistent with his conduct before this commission on the 19 t h of November when he had been issued with a summons; he came to the proceedings and left at a time when it had been made clear to him and his lawyers that to leave the commission without the Chairperson’s permission would be a breach of the summons and a breach of the commission. His foundation it is in the public domain issues a media statement on the same day saying it had been assured by him that he would have a good day than appear before the commission. So the media statement that he issued on the 1 s t of February after the Constitutional Court issued – have handed down its judgment and ordered him to appear before the commission and to comply with all summonses and directives issued by the commission. The statement of – that he gave is consistent with the Jacob Zuma Foundation’s media statement of the 19 t h of November 2020.    And in the founding affidavit deposed to by the Secretary of the Commission in the application that was made to the Constitutional Court one of the points was not – that was made was that reference was made to the contents of that statement by the Jacob Zuma Foundation of saying he was going to – he was not prepared to appear before the commission and he would rather go to jail. And he that is Mr Zuma was invited to distance himself from that statement by his foundation; he has never distanced himself.  Instead in his media statement of the 1 s t of February he confirmed that he was going to defy not only the summons of the commission but also an order of the highest court in this country.    Yes continue.    Yes.    Yes.    I think that is – that is important because it is important that everybody understands at least the important features of what has happened.    And how we have come to be where we are.    And also it is difficult to understand why he would be scared of taking the witness stand and subjecting himself to questioning like everybody else.   By the evidence leaders and the Chairperson.    Well in – in talking about the duty to assist if I recall correctly paragraph 3 of the Terms of Reference of the commission which were signed by him while he was President in paragraph 3 of the Terms of Reference he said all organs of state will be required to cooperate fully with the commission.    One would have thought that he would be the first one to cooperate fully with the commission.    Hm.       You said Mr Gigaba.  Well, I have not heard him yet.     Ja.     Yes, there is evidence ...[intervenes]      ...media allegations.     And ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Well, strictly speaking, where evidence has already been given, it is really more than allegations.  It is evidence.       It is evidence now.  It has been given under oath and some of those witnesses have subjected themselves to questioning on their evidence.  So it is evidence that has been placed before the Commission.  It is no longer just mere allegations that are made in the streets.     Ja.     H’m.     Ja.     We can take the adjournment, tea adjournment, now or if you prefer we can – you can – we can go on, let you finish and then we take the adjournment.  Maybe we should take it now?     Okay, alright.  We will take the tea adjournment now, it is nearly twenty five to twelve.  We will resume at ten to twelve.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     You may continue Mr Pretorius.     Your voice is dropping, I don’t know whether it is because – maybe the aircon is too high.     Do your best.   Ja, but I think the aircon the noise is just too high, so if somebody can turn it down a little bit, even if not turn it off.   Okay.     Well you were mentioning earlier on about – you were mentioning the stance taken by Mr Zuma, you might not have referred to him by name, in regard to the whole issue of State Capture that he was saying well nobody says Parliament was captured, or the judiciary was captured, but one wonders within the context of our electoral system and the ...[indistinct] representation system or maybe irrespective of that, whether those who may have pursued the agenda of State Capture could have said well if you capture the head of State, if you capture the President you know that he is also the President of the ruling party and if he is powerful in the ruling party then members of the ruling party in Parliament might make sure that – the party might instruct them not to pursue certain matters, and therefore if you capture the President of a country indirectly you can render even Parliament – you can ensure that Parliament does not investigate matters that it should investigate and I heard evidence about proposals or requests that were made that the Guptas be investigated and the committee did not do that. We also – I also heard evidence how despite the fact that the SIU had conducted a certain investigation into BOSASA and had presented to the Correctional Services Committee, Portfolio Committee a report that members of that committee itself found to reveal – I can’t remember the adjective they used or the Chairperson of the Commission used to describe how horrific they found its way in terms of the conduct but nevertheless nothing was done by Parliament itself, by the committee itself to stop what was happening at Correctional Services, between Correctional Services and BOSASA.     Yes, yes, and one should recall that early in 2019 I announced publically that I had a meeting with the current President and I had indicated that this Commission could not be said to have properly completed its job without the executive, members of the executive who served under Mr Zuma, including him because he was the Deputy President, coming to the Commission and saying what they know and dealing with questions that the Commission will have, and I said the ruling party too this Commission cannot be said to have properly completed its job without the ruling party also coming before the Commission and say what it knew, when did it become aware of certain things, what steps did it take to deal with those matters, or allegations of State Capture, and this is important because the party is the one that goes to the voters and say vote for us, and obviously usually there is already somebody that they present to save you if you vote for us in sufficient numbers and we have the majority this will be the President.    Now the ruling party having heard evidence that has been led in this Commission, having become aware of a lot of things that we have had relating to allegation of State Capture and corruption during Mr Zuma’s presidency, they ought to come to the Commission to say what do they have to say about the fact that they were the ruling party at the time and this was somebody they presented to the voters to say this will be the President, and of course there are other matters in relation to them being the ruling party.  They need to come now – I mentioned that publicly early in 19 that I have mentioned it to the current president and he had not hesitated to say he would lead the government delegation to come and give evidence to the Commission.       He has never changed from that position and it is the question of the Commission establishing the dates for that but he also told me that the ruling party, the ANC, also agreed that it would come and give evidence before the Commission.     So they have indicated that and arrangements will be made for that.     Yes, exactly.     Exactly, yes.     We are at twenty five to one.  You are done.  I am thinking that whether we should – I should say something now or until we finish or whether we should rather take the lunch break and we come back at two, so before I announce what the Commission is going to do about what has happened.  Have you got suggestions? ADV PRETORIUS     Ja.     No, we are very clear about what needs to be done.  There is no confusion about what should be done, our law is not deficient in this respect at all but it might be appropriate to adjourn and then come back at two and then I will make my remarks about some of the matters that have been raised and then announce what the Commission – what next the Commission will do.     Ja, at two.     We are going to adjourn and we will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     I am not delivering a judgment or a ruling because there is no ruling that I need to make but I do need to indicate what is to happen as far as the commission is concerned in the light of these latest developments involving Mr Jacob Zuma.   In terms of a summons that was issued by the Secretary of the Commission Mr Zuma was supposed to appear before the commission from today up to Friday to give evidence and to be questioned on various matters which have been investigated and are still being investigated by the commission.  Some of which were indicated by Mr Pretorius in his address to me this morning. Because Mr Zuma had previously walked out of the commission or fled the commission when he was supposed to take the witness stand on the 19 t h of November 2020 even though he knew that he had been served with a summons to appear before the commission and to give evidence and be questioned and to remain in attendance until excused by the Chairperson he had walked out without permission and had not offered any explanation for his conduct to the commission. The commission feared that he would not comply with any further summons that could be issued against him by the commission and for that reason the commission applied – lodged an application to the Constitutional Court in the Constitutional Court for various orders but mainly for orders that would compel Mr Zuma to comply with the summons issued by the commission and appear before the commission and answer questions that would be put to him and to remain in attendance and not leave without permission – without the permission of the Chairperson of the commission. When the commission launched its application it served Mr Zuma with a copy of the papers and he was informed in those papers that if he wanted to oppose the application in other words if he did not want the Constitutional Court to grant the orders that the commission was asking for he should file – he should indicate his intention to oppose and file before – in the Constitutional Court affidavits where he would set out his case and state why the Constitutional Court should not make an order compelling him to appear before the commission. In the affidavit of the Secretary of the Commission one of the points that was made quite clear which Mr Zuma and his lawyers would have seen is that it was going to be argued before the Constitutional Court that the fact that Mr Zuma was going to be pursuing a review application in the High Court to have my decision not to recuse myself reviewed and set aside by the High Court would not in law be a ground to justify him not appearing before the commission or not complying with the summons.  That issue was placed in the papers.  Mr Zuma and his lawyers would have seen that and it was up to Mr Zuma and his lawyers if they thought that that was not correct in law or that that was wrong to have participated in the proceedings in the Constitutional Court and to have placed their argument that the fact that he was in – going to pursue a review application was a ground for him not to comply with the summons and not to appear before the commission. They knew that that point was to be argued.  They knew exactly what the commission would argue.  They chose not to contest that in the Constitutional Court.  They chose not to participate in those proceedings. One of the points also that was made in their founding affidavit deposed to by the Secretary of the Commission in that application to the Constitutional Court was the point that no witness before this commission including Mr Zuma has a right to remain silent once they take the witness back. The commission raised this issue because when Mr Zuma’s counsel presented his argument in support of the recusal application on the 16t h of November 2020 his counsel at some stage said that he could put Mr Zuma on the witness stand and ask him to say nothing. So the commission realised that there seemed to be a view on the part of Mr Zuma’s lawyers that a witness before this commission has a right to remain silent after taking the witness stand.   So the commission raised this issue in the papers before the Constitutional Court and made it clear that it was going to argue that there is no such right in proceedings before the commission.  And that such a right belongs to an accused person in criminal proceedings not in this commission. So when Mr Zuma and his lawyers were served with the papers that the commission lodged in the Constitutional Court they knew that this is what – this is part of what the commission would argue before the Constitutional Court. What the commission said was that the only part which they could indicate is that the privilege against self-incrimination is available in appropriate circumstances to a witness who appears before the commission and that as far as Mr Zuma is concerned that privilege would apply to him as well but not the right to remain silent. When therefore Mr Zuma and his lawyers decided that they were not going to oppose the commission’s application to the Constitutional Court and that Mr Zuma was not going to participate in those proceedings they knew that this was one of the issues that were going to be raised and if they believed that they had a case to the contrary it was up to them to place their arguments before the Constitutional Court to enable the Constitutional Court to find in their favour if they were able to persuade the Constitutional Court.  They chose not to do so either. Mr Zuma had a full opportunity to put whatever reasons he believed to put before the Constitutional Court whatever reasons he believed justified him in not complying with the summons for him not appearing before the commission and allowed the Constitutional Court to decide whether those reasons were sound or not.  He chose not to do any of them. He was free to also say to the Constitutional Court you cannot compel me to appear before this Chairperson of this commission because of the following reasons if he thought that his reasons were sound and would be regarded as acceptable by the Constitutional Court. It is not clear why if he thought he had good reasons why he should not be compelled to appear before the commission why he chose not to put those reasons before the commission – before the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court handed down its judgment and made an order that he should appear before the commission.  It made it clear that he has no right to remain silent once he takes the witness stand.   In doing so the Constitutional Court did not take away any rights that Mr Zuma may have had because even before the judgment of the Constitutional Court he did not have the right to remain silent in these proceedings.  Actually those who follow the proceedings of the commission closely may remember that early in November I think on the 6t h of November in the – or on the occasion when Ms Dudu Myeni appeared before the commission the evidence leader Ms Kate Hofmeyr addressed the question of the right to remain silent and the issue of the privilege against self-incrimination.   In that address which can be accessed by anybody who would like to access it in the transcripts she made it clear that as far as the evidence leaders are concerned there is no right to remain silent.  There was only the privilege against self-incrimination and indeed she referred to cases – to case law that is with the issue of privilege against self-incrimination by our courts and in this regard the re – she referred to a judgment of the Appellate Division in Magmoed which – or Magmoed versus Janse Van Rensburg and Others 1993 Volume 1 SA777 A for Appellate Division which dealt with that issue. In that case too as long ago as that time the Appellate Division had made it clear that the privilege against refusal to give evidence on the strength of the privilege against self-incrimination is not there for the taking and that there must be reasonable grounds for an apprehension that the witness may incriminate himself or herself. That the Constitutional Court also said so it is not something that really had not been there before.  There might be one or two aspects that were emphasised or added by the Constitutional Court but that the – there must be reasonable grounds before the privilege can be evoked had been dealt with by our courts before. In fact either on the last day when Ms Myeni gave evidence or towards the end of her evidence I specifically dealt or requested the legal team and it is in the transcript that they should carefully go through Ms Myeni’s evidence to see whether all the questions that she refused to answer on the basis of a privilege whether there were reasonable grounds of that. So I – in effect I did not make a ruling – any final ruling that she had correctly invoked it.  I allowed that the legal team should go through the transcript carefully and then where they believe that there are no reasonable grounds she can be called back and she can – that issue can be dealt with.  Ms Myeni has not dealt with certain issues relating to Eskom and she is supposed to come back and when she comes back you can – once the legal team has carefully gone through her evidence and all the questions she refused to answer she can be asked questions about the existence or non-existence of reasonable grounds for her apprehension that she would not incriminate herself if she answered certain questions. Do I repeat my request to the legal team to please go through that evidence and come to a – take a view so that it can be dealt with properly? So with regard to Mr Zuma the law would be the same that would apply to his evidence.  The Constitutional Court has not taken away any rights of his as far as that privilege – the privilege against self-incrimination is concerned. It is a pity that Mr Zuma has decided not to appear before the commission today.  In defiance of the summons issued by the commission and in defiance of the order of the Constitutional Court our highest court in the land. It would be a pity if anybody did it but that it was – this was done by a former President of the Republic someone who twice stood before the nation and took an oath that he would uphold the constitution of the Republic and protect it is a great pity. The commission did not just rush to issuing summonses against Mr Zuma to compel him to appear before it.  The commission did not just rush to the Constitutional Court to get an order to compel Mr Zuma to appear before it.  The commission did so when it was clear that he really was not prepared to comply with the summons. And the Constitutional Court has made it clear in its judgment that a witness who has been summoned to appear before the commission is not supposed just to come to be present here.  He or she must come to testify and answer questions and that he or she may not leave before the proceedings are completed or before he or she is excused by the Chairperson. On the 19t h of November Mr Zuma left the proceedings of the commission before they were completed and without permission from the Chairperson even though a few minutes before he left he had been reminded by Mr Pretorius that it was not up to him to just up and go. An order of any court is binding on those to whom it applies.  A summons to also binding on the person to whom it is directed and if a person has been issued with a summons – has been served with the a summons to appear in court or in any forum or tribunal and he and she thinks that the summons should not have been issued or the summons is irregular it is not up to that person to just ignore the summons or to defy it. His or her obligation is to approach the courts and tell the courts why he or she says the summons should not have been issued or why he says the summons is irregular and should be set aside. And only if he or she succeeds in getting the court to set the summons aside is he or she entitled not to appear.  But as long as the summons has not been set aside it is valid and binding on the person and he or she must comply with the summons. That principle was stated by the Constitutional Court in the context of the Public Protector’s Remedial action in the Nklandla matter and Mr Zuma should know that principle.   In this case he has decided to ignore the summonses issued by the commission and not to go to court to have them set aside if he thought they were invalid or they were irregular but to just ignore them as if they do not exist. First he walked out of the commission proceedings on the 19 t h of November. Second despite having been served with a summons to appear before the commission in the week beginning on the 18t h January 2021 he decided to not – not to appear even after he had been reminded by the commission that the fact that the judgment of the Constitutional Court had not been given did not mean that the summons had been suspended or set aside and that he should appear he decided not to appear. He has done the same thing again. This is very serious because if it is allowed to prevail there will lawlessness and chaos in the courts.  Because there may be other who will decide to follow his example when they are served with summonses and other court processes and decide that they can ignore them.  Summonses and subpoenas get issued in our courts every    We are going to adjourn the proceedings.  There will be no proceedings tomorrow.  If the commission is able to make arrangements to bring some witnesses and make use of some of the days this week it will announce but this whole week has been set aside for the hearing of Mr Zuma’s evidence and he is not here – he will not be here the rest of the week. We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Thank you Chair.  This morning Mabusa Attorneys representing the former President Mr Zuma addressed a letter to the commission who informed the commission that quote “as a matter of courtesy” unquote our client will not be appearing before the commission on 15 to 19 February 2021 for the reasons set out below. Two reasons are given.  The first is that there is a…    Two reasons are given the first is    Well they say in paragraph 6 that that review application was not before the Constitutional Court.  It was not before the Constitutional Court in the sense the Constitutional Court was not asked to decide that application but certainly they are incorrect insofar as they suggest that that application was not properly pleaded and was not put before the Constitutional Court and they were aware of it.  So there is no explanation given beyond the bare statement.  But that is a matter that the Constitutional Court will no doubt decide on the face of it it has not merit whatsoever but what is not correct in the approach of the former President is that he should come here and express a lawful reason why he should not apply the law or attend in accordance with the summons.    Or set the summons aside prior to.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes Chair. Chair the – we could use much stronger language but perhaps that would be appropriate – more appropriate in time but the failure to appear today does not appear to be justified by any valid reasons certainly not the reasons given in the letter addressed to the commission as a matter of courtesy this morning. Firstly the review application matter was before the Constitutional Court. It was raised in pleadings before the Constitutional Court and notwithstanding the Constitutional Court’s awareness of it and notwithstanding Mr Zuma’s failure to address the issues at all the order was given that he must appear. In relation to the summons not being a valid summons well that Mr Zuma was free to come here and say today but chose not to and as we know such a summons must as a matter of law be valid until set aside by a proper court.  People cannot just form their own views as to what the law might or might not say and decide what to do in the face of a validly issued summons or even a summons which on the face of it is validly issued. That is valid until set aside.  And there is not basis whatsoever for the certainly expressed day for the President not to be here today.    Correct.    Yes.  In any event Chair two points only to be made from what is or what appears to be in the public domain the real reasons for non-appearance are not expressed in that letter and they are matters that are perhaps beyond the realm of this commission.   This commission has a mandated job to do it must do it. The implications and consequences of this commission doing its job is for those who will receive the report ultimately to decide. The second point is that whatever merits there might be and we do not see any in the reasons not to appear today will no doubt in due course be decided by our courts once again.    Yes we can get it.    Yes.    Yes.  Chair in fact the statement it is a long statement but…hair in fact the statement it is a long statement but…    If we could just place on record certain paragraphs.    Of his statement.  He says  “I therefore state in advance that the commission into allegations of state capture can expect no further cooperation from me in any of their process going forward.  If this stance is considered to be a violation of their law then let their law take its course.  I do not fear being arrested; I do not fear being convicted nor do I fear being incarcerated.”    That is to put it at its mildness – mildest this statement of defiance. But once again Chair it does appear that the true reasons for not appearing are beyond these strict Terms of Reference which we must investigate and they are of a political nature.    Yes.    The law.    Yes Chair.    Chair in summary the reasons for non-appearance couched in courteous and polite language in this morning’s letter from Mabusa Attorneys do not seem to hold any water and are groundless.  But those comments there in particular the comment that nothing should be construed goes to suggest any defiance of a legal process must be read in the light of the statements to which we have just referred. And in part – well particular concern is the reference to their law.  In other words not a law by which I will be bound but a law that will bind others and if there is any active defiance it is contained in those two words.    Chair the legal team has prepared an address to deal with the very circumstances that are – have now arisen and if I could take half an hour or so.    To just inform the Chair and the public of the types of issues that would have been raised.    Had Mr Zuma elected to obey…    Yes.    So what this address will deal with is really the evidence before the commission and what issues would have been placed before Mr Zuma for his response or input in order to assist you to come to findings in accordance with your mandate and your Terms of Reference Chair. We do not intend to deal with the legalities of the non-appearance and the consequences of Mr Zuma’s failure to appear as a matter of law. In short Chair the commission has not been deprived of its opportunity to question the former President in regard to his knowledge of and his conduct relevant to the commission’s Terms of Reference which I will detail in a moment. But by way of summary where we find ourselves now is that we have Terms Of Reference a mandate to you Chair and to the commission as a whole Mr Zuma has is referred to directly by name in four Terms of Reference and indirectly in two as part of the Executive or at least two. His evidence is obviously relevant to the commission’s work in this regard.   There can be no doubt about that.   Mr Zuma has also been implicated to date by the evidence of at least 40 witnesses now.  Now whether Mr Zuma believes he has been accused of wrongdoing or not which appears to be the case his responses to those allegations are still directly relevant to the work of this commission. Numerous statements have been made by or on behalf of Mr Zuma that he has not been implicated in any wrongdoing by any of the witnesses that have thus far come before you Chair.   If that is so – if it is so that Mr Zuma believes he has not been implicated of any wrongdoing or accused of any wrongdoing by any evidence before you Chair then it is difficult to understand why he would need to rely on a right to silence.    Correct.    And still less Chair would Mr Zuma need to rely on any right against self-incrimination if on his version there is no evidence which indeed incriminates.  So the alleged interference with his constitutional rights seems on his own version to be entirely groundless.   Be that as it may what happened during the Presidency of Mr Zuma and during the period under review the details of what he did; the details of what he did not do and importantly his knowledge of the relevant events whether direct knowledge or indirect knowledge are important for the work of this commission. Moreover he was not only during much of the period under review not necessarily all of the period under review President he was Chair of Cabinet.  Cabinet made important – Cabinet on the face of it failed to take importance of this issue. The exercise of his responsibility in these capacities are important to the work of the commission. Finally Mr Zuma and members of his family are alleged to have received substantial monetary and other benefits from private and state sources.  These also require a response and an explanation. In short Chair Mr Zuma perhaps more than anyone else is able to assist the commission in understanding what happened in the period under review; how it happened and what recommendations the commission could make in relation to its findings. But clearly this is assistance is not forthcoming.  This is not attack it is a calling to account and a calling for assistance and information to enable you Chair to – to fulfil your mandate. The Constitutional Court made a finding in December Chair said or January. “It must be plainly stated that the allegations investigated by the commission are extremely serious.  If established they would constitute a huge threat to our nascent and fledgling democracy.  It is in the interests of all South Africans the respondent included that is Mr Zuma that these allegations are put to rest once and all.  It is only the commission which may determine if there is any credence in them or to clear the names of those implicated from culpability.” There are two aspects to a commission of inquiry certainly in these circumstances Chair. The first is to investigate its Terms of Reference.  To hear evidence in relation to its Terms of Reference and to make findings and recommendations in relation to that. But t is also there – there as a matter of public concern and this was stressed by the Constitutional Court.  The public have a right to know what happened.  The public have a right to know what their President did or did not do.  The public have a right to know what their President says about this.  Not in the streets outside residences in KwaZulu Natal but here in this commission. So the duty to assist the commission there is not only a legal duty arising from the summons issued by the commission but the narrow legal issue which is before you Chair.  It is a cross..    That is correct.    Yes.  Well at the time too he made a public statement announcing the establishment of the commission and urging all South Africans to cooperate fully and that clip is in the media.    Apart from the duty to obey the summons; apart from the duty to abide by regulations, Terms of Reference and the like there is a constitutional duty there arising from the position that Mr Zuma held as President of the country. It is also a public duty owed to the citizens of this country.  Manifestly this commission’s work is a matter of public concern. So Chair whatever the politicians and commentators might have to say about the commission’s work it remains our duty to fulfil the mandate that you have given in accordance with your Terms of Reference and it is these Terms of Reference that guide its work.  We simply have to do our duty so whatever the noise out there Chair we – yourself as the sitting Justice and ourselves as evidence leaders and the investigators we have a mandate it is a legal mandate and we must obey that mandate and that is our duty – then we must fulfil it. The legal consequences of Mr Zuma’s failure to appear will no doubt be dealt with separately and perhaps Chair we can – you will deal with those in due course. But I would appreciate Chair and have been requested by yourself to inform yourself the commission and the public of the issues the legal team intended this week and perhaps an additional time to raise with Mr Zuma. Chair there is a need for a caveat however it seems that many do not understand really how the commission goes about this.  But here is evidence.  It does not tell people what to say of – it may highlight topics that need to be covered but ultimately the witnesses come here to give their evidence. That evidence can be contested by other witnesses in the fullness of time and when you do your report Chair you will decide who is telling the truth and who is not telling the truth and we can assist you in that regard. But the allegations that we will outline now in this address Chair are based on evidence presented as well as evidence still to be presented; allegations which have emerged and investigations, statements which have been taken. The correctness or the veracity of that evidence will only finally get examined after you Chair have considered all the relevant versions received in respect of the evidence including what we thought might be the version of Mr Zuma. Some of the allegations as I have said that will be referred to have not yet been led in evidence but Mr Zuma has been notified of such allegations in voluminous correspondence and his attorneys.  All those allegations would in the ordinary course be the subject matter of notification to Mr Zuma before being questioned thereon at a later state. So even if this week we were constrained to deal with certain issues in relation to which Mr Zuma had already been received information and be notified. In later – at a later time, he would have to answer other questions or be asked to answer other questions in relation to allegations that are the subject matter of the Commission’s investigations. Chair, but the essential thrust of the questioning and discussions with Mr Zuma this week is based on the ultimate question really that the Legal Team would like to assist this Commission to answer. In August 2018, the Legal Team made an opening presentation to the Commission and in that opening presentation it was emphasised that State Capture is not just about corruption. The mandate to enquire as to what is State Capture and whether State Capture was a project which was perpetrated by whomever might have been implicated in the evidence.  It is a question that is yet to be answered. The work of this Commission is not even about widespread corruption.  Corruption itself may be a part of a project of State Capture or an alleged project of State Capture but it is - State Capture is more than that. State Capture, and this was in the opening statement in 2018, at least in theory would concern a network of relationship both inside and outside government whose objective would be to ensure the repurposing of government departments, officials and state-owned entities for private and unlawful... In other words, when one puts together all the elements, the evidence that you have heard, the question     Yes.     Well, there are allegations ...[intervenes]      ...that have been put to him.     Yes.     There are allegations that he would answer in this realm.     As I said in the beginning this includes evidence already led and to be led on the understanding that before been called to answer, he would have been informed of it for a later appearance. Chair, in relation to the appointments and dismissals of ministers; now this is just one piece of the jigsaw, what flowed from the appointments and dismissals of ministers, I will deal with in due course but that is the starting point in the centre of the jigsaw puzzle Chair. The evidence has been that the Gupta’s had in some cases prior knowledge of executive appointments and dismissals in our Terms of Reference specifically... The Gupta sought to influence executive appointments on occasion through bribery or attempted bribery.  The Gupta sought to gain business advantage from relationship with and access to ministers and I will come to the detail in a moment.  That is at a general level. What is also clear, and that is the next step in the puzzle, the Gupta’s and Gupta related entities ultimately benefited substantially from manifestly corrupt or irregular procurement deals.  That is the evidence.  Those are the allegations made before you.  You will make a finding on the correctness of those allegations and in due course. And this followed what may be termed a new level of repurposing, not at executive level but at the level state-owned entities. And the allegation that would have been put to Mr Zuma is that by reorganising or repurposing state-owned entities, principle who appointments and dismissals in relation to which, at least in some cases, Mr Zuma’s involvement was direct. That as arranged to redirect state resources into hands of select individuals and entities including Gupta entities.  And these beneficiaries included members of Mr Zuma’s family.  So the allegation goes and I stress this, the allegations.  Principle Mr Duduzane Zuma. So Chair there is substantial evidence requiring an answer before you make your final decision and I stress that once again that we are dealing here with allegations that are before this Commission that must be dealt with in the fullness of time. Mr Zuma involved himself ...[intervenes]      Chair but ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Well, perhaps it would be fair to say that in the course of evidence under oath before you.     It has been tested to an extent.     Certain allegations have been made which require an answer.     At the end of the Commission’s work insofar as the leading of evidence is concerned, whether in oral or documentary form, you will then determine the outcome Chair. So there is substantial evidence.  Chair, I will detail that in a moment.  That Mr Zuma’s involvement directly in the affairs of state-owned entities.   Executive appointments were follows and the executive – I am talking of Cabinet appointments – were followed by appointments of amongst others board of and senior executives in state-owned entities and this happened by way of example, Eskom, Transnet, Denel, PRASA, SAA.  All that evidence is before you Chair. The consequence.  What happened then in time is that there has been evidence of vast acts of corruption which took massive resources out of those state entities and placed them in the hands of those very entities and persons who influenced this whole process...     Yes, Chair, okay.     Social media pointed that out to me in the break, and it has been reported, so it is a habit that I have built up for over 40 years it is difficult to break, I apologise.     So we have the contemplated prosecutions of Generals Dramat, Shadrick, Sibiya, those were persons investigating the Mdluli case, the Nkandla case, the Panday case, there are a range of examples but they fall under two heads Chair.  Quite apart from the inaction and the failure to act, which itself is an important issue that needs to be canvassed, not only with Mr Zuma but with others too.   The prosecution of persons intent on combating corruption, a range of examples under that head, and secondly the protection of politically connected individuals from the law.  Those two happened in tandem, they were positive acts on the part of law enforcement agencies.  So law enforcement agencies were not asleep, they were entirely active, they had in charge of them persons appointed by Mr Zuma.  So it is not enough to say this happened by default Chair, an active finance capacitated series of law enforcement agencies, not one, allowing this to happen under its watch. Again it is difficult to conclude that this was just yet another coincidence in the chain of events that is the subject matter of our terms of reference Chair and the evidence led before you, and it is something that needs to be explained by persons who were in charge. Then Chair with regard to the Intelligence Agencies you heard substantial evidence, there was evidence previously from Messrs Shaik, Njenje and Magathuka in relation to the reorganisation of the State Security Agencies under Mr Zuma’s watch. He issued a proclamation creating the amalgamation of which – of State Security Agencies under one director general about which you have heard evidence and the findings of the Mfumadi panel are stark, if I may just quote this something again that would be for the former President.  This panel of experts thereafter serious investigation and deliberation     Yes.   There is no doubt – well perhaps one should not put it that strongly, but there has been fair and convincing evidence that the Gupta family at the very least, let alone those in charge of the BOSASA and other institutions sought directly to influence or even exercise a degree of control over the former President, that evidence is there.  The degree to which he can explain the apparent cooperation that was lent to those efforts through appointments and dismissals, non-prosecutions, prosecutions and the like, the SSA evidence to the effect that the SSA investigation into the Gupta influence was shut down, that evidence all requires explanation but there is just one point that needs to be made and that is that this would not have been possible it may be only through the influence of one person, but there are others too that perhaps should be called to account in that regard, and that is another issue that needs to be dealt with.     Yes.     Yes.     There has been plenty of evidence to answer the first question that you pose frequently, Chair, and that is what happened but the question that needs to be answer in relation to what you have just said, could it happen.     How could this happen?     Chair, the picture that has been painted thus far is not the end of the story and I will summarise what other elements there are to – the regulatory framework, the banks attempting to close bank accounts because of what were perceived to be dealings fraught with risk and other questions arising over them, why would parliament – or not, sorry, why would the cabinet, why would the task team interfere with it?  Those are questions that need to be answered.  Another question, the Financial Intelligence Centre, these illicit dealings somehow ought to have been picked up earlier.  Why were they not picked up?  The Financial Intelligence Centre, the evidence has been, gave plenty of information through to law enforcement agencies, that was not acted upon.   But importantly, in the light of evidence that has been given in the last two weeks about the role of the State Security Agency, there was an attempt to delay the passing of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act which would have strengthened the activities of the – the capacity and activities of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act but there was also a proposal that would be put to Mr Zuma that the Financial Intelligence Centre should be moved away from Treasury’s jurisdiction into the security cluster.  Now the significance of that on its own is one thing but seen in the light of all the other evidence, it is significant and it is something that requires answer. And then, Chair, the importance of what the legal team has termed the narrative, an informed electorate is essential to the operation of the democracy that our constitution seeks to establish and protect and to the extent that news or information is distorted, to the extent that population is misled as to what really is occurring, to that extent the fundamental aspects of our electoral democracy may be undermined. So serious questions arise as to the attempts to influence the media, attempts to establish alternative and sympathetic media using state funds, all that evidence has been before you with relation to the New Age newspaper, ANN7, the activities of the former President in attempting to deal with editorial policy in relation to ANN7 and their New – Sundaram’s evidence you will have recalled.  That whole conspectus of evidence needs to be put into the picture because the components of what might be alleged to be the state capture project would be incomplete if it did not have its public relations arm and there is evidence that indeed it did have a public relations arm ranging from attempts to influence media, to obtain what is euphemistically called positive news as opposed to negative news or critical news, to the involvement of Bell Pottinger in its campaign.  All that evidence too will in due course be collated and put before you but it is an important part of the big picture. So, Chair, there is more detail particularly in relation to the lack of accountability that appears to have been a concomitant series of events accompanying everything that you have heard over the last three years. In summary, and I am not going to go through them all because of far beyond my allotted time, and the evidence will come to the fore in due course, but the question of accountability or the lack of accountability, the lack of detection, action and accountability is central to the question as to whether this was just a coincidental series of events from beginning to end or whether it was the – the outcome was intended and planned as part of what might be termed – you will in due course decide what is state capture and whether the evidence points to that conclusion. Chair, when all the evidence before you, including evidence led and evidence still to come, is considered, at least provisionally certain conclusions need to be tested if not made and those conclusions, provisional conclusions, questions even need – or have needed to be put to the captain of the ship, the person at the wheel, during the period under review, even if they are not final findings, provisional, question asked.   The various appointments and dismissals of ministers, state officials, SOE board and executives had consequences such as the corrupt appropriation of state resources on a massive scale.  Were those consequences coincidental or were they intended consequences?  Among the beneficiaries of the alleged corruption were the very persons who influenced or attempted to influence the course of action right from the very beginning with the National Executive cabinet appointments and dismissal. Vast amounts of state funds then flowed to a network of individuals and entities some of whom were associated with the very persons who sought to influence the project or alleged project in the first case.  Was this coincidental or planned?   No responsible state entity, parliament, at least for a time, law enforcement agencies, Chapter 9 institutions, at least for a time until the Public Protector report, were able to, were allowed to or did detect and put a stop to this pattern of contact(?) and its various component parts.   On the contrary, oversight and law enforcement mechanisms appear and the allegations are that they were deliberately harnessed to support the project or at least to prevent it being halted.  All this was accompanied by public narrative or an attempted public narrative which attempted to defend and justify what was occurring and to undermine those who opposed it.  Chair, this Commission has been the victim of that narrative as well but that is something for another day. Other elements of our society colluded or appeared to collude or are alleged to have colluded in the success of what might be termed a project or enterprise.   The auditors profession, elements of the legal profession, was such collusion merely passive?  Was it a failure to act or ought other elements of our society have been called to account in the overall scheme of the evidence that has presented? And in the end, Chair, Mr Zuma through – and I stress, honest cooperation, might have assisted the Commission to understand fully not only what happened but how it could have happened, Chair.     Although, Chair, on the other hand, the consequences seem to be fairly clear.     At two, Chair?     Thank you.    Noted thank you Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS:   Thank you Chair.  Chair just to summarise we have evidence, and you have heard evidence led before you of attempts of particular networks of individuals and entities to influence appointments and dismissals at the highest level.   Both decisions ultimately were made by Mr Zuma in the period under review.    That then filtered down to appointments and dismissals and reorganisation of State Owned Entities and government departments. The benefits from illegal unlawful illicit dealings that occurred during that period was a consequence of that period and I have dealt with is that coincidence or was that intended come back to the very source where the influence was sought to be originated in the first place, but the question then arises Chair where were the defenders of our legal order whilst this was all happening, where was Parliament in its oversight role, where were the various oversight bodies, we know that the Public Protector intervened eventually, but very late, and where in particular were the law enforcement agency and the question arises were those law enforcement agencies deliberately disabled, deliberately influenced to allow this project, if it was a project, to continue to its logical outcome, to fruition, or is there some other reason why what happened within the sphere of law enforcement agencies, in relation to the evidence that you have been given Chair to explain it, and that must be explained Chair and there are many who can explain, but Mr Zuma is one who could assist you in coming to a conclusion in that regard. The evidence is reasonably overwhelming Chair, you can make a finding, but to get a complete picture one needs the complete evidence.  The most stark example is the BOSASA example, I have dealt with it, the investigation, rampant corruption, SIU investigation, dormant for almost a decade, and we know that certain key individuals appointed directly, or indirectly by Mr Zuma or persons acting under Mr Zuma, to interfere with that prosecution.   I will come to some detail in a moment, but that’s the starkest example, but there are others, so we know from evidence led before you Chair that Law Enforcement Agencies failed to detect, prosecute and prevent wide scale corruption during the period under review. Why?  Was this just coincidental yet again or was it intended that it be so.   Law enforcement agencies the evidence has been were considerably weakened in the fight against corruption and crime during that same period.   It is instructive Chair that beyond the period that this commission has been concentrating on, we refer to it as the period under review, we know from evidence, and it is a fact that the National Director of Public Prosecutions has a ten year plan.  The intent of that is stability and effectiveness and independence.   Not one National Director of Public Prosecutions has lasted that ten year term. There are examples Chair of the law enforcement agencies being used to target persons who were intent on combating corruption, a list of them, days of evidence have been given before you in that regard.  Conversely Chair there are several examples of persons or entities not being prosecuted for corruption when they should have been.  Again sheer coincidence or part of an intended plan?    Executive interference in the operation of law enforcement agencies there has been evidence before you that that has occurred, and again several previous appointments and dismissals have been placed before you by way of evidence within law enforcement agencies. Now we know Chair that as President Mr Zuma had the power to appoint many of the most senior officials in law enforcement, including Ministers of Police, the National Director of Public Prosecutions or Provincial and Special Directors of Public Prosecutions, the head of Special Investigations Unit, Commissioner of Peace, Commissioner of the South, so those all were direct appointees, I think that is correct Chair. We know for example, you have heard extensive evidence of the tenure of Mr Nxasana as head of the NDPP and it appears according to the evidence that Mr Nxasana was determined to hold Ms Jiba and Mr Mgwebi accountable for their conduct in a number of cases, including interference in the BOSASA prosecution.  Their conduct has been criticised by the Courts over and over again.  The very person who sought to hold them to account we know of the circumstances surrounding the termination of his employment as NDPP. Chair we have numbers of examples in evidence of politically connected individuals being protected from the law, General Mgwebi is one example, you have heard extensive evidence about that.  The interference in the prosecution of the BOSASA entity, the investigation and prosecution and the interference in the investigation and prosecution of Mr Panday, you have got that evidence.  It is clear Chair, who was a business partner of two of Mr Zuma’s family members, this needs – this is something that needs to be raised, it needs to be answered, why were politically connected individuals apparently protected by law enforcement agencies.  From the very top why were those appointments made, why was this not detected, why was it not dealt with?   The glaring question of course is there can be no doubt that those in power knew about corruption taking place and the obvious question that ought to have been asked by those in power, by oversight bodies at Parliament, is why is this happening and why is nothing being done to stop it happening. Where is the accountability?   We have got a range of – a powerful constitutional institution with vast powers and yet nothing is being done.   Again, is this mere neglect, is it mere coincidence that at the time all the events highlighted by the evidence as happening law enforcement agencies are ...[indistinct] or is this part of an overall and deliberate plan, and the evidence appears to indicate the latter was the case Chair and that requires an answer.  As the Constitutional Court said ...[indistinct] to the fundamental institutions of our democracy.  We also have a number of examples Chair of the prosecution of persons intent on combating corruption, the North West Unit for example and its activities.
