CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Myburgh.    Yes.  I understand that there has been miscommunication about what time we start.  We are    Ja.  We will then adjourn until 11   Good morning again Mr Myburgh, good morning everybody.    Good morning, good morning.  Are you ready?    Okay.  Let us start.    Good morning Mr Singh.  You cannot hear your client oreverybody?    Your client.  Oh.    Okay alright.    Yes.      Yes.    Well Mr Myburgh might be needing to refer him to Mr Singh to another paragraph before he makes a – puts the question he wants to put.    What paragraph?    Yes.    Bring the mic closer to you.    Sorry Mr Myburgh.  Do we by any chance have a set of the court papers relating to this judgment? Do you know?    Yes.  I would like to – to see the set.    Ja, ja.  Well Mr Singh after the – this application had been launched which resulted in thisjudgment were you – did you become aware of the fact that an application had been launched at the High Court by Eskom against Trillian among others?  Did you become aware of the application pending in the High Court before the judgment?    Yes.  Yes.  Nobody sent you the papers or anything?    Okay alright.    You – I think you must put your file on top because when you speak looking down.    Ja.  When you speak looking down we cannot hear you properly.  Yes.  Yes.    I think – I think it is important that within the – within the context of Mr Myburgh’s question that you give me enough that you think gives you a fair or – a fair opportunity you know to deal with Eskom.    And obviously – obviously there is theEskom work stream …    Yes but I do not want a situation where the question might require you to deal a little more fully with the issue and you do not deal more fully with it to your detriment.  So…    I would like you to – to be able to say this is the thrust of my answer or this is my answer.    Well because Mr Myburgh is the evidence leader subject to what he says because he might be wanting a full answer on certain matters; he might be wanting not so detailed an answer on certain matters.  Mr Myburgh what is our input?    Ja.    Yes.  Ja okay alright.  So …   Ja so satisfy yourself that you have given a fair – you have given an answer that reasonably satisfies you that you have answered the question.    Ja.    Was this – was the submission of the 8 t h of August 2016 he did not recommend the approval?   Ja.  Ja.    Yes but it motivated for the approval?    Ja.    I think the – to the extent that you wantto make the distinction at a factual level that you did not approve.    Even though you may have recommended in support of the approval.    Is a fair point.    Ja okay.    Was an amount of?    Ja.    I am sorry has that document been provided because you remember in the Eskom stream I think I did mention that Mr Seleka and his team should try and obtain the document that sets those things out at Eskom.    Operating procedures or policies ja.    Ja oh well…    Yes.    Oh I think I …    Oh okay.    Okay so I have not seen them.  I think I (talking over one another).    Ja okay.    Is there.    Okay alright.  Okay.     Okay alright.     Page 875, paragraph 67.     So you accept that the interpretation of the paragraph but you say that the finding was made without your input?     Okay.     May I interrupt you Mr Myburgh?  Please do not forget your question because I do not want to forget getting this clarification from Mr Singh.  I do not know whether this would have fallen under the Transnet – it may have fallen under the Transnet work stream.  Did you deny having part – having been part or having attended themeeting that Mr Henk Bester testified about, where he said, if I recall correctly, you were there and Mr Salim Essa was there and he was there.  One, I think he testified about two meetings which he had which involved Mr Essa but I think in one of them he said you were there but most of the time it was Mr Salim Essa who was doing the talking.  But I think in the other one he did not include you.  Did you deny having been part of any meeting in which Mr Salim Essa was present as well as Mr Henk Bester?    Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     H’m?     Ja.       Yes.     Oh.     Okay alright.     Okay alright.     ...and I was wondering whether when he says he met Mr Salim twice, whether that could be one of the two times and that is why I wanted to double-check.     Do you need some assistance there, Mr Singh?     Ja, okay someone will come and assist you.    Okay.  In that event, we must just make sure that he gets the chance to substantiate his ...[intervenes]   Yes.Ja, maybe – ja, to give...[intervenes]      Yes.     H’m.     H’m?     Just repeat that, please?     Well, it is clear from that sentence that Mr Bester, at least it seems to me, is meeting somebody that he did not know before.  I get the impression that Mr Essa on Mr Bester ’s version walked to him andintroduced himself.  Obviously, he could only do that if he thought he was the person he expected to meet there.     If he had been told how he looks like or something like that.     H’m?    You denied that Mr Essa...?     H’m?     H’m.     H’m.  Yes.  Well, in paragraph 58, he says that the meeting centred around payments from Transnet to Hatch for work that had been performed on the MMP and Hatch was supposed to have been paid within 45-days after submitting invoices to Transnet but he says the meeting was superficial because you did not offer any insight into the reasons for the late payments of system communication that could potentially improve the payments.And he says he thought you were probablydisappointed with the meeting.He had a distinct impression that you had hoped that the discussion were going centre around Hatch working with Reddy and his group, rather, and to resolve Hatch issues of outstanding payments. He said throughout the meeting, he got the impression that Essa was the boss and you were his subordinate.       Yes.  Did you know Mr Hatch at all while you were at Transnet?  Sorry.  No, no Mr Bester.  Did you know Mr Bester at all when you – while – when you were at Transnet?     Yes.  So, but you ...[intervenes]      This ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Which you were supposed to attend, according to him.     ...walking up and down the passage.     Oh, that is an earlier one.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, okay.    Ja.     H’m.     But on, as I understand it and you musttell me if I misunderstand you.  On your version, Mr Henk Bester just fabricated this whole idea of this meeting and that he had a meeting with you and Mr Salim Essa?     H’m.  And why do you think he would want to falsely and deliberately put you in a meeting that you did not attend?     Yes.  But the two of you never had any issues?     Yes.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh.     Let me put this proposition.  Coming – going back to my question to you about this meeting.  What would you say to the proposition or a proposition along these lines that on your own version Mr Henk Bester had no reason to fabricate a story like this against you but maybe you might have a reason to deny that a such a meeting took place even if it did take place because it might associate you with Mr Salim Essa who has lots of allegations of corruption against him.  What would you sayto such a proposition?     Okay.     Ja.     Okay.     And those are the ones that you have articulated.     You want to clarify it?     Okay. [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Yes.     H’m.     Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Myburgh.     For what it is worth, I just mention thatwhen Mr Bester makes the allegation that Mr Essa said the contract value eventually increased to over R2 billion, it is difficult to read that without thinking about the trains which – where the value increased drastically.  That crosses my mind, that is all I am saying.     Ja, no, I am not giving any figures but I know there was – there are transactions where the values increased in a manner that is very unusual.  Yes, MrMyburgh?     Maybe before you proceed, Mr Myburgh.  Mr Singh, if this meeting which you said you know nothing about takes place, the challenge with your version is that Mr Bester say in effect it was a follow up on the previous meeting which you say is a fabrication?     Yes, so I am just mentioning that there is that challenge.    Well, the challenge is this.  If Mr Bester is correct that this was a follow up meeting then there must have been an earlier meeting then the earlier meeting would only the one he is talking about.     But if you say it was – if it was not a follow up, it was a standalone meeting, that is different.     Yes.  So you deny that you were part of the meeting.     Yes.  You do not deny that there may have been a meeting involving them without you.     Yes.  Okay, alright.  But then if that was the case then Mr Bester must really have been singling you out to just falsely put you in that meeting in a very strange way because a meeting took place and you would haveknown who were in that meeting but he brings you in knowing that you were not in that meeting.  That would be the implication.     Ja.     Yes, yes, okay.  Mr Myburgh?     I am sorry, are you talking about an affidavit where you are responding to Mr Bester ’s affidavit that we are looking at now?     Okay, is it in the bundle, Mr…?     Okay, alright.    Continue?     Okay.     Ja.     I am sorry, just repeat the page?     Okay.     Okay, I have found it Mr Myburgh, I just wanted to know where it is because I might have to just read it again.     Okay, alright.  We go back to bundle 4?    In which bundle?     Oh, a different one, ja.     Together with Essa.     Yes, Mr Myburgh, continue?    So you say that he is also just fabricating this story of having seen you having a meeting with MrEssa in your office.     And are you able to offer any reason why Mr Gama would want to falsely implicate you in a meeting with Mr Salim Essa in your office?    Yes, okay.     Just tell me what proposition?     Mr Myburgh?     Well, Ms van den Heever, I am going to add to what Mr Myburgh says about Mr Salim Essa’s modusoperandi, I am going to add something that is not in the Transnet work stream because I happened to hear evidence relating to different work streams, it is something that happened in the Denel work stream, Mr Essa …[intervenes]     Mr Essa sought out the CEO of the Denel, Mr Saloojee and called him to a meeting at the Gupta house and on the evidence that has been led here, sought to have Mr Saloojee agree to some businesses involving Denel and entities that Mr Salim Essa was connected with.     Yes, okay.     Yes, no, no, that is fine.  Okay.     Well, actually, now that Mr Myburgh has asked that question, I wanted to say to you when I asked you a question about whether Mr – you were saying Mr Gama was fabricating all of this about this meeting, I was under the wrong impression that he saw you sitting with Mr Salim Essa on his version while he was passing, but I see that he actually says he did enter your office.    Which means he had a proper opportunity  to see who you were with on his version.   So as opposed to maybe just passing and seeing inside your office through a window or glass or something.  So he says he did enter, so which means that it is unlikely he would be mistaken about if he saw you with somebody that might not have been Salim Essa, if he was just passing and saw through a window.  But here he says he entered so if his version is true he had enough opportunity to see who the person was that you were having a meeting with.  Alright, I understand that you sayno such meeting took place, I just wanted to clarify because earlier on I was under the impression that he did not enter your office but it is clear from his version that he says he did enter.  But you say nothing of that sort happened.    Okay.  Mr Myburgh?     Please just repeat your answer, it was soft.     ...to dispute. He wants you to comment and say whether that is true or it is not true or what you have to say about it.     So ...[intervenes]     Yes.     So Mr Singh, I do not know if you pick up what I pick up here.  the meeting that Mr Gama on his version subsequently held, had with Mr Essa either in October or November, which he deals with at paragraph31.4, is a follow up on the discussion that he says Mr Salim Essa had on the day that he had a meeting with you in your office, that is Mr Salim Essa and Mr Gama says he entered your office and spoke to you briefly and as he was leaving, Mr Salim Essa followed him and asked, and said he would like to have a meeting with you. So this is a follow up meeting arising out of that.  So we spoke earlier on about a follow up meeting that Mr Henk Bester talked about with Mr Salim Essa, having had on his version a meeting with Mr Salim Essa and yourself. So you say you cannot dispute that this October / November meeting of Mr Gama and Salim Essa took place, but you say definitely the meeting that he talks about, that is Mr Gama in your office with Mr Salim Essa, did not take place.     No, he does not say that.  He says he had met Mr Salim Essa earlier, prior to your, to him seeing you with him in your office.  Paragraph 31.2.3, he had met him, it was about approximately ten people.  I think it was at Regiments.He had, so he does not have to say you introduced him to Salim Essa.  He had met Salim Essa before.      Hm?     You are not suggesting that Mr Bester and Mr Gama came together for, which are stories that...[intervenes]     Well, you said what you said but one of the things you did was you conceded that if I recall correctly, that he would not have had a motive to falsely implicate you.   Yes.     And where is Mr Gama?    Well, he does not link it to meeting you and or meeting with Mr Salim Essa at your office.  But anyway, Mr Myburgh?    What is the convenience?      Well, I am not sure that I understand the convenience part, but let ... I think we must proceed Mr Myburgh.      Ja.     I am sorry, just repeat that?  It did not contain this particular paragraph?    Ja.     Yes, oh.      Yes.     Ja.     Yes.  Mr Myburgh?      Okay.     Are we going back to Bundle 5B?    5C.  I see that we are at quarter to one.    But I guess 15 minutes might still be used.     Ja, ja okay.  Yes.  What is the page on the ...[intervenes]     Okay.      You said 308, you mean 380?    Ja.     1573?      1713.      I am sorry.  You said page 1716?    Yes.    Yes.     Oh, yes.     Okay.    Yes, let us take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two.  We adjourn.   INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let’s continue.     I’m sorry 1?     Yes.     Oh, okay. ADV MYBURGH SC  And then the other correction that needs to be made is that when you get right to the bottom, and it refers to Transfer Money Market that first account there ...[intervenes]      I am sorry, I just want to make sure that I correct this.  To prepare a supplementary or replacement ...[intervenes]      Okay, no that’s fine.     Ja.     On ...[intervenes]      Yes.     607?     Oh.     Yes, okay, okay.     In other words what was the source of the money you used to incorporate those other accounts from which you were funding your living expenses and the like.     Does that mean you are not going to give the answer or what?     Yes.     So are you saying your remuneration from Transnet didn’t come through one account it went through it went into different bank accounts, are you saying that the remuneration from Transnet that we see reflectedin this bank account over that period doesn’t give the true picture of the money you were getting from Transnet?        Yes.     Yes.     And so the funds that you say you used to finance you living expenses and your lifestyle during the three years that we are talking about, you say that came from your remuneration from Transnet but not from the remuneration during those three years but from prior years.     Okay so does that mean in the years prior to these three years you didn’t – you had enough to spend during those years and have a lot of reserves and savings or what?     So in short generally speaking the money that went into those other accounts that you are talking about was also money from Transnet, it was your remuneration it is just that you saved a lot of money during those years and you were able during these three years when you didn’t touch the salary that came in during thosethree years, you were able to use whatever money you had accumulated over those prior years?     Okay, Mr Myburgh?     So you are saying you can’t be sure whether if somebody were to go through the whatever monies came in, into those accounts, you can’t be surethat there won’t be money that came from somewhere else other than Transnet, here and there but mainly it was Transnet and it was there anything that came from somewhere else it might be a very small percentage?     Yes.     Ja, yes, ja.     Yes, ja.    Ja, okay.      What is the last one?     Yes.     The Investec account ...[intervenes]      The Investec account?     Credit card, Investec credit card, that is the one you predominantly used?     Okay.   Let me take this chance to just confirm something.  The payments that you would have made to Travel Excellence for your trips, do you remember when you were giving evidence under the Exco Eskom workstream, you said sometimes you paid by cash, sometimes I think EFT and sometimes you used ebucks but which of the accounts would you have normally used for those payments and for trips?     You wouldn’t recall, but if you were predominantly using the Investec Credit Card there might be a good chance that maybe that is where one could look, you remember we said we need to look at the bank statements and bank record and see ...[intervenes]     The Investec credit card.     Yes, okay, alright.        Oh yes, yes.  I thought you said you recently recalled that you would have used it.      Ja 2014/2015.   Okay, but if one could look at your Investec Credit Card and look at the ABSAaccount and FNB, okay.     Ja,     Did you say they were predominantly case the payments? MR SINGH   Based on our testimony we had given previously yes sir.     Oh, okay, so there would have been few EFT payments?     Okay so most were cash?     Okay, I had not understood your evidence like that before, so most were cash and there might have been a few that were EFT.     And those that were EFT would either be ABSA or Investec account.    H’m.  Okay.  I think not usually Mr Myburgh, predominantly, or mostly, mostly, ja.     No, he is asking whether we can take it that – he says he understood your evidence when you were being questioned by Mr Seleka to be that usually or most of the time the payments were in cash but there were sometimes when it was through other means, but he is saying as he understands you now you are saying – he was saying usually, and I was correcting, as you are saying most of the time it was cash, that is what you are saying, that is what you said, so he was wanting to confirm that he understands you correctly.    Okay alright.     Mr Myburgh?     Okay, we will take a let’s say five minutes adjournment.     We adjourn.INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let’s continue.  Your mic Mr Myburgh.     Why would that preclude you from putting it in an interest bearing account.  I can understand if you say they earned little interest because they were in an account that pay you little interest because if youwanted to get a high interest rate you would have had to put the away for a long time without having access to them, but I don’t understand when you use that to say put them where you wouldn’t earn any interest at all.     Mr Myburgh?     Well Mr Myburgh is quite entitled to put what he is putting to Mr Singh, what do you say about that Mr Singh?   But you – you are so highly qualified in finance how  could you have to wait to e advised by a private banker to put your money into an interest bearing account.     Well I am not sure that I understand that answer Mr Singh because I understood you earlier on to be saying the reason why you were quite content, and I know Iam using my own words now, you were quite content to have such large amounts to remain in an account that didn’t give you interest was because you needed to have access to these funds.   Now that is an answer of somebody who was aware that he was not getting interest in these accounts, but for certain reasons was – had no problem with that because of whatever reasons he had, but if you had – if you knew that the account, if your impression was that the account was giving you a low interest as opposed to zero interest then when Mr Myburghsaid to you why did you keep such large amounts in an account that didn’t give you any interest your answer wasn’t going to be that because I wanted to have access to the money, your answer would have been no, no, no, these accounts did give me interest but it was a low interest, but it is not correct to say it did not give me interest, that would have been  your answer.  What do you say to that?     Mr Myburgh?    Well let me ask this question, as I understand your evidence you, and you say you needed liquidity, that is why you kept these large amounts in an account that didn’t give you interest, you mean you wanted to be able to draw cash from it or use it if and when you had a need?      No, not that is fine.     No Ms van den Heever, no please.     I heard you.  And Mr Singh is equally able to say exactly that, and I think in a way he had begun to say something, okay, so you are saying there is a reason which made it necessary for you to have cash of that size, of millions of rands, ready should you need it?     And that is a reason that you would rather disclose not publically.     Okay, Mr Myburgh?  I believe that Mr Myburgh if you want to take ...[intervenes]      Yes.    Yes.     Yes, I think maybe we should do that, he should put that in an affidavit and because I think we won’t finish with him today.     And then I can see that and then we can then take it from there.  Okay.      Alright, you will do that Mr Singh?     Okay alright.     Maybe just to make sure there is no misunderstanding I am not ruling that whatever information Mr Singh will give in that affidavit will not be disclosed, but I am simply saying initially let me have a look at it without it being made public then we can take it from there, okay.     Okay.     Okay, alright.  Ten minutes?     Yes, okay alright, let’s take ten minutes adjournment.We adjourn.     I understand that counsel for Mr Singh would like to request that we adjourn for the day.     Yes, but I think without going into details, it is related to Mr Singh’s health, I think that ...[intervenes]      That is my understanding, you confirm, ja.   Mr Myburgh?ADV MYBURGH     Yes, okay, we are going to then adjourn because of health related reasons to Mr Singh and another date will be arranged.   It is just important that we say something because the public knows that we don’t have time so we cannot be seen to be not using time that is available for no valid reason, so – okay we are going to adjourn, another date will be determined for Mr Singh to continue with his evidence, so we will adjourn for the day,and for the benefit of the public on Monday the Commission will hear the evidence of Mr Gama, Siyabonga Gama under the Transnet work stream during the day and in the evening Mr Myburgh?     Yes.     After that ja, okay, alright.  We adjourn. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson.     Thank you Chair.     And then if we go, finally, to the order.  It starts at paragraph 70 at page 876 and I just want to direct your attention to page 878 following on the paragraph that I have read.  There were two orders that Ijust want to put to you or ask – bring to your attention.     So, Mr Singh, as I read paragraph 67 ...[intervenes]     ...of this judgment.  You were found, in effect, to have been in a corrupt relationship with Mr Essa.     67.     Yes, 876, paragraph 67.     When you read that paragraph in thecontext of the judgment, in effect, you have found to have been in a corrupt relationship with Mr Essa.     Yes.     Yes, but what I am putting to you is my interpretation of that paragraph is that you were found to have been in a corrupt relationship with Mr Essa because the directors of Trillian referred to are Essa and the senior officials of Eskom that are referred to are you and Mr Koko.     Alright.  Now, whilst on the issue of Mr Essa.  You will recall that on the first occasion that you gave evidence, I took you to parts of Mr Bester ’s affidavit. We are still going to come back to that.     And he said that he met with you and Mr Essa at Melrose Arch at a restaurant there in approximately April 2014 and you, as I recall, you denied that.  Correct?     And as I understand it, your evidence before the Commission, and you must correct me if I am wrong, is that you only ever met Mr Essa twice.     And you met him in the context of him wanting to meet you to explore potential business opportunities and I am talking about Transnet.  You say that those meetings might have happened at Melrose Archbut that was the sum-total of your meetings with Mr Essa.  Is that correct?     And as I understand it.  You now in evidence content that both was when you were at Transnet and Eskom.     You said when you were at Eskom, you had no need to work with Mr Essa.     So your testimony before this Commission is.  You have met this man only twice?     Informally, outside of Transnet?     So that then brings me to something that I did not ask you the last time and that is the testimony of Mr Gama.  And you have been provided with the relevant extract of his affidavit.     Yes.  With ...[intervenes]      Yes, it was not.  You are right.  You denied this.  And perhaps just to refresh everyone’s memory.  You have – if you could please go to Transnet Bundle 4, Exhibit BB-19.       Thank you, Chair.     I think it is in the files...     On page – so you need to go to the tab that say BB-19.     And then if you could turn to page 45 of BB-19?    This is Mr Ester(sic) – Bester ’s, I beg your pardon, affidavit.  And this is the meeting that the DCJ was asking you about.  I just want to reflect on it. “Upon my arrival at Melrose Arch, as I walked towards the restaurant, I was met by a gentleman who introduced himself as Mr Salim Essa. He said that he was there to meet with us as part of the discussion with Singh and needed to see if the restaurant is clean. I asked him where Singh was and he said that he will call him when he is ready. I asked Essa whether he himself works for Transnet and he responded that he is doing alot of things or something to the effect that I have a lot of businesses. He clearly had no intention of answering my question in detail. I was surprised at the time that as soon as Essa called Singh, Singh arrived a few minutes later...”This is the meeting that you denied, is that so?     So you stand then by your testimonythat you only ever met Mr Essa twice in the circumstances that I have described and you have confirmed?     I think you have already dealt with that but it is my intention to come back to MMP to finish off that later.  Now ...[intervenes]      Okay.  Mr Singh, perhaps you could just deal with that now so it will not ...[intervenes]      Yes, thank you.  Perhaps I could justtake you to a few other paragraphs because there was another meeting that Mr Bester had with Mr Essa and that you see at paragraph 59 at page 46. “Soon after this meeting, I received a call...”But perhaps before I lose my train of thought.  Can I ask you this?  Do I understand you know to say - or perhaps I could put it differently.  Did you ever receive telephone calls or make telephone calls to Mr Essa whilst you were at Transnet?     Not a single one?     Even around the two meetings that you had?     The two meetings that you have told us about.     You did have telephone calls around those meetings?     So you had not – you placed not a single call to Mr Essa at your time at Transnet and he placed not a single call to you?     Alright.     Yes, thank you.  Now just incidentally.  The affidavit does read that Mr Simmer and Sumption accompanied Mr Bester to this meeting.  That you will see at paragraph 56.     Yes.  And in fact, Mr Bester testified to that.So Mr Singh, what we do know is that ...[intervenes]      Fair enough.  What we do know, Mr Singh, that this is a very important allegation made against you.     You did not apply to cross-examine Mr Bester.     In fact, you applied – you have not applied to cross-examine anyone.     I see.  Now let us go to the next meeting that Mr Essa had with Mr Bester.  At paragraph 59,    Alright ...[intervenes]     I am going to come to that.      I am not sure ...[intervenes]     Why do you say he conveniently linksit to you?  What would ...[intervenes]     Thank you.  So I want to then take you to the first time that Mr Gama met Mr Essa.  This is at paragraph 31.2.  You have referred to this at page 47.  He    Transnet’s offices during 2015.     He did in his evidence, he said the Carlton Centre.     I am asking you are you able to dispute this?   That is what I wanted to put to you.  I mean on this version Mr Essa came to the offices at the Carlton Centre, was it unusual?  You say you never saw him.    Yes.    Yes, thank you and do you feel that you have been able to answer the questions that I have posed to you in relation to those two paragraphs now adequately?    Alright.     Yes, you can put that away.  I would like to now deal with the FNB account.     Bundle 5C Chairperson.    Yes, it is Chair.     I am sure we can use it, yes.     Page 1568.     So at 1568 you find an affidavit, a short affidavit from Mr Benjamin running to 1572.  Youhave had an opportunity to read this affidavit I take it?    Could I ask you please to go to paragraph 6, it is an affidavit of Mr Benjamin.  He is the head of the Transnet stream investigation team as you    380, I beg your pardon.   Mr Benjamin refers to that as the    And it seems from paragraph 8.6.8 that the question was asked of you as to what the source of the funds in this account were.     And that your answer was, it is effectively your remuneration from Transnet and or Eskom.     If I could take you back then to Mr Benjamin’s affidavit.  At paragraph 7 at page 1569 he introduced the extract from the Fundudzi report which we    Then at paragraph 11   1713.      You see that Mr Singh?    Perhaps you can just keep your finger there and then go back to page 1570 and pick up at    Then you can keep your finger there,    Sorry?    You go to page 1716 of the spreadsheet, at the bottom, number 41.  This is taken from the October statement and you will see over the page that the balance reflected in bold.    Is the R19 884 811-32.  You see that?    So 1716, you go to item 41, BCJ atthe bottom.     That is dealing with, it is taken from the October 15 statement.    And if you go over the page still dealing with October 15, you will see on the right hand side in bold highlighted.     There is the number, the 19 millionthat we are speaking of.     Would you confirm that Mr Singh?      Then if you go back to paragraph 17,    Paragraph 19.  In paragraph 20.4.2    Paragraph 21   And then the last paragraph which brings us to the stroke of lunch time, coincidentally,    Chairperson, it is now one o’clock.  If this is a convenient time?     Thank you.  Mr Singh could I just ask you please to go to page 1716 of Bundle 5C.     1716.    Are you there, alright, I just wanted to confirm with reference to the shading, I think you’ve given evidence previously that – and you must correct me if I am wrong, that when you were seconded to Eskom you were still paid for a time by Transnet, is my recollection correct?     Do you want to keep your mask on or is it by mistake?    So at item 38 on the left hand side there we see in shading your July salary, Transnet, then you were at Transnet?     And then we see a Transnet salary in August and September, but in those months you had been seconded to Eskom.     And then you also see in October it seems what happened is that you were then paid out Transnet LTI’s, I take it that’s long term incentives on a proportionate basis.     And you were also then paid someleave.     Which then takes us to the balance that we had spoken about before.  DCJ I need to point out to you that there are some corrections that need to be made at page 1718.     You will see that if you look at 1717 right at the bottom, number 57, there a schedule is dealing with February 2017, when you go to 1718 and you pick upat March it reflects March 2016, so those years in that column should actually be 17.    DCJ I have asked Mr Benjamin to ...[intervenes]      He will prepare a supplementary affidavit and there will be a replacement page.   None of this is particularly material for present purposes.     Then under the heading transfer money account ...[intervenes]      1718 at the bottom.     The first of those accounts thereends 398 that actually is an incorrect account number, it should be an account number ending 607.     Yes, and those fours that you see under the heading transfer money account it just needs to be clarified that that is actually the 4 t h of December.     So that should be 4/7.     So what we have here really in summary Mr Singh is that in three years or three months or so we see an accumulation of about R19million in salary – let me call it remuneration, it is not just salary it is also incentives and the like and we see outflows of just of R700 000, that’s all in those three years and three months,so the question that I just want to discuss with you is how is that you were funding your day to day expenses and your lifestyle during these three years, three years and three months?     Yes, that I understand, but how did you pay for them?   Because on the face you weren’t using your salary – your remuneration, let me use that lauded term, that is really the question I am asking you.  I mean obviously you must have like everyone had accounts and debit orders and the like.  The question really goes to how were you funding that ...[intervenes]     So in short you drew from your savings?    That’s not, it is not quite as simple as you say because we have been asked as you know to produce the summonses in relation to your bank account records and in the process of trying to put that together we have come to learn that you had many, many bank accounts, I mean do I understand correctly that you might have had as many as 12 FNB accounts?     But then you also had multiple accounts at Investec, multiple accounts at Capitec, multiple accounts at Standard Bank and multiple accounts at ABSA.        And so as I understand what you are saying is that the Commission can to and analyse all of those accounts and then work out how you were funding your living expenses but which of these accounts did you actually use as a current account, because you weren’t using this as a current account.  Which of your bank accounts did you use as a functioning day to day current account, debit orders for medical aid, bonds, whatever it is?     The ABSA and Standard Bank current accounts.     Alright.     Sorry?     I mean when you say ...[intervenes]      You say recently?    But we’re talking about 2014.     And the we can find the payments to Travel Excellence.     They were predominantly cash?      You see Mr Singh my recollection of your evidence when Mr Seleka was questioning you in relation to those payments that your evidence was the other way round, that you said look occasionally you would pay in cash but you explained that you would use a variety of different means.  Can we take it now that you’re settling on that usually you paid in cash?     So predominantly cash.  So the other thing I wanted to ask you is this is as these bank statements show this was not an interest bearing account, you didn’t receive any interest?     And in fact what it shows is that there was a time when you transferred out, this is in 2016, I think it is R16million into two money market accounts,that you see if you would like to look at page 1717, line item 15, you see there was a transfer of one million and five million into account 608, that is R6million, and then there was a transfer of one million and nine million and ten million into the Money Market account ending in 607, do you see that?     And I can take you to those statements but once you made those transfers on a monthly basis you were getting almost R100 000 in interest.     Why did you not put these proceeds or the inflow into an interest bearing account, I mean this is a huge amount of money, when you did that you madeR100 000 a month.     I have no objection.     Are you in a position to answer my q question.      The question was why didn’t you put the money into an interest bearing account?     Yes, when you say the interest rate was relatively low there was no interest in these accounts, unless you have a better sense of them than me, but let me just take you – and you must correct me if I am wrong.  Let’s go to the first one, 1580.     It wasn’t a matter of being relatively low, the interest was zero.     Mr Singh you were chief financial officer of Eskom, of Transnet, I beg your pardon, and you needed a private banker to tell you that ...[intervenes]      Mr Singh perhaps I can just ask you this, and you are much better versed in this than I am at the moment, but just as a typical man in the street really isn’t it general knowledge that a current account would bear much lower interest, an ordinary current account, than any investment account, than a Money Market account?     Yes, but that is really I think the DCJis getting at, on your own version you thought it was low, we said it was zero, you say you didn’t know that for some reason, but if you knew you were in a current account you didn’t need to know the interest rate, why didn’t you move the money into a Money Market account?     I am not sure I understand why you would forego liquidity if you put it into an ordinary savings account for example.    Mr Singh I am just going to ask you one thing, I mean did you pay less or more attention to your personal financial affairs than you did the affairs of Transnet?     I see.    And did you think you were going to have a need for millions?     I am  happy for that to be done privately, you would be of a much better sense DCJ of how we should go about doing that.     Whether we go offline, whether Mr Singh should put in an affidavit.     We are in your hands.     Yes.     Perfect.     Alright, Mr Singh I now want to go back to where I started briefly yesterday.   You will remember that I said to you ...[intervenes]      Thank you DCJ.  So I said thatbefore I deal with the transaction advisors and appointment of consultants ...[intervenes]      In the evening we first will have Mr Gigaba’s application in relation to Ms Gigaba’s evidence.     And then obviously subject to what you may or may not rule Ms Gigaba might give evidence after that. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. PROCEEDINGS RESUMES     All rise.INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     All rise. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Good morning DCJ.    Yes thank you DCJ.    Good morning Mr Singh.    I would like just to go back to the issue of your travel. When you – when you went to Eskom did you continue making these personal/private trips to Dubai?    Can I ask you…    Alright well let me repeat the question then if I my DCJ?   I had asked you whether after you went to Eskom you continued with your personal/private trips to Dubai and I understand you answered yes?    Could I ask you please to go to Bundle 5(b) Exhibit BB23.  And could you turn – could you turn to page 829 in fact to 828.      Are you there?    Now this is a judgment of the High Court in the matter between Eskom McKinsey and Trillian etcetera where Eskom sought to overturn the payments made to Trillian.  I just want to take you to a few paragraphof this judgment insofar as it relates to you.  Could you please go to paragraph 16 – 16 at page 835.      At the foot of page 835 paragraph 16    I just …    I want to take you to paragraph 56 at page 868 and just continues the theme obviously Mr Singh I am going to give you an opportunity to answer or to raise whatever you want to.  At 56  “Corruption is the only issue that Trillianseems even though feebly to put in issue.  Upon examination of the undisputed facts it seems that even on this aspect Trillian fails to make out a case.  One of the events that stand out in the corruption collaboration – sorry in the corrupt collaboration between Trillian and Eskom officials was the all expenses paid trips enjoyed by Eskom officials Koko and Anoj Singh to Dubai which were arranged by Mr Essa and    And you need speak into the mic.   Alright and then if I can take…    I am sure we can obtain them DCJ.    Yes.      Thank you.  And then at paragraph 57    Chairperson I have no difficulty with Mr Singh.    Providing whatever explanation he wishes to give at this time.    Excuse me thank you.  Before I go on further into the judgment could I ask you just to go back please to page 856.  There the Judge quotes from an extract from Eskom’s affidavit 47.2 “Eskom expands on the corrupt linkbetween Trillian, Essa and the Gupta family when it says quote as I have mentioned Mr Essa was the majority shareholder and a director of Trillian Capital Partners.  I attach Mr Essa’s biography as well as relevant extracts from a PIPC director search as annexure PH14 and PH15.  Mr Essa is widely known to be a close associate of the Gupta family.  Annexure PH15 reflects Mr Essa’s role as a directorof VR Laser another company with close links to the Gupta family. Mr Koko has also admitted that he attended private meetings with Mr Essa regarding Trillian’s work at Eskom.  In this regard I attach relevant extracts of Mr Koko’s testimony in Parliament as Annexure PH16.”Do you want to – do you have any comment on that?    Are you suggesting that you did not know that Mr Essa was a shareholder and director of Trillian?    So you came to learn – sorry whose termination letter?    Alright.  So you only came to learn of this right at the end?    Did you not have any dealings with Mr Essa in relation to Trillian?    I see.  And then let us go to the conclusion.  Paragraph 67 at page 875.   “In the present matter where the probabilities are apparent.”    875 paragraph 67.    875.  I think you appear to be in a – are you in the right file?    Yes it is.    Paragraph 67. “In the present matter where the probabilities are apparent that senior officials of Eskom would leave no stone unturned to benefit Trillian where confidential information belonging to Eskom was leaked to Trillian where senior personnel of Eskom who were expected to display the conduct of the utmost good faith and to act in the best interests of Eskomwhere there appears to be a corrupt relationship between Eskom’s senior personnel and the directors of Trillian justice and equity demand nothing less than that the monies paid to Trillian unjustifiably be returned to Eskom.”Any comment on that? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Morning Chairperson.   Sorry Chairperson I cannot hear you.    I cannot hear my learned friend.    Chairperson.    And I also need to hear him it is very important.    Chairperson would it not be convenient if Mr Singh answers the various points put to him by my learned friend otherwise it becomes a very long statement and we might have to repeat it.    Chairperson, I wanted – or I left my learned friend to pursue this point but I really have to object at this point in time.  When you put a proposal like this to a witness you must have a factual basis on which you put the proposal and …[intervenes]     That this is his modus operandi.  The way that my learned friend is putting it to Mr Singh, heis asking him to comment on a factual statement that my learned friend is making and I am submitting to you there is not a basis for him making such a factual statement unless he can direct me where in the bundles he has got it under oath and I will then ask forgiveness for having missed it.     Chairperson, I again object.  That is not so.  Look at what is stated by Mr Gama.     Chairperson, I just missed …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chairperson.  Of course, we have no knowledge of that, so…    So my objection was based on a proposal that was put that was nowhere to be found in our bundle.    Chairperson I ...[intervenes]       Chairperson is that a question or is it a statement, or what is my learned friend trying todo?    Chairperson if we go off line and we go in camera I am sure my client will at that stagedisclose it, right now he doesn’t want to disclose his private business for all and sundry to hear.     There is nothing nefarious or strange about it, there is a very legitimate reason for it, but if you insist we can go in camera and he can tell you.     But what I am saying Chairperson we can disclose it to the Commission ...[intervenes]     We wanted to ask if possible at this point to adjourn, we have explained to Chairperson in chambers what is the reason, I do not think it is necessary to publically broadcast it, I hope you understand the reasons and ...[intervenes]      Put simply. 
MR SINGH:  Good morning Sir, morning Chair.    If I recall correctly yes.    That is correct.    I am there.    Yes.    I am there.    Thank you Mr Chair.  I think you – we refer this entire …    Oh sorry.      Sorry Sir.    Mr Chair if we refer to the entire how can I say – matter between Eskom and McKinsey and Trillian Mr you will note that I was not cited as a party to this application.   So for me to comment on these matters would be inappropriate but to the extent that Mr Myburgh to adviseme to comment on paragraph 15 and to the extent that we have dealt with these matters yesterday Mr Chair I am – if    Mr Chair at the time I do not recall but I would think through the media I did become aware.    No Sir.   Mr Chair again in terms of the objective evidence that is presented by Eskom demonstrates…sorry Sir.    Let me do this.   Mr Chair in terms of let us start with probably the last sentence.  In terms of the objective evidence presented by Eskom Mr Chair again reiterate I was not party to this application so I am not privy to the evidence that was actually presented by Eskom to demonstrate the issue of – that speaks to the theme of consistently corrupt behaviour.On whose part I am extremely – I do not know whothat – whose part it is.  Mr Chair if we look at the – the paragraph 57.1, 57.2, 57.3, 57,4 and 57,5 and we will take them in turn.     Mr Chair can we do…    I was just going to suggest that.    Well Mr Chair I think maybe…    I think Mr Chair with the understanding thatwe still going to traverse these issues in the Eskom stream I will provide you with the context and the background behind 57.3 to the extent that I think it is necessary here with the understanding that will more fully cover it.    Thank you Mr.    Okay.    So let us come back to 57.3.  So we have dealt with 57.5; we have dealt with 57.4 Mr Chair 57.2. “Trillian sent invoices directly to Singh as what appeared to be Trillian’s contactperson at Eskom.”  Mr Chair 57.2 as I recall in terms of the evidence that we presented on the Eskom stream okay.  The – if memory serves me correctly the only invoice that was actually sent to me directly was the invoice for the corporate plan that related to the R30 million payment.  I do not recall if any of the MSA invoices were actually sent to me.  And Mr Chair again the issue of Singh appears to be Trillian’s contact person at Eskom I think we have explained and traversed again in the Eskom stream.   Any connotation as it relates to me being Trillian’s contact person in a – how can I say – unsavoury manner I think we reject because we have explained that the invoice relating to corporate plan was sent to me directly because I was a recipient of those Sir.  And as I say Mr Chair again this is from memory.  In terms of the 57.1 Singh was a signatory to the board tender committee submissions on 8 t h August which motivated for R1.8 billion settlement inclusive of the BBBEE partner which was not identified.   Mr Chair factually that is not disputed.  I did sign the memo I did recommend the memo and Mr Chair the recommendation of the memo was on the basis that the board tender committee had the mandate to either approve or disapprove.  I did not hold the mandate because you will recall that prior to the 8 t h of August 2016 I think sometime in June 2016 the board tender committee had already taken a resolution to terminate the board – the Master Services Agreement with McKinsey and its sub-contractors. And that resolution empowered a settlement process to be engaged upon following the 28 t h June letter from McKinsey let us call it letter of demand.   So Mr Chair again in context I did not approve a R1.8 billion settlement.  The document was prepared based on a request from the board tender committee that emanated in June visa vie the settlement and the termination.    Mr Chair it was a recommendation for them to consider the settlement.    So yes.    Yes.    But the actual approval actually sat with the board tender committee themselves.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Chair in terms of – so then going back to 57.3 Mr Chair because I am trying to deal with it in chronological order.  The board tender committee in December 2016 resolution appointed Singh, Koko and Mabelane to negotiate a final settlement with – included the payments for the partner.  And she says subsequent tothe approval of the 8 t h of August a 1.8 the board tender committee I think at that point approved the payment of R800 million of the R1.8 but there was continuous – there was still a settlement process that was – that was still on-going because the eventual amount that was actually settled on was an amount of R1.6.    R1.6 billion.    And the settlement agreement Mr Chair wasultimately signed between Eskom and McKinsey in February 2017.  So that is the context behind the December 2016 resolution of the board tender committee.  In this on-going negotiation process they then requested that myself, Mr Koko and Mr Mabelane engage with McKinsey to find a lower value than the R1.8 that they had originally – that they had originally approved and at that time Mr Chair I think this coincided with the independent review that had been done by Oliver Wyman and that was the basis for let us ask for a lower amount.  Okay.   Mr Chair again in terms of this the resolution appointed us to do this we engaged with them, we nego – we engaged with McKinsey – when I say we I think it was primarily Mr Govender and Mr Mabelane that used then the Oliver Wyman report to settle – to arrive at a settlementvalue of R1.6 billion which was then I think taken to the board tender committee in February and then was settled upon approval by the board tender committee which then resulted in Mr Mabelane signing the final settlement agreement with McKinsey which then affected the last payment of R1.6.   Mr Chair if we then go on to the point of evidently there is a consistent pattern of behaviour of these senior officials which at the end of the day benefitted Trillian.   Mr Chair I deny any benefit – any favouritism that Ihad showed toward Trillian or McKinsey for that matter.  As I understand it Mr Chair the negotiations that were undertaken between Mabelane and Mr Govender in terms of the settlement process was actually done with McKinsey.  Another theme of conduct of these officials was that whenever invoices landed at the Eskom desk they were settled with alacrity and with a total and unseemingly disregard for Eskom’s internal prescripts regarding payment approval.  Mr Chair again on the Eskom stream we went into a level of detail and we have also provided in our supplementary affidavits to the commission the roles and responsibilities of who approves – approves payments; how payments are approved; who the officials are that actually checks invoices and the like.   Mr Chair just for clarity.    Yes.  So we – if you recall Mr Chair I think it was on the last day that we came for the Eskom stream previously where we put up a supplementary affidavit and itwas relatively voluminous.    And we wanted to start with that and then it was decided that listen we will continue with Mr Seleka’s …    And we will come back to –     So that – so those things are in that bundle.    So we will certainly come back to that Mr Chair.    So the commission has not actually seen them.   But the documentation is with…    In the possession of the – as part of one of our supplementary affidavits.    So Mr Chair again if we look at the wording of this it says  “The conduct of these officials” And I can only assume that they are referring tomyself and Mr Koko.  Mr Chair these invoices that the refer to on the MSA that was approved and paid I certainly did not play any role in the manner  in which they were approved – in the manner in which they were processed in the system for them to be paid.   And again there is no evidence to suggest that I was the one that engaged in the payment of these invoices. I think Mr Chair that is all I would like to say in terms of this paragraph.    Mr Chair none of these issues in this paragraph 47.2 are within my personal knowledge.    Mr Chair when the – I think I have testified to this on the Eskom stream Mr Chair not until McKinsey hadgiven us the termination letter relating to their relationship with McKinsey – or Trillian sorry.    There was a process that – of vetting that Trillian was undertaking – McKinsey was undertaking on Trillian.    That is correct.   So Sir.    Sorry – what – sorry Sir what page is it?    875 – 875?    No, no yes Sir.  It is the same one.    Ja.  I am there Sir.   Mr Chair again if we look at the paragraph in turn Mr Chair I do not know who the officials that they refer to in terms of leaving no un stone – no stone unturned to benefit Trillian I deny that was me Mr Chair.  As I have explained to you before Mr Chair.  The entire process relating to the settlement Mr Chair was relating to negotiations with McKinsey themselves.  The – where confidential information belonging to Eskom was leader toTrillian Mr Chair I deny that was me in any way, shape or form.  Personnel at Eskom were expecting to display a conduct of utmost good faith through – and act in the best interest of Eskom.  Mr Chair, I think at all relevant times, I – personally, I was conduct – I conducted myself in that regard.  When the issues relating to the MSA became apparent, as I testified in terms of the reasons for the termination of the MSA, Mr Chair, that was acting in the best interest of Eskom.  When that termination decision was made by the Steer Co, Mr Chair, I requested that Legal and the Procurement Department get engaged to ensure that the termination process is handled in a manner that is in compliance with or identified risks associated with the termination process, I mitigated them appropriately.  Mr Chair, in terms of the negotiations or final negotiations, Chair, we did obtain a final independent assessment that was conducted by Oval(?) 1(?) which indicate a certain value which was negotiated by McKinsey and was settled.  Again Mr Chair, acting in the interest of Eskom.  Lastly Mr Chair, at all relevant times Mr Chair I was – even to understand that the legal review and legal processes or legal review of this McKinsey contract wasbeing undertaken and there were no issues relating to a settlement.  And again, Mr Chair.  Just from my perspective of the sake of clarity.  Again, the legal assessment and legal aspects relating to this falls outside of purview of the office of the CEO.     No, Chair I do not have any comments.     Sorry?     Sorry, which page are you on now?     867?     Oh ...[intervenes]      876?     Yes.  Mr Chair, as I have explained previously from one of the other paragraphs, Mr Chair.  I deny the fact that I have a corrupt relationship with Mr Essa.     Well, Mr Chair, then the finding of the court,obviously, occurred without my input because I was not cited as a party to this application.     That is correct, sir.     That is correct.       That is correct, sir.     That is so.     That is correct.       [No audible reply]      That is correct.      That is correct.       That is correct.       Mr Chair, I think for context, I think Mr Myburgh at that time had started leading this evidence relating to this meeting and I think we then got into the first bit of the details of the meeting ...[intervenes]     ...which I then denied it ...[intervenes]      ...being present at that meeting.     And then I got into the reasons as to why the meeting was potentially – how can I call it – as to why I deny the meeting ever happened.     And I think at that point in time, we then adjourned for the day.    So I think we never completely traversed the reasons ...[intervenes]      ...as to why I had my denial.     But I did deny it.     [Indistinct]      Just give me one second.  My files... [Speaker moves away from microphone – unclear]     Yes, if someone ...[intervenes]      Sorry, may I just...   [Speaker moves away from microphone – unclear]     Sorry, sir.  You are at?     Yes.     [No audible reply]      That is correct, sir.     That is correct, sir.  Sorry, just a point of clarification Mr Chair.  Do you – or Mr Myburgh, do you want us to go into the detail as to why this meeting is denied because we did not really finish it now?     Only for the sake of completeness Mr Chair, we can.     Because this is obviously one of the more contentious issues in Mr Bester ’s affidavit.     Mr Chair, when I started the last time in terms of providing feedback and context in terms of this meeting Mr Chair.  As I said, I deny these meetings and I was goinginto the details as to why I deny this meeting.  And it has its nexus in the paragraphs that precede that.     And I think it is paragraphs 54 and 55, if I recall Mr Chair.  It has been sometime in terms of being able to have dealt with these matters.  But I think the issue is, and I have dealt with this in my affidavit, in my responding affidavit Mr Chair.If you look at paragraph 55.  Now you will recall Mr Chair, the nexus of this entire process was a company called DEC and Mr Reddy and how the DEC and Mr Reddy was trying to use their influences to engage with Mr Bester ’s company to be able to become a subcontractor to them.And I think that Mr Bester had testified to thefact that it was, you know, they were unscrupulous or underhanded mechanics that were happening at the time.  So notwithstanding that testimony that Mr Bester had given prior to that – this Mr Chair, he still seeks out Mr Reddy to engage with myself through purportedly resolve some unpaid invoices in terms of the project that they had undertaken at the time.And Mr Chair, at that time, Hatch was involved in, if I recall correctly, the new multi-product pipeline project and this is the pipeline project and Mr Bester is,obviously, from the Railroad Division of Hatch.  So Mr Chair, in that then – again, I am not understanding how Mr Bester gets involved in Rail – I mean in pipeline related invoices when he is a Rail - Director of Rail in the Hatch environment, but anyway.       I said curiously, on the date of the meeting, neither Sumption nor Simmer arrive at the meeting.  So it     But that is the point Mr Chair.     And that is what I am saying.  [Indistinct]     And Mr Chair, lastly.  In terms of these issues.  I deny that I was at this meeting.  I also deny the fact that Mr Essa called me.And I arrived at ...[intervenes]      That Mr Essa called.  Because it says here, in the last sentence of paragraph 57.     Yes. “I was surprised at the time that as soon as Essa called, Singh arrived a few minutes later...”     I have not arrived – I have not received any calls from Mr Essa, Mr Chair.    Mr Chair, I deny the entire contents of this paragraph.     No, Mr Chair.  To the best of my recollection Ido not think I ...[intervenes]      Other than ...[intervenes]      Let me qualify that.     Because later on in his affidavit, he does mention – I cannot recall if it is later on or it has already preceded Mr Chair, but he does mention that there were – there was a meeting that happened at Transnet offices.    That was an earlier ...[intervenes]      Yes.  But this was an earlier meeting.     But I think there is another one that comes later on.     Where I think did attend that meeting and Mr Bester was part of it.     So, if anything, Mr Chair.  I would probably have met him at that meeting.     And I think then there was – there was a cocktail function or something thereafter.     And maybe he was there and maybe I met him there.     So, but prior to that Mr Chair, I would find it difficult to understand when I would have engaged with Mr Bester.     So Mr Chair, on the available facts it is clearly a fabrication.     Mr Chair, the motives of these things, I would not know.     No, Mr Chair.     No, sir.    No, sir not that I recall.     Which two meetings?  Yes.     Yes, sir.     No, sir.     Not to my recollection.    Mr Chair, I think – again, I would not want to speculate, right.  So the proposition that you put, I would not want to look at it in the term of speculation.     I would rather take you back to what I would believe as to be the objective facts ...[intervenes]      ...relating to Mr Bester.     Mr Chair, if you look at ...[intervenes]      No, no I will ...[intervenes]      Yes.     So if you look at the entire submission of Mr Bester.  Mr Bester engages in this – firstly, he engages with the issue of Reddy and DEC and then engages with Ms Strydom and – what is the gentleman’s name?  Strydom and Basson.       Right.    In the issues relating to DEC and a subcontractor.  Now, Strydom, Basson and Bester are fully aware that they are not supposed to be doing this yet they continued doing it.  Okay?  It then comes to a point where he concludes that Reddy is a less than honourable gentleman.  On his version.  He, nonetheless, then still seeks our Reddy’s help to resolve this alleged impasse relating to the invoices that he wants resolved.  And coincidentally, then there is a meeting with Essa that has happened notwithstanding the fact that he then has this, let us say, meeting/interaction with Essa.  I think then Mr Myburgh was going to lead to the next meeting with Mr Bester and Mr Essa that excluded me. Again, I am not too sure whether it was arranged by Reddy or not but again he still proceeds with the meeting with Mr Essa.  Again, Mr Chair, you then move on.  Now you     Oh, that is correct, sir.  Sorry, yes.     But it does not retract from the fact that wedo not have confirmatory affidavits, only one of them.     That is correct, sir.     That is correct, sir.     That is correct, sir.     No, Sir, I did not know.     I would appear so.     Mr Chair, maybe if put your mind at ease, Mr Chair, the contract was not awarded for 2 billion.     Yes, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, I do not see the challenge, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair …[intervenes]     Well, Mr Chair, I think let us put the earliermeeting into context.  When I say I deny the meeting, I deny that I attended the meeting.  I would not be in a position to deny that the meeting actually happened between Mr Bester and Mr Essa.     Part of the meeting on the basis of what I have suggested.     Yes, I would not be able to do that.     Well, Mr Chair, I think in my last response to your proposition I outlined possibility as to why Mr Bester is taking the approach that he is taking.     In order to motivate why they actually ended up taking BEC as Hatch as a subcontractor where they patently knew that it was problematic or there were allegedissues with BEC and the alleged relationship that existed with Mr Essa and Mr Essa himself in terms of the allegations against Mr Essa.     Mr Chair, yes.  I my affidavit, Mr Chair, I go to some extent in terms of trying to outline the context behind this meeting.  If I take you back to the testimony I led before the Commission, Mr Chair, you will remember that I …[intervenes]     Yes, Mr Chair.     Thank you, Mr Myburgh.     Mr Chair, in terms – let me take you back to when we actually started the MEP phase 1.  MEP is manganese expansion project which is this entire affidavit of Mr Bester.  I did say, Mr Chair, at that time it was a relatively large project.  I think it was probably one of the top five projects in terms of by size in the capital expenditure programme of 300 billion which I introduced yesterday.Mr Chair, a project of this size and magnitude does and will carry an inordinate amount of risk, an execution risk relating to – from time of inception to time of completion and Mr Chair, one of the reasons that we as Transnet at the time were focusing particularly on let us call it capital expenditure and capital expenditure risks was because of the sheer size of the capital expenditure programme was 300 billion.   As I explained yesterday, Mr Chair, the MDS was a counter-cyclical investment strategy so it means we were actually investing against the demand which increased the risk quite significantly for the organisation so you needed to have a handle on risks, a real handle on risk.  So given the fact that we had history, Mr Chair, of overruns on previous locomotive purchases on the NMPP itself, theDurban dug-out port, the Transnet entrance wide – sorry, not Durban dug-out port, Mr Chair, I think the project was called the Durban entrance harbour widening project and given the fact that we are now embarking on this 300 billion programme, one of the stakeholders that were really keen on understanding how we were going to manage the programme from a risk perspective was the credit rating issue. The next stakeholders that would be interested in understanding how we were going to manage thissignificant [indistinct – dropping voice] was potentially investors that were going to fund Transnet. Now we needed to demonstrate firstly that we had learnt – or we had learnt our lessons from the past and what were we going to do differently in the future.  That would be one way to demonstrate through [indistinct] 11.01  as well as potential investors that okay, we know what we are doing. And one of the biggest issues that we encountered on the NMPP project or the new multi product pipeline project, Mr Chair, and I think I cover it in one of my affidavits but the project actually increased from I think it was 9 billion to - and I think currently it is sitting at about 30 billion, if I am not mistaken or 35 billion in terms of completion, is that the EPCM contractor is vital and themanner in which you engage the EPCM contractor, the way you engage with the EPCM contractor, the manner in which you manage the EPCM is critical to one, successful implementation of the project and when we say successful implementation of the project we are talking project on time, within budget and within schedule. Now the reason why EPCM contractors are so critical, Mr Chair, is because they become an extension of the organisation.  So Transnet does not – or Eskom does not have the personnel who actually sit on the project on aday-to-day basis to manage it, so we actually outsource that to what we call the EPCM project or the EPCM consultant. Now Hatch, Mr Chair, was one of those consultants.  So we are basically taking an MEP project, we are handing it over to Hatch and we are saying Hatch, implement this project on our behalf and you have a budget of whatever it is, let us 10 million.  So basically we are handing 10 million over the Hatch, right?   So the context of this meeting, Mr Chair, was there was – in my view there was nothing untoward about it, this meeting was basically a meeting to say guys, we have dealt with EPCM contractors in the past, we have burnt our fingers significantly and we have a live example in the NMPP.  We want do things differently on this project, wewant this project to be a success and we want it to be on time, within budget and schedule and that is what your actual function is.  And that was the context behind this meeting.  There was nothing untoward about it, it would – this meeting was, as I said, set up to outline Transnet’s expectation vis-à-vis our EPCM contractor that was appointed. Also, Mr Chair, just to highlight, in terms of - to provide context in terms of the award, Hatch could have been awarded, any other company could have beenawarded and this comment of whoever was awarded would have had the same meeting because the underlying basis for the meeting was to outline our expectations. So even it was any other – if it Orecon that was appointed, they would have also been said you were lucky to get this because our expectation is not to service us as you serviced us in the past, it is completely different.  And, Mr Chair, in my – I actually played no role in awarding this, so whether it was Hatch, whether it was Orecon, whether it was any of the other engineering companies that was awarded, it was a product of the process and the evaluation process is conducted by the evaluation team. So, Mr Chair, that is the context behind this meeting and as I said it was really a meeting where we really wanted to outline what Transnet’s expectations of ourEPCM service providers was going forward.     Mr Chair, I do not think I was critical of them, I think that is the reason why I spent an inordinate amount of time explaining the context for the meeting and the context of the meeting was to outline our expectations.    No.    Sorry, what page, Sir?     I am there, Sir.     Yes, Mr Chair.  Mr Chair, I have no recollection of this said meeting with Mr Essa and neither do I recall Mr Gama ever meeting Mr Essa in my office.  Mr Chair, you would have regard for the date being July/August 2015.  If it was August 2015, Mr Chair, I can tell you the meeting never happened because I was at Eskom at the time, then that only leaves July 2015.Mr Chair, in terms of July 2015, if the meeting did happen and on Mr Gama’s version, Mr Chair, my office isconstructed in such way that my office is let us say here and then there is an atrium and my PA sits in the atrium and then there are two – there is two additions individuals that sit in an office that is adjoined to the atrium.  So you have my office here, you have the atrium and then there are two additional offices but they are all part of one office, okay?So, Mr Chair, if this meeting did indeed happen, it will be very easy for either Ms Thakhane, who was my PA at the time, to confirm whether Mr Essa was indeed in myoffice or Mr Yusuf Mahomed, who would be sitting in that additional office or Mr Norman Mabaso, who also occupied that office to confirm that this actually happened which I categorically deny.     That is correct.     Well, Mr Chair, respectfully, I think when Mr Gama comes he can explain.  Well, he has already come, but …[intervenes]    Yes but in my view, Mr Chair, I am telling you this meeting did not happened.     No, Sir.     That is correct, Sir.     I have no reason, Mr Chair.     That is correct.     That is correct.     There is two, yes.  One or two, yes.     I would not know, Sir.     As it relates to …[intervenes]     That is correct.     I would hazard to say that Mr Gama was a high-ranking official of Transnet for a very long time, other than when he was a GCE, he was also the Chief Executive of Transnet Freight Rail for a very long time.     Yes, Sir.     Mr Chair, I have no knowledge of this saidmeeting.      Mr Chair, I testified to the fact that this meeting in my office never happened.     Yes.     That is correct.     No, Sir.  Sorry, I am saying yes, nothing of that sort happened.     Mr Chair, I have no personal knowledge of this meeting, I am not sure how I can dispute it.    I said I have no personal knowledge of this meeting, so Mr Myburgh wants me to dispute this meeting.    Well, from what I submit Chair, it is not true because the meeting that Mr Gama alleges to havehappened in my office, did not happen.  So this meeting    And Mr Chair, it is interesting to note that that paragraph 31.2 which is on page 047, Mr Gama actually had his first interaction with Mr Essa at a Regiment’s meeting.      Mr Chair, let me put it to you this way.  Mr Gama, I think you are correct Mr Chair in terms of summary that I deny the meeting that took place in October or November, emanated from the meeting that took place in my office, and as I said, to confirm whether this meeting in my office took place or not, is very easy. It is a matter of speaking to three individuals.  Okay.  In terms of the follow up meeting Mr Chair, again it is convenient for Mr Gama to say he has met with the Gupta family and he has met with Mr Essa andconveniently implicate me in terms of the person that introduced him to Mr Essa.     I agree Mr Chair.   I see that Mr Chair, and hence I am saying Mr Chair, it is convenient as you were pointing out previously to say Mr Bester alleges that he had a meeting with you and then there is a follow up meeting.  Mr Gama has a meeting where Mr Salim Essa is present and then he has a follow up meeting.  I am saying, and this is what I was trying to get to.  Is that it is very convenient for individuals like Mr Bester and Mr Gama, to after the event associate my relationship with Mr Essa, on the basis of trying to cover up stuff that they have to account for.     No, no, no.  I am not suggesting that Mr Chair.  What I am suggesting is if you look at the case of Mr Bester, I outlined to you the reason why Mr Bester would be taking the approach that he is taking, to explain the reason why he puts me at a meeting that I was not at.     No Mr Chair, but beyond that Mr Chair, I then went on to say that if you look at the reason why Mr Bester may have put me at that meeting, is to conveniently    And again Mr Chair ...[intervenes]     Again Mr Chair, Mr Gama ends up or admits going to the Saxon world reason and conveniently it is as a result of meeting with me at my office.     Well Mr Chair, you ... well, as I understand what Mr Myburgh and what you are trying to ascertain, is this meeting that happened in October flow from the meeting that happened in July, August.  So what you are trying to say is that this meeting, well what Mr Gama is saying is that had this meeting in July not happened, then the 15 October / November meeting would not have happened. I am saying it is convenient that you meet someone in the office in July and automatically in October then a meeting happens that you then attend in Saxon world.      Sorry, at my office?    I think Mr Gama would have to define which is Transnet’s offices.     Okay, that is 50 floors.     This is not within my knowledge, I cannot dispute it?  I deny that from my recollection, I do not recall Mr Essa ever being in Transnet offices.     I have never seen Mr Essa at the Carlton Centre.  I think just for the record Mr Chair.     And this is not to create an acrimonious relationship with the commission.    I would just like to place on record that we did receive a 33 notice for Mr Gama.     I said I just want to place on record that we did receive a 33 notice for Mr Gama.  But that was a    We had to request ...[intervenes]     The full affidavit of Mr Gama which was thenprovided.     And that comes to the point of Mr Myburgh in terms of us wanting to cross-examine.     Whether we would have or did not, that is besides the point.     The point if I would like to place on record that at our request then only were we provided with the fullaffidavit of Mr Gama.     Mr Chair, I think we have covered it adequately.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.    1712, that is correct.     That is correct.    That is correct.     Should I have reference to this?    Should I have reference to this?    That is correct.     I confirm that.     I think for now we will take it on face value and agree.    That is correct.     Correct.     I will take it at face value at this stage sir.      I’m there sir.     That is correct.     Thank you.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Mr Chair at this point Mr Chair the discussions that we had with the Chairperson yesterday as well as Mr Myburgh and the investigation team obviously we have now understood that the team and the Commission has access to a number of my bank statements, not only this bank statement, and Mr Chair it is concerning for meto be requested to answer this question, given the fact that you have access to these other bank statements, because these other bank statements would reflect the fact that my lifestyle was funded from those bank statements, as I testified yesterday.   The debit orders, credit cards, groceries, electricity, water, all my normal expenses would have come off those accounts.    Well again Mr Chair it is again concerning that having analysed this account in detail that you have, having access to the bank statements that we know you have that the Commission doesn’t have an answer to that question and again Mr Chair the answer to that question ...[intervenes]     No Mr Chair, it goes to the point of the fact that the Commission has these documents.     You have conducted an analysis of this account the bank statements that you have indicates that as I said to you the lifestyle was funded through those bank accounts.   Those bank accounts also reflect salary payments, long-term incentives from funds there, and this is why I am saying it is ...[intervenes]      No Mr Chair I have been employed by Transnet for over ten years.     Or 12 I think, 12 years by the time I left.     So for the period from the time I actually I think came to Johannesburg in 2003 my salary from Transnet were going into a bank account, so that’s thesource of the funds that ...[intervenes]      That is correct sir.    That is correct Mr Chair, I mean if you look at this bank statement itself Mr Chair it is testament to the fact that I had a saving culture, so similarly Mr Chair the Commission had the opportunity to analyse the bankstatements that are in their possession for a period of time, you would have come to a very quick conclusion that the money that was in those accounts emanated from Transnet, Transnet alone.     That is correct.     Sorry sir? ADV MYBURGH SC   You drew from your savings in these years?     In these years in question?   ADV MYBURGH SC   Yes.     Yes. ADV MYBURGH SC   Alright, and just so that you – that I understand it you say all of these other accounts will reflect only deposits of remuneration from Transnet, noother income?     Well Mr Chair you know you’re talking about accounts that go back quite a few  years, I am not exactly sure if there are credits that emanate from other sources, but certainly the majority of the credits that would emanate from those accounts would certainly be from my employment accounts.     Mr Chair maybe let me answer to you this way.     I think with the exactness of my responses that the Commission requires it is difficult for me to categorically state that everything single credit ...[intervenes]      In all of my bank statements emanated from remuneration from Transnet.    But what I can say to you Mr Chair is that as you said the majority of that if not 99% of them probably emanated from Transnet.  There would have been some I would assume SARS credits, some SARS refunds, some medical aid refunds if I recall, probably interest and also Mr Chair it depends on the type of account it would have been.  If it was a – how can I call it, if it was Money Market account or an investment account there would have been you know dividends or something that accrued relating to the type of investment.So Mr Chair but again as I said the analysis was done on this account, so the analysis to be done on the other accounts will be just as easy.     Mr Chair I am not too sure the period over which this is, but again depending on whether you had a credit card or a debit card or a savings accounts or a garage card or a money market account or an I don’t know,let’s call it, I don’t know what other accounts they would have had, if they allocated different account numbers to it then ja you would have had more than one account number.     Mr Chair again as I have mentioned if you have a garage card with ABSA it is an account, if you havea First Card with ABSA it is an account, if you have a debit card it would have a certain account, so it seems that that is how the banks operate, so if I had those accounts then I had those accounts.     Mr Chair that would either be the – well it would be the ABSA account and it would also be theStandard Bank.     The Standard Bank.     Ja.      The predominant credit card that I used Mr Chair was probably the Investec one.    I said the predominant credit card that I utilised was the Investec one.     Sorry?    The credit card.     If I could recall Mr Chair.     Mr Chair I wouldn’t recall offhand right now.     Mr Chair recently I would recall that I used the Investec credit card.     Credit card, yes.     Yes.     No, no sir the period that I haven’t gone into trying to find records because as I said we don’t have access to those records.     Mr Chair as I said I don’t recall how and when these payments were made, but I would recall that I probably did some internet payments and some credit card payments but they were predominantly case.     Yes.   If I recall Mr Chair.     Yes sir.     That is correct.     Probably Mr Chair but I cannot confirm.     Mr Chair I don’t ...[intervenes]     So what is the proposition that you are putting?    That is correct Mr Chair.     Yes that is correct Mr Chair.     That is correct.      That is correct.     Mr Chair in dealing with this question Mr Chair is it possible to just take a two minute recess to consult?     Thank you.     Can you just repeat the question.       Mr Chair at the time I had personal reasons to need – to have access to these funds.     Yes Mr Chair I think when we say that the accounts, this was a cheque account if I am not mistaken Mr Chair and so the interest on this account would have been very relatively low if I recall, I am just trying to check if it actually discloses interest, so Mr Chair as I have indicated there was a need for me to maintain this accountto have liquidity and at some point I was approached by the private banker at First National Bank who suggested that there is probably a better way to still have access to the funding and having liquidity and still earn interest, and that is the point in time when I then agreed to open up these Money Market account, which then resulted in the earning of interest.    No, no Mr Chair I concede because I have looked at the bank statement.     I know, I have seen that.  And I guess Mr Chair that is what prompted the private banker at FNB to suggest the opening of the Money Market.     No Mr Chair as I have said I needed to reference the bank account to actually see whether interest was actually earned on this account or not and I have – it was my impression that it was relatively interest that I was earning but in actual fact I was actually earning no interest.  So Mr Chair would be my reason.     Mr Chair I think your proposition is properly well stated, I should have said if I understood that the interest was a relatively low interest bearing I should have said my recollection was that the interest was relatively low rather than agreeing to the fact that there was no interest bearing.     That is why I had the perception that this account was a relatively low interest bearing account compared to the Money Market.     But that is the reason Mr Chair I was happy to forego the interest that I thought I was earning, which I was not earning ostensibly now, because I needed liquidity regarding cash.   So in my case, because I needed liquidity I was saying okay I am happy to forego the interest that I would get on a more longer term investment vis-a-vis the fact that I needed the money, or access to it.     Well Mr Chair that was the decision I made at the time, and it is what I did at the time.     As I told Mr Chair I actually probably paid more attention to the affairs of my professional work than my own.       That is correct.     Mr Chair in this case as I explained – I say in this case, as I explained originally, that the need to have this quantum of ...[indistinct] was for a private and confidential reason ...[intervenes]      That is correct.     That is correct.     That is fine.     Understood Mr Chair.     Sorry Mr Chair, is it possible to ask for a short recess Mr Chair.     That is more than sufficient Chair. 
MR MYBURGH SC:   And you see here that Mr Essa was really trying to muscle in on Hatch was he not, as an SD partner.     Yes, thank you.  Then perhaps whilst we are on this affidavit let me take you to paragraph 75 because you are correct, Mr Singh, you did – there was a time when you met Mr Bester and there is reference in this affidavit to I think it is a cocktail party.  That you find at page 51, paragraph 75.     Yes, thank you.  And at paragraph 75,     Yes, I will find it whilst Mr Singh is [indistinct – dropping voice]     Well, that is the context but did you say these things, that they were lucky to have been awarded the contract and did you make – were you critical of them?     Yes.  Well, did you say these things, did you say they were very lucky?     DCJ, you asked for the reference to the affidavit.  You will recall that Mr Singh has filed a series of affidavits, five different affidavits.  He deals with Mr Henk Bester in his first affidavit and that you find in bundle 5B at page 445.  I do not intend to take you through it, I just simply bring it to the attention of the DCJ.     From paragraphs 42 onwards.     Page 445 through to page 451.     But these are things that we had gonethrough, Mr Singh, before.  I am not going to re-traverse that.   What I would like to do then is to take you to Mr Gama’s evidence.  If I could ask you please to pull out EXHIBIT BB28.     Thank you.     We are now in a different exhibit, EXHIBIT BB28, Mr Gama’s exhibit.     It is in a different file, your registrar will give it to you.     And could you please turn up page 48?  Are you there?     Page 48.     Paragraph 31.3.   “In or during July/August 2015…” Says Mr Gama. “…I needed to discuss a work-related issue withAnoj Singh, the then Chief Financial Officer of Transnet.  Singh’s office was in close proximity to mine and I walked to his office and observed (through a clear glass partition) in boardroom together with Singh.I entered the office …[intervenes]     Sorry, I beg your pardon, together with Essa.   “I entered the office and had a very brief discussionwith Singh and as I left Essa indicated to me that he was desirous of having a meeting with me.  Without giving much thought to the request, I responded that he could obtain my contact details from Singh.” Do you want to comment on that?     Just so that I understand your evidence, when you say you have no knowledge or recollection, you are not saying you cannot remember, you are saying this did not happen, you categorically deny that it happened.     So Mr Gama also just gets it all wrong?     Yes, he has already come.     You did not …[intervenes]     Ja, sorry, you also did not apply to cross-examine Mr Gama.      So at this time Mr Gama was the Acting GEC of Transnet.     And you were his CFO?     Now Mr Gama’s version or evidence about the fact that Mr Essa said I am desirous of meeting with you and without giving much thought, as he said, youresponded and said he could obtain my contact details from Singh.  That you knew to be Mr Essa’s modus operandi, did you not?  He was desirous of meeting you, he sought you out and he had meetings with you, correct?     So that is how Mr Essa operated?     No but I am asking you, is that not exactly what he did in relation to you, he knew …[intervenes]    Just if you bear with me?  He knew you to be a high-ranking official at Transnet, seems he sought you out, he sought to make contact with you and meet with you.  He did that, did he not?     And he then does the same with Mr Gama because of course now Mr Gama is a very high-ranking official, he is acting as the GCE of Transnet, correct?     But this is Mr Essa’s modus operandi,is it not, to try and make contact – close contact with high-ranking officials.     Well, the factual basis is what happened with Mr Singh and I thought I had made that clear.  Perhaps I can re-traverse that ground.  Mr Singh…     It is your own evidence, as I understand, you must correct me if I am wrong, that you had two meetings with Mr Essa.  He contacted you.  Your evidence is not that you contacted him so on two occasionswhen you were Chief Financial Officer he makes contact with you.  He asks for meetings with you and during those meetings he, I think you said, explored potential business opportunities.  So I am simply putting to you that Mr Gama’s version of what Mr Essa said to him accords with your interaction with Mr Essa.     Perhaps I could just fast forward.  What then happened, I do not assume you can dispute this, is that Mr Essa then did invite Mr Gama to a meeting.  Can you dispute that?     Mr Gama’s version is that that invite arose from the interaction in your office.     Yes and then going back to the invitation, Mr Essa does invite him to a meeting, probably seen Mr Gama, he gets the address and as things turn out it is the Saxonwold compound of the Guptas.  The meeting takes place there.  I do not suppose you can dispute that?     No ...[intervenes]
