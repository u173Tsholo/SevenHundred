CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Moyane had acted maliciously.  It was not clear to me whether Mr Gordhan intended to allege or alleged in his affidavit that Mr Moyane had acted maliciously in laying those charges against him.I stated in that judgment that in due course I would issue directions on the way forward.  The Chairperson’s directions.  Subsequent to the delivery of my judgment I issued directions with regard to the outstanding issue.  The relevant parts of the directions read and I quote.1. Mr Gordhan must deliver to the commission and serve on Mr Monyane on or before Wednesday 15 May 2019 a short clarificatory affidavit in which he clarifies whether in stating in his statement of 11 October 2018 that Mr Monyane acted malicious in laying charges against him and others. He meant –    I think we will take a short break and then resume to hear the evidence of today’s witness.    Is that in order?    Okay.    Okay.  So how much time do you think we should - /15 minutes?    15 minutes?    Okay.  Well let us make it - it is about 13 minutespast 10.  Let us make it half past 10.    We adjourn.    Yes Mr Pretorius are you ready?    Why is PP4 not part of PP1?    Yes, but you say those it consists of additional documents that relate to PP1?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Well why are they not made part of PP1, that’s my question.    Because they are only relevant to PP1?    Is it possible to change that or is that ...[intervenes]     It may be that since it’s been done it might be difficult, I am just having a look whether it would – all that would be needed is to change the pagination, maybe if the last page of Mr Shaik’s statement is for example page 20 then those other documents could come after page 20 and be marked 20A, 20B and so on.    Yes, yes.    Oh they are not relevant only to Mr Shaik’s statement?    Because that is what I understood you to say.   Maybe – and they are not referred to in his statement?    Okay, then maybe it’s fine, we can leave them as they are, I think it’s simply because you said or I understood you to say they are – they belong to Mr Shaik’s statement but if they are relevant for all the witnesses then they can stay as PP4.    Okay no that’s fine.    The file containing the statements of Mr Rieaz Shaik, Mr Njenje and Mr Maqetuka will be admitted as EXHIBIT PP and Mr Shaik’s statement will be admitted as PP1, Mr Njenje’s statement as PP2, Mr Maqetuka’s statement as PP3 and certain additional documents at the end of the bundle as PP4.  Yes?    Before we do that I don’t know whether counsel on awatch and brief would like to go on record or he is fine without going on record.    Ja, okay.   Let him place himself on record.      Thank you, the former Minister of – I get confused about security and intelligence ...[intervenes]     Ja, okay, alright, thank you.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    I guess a long time ago?    Yes.    Okay.    Thank you.    Thank you very much Mr Shaik, before we proceed I just want to say that I appreciate the fact that you have made yourself available to come and share what you know with the Commission, as you probably know from last year I have been calling for former DG’s and current DG’s, former DDG’s and senior officials in various government departments and in municipalities senior officials to come forward if they know matters that fall within the terms of reference of the Commission and there have been times when I have expressed theview that although a number of them have come forward and we appreciate that I do feel that there must be many out there who know quite a lot who haven’t come forward.Indeed when the Reverend Chikane was here giving evidence last week we had a discussion about that and he gave me his perspective but I want you to know that we appreciate when senior officials who were – who have knowledge of some of the things that really are important for the Commission come forward to help the Commission understand what was happening, so I just want you to know that we appreciate that you came.    Thank you.    Just one second Mr Shaik, I wonder if you can bring the mic just a little bit closer, ja, that’s better.    Minister Cwele at that time was already Minister of Intelligence.    Yes, it is just as I said I get confused about Intelligence and Internal Security, so Intelligence is the right title?    Yes, it is just that I think at a certain time certain terms were used.     Then at another time they got changed.    And I don’t know whether at some stage there was some kind of splitting of parts of the same, what was the same before.    So that is why sometimes it is ...[intervenes]     That is why sometimes those of us who are not very familiar with those operations get confused.   Yes thank you.   Yes, that is interesting, ja.    I am sorry, I must have missed something, you don’t mean that you were sitting in the holding room and then led to a press conference and that was announced without any discussion as yet?   I must have missed something.    Oh, so it was just a brief ...[intervenes]     Yes, okay, okay, thank you.    I’m sorry, I’m sorry Mr Pretorius.  I think you need to explain something with regard to the pagination, I just realised at leastwith regard to P4 that it seems that its paginated is a kind of a standalone pagination and not sequential from the beginning, we normally have pagination that goes from the first page to the last in the bundle, but if this is different I think it is necessary to explain that into the record, but also so that I understand.    Well PP4 it says, it starts from page 1 to whatever, but there’s a page – oh that’s just an index that comes before that, so that’s so from page 1 up to – what is the last page?    Yes, okay.  I think deal with the others as well, page – so PP1 has its own pagination, PP1 starts from page 1 to page 15.    Is it 16?    Well I don’t have 16, and I don’t have the stamp, but it’s not – there’s not supposed to be a stamp of the Commissioner of Oaths because it’s not an affidavit so how come you have ...[intervenes]    Oh, well that compounds my problem because the witness didn’t do an oath this morning, he didn’t take an oath it was an affirmation so when I looked at this and said it is a statement, not an affidavit that was – that accorded with him not taking an oath and doing an affirmation.    Well all I’m saying is – well not all, but part of what I am saying is certainly what I have for Mr Shaik is reflected on page 1 as his statement, statement of Rieaz Shaik and at the beginning it does not say as affidavits normally do “I hereby make oath and say”, it startsthe story “I was an anti-apartheid student activist” and at the end of the – that statement goes up to page 15 and there is no Commissioner of Oaths certificate as one would have, so I do not mind being given what is to be used, I just want to make sure we have the same things, I do not know whether he has an affidavit or he has a statement like I do, but we must have all the same thing.    Yes.    Well if you are happy that we use a statement I am happy I just want to make sure we have the same thing.    Yes.    Yes, so that the transcript does not talk about an affidavit and then here it is a statement.    Ja, okay, alright.      Mr Shaik do you understand what’s going on?    Ja.    Yes okay.    Yes, yes, okay.    So if both of you have affidavits, maybe if there is a spare affidavit I should just have an affidavit then we all have the same thing.  I assume the numbering is the same?    Ja.    Yes, it does not have to be stapled because it will just go in here as is.  Thank you.    Yes okay, thank you.   I guess it will be necessary for me to have a copy of the constitution.    Or the relevant portions.    Oh okay, no that’s fine.    Okay.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius – oh you are at 39 of PP4   Okay.    Ja okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Well Mr – Mr Pretorius before we get there I just want to make sure that I understand the differences in functions of thedifferent units or agencies.  National Intelligence Agency you say that deals with what?    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.   So counterintelligence would be what the NIA does to deal with for example people planning to overthrow the government?    Yes that kind of thing.    But unless – unless…   Serious.  They would be less serious things that they would deal with as well?    Ja.  Ja.  Ja.  But I mean part of what they would look – part of what they would be concerned with be crime and how would they – how would their function differ from Crime Intelligence?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   So – so the – the South African Secret Service which I think you said deals with International or Foreign side of Intelligence – so they could be involved in monitoring the movement of Nyaope from Afghanistan or wherever and for example get to know that it is destined for our shores.    And then they could then share that information with the NIA so that when it lands on our shores the NIA is ready to deal with it?   Yes.   And then when the NIA deals with it it could end up with Crime Intelligence and ultimately with SAPS and – in the courts?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  But…    But I just want to understand ja.    Yes. Yes.    The information.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay so – so Crime Intelligence I think I understand this other Secret Service from what the examples that we have just used.   But Crime Intelligence from what you say it looks like in the examples that we have used would – would not – would only get involved after NIA had been involved.  In terms of those examples. But in terms of other crimes it could act as an intelligence unit or first instance if you – if you understand what I mean?    Yes.    Hm bombings.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Hm. And the Military Intelligence really would relate to who – who wants to attack us or as a country or what?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm. Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Well I know that I – I just said that I take it that Military Intelligence is about intelligence relating to who wants to attack us.    But – which is rather from outside the borders of the country.  But now if we want to know – or the President wants to know whether within the country there is a group of people who are planningto go to the headquarters of the SANDF and kidnap the general …    Ja and other senior military leaders and go on radio and television and say, we have taken over the government of South Africa. If he wants to know whether there are people within the country who would be expected to pick up that kind of intelligence or is it all of them?  Or would the Military Intelligence be expected to pick that up themselves?    Yes.   Yes.  Okay, no that – that is alright.  So – so the Military Intelligence is outward looking?    And the – the NIA is inward looking?    South African Secret Service outward looking and Crime Intelligence inward looking too.    Inward and outward.   And military outward looking.    Okay.  Thank you very much.  I think I understand better now.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    I am sorry.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Am I missing something on this organogram because I do not seem to see the Minister ofIntelligence?  I see Minister of Justice, Minister of Police, Minister of Defence, Intelligence Coordinator reporting directly to the President.    Have I –     I am not missing anything?    Oh.    Will explain okay, alright?  Well that – that came fromthe fact that I thought the Minister would report to the President but then there is a coordinator.  Okay, alright, thank you.    We can take the short adjournment now or we can take it half past ten- half past eleven.  We did start at half past eleven.  In terms of what you want to cover does it matter?    Oh.  So it is…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So maybe it is better that we adjourn – take the tea adjournment and then continue.    After that.  Okay alright.  We will take the tea adjournment now it is twenty past eleven we will resume at twenty five to twelve.    We adjourn.   Yes.  Let us proceed.    Hm.    Well Mr Pretorius I think it is - it is convenient that before we proceed I - I see the structure in the Interim Constitution to the extent that what you say is how it was reflected in the Constitution. Obviously the administrative power of the Minister of Justice maybe might not be …    In the Constitution, but I would like to see that and then see how even the final Constitution is structured before we proceed, because then I think I will understand some of the explanations that you give better.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.  No.  That is fine.  Let us - let us do that.  Even if we just look at simply the structure to say look at this.  Here are the main features.  This is not there.  This is there.  This is what this might mean …   And then later on we can go back if necessary.  Do we also have in here relevant parts of the Interim Constitution or not?    The final?    Ja, but there was no difference.  Do you know?    Were the same?  Final Constitutional    Oh.  Okay.  Alright.  So where do I find the relevant parts of the Constitution … (intervenes)?    Page 42?   Yes.    And just for the record what we are looking at now is Chapter 11 of the Final Constitution?    Okay.    The reference to the State as opposed to the reference to a particular Government of the day?    Might - might - would it be pursuing the security of the State as opposed to the security of a particular Government of the day.  To what extent would it be different from human security insofar if it is done properly?    Hm.    I - I kind of qualify my question by saying if those who are supposed - who are responsible for State Security do their job properly.  What I had in mind is there would be no State without people?    And the State must look after its people?   And therefore whether one cannot say even if you speak of State Security if the understanding is the correct understanding would it not lead to those people looking after the citizens properly as well?    Yes.    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and - and I guess - I guess that it may have been necessary to put it that way.  Even if it was an option to put it as State Security on the understanding that after 1994 State Security would be seen as including the security of the people.    It may have been necessary to put it that way in orderto emphasise what was not emphasised before.    Yes.  Okay.    Thank you.    1974.  Yes.    Hm.    I see that the Constitution is emphatic that in terms of the Defence Force it is a single Defence Force.  In terms of the Police it is a single Police Service, but it does not have that emphasis for Intelligence Service.  Is that - is that in accordance with what the …    Discussions were?    Yes.    Okay.  Thank you.    Well was there actually a slight qualification in - in the reason for it.  Namely not - not that you did not want any member of the Security Services to say I did not know the law, because that might be fine when it cannot be said that you must have known this was illegal.    So in other words on the probabilities that what you wanted to do is to prevent people from carrying out manifestly illegal orders, because even when they saw - realised that this order is illegal.  They could say well if I am instructed by the Commander …    If I am instructed by somebody occupying that position …    What can I do?   So they know it is illegal, but because of where the order comes from they might say I had no choice.    You wanted them to - you wanted to say once the order is manifestly illegal you cannot say because it came from somebody in a particular position.    You could not do it …    But where you in good faith did not think there was anything illegal with the order then you stand in a different place all together …    But where it is manifestly legal.  That is what you wanted to deal with.    Ja.  Okay.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.   No.  Thank you.    I guess that the provisions of Section 1-9-9-(7)-(a) and (b) well they talk about a party, but you just referred to a situation where some people in a party might …    Be wanting to unsit the President of that party and as you - you say as long as they do - do it legally and constitutionally you know Intelligence Services should have no business to be involved there.    So this provides a basis does it not for any member of the Intelligence Services who would engage in any conduct to advance the interest of any particular political party that he or she would be acting in breach of this and possibly the relevant legislation as well. That - that should be none of their business as long as it is done within the principles of democracy and within the confines of the law.     Yes and if it happens it’s just a breach of theseconstitutional provisions and whatever may be in legislation.     This talks about a party and doesn’t talk about an individual, maybe when we go to the legislation there might be individuals as well, I’m not sure.  So if I am the head of Military Intelligence or maybe I’m not the head of Military Intelligence, if I am a possible candidate for head of Military Intelligence and I want to be appointed as head of Military Intelligence can I say to the President, I assume Mr President who appoints the head of Military Intelligence, is that so?     No, okay maybe it’s a wrong…[intervenes].     Oh okay maybe NIA, if I say to the President you know if I get appointed as head of NIA I will look after you or anythinglike that or I will make sure that A, B, C, D does happen which will be in your favour, that’s clearly wrong.     And clearly in breach of some legislation.     Yes okay.     Well I’m hoping that as we continue at some stage we will talk more about those things because you know it’s often said about our country that it’s got the right constitution, it’s got the right legislation, it’s got the right policies but things go horribly wrong with implementation and one of the things that I have publically said many times before that I believe should be looked at by this Commission is the question of whether, as a member of parliament who belongs to a particular political party when you are supposed to perform your duties there, including duties that may relate to votes of no confidence and impeachment and so on, can your party say to you irrespective of what you think is right or wrong, this is how you must vote and what do you do if your party says – let’s say your party says vote in this way but youbelieve that, that’s not in accordance with the constitution you believe that holding the executive accountable means that you must vote differently but it is your party that has sent your name to parliament what do you do.  It raises the same question in a certain way that you have touched on to say when you are in intelligence you are not supposed to be advancing the interests of any political party you are supposed to be just doing your job.  You, in accordance with the constitution, and the law but there may be expectations.  Take yourself as – with your background in the ANC and struggle there may be expectations from certain people, your comrades who were in thetrenches with you who think, okay now that we have got him there so he will have to remember that he comes from us, he’s one of us he must remember even maybe that we put him there and therefore they might have certain expectations which might not accord with what the constitution says and what the law says and to what extent do these situations which give rise to these challenges, to what extent have they had a role to play in putting our country where it is now in relation to levels of corruption, in relation to allegations of State Capture and so on.  So it becomes important because maybe in certain circumstances people feel torn between acting in a certain way and acting in a certain way and it may be that some of those things need to be looked at.  So I just give you that context so that you may understand why I’m saying in regard to what you said, we might need later on to deal with it and let me have the benefit of your views on it.     Thank you.     Before that and maybe what you are referring to is an answer.  I haven’t looked at the constitution before the President, after elections, announces his or her Cabinet all the Executive power is – rests in him or her.     And then when he or she has announced the Cabinet – members of the Cabinet then effectively he gives powers to various Ministers to deal with various things because there is legislation thatsays what the Minister of this and that will do but what I’m not sure about is the reference here to a member of the Cabinet is supposed to exclude the President because, otherwise normally I would  imagine that the Cabinet – the President is part of the Cabinet but he is the one who puts it together but I may be mistaken in that regard maybe the Cabinet are the Ministers and he is simply referred to as President, is that something that you have applied your mind to?  I’m raising it simply because the reference to a member of the Cabinet, immediately suggests they are talking about a Minister but if the President is also a member of the Cabinet then technically it might not have the significance that I may have thought it has because if the President is a member of the Cabinet then there’s always a member of the Cabinet who is responsible for all of these – you might or might not be able to say something, I’m just asking…[intervenes].     I guess what is possible is that in the constitution – I think in the constitution there is a section which says who the Cabinet is and I suspect it includes the President but what the difference – what may be important is that whenever the constitution intends to refer to the President maybe it uses President and therefor maybe – whenever it says member of Cabinet it refers to a Minister maybe – I don’t know whether also Deputy President but Deputy Ministers are not members of Cabinet as I understand the position.  So maybe whenever it says member of Cabinet it means a Minister.     When it intends to refer to the President maybe it always says President, I don’t know if Mr Pretorius has found something…[intervenes].     Okay, no that’s fine.  Probably the answer may well be that when issues intended to include the President in a particular function the constitution refers to the President and when it intends to – intends Minister it says member of Cabinet responsible for Police orfor Health and that kind of thing.  It might not be particularly significant but I just noted it in the context of Mr Shaik’s evidence.     Oh okay so there’s specific provision.     Yes well I just see in Section 91(1) in theconstitution that actually the President is part of the Cabinet because it says,“The Cabinet consists of the President as head of theCabinet, deputy President and Ministers”.So it seems that Cabinet includes the President but maybe that the answer lies in what I said earlier on that maybe when specific provisions or functions are allocated to the President, maybe it refers to the President but at least the one thing we know is that Cabinet does include the President.     Okay.     So he has a choice or discretion in relation to Security Secret Services or Intelligence.     But he has no choice on Police and Defence.     Ja so you have two diametrically opposed approaches, the one approach in relation to the Police and the Defence is that in effect the President must never take – assume responsibility of either of those in regard to Intelligence Services – if I say Secret Services is that still fine?     Okay in regard to that there is a preference as you put it for the President to be the one who takes that responsibility butthere’s an acknowledgement that he has a lot of responsibilities and he might prefer that a member of – somebody else must be responsible, then in that case he’s directed to designate a member of Cabinet to take that responsibility?     Okay thank you, yes Mr Pretorius?     The provisions of the constitution that we have been looking at are those of the final constitution.  Earlier on we had some discussion, I was asking about the interim constitution and as I understood the position it was that the principles in the final constitution were the same as those in the interim constitution.  I’m wondering whether that is correct now, now that here it does contemplate the possibility that a member of Cabinet may beresponsible for Intelligence or whether what was meant was, under the interim constitution it was the same principles but the President at that time had elected not to designate a Minister for Intelligence despite the fact that constitutionally he could have done so but what may have happened since then is that the successive Presidents have elected to always designate a Minister for Intelligence that is why, therefore,  between 1994 and 1997 the organogram didn’t reflect any Minister responsible for Intelligence Services but if you look at any organogram that might be applicable from a certain year till  now you will always see that there is a Minister.  So in other words, what I’m looking at iswhether the interim constitution also gave the President the same choice because this one does and the only reason why there was no Minister – there’s no Minister in that organogram for 1994 to 1997 responsible for Intelligence is that the President at the time had elected not to assign a Minister for Intelligence whereas after that, various Presidents assigned a Minister.  Am I causing you any confusion?     Yes, no that’s fine, I think what was important for me is to just go back to the question which I had asked, whether the interim constitution and the final constitution was the same on this issue and I think you are saying to the best of your knowledge it may have been the same.     But we’ll need to check just so that one is sure about it. It may be that in the end it’s neither here nor there but I think it’s important to appreciate whatever differences there may have been over the years in relation to Intelligence particularly when there may be suspicions and allegations of Intelligence Services being misused and abused.    I just ask that you ask your members of the legal team who are assisting you if they can get me the relevant portion of the interim Constitution during the lunch break.    Ja we could ja.    Yes okay.    Was Doctor?    Oh okay.    Yes there was also the then Advocate Skweyiya I wanted…    Yes.    Yes.    I am sorry the Intelligence Oversight Committee mentioned there.    Was that the Parliamentary?    Oh.    Because I have just written here Parliamentary to make sure it is clear that it is Parliament – a committee of Parliament.    Yes.    And then the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee was not a Parliamentary Committee?    Yes.  So…    So I think that is why because they are on – more on the same level what I see here but there is – there are certainly different colours.    And Intelligence Oversight Committee reports to Parliament and the Inspector General reports to Parliament.  So – but I have just put in Parliamentary Intelligence Oversight Committee for my own purposes just to understand that – that is a committee of Parliament.  Okay.    I will say nothing.    Maybe before you do that Mr Shaik.  Under this organogram or maybe as would be the case subsequently.  Effectively the various units under Secret Services that we looked at when we were looking at the first organogram those – all of those units effectively now are represented under those red boxes at the bottom of this one – all reporting to the Minister?   Okay. Okay.    State Security.    Can we go back to the Provision of the Constitution that makes the point that only in terms of National Legislation – what was that section?    209[1].  Well I think the ordinary understanding is that National Legislation means legislation passed by Parliament.    And if that understanding is correct then the establishment of any such service in – by way of anything other thanNational Legislation passed by Parliament then – unless there is something that you and I do not know then it would appear that it might not have been in line with this.  Okay, alright.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.  Hm.  Hm.  And of course the – there would have been a particular rationale behind that kind of provision to say, only by way of National Legislation.  There is an emphasis you cannot do it in any other way.  It must only be the President and it can only be – even if it is him but it can only be in terms of National Legislation.    And that is…    It – it – in other words maybe the rationale mighthave been and you can talk more about at some stage if it is necessary but the idea must have been that if it is legislation if it is established in terms of National Legislation that has been passed by Parliament then it will be acceptable to Parliament which is the representatives of the people of South Africa.  It would be acceptable to them but also then the issue of oversight I guess comes in?  Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Ja okay.   And that cannot really be good because there should be a sharing of information and…nd that cannot really be good because there should be a sharing of information and…   And so on.      Yes let us take the lunch adjournment.  We will resume at two o’clock.    We adjourn.    Okay.  Let us proceed.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Let me have a copy.   Yes.    Okay.  So we could replace this maybe tomorrow morning with one that …    Ja.  Okay.    Ja.  Okay.  Thank you.    Had you been part of the discussions that led to the proclamation or did that - did those discussions happen while you were out of Government service and you came in when those had either advanced too far or had been completed?    Yes.    Thank you.    Well you - you indicate that the name might not be important, but we - we do know that in certain circumstances the label might not be important, but in others it can be important.  The name can be important, because it is part of what is conveyed to people who have conduct or get to know about that institution or that office and if the name or the label does not represent what is intended. It could give a wrong perception about what the - the institution or the office is about.  So - so maybe you should not be too apologetic about pointing the significance as far as you are concerned of the difference between what was intended in 1994 and what is represented - what is represented by the proclamation in the change of the name of this institution.    Okay.   I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  You know Mr Shaik what you are saying about the change could well be very important.  Maybe when one or if one gets to understand from those who - who were involved in the discussions and who - who can articulate the rationale.  Maybe it is not so important.I am not sure, but you - I see that in your statement paragraph 12 you say that you were never able to determine the motive or rationale for - I think - the change.    You know and yet I would have expected that because of the seniority of the position you held yourself and particularly because of your prior involvement in the discussions leading to 1994 in regard to Intelligence.  I would have expected that you would know because if you ask you would be told what was the rationale, but am I to read that whatever attempts you may have made to try and find out why is that - is there a departure from what we envisage that you - you were not giving any clear answer.    Am I to understand that that is the position?    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Well it is just important for a number of reasons, but part of what some of us - some of us - the people wonder about.  Is sometimes where it is the same Government - it might have a different President at a particular time, but it is the Government of the same ruling party and one Minister goes another one comes in and there are so many changes. That it is as if it is a Minister from a new - a different party who has come in and sometimes not easy to understand.  Why?  You know, because you would have thought that the policies and certain things and principles that are being followed are the same, butsometimes that happens. I mean you may or may not know I - I am hearing evidence in regard to the digital migration as well and I was part of the panel in the Constitutional Court which had that case and over a number of years stretching over 10 years you could see there was no real progress being made on these desk - these …    Ja.  Set top boxes.  Set top boxes and a new Minister would come and he would say this is the way we are going and then later on another one would come and say this is the way we are going and at the same time you would be having reports in the media that the policy position of the ruling party is different from what the Minister is - is doing.  So - so that is why I am …    Saying one would have expected that somebody assenior as yourself …    Would have been given information as to what is the rationale for a change from what had been what - what all of you had been comfortable with from 1994.    Ja.  Okay.    Hm.    Thank you.    I - I just like hearing different perspectives, because whether I agree with them or not they may be beneficial in knowing about them.    Well you know one - one might not be able to be categorical, but if you are asking me about something and I am confident that it - it is the right thing to do and I do not have a reason to mistrust you.  It is something that I can - I should - I can tell you and I believe it is a sound basis for my decisions. I would think that the normal thing is if you are ask, tell you.  This is why we have changed.  This is our experience.  You might agree or you might not agree, but I - I will not hide from you …    What the reasoning behind it is, but of course if I know that the reason - the real reason behind it is not a legitimate one.  I might not want to be transparent to you about it.  Ja.  Okay.    Of course another example where it might be if you know that I am going to be appointed Minister of Finance.  You know it in advance.  Even if you do not know it as certain.  Maybe you know it as a probability and you do not want that to happen.  You can use whatever information you have maybe to discredit me before the decision is made.    Is that right as well?    That is what can happen?    Ja.  Thank you.    Two things.  One, of course even when you report directly to the President and there is no intervening Minister there may be occasions when the Intelligence you pick points to the President himself.    In certain circumstances.    Maybe - you might know better.  Maybe it is not something usual with Presidents around the world.  Maybe it is something that does happen, but - but of course the point you are making is you want to reduce to the absolute minimum …    Situations of conflict.    So you want to go to the ultimate office, but you alsomade the point that the Minister does not direct the operations of Intelligence.  Now when you say that how differently - how different is that from other portfolios with regard to the Minister and their DGs.  Normally one understands that Ministers will not get involved in operational matters. The - they will be dealing with policies and then the DG will be dealing with operational matters, but I guess there may be many cases where maybe the distinction is difficult to identify, but I just want to understand whether when you say that.  Namely the Minister of Intelligence would not or should not be dealing with direct - should notbe directing the operations. Whether you are simply reflecting what is something that this - that applies to other departments as well or you are articulating something that is peculiar to Intelligence?    Is your evidence therefore to the effect that even in a case where there is no intervening Minister, there is no Minister of Intelligence and the Head of Intelligence reports directly to the President is your evidence to the effect that in that situation the directing of the operations resides with the Head of the Intelligence and not the President?    Yes, so that is how it should be and that is how at least maybe it was at a certain stage in South Africa.    Yes, okay, alright.    You are now talking about ...[intervenes]     The Nineties, okay, okay, ja, thank you.    Maybe before – I am sorry again Mr Pretorius, maybe before that let me ask this question.  You have told me how you – in your view this situation should be in terms of reporting and what – how it was originally after 94, and you did say the Minister of Justice wasgiven the possibility of administrative matters in relation to Intelligence and not directing operations.  Once there was a Minister of Intelligence, as you understood the structure that is now even before we talk about what happened in reality, was your understanding with the Minister being – with that being a Minister of Intelligence he or she might involved in directing operations by virtue as being there as opposed to the President or it wouldn’t necessarily mean that he or she would be involved with directing operations that could still be left to the director, to the head, but it would just depend maybe on the person, on the incumbent?   But are you therefore saying that you could have a Minister of Intelligence without necessarily implying that he or she would direct operations?    Ja, so in principle you could have the Minister ...[intervenes]     But when it comes to operational matters he or she could not be involved there.    Yes, yes.    Okay thank you.    Mr Pretorius we are taking long on this but I think it is very important for the understanding, you know I certainly appreciateall the explanations that I am getting in terms of intelligence.    Yes that evidence ja.    Ja.    Just articulate what the form of the form of the protection was, maybe I missed that, just – I know I think it’s in your statement.    Oh please, please, remember I am not – so where we ask you questions that might compromise those things please just remind me.    We are not too used to those things but too used to transparency so if ever I ask you anything question and you feel that it might require you to give information that you shouldn’t give because of the – because it belongs to Intelligence please feel free to let me know, so if you – if it is not something you can indicate, I was just thinking maybe police officers who – and so on, but I leave it to you to ...[intervenes]     So this is now post the conviction?    Oh during the trial.    Ja.    Yes, you may continue.    I’m sorry again Mr Pretorius.  What you have notsaid, and I don’t know whether that’s because of anything connected with Intelligence, what you haven’t said is what was the response of Mr Cwele to the news that you had decided to terminate this support.  Is that something you can say?    Okay, okay one of the other witnesses might have.    Okay, okay.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius, well to those who are not close to Intelligence and Secret Services, those of us who are not close to those, to Intelligence it might not have been as apparent as it now seems to me and others who are listening to your evidence what this could mean if it meant that the Gupta Brothers or one of them was ableto overhear sensitive information emanating from somebody in the Presidency or from the President, because today it might have been about the appointment of so and so as a Minister but tomorrow it might have been information about something that really goes to the security of the country.    So it was quite something, quite serious even from that angle leaving out the others?    Hmm, hmm, hmm, no I think that scenario is the one that has been dealt with quite extensively in the public domain.    Of course the – any President who gets an inappropriate suggestion like that would respond in the only way that is appropriate for this situation but of course you could have various people you know who may innocuously at one stage or another say tothe President you know what Mr Shaik would be good for the police you know, you know maybe next time you think about reshuffling the Cabinet think about him, you know, here is his track record, as long as the President doesn’t feel bound to do that I would imagine that that’s not a problem, is that right?    Well that’s quite important, but maybe your – you use in your evidence the word suggestion, maybe it should be something much  more than suggestion because a suggestion implies that it’s just an idea you know but maybe if it became something more than a suggestion maybe even an instruction you know that maybe that’s where the problem becomes even ...[intervenes]    ...more difficult because my friends might make suggestions about certain things in my company or in my department as minister but you know as long as they are just suggestions and nothing more I don’t feel bound and those people don’t think that they can dictate to me what I do that might be fine.   The problem might be where the suggestion is no longer a suggestion, it is an instruction or where the President, whoever it may be in that situation may feel bound to give effect to the suggestion because of whatever.    But part of the importance of what you say about what you think the rationale must have been for them to then go to the person to be appointed to demonstrate that they had the knowledge.    May well link with what Mr Ramathlodi said in this Commission when he gave evidence about, and expressed his views about the Waterkloof landing because, and I remember it because last week I dealt with when Minister Nkoana-Mashabane was here was that he was saying that landing as far as he was concerned wasn’t just a landing of that aircraft, it was the Gupta family showing the whole country and the world that they might not be President but they land where Presidents land, in other words they were in charge.  I hope I am not misrepresenting but that’s how I understood Mr Ramathlodi’s evidence to be to say they were telling everybody we are in charge, so when you then say if they get knowledge by whatever means that thePresident intends to appoint so and so as Minister and then they go to that person to share that information it may be that you are right that the motive is a very wrong one.    What’s the word?    Yes.     Well that is quite important but I am looking at other evidence and that part of the – what I have got to do is not look atevidence in isolation.  I have got to look at all the evidence and where there are links.  You know – link – link them.  I have heard evidence where – of course I mean the public knows about the evidence of Mr Jonas which was to the effect that he was taken to a meeting at the Gupta residence and that the – Mr Duduzane Zuma was there when a Gupta brother, one of the Gupta brothers said they wanted to make him Minister of Finance and said Minister Nene would be – would be dropped from cabinet or dismissed whatever the term was that they used and that he was – they wanted him to be the new Minister.  And it seems that you would be talking about the same thing to say maybethey wanted – if he accepted they wanted to make sure that when he became Minister of Finance he would remember that…    They made him Minister of Finance.    And therefore he would feel some loyalty towards them.    And there would be some dependence because if they made him Minister they could unmake him Minister.  They could have him dismissed.    So – so one has that and then of course you have other situations where somebody who is in a certain position like Mr Saloojee of Denel at a certain stage was brought I think by Mr Essa Iam not sure to a meeting I think at the Gupta residence and at one of the meetings Minister Gigaba who was Minister of Public Enterprises I think was there.  He was brought at the time but according to the evidence not much happened but apparently he did say something like I hope you people can work well, or something like that I cannot remember.  But also you have an occasion when Mr Saloojee was brought into a meeting at the Gupta residence and Mr Duduzane Zuma was – was present but there is not much according to the evidence that he said but he was present.    And then you have Mr Dukwana former MEC in the Free State Government who was taken to the Gupta residence and according to him at least on one of the occasions Mr Duduzane Zuma was there but not much – he did not say much there.  So one does not know whether even the presence of Mr Duduzane Zuma at some of these meetings where certain people are brought in was meant to convey the message – a certain message to the people.  So I was just mentioning.    Because I thought what you said might be linked to those – to those scenarios.    Ja.  Yes thank you.    I am sorry Mr Shaik.  Just to close off the issue relating to the newspaper article.    Which talked about Mr Mbalula having been informed of his pending appointment by the Gupta brothers.    You – you have not told me – you said you decided to investigate but you have not told me about what happened.  Is that because it is a sensitive – it is an intelligence matter because otherwise we lawyers want to close all gaps.  We want to hear the whole story  So I say somebody reading the transcript would say, he said they investigated, the decided to investigate and what happened and nobody asked what happened?      Yes.    To which you will come.    Okay so at some stage you will be able to either tell me what happened to that investigation.    Or to tell me.   For certain intelligence reasons.    You might not be able to tell me.    Yes.    I am…    Now which year was this?  I do not think your statement specifies.    2011?  Okay.  You would not remember what month and so on or [indistinct].    Ja okay.    Okay.  Okay.    We – that is before we get to the actual content of the discussion ne?    Yes.  Okay.    No, no that is fine I will …    I just want to say I know it happened a long time ago but the more you are able to tell me about the details of the discussion and the tone the better so I get as good a picture of how the meeting was as you have.    Mabanga or Mabanga?  I am just...    I am just thinking of surnames along those lines.    You will check ja okay.    Yes.    And what was his position?    Which fell under you?  Which fell under you for instance?    Yes.    But the other did agree to leave?    ja.    How – how did he know about it – about the decisionto investigate had Ambassador Maqetuka told him or how had that – because you said you had just made the decision before.  Or is me showing my ignorance about intelligence.    Yes.    Officially?    Oh.    Okay.  So he asked – he wanted to be told.    About this decision?    And you saying Ambassador Maqetuka took him through.    Hm    Hm.    Well if somebody – if you – if you come to know that the police or any official agency of the state is conducting some investigation and you may be the subject of the investigation and you know that they will find nothing.  I wonder why you would say stop the investigation.  You may or may not be able to comment on this but I am trying to understand why if the senior – [indistinct] senior management of intelligence take a decision such as this on the face of it in good faith to do their job why anybody could say, stop it if as far as they know the investigation will find that nobody did anything wrong or particular people did not do anything wrong.  Because if you say it mustbe stopped you leave a question mark about the – the person or persons who were to be investigated.  But if you allow it to continue and he finds out that it clears them then the whole thing is buried.    But you – you might be able to say something?  You have done a lot of investigations I am sure.    They might no coincide    Yes.  Continue.    Right.    So was the only reason that the Minister advanced for saying that the investigation should be stopped that it was an investigation intended to benefit Mr Njenje or it was driven by him whatever he said?  Is that the only reason he gave or are there other reasons that you – that he gave because I would like to know if there were other reasons and hear and be able to assess their validity.    Of course if he did not believe what was being alleged and now investigation was done and it turned out that he was wrong in not believing what was alleged the consequences could – could be and could have been disastrous.  So is the position not thathe ought to have sought to air on the side of caution and say, well I do not believe it but if these three senior people who have experience a lot of experience in intelligence believe there should be an investigation I should leave it to them.  Because if they find out that there is no problem then it is fine.      Well that is - that is quite important Mr Shaik and it goes back to an issue I raised with you much earlier.  Well I mentioned to you.  Namely - you must tell me if I think I mentioned, but I did not mention it.  Namely I talked about I think the role of parliamentary - Parliament in terms of its oversight obligations, but I did not refer to oversight obligations, but what I was about …    Is part of oversight.  Namely about the votes of no confidence and so and so on.    So one of the things that I believe I will have to look into if I come to the conclusion that yes there was State Capture or something that should not have happened and - and that happened.  I may have to say how did it happen.  Who are the possible role playerswho could have prevented it from happening and what mechanisms were in place that could have been used to prevent it from happening? Were those mechanisms used effectively and hence one could look at Parliament’s performance of its oversight obligations in regard to when did they start suspecting State Capture.  What did they do about it?  The same thing when it comes to the levels of corruption in the country and all of that.  What did they do? What are they doing when they - what do they do when they execute their oversight obligations.  So you - you say here.  Here we were from the Intelligence Community being Senior Managers having ameeting with the Minister.  We had made a decision that this could pose a National Security issue and should be investigated. We decided to investigate it, but here is a Minister of Intelligence to whom we - we report who says no.  It should not happen …    And you say - with the benefit of hindsight you say well looking at what subsequently happened …    Indeed …    There is a chance that - if we had been allowed to conduct our investigations there is chance that maybe we could have come up with recommendations or that could have prevented it from happening or even if it did not prevent it completely, but maybe it mighthave been limited and not as - have gone as far …    As it did.  So - so I am just saying that what you are saying is quite important, because it throws …    Also on that, because to the extent that there - there was State Capture and so on.  We need to know where did we go wrong.  Who was supposed to do what?  Who did not do their job and if they had done their job could we have been here …    And so on.  So that is quite important.    Well that is - that is quite important, but it touches upon something that I raised with Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabanelast week who was here to give her side of the story to say why she recommended to the then President that Mr - Mr Koloane be made Ambassador after what had happened and his role in the Waterkloof landing. Being known insofar as he had confessed to certain things and made certain admissions.  Of course as we all know there is the question of whether the President at the time knew about this or did not know about it.  Of course Mr Koloane had told certain officials in Waterkloof that - that in effect the President knew or that he had been told by one or other Minister that he knew and wanted this to happen.Of course later on he said no that - that was just him lying and so on and so on.  So - but we are dealing with the matter on the - on the basis that assuming that the President did not know and assume that Mr Koloane was right.  That this was his whole idea …    But how could you then get the same guy promoted …    And you yourself say the appointment as an Ambassador is an honour and you say yourself that you knew before you made the recommendation that this person had admitted to lying about this.  Something as important as this and you accept that the person did not have integrity.  You accept that to be an Ambassador you must have integrity.  How could you …    Then go to the President and recommend that thesame person should be made President.  That is what we were discussing and I raised the issue about values.  You know.  You say - you know - Minister have got to take responsibility.  I mean you would know that you know some people would take responsibility and will say leave - leave my junior staff and whatever.  I made this decision.  I take responsibility.  I accept whatever criticism.    As opposed to those who want to come in only when there is credit …    And shift out of line.    Move out of line when there are problems and then push junior officials forward to say they must take responsibility.  So I - I certainly believe that accountability is critical in our democracy and that it starts with being able to stand up for what you believe is right and if you believe what you stand for is right. You say this is what I believe.  If you get persuaded differently.  Then you say now I have changed my mind, because I have been persuaded otherwise, but the question - the question of senior leaders hiding behind junior officials.  I think is unfortunate.  So I understand what you mean and …    I think people must take responsibility for their own roles in whatever.  Mr Pretorius.   Is this - is this now around 2011?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.   Just repeat.    I - I thought at some stage during the meeting the way you are describing it.  There must have been quite some heat in the meeting.  So later on it was cold.    Hm.    Are you done with the meeting or if you are still …?    Okay.    Ja.  No.  That is fine.    That was the outstanding question?    Ja.    Ja.  Do that, because that is what I …    I had in mind.  Ja.    As contained in his statement.    You - you said as testified to.    Ja.    Hm.  Well did you put a question or you are still looking for …?    Oh.  Okay.    Ja.  Ja.  Okay.  Somebody must (indistinct).  Both counsel are sitting this side.  One of them must sit this side.  So you can help.  One of you must be that side.  So you can help with - if - if the witness needs to be assisted.  It is much better if there is somebody this side.    I - I thought - I thought …   I thought the lead - the leader of the - of the team can direct how the members of the team - where the members sit.    Chair.    Well he might need a few minutes to have a look if he has not seen it before.    Ja.  Just - just have a look.    Well I am - I am sorry.  That might be important because you thought it took about an hour or so.    Yes.    Oh, after the meeting?    Oh.    Oh, before the meeting.    Oh.  So …    So from the time you arrived …    To the time you left it might have been beyond midnight whatever.    But the actual discussion may have been about an hour or so?    About two hours?    Okay.    Hm.    Ja.    Well the - there might be significance in establishing whether he was giving an instruction or he was saying this must stop.  With a view to giving instructions or whether he was simply expressing a view that was contrary to the view of the three of you and saying he thought there was no need for it for whatever reason. So I do not know whether Ambassador Maqetuka may be seeking to make a distinction when he says he does not remember or recall the Minister gave an instruction.  Whether he means whatever he may have said he did not view as an instruction …    But he may have expressed his views which were to the effect that he was against you continuing with the investigation, but maybe he views them - he viewed them as nothing than - more than theMinister’s views.  So I do not know whether that is the - that is the angle, but I emphasise it to you for purposes of you being able to say whether as far as you - your recollection is concerned you are quite clear that the Minister was saying stop this thing.  As opposing to just giving …    His own views or whether he was giving his - his views and nothing more.    So to the extent that there might be a debate about whether what he said amounted to an instruction - verbal instruction …    As opposed to a written instruction to the extent that there might be a debate about that.  Maybe in terms of your version andAmbassador Maqetuka’s version is it possible that what you - what there should be no debate about as far as you are concerned among the three of you is that the Minister sought to put a lot of pressure on the three of you to stop the investigation.    There should be no debate about that?    There should be no debate about that?    Yes.  Yes.   Ja.  Throughout it was quite clear he was putting a lot of pressure?    Yes.  Whether you say that amounted to an instruction or not.    It might be another thing, but he was putting a lot of pressure and all three of you should - should probably agree on that?    Okay.  Thank you.    Well to the extent that you might not have given methe details I am going to ask for I would like them because it may be difficult to make a determination between putting pressure in a meeting putting pressure to stop the investigation and expressing view which were contrary to the three of you but doing so firmly, so you said that the meeting was confrontational and there’s some things that you can remember that so and so said this or did this, you know you might not  have the bending of the table or anything like that, but I just want to get that picture if you are able to remember you know somebody, how this was, how the confrontational condition, the atmosphere of the meeting manifested itself in terms of the discussion, in terms of the interaction.    And in the course of the discussion did he mention, if you are able to remember, that this investigation should be stopped or anything like that, I think effectively that’s what you he his stance was but I am wondering what terminology he was using.    Yes, yes.    Yes.   Yes.   So, but the issue that the Minister did not have the authority to stop the investigation that you raised as the three, you raised with him.    Yes and either says that you wouldn’t raise it unless you believed he was trying to stop the investigation?    Yes, yes.    Okay, thank you.    Yes, ja.    There is no doubt about that.    Ja.   Mr Pretorius I see we are at nine minutes past four, from my side if it is fine with everybody we can continue and try and finish with him, I don’t know what your situation is, I don’t know what Mr Shaik’s situation is.   How long do you think we need for him to finish?   In the end we must do justice to the matter, so that isimportant, but – well while you are looking maybe Mr Shaik if we continue for another 30, 40, 45 minutes, maybe up to an hour to finish would that suit you?    That will be fine from your side.    Yes, no I am – if the arrangement was that if we don’t finish he is available tomorrow we can continue tomorrow that is fine, but I just thought that since we have got two other witnesses it may be that it is better to finish with his evidence today, but I am not rigid.    Ja.    Ja, no that is fine.    I am easy, that is fine, I didn’t expect we would go beyond five o’clock but as you say you know more than I do now theremay be other matters that you want to raise.  I am quite happy that we go up to five o’clock and then if we don’t finish then subject to his availability tomorrow he can ...[intervenes]     If we don’t finish by five o’clock would you be available tomorrow morning to finish?    You would make arrangements?    Yes okay alright, let us continue then.   Or maybe we should take a little bit of – a ten minutes break.    And then – is ten minutes fine?   Okay, let’s – well it is about twelve minutes past.  I will just say let us come back at twenty five past.    Ja ,twenty five past.   We adjourn.    Okay let us proceed.   Well earlier on I wondered whether there was something in the choice of the word fear.  Why should it be a fear but you are – you are actually expressing.    What you understood to be his position.    Minister ja.  Okay.    Would there not have been a way if there was any legitimate concern about a possible conflict of interest attaching to Mr Njenje?  Would it not have been possible for the investigation to be continued without Mr Njenje being involved himself in the investigation?  Or was the problem that he was head of the very branch or unit that would do the investigation?    Yes.    Hm.    Yes. Thank you.    Did you say Richard Mdluli Report?    Okay.    Well I – I am not – I do not think I have heard of a Richard Mdluli Report.    So – yes.    Oh I remember that part from the media.    But not from the – yes.    Yes ja.    Yes.    That is now Ambassador Maqetuka when you…    He initiated the investigation.    So – I am sorry.  So there is what the public would have read in the newspapers?    About a gathering of some ANC people in New Castle.    Or Escort I cannot remember.   Plotting to unseat – I do not know whether the former President or – but plotting some things.    You say that – those media articles were based on what you refer to as the Mdluli Report    Oh, oh.    Oh.  But where the newspapers got their stories you do not know?    Ja but there was Mdluli Report that talked about that meeting.    And that report was directed to whom?    To the President.    Yes.    Okay, okay ja you may continue.    Sorry just to make sure we are on the same page.  What was the gist of that report as you – as you?    Zuma.  Okay alright.    Continue.   Okay I know I was interrupting you.  So Ambassador Maqetuka initiated an investigation to establish the veracity of the Mdluli Report?    Ja claims in the Mdluli Report and the result of that investigation was a report from yourself – from your – from Intelligence?    Which was then submitted to the Minister – Minister of Intelligence and ultimately to the President.    Yes okay continue.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So from what you said it appears that your report must have – must have been critical of the claims made in the Mdluli Report?    Yes.  And the President was then saying he and the Minister of Intelligence were persuaded by the Mdluli Report rather than by your report?    Okay.    Thank you.     And all three of you and you must tell me if this is not something you can say?  All three of you were agreed that your report was the correct report?    Yes okay.    So – so it must have been quite something is it not for – to have a situation where the – the President rejects a report that three of the most senior people in the intelligence accept to the correct report.  It must have been quite something to the three of you or not really?    Yes.    And I guess – I guess it is one thing if it is a report byone person.    One of you. I think the – the one thing that makes it worse is that it is – as far as you are concerned all three of you say this is the right position.    And for that to be rejected by the President would be quite something.    Ja okay.    Well I do not know how Crime Intelligence ranks when compared to the Intelligence branches that the three of you were dealing with or is two and then the Head.    Two - two units.  You, Mr Maqetuka and Mr Njenje.    I am just trying to remember whether there were three units.  No.  I think there were two units.    The internal and the external?    And then Mr Maqetuka was the Head of a combination of the two?    Ja.  I - I take it that Crime Intelligence was quite important.  Maybe might not have been at the same level as the Intelligence or Secret - State Security Department that Mr Maqetuka was heading.    Those were two …    Different.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Hm.   SAPS?    Hm.    Hm and - and of course there is not just one …    Person at the level of Director-General.  It is three …    Senior officials.    Who are at that level as …  As well and the department thatAmbassador Maqetuka was heading and the department from which all three of you came or the department you were serving different units - two different units.  Was the one that effectively specialises on Intelligence?    Crime Intelligence is just part of Intelligence generally.  So - so this was not just a case of the President not agreeing with your report, but also it was a question of him not agreeing with your report in preference to what - what other report?    So - so if it was - your report was standing along maybe it might have been one thing, but it was a comparison.    So I can imagine that you must have felt - all three of you must have being - felt quite bad.    Yes.    Yes.    In the ANC?    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Questioned?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Just going back to the meeting with him.  Am I right tounderstand that there was a big difference between the atmosphere under which your meeting with the President was conducted compared to the atmosphere which prevailed at the meeting you had with the Minister. The one with the Minister having been very confrontational and the one with the President seemingly from what you say having been very civil and polite.  Am I right?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    So - so would it be correct to say it was a meeting where both sides were listening to each other?  They might not have agreed, but they were listening to each other - to each other’s points ofview or is that not a proper description?    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Did he raise this issue of Mr Njenje’s conflict of interest or business interest that …    The Minister had raised?    He did not raise that issue?    So was the position that as far as you could see he gave you this long explanation that he gave you, because he wantedyou to be persuaded that there was no need for - for the investigation.  Is that how - how you would see it?    How you saw - you said you saw it.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    So - so the one thing you are clear about.  He did not say stop the investigation?    Ja.  The second thing you are clear about.  He tooktime to explain his relationship with the Guptas and so on and so on and three, it was quite clear that he was against the continuation of the investigation.    His view was against it?    It was against it.  Ja.    Ja.  Did not think it was.    Yes.    And what he knew.    Yes and then you say he then put in this bid that as I understand it.  You must tell me if I am not understanding your evidence correctly.  He then put in this little bit that was too the effect that there are people who - there were people who wanted to topple him. Was - was your impression from the discussion and from what he was saying that if the three of you were to push and say - assuming you could - were to push and say we want to continue.  You - he might see you as part of people who wanted to topple him or what.    Yes.   Yes, but you also said the discussion was such that although he did not say you three were a part of that, but you felt some ...[intervenes]     You felt some impression that he might not have been sure that you are not of it or something like that.    Yes.   Hm.    Yes.  Yes.  Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Of whatever agenda.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay.  Going back to the issue of who directs the operations of …    Intelligence.  You said that the Minister should not …    Be doing that.  At some stage we talked about the Head of the Intelligence being the one doing that, but at some stage maybe - maybe two times or so you talked about - you talked in a manner that made me believe that it would be within the prerogative of the President to direct operations …    Of - of Intelligence.  Is that correct?    Yes.   Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So - no that is - that is fine.  I think that people like you who have experience and knowledge of the Intelligence need to show sufficient interest in the work of the Commission and the recommendations that the Commission could make, because you being the experts in the area.It would be important that when the Commission looks at recommendations or invites - I mean submissions that some - some of the people who have expertise and experience.  Could make some submissions to say the Commission should consider the following possible recommendations that could assist in the future with regard to Intelligence. So - so - but going back to your meeting with the President.  So - so your understanding would therefore be that once the President - once it is clear from what the President says that he is not approving the pursuit of a certain investigation.  Since ultimately the power todirect the operations of Intelligence verse in him.  You - you would have no choice but to accept that situation?    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    No.    Yes.  Should we start a little earlier tomorrow? Maybe.    Because Wednesday is another witness.    At 10.    Ja.    Ja and - and you think you will manage or you say you will cross the bridge when you come to it?    Not to do justice.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.  So okay.  We will - we will start at 10 tomorrow and then see how it goes, but before we adjourn I just want to put this question and maybe you do not have an answer to it.  Do - do you know from the point of you - of Intelligence what should happenwhen the Intelligence branch has got information that needs to be - that has got an issue that needs to be investigated or people that need - need to be investigated, but the Head of the Intelligence or the Minister of Intelligence or the President is conflicted.  Well I am - I am asking all three because …    It could be different.  Do you know what the position would be with the - at that time Ambassador Maqetuka if there was something and maybe a friend of his seems to be investigated.  What would he - would he deal with that situation?  Would he take part in making any decisions or would he disclose or would he not be part of it and then …    You can deal with the Minister as well.  Although you might have dealt with and then I come to the President.   Yes.    Well - well there is enough time for us to ponder over the issue to the extent that it is relevant, but there - I think there is a provision in the Constitution which if I recall correctly is along the lines that when the President is conflicted.  I do not know whether it simply says he is not available to - to perform a certain duty the Deputy President should perform the duty. Now it maybe that I do not know if it is around 2-0-9 or 190. It may be that there might be debates if it says not available.  There might be debates about whether or not that would encompass a situation.  No.  It is not 2-0-9. Maybe 190.  Whether it would encompass a situation where physically the President is available, but maybe legally he is not available to perform the duty, because he should not do so, because he is conflicted.    Is it Section 90?    Yes.  Do you want to read it Mr Pretorius?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  I think - I think that is the one I had in mind.  So one of the scenarios is where it says where the President is otherwise unable to fulfil the duties.  There may be an argument that it caters for a situation where he is physically available …    But …   For some reason …    Unavailable.    Maybe because he is conflicted.  Maybe because of some other reason there maybe, but also I think the ethics - Executive Ethics Act if I am not mistaken maybe having something about …    Or maybe even the Constitution maybe having something to say Members of the Executive should not act in circumstances where they are conflicted, but we do not need to look at it now.  So I - I was just thinking whether in that kind of situation whether he should have dealt with the matter himself or he should have let somebody else deal with it, but …   We - we might look at it closer to the time of the recommendations and the debates and submissions.    Hm.    Yes.    Okay.  No.  Thank you.  Thank - thank you very much.  We will adjourn for today and we will start at normal time tomorrow - 10 am.  So we leave it at that.  We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS:  Noted.  Thank you Chair.   Yes Chair.    We need to just put some more documents in your witness file.    Relating to certain matters that will be raised by the first witness.  If we may do so.    15 minutes.    Yes.  Yes.    Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair.  The first witness today is Mr Rieaz Shaik, better known as Mo Shaik.  Before he takes the affirmation may I just point out that on your desk or on your benchChair is a new bundle, PP1 to PP4.  PP1 contains the statement of Mr Shaik and PP4 contains certain documents relevant to that statement, PP2 and PP3 are the statements of further witnesses to testify today and tomorrow.     PP4 is in that bundle, it has just been put in there.     PP1 is the statement of Mr Shaik.     PP2 and PP3 are the statements of the further witnesses to testify today and tomorrow.     PP4 contains certain additional documents relevant to PP1 that have just been placed in the file.    They could be, they could by, but ...[intervenes]      Yes it is just an administrative issue that had to be dealt with because the documents were paginated, PP1 to PP3 were paginated so when PP4 came along the pagination required them to be placed at the end.  That is the reason.     We can change it, it is not a problem Chair, we can– it is just the page number that is ...[intervenes]      That could be done, and we can do that Chair.     There is one other qualification in that the documents in PP4 are relevant to all the witnesses because all the witnesses deal with the same subject matter for these proceedings at least.     Not only.    No.     Yes Chair, just by way of clarification further these statements were taken and recorded some time ago, since then it was felt by the Legal Team that further matters should be dealt with, of ageneral nature and of a specific nature, because the subject matter relates to all three witnesses, the fourth section of the bundle would rally logically apply to all of them.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair, may I just by way of introduction refer to a few matters relevant to the evidence of the witness.  The three witnesses to give evidence today and tomorrow will deal with the activities of security officials.     Perhaps he should.     As I was saying Chair the witnesses who will testify today and tomorrow will deal with the activities of certain security officials, relevant to the terms of reference of the Commission.  The first witness as we have stated is Mr Shaik.     But in addition by virtue of the knowledge and experience of Mr Shaik in the security intelligence field he is able to assist the Commission firstly to understand the various constitutional structures which deal with the intelligence function dictated by the Constitution and the relationship between them.  He is also able to assist the Commission to highlight and explain the relevant Constitutional provisions, obviously not to interpret and apply them,that is clearly the function of the Court and to the extent that you need to do so Chair yourself, but to explain generally the standards of conduct required by the Constitution of security entities and operatives about which there will be substantive – substantial evidence in addition in 2020 and that will be the first part of the Mr Shaik’s evidence.    33 Notices have been issued, the statements as I have said ...[intervenes]      Yes, acceptably Chair.       The 33 Notices have been issued, the statements as you will have noted are very brief and it will be necessary to expand on them but not in a way which detracts from the procedural requirements.     May the witness take the affirmation?     Mr Shaik you have in front of you a bundle marked PP1, in that bundle at pages 1 to 15 is an affidavit, is that your affidavit?    At page 15 whose signature appears there?     And are you satisfied that the contents of this affidavit are true and correct?     At page 1 from paragraphs 1 to 9 you tell the Commission some of the matters related to your knowledge and experience and your personal background, would you just go through those and tell the Chair of your own background please?    During the period from – or prior to 1994 and during the period up to 2009 did you have occasion to work with the former President Zuma?     And we will deal with some facts in relation to evidence that the former President has given in due course.  In paragraph 10 you describe the fact that you were reappointed into the security establishment, together with two other persons who are to give evidence today and tomorrow, tell the Chair about that please?     We hope to deal with that satisfactorily in a moment.     Yes, thank you.     If we may take a step out of your statement or affidavit for the moment and go to EXHIBIT PP4 and Tab 5 contains certain diagrams and an extract from the Constitution.     If I may then Chair just note for the record that EXHIBIT PP4 which contains certain documents relevant to the evidence to be given is paginated from page 1 to page 47.  I do note too that the initials RS appear form page 39 onwards, but perhaps it would be better Chair if the initials RS were excluded from references and from the final copy to be corrected.     47 Chair.    Page 16 Chair.     Yes.  16 is just the stamp of the Commissioner of Oaths.     No it is an affidavit Chair and if your file has not been updated I apologise, the statement has been replaced by an affidavit.     Well Chair the fact is that the statement or affidavit before you was sworn before a Commissioner of Oaths, I am not sure whether it was affirmed at all.     Can I explain Chair?     As I explained to you earlier the statements were taken some time ago, as a precaution I asked the investigators to haveit sworn, which was done.  My understanding is that you have the statement in your file, so your problem does not exist yet, it is only when the affidavit is filed, so perhaps we will just leave it as that.     Yes, they are identical documents.     So for the purposes of the evidence which is given under affirmation any way perhaps we can proceed on the basis of the document in your file.     Yes I will talk about a statement.     Happy Mr Shaik?    The numbering is the same as I understand it.     Well perhaps you could put this in your file please Chair.     And I will now refer to the paragraphs in the affidavit that you have in front of you.     That is what Mr Shaik has and that is what I have, and I apologise for the fact that it should have been on your file.  Just by way of introduction to the documents after Tab 5 in EXHIBIT PP4 Mr Shaik you have told the Chair that you were involved in the drafting of Chapter 11 of the Constitution.     And you will obviously understand that once the drafter has released the written section or chapter for promulgation that is the end of the story as far as the drafters are concerned, thereafter it is up to the Courts to apply and interpret.    Nevertheless you can assist us by pointing out not only the various structures to which the DCJ has referred, but you can also highlight some portions of the Constitution and explain the thinking at least behind them, subject to the fact that you cannot interpret.     If you go please to ...[intervenes]      Yes, you have in PP4 ...[intervenes]      Chapter 11 yes.     Page 42 and following.    There is an organogram at EXHIBIT PP4, page 39, do you see it?     That is followed by an unnumbered A3 version of that page which is easier to refer to.  That I understand it is the organogram that applies to the Intelligent Services under the constitution for the period 1994 to 1997.    Yes 39    It is followed by a larger copy.    Which is easier to – to read Chair so I – I would suggest that you go to the page after page 39 and you will see an A3 version of page 39.  Chair it is intended to put these up on the screen but in the meanwhile we can deal with the organogram.    At page 39.    In red along the bottom of the diagram are certain entities dealing with intelligence, what are they?    If you would pause there a moment.  Is the Act the Intelligence Services Act 38 of 1994?    And that is the Act referred to on the right hand side of those four blocks?    Right.  That created four entities, what are those entities if you could just go through them again please?    Right.    Okay.  The next one?    And then the next is Crime Intelligence?    And the final one is Military Intelligence?    Right.  You will see that above the National Intelligence Agency which you say deals with domestic intelligence and counter intelligence and the South African Secret Service which deals with foreign intelligence a reporting line to the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee, what is that?    That was a civil cooperation bureau?    Okay.    Thank you.    We will deal with the reporting lines.    And oversight.    In addition.    Chair.  But before we do that these four entities that you have referred to share joint services as I understand itincluding technological services like interception, monitoring and the like?    Okay.  And those and other joint services such as training and the like, internal security in other words the security of the operatives and the entities are to an extent as you have explainedshared services?    Alright.  And you have explained that Crime Intelligence and Military Intelligence may request certain…    Technological assistance from National Intelligence Agency and the South African Secret Service?    Alright.  You have told the Chair that these entitiesreport for coordination and cooperation to the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee.    And it seems from the diagram that you explained that that committee reports to an intelligence coordinator who in turn reports to the President?    Yes.    Yes sure.    Okay.  The Crime Intelligence resorts under the South African Police Service reporting in turn to the Minister of Police?    And Military Intelligence resorts under the South African National Defence Force under the direction of the Minister of Defence?    Alright.  For oversight purposes in other words oversight over the…    Activities…    Yes.    Mr Shaik will explain that.    Chair I see it is eleven twenty I am not sure when you want to take the short adjournment?    Well it will take some time to go through these because there are two more diagrams to go through.    This is the situation to 1997.  It changed in 1997.    And changed once again in 2009.    It is very confusing.   So it is quite important to.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Shaik we will see in the diagrams to follow that indeed there is a Minister responsible for Intelligence - two different designations over time, but would you explain to the Chair please why on this organogram - 1994 to 1997 - there is no Minister that appears to be directly related to Intelligence.    We will get there.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes Chair.  We had intended to go through Chapter11 in some detail.  So if we may do that …    And some of the concerns or questions you have raised will be answered in that process.    Then we can go back to the diagrams.    Yes.    We do not.  We just deal with the - chapter 11 of the …    Final Constitution.    The - the principles to which the …    Witness now refers are in the Final Constitution.    Page 42.    Of PP4.    I would like to deal with the governing principles because in 198D there is important provision in relation to the structures.    Yes.    There are certain governing principles that wereestablished in the Constitution in relation to Chapter 11 Security Services.  What are those provisions and I would like to put all those on record through you Mr Shaik particularly 198D?    Or a particular Government?    Or particular officials within Government?    198B Mr Shaik deals with the issue of armed conflict both within the borders and internationally.    The principle in relation to what one may term extra or constitutional armed force.  What does this principle say about that?   And what does the section say for president purposes - for present purposes in relation to the employment of armed conflict within South Africa.   Yes.    For example.  The arming of certain groups in order to attain certain objects within South Africa.    Yes.    Then C and D in particular perhaps you could explain 198D in relation to the oversight responsibilities in relation to the operations and perhaps to expenditure in relation to security entities.    There may be further questions when we revert to the diagram …    In relation to detail of the structure, but for themoment would you please deal with Section 1-9-9 of the Final Constitution which deals with the establishment structuring and conduct of Security Services.    Yes.    And then from 1-9-9-(2) onwards.    And I understand that subsections 1-9-9-(5) and 1-9-9-(6) are informed again by our history?   Chair if I may just say at this stage this detail as you appreciate obviously is important, because it informs the constitutional standard against which the conduct which will be given in evidence or testified to in evidence over a period of time in the Commission must be judged.  Subsection 1-9-9-(7) is also instructive.    Can you explain that please?         Mr Shaik section 1998 importantly deals with principles of transparency and particularly for the evidence to be led in due course before the Commission, accountability.  What has section 1998 provided, what was the thinking behind it?     Please I think it’s important.     Yes if I may just emphasise the must it’s not optional.     Yes and that would include oversight over expenditure?     Before we go to section 209 and to section 210 which deal specifically with Intelligence, you will recall earlier this morning the issue of a responsible Cabinet Minister or a responsiblePresident arose in relation to the Defence Force Police and Intelligence Services and in that respect you were about to refer to section 2011 in relation to Defence and 2061 in relation to Policing.     Perhaps it’s appropriate to go to 2091 to highlight the differences.     Chair chapter five deals with the President and National Executive, Section 84 deals with certain powers and functionsof the President in his capacity as President or her capacity as President and Section 85 deals with the Executive Authority of the Republic which is also vested in the President but exercised together with other members of Cabinet.  Now that is at a high and general level and may not answer specific questions directly but those are the two sections.     Yes what is instructive to is Section 91 which deals with the Cabinet and affords the President the power to appoint and assign powers and functions to Ministers but it gives – 91(1), 2 and 3 but what is instructive about  the sections to which Mr Shaik is now referring is that there is a specific provision in the constitution in relation to Police and in relation to Defence which stipulates that there must be a Minister and stipulates their powers at a constitutional level rather than at a level of the discretion of the President.     Yes and I think that is the point he was making.     And importantly Mr Shaik in contrast to those two sections to which you’ve just referred dealing with the member of Cabinet being responsible for Defence and a member of Cabinet being responsible for Policing together with certain other obligations, do you have Section 209(1) and (2) which differ fundamentally in principle from those two sections in relation to the powers of the President as concerns Intelligence Services.  Perhaps you could just read 209 (1) and (2) and then explain please?     Yes we’re about to do so but perhaps for the sake of completeness we should just deal briefly with oversight provided for in Section 210, you’ve already referred to Section 210 but let’s deal with it nevertheless.     And approved by resolution.     So whatever Presidential and Ministerial powersexist in the constitution it is quite clear that there must be parliamentary oversight.     Through specific mechanisms provided for by parliament.     Could we go back to the diagrams, unless there’s any further questions you want to raise Chair?     It does – the question is obviously one that is reflected in the diagrams but not explained in the diagrams and I’m sure Mr Shaik can deal with it now.    Yes indeed Chair.  The only observation for the present is that as I understand the interim Constitution it dealt with these matters in very general terms whereas the final Constitution isfar more specific in relation to powers and duties.    And we could print it and put it up too.    Is that being done?    Thank you Chair.  Can we go back then to the first organogram dealing with the period 1994 to 1997 and would you justdeal please with the reporting lines to the President through the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee on the one hand and the oversight duties of Parliament, the Inspector General of Intelligence and the Intelligence Oversight Committee on the left hand side of that diagram please?  So two issues, reporting through to the President and Parliamentary Oversight.    And then oversight please?    Then if we can go RS40 or not RS40 but page 40 of Exhibit PP4.  We have an Intelligence organogram for the period 1997 to 2009.  What changed and how was that change brought about?    In addition Parliament had oversight functions.    The oversight functions of Parliament remained?    Yes thank you Chair.  Perhaps blue is the wrong colour for Parliament.  At the – at the…    At the bottom of the page you have in red just to be fair Chair a number of other bodies.  It seems that there were some organisational change at the time.   Could you just please briefly describe the various entities that had developed administratively or organisationally at that time?    And then on page 41 of Exhibit PP4 you have yet another series of structures and reporting lines.  Again please if you would explain to the Chair what changed and how was that change brought about?  And you mention particularly your thoughts about a proclamation being used.    State Security.    Under the auspices of a Director General?    And as you have pointed out Chair fundamental to this issue which we will research just to see that we have not missed something along the way is the Constitutional role of Parliament and its fulfilment of that role.      And perhaps even the usurping of that role but that is subject to our researches.    Mr Shaik if you look at this diagram dealing with the period 2010 to 2019 it does not reflect the Military situation but I presume that is the same?  It goes through the Minister of Defence?    With the Intelligence function?    What is important to perhaps to emphasise is the ongoing accountability of Crime Intelligence under the auspices of the South African Police Services still subject to the oversight of the Inspector General of Intelligence and indeed Parliament?   And then if one goes to the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee and the Intelligence Coordinator that remains the same but now reporting.    To the Minister of State Security as he is now named or she is now named?    But what you have emphasised is that a single organisational entity the State Security Agency was formed with its two branches domestic and foreign?    And it does not allow any particular intelligence agency or part of an intelligence agency to go off on a frolic of its own as it were.    So you will touch on that later in your evidence.    But the two important principles as I understand you have emphasised are 1 coordination and 2 oversight and control.    Chair it is one o’clock is it convenient to take the long adjournment?    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Over the long adjournment we had occasion to obtain relevant portions of the Interim Constitution and although it needs to be checked I am able to say at the moment that it deals very sparsely and in very general terms with Internal Security which is a function in the Interim Constitution under the South African Police Service and then in the constitutional principles deals with    Certainly of the nature in the Final Constitution.    If - if you …    Would like a copy now …    Of the relevant sections.  We have not copied all of it …    But we will do so after checking.    Yes.  It will be replaced tomorrow morning.    Properly paginated.    Mr Shaik at paragraph 10 of your statement on page 3 of the bundle - PP1.  You refer as you referred earlier to your appointment and the appointment of your two colleagues?    And you say in paragraph 11   You refer in paragraph 11 to different organisational structures.  What are those?  That is before the change.    It was for training?    Yes.  Then Mr Shaik you refer to briefly and in passing this morning to a significant principle in the changes.  It seems that prior to 2009 to 2011 the various Intelligence structures were separated organisationally?    And after the changes in 2009 to 2011 as in thepast they had become consolidated once more.  Is that correct?    Is there anything significant in that?    And coordinate.  Separate but coordinate?    Yes.    Yes.  I am sorry for interrupting.  Yes you were saying.    You were tasked however with the implementation of the outcome of those discussions as I understand it.    Ja and then in paragraph 12 you express as you have expressed earlier your doubts about the constitutionality of this new arrangement that you were mandated to give effect to.    What were those doubts?    Yes and you have referred to the structural implications of the changes as well?    You deal in paragraph 13 with the reporting lines that you were obliged to follow on your appointed.        Mr Shaik throughout the sittings of the Commission the Chair has expressed an interest in the views and opinions of various people who have had the knowledge and experience that you have …    That you have and you have had.  He is obviously not bound by that, but what you have pointed out here is the factual basis for misgivings you had at the time?    And these misgivings led you to I presume ask questions in your own mind and of others.  With hindsight are you able to say what was happening here or even to give a view?  DCJ is not going to be bound by it, but I think he may want to know.    You mention power.  Let me explore your less generous version.  Power in relation to Intelligence Services.  Where does that lead or where can it lead?    In relation to how Intelligence Services are used and to what end.    And you have referred to the use of disinformation?    You say in paragraph 13 that you reported to Minister Cwele together with your two colleagues who were appointed at the same time?   How did you regard this duty to report to the Minister?     Thank you, and of course in relation to the separate functions of the Executive and the Minister and the operational functions of the Intelligence Services you later illustrate an example of a clash?     The relationship between yourself at least and Minister Cwele was strained, we know that.   What was the first indication of such strain.  Chair we are at paragraph 14.     You were going to tell the Chair of the first incident which the relationship between yourself and others and the Minister, paragraph 14.     Yes, if I may just say Chair there is a substantial amount of evidence to be given and this background is very important in order to evaluate that ...[intervenes]      I mean it is essential.     Mr Shaik in paragraph 15 you deal with certain changes made to the cabinet by former President Zuma around – in and around October 2010.     You refer in paragraph 15 of your statement Mr Shaik to a cabinet reshuffle in and around October 2010 at the hands ofthe former President Zuma.     There is one particular appointment there that is relevant to our evidence, what was that?     There was a press report to which you refer in paragraph 16 in relation to the appointment, what was that?     Was the decision in relation to the matters that ought to be investigated, I will ask you ...[indistinct –mic off]     Did you discuss the intended approach with anyone else, for example your Deputy Directors General?     There was a related issue pertaining to the investigation.    Perhaps Chair Mr Shaik was being polite in the way he expressed his views earlier on.  But I am sure you have disabused him of the need.   Mr Shaik there was another reason for the investigation which you relate in paragraphs 20 and 21. Please tell the Chair about that?    Or to tell you what did not happen.    What were the consequences for South Africa be if this scenario were correct?    Right.  You say in paragraph 21 that you did discuss this concern with the President at the time?    And you were given certain reassurances?    To the effect of…    Right so as I understand it.    The decision was made for more than one reason to conduct an investigation?    You say in paragraph 23 that shortly after thisdecision was made certain things happened.  What happened?    Yes.  Before you get to the contents of the meeting Mr Shaik there are two issues that perhaps you should inform the Chair of.  The first is how frequently would a Minister take steps to call to account operational executives in operational matters?  Was this a common occurrence?    And the second point is,     Mr Shaik would you comment then on the basis of your own knowledge and experience in relation to intelligence matters on the appropriateness or otherwise of a Minister becoming involved in operational matters.    Yes I am coming there now.    It is just a matter of general principle.    Mr Shaik what was the tone of the meeting?    How long did this meeting last?    Right.   Thank you Chair.  You will recall a few minutes ago Mr Shaik that you gave evidence in general terms about the principles which adhere to the relationship between a Minister on the one hand and the Operational Executives on the other.  At this meeting in Cape Town did the Minister say anything about his authority and whether investigations could or could not be conducted without his authority?    In a sense that the meeting in Cape Town resulted or did not result in any agreed way forward was this - was the issue between yourselves on the one hand and the Minister on the other resolved?    Right.  Have you any idea from that meeting or elsewhere where the Minister would have received information about the business interests of Director Njenje?    Have you any idea of what the Intelligence capabilities of the Gupta family were?    In relation to whether or not the Minister had the authority either to instruct or to stop an investigation and in relation to the issue as to whether Operational Executives were entitled to conduct an investigation without the authority of the Minister.  What was the position put by yourself and your two colleagues?    How did the meeting end?    No, no.  I am …    No.  Not entirely.    Just one more question.    In relation to whether the investigations shouldcontinue or should be stopped.  I think you have told the Chair that no agreement was reached …    In that regard.    What was the position of yourself and your two colleagues in that regard?    Yes.  I have - I - I just want to put …    The version of Ambassador Maqetuka …    Right.    As you have told the Chair there will be further inrelation to the evidence in relation to this meeting and I would just like to put to you the version of that meeting as testified Ambassador Maqetuka.    Yes and I will give - give you a copy of his statement.    Now.    In his statement.  Yes.  I apologise.   As to be testified perhaps.    I would like him to have the benefit of the …    Copy in case he wishes to comment.    I understand.  My authority does not always extend that far.    Accept in operational matters.    Yes.  I - I will take note of that.  Encourage from that Chair.    In regard to the meeting …    Would you just look at paragraphs 6 and seven.  That is all you need to look at.    For the moment at any rate.    Okay.  Paragraph 6 the following statement is    He - he says the meeting started in the early evening and went on till about midnight.  I do not think much turns on    An hour or two you said.       The statement continues in paragraph 6   That is correct you say.  Paragraph 7   “The Minister continued - the Minister …” Sorry.  My apologies.“This the Minister ignored and he continued with his line of addressing the issues on Njenje.”    “The meeting ended without resolving the matter.” So far …    It seems that you are in broad agreement …    At least.“Later we learnt from the media that the Minister had instructed us to stop the investigation.  I have to say that I do not recall him having given such an instruction.Let alone that a Minister for Intelligence would have no mandate to stop an investigation where the organisation had assessed the need to so investigate.” It seems that there is some difference between your recollection and the recollection of Ambassador Maqetuka.    Well he says he does not recall such an instruction being given …    To stop the investigation.    So your recollection is clear.    Yes.    By way of summary then we have a meeting that took place for up to two hours or more than two hours.  What was the essential point of difference between the three Executives and the Minister?   You have given evidence that the meeting was to say the least confrontation and adversarial?   Strong views were expressed?    Did you ever take a position which showed that you had been persuaded by the Minister’s views?    Did - did you agree at any stage with the Minister’s stance?    Did he at any stage agree with the stance that you had taken, that is the three of you?     So over the period of the meeting in quite confrontational circumstances  ...[intervenes]      ...and confrontationally expressed is it your evidence then that the Minister persisted in his view that the investigation should not take place and you persisted in your views that it should take place.     We still have to consult with Ambassador Maqetuka but ...[intervenes]      Chair can I suggest compromise, because there is a substantial amount of evidence still to come.     The statement is in parts quote terse and I wouldalso like to canvas with Mr Shaik certain issues arising out of the evidence of the former President, which might fall peculiarly within his knowledge, so that is in addition to the statement, so it is not just a matter of remaining parts of the statement, but there are issues on which I would ask leave to ask further questions.     And one set of questions that is not contained in the statement, so may I suggest five o’clock.     I hope that accords with the availability.     That is all subject to the absolute unreliability of counsel’s predictions in relation to time.     As you please.     Yes.     Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Shaik just one question on the meeting with the Minister to which you have testified.  The issue of Mr Njenje’s business interests was that the only reason given for a discontinuation or suggested discontinuation of the investigation?    Just as a matter of principle even if one of the three executives has a conflict of interest would that have affected the in principle decision to investigate where there was a need to investigate’    Did a meeting with the President follow?    How long after the meeting with the Minister?    Where did you meet with the President?    Who was present at the meeting?    And what happened at the meeting?  If you could just describe to the Chair principally the exchange between yourselves on the one hand and the President on the other?    Did the former President give any factual basis for rejecting what his security operatives have told him?    And your report was the product I take it of yourown investigations?      And analysis.    Did the matter then turn or did the discussion then turn to the issues of the Gupta investigation?    What transpired?    Did he say anything about foreign capital and the purchase of the Uranium Mine?    Did he specify how the Gupta family had helped him with his son Duduzane?    Assume for a moment that the narrative about the Gupta’s and their relationship with the President was being used aspart of a conspiracy to harm or dethrone President Zuma.  Would that have been any reason to stop the investigation?    And was this perhaps not in the exact terms youhave expressed now but were these sentiments conveyed to the former President?    You say in your statement in relation to what you recall and do not recall about a specific instruction from the President.  Well what do you say now about whether he instructed you or not expressly to stop the investigation?    Right.  So do I understand from that answer that there was no express instruction?    In as many words, stop the investigation.    You were left with a certain impression at the conclusion of the meeting which you have now expressed to the Chair.    Did you act on your conclusion?    On reflection how did you regard the attitude of the President in relation to security matters in general and this matter in particular?    How did you feel as a senior security official after the meeting had concluded?    And ultimately I understand you did accept that situation?    So to summarise at the point that you departed from the Minister - in the meeting with the Minister I understand your evidence and correct me if I am wrong to be that the three senior Executives were determined to continue with this investigation subject to a discussion with the President?    You went to a meeting with the President where to your knowledge he exercised his constitutional powers and influence?   The result of that intervention was that the investigation was terminated?    Chair it is past 5 o’ clock.  We have a way to go …    And …    There is much to be done before tomorrow.    Because we have to consult …    I would prefer if we started at the normal time …    And attempt to finish …    Tomorrow.    Chair one is reluctant, because - because much of this evidence forms the background to evidence that will come later.  One is reluctant to …    Divest oneself of the advantage of hearing …   Senior officials in the investigations, because the question of accountability, the question of controls, the question of financial accountability and supervision all are central to evidence that is to come.  In other words to answer the question did you pose.  How did it happen?    Section 90(1).    90(1).   It reads under the heading Acting President   “When the President is absent from the Republic or otherwise unable to fulfil the duties of President or during a vacancy in the Office of the President an Officer Bearer in the Order below acts as President.”  “B, a Minister designated by the President.  C, a Minister designated by the other Members of the Cabinet.  D, the Speaker until the National Assembly designates one of its othermembers.”    Section 96(2) …    And 96(1) also refer to the Code of Ethics to which you referred.    “Members of the Cabinet and Deputy Ministers must act in accordance with the Code ofEthics prescribed by National Legislation.  Members of the Cabinet and Deputy Ministers may not undertake any other paid work, act in a way that is inconsistent with their office or expose themselves to any situation involving the risk of a conflict between their official responsibilities and private interests or use their position or any information entrusted to them to enrich themselves or improperly benefit any other person.”

ADV LAMOLA:   Thank you very much Chairperson.   My name is Madimetja Lamola, I am here on a watch and brief on behalf of Dr Siyabonga Cwele.     Minister of Intelligence.    Thank you very much. 
MR RIEAZ SHAIK:   Rieaz Shaik.     I truly affirm. 
MR SHAIK:   No.     Thank you Sir.     That’s correct.     It is my signatory.     I am indeed.     Chair I – in paragraphs 1 to 9 I outline my history in respect to intelligence matters, which essentially started as a result of my detention, which led to a intelligence breakthrough for the ANC and in that capacity I received training in East Germany.  I then returned illegally into the country to set up an intelligence structure and I worked directly under the supervision and command of former President Jacob Zuma and as a result of the knowledge I accrued in the so-called underground days of intelligence I was included into the negotiation process, so I was a delegate to CODESA 1, CODESA 2, the multi-party talks I was nominated to serve on the Sub-Council of Intelligence, I was the Chair of the Amalgamation Committee that amalgamated the various statutory and non-statutory intelligence services in the 1991 to 1994 period.   I was very much part together with my colleagues in passing the three pieces of legislation that governs the Intelligence Services and I am proud to say that I was also contributor to the Chapter 11 onthe Constitution which is a remarkable first in the world where matters of intelligence were in the constitution of the country.Since then and I then left the Intelligence Services in 1997, I joined the Department of Foreign Affairs, it was then called Department of Foreign Affairs, I served as Consul General in Hamburg, I returned, I was then appointed by President Mandela as the Ambassador to Algeria.  I then returned, served as the Special Advisor to Minister Dlamini-Zuma.   Then I left government again and I returned to government in 2009 in my capacity as Director General of South African Secret Service.    Very much so.     That is correct Chair.   Some point in 2009 ...[intervenes]      At some point in 2009, I think it was in May 2009 if I may be mistaken, I received a phone call, there was a lot of speculation before that in the media that my colleagues and I may be returning tothe Intelligent Services and we then received a phone call from the Minister’s office, from Minister Cwele’s office to avail ourselves for a meeting.  When we arrived at this meeting ...[intervenes]      He was already the Minister of Intelligence, yes.     Correct, I would try assist the Chair in making thatunderstanding of the difference between Intelligence and State Security Agency.     Correct.     Correct.     Absolutely correct.     So it will be safe to say sir that at the beginning of the Fifth Administration in 2009 the appointment of Minister Cwele was appointed as the Minister of State Security, all other Ministers prior to 09 were Ministers of Intelligence, so in 2009 when the former President announced his cabinet he appointed Minister Cwele as the Minister of State Security.     So then at this meeting at Minister Cwele’s office the three of us Mr Njenje, Ambassador Maqetuka and myself met, we were in a holding room, and this is the first time we have spoken in a longtime and we were all okay why are we here, and very shortly then we were led into a press conference in which it was announced that Ambassador Maqetuka is the Director General of SSA, Mr Gibson would be the head of the domestic branch of the SSA and I was appointed as the head of the foreign branch of the SSA.       It was a very strange and odd situation for me myself this is the first time I was hearing that I would be now appointed as the Head of the Foreign Branch, but of course in the holding room we did discuss and I think the Minister did make a brief appearance to tell us that we are now assuming the responsibility of the management of theIntelligence Services, but that is the way I recall it.     A very brief thing, and then we were led to the press conference, yes.     Yes if I can just add a little clarification sir.     It is correct what you would have because the statement was given a year ago, and then in consultation with  the legal team it was agreed to turn it into an affidavit.     I must say in the affidavit that I had before me there are some changes, they are either I neatened it up in terms of instead of long history I kept it more precise.    And there were some typo’s that you will find and which may irritate you when you see it, has been changed.       That is correct.     Correct.     Correct.     Yes, yes I do.    That is correct.    These red blocks represent the different organisations that were created by the National Strategic Intelligence Act and they are theNational Intelligence Agency, the NIA which was responsible for domestic intelligence.    The Act that defined the – the mandate of the various intelligence component is the National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994.    That is correct.   The National Intelligence Agency responsible for the collection of domestic intelligence.    And also had the counter intelligence function.    The next one is the South African Secret Service and the South African Secret Service was responsible for the collection of intelligence outside the borders of South Africa.  Foreign intelligence so to speak.    The next is Crime Intelligence and that refers to the intelligence gathered by the police in respect of prosecuting domestic crime or international crime.   And Military Intelligence is intelligence required by the military for the deployment of troops and for their state of readiness.    That deals with the domestic intelligence.  So in other words intelligence inside of the country that where the bulk of the issues relates to domestic issues whether they are political unrest, whether it is the reasons why we have unrest in the country, the crime networks, the cartels etcetera.    So it is – and others could be on how government is perceived, how it is – the domestic component of intelligence is what we call the NIA’s function.    And included that they would have the function of counterintelligence.    So in other words any threat directed towards the state, organs of state, individuals of the state that would be the function of the NIA to be able to count – firstly identify the threat and then counter that threat and broadly we refer to that as counterintelligence.    Yes.    Yes.    And we would know it also as…    Correct.  They are the serious things and the less serious things.    Yes.  The – yes there is a measure of overlap.    To the extent that the criminal network becomes sophisticated and a good example will be the drug cartels.    The movement of drugs and a very good example is and I hope I get it right.   The drug Nyaope.    Which is decimating our townships.    And our cities.    Etcetera.    And Nyaope is a heroine based drug.   And heroine is a product of a plant grown in Afghanistan, Pakistan etcetera.    And that is that part of the world.    We are here in – in Africa.    The – that drug has to come from Afghanistan, Pakistan.    Through here and most times it enters the East Coast.    Of the Indian Ocean.    And then through various countries smuggled in – intoSouth Africa.    So you can see just in that example.    How foreign intelligence would be used to monitor the flow of these drugs.    And when it enters the country here it enters a distribution network.    So you can see now how the – the domestic intelligence will get involved in the distribution network.    To understand the distribution network.    And then eventually when the drugs are sold and the monies flow.    Because monies will also flow in the reverse process.    You will get the Financial Intelligence Centre getting involved.  You will get the NIA getting involved in respect of that.    And when it is now prosecuted as a crime.    That is when Crime Intelligence gets involved.    Yes.    Absolutely correct.    Yes.  That is correct Sir.    That was the – the way it was designed.    And then if you look at the red line and maybe I am just getting ahead of the evidence leader.    But if you look at the …    The red structures and above that is the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee.   And that is a – the committee that was designed to share this kind of intelligence.    Both tactical intelligence.    And at a strategic level.    Yes.    Absolutely correct.    And let us just take another example in the case of ATM.    ATM bombs.    Ja.    There the Crime Intelligence.   Would deploy its resources.    To get to know who are behind that etcetera.    And they would then request.    To the – the – the Civilian Intelligence Community.    Technological Support.   Which is then given to – to Crime Intelligence when they are leading the investigation.    Yes.  So you will recall that in our awful history of apartheid.    We had structures created under Military Intelligence.    And a good example would be the CCB.    Which engaged in extra judicial killings in the country.    So one of the …   That is the civil cooperation bureau.      So one of the key principles that emerged during the negotiations was that the military will not be able to conduct intelligence inside of the country.    And this was a – a – and it still remains a fascinating discussion.    Because any institution that when it deploys has to rely on its own intelligence.    It does not invariably rely on other people’s intelligence when it is deploying.    So it is easy in the case of the military when they are involved in operations outside of the country.  Military Intelligence will inform the terrain, the gathering, the persons that informs the deployment of the military outside the country.  Of course the difficulty will arise and – and we would have such a situation in the call to deploy the military inside the country.  Then the question will remain, what intelligence will the military rely on when it deploys inside the country?  But at the time we did not envisage that contradiction and we believed that through the mechanism of NICOC the coordinatingmechanism that we would be able to best resolve that issue if and when it arose.    Yes that is it.    Shoke.    No.  The – in the main Sir that will be the function perhaps of the counterintelligence of the NIA and to some extent Crime Intelligence.  But let me just assure you firstly that I do not think there is anyone willing to attack South Africa.  And secondly those who want to take over the headquarters must first know where the headquarters is.    And we get that wrong sometimes.    Correct.    Correct.    And it may have a combination inward and outward.    ja.    Yes.    In the – in the case of Crime Intelligence and Military Intelligence there is a capacity by the Civilian Intelligence that has intercept capacities and a structure was created for request from the Military Intelligence and Crime Intelligence to this structure to intercept on behalf of Crime Intelligence and Military Intelligence.    The joint services pertained to the National Intelligence Agency and the South African Secret Service.  The – the Crime Intelligence was a division of the South African Police Service and they have their own organisational culture, training etcetera.  To the extent that sometimes there is cooperation yes but these joint services in this diagram represents the – the joint services that were prevalent in 1994 between the NIA and the South African Secret Service.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes. I must – I must point out Sir that this was all applicable in the 1994/1997 period.      Things have changed since then.   Yes.    Correct.    That is correct.    No it is correct.    No you are not.    Chair, the - the issue arose during the negotiation process how best should the Intelligence Services be managed a controlled and during the negotiation process that led to the sub council of Intelligence.  A set of principles were agreed upon and these principles then were reflected in the Constitution and in the Legislation. It was never envisaged that we would have a fully-fledgedMinister and if I draw your attention to the various sections in the Constitution.  In - in respect of defence … (intervenes).    Oh.  We will get there.  Okay.    So there was never envisaged that there would be a dedicated Minister of Intelligence and in 1994 under the then President Mandela the Minister of Justice assumed the administrative responsibility for the Intelligence Services not the direction and thecontrol in terms of the substance of their work, but in respect of the administrative matters. The budget matters.  The appointment matters.  The regulation matters, but not the control of the Intelligence process itself.    “The following principles govern National    Or a particular Government.    Exactly.  Exactly and whereas here is a fundamental constitutional shift where the Constitution puts an obligation to pursue National Security through human security of South African citizens.    Yes.    Yes.  That is a very interesting distinction, sir.   The - the understanding of human security is that we would address the concerns and the fears and the wants of - of your citizens.  Let - let me give you an example.  We have incredible public service delivery protests and public service delivery protest is a direct result of the lack of poor services. The solution to that is not to look at those who are agitating for the protest.  The solution to that is to address the issues of the poor public service delivery and that is a classic distinction between human security and what we will call State Security where you areprotecting.  Of course the police would have to protect the institutions. For example when our trains get burnt.  There is a fair amount intelligence that is required to prevent that, but ultimately the - the solution to that problem rests in insuring that there is efficient trained services and efficient and able and capable and affordable trained services. So if you put too much emphasis on the protection of the State’s assets or the Government’s assets you are forgetting the most fundamental thing.  What is the reason why this is happening?    Correct.    Yes.    Absolutely correct.    Absolutely correct.    It goes to how you understand …   The function of security ….    And hear what - what the founders of the Constitution felt that it was important to put the correct perspective.    On how National …    Security should be viewed.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    The - and again this is influenced by historical context.  Much of the - the paradigm to keep apartheid alive meant destabilising countries outside of South Africa where it was envisaged that liberation forces had military basis and a classical example you will know that in Mozambique you had tremendous amount of funding going from the then South African Defence Force to forces and I just do not want to name them. Perhaps I could.  Say went to Renamo which was a counter insurgency outfit in Mozambique that was engaging in the destabilisation of the national party.  The Frelimo Party that took party in 1997 in Mozambique or 1994 - 1974.    1974.  Yes.    So we then had a situation where South Africans wereengaged in armed conflict outside of South Africa and they were considered to be mercenaries and what we wanted in our Constitution is to avoid South Africans getting involved in international conflict where they are selling their services as mercenaries. So as a result of that a - a law was passed that prohibited that in the main and there were certain conditions that had - you had to apply before you engage in that kind of activity.    Armed conflict in South Africa?    The …    It is absolutely forbidden and illegal …    And should be prosecuted.    Again - again sir that the Intelligence and security in - in the apartheid era had certain features which was unacceptable for us as we entered the - as we wanted to construct a new paradigm.  Forexample Intelligence or security could not be a law onto itself and the Nuremburg doctrine of I just followed an order or I just followed a command. We wanted to make sure that that none of that applies in our democracy.  So we then said that National Security must be subject to the authority of Parliament.  So Parliament should be fully involved in the affairs of Intelligence.  In the affairs of security.  So that Parliament is kept abreast of what is happening including the budget. Including money allocations.  Including operations and we came up with a particular formula in which for that to happen and youwill notice that we - we created under the National Strategic - the Intelligence Oversight Act.  We created for the first time in South Africa two important institutions. The first is the institution of a Joint Standing Committee of Intelligence which was then called the JC - JSCI.  It is a multiparty committee that has full access to all that Intelligence does and has full access to the records of the Intelligence Community, the budget etcetera and so through a Joint Standing Committee and Parliamentary Intelligence and we found creative mechanisms to get around some of the - the obligations of democracy and balancing transparency and accountability. I think those members are vetted - in Parliament are vetted.  They go through a process.  They go through an induction on how to deal with the secret information.  So that is the - the first.  The second mechanism was the appointment of the Inspector-General ofIntelligence. Now we saw the Inspector-General of Intelligence as a kind of Intelligence Ombud that - where the public - where the public who feels aggrieved by any misconduct of the intelligence service would have an office or an instrument to be able to raise matters and we so felt that the founders of the Constitution felt it such an important institution that it put an obligation that it was put in the Constitution    Yes.    So under the - the establishment we defined under Section    Okay.    Yes.  It is …    It is in accordance with the discussions …    And it was envisaged that - that Intelligence will be aNational capability.  So there was going to be no - no province is going to establish an own Intelligence Service and therefore it was insisted that only by the Constitution and of course this is a clever way to write it, because if you look at the - the President’s power. Only the President can establish an Intelligence Service and only in keeping with National Legislation, but we will get - get to that later.  Ja.    So 1-9-9-(2) onwards.  Again it establishes   Yes.  Informed by our history and we wanted - we wanted to remove completely the ignorance of the law.  So no Intelligence Service Member must be able to say I did not know the law and therefore the obligation was placed on the Intelligence or the Security Services which the Intelligence Services are part of. To teach and train its members not only on the Constitution, but also in terms of International Law and other - other law.  So it was a requirement to ensure that our new Intelligence Services or the new Security Services were going to act in - in the spirit of the Constitution and to uphold the Constitution in its entirety.   Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Correct.    Correct.    And - and you are absolutely right, sir and that is why it is in both cases where it is not manifestly illegal.  Then our teachings of our members of the law should equip them to make the right decision …    And where it is manifestly illegal they have a constitutional obligation not to obey that.  So we felt very strongly about it.    So you are absolutely correct.    It is indeed and I …    It reads   Yes.    Correct.    That is correct sir.     That is correct sir.     No.     Then use the NIA example.     Clearly wrong.     Indeed it is.     And let me just touch on a very important point in respect of that sir.  The – different people perceive intelligence remarkably different.  Some people see intelligence as you know the dark arts, you are there to keep them in power by predicting the future etcetera andthat is a really antiquated concept of intelligence and those who believe in that concept of intelligence invariably get things awfully wrong but that is a subject matter for another time.     Thank you I will sir thank you.    The – do I need to read it into …[intervenes].     So 1998,“To give effect to the principles of transparency andaccountability multi-party parliamentary committees musthave oversight of all security services in a mannerdetermined by National legislation of the rules and orders ofparliament”.     It’s not optional you are absolutely correct sir it is not an option it’s a must and again the reason being that we wanted, in our young democracy at the time for all parties to have a level of comfort that the workings of the Intelligence Services or the Security Services are in keeping with the values enshrined in the constitution and that we are consistent with the code of conduct expected of the Security Services given the history of our past.  So there was no attempt to hide the Security Services away from parliament in fact, a lot went into the thinking by ensuring that parliament plays a proper role of oversight over the Security Services and that was the thinking.    Oversight over expenditure as well, correct.  So to the best of my understanding, in the case of the Police, the Military and the Intelligence Services these oversight committees do exist and these oversight committees have access to the budgets and are required to make an input prior to budget allocations.     Yes, if we look at section 2011 under the title Political Responsibility a member of Cabinet must be responsible for defence that is 201 and I’ll quickly read out 2061 again under police under the section Political Responsibility, 2016 says,“A member of the Cabinet must be responsible for policingand must determine National Policing Policy after consultingthe provincial governments and take into account the Policingneeds and priorities of the provinces as determined by theprovincial Executives”,So in both the case of the defence and the police the constitution stipulates that there must a member of Cabinet responsible for that.    Yes.     It’s a fascinating interpretation I must say but let me giveyou the interpretation I understood at the time or the reasoning not the interpretation the reasoning.  We wanted to avoid a situation where the President assumes the responsibility as Minister of Police or the President assumes responsibility as a Minister of Defence as is in the case of certain countries where the President is also the Minister of Defence.  In the South African situation and especially through the negotiations we specifically wanted to avoid the Presidential assumption of the Military and Police power and therefore wrote it in this way, that a member of Cabinet must be responsible for Defence understanding that it is a member other than the President.    Correct.     That’s correct.     That is correct.     Yes.    So under Section 209 (1),“Any Intelligence Service other than any Intelligence Divisionof the Defence Force or Police Service may be establishedonly by the President as the head of the National Executiveand only in terms of National Legislation.  (2) The Presidentas the head of the National Executive must appoint a womanor a man as the head of each Intelligence Service establishedin terms of sub-section (1) and must either assume politicalresponsibility for the control and the direction of any of thoseservices or designate a member of the Cabinet to assumethat responsibility”,So the first part is that the President – only the President can establish an Intelligence Service and only in terms of National legislation.  National legislation should come first be debated by Parliament and then the President can establish it in terms of that National legislation.  So there’s a link, so the President’s power toestablish Intelligence Services is limited in my opinion.  Second, the President unlike the constitutional provisioning that says in the case of the Defence they must be a member of Cabinet in the case of Police they must be a member of Cabinet and the Intelligence, it places the obligation on the President to assume the responsibility of the Intelligence Services or designate a member of the Cabinet to assume that function.  Now…[intervenes].     Yes the President…[intervenes].     Absolutely correct and there’s a slight preference and the slight preference is, he’s got to assume the responsibility right, so the default is that he assumes it or he can designate it to a member of the Cabinet. Now I’m not going to seek an interpretation of the word of theCabinet but my understanding is that it is a member of the Cabinet already.     Yes.     That’s correct sir.     And perhaps then we will then come back to the diagram to see why there was a Minister of Justice.     Okay so under the powers and functions and monitoring,“Section 210 National legislation must regulate the objects,powers and the functions of the Intelligence Servicesincluding any Intelligence division of the Defence Force orthe Police Service and must provide for a) the coordination ofall Intelligence Services and b) civilian monitoring of theactivities of those services by an inspector appointed by thePresident as the head of the National Executive and provideby resolution adopted by the National Assembly with thesupporting vote of at least two thirds of it’s members”.     And approved ja correct.     Absolutely.    That is correct.        No.     To the best of my recollection the interim constitution did not express a view either which way on Intelligence matters I think it governed a whole range of other issues but nothing turns on that simply because President Mandela, in appointing his Cabinet in 1994appointed the Minister of Justice to be the person responsible for dealing with administrative matters of things.  So he was the Minister of Justice and remember – and that was 1994.  The final constitution again to the best of my memory was adopted in 1996.  So in 1996 the final constitution made provisions for how this matter should be dealt with but that came after but in 1994 President Mandela did appoint the Minister of Justice the then – the late Minister Dullah Omar as the Minister of Intelligence and a Deputy Minister of Intelligence.  So he appointed a Deputy Minister but I’m sure the evidence leader is going to lead us to that matter of the coordinate of Intelligence.    Yes.    So in 1994 once the – the various pieces of legislation was passed the President appointed a coordinate of intelligence and that coordinate of the intelligence was at the time sitting member of Parliament Joe Nhlanhla and – so he was appointed as the coordinator of intelligence and he was also assumed the function of the Deputy Minister of Intelligence.  And Coordinate Nhlanhla reported directly to the President as envisaged by the Legislation and coordinated the work of the Intelligence Services which is the section that we have been through in the block.   So he had direct access.  He was not a memberof the cabinet but the cabinet consisted of a Cabinet Security Committee in which President Mandela chaired.  No which Deputy President De Klerk chaired and President Mandela was in attendance together with Deputy President Mbeki.  And it was a function of Joe Nhlanhla and his team to make presentations to the cabinet on matters of intelligence and have direct access to the President in respect of other matters of intelligence.  That is the first lot.    The oversight is again because we were in that incredibly honeymoon period all the different parties worked together and the –the Intelligence Joint Standing Committee and Intelligence Oversight was formed.  It was a multi-party body.  They were resourced to have their own offices.  Protection was put in for them to have safe document keeping etcetera.  But that was a multi-party committee and it functioned very well over the Intelligence Services and then the process began for the appointment of the Inspector General and if my memory serves me well I think the first Inspector General was Doctor Randera.  He was appointed as the Inspector General.    Randera, Fazel Randera.    If my memory serves me well.    Yes Advocate Skweyiya.   I think was the first.    Right Advocate Skweyiya was the first and then Doctor Randera.  The office of the Inspector General had considerable power so to speak, the power of subpoena, the power of getting whatever document from the Intelligence Services and the Intelligence Services at that time was imbued with the spirit of democratic accountability.  So there was a much more forthcoming engagement with the office of the Inspector General then I would say it is now but that will be mycomment.    So – so you will recall that I said that the – a sitting member of Parliament late Joe Mhlanhla was appointed as the coordinator.  This gave incredible anxiety to the then democratic party who then also in the spirit of reconciliation and cooperative governance raised the issue with President Mandela’s office that you could not have a sitting member of Parliament being considered as the coordinator of Intelligence which was envisaged to be a – a non-political party position in keeping with the – the sections that we read earlier.    Yes.  And in addition Parliament had an oversight function. Right.  So he had – so there was this conflict that was there.  It was then decided that the law be amended.  So the law was amended having just passed it in 1994 it was then amended and what then emerged was the – the diagram that you see before you here.  With the powers of the coordinator in the main were then housed under the Ministers of Intelligence Services and a Minister of Intelligence Services was established.  The National Intelligence Committee became now under the supervision of the Minister.  And this is the beginning of the Ministry of Intelligence and the development of a Minister of Intelligence as opposed to the reporting lines directly to thePresident.    The oversight functions of Parliament remained except if my – again my memory serve me correct that the Minister or the – the Inspector General’s office became dependent on – or reported directly now to the Minister and increasingly became dependent on the Minister Budget wise, staffing wise etcetera.  So that was the other significant change.    Remained the same.    That is the Parliamentary.    Yes.   It is a committee of Parliament Chair.    That is correct.    It was not a …    Bureaucratic.   Correct.    That is correct.  You would…    Yes.    That is correct.  So what happened was the process establish the National Intelligence Agency as a standalone organisation.  The Secret Services as a standalone organisation and then certain functions that were previously in the NIA were not created as standalone entities.  And those entities are indeed the National Academy of Training.  So it was called – A Training Academy that trained both members of the – the National Intelligence Agency and members of the South African Secret Service and offered training to other departments if so requested.  The National Communications Centre is the – is the centre that has the technological capacity to engage in technological intelligence interception and that is called the NCC.  The electronic communication of CONCEC was a – an entity created to deal with internal communications of government so thatgovernment could communicate to each other in a more secure – secure way than it currently or it was doing at the time.  And lastly the office of the Interception Centre was a – again a authority created whereby the Police and the Military and the Civilian Intelligence could address its request for particular interception.  And again it had to follow a particular protocol.  The office of the interception would have to get judicial approval for this.  The judge will stipulate the period for how long and under what conditions etcetera and it was the office, the IOC obligation to ensure that the regulations or the stipulations were indeed adhered to.   Yes.  So under the – the Intelligence Organogram entitled 10 to 2019 there was now a – a reversal so to speak.  Right and the reversal was the proclamation created a new entity called the SSA the South African – the     I cannot even get the name.  State Security Agency and the NIA was converted into the domestic branch of the SSA and the South African Secret Service was converted into the foreign branch of the SSA.  And all of this was done by proclamation.   And all of this would have been under the auspices of the Director General.  I was made or Mr Gibson Nganga was made the Head of the domestic branch.  I was made the head of the foreign branch and because it was an interim period we assumed our functions as Director Generals of those previous services.  And it was considered this is be an interim period as the new paradigm was evolving.  I say that it was made by proclamation and it did create some anxiety for us and in particular for me because I was not too sure whether a proclamation is in keeping with the words that the President for anyintelligence service other than the intelligence division of the Defence or Police Service may be established only by the President.  Yes the President did establish by proclamation as the Head of the National Executive.  Yes he did so in his capacity as Head of the National Executive and only in terms of National Legislation.  I was not – I was not of the view that proclamation represents National Legislation.      It is Section 209[1].    Exactly.    Ja and that precisely was our concern.    And I must say it is a concern of Ambassador Maqetuka.    Concern of Director General Gibson and myself.    Because we had the experience and the knowledge of theway – what was intended?    By the Constitution.  What was intended in the Legislation and when we saw it in proclamation we were a little confused on is this usurping the – the authority of Parliament because if you remember earlier on we – it says that National Security must be subject to the authority of the executive and Parliament.    And this was a structure of a National Security being born.    Through proclamation where Parliament has – had not yet the benefit.    Of debating the proclamation.    Or the National Legislation.    That is correct.    And the intent was very clear.    That is correct.    Yes.      Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    That is correct.  If I may just add one more point that – that in the manner in which all this has been arrived at the principle and which I am very passionate about – the principle of coordination in my view has been undermined.  So now we have gone back to asituation where each intelligence agency – I mean each intelligence services whether it is the security, the Civilian Intelligence Service or the Police or the Military because they have been – there have been bad coverage about all of them you can see that you are starting to see the breakdown of the coordination which is what the Constitution intended.  So in a period of – from the time these changes were made you effectively have no coordination.    Correct.    Ja.    Correct in the absence of coordination you would have frolics of your own.  You would have in the intelligence world everyone recruiting the same source and in my opinion has given rise to the entrenchment of a phenomenon not unique to South Africa.  The phenomenon of disinformation, information pedlars and bogus informants which is a phenomenon that features regularly in South Africa’s lexicon and language.    Later on.  Yes.   Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.  These were the - the structures before the change.  They were the structures that resulted first on the founding Legislation in 1994 and the Amended Legislation in 1997 and they are the NationalIntelligence Agency, the South African Secret Service, the South African National Academy of Intelligence.    The training.  The National Communication Centre which is the infrastructure for the interceptions.  The Office of the Interception Centres which is the facilitating office of the Regulatory Office and the Electronic Communications System.  Otherwise known as COMSEC.  As the Communication System to be put in place between an amongst Government departments.    That is - that is correct.     That is correct.    Yes indeed.  The - the white paper that informed the laws that were passed in 1994 had a very rational basis to why we wanted to have the dispensation that we negotiated for about four years and one of the central principles was to ensure that we do not have excessive concentration of power in one organisation which is what in fact occurred under the previous dispensation - the apartheid dispensation.  Where you had for example the National Intelligence Service thathoused both the domestic operation and its foreign operation.  So one of the principles of the new dispensation was to separate these powers and … (intervenes).    Separate and coordinate.    So that is why coordination became a - a principle and the separation of powers became a principle.    Yes.  So that was the - the rationale that informed the democratic dispensation of Intelligence and it would appear to me that by the proclamation we were now going back to a pre-democratic era where we were consolidating everything into one organisation again.  With the unintended or intended consequence of excessive power inone organisation.    I was not party to those discussions.  They happened prior to our coming …    And subsequent when we tried to have those discussions that was not forthcoming either. That is correct.Under the leadership of the Director-General Ambassador Maqetuka.    That is correct.    Well my - my first doubt with - was that it was not - the President could establish an Intelligence Service, but had to do so in keeping with National Legislation.  It seemed to me that we were establishing an Intelligence Service by proclamation rather with in keeping with National Legislation.So Parliament was as we mentioned before did not have the benefit of discussing that National Legislation.  So that is the first objection I had.  The second was in the name and I know nothing much turns on the name, but State Security Agency seemed to me at least from a semantic point of view having moved away from human security which was the principle outlined in the - the Constitution, but and this is why when choosing the names originally in 1994 there was no reference to State Security in 1994. It was the National Intelligence Agency and the South African Secret Service and it was avoiding in the sense the use for the words“State Security”.    Thank you, sir.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    That is - that is correct, sir.   The - and remember that the State Security Agency was under the leadership of the Director-General Ambassador Maqetuka and I know that he is to give evidence and under his leadership we have tried on numerous occasions …    To get an understanding of the rationale.    So that we could believe …   In …    What it is that we were …    Were having to do …    And you were right …    In the sense that yes all three of us had the knowledge of the negotiation process, the passage through the 1994 Parliament.  So there was in a sense a disquiet amongst us about knowing the rationale for why we had separated things and not knowing the rationale now for why we are amalgamating things all together, but then we - we never survived that long to get to that point.   Set top.    Ja.    Hm.    Sure.    Sir, I - I think it speaks to the very concept of coherence in - in Government and - and perhaps that we have not all fully understood the importance of coherence and continuity and etceteraand I have discovered this problem throughout the continent and elsewhere.    Where this constant changing and the bureaucratic dysfunctionality it produces.    Hm.    Correct.   In - in my …    In - in my generous interpretation of the hindsight.  I would say that there was a lack of experience in understanding thecomplexities of Intelligence and why we designed what was designed at the time and with the dropping of my sugar levels I will say that it could be in my view a very narcissistic approach of the consolidation of power, because power is an attractive thing, but without assuming the obligations that come with the consolidation of that power. So it could be either of the two and in particular I would say that in - in the conduct of very senior officials and I must - and I must say that if you take Ambassador Maqetuka as a much senior person than I am and so is Mr Njenje who have perhaps a longer history in the Intelligence Services. We were not accorded the kind of respect that should normally accrue to persons with that experience and to allow that experience to shape the policies that was unfolding and that was rather unfortunate and it led to a situation which just became untenable.  So in my view it was a combination of inexperience in the Intelligenceaffairs and driven by a narcissistic consolidation of power.    Hm.   Well …    Sure.  The - it - it will go to a definition of intelligence.  That I would say that I accept and is generally accepted.  Intelligence is a profession of actionable wisdom.  Where wisdom is derived from the transformation of data to information.  Information into knowledge.  Knowledge into insight. Insight into wisdom which is designed either to predict eventsor influence events and in both cases either in the prediction or influencing of events intelligence represents an enormous amount of power under that concept.  A - a knowing what is to happen and knowing things that are unfolding allows one to be able to - to inference the - the direction of what is unfolding. Let me give you a very simple example.  So if I know that you are going to be appointed the next Minister of - of Finance.  Sitting here and I know this appointment will take place in a few days’ time.  I would also assess how the market will interpret your appointment and I will be able to make a prediction.A hedging of - of the currency against your appointment.  I could hedge the currency so that when that appointment does happen I would be able to get a windfall on it and of course I am assuming that you are a man and you are indeed a man of great respect in - in international communities. Therefore I would be able to hedge the - the currency.  So you could see how knowing events beforehand is - is such a - an important thing and that power.    Indeed.  That is the dark … (intervenes).   Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    I for - I for one - this felt somewhat uncomfortable for me and I know this is a very career limiting thin, but reaching the age that I have I could say it.  That I never truly believed in the - the role of a Minister in Intelligence.  I always felt it to be an oddity and I can explain why I believe it is an oddity and I do not believe that the Constitution - the Constitution preferred that this be a Presidential responsibility rather than a Ministerial responsibility. However having now to report to a Minister in my own mind I knew it will - it will provide the basis of conflict.  Does a Minister direct Intelligence Operations?  My understanding is the Minister should not direct Intelligence Operations and a range of these issues made me feel uncomfortable about having to report to a Minister and thepreference is that it - you would go the President and it is - it is an expression or let me just say a derivative of maturity. That if everyone understands that there are matters in which a - a Head of the Intelligence Service or in this case the Head of the - the State Security Agency should have unfettered access to the President to go and discuss with the President matters of National importance. An example of which could be if there was Intelligence picked up about the very Minister of Intelligence.  What would the Director-General do?  Will the Director-General take that Intelligence to thesubject of the Intelligence or should the - the Director-General be able to take this matter directly to the President and then the Minister should have the majority or the comfort to accept that in the event that such matters are taken directly to the President without his or her knowledge. That that is an acceptable practice of Intelligence.  Whereas if you only had one single route through a Minister you have a - you would be presented at some point in time with some difficulties.  Secondly, and this is again my issues and I know my colleagues may share it to various degrees. When you appoint a Minister of Intelligence in a Cabinet you are in effectively making him first amongst peers or her first among peers, because that Minister by the very portfolio that he or she occupies will come to know information about other Ministers for which he or she would have information about and it just seems that it - it is -it is an unpreferred situation and it should go directly to the President, but like I am saying the Constitution make provision for the delegation. The law makes - established a Minister.  I just felt it was - and this is a globally contested debated issue.  I always favoured the notion that the Intelligence should report directly to the President and not via a Minister and if you do have a Minister stipulate quite clearly what the Minister is entitled to do not entitled to do. What should the Director-General do and what the Director-General should not do.  So that there is no conflict in - in situations when it does arise.   Sure.    Sure.    Correct.    Yes.    I am - I am saying it is peculiar to Intelligence and there are various reasons for that.  In some countries the infiltration of some countries by your Intelligence Services is an event that could lead to those people coming under serious harm.  In the event that they are detected etcetera.So one has to apply incredible caution and the Director General and the law stipulates that the Director General is obliged to keep methods, sources, intelligence in such a way as to protect his or her members and the law makes no distinction from who it must be protected from but in my view it includes protecting it from the Minister, so that the Minister should not know that so and so may possibly beworking for the service or this is how the service is going to do certain things in order to protect the Minister, but also to protect the people involved in such operations, and because of the particular nature of intelligence due consideration must be given to what information is shared outside of the service and to who, and this is why the relationship of trust between the Head of the Service and the President is sacrosanct in Intelligence and the moment you feel that the Head of the Service feels that he lost, or she has lost the trust of the President the decent thing to do is to tender our resignation and to leave because outside of that trust no relationship in intelligence can work.    Correct.     Correct.     And that is the way it should be, and that is why you have got to see the three pieces of legislation together.  The Director General is responsible for the operation of the Intelligence Services, you have an Inspector General in cases of abuses, you have theParliamentary oversight committee in the cases to oversee budget etcetera, so a very elaborate system of checks and balances were put into place to ensure that there is no abuse, but it was premised on the understanding that the Intelligence Services and in particular the Director General will be professional, will conduct themselves – we have stipulated all of that in the Constitution that it will do things by the law etcetera, and it required for this entire architecture to work together and I must say for the first three or four years in my view and then I left it was working together and there was much maturation taking place.    The 1994 ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes in this particular case I – it is my evidence that the Minister attempted to direct an operation, which I found to be unlawful and we will come to that and I would give you examples and you can look again at various examples, but let me just give you one, and it is really unfortunate that the example I was going to use that has been raised by the previous, by the former President Zuma.   Former President Zuma made reference to spies in his evidence before the Commission.   Now spies is the work of the Intelligence Service.   You can imagine a situation where a Director General who is in charge of the Intelligence Service and Counter Intelligence and is now instructed by a Minister to please provide him or her the name of spies in the country and this is now given to a Minister.  That Minister because of changes in politics leaves a – the government service, does that Minister forget about who the spies were or not, or do they retain it in their head and what risk does that presentto those spies in the country.So that is one example where it is very dangerous for a Minister to demand operational knowledge about matters, but the President, when a President is no longer the President there are certain protocols that go into effect to still keep that President as if he were in a previous, as if he still was a President.   This is why the Presidential protocols are so intense, so ex President Mbeki, ex President Motlanthe, all still have to a certain degree protection and the use of State in order to keep them, and one of the reasons is, is that they would have in their capacity as Presidents come across verysensitive information of the State.  A Minister is not accorded that protection, a Minister is not accorded that protocol and God forbid I am not suggesting that ex Ministers of Intelligence are given this kind of protocol, I am just saying don’t appoint them in the first place Chair.     Correct, you could.     In principal you could yes.     That is correct, and that is why I would argue sir that it isa member of cabinet, not a member to cabinet.     If you get that subtle distinction.     In paragraph 14 ...[intervenes]      Chair you would recall that in 2009 the – during 2009 there was the Minister Cwele’s wife was subject to a drug trafficking offence and this matter related to the kind of protection or the kind of services that the SSA and particularly the domestic branch of the SSA was giving to Ms Cwele.  We discussed this matter and in particular it was a level of discomfort for Director Njenje and he raised this matter with the DG Maqetuka and myself and we had a forum of meetings where we all three would decide on a particular way and a dissentionwould mean we keep debating until we have consensus.We discussed this matter, we debated it through all ends and concluded that we, the SSA, again under the leadership of Ambassador Maqetuka will inform the Minister that we will no longer be providing these protection services to Ms Cwele, the Minister’s wife.   Of course this did create ...[intervenes]      I am also mindful sir of not giving the evidence of mycolleagues, who are here.     Okay.     No we are not far off, my understanding is that the domestic branch of the State Security Agency provided a kind of logistical support in terms of transporting Ms Cwele from the home tothe court, from the court back home, and all of these things incur expense and that expense has to accrue to a particular operation and Director Njenje had to sign off on it.   I think it is his uncomfortableness about continually signing off these matters made him to initiate the discussion amongst the three of us with all three of us agreeing to – that this service should be terminated.Of course the second and related issue is that we were management, the senior management of Intelligence Service providing services to a person who was convicted for drug trafficking offences and this is not ...[intervenes]     This is – no during the trial.     During the trial.     And with the presumption of innocence it was creating a sense of awkwardness to us in the sense of our own morality so to speak, so this discussion had to happen with the Minister and Director General Maqetuka led that discussion, supported by Director Njenje.     That is correct.     That conversation, I do not have that direct information.     I am sure that it is coming via Maqetuka and Gibson.     That is correct.     That was the – I mean I was saddened by the replacement by Minister Siphiwe Nyanda by Mr Padayachie but that just saddened me but the one that concerned me is the replace of Fikile or the appointment of Minister Fikile Mbalula.     So some time in 2011 was a press report that dealt with an NEC meeting of the ANC in which it was alleged in that report that Minister Mbalula raised his appointment or been informed about his appointments by the Guptas being called and informed about that appointment, and we had again under the leadership of AmbassadorMaqetuka we established what we call the Monday morning forum with the three of us under his leadership, Maqetuka, Gibson and I would meet every Monday morning to discuss things that occurred in the weekend or in the past week and it was a brainstorming session between the three of us, and the midday we would invite our deputies for lunch and others and have a kind of management meeting that will end sometime often late into the night, and this is the way we operated.So on this particular, this was a Sunday, on the Monday we met and we discussed this report and we were taken aback by the issues that were in that report.    So as you will recall sir that what was alleged in that report that there was an NEC meeting, and in this meeting Minister Mbalula raised the point that his appointment, he was notified of his appointment by one of the Gupta brothers but generally for the purpose of this discussion the Gupta Brothers.  Our concern was (a) this is either a breach of national security occurring in the office of the President, so there was a leak from the Office of the President, two, this is possible because the Guptas overheard this discussion while the President was in consultation with someone and they obtained this information and were now peddling this information for whatever benefit they wanted, or thirdly that they in fact actually suggested this appointment which makes this even more serious because then as foreign nationals they are suggesting whoshould be in the National Cabinet of another country.All three of these matters fall in the realm of National Security by my understanding.   A leak upon the President’s Office, information peddling if they have overheard this information and three if they suggested the name and this is a matter of counter-intelligence where a foreign national is influencing the appointment of cabinet ministers of another government, all three issues needed to be investigated.     Yes, so following the – following our morning meeting wehad lunch with our Deputy Director Generals and others and we informed them of our decision that an investigation into the Gupta’s should now occur based on the rationale that we have given, and I must say that an Intelligence investigation is an Intelligence investigation.  It will involved technological intelligence, it will involve surveillance, it will penetration, it will involve having a full understanding of the whole picture to answer those three questions primarily because it pertains to national security and a breach at the highest level of the government.     Yes.     It is very serious sir, if – and let me tell you of the three scenarios the overhearing the discussion is the least of the dangerousones, right, because if they have overheard it and if we have investigated and were allowed to investigate this we would have been able to make certain recommendations as Intelligence normally do, we will make recommendations in terms of how to avoid this situation in future, so that didn’t happen, but the second option, the option that if the appointment occurred at the suggestion of the Gupta’s and that is a significantly serious matter because it meant that there’s real possibility that a foreign government was making appointments.     Yes.     Correct, that’s absolutely correct and in fact it does occur in our media where editors or journalists would make certain suggestions that in order to fix this and this department up appoint so and so to that department, and that is considered democratic lobbying, which is not necessarily a counter intelligence matter, but it is doneopenly, it is done transparently and it is done –also it may even happen behind closed doors, that too is not a problem.The problem here in my opinion was the fact that the people who were making this suggestion, if they indeed made this suggestion, found it necessary to inform the person who was appointed before  he was appointed that he was going to be appointed, so the benefit was not a contribution towards good governance, the benefit was to demonstrate that they had knowledge of the appointment before the appointment occurs.     Correct.     Correct yes.    Yes.     Yes, sir intelligence we make use of the word called created dependencies.     Created dependencies.    I am absolutely convinced that the need for the Gupta brothers to tell Minister Fikile Mbalula that he was going to be theMinister of Sport was to determine a created dependency.  That crated dependency was to extract value from him being the Minister of Sport and of course if one looks at the business investment of the Gupta’s there were in cricket, in sport stadiums.  So the benefit was to extract value.  If he was made the Minister of Water you know well I do not know but you know they are – if he was made the Minister of Water I do not think they would have informed him.  The Portfolio of sport is related to their business interest and they needed to create dependency of him onto them so that when they do come back on the value that he would felt obliged to respond because of the created dependency and please do not get me wrong Sir I am not saying that it happened.  I am saying the mechanism by which we from Intelligence would have seen it.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    Ys.   I understand.    Thank you.      Chair you will recall that at the particular time in – in multilateral affairs the US administration under then President Barak Obama was engaging with negotiations in respect of Iran to lift the sanctions that was in place on Iran because of the attempts with the Iranian government to build its nuclear facilities outside of the regulatory proceedings.  I was approached…   Yes.    Yes.    Sir the – you will recall that after our Monday morning foreign meetings we had lunch with our Deputy Director Generals.   We agreed on the investigation.  It was supported by our Director – Deputy Director Generals and related to that investigation is another aspect which – which I am …    Yes correct.    Correct.    Yes    Correct.    Correct.    So in relation I was approached by the then US Ambassador stationed in Pretoria that the state department is concerned about the possible funding of Shiva Uranium which is a Gupta owned mine and they had reason to believe that such financing may be coming from Iran.  And they are concerned.  This is – when I say they I mean the United States is concerned because it is a very sensitive time in the negotiations with Iran in regard to the – the discussions about lifting of the sanctions and coming up with a newapproach to Iran and if this is the case then they did not know whether to interpret this as Iran going rogue or what – what is the situation and could we determine whether Iranian funding is in fact behind Shiva Uranium?    The consequence for South Africa would have been enormous. 1. We would have been seen to be going rogue in violation of multinational multilateral agreements and such violations wouldhave consequences.  And of course it would be an enormous financial consequence to the country if sanctions were then by necessarily extended to South Africa. So it was another aspect of intelligence that needed to be dealt with.  And this is a very good example of how intelligence services work.  Although in this case the approach was from the state department to me via the Ambassador and – and in my evidence I also point and I am sure it is going to be led by Director Ngange that they too were approached directly by the American Intelligence to – to determine the source of this funding on the Uranium mines.    That is correct.    That is correct.   The – I was…    That the – that the Iranians are not behind Shiva Uranium funding.    That is correct.    Yes.  The – I – I cannot recall whether it happened on the same day or the day after but a few days after that meeting that we took to investigate the Gupta family Mr Maqetuka informed both Ms Ngange and I that we are required to fly urgently to Cape Town where the Minister has summoned a meeting of us in Cape Town.  So we flew to Cape Town that evening and we arrived there at night for a meeting with the Minister.    Well this is the first that it has happened to me but during the period in which I was the Head of the Secret Service or the ForeignBranch of the SSA I was never called to explain an operation.  So this the first operation that Minister Cwele deemed it necessary for me or for us to come explain.    It is 2011.    Oh I think these are now in the latter months of 2011.   Because by 2012 I was history.    The – Chair I found it – I found it inappropriate.  I would go so far as to say illegal but then I would have required the courage to go and prove that illegality in a court and it was just going to be a messy affair.  But it is – it is not done like that.  The – the better way would have to been to await the outcome of the investigation and then dealt with the issues of the investigation.Dealt with the recommendations of the investigation.  But making known your view of an investigation on a matter of National Security when you are theMinister of National Security is an indictment also on your understanding of National Security.    Well the meeting was extremely confrontational –extremely confrontational.  The – you know the Minister…    Okay.  So the – when we arrived – so the Minister has a holding room.  We were in the holding room and the Minister then I think there was a meal provided for us and from there we went into the – the Minister’s meeting room.  The Minister attended that meeting with two people. One was appropriately now Ambassador Zlomo who is South Africa’s Ambassador to Algeria who at the time was a special advisor to the Minister.  And he attended – he also attended the meeting by Mr is it Doctor Kaw Mabangu – Kaw – there was a gentleman by the name of Doctor Kaw and I just – the surname just escapes me but I will get it.   No, no ..    Mavungo but I will check and I will give.    I will confirm the surname.    But there was Doctore Kaw and…    He is a member – he was – he was the Head of theMinisterial Services and a member of the service.  And in particular a member of the Foreign Service.  When we …    Yes which fell under me.    So when we started the meeting we objected to his presence on the basis that he is a junior official.  We are going to be discussing – because the Minister indicated that he wanted to discuss the Gupta matter.  I will – our Gupta investigation and I am not too sure whether it is the Director General who insisted or I insisted that – that Doctor Kaw please leave the room on the basis that he is an official from the service and we would not want to have that discussion.  Insofar as Ambassador Zlomo was concerned Ambassador Zlomo just returned from a – a posting at a multilateral – intelligence multilateralinstitution and we found it acceptable for him to present in the meeting insofar as him being an advisor to the Minister. But with no participation rights.    Yes he did agree to leave.    He agreed to leave ja.  So the Minister wanted to hear from Ambassador Maqetuka what the reasons behind the investigation were.  Ambassador Maqetuka took him through or thinking.    No, no you are showing your – you are showing your – your – you are showing your intelligence about intelligence matters.  The Minister was informed.    We have not yet…    No.    The Minister was informed by someone present at the meeting. We were unable to determine who informed the Minister but it was clear that the Minister was informed from a participant in the meeting.   Yes.    Correct.    So Ambassador Maqetuka led the – the argument and essentially which was the arguments that we have covered to now.    National security and I think in that meeting and againAmbassador Maqetuka will go into it.  But there were other noises around the – the Gupta family.    This matter needed to be investigated.  It was ultimately in the interest of the President that this investigation happens.  Because either the investigation is going to find that there is nothing to this story.  And if there is nothing to the story then the President is in a sense cleared by the Intelligence Services.  If there was something to the story then there were corrective action that could be taken.  But I must confess Chair that the Minister was having none of it.  Reason left the room when we entered and we could not find each other.  In fact it deteriorated where the Minister made this matter incredibly personal.  He argued that the reason why we doing this investigation is because we want to pursue or further the business objectives of Mr Njenje.  We all at this time in fairness to Mr Njenje I have never seen him moreangry than I have seen him in that meeting.  Ambassador Maqetuka denied that.  I denied that.  We were not furthering the business interest of Director Njenje.  In fact when we had our early morning discussion it was Director Njenje who placed on record his conflict and what his involvement or – and I will not say involvement – his interaction with how it came to be that he interacted with the Gupta’s and what was behind it etcetera.  And we were very satisfied with his explanation.  And if anything in deference to him he wanted us to ensure that that does not feature in the investigation.  So if anything it was completely the opposite to what the Minister was alleging.  Againwe tried to explain to the Minister and the again the Minister did not listen.  It seemed to me that the Minister did not want this investigation to happen.  For reasons that I am sure the Minister would explain.  I can only but speculate but he did not want this investigation to happen and the meeting was incredibly tense.    Correct.    I am – I am – for me and again I will speculate I think it goes again to one of the reasons why you should not have a Minister of Intelligence.  Because a Minister serves at the favour or behest of a President and therefore would seek to either ingratiate themselves orwould seek to get favour from a President.  The Director General of an Intelligence Services serves the national interest of the country and often those two things the National – serving the national interest versus serving the favours of a President may not be …    They may not coincide. And I think this is a – a classical example where the national interest was undermined in order for favour.    To best of my understanding I think it could have been a hour to about two hours.    An hour to two hours.    I think he also gave the reason that he did not deem it necessary that in terms of the media scoping etcetera he did not see that the scoping exercise that we did in respect of you know this is what is being said in the media, he did not see it threatening NationalSecurity.  He did not see it as we seen it.  The – and he was I think willing to say that these are matters that have – political matters that the report in the paper – political matters which should not require attention.  And he – I actually got the sense that the Minister did not believe that which was being alleged was in fact turned out to be true.  So I do not think he believed the allegation.  And therefore he was dismissive of it.  Whereas we on the other hand did not take a view about whether the allegations in the media was to be believed or not believed.  We took the view that the matter should be investigated so that we could arrived at an objective understanding of what in fact occurred.    Absolutely correct and again not - not to take any perverse pleasure from this.  It did turn out to be correct.  It was a disaster and as a result I am sitting before you on a matter of State Capture and I think in - in fairness if we were allowed to do the investigation.  We maybe - we may - I am not saying it would necessarily be the case.  Wemay be talking about different things now.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.   Chair, I - I just want to sad that and in this case I would - I would be as direct as I could be.  The - I think it - it does constitute a dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister having assumed the function of the Minister and intervening in the way he did.  He - he did cause grievous harm to the wellbeing of the State, because immediately after this incident was of course the Waterkloof landing incident. Now I wonder - I mean the Waterkloof landing incident for me which is also of - of deep concern, because it was a - it is a - a military air force.  It is not a normal air force.  It is a military air force in which - you know.  To enter a military air force its airspace etcetera.  Requires a phenomenal amount of intervention. I think that was again a - an incredible narcissistic demonstration of power.  Unnecessary and it should not have happened.  It was a violation of National Security and if we wereallowed to have done our investigation the - I do not think you would have at least for sure you would have had the Watergate affair. I mean the Waterkloof affair.  I am also - I must say on - on record sir, because and I know I am stretching it here.  That is common practice of Ministers to assume the power and responsibility and the perks that come with the jobs of being Ministers, but then are the first to - to cry that they did not know when there are problems. How could you not know that an aeroplane was landing at a military airbase?  How could you not know and now I accept that Ambassador Bruce Koloane and I know him and he is a - a - he was agreat Ambassador.  He was a very effective Ambassador.  He was a very effective officer of protocol, but I think in one of your recommendations if you do indeed make recommendations DJ. That this notion where officials take the fall for the errors of their politicians.  I think we should bring that to an end.  We should bring that to an end.  Do not become a politician if you do not want to take responsibility.  Take the credit.  Take the risk, but also take the responsibility and the obligations that come with your office. Do not pass that obligation or do not pass the blame onto officials when you know that - you know - essentially you are - you - you are not owning up to your own responsibilities as Ministers and I think in both those cases these are classic examples where Ministers do not own up to the responsibility of their office.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Correct.    Hm.   Hm.    Thank you, sir.    Yes.  There was a - a debate about that, but by that time the meeting deteriorated.  With the Minister saying I am instructing you not to continue with this investigation and I think at that point we became uncharacteristically in the event - in the case of my twocolleagues uncharacteristically equally impolite. Saying we are going to investigate and we could not move past that point and then I think it was Ambassador Maqetuka who then made the suggestion that we would rather prefer to discuss this with the President directly.    No.  The matter was not resolved.  The - we did not accept not to - we did not - we did not accept to stop the investigation.  We did get the opportunity to get a meeting with the President and the Minister undertook to arrange that meeting with the President.  So the matter was so to speak pushed up the - the ranks for a discussion with the President.   Well I can only but assume that he may have received that information from the Guptas themselves.    The - the Gupta family at that time was deploying a large amount of security personnel and - and often the security personnel also engaged in information gathering.  Not of a very quality.  Mainlyspeculation and rumour mongering etcetera and I did pick up that the Gupta family had a kind of intelligence operation going, but I did not put much reliance on it and I must say I should have. Much to my detriment, but I did not put any much reliance on it and in fact subsequently I found out that it was done that intelligence capability that informed the President that there is a possible grouping of people who want to - to topple him.  In fact I too was accused of being one of the people who was planning to topple President Zuma.    It is around 2011.  Ja.    2011.      Late 2011.  Ja.    The - the position to the best of my recall is that the Minister does not have that authority.  We will continue with this investigation subject to a discussion with the President.    Coldly.   Coldly.  I think we all got up and none of us said our goodbyes in a very polite manner and we just left.    Later it was cold.    Hm.    That is correct.    We were of the opinion that we will continue with the investigation.  That the justification that we had was - was legitimate and that the justification for the - the investigation was legitimate andwarranted the investigation and that we should get the investigation going. However we wanted to meet with the President, because by making the - the position that the Minister does not have authority over the - the direct operations and who does.  Of course the President does and we therefore wanted to raise this matter directly with the President to continue this - this operation.    Okay.    No.  I have not seen it.   Okay.    Yes.  Good.    That is correct.    No, no.  I said at least two hours.    Ja.    And there was dinner and so forth.  So - ja.    Yes.    No, no.  There was dinner before the meeting.  (Intervenes).    So it went on quite late.    Ja.    Correct.   That is correct.  Ja.    About two hours.    Ja.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    We …    Ja.    No.  I - I do not see a substantially different.    The - the …    Well the Minister was insisting that we do not continuewith the investigation.  That is …    That is what I was recalling.  Yes.    Ja.    And he was giving reasons …    That the investigation is related to the business interests of Director Njenje and we were arguing that it is the National Securityimperative that is driving the investigation or the need for the investigation.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.  I mean I am - and also I must say that as the Head of the Foreign Branch I was not directly in the firing line so tospeak.  I was there in the support line and the - the Minister would if he was going to instruct.  The Minister could have written this in a letter to say. I hereby instruct you not to engage in this investigation and I - best of my recollection I do not think that happened, but what I understood from the forcefulness from which the Minister was debating with us the manner of the debate.  The - the level of his questioning.  He in no uncertain term expressed an incredible unhappiness about our wanting to investigate and I read from that that he wanted us not to investigate and I - I viewed that as an instruction not to investigate.    Huh-uh.    Sure.    There is no debate about that.    No, no, no.  At least from my point of view.    No debate about that.    Correct.    Yes.  Correct.    Correct.    We believe that the - as a result of the analysis of open source information that we had and other information that there was a justifiably warranted investigation that should be conducted by the Intelligence Services with its full capacity into the Guptas.  The Minister’s position was that he did not think that the evidence warranted an investigation and he expressed his unhappiness to us in - in no uncertain terms about our desire to continue with that investigation.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I am sorry, sir.    Oh no.  Oh no.  Not - not …     I thought at one moment in the discussion that the way we put our argument was compelling and that he would have to agree to do this, but the – he opened the door slightly that yes this may warrant a look into it, but then he closed that door immediately and focused againon Njenje, so at that point we were lost.     Yes.     That is correct.     One example that comes to mind is that when the Minister started to give reasons but it is Mr Njenje’s business interests that’s driving this investigation, and not the National Security imperative, Minister – I mean Ambassador Maqetuka countered by saying butDirector Njenje explained fully and fully disclosed this to us and we are convinced that it has nothing to do with his business interests at all.The, I think Director Njenje entered the discussion as well and tried to convince the Minister that this is absolutely not the case and the Minister was having none of it so at some point the Minister said no, no, no, you know you are conflicted on this matter you know and the debate went around and around whether there was a conflict or was there no conflict, whether the business interest was driving the investigation or not but the Minister did not want to listen to the fact that we needed to investigate the Guptas, did not want, did not.    Ja, at the level of the discussion I am trying to now just to a memory recall, the level of the interaction between us as Director Generals and him as Minister often there is a language that is spoken amongst you know the – if I express my unhappiness on a matter I am literally telling you you are not going to proceed any further, and I on the other hand will tell you no I am going to proceed further.     You now pushed it to the barrel where the next step is the written word, the “I instruct you not to do this”.   I think we were becoming close to the written word.     But the disagreement was tactfully around a very important mandate, do you Minister have the authority to instruct on an operation or not, and we were you know you can say what you want to say but we are going to continue this and the only person who can tell us not to do this is the President, because he is responsible for the direction of the Intelligence Services so we avoided an overt confrontation with the Minister or an absolute breakdown where it now has to go to the passage of letters and I up to stage do not know whether letters did cross the table.     And our way out was with the meeting with the President.     Yes, yes correct.     Correct, that is so.     That is correct sir.     And again I would repeat in my understanding interpretation language the culture of Intelligence the Minister was unambiguous in his unhappiness about the investigation and as a result the view that we were left with was that he does not want thisinvestigation to continue.     There is no doubt about that.     None whatsoever.     That will be fine.     Sure I will make arrangements     Ja.     Twenty five past?    Yes to the best of recall yes and of course it was now that I look back on it the Minister was drawing extensions from – from an investigation into the Gupta’s that may extend to possibly investigation into the President.  My – my recall and I think the – the argument that we made is that that is not necessarily the case.  We are investigating the Gupta’s in – and whatever ramifications will come of it will come out of it.  And of course it is then up to the – the President or the Minister how to then deal with the recommendations that will be made.  The – the fear that the investigation may extend to the President again was unwarranted.  But the Minster was not clear in the reason why he did ot want this investigation to stop.  He just – it seemed to me at least thathe was of the view that he is going to come, provide a meal, have a discussion with us that this is going to end and it was going to end like that.  So I think he was also taken aback by the – the belief that we had that this is a National Security issue.    Yes.    Correct.   Absolutely not.  The – and in fact a proper investigation would allude to the conflict of interest to the extent that it needed to be placed on record.  The – so even that was – was not a reason to stop the investigation.    Yes now Sir the – the Mr Njenje would not be directlyinvolved in the investigation.    His personnel, his people and the entire service in terms of the required components would.      So there would have been a measure as it should always be [indistinct] intelligence investigation a measure of objectivity.  So even to that extent I felt the – the Minister’s concerns were – were somewhat irrational to put it – put it mildly.  There was no case to stop it.  Even if you looked at the methodology nothing in the methodologywould have led to the investigation being compromised or prejudiced or biased in any way.    It – it did indeed.  The…    To the best of my understanding again memory is a faulty thing I believe that meeting occurred the next day or the day after.  But we did not return to Pretoria we stayed in Cape Town and then attended the meeting the next day.    We met at the President’s residence in Cape Town.      At the meeting was the – we waited first for the President.  So at that meeting was Ambassador Maqetuka.  Was Director Njenjeand myself and then we were joined by the President.    Yes.  The – the President welcomed us.  We were all seated.  I did get a sense that he was briefed about why we were there and obviously he knew that it was about the matter of the Gupta investigation.  But the President started off with a discussion on essentially what is called the – I got to get this pronunciation right – the Richard Mdluli Report.  There was a…   Yes.    The – that report and I do not know whether evidence of that was led before the commission yet?    Okay.    The report essentially was a report conducted by Police Crime Intelligence when Mr Mdluli was the head of Crime Intelligence and it eluded to a – a possible gathering of ANC people who were planning in New Castle to topple the – the President Zuma.  And we –     Yes.     Correct. So     It is that report I am referring to.    The Director General under the – the leadership of the Director General an investigation into that report was conducted by the SSA.    Yes by Ambassador Maqetuka.   He initiated a report because again and I do not want to – to lead his evidence but he was called by the – the Judge in charge of interception who raised a certain concern about the number of interceptions that are occurring in the police and there seems to be something not right in the police service.  Ambassador Maqetuka in his capacity as a DG of SSA subjected the – the Ndluli Report to a veracity test to see how truthful this report is.  Is there anything in this report that is correct or accepted?      Yes.  Correct.    In New Castle that is correct.    Yes, ja.  Correct.    Correct.    No.    The Mdluli Report is the report that spoke of that meeting in New Castle, Escort.   Yes.  We do not know where the newspapers got it.    That is correct.    To the President.    And to the – and to the Minister of Intelligence.  The Minister of State Security as I understand it.    Yes.    So we – so Ambassador Maqetuka subject to that report toa veracity test to see whether elements of that report is truthful or not truthful.  And the conclusion…    That a grouping of people came together Ministers, non-Ministers came together in either New Castle or Escort and they had a meeting about how to topple President Zuma.    Yes.    So that report – our report or the domestic branch’s report on that report was submitted via the office of Ambassador Maqetuka to the Minister and then from the Minister to the President.    Of the claims within the Mdluli Report correct.    The SSA yes.    That is correct yes.    Right. So the President starts with our report on the Mdluli Report in the meeting that we now have.  And he says that he has read our report unfortunately he believes the Mdluli Report.    And so too does the Minister believe the Mdluli Report.    And he finds that our report not to be standing the test of time.  The – so in other words he was rejecting our report.    And accepting the Mdluli Report.   Indeed it was.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    No.  To the best of my recall he did not.  He pronouncedthat he believes the Mdluli Report.  And of course that set the tone of our meeting because essentially our report that rejected the Mdluli Report was now being rejected by the President who we are directly responsible to providing intelligence to.    Correct.    And analysis.    No in the intelligence world that is considered a – again I am trying to find the polite word.  It is considered to be a lack of confidence.    The – that when a President who is ultimately responsible it is different the President saying is – I do not accept your position or I do not accept your view about a particular matter. But when you havewritten a report and in which you say that the allegations contained by that element within government – and if you remember it is Crime Intelligence and he says, no he agrees with the Crime Intelligence Report he is just – it is a vote of no confidence in your capacity.  So we were all taken aback.  I was taken aback because as I have said I have a long history with President Zuma especially in matters of intelligence.  And on matters of intelligence he would know that you know all of us have a long history, all of us have a long working history with him and that if our views are rejected it is a tough one to deal with.      Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    The – to my recall Ambassador Maqetuka outlined ourinvestigation, the reasons for our investigation.  He had a document with him outlining the scan for the reason the investigation.  He took the President through the discussion that we have had with the Minister.  The acrimonious discussion with the Minister and said to the President that we are here to say that we should conduct this investigation into the Gupta family.  The President and I must say with all due respect to the President he did not go off the handle, he did not scream or shout, he said fine he hears us.  But he would like to explain the Gupta family to us.  And the President went into a rather long explanation about the Gupta family of how he first met them.  Of howthey were of assistance to Duduzane Zuma when no-one was going to employ Duduzane.  How they have helped him in certain of his own trials and tribulations.  And he – they are simply a – a business family and that they were in fact introduced to the ANC and to people in government rather by people associated with President Mbeki and it is – you know – so they are not a – a creation of his own making but this is a continuation of a – a relationship that existed through the passage of time starting with the Mbeki administration.  So he had a very long – he was very calm – he was very clear, very pointed in – in all of the issues leaving and saying to us that he did not think that there was an issue to be investigated.  You know because he understands all the matters connected to the Gupta family.  We listened very painfully – patiently. I cannot recall whether we pushed back but it was clear to me that and later when I checked with the others that President Zuma in no uncertain terms expressed his preference for no investigation tocontinue.    No that – that matter was discussed previously with him and I.  He may have alluded to it in this meeting but that was a previously – he may alluded to it.  That is a lot of speculation and rumours about the Gupta’s but you know this is not the case.  They are very good business people etcetera.  And that there are a lot of rumours around them.  And of course it was associated to the – and part of a victimisation narrative.  A victimisation narrative and meaningthat – and this is what hurt me more that investigation into the Gupta’s is because people wanting to get to him as the President.  So he saw it as a part of a victimisation narrative and of course what was surprising and I say hurtful to me because I have had a long personal history with President Zuma and so did Maqetuka and so did Gibson and we were speaking to him in his capacity as President but not unmindful of his own long history in intelligence.  And as an intelligence officer he should have understood what we were saying that you know this is a matter of National Security and if you could simply put your own feeling aside for the moment and see it as National Security we would then be able after the investigation to deal with the issues insofar as it pertains to him. But I got a sense by the time President Zuma was very much wedded to the narrative that there are people trying to topple him.  There are – you know spies around every corner who is trying to set him up and – and it is not really about the Gupta’s at the end of the dayit is about him.  So it was – as he continued to speak it became a very uncomfortable discussion for us because I could not – I could not categorically say in my own mind that he was actually saying that we are part of those who want to topple him.  But I – I was left with that feeling and it did make me for the first time uncomfortable.  And this is a – a – a relationship of many decades with President Zuma and myself and I never imagined that I would ever be in that position where I would have to doubt whether he actually trusts me or not.  So it felt odd and awkward for me personally.  And I am sure it must have felt like that for the others as well.   Yes if I recall he mentioned that Duduzane at some point went to India for studies and then stayed with the Gupta family or got to know the Gupta family there.  And then when he came back they continued that relationship.  And he elaborated that this was a relationship that you know did not begin today, did not begin when he was a President and begun a long time ago.  And perhaps it even reached its height at the time where he was most in despair and it is not related to him being President.  The – so I got – I got firmly he – and of course I have heard this before and he repeated it.  But this time he repeated it in the narrative of people wanting to topple him and etcetera.    No.  The – the basis for the investigation was simple.  It was in our opinion a breach at the highest level of the land.  And the breach again is either it was information peddling on their part.  A leak from the President’s office or a suggestion by them for the appointment of a Minister.  And in our understanding of intelligence it was clear in at least my mind that they were attempting to engage in created – creating dependency and often you create dependency to extract value.    Yes they were conveyed to the former President.    The President in no uncertain terms expressed his positive sentiment towards the Gupta’s and in the context of the narrative that he outlined that the – that there were attempts to topple him that – I can only but read into the matter that it was the non-verbal way of instructing us not to continue with the investigation.  And I – I left – I left the meeting with no uncertain terms that this investigation should not continue.  Not because it was necessitated but because this is the wish of the President that it should not happen.   Correct.    Yes he did not say, stop this investigation    Correct.    Shamefully I would have to say something rather shamefulhere that I think we left the meeting with the view that the investigation should not continue.  And if it does continue it is going to continue at the cost of our jobs.  But of course we also left the meeting with the view that our relationship with the Minister had broken down.  Now our relationship with the President has broken down and in – in not so polite language stuff was going to hit the fan rather soon.  So we – we – I do not know whether the – the domestic branch is going to continue the investigation or not but I think we were of the view that we will not continue the investigation.    I think the – the President was – he disregarded his own experience in this matter.  He disregarded the collective professional advice of three of the top senior Directors and Director Generals of theintelligence community that was advising that there is a legitimate and warranted basis for investigation.  And I think in that regard he did not properly apply his mind to – to his obligation to – to provide effective and efficient direction of the Intelligence Services.  And I think – I think the country has paid the price as a result thereof.    Well I think the – to have the President reject your advise is – is – when you are the – in the top echelons of the intelligence services a very difficult thing to deal with.  Because like I have said itis – it is – you are appointed as a Head of an Intelligence Services because you believe that you have certain qualities and one of the important qualities of an intelligence head is the ability not only to lead a service but to able to manage information discreetly with discretion, with analysis and when a Head of an Intelligence Service and when three of them say to you that Sir we think this investigation is warranted and for the President to say, in not so many words, no it is not.  It is – it is a – it is a big thing in the intelligence world.  It is a put down that you would spend lots of hours reflecting on.  Because it is a fundamental breach of the trust relationship between you and the President.    The Crime Intelligence.   Yes.    Two units.    Correct.    That is correct.   That is correct.    Yes.    And - and what was unique in our situation that Mr Maqetuka or Ambassador Maqetuka had the full authority of a Director-General in SSA.    He is the Accounting Officer.    Director Njenje at the time was a Director - appointed atthe level of a Director-General.    An Accounting Officer …    And so to was I an Accounting Officer.    Whereas the Crime Intelligence Division …    Is a Division …    Of a large organisation in which there are many …    SAPS in which there are many divisions.  So …    Again it is the level of the Director-General’s is much higher than the level of a divisional head.    Yes.    It is three.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.   Correct.    We did.  We did, sir.    The - and of course the - added to the matter is the long histories that we have with the - with President Zuma.    We have advised him through many parts of his life.  When he was the Head of Intelligence.  When …    Yes and when - in the ANC.    And when he had certain difficulties …    And now that he was the President.  So …    You - you may not be happy on the way I presented …    My - my advice …    But what you would have to accept is that …    The sincerity of my advice …    Cannot be …    Questioned …    And I think we felt that he questioned the sincerity …    Of our advice and that made - made us feel …    Uncomfortable …    And in the - in the world of New Age and the world which we should live in.  In the world of empathy it was difficult to deal with.    That is correct.  It was very civil.  Very polite …    And I would add one more.  It was prescriptive.   Yes.  In the sense that the President was speaking.    Giving his views.  We were listening.    Where we could push back we pushed back ...[intervenes]     But ...[intervenes]     The more he spoke the more we retreated.    Into the position of ...[intervenes]     It would - it would be a proper description.    To the extent that we were listening more.    As the - President Zuma spoke more ...[intervenes]     But I think he understood ...[intervenes]     The reason why we were arguing that there should be aninvestigation.    That I - I was left with no uncertain at least in my mind and for a couple of reasons.  One is that we were articulate.  The second, the reasons we gave were compelling and thirdly that given his own experience in Intelligence that he knew what we were talking about.    No.  He did not.    No.    No.  He did not.    That is - that is the way I - I saw it.    That he was giving this long explanation so that we could be persuaded to the believe that no - no investigation …    Was necessary.    Of course he added it in the context of the narratives todispose him and the victimisation …    Narrative.    Which - which made it difficult for us to push back on …    Because here is a President telling you that people are trying to topple me.  I am giving you an explanation that my relationship with this family is - is untoward and if you are pushing back on reason why we - we need to investigate the family.  It is - it is as if he is saying that, but you are the guys who want to topple me.    He did not say stop.    That is the correct … (intervenes).    Yes.  His view was against it.    Or put better he did not think it necessary.    Given the fact that he was providing the …   The background to … (intervenes).    Yes.    Yes.  That - that did occur to me in all …    Honesty.    No.  He did not say that.    Yes and do not forget sir that we are - we are Intelligence Officers in our own right.    And joining the dots …    Is not a difficult exercise.    At that - that level.    So one of the dots that was joined in my mind …    And I am not speaking on behalf of anyone else.    In my mind that pushing this investigation further …    Was going to lead in my view …    To the President concluding …   That we are part of those now …    Ja.  The fictional or non-fictional and - and I must say …    That it is fictional …    But it was going to lead …    To that.  Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.  I mean the - the Constitutional states it.  The - quite categorically under Section 2-0-9-(2).    “The President is the Head of the National Executive.  Must appoint a woman or a man as the Head of each Intelligence Service established in terms of subsection 1 and must either assume political responsibility for the control and direction …”   “…direction of any of the services or designate a Member of Cabinet to do so.”   So the President does have - he does have the power …    To direct …    And of course and this is perhaps something that arising out of your - your own report sir would be to tease out this definition of political responsibility.  What does political responsibility mean, but that is - is an issue that we should park for - for your report, but in my view the President has the power to direct the Intelligence Services.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Hm.    Sir …    In - in the matter of governance in relation to all of this with Ambassador Maqetuka it is easy.  You can go above to the Minister …    And - and then convince the Minister that that investigation needs to happen etcetera.  If - and if there was no Minister you can go to the President and justify an investigation or an official or another Minister, because in effect that is what happens on Counter Intelligence investigations, but when it comes to a matter pertaining to the President himself where - that is where the Constitution the law is alsosilent, because it was never a situation envisaged and even if it was envisaged the way to deal with the matter I have no other - no - I cannot think of any other way. I can think about whistleblowing.  I can think about providing this kind of information to - to the Joint Standing Committee of Intelligence, but all of them would come up with the same problem and this beggars the question that has always been the case.  Who guards the guardians and that is the essence you are dealing with here.    91.    Yes.    But conflicted.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.
