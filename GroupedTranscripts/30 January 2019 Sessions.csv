CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Before we start I just need to say something.  Since the commencement of Mr Agrizzi′s evidence there have been a number of people who were mentioned by him in his evidence who have written to the Commission complaining that the Commission did not warn them in advance about his evidence namely that he was going to implicate them. The Commission will be responding and is responding to them, but it seems that it is necessary that I mention that on the first day on which Mr Agrizzi gave evidence there was an application that I had here at the hearing in which the legal team of the Commission explained why advance warning had not been given to implicated persons. They gave reasons in open and at the end thereof I indicated that I would not make a decision on whether or not there was justification for not giving advance warning, but I indicated that on the face of what I had been told it did appear that there was justification, but I said that I would leave the issue, without deciding it to enable any implicated person who wished to make an issue of the lack of advance warning to do so in due course and then I would deal with the matter at that stage. That is the first point that I want to clarify.  The second point is that the legal team made it clear that except for the advanced warning and the fact that the statement or affidavit of Mr Agrizzi was not given to implicated persons ahead of his evidence.  Apart from that all their rights as set out in the rules of the Commission would be observed and that in due course they would be given relevant portions of the statement or affidavit so that they could deal with the allegations against them. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 So I just want to make that announcement again, because it does appear that not everybody appreciated the explanation as to why advance warning was not given, was given here in open and that indeed there is no intention on the part of the Commission not to allow people who are implicated an opportunity to respond to the relevant portions of Mr Agrizzi′s statement. And there is also no intention on the part of the Commission to preclude anybody from initiating any processes in terms of the rules of the Commission in order to protect their rights and interests.  One of the letters we have received says that there is no guarantee that the Commission would recall Mr Agrizzi once he has finished his evidence, but anyone who was listening yesterday or watching would have heard at the end of Mr Agrizzi′s evidence what I said. Mr Agrizzi himself indicated his continued preparedness to come back and give evidence.  So people must know that – they must just follow the rules and the Commission will make sure that their rights are not infringed in terms of those rules.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius, you may proceed.    Yes.    Yes, yes, thank you.    Mr van Tonder you are still under the same oath that you took yesterday, so I am just mentioning that, I will not be mentioning it each time until you finish your evidence, you are under the same oath.    Okay.    Do you want to give us an example or two of the types of invoices that would fall under this category which you had to be careful about?    Built for whom?    Okay.    Was it a correct reflection of the position?  To reflect those expenses in that way, was it correct?    Yes, okay.    Yes?    But at the time of the actual purchase of the vehicle and maybe delivery thereof would you have been reflected in the books of the dealer as the buyer of the car or not?  Who would have been reflected as the buyer?    So when you transferred money was it the full purchase price that you transferred to the dealer from your account?    So when you transferred the money from your own personal account to the dealer it would have been on behalf of Mr Gillingham′s daughter or Mr Gillingham?    Okay, so in terms of the books of the dealer the purchaser remained either Mr Gillingham or his daughter, whoever it was that put his/her name?    In the name of the daughter?    Oh, okay, alright, thank you.    Do you know where that loan agreement is now?    Before you do that Mr Pretorius this whole complicated transaction for a simple thing for just buying a car, at that stage did you understand what the purpose was of getting involved in all these transactions in regard to the purchase of Mr Gillingham′s car?    What was the purpose?    Without Bosasa appearing as having paid for the car?    In other words to conceal the true identity of the person who paid for the car or the entity that paid for the car?    Yes, thank you.    You said a minute ago that the project was founded by Bosasa Operations and then you changed and you said Bosasa Group.  Is that, because you wanted to correct what you say at paragraph 39?  In other words is there a difference between the Bosasa Group and Bosasa Operations Pty Limited?  Did you intend to say it was anyone or more of the companies under the Bosasa Group as opposed to saying it was Bosasa Operations Pty Limited?  I just want to make sure that you are aware of what you had said in the statement and what you have said in oral evidence.    Oh, okay, thank you.    I see that you mention that on a certain occasion President Zuma was invited to this project and that is where you were introduced to him, for President Zuma.  Now there has been evidence that that Mr Gavin Watson used to indicate that he had interactions with him.  Was this the only time that you witnessed a visit by former President Zuma to a Bosasa project or Bosasa premises?    [Intervenes].    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    Before, before that Mr Pretorius.  At the time that you were interacting with SARS in regard to this project that we have just dealt with.  Did you believe that it was a genuine project at that time or did you know that it was intended for something else, for unlawful purposes?    You believe now or you did believe at the time of interacting with SARS that it was meant for unlawful purposes?  That is what I want to know whether it is, it is the belief you formed after or whether even as you were interacting with SARS you did believe or you knew that it was meant for unlawful purposes.    Okay.  Thank you.        So chicken was a code for cash?    And was it not being called cash or money because it was for bribery?    Okay.    Did you say AT3?    Oh AT3.    Okay, okay.    I see you said that these payments were made prior to the invoices but in your statement you say prior or on the dates of invoices.  Do you stick with prior to or sometimes prior, sometimes on?    We will take the tea adjournment and we will resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes, Mr Pretorius?    He just wants you to confirm whether it is true whether you have confirmed that you took the video and that you have told me why you took it.  So if you remember that you have told me you say yes, if you do not remember you say no I do not remember telling the, Chair.    How would there be any recording of the amount you put into that safe each time you put money into it?  Would there be a recording of how much you would put in on what date in the safe?    No, I mean when you had gone out to collect cash.    And you came and took it to the safe that is in the walk-in vault of the secretary then when you put the money into the safe would you record or would somebody record how much you put in on what date and when you took it out?  Would there be somebody who would record that?    Or by anybody?    Okay, alright.    One is a what safe?    Okay, thank you.    When you say three other it suggest that it is more than three, is it four is it three?    Okay.    Yes, there is a safe in the company secretary′s vault.    One safe and in Mr Gavin Watson′s vault there are three safes, that is what you are saying?    Okay.    Okay, thank you.    That is – is that the father of the daughter or the lady…[intervenes]    That Bosasa bought a car for in terms of the evidence you have given us?    Okay.    Let us take it step by step.  With regard to Equal Trade and you will tell me later on whether the same applied to other entities that you may have collected cash from, but just Equal Trade, I think your evidence was that – I do not know whether all the time, but was that you collected the cash from Lanseria, is that right?    A shopping centre close to Lanseria?    Now when you went there did you know how much you were going to collect, how much was going to be handed over to you?    How would you know?    So would your knowledge be based on paperwork?    That would have preceded this stage?    Including the order and so on and invoices?    Yes.  Now when you arrived at the shopping complex next to Lanseria to collect the cash would the cash – would the cash be minus the commission already?    Yes, yes.  And then you would then bring it to Bosasa?    You would go to the company secretary′s walk-in vault and you would put the money into one of the safes there?    And at that stage no recording took place as to how much you put in?    Yes.  And then you would only remove it to take it to Mr Gavin Watson′s safe?    And you would only do that when Mr Gavin Watson had instructed you to do that?    When you took it out from the safe in the company secretary′s vault again nobody would record what you took out and how much you took out, is that right?    Yes, oh, okay, alright.    Now, okay, when you received the cash at the shopping complex next to Lanseria would it be in a box or what, how would the cash – would it be in some box or in some bag or what?    Would the box be sealed?    Okay, so that if you interfered with it, it would show or not really?    Yes.    Okay, so you would then take the box with the cash from the company secretary′s safe and go to Mr Gavin Watson′s safe?    But when you did that would Mr Gavin Watson always be there when you were going to put the money into his safe or would you do it when he was not there sometimes?    Okay.    And then when you arrived there would there be a counting of the cash before it was put in between yourself and Mr Gavin Watson?    Yes, okay, thank you.    All of that came from – would be coming from Equal Trade?    Okay.    That was in addition to your normal salary?    And your normal salary was processed in the normal way salaries 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 are processed, EFT or whatever?    Yes, but this particular R20 000 that you are talking about which you got per month was paid to you in cash?    And who would give it to you?    Yes, and from when or by the time you left Bosasa were you still receiving this additional R20 000 per month cash?    So tell me the period that during which you received it if you are able to, from when to when did you get it or was it a once off payment this R20 000 cash yourself?    Yes.    Yes.  So you received a monthly payment of cash and the amounts differed because it increased over the years, but this type of payment to you ended when?  If you can remember.    Are you saying you received these cash payments until 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 November 2017?    And these payments had started in 2005 if you recall?    More or less there?    Yes, do you recall about how much it was when it started?    And then it increased over the years?    And do you recall when it started to reach R20 000 a month?    2013/2014 thereabout?    And then it continued as R20 000 up to the time, up to November 2017?    Yes.  November 2017 is that when you left Bosasa?    Okay, thank you.    Yes?    Okay, thank you.    Did you always receive this additional cash from Mr Gavin Watson personally or did you get it from somebody else within Bosasa on other occasions?    Would give it to you?    Okay.  Okay, thank you.    Let me just take you back to what we were talking about a minute 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 ago, the extra cash, monthly cash.  What was your understanding of what the purpose was of this extra cash that you were being paid every month?    Did he say that – did that coincide with when he would be giving you this monthly cash or not really?    Okay, thank you.    So, but are you saying that the SIU got information that there were people outside of Bosasa for whom Bosasa had paid for their travels, travelling and before the SIU could lay their hands on the documents proving that you were instructed to destroy them?    Ja.  Okay.  What would be the ranks as far as you recall in terms of what you knew then before the records were, were destroyed?  What would be the ranks of the type of people who Bosasa was paying, for whose travelling Bosasa was paying via Blakes Travel, the officials?  What, what ranks are we talking about?    Oh, you did not know the names?    Oh, you just knew it was VIP officials.    In Government.    That is all you knew? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    But do you know whether or so it is, it was completely different information that was put on the invoices compared to the information that had been destroyed?    Okay.    Mr Pretorius I have, made a correction and Mr van Tonder on 79, because it says Mr Mansell was immigrating.  I think it was intending to emigrate.    Ja, so I just.    Ja.    Hm, ja.    Ja.  You intended emigrating.    Hm.    From South Africa.    But the first sentence of 79 cannot be, it would not be correct if he is 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 immigrating.  The way it is, it is.    It has to be emigrating.    Ja.    Well the witness has hinted as emigrated from South Africa.    Ja.    Just repeat the purpose of you accompany Mr Mansell to the USA.    What was contemplated you would do if he changed his mind at a practical level?    Alright.    Yes, Mr Pretorius.    Huh-uh.    Did he have any prior connection with the USA?    Yes.  He, he as a South African citizen?    Ja and he has as far as you knew he had always been based in South Africa?    Yes.  Did he also know why he was been accompanied by you?  Why you were accompanying him?    You do not know?    Okay, thank you.    Yes.    Yes, did you want to read it?    Ja.    Is that the one you wanted to talk about Mr van Tonder?    Okay, do.    Ja that is the second paragraph from the end of the email?    Okay.  Yes.    Do you, do you, do you know what arrangements had been made if any before Mr Mansell left for the US as to how he would be accommodated there and so on?  Are you aware what arrangements had been made?  What was going to happen?  Was he going to buy property in general and try acquire citizenship or what was to happen?    Yes, but when you arrived there with him did you stay in a hotel on arrival?    Or were there other arrangements that had been made?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and you would have come back after what, after a week or something yourself?    Ja.  More or less in a week’s time, after a week or how long did you spend.    In the US at the time?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    There was no operation that he was involved in, in the US for Bosasa?    Hm.    Yes, okay.  Actually this document is dated 21 February 2017.  Is that right?    Hm.    It, it purports to be on a Bosasa letterhead.  Is that a normal Bosasa 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 letterhead?    Okay.  Thank you.    At the time you left Bosasa do you know whether this monthly amount of US$7 000 was still being paid to Mr Mansell?    Okay.  Every month he would send what purported to be an invoice and it was on the base of that that payment would be made?    Thank you.    I am sorry to take you back to Mr Mansell again Mr van Tonder.  Is your evidence that as far as you could tell Mr Mansell was not happy about going to the US or you do not know?    Yes.    Okay, thank you.  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.    You said that Mr Gavin Watson donated Synchro Prop to you and Mr Agrizzi as an incentive?    As an incentive to do what?    Did you get any benefits out of it yourselves that is yourself and Mr Agrizzi?    Okay, thank you.    You said you were all worried after you received this SIU report in Paris but you did say that Mr Gavin Watson boasted that his name did not appear in the report?    So he was worried to the extent that his organisation was implicated in wrongdoing?    Okay thank you.    Yes.    Should we not finish his evidence I see we are what two pages away or three?    Or is that not convenient?  You would prefer to continue after.    Are you happy to let us finish?    Okay I am assuming Mr Pretorius it might take about ten, fifteen minutes or do you think it will take longer?  You are hesitant to commit yourself.    Ja okay alright.    Do you remember round about when this would have been?  In terms of year?    Will clarify, okay, no that is fine.  Thank you.    Yes.    Okay, no that is fine.  We will take the lunch adjournment and when we come back Mr Pretorius still has some questions for you in regard to some matter    Yes, Mr Pretorius.    Your mic.    [Intervenes], I am sorry Mr Pretorius I though you said 81, but when I look at 81 it does not look like we are on the same page.    [Intervenes].    30, 3-0?    Okay.    Incidentally I see that 81 does appear to have Mr Watson’s signature.  Remember we have been told that he avoided signing documents.  It is not on the page you are referring to.  That is much earlier Mr Pretorius, but.    That is an aside.  That is an aside.    You said 3-0.    Yes, I have got it.    Mr van Tonder did you leave during the same, did you leave Bosasa the same month as Mr Agrizzi?    Ja.    You left in, I thought you said you left in November 2017.    Did he not leave the same month or he left in December of the same year?    Oh, oh okay; but I got the impression when he was giving evidence that the two of you appeared to have been quite close and maybe to be still quite close.  Is that right?    Yes.  Had that been the case for many years before you left, you both left Bosasa?    Oh, okay.  Okay.  No, thank you very much.    Okay.  Mr van Tonder for now I will release you.  As Mr Pretorius indicated you may be required to come back and there may be implicated parties who might apply for leave to cross-examine you and there might well be other evidence that you, it might be decided you should come and give.  So, but for now I will release you.  I just want to say thank you very much for coming forward to giving evidence to this Commission.  You did indicate in your evidence that you are fearful, but I just want to thank you for coming forward to help the Commission.  Thank you very much.  You are excused for now.    Thank you.    Okay.  We will take, we will adjourn for 10 minutes.  We will be back at 25 to three.    We adjourn.    Yes Adv Zinhle Buthelezi.    The affidavits?    I have got Mr Vorster’s statement, is that the one?    Ja.    I see Adv Zinhle Buthelezi that whereas Mr Agrizzi’s statement was an affidavit this one.    Well I do not know about that.  It says statement and it does not start with the usual – I declare under oath or I swear but the commission of oaths at the end in his or her certificate says that Mr Vorster did swear before him or her but …    It does not – Mr Vorster does not say in the statement that he took an oath.  It might not matter for present purposes I just noted the difference.    No I am – it might not be necessary I assume he will confirm that what is in the statement is true and correct and he will confirm under oath because he is under oath now.    And you have not been promised any reward for giving the evidence?    Thank you.    Around which year was this now?    2003?    Okay thank you.    Do you – do you remember whether during those days there would be some cash that you would hand over to Mr Gillingham every month or you cannot 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 say whether it was every month?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Do you – did you know what position Mr Gillingham held at Correctional Services at that time?    You mean he – there was one Provincial Commissioner for three 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 provinces you mean?    Oh.    Okay.  Thank you.    I am sorry ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI.  It looks like you might have skipped 11 which appears important or did I not hear him deal with it?    Ja paragraph 11.    Who made a presentation to whom?    Yes.    Senior management members of Correctional Services?    Okay alright.  Were you present in that presentation by any chance?    Okay alright.    Who was he making the presentation to?    And you say that presentation had been prepared by the Bosasa team?    Was through that presentation was it intended to persuade management of Correctional Services that outsourcing the catering functions was the right thing to do?    Okay.    Okay. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    What was R89 000,00?    Yes.    Yes.    That is the value of his car? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    That he sold to Bosasa?    And you bought it for that amount or for another amount?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay thank you.    So this one was for his son?    So now in the household of the Gillingham’s the father was driving a car bought by Bosasa.  His wife was driving a car bought by Bosasa.  The son was now also going to drive a car bought by Bosasa?    Second son?    Yes.    Ja but the father.    The mother and one of the sons?    Yes.    Ja okay alright.    This was now in February 2007 when you got the instruction?    Yes.    Yes.    To say you were partners?    What page?    Okay.    Yes.    That is Bosasa?    Yes.    But maybe before you get to the disciplinary hearing let us just get the journey that this money followed correctly.  Now this was – the money you are talking about is the money that was ultimately going to pay for the Mercedes – new Mercedes for Mr Gillingham, is that right?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Yes.    Ja where did it start and where?    Yes.    As a bonus?    Yes.    Ja.    And you did not want it to come to your account?    And what was the purpose of this zigzag trip on the – for this money?    Okay, okay.    So – but it reached Mr Gillingham’s account without going through your account?    Okay yes you may continue.    Just hang on Mr Vorster. Ms Buthelezi the …    This bundle is confusing now.  I thought that it had – it had the same pagination from beginning to end.    So how do you refer to – to the parts that are on this side?    To make sure there is no confusion on the transcript.    H’m.    So you have Exhibit T.    And then you have  30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Then you have T2.    T3.    T4.    And then do you start the pagination afresh each time?    Okay alright.    Yes.    So you say although we have here a document written – a notice to attend an enquiry and we have a document after that that is now page 19 of T. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Of T2.  We have one that says Final Written Warning and that says the warning was given to you in respect of a number of alleged offences written there. All this was just fabrication there was really no hearing and it was meant to protect the company in case there was an investigation and they came across the fact that some money had been used to buy a car for Mr Gillingham?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    You are right.    The chairperson of the hearing?    Yes.  Okay.    And who said all this must be done?  Whose idea was it?    To say we must have some paperwork that suggest that there was a hearing when they knew there was no hearing?    Oh okay so you too were part of it?    Yes but it was an arrangement that was made.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay, okay.  Thank you.    So are you able to remember around when in 2007 you signed the agreement?    You cannot remember the month?    Yes.    So the idea of this agreement between yourself and Mr Gillingham, whose idea was it?  Who came up with the idea that the two of you must conclude a loan agreement?    Yes.    Yes.    So, after Bosasa had paid this amount of R180 000 to Mr Gillingham through these transactions that you have told about which involved Mr Agrizzi, yourself, Mr Bonafacio, I am not sure if there is another one, after that this idea of this agreement came about or what did it precede the actual transaction?    Okay.  But the whole idea is your evidence that the whole idea of the agreement was simply to try and conceal the true nature of the transactions?    Namely that Bosasa had paid Mr Gillingham money to enable him to get the vehicle?    Thank you.    Is it not five?    Okay.    Okay.    Before the house, I am sorry, let me go back to the issue of the agreement between yourself and Mr Gillingham.  You mentioned that other people also were required to have agreements with Mr Gillingham.  You said Mr Agrizzi and Mr van Tonder, is that right?    Oh, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay, okay, thank you.    Did you take it from the dealership?    With the cooperation of the dealer?    Yes, but whoever you dealt with when you took the file they knew your intentions?    And that was to destroy the file?    How did you destroy it?    You burnt it?    Okay, thank you.    Do you know whether the SIU later on went to the dealer for the file and found that the file was no longer there?    And do you know what the dealership said happened to the file? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    You do not know?    Okay, thank you.    I am sorry, obviously there was something wrong that had been done in regard to this vehicle that is why you wanted to destroy the file, that is why you destroyed the file, is it not?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    I guess that is when they say files disappear.    Yes Ms Buthelezi?    How many such vehicles did you have?    Okay.    Yes.  Okay.    Do you remember more or less what the – well what was paid per person at any particular time?    And that is what year now?    Okay, thank you. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Huh-uh.    Okay.    Okay.  Thank you.    Hm.    And dry cement would be cement that you can buy at wherever?    Ja which is not ordered specifically.    Ja.    Okay.    Mr Wakeford?    Was, was Mr Wakeford building a house?  What was he needing the cement for?  Do you know?    And did, did you buy cement for him over a certain period of time or was it once or twice that he asked for?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay and do you have an idea as to what the monetary value would 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 have been of the total cement that Bosasa paid, bought for Mr Wakeford?    All in all?    Okay.    Ja.    What is it that helps you to remember that number?    That figure.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay, thank you.    That is in paragraph 31?    So that should be 2017, not 2013?    Okay.    Okay.    Oh.    So the 2013 in line three should be 2011?    And the other 2013 in the same paragraph should be 2017.  Is that right?    I am saying the first 2013 which is in line three becomes 2011.    Ja, the second 2013 becomes 2017? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Which one?    Should, should remain 2013?    Oh.    Okay, okay.    Alright.            Ms Buthelezi we are at five past four.    But we are left with very little so we should finish.    I think we are left with about two or three paragraphs or maybe four.    Or maybe six. [Laughing]    Okay, alright.    But we, I am sure we can finish, ja.    I am sorry Ms Buthelezi.  Mr Pretorius in case you have a commitment that you have to attend to you are excused.    Okay, alright.    Thank you. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    And who was they?    Yes.    You, you mentioned some, you mentioned a figure of 44 million.  Now I did not hear what you were talking about in relation to SARS and these affidavits.    Okay.    Yes. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Okay.    November 2015, hey?    Yes.    Yes.    When you say Angelo you mean Mr Agrizzi?    Ja. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I am, I am sorry.  You are talking about Brian now.    Is that somebody from Blakes Travel?    Yes.  That is what I.    Yes, okay.  What was his surname?    Oh, okay, okay yes.    Continue.    Get a what?    Vehicle, okay.    I am sorry.  Just say that again.    Oh, this was not the first time?    Okay.    Yes.    You were the first driver?    Yes.    That is Mr Le Roux?    So you had to say how it got bumped?    Hm.    Okay.    Ja.    By Mr Agrizzi?    What was the amount can you still remember?    Okay.    Okay.    Ja.    What did he say you did wrong?  Was it that you    You told Mr Agrizzi or what?    Okay.    Okay. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Did you say he fired you on the phone?    Ja.    Ja.    Okay let us go back to the hiring of this vehicle for Minister Nomvula Mokonyane’s daughter.  Ultimately Bosasa hired this vehicle for two months, December and January?    For her December 2016 and January 2016. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Ja.  From what you have said it was not the first time that Bosasa hired a vehicle for Minister Nomvula Mokonyane’s daughter, is that right?    Did it happen – did it happen once before, did it happen a number of times before?    Okay.    Was it always for the same daughter I do not know how many daughters the Minister has?    Oh for the same person?    Did you know on what kind of occasions she would require a hired car?  For example this was in November – was in December and January that is most 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 of that would be festive season but I do not know whether that might have been the reason and other occasions do you know what would have happened?    Now on the – you say there were two other previous occasions when you were involved?    On those two occasions did you get it hired in your name just as a ...(indistinct).    To the daughter?    Of the minister?    Okay thank you.    How – you delivered the motor vehicle to this now in December – December 2015.  Did you say you delivered to Minister Mokonyana’s residence?    Yes.  Now did you go to that residence only once or you were there a few times?    Yes.    Yes.    So you know two houses where she stayed now?    Okay thank you.    So are you saying that what you were informed was that you had to drop everything when Minister Mokonyane wanted something because she had influence with previous presidents including or previous President Mbeki and President Zuma, is that what you are saying?    That is what you were told?    And who told you that?    Okay thank you.    Okay.    Yes.     Thank you.    I am not seeing May 2016. Did you say May 2016?    Oh I am ahead of you.    Paragraph 33 Mr Vorster.    That is N-e-t-s-h-i-s-h-i-v-h-e.    Netshishivhe I think it is but my own pronunciation may be wrong.  Netshishivhe but I think I am probably close to it.    Oh so that is one of the few times when he signed?    And who Ms Netshishivhe?    So when you were approached by Mr Gumede with instruction that you must fix Ms Netshishivhe’s Isuzu bakkie Bosasa had not – did not have any contract in Mpumalanga relating to hospitals?    But later on Bosasa did get awarded such a contract or such contracts in Mpumalanga?    Okay.  Thank you.    Sorry I think I must just correct something.  I referred to Ms Netshishivhe but actually MS which I thought was Ms are the initials and it is a Mr.  Is that correct Mr Vorster?    It is Mr M S Netshishivhe.    Okay thank you.    Did you – you said Joe you mean Mr Joe Gumede?    Okay.    What elections were those?    Which year can you remember?    There were national elections in 2014 I think.    I think. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    In the Bosasa Group?    Okay.    How long – how long was the marquees there?    Okay. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    And do you know what it cost Bosasa?    You do not know.  Okay.    Okay.    Okay alright.  Thank you very much Mr Vorster.  I will release you but you probably will need to come back at some stage and I am sure there may be some assistance that the investigators might still ask of you but I take this opportunity to thank you for having come forward to assist the commission with your evidence.  Thank you very much.  You are released for now.      Thank you.  We are going to adjourn and resume at ten o’clock tomorrow.  We adjourn. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Morning, Chair.    Yes, if I may just add to what you have said, Chair, the issuing of notices to implicated parties has been continuing for over a week now.    Secondly a transcript of the application to you in respect of Mr Agrizzi′s evidence made on the first day on which he gave evidence is available to implicated parties who wish to have regard to the application, and its content.    Mr van Tonder you have your statement in front of you we were dealing with the evidence on page 6 of that statement and we had reached paragraph 32. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Do you recall a meeting which took place at the time the SIU investigation had just commence where there was a discussion of a pact?    Who was present at that meeting?    Alright.  Would you tell the, Chair, please of the content of that meeting?    Was any assurance ever given to you by Mr Gavin Watson?    Did he give any detail?    Okay.  Were you in Paris with Mr Agrizzi and 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Mr Gavin Watson when you first received the content of the SIU report?    After that were you given certain functions to perform and instructions from Gavin Watson?    What type of invoices?    What were you supposed to do with those documents?    How were these invoices or the expenses reflected on these invoices accounted for in the books of Bosasa?    So were these expenses reflected in the books as legitimate business expenses?    And was that the representation that would have been made to the South African Revenue Services?    In…[intervenes]    If we can move on then to the next part of your evidence please.  You speak in paragraph 34 and following of a vehicle being purchased.  Please tell the, Chair, about that purchase?    Do you know what position Patrick Gillingham held at the time?    Had you met him?    Did you receive an instruction?    Did you inform any other persons within the Bosasa group of companies of this instruction?    Did you comply with the instruction?    When Gavin Watson issued an instruction to you in the normal course, what was his expectation?    How did you carry out the instruction?    And what was this method?    Part of the Bosasa group of companies?    Related?    It had its offices at the Bosasa office park?    Carry on please.  The money now follows this route to Concilium Business Consultants.  Yes?    Alright.  That is quite a complex trail.    Money transfers.    Through various accounts, but the vehicle ultimately by whom was payment made?    Part of this series of transactions you have told the, Chair, was a loan agreement that you signed?    Let us then deal with the next issue that you raise and that is the SeaArk project.  Would you tell the, Chair, …[intervenes]    And did you have any knowledge yourself of why Mr Gillingham or his daughter were benefitting from Bosasa?  What was the purpose of this purchase?    May we then proceed to the SeaArk project and would you tell the, Chair, of the evidence you set out in your affidavit from paragraph 38.    Alright, we will see Mr van Tonder that this was quite an expensive operation.  Who funded it?    And what was the project all about?    Right, was there another company involved?    Alright, so consultants were employed, am I correct by Bosasa?  And the company through which Bosasa was working for the purpose of implementing the project, am I correct?    Alright.  The evidence as I understand it that you have given Mr van Tonder is that a 100% subsidiary of Bosasa Operations Pty Limited was established in order to administer the business?    And that company was SeaArk Africa Pty Limited?    The project was, however, funded you say by Bosasa Operations Pty Limited through various means?    And what role did Sustainable Resources International LLC play?    Alright.  So Bosasa in its function as funder of this project which was operated through its subsidiary SeaArk paid consultants R50-million over a period of time in order to facilitate the implementation of the project?    Alright.  We will get to the point of this evidence in a moment, but was the project successful?    Alright, let us just pause there if we may.  In your position as the Chief Financial Officer within the Bosasa group at the time, were you 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 involved in the finances of which you speak here?    So the financial transactions of which you speak here you had direct knowledge?    The fee of R50-million paid to consultants seems large.  It may be genuine I do not know, but was it a genuine transaction?    So this R50-million was paid to overseas entities?    Do you know whether value for money was received by Bosasa in relation to the consulting services you speak of?    Alright.  But let us go on.  You say the project for various reasons was unsuccessful, was the project then terminated?    In the books of SeaArk Africa was any outcome recorded on the termination of the project?    Is that the figure, the full correct figure in paragraph 43 of your affidavit?    Alright and how was that assessed loss derived?    The equipment that SeaArk intended using or used was that equipment purchased?    Yes, I am.    Yes, but it, it was indeed purchased and would have formed part of the losses at SeaArk I understand?    Now after termination of the SeaArk Project you will recall that the company SeaArk Africa (Pty) Ltd had been established for the express of operating this prawn plant, aquiculture plant.  What happened to its main business or how was its main business subsequently recorded or conducted? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Alright.  Let us just explain that a little.  Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd had at the time various kitchen or catering contracts?    Are those the contracts with the Department of Correctional Services?    Right and.    Alright.  So various kitchen or catering contracts with various Government entities?    Those contracts were held by Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd?    Were those contracts generating profits in the hands of Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd?    Now the loss that SeaArk had suffered in relation to the aquiculture project, how was that loss utilised for tax purposes?    So SeaArk Africa (Pty) Ltd changes its purpose.    It then purchases food items to sell on to Bosasa Operations.    [Intervenes].    And it marks those items up substantially.    And what is the result?    How did that occur?    So, but was it necessary to interpose SeaArk or Bosasa Supply Chain Management (Pty) Ltd in order for Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd to procure the goods?  Was this a necessary genuine business transaction?    Well the tax experts will no doubt look at the evidence and deal with it.  You are experienced in tax matters.  I presume?    What was the value of the benefit to Bosasa Operations of the introduction of this scheme?    Right.  In other words the assessed loss incurred by SeaArk in the aquiculture business was then used to offset profits in this arrangement of procuring food items for Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd.  Am I correct?    Okay.  Now was there an investigation?    What did they investigate in particular?    Right and were you involved in responding to the SARS investigators in relation to these matters?    In order to justify the use of the assessed loss and the write offs was it necessary to present evidence to SARS?    And what had to be done in these representations to the SARS investigators?  You deal with that in paragraph 47.    Just before you go on.  Was this a genuine operation?  30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Was it a commercially viable operation?  Are the prawns that we eat possibly from Krugersdorp?    Carry on please.    So the part of the investigative process and your response thereto was clearly a misrepresentation to SARS?    Right.    So I presume that the tax matters related to the evidence that you have just given.  The content of the investigation, the queries and responses are quite complicated.  We are not going to go into any detail now, but you say at least in part misrepresentations were made to SARS in the investigation?    Did SARS assess the loss that you have spoken of or part of the loss that you have spoken of as legitimate?    Was that a fair and lawful result?    What happened after the SARS investigation was then concluded as you say in favour of Bosasa?    You had told the SARS investigators that this was a genuine ongoing business operation? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    And after the conclusion of the investigation and after its outcome had been communicated you now receive an instruction to close the facility down?    Right.  Was this order or instruction to close the facility down and retrench all staff discussed amongst other persons within Bosasa?    What was the content of that discussion?    Right.  Did Gavin Watson learn of your view?    Alright.    And it was indeed closed down you say? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    The processing equipment was that later sold?    Alright.  You deal in the next paragraph with cash.    There has been evidence over the past two weeks of which you are no doubt aware Mr van Tonder of the need for and the manner in which Bosasa generated cash for the purposes amongst other things of bribing Government Officials.  You are aware of that?    In paragraph 52 and following you give details of the manner in which cash was generated.  Please tell the Chair of what you know in this 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 regard.    How was this cash generated?  Can you…?    You can tell the Chair in your own words.    Of what you record in this affidavit at paragraph 53 and following if you would.    Right.  Let us just stop there if we can.  Cash cheques would be issued by Bosasa or by Bosasa companies in the group?    The requisition for the cash cheque would be accompanied by an invoice for example for construction work?    To pay in cash to small business or other entities?    And were those invoices fake?    Right, carry on if you would.  You say that the amounts of cash became too large to utilise this cash generation facility or arrangement?    Well just please speak about the last four lines please in paragraph 53 before you go on.    So one of the methods used was that a fake invoice would be created in the name of a non-existed labour broker purportedly or on the face of it to pay employees in cash, their wages?    Right and we have heard evidence about the Metropolitan Scheme, but you say that documentation was also used as part of the cheque, cash cheque requisition process?    Were any other methods used?  You can go onto paragraph 54. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    And at paragraph 55 you talk of a share.    In Belfast.    Did it actually occur that Bosasa purchased the fuel for which it paid?    So in essence Bosasa would pay for fuel not received but receive cash in return?    And then in paragraph 56 you refer to another scheme.    So some of the invoices were fake invoices again.  No 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 goods were delivered against those invoices?    But Bosasa would nevertheless pay?    Then let us look at paragraph 57.  What do you say there?    Well as I understand your evidence here you received an instruction from Gavin Watson to obtain cash or attend to a delivery of cash?    The administration in the business would do the administrative work in relation to the receipt of cash.  You had not involvement in that?    But you actually collected cash you say?    Who actually gave you the cash which you collected?    Right and then in paragraph 58 you talk of another method of cash generation.    That is L-A-C-O-N-A-L-L-I-N [spelt].    Right.  What happened?    Were you responsible for the administration side?  How this would be recorded in the books and other things?    Right and what role did you play?    Let us go to 83.  It is on page 32 of Bundle T, is it T1?  Bundle T1, there are some email messages there.  What are they?  Not email, WhatsApp messages there.  Explain to the Chair please what we read here on page 32.    So was this a regular occurrence, this?    If you look at page 34 and the context of the request for orders because I think we need to explain how this request for orders actually worked in the scheme of generating cash.  Do you see page 34?    Almost halfway down the page against your name and 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    How much cash did one ton of chicken represent in cod?    If you could just take a moment to look at Annexure AT3 is there anything there that will confirm the evidence that you are giving?  I would not necessarily understand all the communications here.  So for example if you look at [intervenes].    No AT 3 – A T 3.    On page 32 yes I am sorry Chair.    If you go to page 36 for example.  Three quarters the way down the page there is a reference there against your name.  The exact quantity is 1.550 tons.  What does that mean?    Page 36.    Against the date 19 June 2017 10   Sorry that is on the 14 June at 15   So what we see here in Annexure AT3 is a series of communications between yourself and Gregg Lacon-Allan intended to arrange the – obtaining of cash from Mr Lacon-Allan?    Who would tell you what amount of cash was needed?    Would he also give you detail in relation to particular amounts and times and the remaining logistical issues regarding receipt of cash?    So who would collect the cash?    From whom?    And what did you do with the cash?    And what would you do at Bosasa Head Office with the cash?    Alright.  Let us go to paragraph 60 because there you describe at least in part how the obtaining of cash pursuant to your communications with Gregg Lacon-Allan was accounted for in the books.  First of all was this a genuine accounting in the books?    Is that correct?    Well tell the Chair please of the accounting arrangement or the recordal in the books that you describe in paragraph 60 please?    Of course you would have to pay?    Equal Trade or Gregg Lacon-Allan?    Who received that commission?    But the purpose of the commission I understand it was to pay for the trouble taken by Equal Trade or Gregg Lacon-Allan in providing the cash?    Yes and the orders to justify the payment to Equal Trade were those genuine orders?    Paragraph 61 you describe the scheme further.      So as I understand it a fake invoice would be created?    Later on.  But an order would be issued for the apparent purpose of providing food stuffs to various catering facilities conducted by Bosasa?    Alright were these genuine purchases?    Would the expenses reflected in that purchase be 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 represented to the Revenue Services as a genuine operational expense?    Yes carry on tell the Chair please of the arrangements you refer to in paragraph 61?    Would that then be followed by the invoice as you have said?    The items on the invoices were those recorded in a manner that could avoid SARS raising that queries?    Right then in paragraph 64 you make certain further observations regarding this cash generation arrangement.  Explain what you are saying here about the normal invoice payment dates and arrangements and whether these 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 arrangements of which you speaking differed from the normal arrangements?    Alright so in summary as part of this scheme at least you would receive a fake order.  You would pay for it and you would receive in return cash minus 12% commission.    And then there would be a scheme whereby fake invoices would be created to make the operation appear legitimate?    And you say as far as you know I presume you do not have direct knowledge but as far as you know the expenses reflected would actually be deducted from operational expenses for the purposes of tax returns?    Alright.    Okay thank you.    Is it a convenient Chair?    Thank you, Chair.  Mr van Tonder yesterday you gave evidence in regard to the video footage that had been shown here during the course of Mr Agrizzi′s evidence and you told the, Chair, that you had actually recorded the video, and you told him why you recorded the video.    Well you have already told the court.  I mean you have already told the, Chair.    Alright, so we do not have to repeat what you say in paragraph 65 on page 13?  But tell the, Chair, please about the system in relation to the handling of cash within the Bosasa offices that you talk about in paragraph 66 and following.    So this is the cash that you collected as detailed earlier in your evidence this morning?    Alright.  And then in relation to the management of the cash after you had put it in the vault?    Okay, we will deal perhaps with that issue again in a moment.  You say that you deposited the cash you received from various sources in the company secretary′s office vault in a safe there?    You were then instructed by Mr Watson to take cash to him in his vault, correct?    You will recall on the video there is at the beginning of the video a recordal of someone taking a cardboard box from a particular place in the Bosasa office park to Gavin Watson′s vault?  Do you recall that?    What does that video represent at that portion of the video?    Right and who is carrying the cash?    From where to where?    And when you arrived at the vault of Gavin Watson would you meet with anyone there? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Right, and on the particular video that you took who was present in Gavin Watson′s vault when you arrived?    Alright.  In Gavin Watson′s walk-in vault were there any other, were there any safes or how many safes were in that vault?    Well let us, you say three other safes.  How many safes in Gavin Watson′s walk-in vault?    Well when you say…[intervenes]    But there is a safe in the vault from which you have come, the company secretary′s safe?    And a drop safe what is that?    Yes, but what is a drop safe?    But not take it out again?    Alright.  The three safes in Gavin Watson′s walk-in vault do you know their purpose?    Alright, during the conversation that takes place on the soundtrack of the video that was played to the, Chair, mention is made of a person 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 called Patrick.  Do you know who that person is or was?    And do you know that from your own knowledge?    Well were you ever given instructions in relation to Patrick Gillingham?    Sorry, what were those instructions?    Megan.    Alright, did you carry out the instructions given?    Alright, to whom did you hand the cash?    And how was the cash packed?    Right, and where did you make this delivery or these deliveries?    You will recall that during the video and on the video soundtrack reference is made to an amount being R6 000 short, do you recall that?    If there was no record kept of amounts cash delivered how would anybody know that there was a short delivery of cash?    And to that extent…[intervenes]    I am sorry.    So somewhere, you say you were not always involved or you were not involved in the administrative processes, records would be kept which would then indicate whether there had been a short delivery of cash.  That would be notified and rectified?    Was the box sealed?  I am sorry to interrupt you.    So in summary Gavin Watson would order a specific amount of cash, correct?    He would have knowledge or access to knowledge of how much was paid to the third party by way of transfer, bank transfer?    And then he would then presumably be able to calculate how much money should have been in the box?    The order amount, invoice amount less 12%?    And you will recall on the video after you take the box there is a counting of cash and a discussion of R6 000 short?    The counting process about which the, Chair, had now asked you, is that the same process that occurred in the video? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Alright.  Approximately how much cash was collected by you during the period that you arranged cash deliveries from Equal Trade?    What was the purpose of this generation of cash?  For what was the cash used?    Any other purpose?    Alright, did you ever receive cash amounts?    In cash?    In fact as I recall the video footage that was shown to the, Chair, during the course of Mr Agrizzi′s evidence there is a clip or portion where Gavin Watson actually gives you money, is that correct?    Was that one of the cash payments for your purposes?    And that video was taken according to your statement and I presume that record is on your cell phone on 28 March 2017?    In paragraph 71 of your affidavit Mr van Tonder you record benefits received from Bosasa or Gavin Watson.  Would you detail these for the, Chair?    Did you know of a concern called Blakes Travel?    What role did it play, did Blakes Travel play in the affairs of Bosasa?    For whom?    Alright, who benefited from these travels or these travel arrangements?    Yes. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    So Blakes Travel would arrange travel and accommodation you say for people well placed within government?    Who would pay for the travel and accommodation?    Presumably then there would have been records in the possession of Blakes Travel evidencing these arrangements?    Did you know of that?    Were you ever given any instruction in relation to these records?    To destroy which documents?    Yes, before you go on, you mentioned VIP travels? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    That is a reference to whose travels?    Did you carry out the instruction?    Please tell the Chair what you did.    You do not deal with it here, but do you know whether Blakes Travel was ever compensated for the loss of its computers?    Okay.  The invoice books on your evidence at least related to the VIP account and dealings with Blake or dealings between Blakes Travel and Bosasa have now been destroyed.  Correct?    Was anything done to reinstate invoice books?    The different detail did this accurately reflect actual 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 travel that had taken place?    They were fictitious?    Let us move on then to paragraph 75.  You deal under this head with Messieurs Danny Mansell and Patrick Gillingham.  Tell the Chair please what happened in or about 2000.  Firstly is that the correct date?    What happened between?    And in 2003?    Alright.  We, as I understand it we do not need to go into any detail in relation to that transaction unless you wish to tell the Chair anything about 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 it.    But between 2000, the time of the disagreement and sale of shares and 2003 was Danny Mansell involved in his own business or farming operation?    And he had for all intents and purposes left Dyambu or Bosasa?    Alright.  Then in paragraph 77 you talk of an introduction to Patrick Gillingham.  How did that occur?    At that stage did you know of any work that Bosasa had done for any Government entity or in relation to any Government operation?    Right.  On 25 February 2005 did you have occasion to assist Patrick Gillingham in any regard?    Right.  Who paid for the flight?    Would you look at 84 please that is on page 38 of T1?  Your statement says that that document shows that Bosasa paid rental for the aircraft.  Is that correct?    38.    So this is, this shows you say that you did the flight, but it does not show who paid for it.  Is that correct?    Alright, alright.  I am not sure we need to go any, into detail in that regard.  You say the flight took place and Bosasa paid for it?    Let us go on then to paragraph 79.  Did you receive information from Gavin Watson at any stage in regard to Danny Mansell leaving the business?    What did he tell you?    Did you receive any instruction in this regard?    No, I also looked at that.    The word emigration and immigration.    Are used later on as well.    Yes.  Well it depends well you go from one need not be two. [Laughing]    Semantic, but the immigrated into the USA according to the statement or he emigrated from South Africa.    You say.  So I think we can, but.    [Intervenes].    Chair far be it for me to.    Argue the semantics, but he emigrated from South Africa.  Immigrated into the USA.  So perhaps we should put both words there.    Perhaps that is right.  Yes, Chair I give up.  I cannot recall whether I asked you did, who paid for the airline tickets?    For Mr Mansell and his family?    And your airline ticket?    Why would anyone want Mr Mansell to stay in America?    Alright.  Was this departure at the time of the SIU investigation?    Was there a concern as to whether Mr Mansell would be let out of the country?    Was anything done in relation to that concern that you know of?    Was that done to your knowledge?    Right.  What did you observe about Danny Mansell and his state of mind at the time of his departure?    How did you feel about the whole matter regarding 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Danny Mansell’s immigration?    [Intervenes].    Sorry before you go.    At page 39 of your bundle, T1.    It is an email addressed to Mr Agrizzi and Andries van Tonder.    I am sorry.  I interrupted you.    It is an email addressed to Mr Agrizzi copied or forwarded to you.    At a later stage.    When this email was sent had Mr Mansell already emigrated or was he still in South Africa?    You say in paragraph 82 in fact you left for America during January 2013.    Do you know whether Danny Mansell is receiving money or received money from Bosasa after he left South Africa?    The documents marked 86 at page 41 and following of Bundle T1.  What are those documents?    Right.  On the letterhead of a company or an entity called Safe As Fences?    Do you know whether any work was done by Mr Mansell or Safe As Fences in relation to the invoice of $7 000?    And would the books of Bosasa, would they reflect this as an expense/    So for example if you look at 86 on page 41 you will see under the head “Bill to Bosasa Operations” “Ship to Bosasa Operations”, underneath that an invoice number, a date, an amount of $7 000 and an activity consulting CCTV System Integration and a VAT number.  Did that happen?    And an accounting for this as an expense to the Revenue Services would this information be available as proof of the invoice?    A fictitious invoice or a fictitious series of invoices?    At page 41 of Bundle T1, page 42 and page 43 there are three invoices all in similar terms to the invoice on page 41 which you explained was a fictitious invoice.  No consulting CCTV System Integration Consulting was done.  The others are they also fake invoices?    Then you annex at page 44 a document addressed to you a Citizenship and Immigration Services and in essence the document reflects representations made to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services regarding the employment services or the employment status of Mr Mansell.  Do you see that?    Do you know anything about this documentation?    It talks about the functions of Mr Mansell as an    And it is signed on page 47 on the face of it by Angelo Agrizzi, but also by yourself?    Why was this document prepared?  Do you know and in that respect you can look at the amount reflected under terms of employment on page 47, $45 000 per year.  Why was this document prepared in 2017?    At this time was any extra payment made to Mr Mansell?  Do you know?    In paragraph 83 you refer to attorneys representing Patrick Gillingham during the SIU investigation.  Do you know whether during the SIU investigation Patrick Gillingham had been named?    Do you know from your own knowledge whether he received assistance from attorneys?    Do you know who paid the attorneys bills?    That is; thank you Chair.  87 appears on page 48 of Bundle T1.  What is this document?    48.    Right it is addressed to you?    And you knew what this invoice was for, correct?    How was Synchro Prop CC involved?    That is apparent from the document at page 51?    Where a tax invoice was issued to Synchro Prop per email and is that your email address andries@bosasa.com?    And you say these were fees that related to advise to Patrick Gillingham?    You speak of Synchro Prop its creation transfer and liquidation in paragraph 84.  Please tell the Chair briefly about that?    Who actually paid?    Funded by Synchro Prop?    Synchro Prop was ultimately liquidated?    Was the property previously owned by Synchro Prop transferred?    To whom or what entity?    Do you know whether Patrick Gillingham and Linda Mti ever had houses built for them?    Tell the Chair of what you were aware please?    What was your involvement?    Invoices to whom?    Right suppliers as well?    Right these expenses incurred by Bosasa in building these houses how were they reflected in the Bosasa accounts – books?    And what was SARS told?    Genuine operational expenses or capital expenditure expenses?    Alright and was SARS informed of the true situation?    Do you recall signing off any particular invoices in regard to the construction of the houses of Messrs Gillingham and Mti?     Any particular invoices?    Any other company?    You mention another company in paragraph 86.  Does that jog your memory?    Did you also sign off invoices for work done on houses of members of the Watson family?    Do you know how these expenses were accounted for in the books of Bosasa?    Right.  The next issue you deal with Mr Van Tonder is the fate of documents in Bosasa’s offices.  I presume that is the office park?    You say that you received a call on a Sunday morning?    Tell the Chair what happened please?    More or less when? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Before the report had been issued?    Okay please go on.    Do you know where Mr Agrizzi was at the time?    Alright.  So you receive the call, what do you do?    Did Mr Watson explain why suddenly this instruction came from him?    Please detail the instruction that Gavin Watson gave you and we are now at paragraph 91.    Did Gavin Watson in giving you this instruction express 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 any concerns?    You have described in your evidence now the documents as containing incriminating evidence can you provide a little more detail?  What documents were you to look for?    Right did you go and look for these documents?    Did Mr Agrizzi also go and look for documents?     Were these documents collected in one place after the search?    Are these other documents?    Do you know what these documents were?  Mr Agrizzi gave evidence in relation to files that appeared on the video that we have talked about this morning.    What happened then?  You say you collected documents, you gathered these documents together, you noted that Gavin Watson went through the documents in his walk-in vault, what happened then?    How big was this box?    And how do you know there was cash in the box?    What happened with these documents subsequently?    94.    Do you recall how long the documents remained there?    And after two years what happened?    Alright why did you do that?    Did you do that of your own accord?  In other words…    Did you burn all the documents that had been stored in this fashion and at this time?    Do you know anything about the relevance of this agreement?    Alright so having concluded your business at the metal drum at the Buffelspoort Dam what did you then do?    Did you see that?    What was Gavin Watson’s reaction on receipt of the document?    What did he do with the document?    Right and the next three paragraphs you deal with what you refer to as a holiday with Gavin Watson. Would you tell the Chair about that and also tell the Chair when more or less this holiday occurred?    Mr Agrizzi referred to a holiday that included a trip to Paris, is this the same holiday? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    And whilst you were in Paris did you receive any news concerning the SIU report?    And did you actually receive the report or a copy of the report?    Did Mr Watson say anything about the contents of the report in relation to him personally?    Right in paragraph 99 you give further detail to the Chair in relation to the receipt of the report and your response and the response of others to receipt of the report.  Please tell the Chair about that?    Was it your view and that of Mr Agrizzi and Mr Watson 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 you can tell the Chair the detail I do not want to lead you unnecessarily.  The information contained in the SIU report was there a view amongst yourselves that this must have come from within Bosasa Operations?    And your view?    Anyway you were instructed to try and find out where the information came from insofar as it was what you referred to as inside information?    A question that arises and I am not asking for your opinion but only for any direct knowledge.  Given your evidence and given the evidence of Mr Agrizzi and given the evidence we see on the video recording how would it come about that Mr Watson’s name was not mentioned in the report and I am asking for personal knowledge?    Alright before we move onto the next topic please go back to page 48.  Do you recall you gave evidence about the assistance given to Mr Gillingham and the payment of his legal bills?    And you refer to the document at page 48 and a document that followed on page 51, do you recall that?    From page 48 to 83 are all documents that appear on the face of it to be of a similar nature all involving Synchro Prop addressed to your email and all being legal bills from the firm of attorneys, are they all documents of the same character to which you have testified?    Okay.  The next document we are going to refer to is on page 84, Annexure AT8.  But let us go back to the text of your affidavit.  Paragraph 100 you talk of transfer funds into an attorney’s trust account.  Do you know of the fact that funds were transferred to an attorney’s trust account?    Were you told by Gavin Watson the purpose of the lodgement of funds in the attorney’s trust account?    What was – what were you told?    Alright would you go to page     Would you look at page 84 of Annexure T1.  This appears on the face of it to be an email from Angelo Agrizzi dated the 27 June 2016 addressed to Brian Biebuyck and addressed to yourself and copied to Carlos Bonifacio    Are you telling the Chair then quite simply that the attorney’s trust account held amounts in the region of R25 million for Bosasa?    And you were told by Mr Gavin Watson that this was the equivalent of a war chest to protect the funds?    Alright.  Chair is this a convenient time?    We can Chair.    The next witness is ready he will come after this witness.  I am happy to continue if the witness is happy and you are happy.    My forecast in days has been hopeless I do not think my forecast in minutes is any better but shall we continue for ten minutes Chair?    Were you ever present at the offices of any attorney when an agreement was drawn up we know as Frans Vorster and Patrick Gillingham?    What was the subject matter of this agreement?    Was it a genuine loan?    Who actually was burdened with that payment of 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 R180 000 in other words who paid ultimately?    R180 000 is given to Patrick Gillingham ostensibly as a loan, without going through the complexity of the loan transactions and how it was accounted for in the books of Bosasa, who actually bore the cost of the amount paid to Mr Gillingham?    Then…[intervenes]    Mr Agrizzi gave lengthy evidence concerning the events at the time of his departure and at the time of your departure from Bosasa.  During the course of that evidence your name came up frequently and as I understand it you were involved with Mr Agrizzi in various negotiations and at various meetings with the Watson family, is that correct?    Right, you do not go into much detail here, but Mr Agrizzi went into a great amount of detail supplemented by documents that he wished to present to the, Chair, towards the end of his evidence, correct?    We are going to ask, the legal team is going to ask you to cooperate with the investigators to look at Mr Agrizzi′s affidavit and to present to the, 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Chair, in affidavit form and personally to the extent necessary, the extent to which you agree with what he says in his testimony and the extent to which you disagree, and that would be done in due course, you can review his evidence in the course of the next few weeks.  You are happy to undertake that task?    In the meanwhile let us just tell the, Chair, what you say or of what you say in paragraphs 103 and following.  Do you recall that at a stage Mr Agrizzi issued a press statement regarding his intentions to give information to the public in relation to and to law enforcement agencies in relation to his activities and knowledge of what had occurred at Bosasa?    When that statement was released did you receive any communication any of the Watson brothers?    Alright, did you say anything to Mr Agrizzi about that call?    Alright, was it one call or did they continue?    You refer to a particular call in paragraph 104, what was 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 the content of that call?    Was anybody else a part of that call?    Subsequent to that call or those calls was a meeting held?    In relation to the requests made in those calls?    Tell the, Chair, about that meeting please?  Where it took place and who was present?    Alright, were these meetings of any long duration?    An undertaking to do what or not to do what?    Alright.  Did the discussions deal with any other topic in relation to what you say in paragraph 105?    What was that?    What do you mean by what to do?    More or less how much?    Alright.  The discussions did they continue over a period of time?    Were there discussions over terms and conditions, amounts, what had to be done by both parties?    In your view and you say you were present at these 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 meetings, in your view why did these negotiations continue if it was the intention simply to blow the whistle?    Alright.  In paragraph 107 you provide a little more detail of the subject matter of the negotiations.  Tell the, Chair, briefly about that please?    It may be put to you at some stage Mr van Tonder that the real reason for the breakdown and negotiations was that Mr Agrizzi was to satisfy to the extent that he would not really be in control of the business to the extent that, that might have formed part of the negotiations.  What do you say to that?    Yes.  At the time of these negotiations you say one of the topics under discussion was Gavin Watson stepping down and away from Bosasa and being replaced by Angelo Agrizzi.    Did the agreements accurately reflect that intention or 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 the draft agreements?    I will not deal with that then any further.  Was the agreement ever signed?    Right.  Tell the, Chair, please of what you say in paragraph 109?    And do you say that the Annexures at page 98 and following 80.9 are SMS messages which evidence these communications?    And the document at page 103, 80.10 of bundle T1, what is that document?    Yes, and it is apparent from page 111 that at least this document was not signed.    If you would just bear with me.  Chair, there is one matter that I would like to deal with in which my instructions are at this stage 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 incomplete, so perhaps…[intervenes]    I can look at paragraph 109 to see if anything needs to be dealt with further and to deal with the other matter and the next witness will follow after that.    Thank you. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    [Indistinct].    Apologies Chair.  Mr van Tonder would you look please at page 30 of your Bundle T1.    What is that document?  Just place it in context in relation to evidence you gave this morning please.    Right and you are talking of the SARS investigation into 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 the assessed loss and its application by Bosasa?    Yes and [intervenes].    No, we are not Chair.    Page 30.    Page 3-0.    Of T1.    I will get there and I will ask.    Okay.    3-0, Chair.    Okay.  You say that was a working document?    It is a working document where preparation was being made in order to respond to the queries of the SARS investigators? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    In relation to the application of the assessed loss of SeaArk?    Right and you told SARS according to your evidence that the components of the processing plant were distributed to various companies in Bosasa to show that the business continued in one form or another?    So for example in the middle of page 31 you will see a table.  It is not legible, but tell the Chair please what was represented here or page 30 rather?  What was represented here under the heading “Main Kitchen”?    In one of the Bosasa catering premises?    So was the intention to represent to SARS that the equipment had been distributed amongst various premises?    Was that true?    Then if we can go back please to page 21 of T1.  You talk of various WhatsApp messages between yourself and Jared Watson at the time of 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 departure and the departure of Angelo Agrizzi from, from Bosasa.    Did Jared Watson approach you on more than one occasion to meet with him?    Was a meeting eventually held?    And what was the aim of yourself and Mr Agrizzi?    How would you do that?    What would you have achieved if you had persuaded Gavin Watson actually to sign the document?    No further agreement was in fact reached I understand from your evidence and that of Mr Agrizzi?    Mr van Tonder subject to the need to put various 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 versions of those parties that successfully apply to cross-examine you to you and to obtain your response thereto and subject to you commenting positively or otherwise on the matters relating to you contained in the transcript of Mr Agrizzi’s evidence I understand that otherwise you are prepared to work with the investigators in their ongoing investigation?    And that would include the surrender of any electronic equipment or electronic devices where data is recorded?    Chair that for the moment then is the evidence.    No further questions for the moment.  Thank you Chair.    Chair the next witness is ready to give evidence.  He will be led by Ms Buthelezi.  I have been asked however to ask for an indulgence in order to collate certain matters in the file.  There is a new aspect of evidence that I think has to be checked and dealt with.  May we take 10 minutes?    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  I believe it has been postponed. 
MR ANDRIES JOHANNES VAN TONDER:  I understand that, Chair.    I recall it, yes, Chair.    It was Gavin Watson, Ronnie Watson and Valence Watson, Angelo Agrizzi and myself.    It was agreed that there was a pact formed and everybody should abide by the rules of this pact by – in terms of not speaking to anybody about the wrongdoings which we were implicated in in the SIU report.    Yes, Gavin Watson told us that he had everything under control.    He basically said he had access to the highest levels within the HAWKS and National Prosecuting Authority and therefore we need not to worry.    Yes, I was in Paris, Chair.    It included but was not limited to attending concerns raised by banks, auditors and I was told to be vigilant of any potential incriminating documents which, including invoices that I might come across.    Those invoices, the invoices that might incriminate the company.    I was supposed to bring it under the attention of Mr Gavin Watson and he would do with it whatever he felt fit.    Yes, it was invoices for example for houses that were built.    It was built for Mr Mti and Mr Gillingham.    As far as I can recall it was accounted in the books of Bosasa in the normal way as if it was expenses or capital expenses that was incurred by the company itself, because at the time there was a lot of renovations 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 that was done on certain of the buildings within the Bosasa group.    As far as I can recall, yes, Chair.    That would have been reflected as such to the Revenue Services, yes, Chair.    No, it was unlawful, Chair.    It was in December 2006 that Bosasa purchased a new Volkswagen Polo for a lady called Megan Gillingham the daughter of Patrick Gillingham.    I knew he had a senior position within the Department of Correctional Services.    I have met him, yes. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Yes, I received an instruction by Gavin Watson to facilitate the purchase of the vehicle for Megan Gillingham.    Yes, I informed Angelo Agrizzi and Dr Jurgen Smith about the instruction.    Yes, I complied, I immediately complied to the instruction.    Chair, his expectation was to leave everything as is and immediately attend to what he has instructed you to do.    I arranged through the accounts department to have a cash cheque made out in order to draw the cash and to deposit the cash into the Volkswagen dealership′s bank account.  The cheque required two signatories.  I signed the first signatory and I sent the cheque through to Dr Smith for a second signatory. Dr Smith then came into my office and told me that we cannot pay for the vehicle by means of cash deposit and he further, he continued saying that he did discuss this matter with Gavin Watson and he advised that Gavin Watson instructed him to do what he sees fit to – in order to pay for the vehicle and I was instructed that by a specific method of paying for the vehicle. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I signed a personal loan agreement with Dr Smith.  Then Dr Smith transferred the money from his personal bank account into my personal bank account.  I then transferred the money from my personal bank account to Volkswagen at The Glen in order to pay for the vehicle.  One to two months thereafter Bosasa transferred the money plus an amount to allow for tax and interest payable as per the loan agreement to Concilium Business Consultants.    It is not part of the Bosasa group of companies, but it was used by the Bosasa group yes.    Related, that is the right word.    That is correct, Chair, Concilium had its offices at Bosasa office business park.    From Concilium Business Consultants plus interest was transferred back into my sorry, sorry, I have skipped one section, Chair.    One to two months after the money was paid over to Volkswagen The Glen, Bosasa transferred the money plus an amount to allow for tax and interest payable to Concilium Business Consultants.  From Concilium Business Consultants the money plus interest was transferred into my private bank account.  To the best of my knowledge the tax was deducted and dealt with within 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Concilium Business Consultants, Chair, and then I transferred the amount plus the interest from my private bank account back to the bank account of Dr Smith.    Yes.    That is correct.    Bosasa did pay for the vehicle ultimately.    Chair, the vehicle was as far as I can recall was registered in the name of Megan Gillingham.  I was just a contact person to Volkswagen The Glen.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    Yes, the vehicle was registered in 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Megan Gillingham′s name as far as I can recall.    Yes, yes, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    Chair, at the time after the SIU investigation I handed the loan agreement to our legal team who assisted us or Bosasa in the SIU investigation.  I do not have it in my possession anymore nor do I have a copy.    Yes, I understood it, Chair.    The purpose was to get a mechanism for Bosasa to pay for a car for Patrick Gillingham′s daughter.    Yes, that is correct, Chair, the purpose was to create a mechanism to pay, that the money does not reflect directly as being paid as 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 from Bosasa.    That is correct, Chair.    As far as I, my understanding was to get a favour from Mr Gillingham who was high up within Correctional Services at the time.    During 2005/2006 Gavin Watson commenced with the process of building an aquaculture pilot project in the Coega IDZ in the Eastern Cape, Port Elizabeth called SeaArk.  A company SeaArk Pty Limited which was 100% subsidiary of Bosasa operations was established for that purpose.    Bosasa Operations or the Bosasa Group funded it, Chair.    The project entailed the breeding and growing of prawns, seawater prawns in a controlled environment.    There was an American company involved 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 called Sustainable Resources International through who the – which was – through which the American consultants were remunerated.    That is correct, Chair.    What I am saying, Chair, is if I can just explain Bosasa Operations is the holding company of all the other operational companies within the group and yes, Bosasa Operations made all the payments for the purpose of this project, but the funds that was generated was not necessarily generated by Bosasa Operations itself, the subsidiary companies had to contribute as well, but Bosasa Operations indeed made the payments.    Of the aquaculture business, that is correct, Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Mr Chair.    Sustainable Resources International to the best of my – the moneys, there were large sum of moneys transferred to Sustainable Resources up to the amount of approximately R50-million over the period of I would say three years and that was earmarked to pay consulting fees to various consultants to the project.    Yes, that is correct, Chair.    The project was not successful in the light that we could not continue with the commercial grow out of the project or build out of the project due to the lack of funding.  We could not get funding for this purpose and also there was some operational – other operational concerns which prevented this project to be continued.    I was very much involved in the application for funding in the project, Chair, if that is what you ask.    That is correct, Chair.    They would, if I understand your question correctly they would invoice on a monthly basis for this purpose and we had – Bosasa had consent from the bank to do these transfers to overseas company.    To the Sustainable Resources International which was an American based company as far as I know.    My opinion Bosasa did not receive value for money, Chair, on this matter.    Yes, the project was then terminated, Chair.    On the termination of the project there was 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 an assess loss reflected of R138-million in the books.    That is correct Chair.  That is R138 498 378.    This loss was derived from expenses on the project and also the equipment write offs relating to the project in the books of the company.    In paragraph; you are referring to paragraph 44 now Chair?    I refer here to a, a prawn processing plant not that the processing plant was used, would be used to process the prawns after they were harvested and this processing plant Chair was never used or unboxed at all.    Yes this, this equipment was written off in the company income tax, for income tax purposes Chair.    The main business was, of the company was changed to accommodate the utilisation of the assess loss for tax purposes in the, within the kitchen operations of Bosasa Operations.    That is correct Chair.    That that is correct Chair.  I am referring to that.    And, and it also had other, another kitchen which was, which was utilised to cook food for people in a youth centre and Lindela Repatriation Centre.    That is correct Chair.    That was held by Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd Chair.    Those contracts did generate profits yes, Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Well after the main business of the company was changed the name of SeaArk Africa, company SeaArk Africa was changed to Bosasa Supply Chain Management (Pty) Ltd and it acted as a procurement company for food items.  These food items then, was then sold on to the various kitchen operations at an average profit margin of 20 percent to Bosasa, well to Bosasa Operations which held the kitchen operations.  If I make sense.    Yes.    Operations.    That is correct Chair.    Approximately 20 percent if I can recall that Chair.    The result was that the assess was in Bosasa Supply Chain Management could be utilised for income tax purposes of the, the day to day businesses of Bosasa Operations which is, which was still continuing.    Base, well basically the food items were sold on from Bosasa Supply Chain Management to Bosasa Operations at, at a, at a 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 profit margin and that profit margin was then; so in Bosasa Supply Chain Management there was a profit reflected and that profit was off set against the reflected assess loss within Bosasa Supply Chain Management and that is how it was utilised Chair.    It was a general, it was a genuine business transaction on the procurement side, but the on selling of the food items to Bosasa Operations from Bosasa Supply Chain Management that that was, that was not that, because of the fact that the, there was a profit margin included for purposes of as I have explained now.  That was that was not right.    I have got limited experience in tax matters Chair.    The value of the benefit was approximately R38 700 000.    That is exactly correct Chair.    Yes.  SARS conducted an investigation on 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 this matter Mr Chair.    They investigated the utilisation of the assess loss and the existence of the assess loss within Bosasa Supply Chain Management and Bosasa Operations and also, they also investigated the equipment write offs in the books.    I was indeed involved Mr Chair.    That right, correct Chair.    Two things, we had to show two things.  The first thing is we had to show continuing; that the SeaArk Project continued and we, we did it by building a prawn production facility in Krugersdorp Gauteng and an entity for this purpose was created called Bio-Organics (Pty) Ltd and which was also a 100 percent subsidiary within, of Bosasa Operations. This project was funded by Bosasa Operations and artificial just for clarity sake, artificial seawater was manufactured to grow the plants in for this project and Gavin Watson even invited President Zuma to the facility in Krugersdorp and I was formally introduced to him at the facility.  So the first thing that had to be done for SARS purposes we had to show that the project continued and the second thing we had to do was.    It was a very successful operation, operation.  We, we, we, we bred beautiful prawns.    Then the second thing that had to be done was that we had to show that the processing plant equipment that was; that I have mentioned before that was never unboxed, we had to show that it was installed and being utilised in the, within the various kitchen operation of kitchen facilities in the group.  None of this equipment however was used in any of the facilities, kitchen facilities within the group and we, we, we had to show that it was installed into the kitchen at facilities and we have explained it as such even though it never happened.    That is correct Chair.    That was indeed the only time I witness, I was, I witnessed it yes Chair.    I was never present at any other of the 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 meetings.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.  SARS was convinced, we convinced, we managed to convince SARS of the above explanations and that the assess loss was indeed legitimate and they only disallowed a small portion of the processing plant write off Chair.    It, it was not a lawful result Chair.    Well a couple of months after the success we had in the SARS investigation Gavin Watson phoned me up and he instructed me to close down the Bio-Organics Project with immediate effect and retrench the staff.  He also, he continued to say and does it today still.  I, I pointed out to Gavin Watson the following day that closing down of the Bio-Organics Facility was in contradiction to what was reflected to SARS investigators.    That is correct Chair.  SARS also visited the prawn production facility in Krugersdorp.    That is correct Chair.    I did discuss it with Angelo Agrizzi.    I told Angelo Agrizzi that we cannot terminate the project and close down the facility, because of reasons explained and Angelo Agrizzi agreed with me.  That we cannot and it is unlawful to terminate the facility now, the production, the prawn production facility now, project.    Well when Gavin Watson got the impression that Angelo Agrizzi and myself were reluctant to close down the facility he instructed Carlos Bonifacio who was Head of the Accounts Department of Bosasa Operations at the time to attend to it and to make sure that the operation gets shut down.    And because of this I was completely side-lined and my opinion was ignored when we closed, when they closed down the Bio-Organics Facility.    That is correct Chair.  It was closed down.    Yes, the processing equipment was later sold.  That is correct.    I believed that it, it, it was indeed intended to, for the other purposes as was explained Chair.    Yes.  While I was interacting with SARS I believed it was just there as a smokescreen.    I am aware of it Chair.    Gavin Watson required a substantial amount of cash every month and it would vary from month to month and over the years it would, it, it would escalate, it escalated quite considerably as well.    Initially Chair.    Hm.    Initially Chair the cash was generated by means of drawing the cash from Bosasa’s bank account and how it was done was that we had to create fraudulent documentation to attach to a cheque requisition to request a cash cheque from the Accounts Department and it was motivated by we were contracting SMMEs who had no bank accounts and therefore had to be paid cash and the reason for the cash cheque.  The method of drawing the cash became problematic because the amounts that Gavin Watson required became too large.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    It was indeed fake Chair.    Yes that is correct Chair.  If I may go to paragraph 54?  There.    Okay.  The last few lines just addresses the, the, the nature of these fake documentation or invoices that were created.  It was non, for example non-existing labour brokers and again it could have been, it would have, it was motivated by a labour broker who had certain staff who and who did work for Bosasa and they required to be paid in cash.  As well as copies of Metropolitan Funeral pay-out documents were made and also attached as source documents for these cash requisitions Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.  In order to supplement the, the cash requirements.  Cash would be collected from a canteen in, at Lindela Repatriation Centre and also the canteens and bars at the various mine hostels which was run and operated by Bosasa.    [Intervenes].    Yes, a share in Belfast Hotel was required as it also had a business of a fuel pump station and a kiosk which generated cash.  Bosasa, it was Belfast Toyota who had invoiced Bosasa for the, for fuel sales for the cash taken and the cash would be transported to Bosasa Head Office on a daily basis.    That was the; that was the documentation reflected, but there was never fuel received from Belfast Toyota Chair.    That is correct Chair.  That is what happened.    From time to time we were instructed to utilise AA Wholesalers in order to collect additional cash.  Bosasa would invoice, would be invoiced by AA Wholesalers for goods that were not; that were not delivered amongst other genuine deliveries and transactions.  I mean.    Yes.  Some of them were fake invoices.    Pay and instead of receiving the goods receive the cash Chair.    Bosasa had an arrangement with a, with Riaan Hoeksma from Riekele Construction to arrange cash from a liquor wholesaler in Randfontein.  Riaan Hoeksma had a relationship with the, with the liquor wholesaler.  Gavin Watson would phone me up and tell me when he needed a cash delivery.  I would then advise Jacques van Zyl of the amount of cash that was required.  Jacques van Zyl and certain people in the Accounts Department would attend to the administration side of the, of the transaction of which I had no insight of into.  Once the cash was ready for collection I was notified by Riaan Hoeksma to collect the cash from his offices in Randfontein which I did.    That is correct Chair.    I had no involvement in the administration part Chair.    I, I collected the cash that is correct Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Riaan Hoeksma at Riekele Constructions Offices gave me the cash Chair.    This was the largest method of, of the no substantial method of getting cash and it was done through a company called Equal Trade which was run by a person by the name of Gregg Lacon-Allan.    That is correct Chair.   Initially, just on a background, Jacques van Zyl was responsible for the ordering and collecting the cash from Equal Trade.  Gavin Watson then instructed that this function be handed over to me on about, if I can recall right, July 2016.    No.  I was not responsible for the administration side Chair.    Gregg Lacon-Allan would send me a message via, via WhatsApp on a Monday morning requesting order requirements for the week and I have attached a copy of these WhatsApp messages as an annexure to my affidavit. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Page 32.  This is a WhatsApp message received from Gregg Lacon-Allan. “Hi Andries, I am just checking if you have any orders for this week, regards.” And I would reply. “Hello Gregg, I have not seen Gavin yet, but will find out and let you know.” And then he would follow up on it.  Gavin or Allan, Gregg Lacon-Allan would follow up    Sorry, should I tell you, Chair, why I recorded the video?    I remember telling the, Chair.    After I collected the cash I would take it to 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Bosasa Head Office and I would lock it in a safe which is situated in a walk-in vault in the company′s secretary′s office.  The reason for that is Gavin Watson was not available, normally not available to receive the cash when I arrive with the cash at the offices.    That is correct, Chair.    Gavin Watson would phone me and he would when he needed the cash and he would instruct me to bring it from the company – where it was locked now in the company secretary′s fault brig it or take it to his personal vault which is…[intervenes]    Yes, I would just take everything I had.    Yes?    No, Chair, there was no recording done by myself in that safe of the company secretary, no. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Or by anybody.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    Yes.    If I understand your question right that is, in that box is cash.    Myself.    I would carry the cash from the company secretary′s vault to the vault of Gavin Watson.    Yes, Gavin Watson was there and there were other people also present in his vault.    If I can recall right it was myself, Gavin Watson, Johannes Gumede and Papa Leshabane.    There were three other safes in his vault of which one is a drop safe, Chair.    A drop safe.    There are three other safes in Mr Gavin Watson′s walk-in vault.    No, no it is only three.    Yes that is in a different vault.  There is a 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 safe that is in the company secretary′s vault where the money was locked.    Yes.    That is correct.    Actually, Chair, there are two smaller safes in the company secretary′s vault, but only the one was used for my purposes of storing the cash.    That is one of the safes in Gavin Watson′s vault.    It is a safe that has got a small entrance where one, just big enough to drop cash into the safe.    You cannot take it out.    The purpose of that was to store the cash until such time as he required the cash, Chair.    Yes, Chair, it is Patrick Gillingham.    I know it from my own knowledge, Chair.    Yes, Chair, I was.    I was instructed to take him a delivery of cash.    That is correct, Chair.    Yes, I delivered his – Patrick Gillingham′s cash for him.    I hand it to Patrick Gillingham himself, Chair.    It was packed in a grey plastic security bag, Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I made the delivery at a shopping centre close to Lanseria airport, Chair.    I recall it, Chair.    When Gavin Watson takes delivery, took delivery from the cash from me the box would be opened and the cash would be counted and it was a basic reconciliation to make sure that the amount of cash that was received is indeed the amount that should have been delivered according to the payment that was made less the 12% commission.    And…[intervenes]    I am sorry, Chair, and the previous delivery there was a R6 000 short delivery on the previous delivery and that was one of the – that was the R6 000 that was discussed in the safe, Chair.    Yes, the short delivery of cash was just 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 between myself and Gavin Watson.  Again Gavin Watson would look at the – I would have a proof of payment which we always made and where I have deducted the 12% commission which got to the net amount of cash that would have been received.  That amount – that paper was also seen by Angelo Agrizzi that specific proof of payment.  I told him about that and then basically Gavin Watson will look at the amount, the net amount and made sure that the actual amount of cash that was received corresponded to the net amount that should have been received. And should there be a shortfall like in this case the R6 000 it had to be recovered on a later stage from Equal Trade.    It is a shopping centre close to Lanseria.    Yes.    I knew then, correct, Chair.    Because I would arrange or ask for Jacques van Zyl to arrange for the payment to be made for a specific amount as requested by Gavin Watson.    Absolutely. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    You are 100% right.    My knowledge would be based on paperwork, yes, Chair, that is right.    That is correct, Chair, it would only be the net amount.    That is correct, Chair.    Correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair, no recording at that stage, because I never opened the box without Gavin Watson being present.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    That is right, I would just take the entire box.    Absolutely.    Yes, it would be in a brown carton box normally.    Sealed.    Yes, I guess it will show if I interfered, yes.    Correct, Chair.    No, I would do it when he was there.  He 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 would call me to his safe.    I would only take it to his safe on his instruction and he would meet me there normally, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    I would take the bank transfer with me to the safe.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    That is the same process, Chair.    It was approximately between 4 and R6-million a month, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    It was used for bribery, Chair.    And some of the staff that was involved in the process of arranging for the cash, the administrative process would receive an amount of cash every month as a bonus if you want to call it like that, but it was not limited only to people that were involved in arranging the cash in terms of staff.  Other staff members who was not involved in the process also received cash amounts every month.    I received R20 000 per month, Chair.    In cash.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    It was paid to me in cash, yes.    Gavin Watson himself, Chair.    No, Chair, I did not receive the additional R20 000 a month when I left Bosasa.    No, I received it over a period of – it started if I can recall right it started in 2005.  The amount was not always R20 000 a month, Chair.    It increased over the years.    This type of payment to me ended when I left Bosasa in the month of November 2017.  I did not receive any cash payment.    That is correct, Chair.    If I can recall right, yes, Chair.    More or less, yes.    I recall it was about R5 000, Chair, when I started.    Increased progressively over the years.    Chair, more or less I would say in 13/2014.    Yes, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    I left Bosasa November 2017.    Sorry, Chair.    So the last payment I received was in 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 October, should have been in October 2017.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    I recall mainly, mainly from Gavin Watson if he was around, but if he was not present at the office at the time I recall his daughter Lindsey Watson would bring me the cash.    Yes.    It was mainly paid overseas holidays, tyres to be fitted to my car and also maintenance on my house.    My understanding was that it was extra cash given to me to keep quiet, because Gavin, Chair, if I may, Gavin Watson used to say to me remember you are also compromised now.    Not really, no, Chair, no, no, but I recall Gavin Watson would also say to me that all the people that he pays, remember they are all compromised now.  So – and his understanding is that they would keep quiet, because they would get into trouble should they talk out.    Yes, I do, Chair.    It was the travel agent that Bosasa used to book travels and accommodation.    For its business dealings.    It was if you say benefited do you mean people outside of the business of Bosasa, Chair?    It would be people within the South African government and important people as this – that deals with some of the people who benefited.    That is correct, Chair.    Bosasa would pay for the travel and accommodation, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    I am aware of it, Chair.    Yes, I was instructed by Gavin Watson to destroy the related documents.    It was documents which we have collected.  Angelo Agrizzi and myself drove – we were instructed by Gavin Watson to drive to Blakes Travel and to collect all incriminating documents in terms of these special VIP travels and it would – we collected that with some computers and we were instructed to go and destroy that which we collected.    Yes.    Those were travels relating to members of South African government and other important people as this was at the time of the SIU investigation and in the SIU investigation if I can recall right there was some – the travels was addressed of outside – of these VIP′s outside of Bosasa and therefore we had to collect it to destroy the evidence.    That is exactly right Chair.    Chair I do not know what ranks it was.  I did not really.    No.    That is.    Yes Chair.    That is all I knew Chair.    Yes, I did Chair.    We took the, the invoice books and the computers collected at Blakes Travel and we drove with it, we took it to a place called Luipaardsvlei.  It is an old mine hostel complex which is just across the road of Bosasa Head Office.  There was a hole dug with a TLB Tractor and the collected stuff was thrown in this hole, fuel was poured over it, set alight and after a while it was covered by, with soil again.  The hole was covered by soil again and a big concrete block was placed on top of it.    As far as I can, my knowledge is that Bosasa bought new computer for Blakes Travel.    That is correct.    Well the invoices which were on record was, at Bosasa was replaced by invoices also from Blakes Travel, but with different detail written on it.    No, it did not Chair.    It was fictitious Chair.    That is correct Chair.    It was approximately the year 2000.    Approximately 2000 Danny Mansell which was the Managing Director of Dyambu Operations at the time had a disagreement with Gavin Watson and as a result Gavin Watson purchased the shares, Danny Mansell’s shares in Dyambu Operations.    In 2003 Danny Mansell returned to the company as a consultant as he sold his cattle farm in the Eastern Cape.  His services were required in, in, in a potential business deal with Rand Water Board which involved cattle.    No.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Well on a few occasions I have noticed that certain officials from the Department of Correctional Services visited our offices and they were dressed in full uniform.  I was introduced to Patrick Gillingham on one of these visits by, Danny Mansell introduced me to Patrick Gillingham on one of these visits.  That is how I met with him.    I, Bosasa had start, commenced with excessive, extensive upgrades on the kitchen at the Lindela and Youth Centre Facility in Krugersdorp and I was told by Danny Mansell it is to prepare for a, for, for a, for a tender regarding Correctional Services, a Kitchen Tender.    Yes.  On that date Danny Mansell arranged 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 that I fly Patrick Gillingham in a private aircraft to Mafikeng and back the next day, 26 February.  Patrick Gillingham just told me he, the reason for the visit is he, he had to meet people in Mafikeng.  That was the only reason he gave.    Bosasa paid for the flight.    [Intervenes].    Oh at 38 sorry.  My apologies.  This annexure Chair is merely a copy of my flight log book just to as, as proof that I did the flight.    That is correct.    That is exactly what it was.    Yes, I did Chair.   Gavin Watson informed me that 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Danny Mansell is immigrating with his family to America.   I received an instruction from Gavin Watson to accompany Danny Mansell to the United States in order to make sure that he does not turn back.    I am sorry.    Emigration, yes.    Yes.  He emigrated.    Yes.  My apologies.    Bosasa paid for the airline tickets Chair.    That is correct Chair.    As well Chair.  They paid for my airline ticket as well Chair.    The purpose was to make sure he does not turn back.  He must go to America and he must stay there.    Because Mr Mansell had, he was very much involved with unlawful dealings in the past regarding the business of the company 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 and specifically Correctional Services.    No.  I was just told to make sure he does not turn around.  I would just have to get him there. [Laughing]    That was the instruction.    Or to make sure that he actually went to the USA and nowhere else.    That is correct Chair.    There was indeed a concern that Danny Mansell’s passport might have been blocked at customs and at, at O R Tambo International Airport because of the pending SIU or ongoing SIU investigation.    Yes.  Director Papa Leshabane, he is a Company Director of, within Bosasa made sure via his, a contact within the Department of Home Affairs that customs control would not block us. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I do not know whether he was, whether it was blocked or not, but we managed to pass through customs with no problem.    I recall that Danny Mansell was extremely stressed out when I met him at the airport and I asked Danny Mansell how he was feeling and he actually had tears in his eyes and he said, he replied that it felt like it was very unreal to him.  That he is actually now moving to America and, and he was saying to me that his mind does not really want to accept the fact that he is now moving from South Africa to America.    Not that I am aware of Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I do not know Chair.    I do not know.    I actually felt sorry for Mr Mansell, because of his state that he was in and may I Chair refer to an email which he, he, of his to    “Met Gavin Watson.”    I am sorry.    That is correct Chair.    Yes, yes Chair.    May I just quote a sentence, a paragraph?    That is right Chair.    And then also if I may Chair in the, in the    To the best of my knowledge it was, he was still in South Africa Chair.    That is as best as I can remember it.  Yes Chair.    Yes.  Danny Mansell received an amount of US$7 000 per month from Bosasa since he left Bosasa and when I, until such, well when I left Bosasa he was still earning it.  The payment was made every month to Mansell. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Those are copies of invoices he would send to Bosasa on a monthly basis for the payment of his US$7 000.    That is correct Chair.    No work was doen Chair.    It would be reflected as an expense.  Yes, Chair.    It never happened Chair.  He did not, he never consulted during that time to Bosasa.    Yes, Chair.    Yes.  These invoices should reflect still on 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 the books of Bosasa.    Yes, Chair.  Mr Mansell would, the plan was for Mr Mansell to, to, to apply for American citizenship.  That is correct Chair.    We.    When we arrived in America, Chair?    Chair as far as I can recall at the time I was also had, busy researching technology of prawn farming and we visited a prawn farm in Indianapolis and I recall him, he, he went with me to that prawn farm.    Yes, we stayed, we stayed in a hotel for, for a period of time.  I do not recall exactly where we parted ways in America, but yes we did.    Yes, I would come, I returned on my own Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I would.    Chair I would, it was about five days I would say.    All of them are fake invoices Chair.    Yes, I see it Chair.    Yes.  It is a document that Danny Mansell requested Bosasa to do for him to assist in acquiring citizenship in the USA.    No, it is not Chair.    He had no involvement with Bosasa.    In the USA in terms of business.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    The purpose of this document was to assist Mansell to get permanent citizenship in America.  That was the purpose of this document Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I cannot recall of any additional payments other than the $7 000 per month Chair.    Yes, it was paid every month Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes, Chair.  Patrick Gillingham was named in the SIU investigation.    I know that yes Chair.    Bosasa paid the attorneys bills through another company. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I do not know whether he, I do not know whether he was happy, not happy or not.    But I mean for a person to have, to be tearful he must have been not happy.    Which page Chair?    I was present, yes, Chair.    This was relating to a vehicle that was – this was – in this agreement Frans Vorster advanced R180 000 to Patrick Gillingham to enable Gillingham to purchase a Mercedes Benz vehicle and this agreement was done as a loan.    No, it was not a genuine loan.    Just repeat the question please, Chair?    Bosasa carried the cost of it eventually.    Chair, one of the next witnesses will have detail on this.    That is correct, Chair.    Correct.    I am happy to undertake that task, Mr Chair.    Yes, I recall, Chair.    I received a telephone call from Valence Watson the brother of Gavin Watson asking me to assist in persuading Angelo Agrizzi not to go ahead and not to whistle-blow.    I informed Angelo Agrizzi about that call, yes, Chair.    No, Chair, the calls from Valence Watson continued over time, a period of time.    It was a call quite late at night made by Valence Watson to myself and where I had a very long discussion with Valence Watson again trying to assist them to persuade Angelo Agrizzi not to whistle-blow.    Yes, Chair, he handed the phone to Mr Gavin Watson who also asked me to assist in this regard.  Even Valence′s wife spoke to me on the phone.  They handed the phone to her as well.  It was a very long discussion and yes.    Correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    Yes, it was on request of the Watsons.  We had a meeting held at Angelo Agrizzi′s house, attended by Angelo Agrizzi, myself, Brian Biebuyck, brothers of Gavin Watson which Ronnie Watson and Valence Watson and also Jared Watson who is the nephew of Gavin Watson.    Yes, these meetings were long and carried    An undertaking not to whistle-blow.    Yes, it did, Chair.    Chair, the Watsons wanted to know from Angelo Agrizzi what to do in order for him to stop whistle blowing not to go ahead with his whistle blowing.    They were prepared to do anything to stop him and in this case there was an amount, an amount of money structured which was offered to him in that regard.  It was in the process of being discussed during these meetings.    It was more or less R50-million, Chair.    Yes, Chair, the discussions did continue over a period of time.    There was a proposed agreement that was sent to Angelo Agrizzi for him to review.    The reason why these negotiations continued was we wanted to show or Angelo wanted to show that Gavin Watson has got this war chest that he have unlimited funds that he can use to stop people doing in this case to stop Angelo Agrizzi from whistle blowing and that was the purpose it carried on.  We wanted to show that Gavin Watson was prepared to bribe his way out of or pay his way out of any difficult situation.    Well as I mentioned the offer that was discussed was in the region of R50-million which included money and/or a potential buy-out of a business with certain conditions such as Gavin Watson would step down as CEO, Angelo Agrizzi replacing him and then as I mentioned a proposed unsigned draft agreement was emailed to Angelo Agrizzi thereafter.    Is this in this regard, Chair?    Yes.    I cannot recall, Chair, I did not pay much attention to it.    The agreement was never signed, Chair.    Well following those meetings I just referred to now there were various WhatsApp messages which I have attached to my affidavit between myself and Jared Watson in this regard.  Angelo refused to take further calls from the Watsons.  He refused.  Jarod Watson begged me on numerous occasions to meet with him for me to mediate on this – in this matter.    That is correct, Chair.    That is a copy of the agreement which was forwarded to Angelo Agrizzi as a proposed agreement.    Yes, that is correct, Chair.    I am there Chair.    That was a sheet we prepared in preparation for the SARS investigation to show where the processing plant equipment of the, the prawn processing plant equipment was sent to for, for, for use in the various kitchen facilities of the Bosasa Operations, but this was just a working document in preparation for our submission to SARS.    That is what I refer to Chair.    It was a working document, right Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Ja and also with specific reference to the, to the processing plant.    That is correct Chair.    That is, we indicated certain of the processing or specified certain of the processing plant equipment which was transferred to main kitchen.    That is correct Chair.    That is exactly what was presented to SARS, yes Chair.    It was not true Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes, Chair.  He did.    There was a meeting held, yes Chair.    The aim was for, to get Gavin Watson to sign the agreement.    By persuading Jared Watson to persuade his uncle to, to, to sign it.  We basically, I took along some working notes which Angelo Agrizzi prepared and I took it along for discussion and that is what we have used.    We could have shown that Gavin Watson has got unlimited funds that he always used to buy himself out of difficult situations and by him, if we had an agreement that Gavin Watson signed we could have shown that he tried to buy himself out of this situation as well.    That is correct Chair.    I will give my full support to the investigators Chair.    That is that is that is true.    No, Chair.    I did not.    Yes that is correct Chair.    No, Mr Agrizzi left a year prior to that.    That is correct Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I would say about 12 years Chair.    Thank you for the opportunity to be here. 
ANDRIES JOHANNES VAN TONDER:  It was a weekly occurrence Chair.    I see it Chair.    No.  There was never chicken deliveries and it – and it was merely a code name for the cash to be delivered and…    One ton of chicken would represent R1 million.    That was – that is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Sorry Chair I just want to get to the – to the 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 right place.  What date is that the 14th?    Yes.    That is correct.  1.550 tons reflects R1 550 000,00.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Gavin Watson would tell me Chair.    Gavin Watson would just tell me how much cash he would require.    I did collect the cash.    It was delivered at a filling station or at a shopping centre close to Lanseria Airport.  I collected the cash. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I – then I would take the cash back to Bosasa Head Office.    I would lock the cash in a safe which is situated in a walk-in vault in the company secretary’s office.    It was accounted in the books as food consumption.    But it was not correct.  It was fraudulent.    Basically Jacques Van Zyl – I would notify Jacques Van Zyl about the requirement of cash.  He would then make the necessary arrangements in the accounts department.  He would arrange for the payment first thing to be done and…    Yes.    Yes and this payment included a 12% 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 commission.    I cannot – as far as I know it was Gregg Lacon-Allan.    That was the purpose of the 12% Chair.    No it was not genuine orders Chair.    So the order sheet was prepared by – in our accounts office and then the – this order sheet – the purpose of this order sheet was to allocate this amount to the various kitchen units for Gregg Lacon-Allan’s business to enable them to invoice Bosasa.  So it was a big amount so this amount had to broken down to the various kitchen units and that was the purpose of this order sheet that was created.    Later on yes.    We refer to it as an order sheet yes Chair.    No it was not genuine purchases Chair.    To the best of my knowledge it was reflected as an expense in the books of Bosasa.    Then what the order sheet was now created and it would be sent – I would send it off the – to Equal Trade.  From a separate gmail address called johnforest@gmail.com that is the email address that was used.  This email address if I may was created not by me I inherited this email address johnforest but this is where through which the communications were done to – to Equal Trade in this regard.  So the proof of payment together with this order sheet would now be mailed to Gregg Lacon-Allan’s Equal Trade and we would arrange for a delivery – cash delivery at – the cash delivery one or two days later.    Yes.  What would happen then is about a week later Equal Trade would send Bosasa the invoices which was generated based on the order sheets which were – the order sheet which was sent to them.  And it was for items that Bosasa never received.    Indeed so Chair.  It was all non-VAT items.    Yes.  Payments for this purpose was always done prior to invoicing and this is in contrary with the normal day to day operations of other suppliers to the group.  They would only get paid 60 days after statement and this was – which was completely different to the day to day normal operations.  And the items and the invoices were not followed through the normal channels.  The unit leaders at the various operational sites and the storemen and they have never seen these invoices and they have not stamped those invoices.    That is indeed how it happened Chair.    That is hundred percent correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    No these payments were always done before the invoices was generated Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    This is correspondence from Attorney – from the attorneys in respect of payments required for legal services rendered to Mr Patrick Gillingham.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Synchro Prop CC paid for the – for these legal fees.  The attorney’s firm invoiced Synchro Prop for payment.    That is correct Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Synchro Prop belonged to Gavin Watson and it had a property – it owned a property situated in Ruimsig and Synchro Prop was then donated by Gavin Watson to myself and Angelo Agrizzi as an incentive.  And the – we used this closed corporation to facilitate the payments of attorney’s legal – legal fees to attorney on – for Patrick Gillingham so that it is not apparent that it is directly paid from Bosasa Chair.    Synchro – it was paid out of Synchro Prop bank account.    Funded by Bosasa.    Yes.    As an incentive to in my opinion and what I could gather from this donation was to keep us loyal to himself and to do whatever he 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 tells us to do.  That is how I interrupted it Chair.    We got the property as a benefit Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That was – that is correct Chair.    It was transferred to another entity called Spilacraft CC which belongs to Angelo Agrizzi and myself.    Yes I was – I am – I was aware of it Chair.    I was aware that Bosasa paid for houses built for Patrick Gillingham and Linda Mti.  Danny Mansell handled the arrangements for payments on these houses.    My involvement was basically to sign off on invoices where applicable.    Invoices to contractors who was involved 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 building the houses.    Yes where applicable yes, yes Chair.    It was reflected as construction work done in the books of Bosasa.  Because as I have explained previously Chair at the time there was a lot of building operations that went on within Bosasa and it was just absorbed in that.  To the best of my knowledge that is how it was absorbed.  It was never shown separately or anything or anything.    Well it was reflected to SARS obviously as expenses in the books of Bosasa.    Well it would have been – it would have been both capital and operational Chair where applicable.    SARS was not informed of the true situation Chair.    I recall signing off invoices yes Chair.    To a company called Riekele Construction. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    That is the only one I can recall Chair.    Oh yes, yes.  It was a company called Grande Four Ranches which was owned by Danny Mansell and which – through which payments were also done to – for purposes of these houses being built.    Yes I did Chair.    No Chair at that time I was really side lined.  I did not have any access into the books of Bosasa operations and therefore I do not – I cannot tell you first – from first-hand knowledge on how it was accounted for in the books.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I received a call from Gavin Watson early on a Sunday morning.  I cannot recall the date.    It was at the time of the SIU investigation Chair.    Yes Chair.    I received a call to meet him at the Bosasa offices and he also called Angelo Agrizzi to meet him at the offices.     He was at the Madikwe Game Reserve at the time Chair.    I left everything like always and I drove to Gavin Watson – to meet Gavin at the offices – Bosasa offices where he mentioned to me that we have to clean up all possible evidence that might incriminate himself and Bosasa in terms of unlawful activities.    He said he had – he received information that the Bosasa offices would be raided the next day.    Well Gavin Watson instructed myself and Angelo Agrizzi to go through all the safes, employee’s drawers, etcetera to ensure that any possible sources of incriminating evidence would be removed and destroyed.    Gavin Watson was concerned.  He kept on saying we cannot leave these premises until we are hundred percent sure and certain that all possible incriminating documents were removed and yes that was his concern.    It was documents related to all tenders, government tenders and businesses that he had – and business that he had – business dealings he had with government entities.  Detail would be possible incriminating invoices such as the travel invoices as I have explained to you before Chair.  It would be work done on houses built and – but it – I recall it was the documents that we removed were mainly tender related documents Chair.    I was there myself yes Chair.    Yes myself, Gavin Watson, Angelo Agrizzi went through and search for possible incriminating documents.    Yes.  Gavin – I just – if I may Chair I just want to add something.  Gavin Watson went – personally went through all the documents in his own walk-in vault.    Yes they are yes, yes.  The documents that Mr 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Watson stored personally himself.    It was tender related documents and I recall there were quite a few computer CD storage discs, CD discs.  I do not know what was stored on these discs or the content.  I never dealt with it myself.    Well we met Gavin Watson at his house and that is where I recall Gavin Watson giving a lady called Ms Lindie Gouws a metal tin box with some cash in it for safekeeping?    It was about 50 centimetres long and I recall it was about 10 centimetres high.  So it was – no it was longer.  It was – it was about 60 centimetres long and it was about 10 centimetres deep.    I saw it Chair.    Which paragraph are you now Chair?    94.  These documents were taken to a farm near Mooinooi in the North West Province and it was stored there in safes in a small outside building.  These safes were installed by Bosasa. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    The documents were kept there for approximately two years Chair.    After two years myself and Angelo Agrizzi collected these documents and CD discs and took it to Buffelspoort Dam where it – where we burned the content in the – in the – in a metal drum.    To destroy evidence.    It was under the instruction of Gavin Watson – from Gavin Watson to go and destroy the documents Chair.    No there was one document that we did not burn Chair.    I did not understand the relevance of this agreement but Angelo Agrizzi told me that Gavin Watson was looking for this agreement and it was basically an agreement – he told me it was an agreement between Gavin Watson and Linda Mti.    We drove back from Buffelspoort Dam to Gavin 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Watson’s house and Angelo Agrizzi gave this document that Gavin Watson was looking for – he handed him that document.    I saw it yes Chair.    He was very relieved.    He tore up this document in our presence and he flushed it down the toilet.  He even had it in a plastic bag of – if I recall right plastic bag of water before he flushed it down the toilet.    This holiday was during the time of the SIU investigation just before the SIU report was issued.  Angelo Agrizzi and myself started raising our concerns well that was at the time of the SIU investigation about the way things were done at Bosasa in order to get various contracts from the South African government.  I refer – referring to bribery.  Myself and Angelo Agrizzi believed that Bosasa Services Delivery was good enough to get new business on merit.  While Gavin Watson believed that Bosasa had a – had to bribe people to get new businesses and that was the difference in opinion we had.  Gavin Watson then took Angelo Agrizzi and myself on a holiday to Italy and France.    That is the same holiday Chair.    Yes Chair I did receive – we did receive news.    We did receive a copy of the report in Paris, yes Chair.    I can just recall that Gavin Watson boasted that his name does not appear on the SIU report so he is not implicated.    A copy of the SIU report was emailed to the hotel where we were staying in Paris.  Unfortunately I cannot remember the hotel’s name Chair.  Angelo Agrizzi collected the email from the email with the SIU report from the reception of the hotel and he studied the report during the course of our holiday.  I must say and I may add Chair that after the contents of this were discussed it actually interfered with our holiday as we were all extremely worried and stressed out about the content of the report Chair. And also during – at the same time Gavin Watson asked us to investigate and try and find out who had given such inside information to the SIU?  How it was leaked to the SIU?    Gavin Watson had that view Chair.    I did not know what the source was.    That is correct Chair.    Yes obviously his – Chair his organisation was implicated and there was a great risk to him.    Ja and I would say he was also concerned that it might spill over to him and implicate him himself Chair.    The fact that Mr Gavin Watson never signed 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 any documents himself that might incriminate himself.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I knew yes Chair.    Yes Chair I was told.    I was told by Gavin Watson that this was done to mitigate against the risk of Bosasa running out of funds in the cases of possible freezing applications of bank accounts – of account by the National Prosecuting 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Authority because of the SIU matter.    It would act as a war chest.    From time to time Bosasa needed cash for cash flow purposes to be transferred back to Bosasa in order to pay suppliers salaries etcetera if payments from clients were not in time.  And this R25 million is an example thereof that we – that there was a request that R25 million be transferred from the attorney’s trust account back to Bosasa on a temporary basis to assist with a cash flow issue at the time.    That is correct Chair.    That is exactly right Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I am happy to continue Chair.

FRANS HENDRIK STEYN VORSTER:  Frans Hendrik Steyn Vorster.    No.    Yes.    So help me God. 
MR FRANS HENDRIK STEYN VORSTER:  Yes I do Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes I do Chair.    Yes Mr Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    I am giving it freely.    No Mr Chair.    Okay Chair I started off as a member of the South African Police Services in 1987 up to 1996 end of – end September 1996.  In 1996 I joined Dyambu Operations as from the 1 October and I was there until the end of October 2017.    When I started off Meritem was just bought over and the name was changed to Dyambu Operations and around 2000, 2001 the name changed to Bosasa Operations and just before I left on the 1 September 2017 the name changed to African Global Operations.    Chair my father was also an employee of Meritem and at those days he dealt with Patrick Gillingham who was at the Correctional Services as they were tendering for the Lindela Facility and we had a prior awaiting 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 facility for juveniles and that is how he met up with Patrick Gillingham as the youngsters and the immigrants were held at the various prisons and they cost them to be overcrowded and they had to be removed from there and that is how they met or how he met Patrick Gillingham.    My father was also working for Bosasa when Meritem changed to Dyambu.  He was working for Dyambu and he was working for Bosasa just before he passed away in October 2001.    I was at that stage running the central division.  I was heading up the central division and so that meant that a few mine hostels fell under me that I had to oversee as well as the Lindela Facility as well as the Juvenile Facility.    In or about 2001 Lindela Operations grew very quickly and I had to spend more time at the facility.  We introduced or we purchased vehicles that we purposes built to transport the illegal immigrants from the various police stations to the facility where we handed them over to the Department of Home Affairs that again would hand them back to us to accommodate them on their behalf.    In 2003 Gavin came to my office at the 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Lindela Facility Chair where he said he would like to speak to me alone and we went up to my office and he said to me that I need to get hold of Patrick again as he would love to tender for the catering contracts for Correctional Services.    At that stage it was not outsourced.    I approached Patrick and then carried on the relationship on Gavin’s request and instruction that Patrick had with my late father.  I explain to him that Bosasa would like to do and get involved in the catering sector in Correctional Services.  I then from there met with Patrick regularly and yes at a stage – do you want me to continue Chair?    At a stage I was called to Head Office by Gavin Watson.  We went to the vault where he would hand cash to me.  Those days it was not in the security bags as it was mentioned previously.  Those days it was handed to you – I had to put it in my pocket and then I would go to my office from where I would stack the money into an A4 envelope so that it would like it is documents.    Then I would meet with Patrick at a certain restaurant usually in the Pretoria Centurion area.  Chair and then we would discuss all the specs regarding the kitchens of Correctional Services and the menus and I would then hand over the envelope to Patrick and he would give me information in return that 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 I then would take back to the office and hand it over to Danny Mansell.    In the beginning it was bi-weekly, certain times we met every week.  It depended on how much information was needed and that would lead me in having more or less meetings with Mr Gillingham.    Chair this was in 2003.    That is correct Chair.    No it was not cash for every meeting that we held.  It was only when Gavin called me to Head Office that he gave me cash that cash would go with me.  I do not know if he had an agreement with Patrick or – but I did not question it at that stage as we did not question the man.  If he said just take this with and give it to Patrick that is what I did.    It varied from R10 000,00 sometimes it was R5 000,00 the most was around R20 000,00 in cash.    Chair it was not every month.  It was only when Gavin called me to the office and said here is some stuff that you must take with for Patrick.    That is when I then would go with Gavin to the vault, we will take the money out I will put it in my pocket.    And I will go to my office, put it in the envelope and take it with.    Ja well that led to us getting the catering contract that was awarded to us in 2004.    No unfortunately I was too busy at Lindela to concentrate on the value of the tender.    At that stage he was a Provincial Commissioner of I think that is just when he came back from KZN he was Mpumalanga, Limpopo and I think Gauteng, he was the Provincial Commissioner for all three provinces at that stage.    At that stage there was one.    He – when – after 1994 he was the Provincial Commissioner for Gauteng.  From there he went – he was transferred to the KZN province.  From the KZN province they brought him back and mainly was looking after Limpopo and Mpumalanga and then they added Gauteng again if I can remember correctly.    This was in 2004.  At that stage Mr Gillingham was not the CFO of Correctional Services although the project was given to him to run with and he was the project leader of the tender.    As I mentioned Chair it was given to Danny Mansell and he worked on a presentation and a strategy and to assist and give the specs through on the tender or for the tender committee and the contract.  At the end of 03 the team met with Correctional Services top management and made a 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 presentation to the attending Correctional Services officials before it was known that DCS would be outsourcing the catering services.    Mr Danny Mansell.    Made a presentation to the senior members of Correctional Services.    That is correct Chair.    No I was not – I was not present I would have been but something happened and I could not attend.    Unfortunately I do not know but it would have been the senior management that would have been some of the Provincial Commissioners and senior management of Correctional Services.    At that time Mr Mansell was consultant for Bosasa Operations.    Yes and I mentioned already that early in 04 Patrick Gillingham did the presentation regarding the outsourcing of the catering 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 services that was prepared for him by the Bosasa team.    He was making the presentation with Danny Mansell to senior management of Correctional Services.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  According to them it was needed to outsource it would save Correctional Services a lot of money.    I never met with Mr Tshivhase.    Gavin Watson had a good and close relationship with Mr Mti the Commissioner of Correctional Services and that led to Mr Gillingham be appointed in procurement for the tenders and from there he was appointed CFO and he was basically used as the driver of the process.  Because Mr Mti could not drive the process.  He had to approve.  So the driver that was needed was Patrick Gillingham and he drove the process so that Mr Mti could approve the process.    As mentioned Chair it was awarded to Bosasa in 2004.    After it was awarded Gavin came to me instructed me to meet up with Patrick Gillingham and assist him to procure a vehicle.  The vehicle that Patrick was looking for excuse me was a Mercedes E270.  At that stage he was driving a gold Mercedes E240 that he sold to the company. We as Bosasa bought the vehicle from him.  At that stage the vehicle – his vehicle or the trade-in vehicle was the value was about R80 – R90 000,00 and we paid him R155 000,00 for the vehicle.  So that money was paid in by Bosasa into Patrick Gillingham’s bank account.    The value of the old Mercedes that he was driving.    He had a E240.    Mileage was very high.  The value of the vehicle I can remember the left front light was broken and out of order and the mileage was very high and the offer that he had on the vehicle was if I can remember correctly between R80 and R90 000,00.    Of his car that he …    That he sold to Bosasa.    No we bought it then at the amount of R155 000,00.  So at a much higher – we paid much more for the vehicle than what it was worth.    And that money was paid directly into his bank account.    I did the deal Chair.    So I negotiated everything but he did the financing part.  He did himself on that specific vehicle.    In 2005 Gavin phoned me and said Frans you better get hold of Patrick he needs a car for his wife and I got hold of Patrick and I said yes Patrick how can I assist?  And he said no he would love to buy a VW Golf for his wife.  I then went to VW The Glen again negotiated the deal.  Then after everything was negotiated he phoned back and said but he wants a few extras on the vehicle.  Now the vehicle was already ordered.  I was not involved in the finance of that vehicle but Doctor Smith deposited the money into Patrick’s account and he settled the vehicle.  30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 So I had to issue a Bosasa order for the extras on the vehicle and Bosasa also paid for the extras on the vehicle.    It is fourteen years back unfortunately I cannot tell you now how much it was.    2005 I was still heading up the central division so that meant – and Lindela at that stage got so busy that it took up a lot of my time.    Mr Gillingham had that relationship with my father and he knew exactly that when it came to vehicles he only dealt with or my father at that stage he passed away so he only dealt with me.  Because he knew that I could negotiate the best deal at that stage.    During April 2006 Gavin phoned me and said Frans Patrick’s son needs a vehicle.  I went to VW Krugersdorp the local dealership.  I negotiated the whole deal and Mr Mansell through his company paid for that specific vehicle.  Patrick could not take delivery of the vehicle so I had to take delivery of the vehicle, drove it through to Pretoria and I handed it to him in Pretoria.    This one was for his son. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Let me just assist you there Chair.  The second son.    Ja the oldest son never received the vehicle.    The mid – middle child so the second son he received also a vehicle.    The mother.    Ja and then in one vehicle well we will get to a second Mercedes that I had to buy for him.    But the daughter I was not available I was on leave and Andries Van Tonder had to deal with that one.    In – Chair you are quite right if you say it  was time for an upgrade.  The E270 gave a bit of problems before it reached 100 000    That is correct Sir.  From Mr Watson.  He phoned me Chair and he said Patrick needs a new vehicle.    This was a Mercedes E320.    Well at that stage it was and I refer to it in my statement because it is the truth at that stage it was a situation when Mr Tony Yengeni had a problem with the Mercedes, his Mercedes and Mercedes changed their procedure of which I was – I did not know about.  So I did not have Mr Gillingham’s new residential address as he moved from Centurion to Midstream.  So I then had to order the E320 in my name.    So what happened there was when the – it was close to delivery date we went together to Mercedes and this vehicle was ordered from Constantia Kloof Mercedes and we said okay I am not – I am no longer going to buy the vehicle but Patrick Gillingham will be buying this vehicle and they said to me sorry Frans it is not that easy.  Procedure has been changed if you order a car in your name and you not taking that car only a family member or a partner in business can take over that vehicle from you.  And I was basically then forced to go and buy a Shelf CC and that is the one that I referred to in my statement it is Oakridge Trading 114CC.  There were only two members in that CC it was myself and Patrick Gillingham and we used that CC as a way to. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    To say we were partners here is the proof because I had to take the documents to Mercedes and show them that we are partners so that I could transfer the vehicle over to Patrick Gillingham.    Before – Chair before I get to this contract between myself and Mr Patrick Gillingham.    We had to pay in R180 000,00 on this new E320 Mercedes.      That is Bosasa.      So that created a problem and the money went through a few bank accounts as been stipulated in the SIU report.    And we then had to pay over the money.  I was called in and the plan that we made for this deal was to say okay Angelo Agrizzi at that stage would receive a bonus.  I then went to Angelo and said okay Angelo I need 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 some money can you borrow me some money and he said Frans no problem I am getting a bonus this month I will just make sure that they pay over the bonus to you and then I said okay Angelo in December I am getting bonus and then I will refund you.  Alright.    So he phoned Carlos Bonifacio and he instructed Carlos to pay over the money to me.  I went to Carlos and I said Carlos do not pay the money to me pay the money directly into Patrick Gillingham’s bank account.    I then got a disciplinary hearing that they held on me, a pretended one.    It is also in my …    That is correct Sir.  Remember we had the E270.    We sold the E270.    Then the shortfall was R180 000,00.    Bosasa had to pay the R180 000,00.    That went …    It started from Bosasa.    Then paid to Mr Agrizzi.    As a bonus from there it went to one – it went to I think if I can remember correctly it went through to Carlos Bonifacio’s account.    Then to the lady working for Carlos into her account.    Then back to Bosasa and then from Bosasa it went through to Mr Gillingham’s account.    At that stage we needed the money urgently so it would just delay it.  Mr Gillingham wanted his new car.  So – and he could not take delivery if we do not settle the outstanding amount.    Top confuse any person that would investigate.    The case. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    No.    Ja.    Like I said I had to pretend that I mislead the company with the relationship that I had with Gillingham and.    Chair also to mislead any person that would investigate if need be I was given a notice to attend an enquiry.    And a lot of charges were added to that.  That disciplinary hearing never took place.  It was just being put there if – if we need to use it if the company would be investigated they could say Frans Vorster was the culprit and we dealt with him accordingly.  Now    That is correct Chair.  It was a smoke screen.    It never took place.    We only did the paperwork.    Because Mr Chair if you look at page 19.    For the offences there just to get a final written warning that meant I was very lucky.    Mr Agrizzi was the complainant.  Mr Gumede that is now the chairman of the company was supposed to be the chairperson.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.  Now we can go back to ..    Well this…    Chair that was a decision that was taken by Gavin, Angelo, myself, the group at that stage.    That is correct Chair.    That was an instruction basically that came from Gavin saying how are we going to handle this scenario?    The SIU picked up on this money now.    How are we dealing with it?    That is correct.    Okay, Gavin Watson wanted all of us to have written agreements with Patrick Gillingham to protect ourselves, to protect the company and to protect Patrick Gillingham and we were taken to an attorney and he 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 back dated and he drew up the agreement that was between myself and Patrick Gillingham.    This document was produced a day before we signed it and it was signed on 4 April 2007.    If we go back to the statement you will see, let me just get there.    In February 2007 I was instructed to procure the vehicle.  At that stage the vehicle came two and a half months later.    And Patrick took delivery of his vehicle.  When they found out, when they first heard about the SIU that would come and raid our offices.    They said that we need to get contracts in place between all the role players, so they backdated it then to 2007.    2007.    It was produced in 2007 a bit later, but backdated so it was later in the year but we backdated it to April 2007. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Chair, we signed it, it was much later in 07, I cannot recall…[intervenes]    No, I cannot recall the date, but we backdated it so that it was close to the delivery date of the vehicle.    Page 16 is my signature.    That is the signature of Patrick Gillingham.    Chair, that was Gavin Watson′s idea, but I do not know if Andries added his, but he also had a contract that was drawn up then the contract between Angelo and myself, I was looking for that, I could not find it, there was a contract between the two of us for him paying me his bonus and then I would have paid him back my bonus, but that money, my bonus did go through my bank account.    I paid tax on that. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    At the end of the financial year, although I had to pay it back to Angelo and he paid it back to the company.    Chair, it did not precede the transaction it only, Gavin decided that it needs to be done after we found out that there is a possible investigation from SIU side.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    Mr Gillingham got two himself.    Two Mercedes.    His wife got a Golf, his son got a Polo and the one that Andries van Tonder bought was for the daughter that was also a Polo, so 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 according to me it was two, three, four vehicles.    Two, three, four, five vehicles, sorry, Chair.    Five vehicles.    Sorry, Chair, Mr Agrizzi with me.    Not with Patrick.  Then myself with Patrick Gillingham.    For this specific vehicle the E320.    And then Mr van Tonder with Mr Gillingham for the Polo for the daughter.    Well it was common knowledge that we had to or the rumour, not the rumour, those that were close, Patrick told me that we are busy building a house for him and we also used Riaan Hoeksma from Riekele Construction that was well known to me as the person the builder building the house. So I was aware of the house that was built for Mr Gillingham.    Well I was aware of the house of Mr Mti at Savannah Hills that Mr Hoeksma also built for the company for Mr Mti to stay in the house.    Riaan Hoeksma.    Well Riaan Hoeksma like I said he became a service provider to the group through my father at that stage as my father was heading up procurement and we did a lot of maintenance especially on the kitchens on the hostels, we build it, big high walls around the Lindela facility, around the two North hostels and around the Luiperdsvlei hostel where also later changed Luiperdsvlei to the prawn farm that would also be discussed later in the SARS query that will also come up in my statement.    Okay 20 refers to the vehicle not the houses, but it was the houses were not paid directly so if you do not know where to 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 look you will not – you will not find, but it was indirectly paid through – Bosasa paid for the houses, but they had many ways as I just explained on the one vehicle they used various companies and ways and means to deal with that.  So you will not just go there and just pick it up, because the external auditors could not pick it up.    So if you do not know what to look for and where to look for you will not be able to get the invoices, but it did go through the books.    Again I was instructed in 2005 to procure a vehicle for Mr Mti.  It was a VW Toureg V8 silver in colour.  I did the whole deal – I negotiated the whole deal, the vehicle was purchased from Lindsey Suiker Krugersdorp and I was not part of the finances.  How they handled the finances on that deal.  What happened the SIU started with their investigation a bit later in 2007/8 I think, I got a phone call from the dealership and said hey SIU is here, they are asking a lot of questions about Mr Mti′s vehicle and what needs to be done and I said well give them the answers and they then said okay, what they are going to do, they will assist them, but they will not hand over the file to them. So the file was taken away from the dealership and the file was destroyed by myself.    They phoned me, I went to the dealership, I collected the file, I did not even check what was in the file, I placed the orders 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 everything so my name and everything appeared in there and I destroyed the file.    The dealer came and said, yes, Chair, well it was not the dealer itself it was one of the employees at the dealership.    They knew my intention, they knew what it was all about.    To destroy the file.    I burned the file.    Yes.    This was close to between 2007/2008 when the SIU just started with their investigation.    They went to the dealership, Chair, and they could not find the file.  They took a full statement from the dealership and they took a full statement from the salesperson that dealt with me.    No idea sir, I have not seen…[intervenes]    I have not seen that statement.    I cannot say whether it was paid by Bosasa, I presume it was paid for by Bosasa.    That is correct, Chair, I was asked by Mr Watson to go and get the file and destroy the file.  So I was not aware exactly how the finances took place.  I just followed the instruction, like I said I did not know, I was not involved in the financial part of that specific vehicle.    So I did not even open to see whether it was paid by Bosasa.    Was it paid cash.    How it was paid, I just took the file and I just burned the file. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Yes, Chair.    Okay then when I handed now everything to Danny Mansell I had to concentrate on Lindela to make a lot of money so that we could pay Riekele Construction for all the work that was done.  Gavin came to me and instructed me to get the figures up, he needed more money, he wanted more money.  We got paid per person per day staying over in the facility so he wanted us to get the numbers up.    At that stage we purchased buses and trucks and they were purposely built for us, they would look exactly like the vehicles from the South African Police Services that they used to transport prisoners between the police cells prisons and the courts.  Ours were just much bigger.  Theirs is about 3/4 ton we used 8 and 10 ton vehicles with the same more or less body on. We then went to the various police stations and assisted them in transporting the people to the Lindela facility.  The police had no problem with that as they had a shortage of manpower.  They had a shortage of vehicles and it was always a problem, because they had one vehicle that need to pick up prisoners from the prisons and take 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 them court.  So it was also always an issue to get the illegals to the facility. So we climbed in there as an ex-policeman station commander I knew most of the people and we spoke to them and they agreed that we could pick up the people and transport them to Lindela where we would hand them over to Home Affairs and then Home Affairs would do their job and hand them back to us to accommodate them.    Well I also had a team, two teams of security officers as we were a registered security company as well that worked with the SAPS.  They would book us in advance then we would assist them.  They would catch the people, we will then load them onto our vehicles, transport them to the various police stations.  There they would do the paperwork.  We would then load them back onto our vehicles, transport them to the Lindela facility where we would hand them over. So I had vehicles going around to various police stations and then I had teams with vehicles that were operating with the members of the SAPS.  I had one team looking after the West Rand and Johannesburg and then I had one team looking after the Pretoria area and the East Rand.    Chair, at a stage we had two buses and six trucks.    That could pick up people, but you would know today the police will – we would in the morning I had a team, they would come in, they would phone the police and say okay Sandton police how many illegal 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 immigrants?  Six.  You will phone Honeydew they will say four, so you would go you will pick up six from there you will go to Honeydew and pick up the four so it was until we had a bus load full and then we would bring them through to the facility.    At this stage, Chair, we had enough beds for 5 000 immigrants, but at a stage Hillbrow had a massive operation where the SAPS immigration they then phoned us and immigration also came to us to assist where they had the massive operation and they arrested a lot of people and at that stage we pushed up the figure to about nearly 7 000 immigrants in the facility. What we would do is we would get extra mattresses in, it was bunk beds so you would have one sleeping at the bottom one on top and then between the beds you would lay down a mattress where the other people then would sleep on.  So that is how we pushed up the number as we got paid per person per day.    Chair, we started off when we started the company I can remember it was R28,99 per person per day.  When I left there I am speaking now under correction it was close to R45,00 per person per day.    I left – I was transferred from Lindela in 06.    Yes, and then usually the numbers will go up around the festive season, because Transnet could not provide trains to Home Affairs to deport the people back, because the Mozambique and Zimbabweans they would deport them by train and then immigration officers and members from the South African Police Services would man the train.  So usually at the end of November the last trains will go through and then again here the last week in January then the first trains again for the new year and as the police were arresting people the numbers grew just bigger, bigger, bigger over the festive season as well. So the company was smiling, they did not complain.   We were working very hard over the festive seasons, because we had to keep these guys calm, everybody then wanted to go home and you would always have a lot of riots in the facility when Home Affairs could not assist the people to be deported.    Well I was heading up the facility.  I had a lot of managers reporting to me from that facility and I was also responsible for the invoice that we invoiced Home Affairs to be taken to the Head Office of Home Affairs. Those days we were not paid by EFT, they still issued cheques and I would hand in the invoice and I will sit and wait until they give me my cheque and that was part of my responsibility and then I would come back with the cheque and hand the cheque to Andries van Tonder to be paid into the bank account.    2006 was a very good year at the Lindela facility.    We finished the budget for the Lindela facility that was allocated by Home Affairs in six months.  In the half year budget and at that stage Mr Trevor Manuel was the Minister of Finance and in his half year speech he mentioned that he had to allocate another R120-million to the Lindela facility, because at that stage we had so many people in the facility and we used up the budget that was allocated to the facility in six months.    At the end of 2006 round, during the year he became the Director General Mr Frazer of Home Affairs.  To the end of 2006 he came to the facility and he was you know I think he was under pressure for not be able to explain why the budget was used in that short period of time.    He came and from there on he had the discussion with our Directors and myself and immigration officers, top management of immigration where he issued an instruction that Bosasa or Bosasa security Lindela would not be allowed to transport any people from the South African Police Services or assist if the South African Polices had special operations where they went out to catch the illegal immigrants. I then had to speak to a few reservist and you know they did not get paid by the South African Police Services, they were full members, they had uniform, they would go and book on duty and then I would use them to drive the vehicles, to man the 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 vehicles, to pick up the various people from the police stations and still take them through to the Lindela facility.    Mr Frazer also came and Home Affairs made it difficult, because they found out that we used police reservists and they put a stop to that and the numbers came down tremendously.  The count was nearly half the count that it used to be.    And Gavin was upset with me for that and he wanted to get rid of me.  He used me, he abused me now he wanted to get rid of me.  So usually if you are in trouble they would transfer you to Lindela and you would resign 99.9% of the guys would resign in a month.  Now I ran Lindela it was nothing for me so they transferred me to the technical division as a junior.  I had nothing to do basically there.  To belittle me in the hope that I would resign of which I did not do. The oke heading up technical felt bad and he at that stage gave me the fleet of the group to run as we also had our own workshop where we serviced the vehicles and vehicles then became my responsibility.    That was 2007.    Beginning of 2007.    Sorry, Chair, before that…[intervenes] 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Angelo then in 2008, because you are jumping that that paragraph, he transferred me.    To Head Office to become the Head of Procurement, Logistics and I kept vehicles.  So I was heading up the whole Procurement Division for the Group.    As from 2008.    During the middle of 2008 Gavin came to my office with a gentleman and he introduces that gentleman to me as Kevin Wakeford.  I did not really know Kevin.  I saw his vehicle and I saw him a few times at the front offices where the Directors were sitting and he said to me that Kevin would phone me regularly to order cement and that I had, need to assist him and I must give him what he wants.    At that stage I was not aware exactly what the relationship between him and Gavin was.  Sometimes you did not question Gavin and ask him why he, he did certain things.  He would often tell you just do what I tell you to do.  If I ask you to do this just do it.  You are a White man and there is no job for you on the outside and I will make sure that you do not get another job.  So just do what I tell you to do.  So you would follow instructions especially if he had a crowd of 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 people with him like at this stage it was Kevin Wakeford and there were some of the Directors with.  So you did not, you did not question the man especially not in front of a crowd of people.    Say again.    Definitely.  Well he, Gavin is one of those guys in front of a crowd he, he would take you head on.  One on one, he will you take you on.    He needed a crowd.    Hm.    In 2009 Gavin Watson called me and said that Kevin will speak to me and instruct me to buy and deliver wet and dry cement.  Now Chair if I refer to wet cement that is cement that you order that comes in these big trucks that has been mixed.  It is mixed according to your specification.  So it cannot be used by somebody else.  If you do not use the, the whole truck full of cement they would dump it somewhere, but that is what is referred to as wet cement.  Now I had to.    Order wet cement from W G Wearne in Randfontein.  Now if you.    [Intervenes] cement, a bag of cement that 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 you would buy.    That is not ordered specific.    Specifically.    So we, I had to place orders for, excuse me.  If he wanted wet cement he will phone me and.    Mr Wakeford would phone me and say Frans I need 20 cubes or 30 cubes wet cement and he would give me exactly the specs what he needed to be mixed according to and then he gave me a specific address where this cement needed to be delivered.  Now the address that was given to me was at Meyer Park Eco Estate in Meyerton.  Now wet cement like I mentioned was ordered from W G Wearne and.    Sometimes I had to order dry cement.  A truck full at a stage that was ordered from Randfontein Trading Centre called RTC and of which we had an account with them.  I would phone Butch who was the husband of the owner and say Butch I need 10 tons or 15 tons cement to be delivered to Meyer Park Eco Estate and I would issue the order, give him the order number and he would make sure that it gets delivered to the specific address.    I understand at the end of the day that 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 Kevin assisted through another person which he was the owner of the vehicle.  This I found out after I did some of my own investigations, to assist Bosasa in a SARS matter.    According to my knowledge the person was George Papadakis.    That is correct.  He is the, he is the owner of the house at Meyer Park Eco Estate.  At that stage we had no street number, because it was new.  So you only had a strand number, but if you ask at the gate they would tell you exactly where to deliver, to deliver the stuff.    It looks like Mr Wakeford was just a middle man between Bosasa and George Papadakis.    Chair it was over a period of time.  It was nearly a year over a period of a year.    Of a year.    So he would not every week phone me.  He would phone me as and when needed.    Chair it was roundabout R600 000 cement at that stage.    All in all.    Because at the stage I thought these okes are building a palace, because.    Of, of, of the number of cement that they needed.    Well I, I.    I, I can remember I, I, I sort of on the side-line, I do not have it with me.  I kept book more or less of the amounts that that, that was ordered.    So I could, I could see more or less how much it was, because if I got questioned that by accounts or by Mr Watson I could answer him.    Okay.  So we going back.  At Technical I 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 was more or less one year, at the Technical Division before I was transferred to Head Office and became the Head of Procurement.    July 2011 I was called by Angelo Agrizzi and said that they have a massive problem at Kgwerano Financial Services where we had the contract with Government to be the maintenance plan for subsidised vehicles and the contract was a RT62 Contract.  They were running at a loss of nearly R2 million a month and I had to go and fix it.    So, so I was called in by Angelo and by Gavin, sat down and said this is the last chance.  I must go and fix it.  If I cannot fix it then they will have to terminate the contract or try and get out of the contract.    W.    R-A-N-O.    Kgwerano Financial Services.    I was the Head of Operations.    Well I was responsible for everything at Kgwerano Financial Services.  I had to deal with the clients although I had members that, in every province, Relation Officers and Managers who dealt with the clients.  So I 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 had to oversee all nine provinces on their side.  I had the Call Centre reporting to me with two Managers on everything that we did on the vehicles and I had to get the contract back in line to start making money.  The only thing that we did to get it back inline I had to retrench two Senior Managers.    And that caused a lot of problems of which I dealt with and then in three months I, I turned the company around to, to break even.  When I left in the end of October beginning November 2017 the loan account from; that Bosasa had with Kgwerano Financial Services was nearly R19 million.  So I had, I had turned that whole contract around to the extent where I had to show 7.5 percent of net profit before tax that we paid over to Bosasa as well.  At that stage Mr Leshabane wanted to negotiate a, a salary increase for the Directors and we had to hide the financials.  So it did not look that good.  So, and that was also one of the reasons we, we had to that, but we turned that whole contract around.  The only thing that I did I worked strictly according to the contract.    I got certain Managers in certain positions and we stuck strictly according to the contract and that is that is how we turned it around.  Just by doing proper work and be disciplined in what we did.    2013.  Okay that was one of the, the dates that you had to change.  So that was October 2017.    Paragraph 31? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Yes, 9 October 2017.    Remember we discussed.    That the date was wrong there?    I became.    I became the HOD in 2011 already not October 2013.    That also needs to be changed.    Sorry, Chair.    That is [indistinct].    No, sorry Chair.  I made a mistake there.    That I, I see now.  That one must, must be 13.    The, the, the second one.    Ja, in line one, two, three, four in line five.    It must stay.    Okay.    That is that is where we dealt with the SARS query where SARS queried us moving equipment from SeaArk in PE up to Gauteng.  They prepared, Pauline came to me and she had a, a statement prepared for me to say that I used our own vehicles to transport the equipment from PE to Gauteng.  I also had to change certain entries in the logbooks of these vehicles.    To prove that these vehicles were in PE and that they did collect the equipment and they brought the equipment back. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Okay.  If we, I just want to see the attachment.  There is an attachment.    Okay.  I would read the one on page 28 first, because that was the first one and the second one was on page 27.  They drew up the statement and I had to sign it though I was not happy with it.    It says   “Hereby confirm the following   That is the document, page 27.    It reads affidavit. “I the undersigned again full names, ID number, confirm the    And I had to sign it, dated 18 March 2014.  Unfortunately I did not have the second part of this document where it was commissioned again by Colleen.    That was to mislead SARS where apparently I understand there were 44 million SARS queries that the company had to handle and I understand that Andries van Tonder dealt with the whole enquiry already.    Colleen, Colleen.    Yes.    Colleen, it is a lady.    It is a lady.    She was, she is a CA in the company in the Accounts Department.  So she is a Chartered Accountant.    No, she was aware.    They forced me to sign this.  I did not want to sign this.  They even commissioned it before it was sent to me to be signed.    Colleen, she commissioned it as the, as Commissioner of Oaths.    Colleen prepared the affidavit.    Chair it came to, after a discussion, it came to the; it was pointed out that there was a SARS query of R44 million that we had to deal with between the prawn farm that we had at SeaArk.  So to get that sorted out we had to prove that we moved a lot of the equipment that was at SeaArk in PE that we moved that equipment to our Gauteng operations.    So, and that was why I had to do the statements and that is why I had to do certain entries into the logbooks of the vehicles.    These three logbooks were then confiscated and they were locked up in one of the vaults of Mr Watson.    Chair yes, this was not the first time, but we will deal with this one.  In, at the end of November Gavin phoned me and said Frans.    That was.    November 2015.    Frans, Minister Mokonyane’s daughter needs a vehicle.  She wants a Cabriolet.  Please make sure that you get a Cabriolet.  Rent the vehicle in your name and deliver the vehicle to her house, to the daughter.    Why he did not ask Angelo to do that, because at that stage Angelo was handling the daughter.  I was not involved with, with that anymore, but it looks like he was upset with Angelo and he phoned me.    To do so.  I phoned.    Angelo, Mr Agrizzi, yes.    Yes, Chair.  So I, I, I used, well we usually used Brian Travel, Blakes Travel.    So I phoned Brian directly, speak to Brian.  I said Brian I need a Cabriolet.  It is for the Minister’s daughter.  It is urgent.  It is senior.  Please get me a Cabriolet.  He was phoning all over.  He came back to me.    Brian, yes from Blakes.    No, Brian the owner of Blakes Travel.    I spoke to him directly.    Blake, Brian.    So there; that is why it is Blakes Travel, Chair.    So I spoke to Brian.  I said please get me a Cabriolet.  He tried all over the country.  He came back to me.  He said Frans I cannot get a Cabriolet.  It is festive season.  All the Cabriolets are rented already.  I can get one, but it is in Cape Town.  I said, I am not flying down to Cape Town to drive a vehicle back.  So I phoned Gavin and I said Gavin I cannot get a Cabriolet.  Can we not a small luxury vehicle for her to drive with and he said Frans if you get a Cabriolet then get a luxury vehicle.  So. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    A luxury vehicle.    So we ordered an Audi A3 silver in colour.  Blakes rented that from Bidvest Rentals in Krugersdorp and they are situated in Voortrekker Road and I had to pick up the vehicle and take it through to the Minister’s house.  At that stage she as a Minister of Water Affairs.  Now knowing previously that she bumped the vehicle I insisted.    Knowing that she previously, when we rented vehicles for her she bumped the vehicles.    This was not the first time Chair.    As I have mentioned.    I said she needs to be added as a second driver on the account.  If.    I was the first driver.    She was the second driver, okay.  So I forced them to get a copy of her driver’s licence so that I could send it through to Blakes so that they could add her as the second driver.  I was afraid that she would write off the vehicle and then we need to pay four or R500 000 in, because she was not 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 added as a driver.  Okay, so I arranged with Richard le Roux to assist me to pick up the vehicle as he was working a lot at the Minister’s house.    Richard le Roux is an employee of Sondolo IT.  He was working on special projects.  So he was working a lot at the Minister’s house.    So I asked him just to accompany me so that we could collect the vehicle from Bidvest.  I signed for the vehicle everything.  He drove the vehicle to the Minister’s house in Krugersdorp there in Noordheuwel and we parked the vehicle, handed over the key and I left the vehicle there.  Now this vehicle we would have only rented for the month of December.    To the end of December I was phoned again by the daughter and said she needs to extend the rental.  So I phoned Gavin Watson, I said Gavin I am not going to take this on me.  Do we extend this yes or no?  He said to me Frans do whatever she wants.  So it was extended till mid-January.  In mid-January she phoned me again and said we need to extend it to the end of January.    This is now 2016.  So I extended the vehicle.  Every time I just had to get the kilometre reading and give it through to Bidvest because they had to book it out again on a new invoice.    So they needed the opening and the 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 closing kilometres.  So she had to send through the kilometres.  She phoned it through to me and I gave it through to Bidvest so that we could extend the vehicle every time.  So at the, at the, at the end of January 2016 I asked Richard to accompany me to go and fetch the vehicle.  I just dropped Richard off at the gate and I.    That is Mr Le Roux, Richard le Roux Chair and he phoned me and said Mr Vorster or he calls me Oom Frans.  He says Oom Frans please I am not taking this vehicle.  This vehicle is bumped.  I said, how do you mean it is bumped Richard?  He says Oom Frans it is bumped at the back.  I said okay I am turning around.  So I had to turn around.  I had to go and see the vehicle for myself.  So the vehicle was bumped at the back.  It was not serious, but it was bumped.  So I said Richard let us take the vehicle.  Let us take the vehicle back.  We took it back to Bidvest.  They insisted as the vehicle was rented in my name.  I had to complete the paperwork.  So I did all the paperwork as if I was driving the vehicle.    So we did all of that and we handed all of that to, to Bidvest.    Chair I just I reversed and I did not see the pole behind me and I hit the pole.  It was on the bumper left back.  Like I say it was not that serious, but it was a few thousand Rands damage.    Especially on an Audi.    Well Bosasa had to pay the access.  It was added to, to the bill.  This caused a lot of problems.  I have not even mentioned it here in my statement.    But I can mention to you.    That I got phoned by Angelo because…    Mr Agrizzi     Sorry Chair as he – the agreement was if one of the seniors is doing something the other senior would countersign and sign it off before it gets paid.  Now Mr Watson thought that okay Frans is going to sign if off. Mr Agrizzi will not know about it and it will go through the normal channels and nothing would happen.  So Mr Agrizzi phoned me and said Frans I see you rented a vehicle for two months what is it for?  And I said, Mr Agrizzi I say this is for Mr – Mrs Nomvula’s daughter because it was a big amount a luxury vehicle for two months.    And the excess on the damage of the vehicle came to a big amount.    I cannot remember Chair.    The amount was – it was high, it was close to R100 000,00. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    For the rental for the two months plus the excess.    And Angelo was annoyed.  He then had a discussion with Gavin Watson.  Gavin Watson was very upset with me, he phoned me.  And he shout at me.  I was so embarrassed I had some of my managers sitting in front of me and they could hear the whole conversation.  They felt so embarrassed that they  stood up and they walked out of my office.  Where he fired me on the telephone for – and his reason was that I am trying to bring him – I am trying to create problems for him. That was his words.  You trying to create problems for me.  And I said but Gavin what is the issue?  If I have signed it you know that Mr Angelo Agrizzi must countersign it so I followed your instruction now you want to fire me?  But in any case it is fine I will deal with it.      No he was unhappy.    He was unhappy because I reported it to Angelo.  But – Mr Agrizzi because Mr Agrizzi had to sign.  I signed everything off then accounts would take to him to countersign.  If he is not there Mr Andries Van Tonder will – the CFO will countersign as long as there is two seniors signature on there.    Mine plus or Mr Agrizzi or Mr Van Tonder.    In this stage it was Mr Agrizzi that had to sign because they took everything to him.  So he confronted Mr Watson, he was upset and he phoned me and he was upset.    It was not the first time Mr Chair.    But ja I got fired telephonically.    I phoned Mr Agrizzi I said Angelo what is – what is his story now?  He said Frans come to my office.  So I went to Mr Agrizzi’s office and we had a discussion and he said to me, relax, just relax.  I will deal with it and nothing came of it after that.  But again for a long time I was threatened.  If he walked past my office he would belittle me especially if he had a crowd of people with him you know he would always say because he does not like big people so he would say yeah there is fat Fransie you know he is creating problems for me.  And he is going to lose his job.  And I said, yes Gavin it is fine we will – we will handle it.  That was always my response but I knew that if he could fire me he would fire me there and then.  And sometimes it was more than threats that it is like Mr Agrizzi mentioned there were a dustbin and if your name were in that dustbin they had to work you out.  And that was not the first time that they had to work me out.    That is correct Chair.    16.    That is correct Sir.    Well it happened a few times before where I was involved personally and then it was given to Mr Agrizzi to handle because it was the minister’s daughter and they did not want me to handle it anymore.  So Mr Agrizzi would have handled it and then suddenly in November 2015 at the end of November I got phoned again and say please Frans do the necessary.  So I did not question and say Gavin why are you not speaking to Angelo, Mr Agrizzi?  So – and he was adamant that I need to do it and that is exactly what I did.    I could not get the cabriolet and I gave him feedback the whole time.    I also do not know how many daughters she had got but it was for the same person.    Same person Mr Chair.    Chair that was the reason for this specific one.  The other times when she needed the vehicle apparently she is a student I do not know if she – whether she had her own vehicle or not but I on two previous occasions I had to rent a vehicle and then it was taken away from me and Mr Agrizzi handled it.    Where I handled it, I handled it ja.    The instruction was always and even to Mr Agrizzi who will rent a vehicle in your name.  They must not be able to link it to     To the daughter or to    To the minister’s details.    Chair I cannot tell you what was the reason why.  I was asked and I cannot tell you, you will have ask Mr Agrizzi what was the reason he and Mr Watson were arguing for me renting the vehicle for the daughter.  I cannot answer that. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Her residential address in Noordhill.    Chair I only went to that specific house twice.  That is when we delivered the vehicle.    And when we collected the vehicle.    But when she was staying in Kenmere Extension 1 I visited the house a few times.    She sold the house in Kenmere Chair and then she purchase the house in Noordhill.    No voice call.  She spoke to me and said she needs an extension and then I would always phone Mr Watson and say Sir can we extend it and he would say yes do whatever she asks you to do and then when I extended after the first time I knew I had to ask for the kilometres because the first time when I extended it they asked for the kilometres, she did not give it to me.  I had to phone back and say, just please give me the kilometre reading.  So when we extended 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 again in – at the end of December I already asked for the kilometre readings so that I could give it through to Bidvest and again in mid-January she already knew to give me the kilometre reading.    Cell phone, cell phone.    She – ja I had to give Mr Watson I gave – well he had my number so he gave her my cell phone number.    Well Ms Mokonyane she had a lot of influence and I am sure she opened a lot of doors for Mr Watson because we always had to jump when it was for her and make sure that she gets special treatment.  She was – she did not wait for anything.  If he said do that you would do it immediately and make sure whatever was asked was delivered.    Ja I often questioned Gavin, Angelo and the other directors why I had to drop everything to attend to the minister and the family and it became apparent over the years that she was the key person and link and had huge political contacts even to the previous president of South Africa and I had to do what I was instructed to do.    Say again? 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    That was even in Mr Mbeki’s time and Mr Zuma’s time because I – when she was staying in Kenmere that was early 2000’s.    That is correct Chari.    That is what I was told.    Well Gavin Watson.    It was not a secret Sir.    Amongst us seniors Sir.    In – let me just if that date    Yes Sir in 2016 I was approached by Johannes Gumede with the instruction to fix Mr Netshishivhe it is difficult for me pronounce maybe     That is correct Sir.    It was a Isuzu bakkie that he owned that was at Westvaal Motors in Nelspruit.    I then said – he said to me that it is on the instruction of Gavin Watson.  I said if that is the case because it was always said that Mr Watson will sign nothing.    Well I was lucky I got a signature because I just refused bluntly and said or Mr Gumede or Mr Watson will sign the quotation.    It was taken to Mr Watson.    And he is the man that put his signature. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    That is correct Chair page 23.  You will see that is Mr Watson’s signature.    That is one of the few times.  One of the lucky times where we got a signature from Mr Watson.    Sir according to my understanding he was sitting on the security cluster of the Mpumalanga Province and he had an influence to assist the company to get the security contract at the hospitals in the Mpumalanga Province.  And later on it – that was allocated to Bosasa.  As I as a fleet manager as well the group had to purchase a vehicle for them to fulfil their function in the province.    Relating hospitals Chair nothing.    That is correct Chair.    I am – it was a bit later but I am not hundred percent sure now I cannot remember the exact time when the contracts were allocated to the group.    Chair yes the original quote was for R16 000,00.    But then the workshop manager when I spoke to him to arrange for payment he said to me that there is other work that needs to be done as well and if we do not do that it is not worthwhile to spend the R16 000,00.  I spoke to Mr Johannes Gumede and informed him and he said go ahead.  So I said okay if you instruct me to go ahead we will go ahead and that is exactly what we have done.  And that is why the invoice came to the amount of R29 239,79.    Ja it is a Mr.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Paragraph?    36?    Chair I only used the one side of the call centre for my team.  The other side of the call centre was standing empty and in 2015 we were instructed to prepare for the ANC for them to run their national call centre from our facility.    Gavin Watson, Papa Leshabane and Joe the three of them came and said that we need to prepare and get that part of the call centre ready for the ANC to use for the elections, the national elections.    Mr Joe Gumede Mr Chair.    That was national elections.    I think it is.    Ja I think it was 2014 this is wrong it was 14 and they stayed – they stayed over for a period.  They did not vacate immediately.  They – but a correction that that was in 2014 not 2015.    The IT department had to set up their computers where they also had open phone lines for them to use.  So exactly what they  did from the call centre I am not a hundred percent sure.  There were about 20, 25 people that manned the call centre.    The expenses were carried by Kgwerano Financial Services.    K-g-w-e-r-a-n-o, Kgwerano    One of the companies in the group.    In the Bosasa Group Chair.    At the same time a massive marquee tent was set up in one of the parking areas in front of our national stores and that was handled by Alistair Esso.  Alistair was referred to as GM as he used to be general manager of a hotel.  He was a general manager of the office park and the restaurant 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43 that we had on the office park was also his responsibility.  We also had lots there where we had twenty rooms and where usually the people that would come for training would sleep over and be trained on our premises.  So we refer to Alistair always as a GM, the general manager.    He was full time employed by Bosasa Operations.    The marquees, the renting of the crockery, cutlery, the food, everything was paid for by Bosasa Operations.  He had to handle the full facility around – that was after the elections and the ANC won they had a massive function on the premises of Bosasa Operations.    This was an ANC function.    This was arranged with Alistair through Gavin.  The person from the ANC that drove the process was Minister Mokonyane. She drove the process.    Chair they set up everything.  It was there for about two weeks.    It was set up just before the elections so they were hundred percent sure they are going to win.  So – and after the function it took about a week to remove everything from the premises.    Chair that I cannot answer I have got no idea.    But it was a function for about 400 plus people so it cost a lot of money.    No Kgwerano did not pay for that one.    I had to carry the cost.    Of the people in the call centre so their tea, their coffee, their lunch, toilet paper, cleaning of bathrooms, all of that I had to carry on Kgwerano cost.    No that was – that was carried by head office.    Bosasa Head Office so I cannot answer that question I have got no idea. 30 JANUARY 2019 – DAY 43    Thank you Chair.
