CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.     Thank you.    We are back and are you ready Mr Pretorius?    Thank you.    Yes.    Can I just ...[intervenes].    Can I just confirm that everybody, particularly at the back can hear, already I see heads being shaken so they cannot hear at the back.  Does anybody know what is supposed to be done for everybody to hear?  Can you hearnow?  Can you hear now?  Yes thank you.  Okay, yes Mr Pretorius.    I guess when you say evidence relating to the appointment of advisors in the Ministry of Finance has been dealt with comprehensively, you do not want that to be understood to mean evidence in that regard has been completed because ...[intervenes].    Are still - ja, so there are still witnesses to be called.    Ja, I guess it might be important to emphasise that last part of 1.4"any other family, individual or corporate entity doing business with Government or any organ of State."    Ja.    110 000 or R110?    The right to apply for leave to cross-examine?    I understand that the witness himself is quite happy that he gives evidence in the open is that correct?    Yes.  No thank you very much.  I think that in relation to the decision of the legal team not to give prior written notice as contemplated in the rules, to implicated persons and not to furnish implicated persons with this witness'sstatement, what you have done is to put before me affidavits that seek to explain why that decision was taken.  On the face of it, it appears to me that subject to whatever any implicated person may wish to say or may say in due course, because I will leave that door open, it seems to me that prima facie there were good reasons for doing so.  But I think I should not make any decision, final decision in regard to whether they were good reasons or not, subject to what you may say, but allow the evidence to proceed and we see whether when implicated persons have been served or furnished with the statement and all documents including this affidavit, whether they want to make an issue of that.  That is my thinking.    Is that in order?  Would that be in order?    So therefore I will allow the evidence to be led, and to be led in the open, and as Mr Pretorius has indicated all implicated persons' rights in terms of the rules of this Commission, and the regulations other than the right to be informed in advance of the giving of evidence by a witness.  All those other rights will be complied – will be respected and the requirements of the rules will be complied with.  This means that Mr Agrizzi's statement and all relevant documents will be made available to them and then they have to put up their versions as well, and basically follow the rules.I just emphasise what I have said before, what we keep on saying, allimplicated persons, persons implicated by witnesses who come before this Commission will be dealt with fairly.  If they want to give evidence they will be given that opportunity.  If they want – they apply for leave to cross-examine, their applications will be considered properly and their versions will be given due consideration.  So I will take this opportunity to say to the witness who was about to give evidence, that whether or not his evidence will be found in the end to be truthful or not is a decision that I will take at some stage in the future, but I do want to take this opportunity at this stage to thank him for voluntarily coming up and deciding to come and testify.  We thank him for that.We encourage more people who know activities that happened, in which they may themselves have taken part, on which they know that other people took part which relate to corruption, bribery, State Capture, to come forward and share that information with us, and therefore with the nation on this very important issue, because the entire nation wants to know what happened, who did what with whom, that has led to where the country is now.So I thank Mr Agrizzi for coming forward voluntarily to share his knowledge with the Commission and to give evidence, and as I say whether or not his evidence is true, that is something that will be decided later but I thank him for coming forward.  Thank you.    Yes, administer the oath Registrar.    Thank you, you may proceed Mr Pretorius.    The one I have here is written on the spine Bundle 01, is that the one you say should be S1?    Okay we say Exhibit ...[intervenes].   Yes.  Yes.    So Exhibit S1 will be Bundle 01 is that right?    Yes.    So is that marking correct?    Okay, alright.    Then there is the lever arch file marked on the spine Bundle 01 and then it says volume 2 of 2 and that one will be Exhibit S2.  Thank you.    Yes.  So what I have here, the two bundles are both marked Bundle 01.    And then the one is further or is written Bundle 01.  The one is further written volume 1 of 2, and the other is written volume 2 of 2.    So the 01 applies to both bundles?    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  You made a reference just now to Exhibit 1, that is – where is the reference to Exhibit 1?  I just want to make sure that we – as we talk about theevidence in this bundle we do not cause confusion for the reader of the transcript in months to come, when we refer to Exhibit 1, whether that is a reference to the original Exhibit 1 that we had at the beginning.  So we just need to be careful.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Ja, ja.   Ja, so that can be done and if need be during the lunch break and/or after – in the afternoon after the adjournment somebody can just make sure we have the same numbering of those exhibits.    Thank you.    You may proceed.    Good morning Mr Agrizzi.   Okay thank you.    So I am sorry, before you say that, so in other words if thetranscript of today's evidence and the – or the transcript relating to Mr Agrizzi's evidence were to later on show that we are talking about page 1 or page 3 of his affidavit, and the reader goes there and finds page AA001, AA003, they must understand we are referring – we are not using the AA and 00, we are just using the actual number.    Ja okay.    One second before you proceed Mr Pretorius, earlier on before we had a witness using that mic, I checked whether everybody could hear, I now want to check that they can hear the witness clearly right at the back.  Yes, can you all hear the witness?  One says yes, another one shakes the head.  It looks like some cannot hear.    How is that?  I think they can hear.  Maybe you can raise your voice and the technical people can also do whatever they might be able to do to make sure that everybody can hear.  Thank you very much, we – let us proceed.    Ja it must not be too closed, but I think if you raise your voice it should ...[intervenes]    Very much better. Thank you.    Yes.  No, that is fine.  We will take the tea adjournment now, so it will    Yes Mr Pretorius     Yes.    Okay.  There is no need to cover what has been covered already.  We can continue or what is the issue.    Yes.    Okay.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Okay.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Ja.    Ja.  What I am thinking is whether in the light of the failure to…  Is it feed the public broadcaster, whether it is necessary to repeat essential fissures of what the witness has already said or whether it is not really necessary?   I do not know if you have thought about it.    Yes.    Okay.  You may proceed.   And what was Mr Gavin Watson’s position in Dyambu?    Okay.  Thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius, can I just take you back a little bit.    You said Mr Mansell was concerned about implications of yoursalary.    Was that because your salary was too high or what was the basis of the concern?    Oh okay.  Thank you.    Thank you.    So in other words there was the conclusion of some contract that was almost a foregone conclusion between Molope and them that was to happen?    Okay.  Alright. Mr Pretorius, it might help me if from time to time you indicate whereabouts in the statement you are as you lead him.    And the Union being what Union?    Thank you.    Well before – I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I may have missed this.  This agreement that was about to be signed between Molope and the Company and the Union, was it for the provision of catering services or what was it for?    And I may be that Mr Pretorius is still to deal with this and I am happy to let him deal with it in due course.  It just seems odd.  The inclusion of the Union seems odd in an agreement such as that.  Is there something you want to mention about that?      Yes just like that.    And not only in that company, but also in other companies maybe or not?    Oh and they would be included in the actual agreement.  Not just being consulted.  They would actually be included as party to the agreement.    Okay.  Well that is what I was trying – so you see, I understood you in response to a question put to you to be saying that the agreement was going to involve Molope, the Mine and the Union, so and I understood that to mean that the Union will be party to the agreement, but maybe you meant that the Union had some role but not necessarily that they would be party to the agreement.  Is that right?    Okay.  Thank you.    Before your proceed, you said that when you made this decision, a car had already been delivered to you.  Does that mean that as part of your terms and conditions of employment with Dyambu, you were going to be given a car?    And at Molope, was that part of your terms and conditions or that was one of the differences between the two.    In favour of?    Yes.  Yes.  Okay thank you.    Well in terms of your resignation from Molope, were you required in terms of your terms of employment to give any notice of resignation and if so, did you give it?    Yes.   Yes.    Okay.    What motivation did you give as to why they should not sign, because I assume that in your capacity in which you were employed at Molope, you may have taken the view that Molope should get it, so what did you say to them that convinced them not to continue and sign the agreement?    Thank you.    And this might have in part at least being due to the reputation that you already had in the industry in the sector prior to joining Dyambu.    Okay.    Is what is wrong, is just the year.    Oh.  Okay.    The one is 6.18.  The other one?    Oh yes.  So that is corrected to saying 1998. Thank you.    I am sorry ...[intervenes]    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  The incident that the witness has testified about, of money being given to Mr Jackson Mafeka, are you still going to come back to it later or ...[intervenes]    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  Okay that is – let me ask this question.  On the day when you say you were present when money was given to this particular leader of the Union, are you saying money was given to him because you saw a bag that used to be used when people were being given money being given to him or are you saying you did actually see the cash as well?    Okay, but based on your knowledge of a certain practice you took itthat what he was being given was money.    Okay.  Thank you.    At Molope, you said that you were employed in a marketing position.  What was the actual position called?  Were you a marketing manager or what were you called?    Oh okay.  I may have misunderstood.    And at Dyambu, when you were employed, what was the position called in which you were appointed?    And when the company was rebranded as you say and called Bosasa, did your title change or not?    Yes.  Okay, but what was your position?  Was it still the same?    Yes, but what I want to know is, whether you were called operationsmanager or what was the position that were you occupying called or was there no particular name given?    And business cards, if you had any, what did they say you were?    Marketing Manager?    Coordinator.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  I just wanted to make sure that we know exactly what your position was called.  Thank you.  You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Do you want us to stand down to give you time to ...[intervenes]    Okay.    Mr Pretorius.  Mr Pretorius sorry.  I am looking at the witness.  I think he may have something that he is thinking about whether to say or not.  Maybe he might be needing a little bit some time.  I wanted to see whether we should adjourn for5 minutes, but he says no.      But maybe we must just give him time to say whether he wants to say anything further before your next question.    Okay.  That is fine.   Thank you.    Well you can speak without referring to the statement, if your recollection is quite fine, but if you do need to refer to the statement, feel free to do so, because this is a long time ago, so ja.    I am sorry before he answers that Mr Pretorius, just for the sake of completeness, in the light of the second agreement, ANNEXURE C,  your relationship with Bosasa had become that of a consultant.  Is that right?    Okay. Thank you.  You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Okay maybe let me see if I can ask this.    The one thing you say here in the relevant paragraph is that what was your salary was given or part of what was your salary or was meant to be your salary, was given to you and another part was given to your wife.    Okay.  Maybe before we proceed, was your wife employed by Dyambu/Bosasa when this all happened?    So she was not employed by Dyambu or Bosasa.    Yes.  Now in relation to tax.    Was the salary that would have been represented to the tax authorities as the salary that you were being paid by Dyambu or Bosasa?  Was it only the part that was given to you, in other words was the part that was given to youreflected as the complete salary or was it indicated that what you actually received was only part of the salary and the other part was given to your wife.  Was that reflected in communication and tax documents with the tax authorities?    I am sorry Mr Pretorius, he has understood what I think you were asking and he has answered that question, but I think I would prefer that he answers directly in terms of the question I have put to him.  I put the question now in my own way.  Your salary as represented to the tax authorities, was it the salary that was being given to you, only that was represented to the tax authorities as your whole salary and maybe let me stop there.  What is the answer to that question?    As the whole salary?    Ja ...[intervenes].    Ja ...[intervenes].    Ja.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.  So in other words the part of your salary ...[intervenes].    That was paid to your wife, was it represented to the tax authorities as her salary instead of as part of your salary?    And that was factually not correct.     Thank you.     I am sorry again Mr Pretorius.  I do not know whether for completeness it is necessary to know what that salary was and how it was split.  Butyou might ...[intervenes].    Later on.  Okay.  All right.    Ja.    Okay.  All right.      The splitting of your salary was that done for your benefit as opposed to the benefit of the company?    For both of you.    Okay.  All right.  I guess that would be dealt with in due course.  Okay.     I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I was wondering where this R 27 million, where those figures are.  Is it – I am not good with figures, there is no indication anywhere that it is million.  Is it – I may be wrong.     Oh you know what Mr Pretorius what may have confused me is that in relation to the figures for the years before 2017.  The way the figures are written is that there is -00 for cents, whereas in this one there is no -00 for cents.  So that might have caused me some confusion.  Thank you.    Yes.  Some were paid ...[intervenes].    But not in full.    Before you do that Mr Pretorius just so that – for the sake of completeness if I may go back to the position of your wife.    Is my understanding correct that in Dyambu’s books, Bosasa’s books she was reflected, or would have been reflected as a BEE but she actually did not do any work is that correct?      Thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  It does not appear to me that it is apparent from pages 10 and 11 that with effect from 2005 she had fallen out of the picture ...[intervenes].   Yes.    Her name is there in the ...[intervenes].    That column.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well the difficulty with that Mr Pretorius is that also the column written annual earnings A Agrizzi is no longer there at page 11.    So there should be something that will tell the reader of the change.    I am sorry it should be paid to A Agrizzi in both columns at page 11 is that right?    Is that right.  Okay.  Thank you.      Then that will make it clear.     That is at what page Mr Pretorius?    With regard to the document at page 247, 248, the one that we have just had a look at.  You have said that you did not compile it and you do not know who compiled and you do not know if it is correct or accurate.  And I assume you are talking about not knowing whether it is accurate as of now.  As at the time that you left Bosasa do you know whether this is how – whether it reflects what the position was at time or not?    Thank you.    Yes, no that is fine.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we    Thank you.  We adjourn.COMMISSION RESUMES    Yes, Mr Pretorius?   Before you proceed, I just want to bring something to Mr Agrizzi’s attention, that is that at page 156 of EXHIBIT S1 in the bundle that we have been using this morning, I think that is a tax document, you are, your job title is reflected as Chief Operating Officer.  I think when I asked you a question, you said in your, in your business cards it was reflected as Marketing Coordinator or something.  Are you aware of what is reflected there?    Oh, okay.  Well, I may have but when you left, you were COO, it is Chief Operations Officer or Chief Operating Officer.  Is that correct?    Okay.  All right, thank you.  Yes, you may proceed, Mr Pretorius.    What did he tell you about arms deal, I did not hear that part?      Okay, thank you.    The shareholding that you have just given relates to when you were appointed right at the beginning?    Okay.    I am, I am sorry.  Was the point you were making that by the time you were asked to assist with regard to the tender submission that had not, that had some error ...[intervenes]    The company had already lost that tender.  Is that, is that what you mean or it had not lost the tender as yet?   It had not succeeded in the gaining the, getting the tender?    Okay.  All right.    It does, it does.  Thank you very much.    And in this case, at this stage, we are talking about this particular tender or was that something that was, that happened usually in the, in regard to tenders involving other Sasol or involving jumbo[?].  I just want to see whether we are just dealing with what you are saying, relates, and in so far as it may relate to Mr Mofokeng, whether you are just talking about this particular incident or whether you are saying there were many others which involved him.    Okay, okay.  Okay.     Ja, no ...[intervenes].    Yes.     Ja, ja.  Thank you, I understood your evidence in that way.      I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Maybe I missed this.  Mr Gavin Watson said to you, said there was a need for you to go and see Mr Mofokeng.  Is that right?    So the two of you were going to go and meet Mr Mofokeng.    Now, and you met him?    What I may have missed is what transpired at that meeting?    Now, was that, is that what Mr Mofokeng said, namely that you should not worry, or was that Mr Watson saying that?    So the, the purpose of the meeting as you, am I correct inunderstanding you to say the purpose of the meeting was to put pressure on Mr Mofokeng to put pressure on the company and that you had the meeting and the result of the meeting was that Mr Mofokeng said, ‘Do not worry’.    Thank you.    Do you know how he would have come to know that information?    Okay, thank you.    Okay, before you proceed.  Let me go back again one step.  Do you, did you ever come to know whether the pricing information that Mr Mofokeng gave you, was actually correct?    Okay.    Did you, did you get to know at any stage how…    Did you get to know at any stage how the error was discovered?  Didsomebody within Dyambu/Bosasa after the bid documents had been submitted go through them and discovered that there was an error or was this information namely that there was an error.  Did it come from within SASOL?    Thank you.      Was he now employed by Dyambu/Bosasa the person that you say previously worked for you at Molope?   Okay.      Molope.    You would approve.    How regular were these requests?  Was there like a pattern like once a month or once in six months, or only if there is a particular occasion?      Like monthly, more or less?      And in so far as Mr Simon Mofokeng is concerned how long did this continue, this orders, if you are able to say?    Oh okay, no, thank you.    The monetary value might have probably changed from one month too, form one order to another, but are you able to give some indications such as well maybe not less than so much, or between that amount and that amount on average?    Per month?    More or less a month, ja, per order.  Okay, thank you.    So if the orders were roughly monthly and at that time may be between 12 000 to R15 000 if I heard you correctly, so we may have, they may have annually been at least not less than R100 000 a year?    Thank you.     What was the work involved in this tender?      Well I must just say the witness just mentioned to you that it is a gentleman, I also thought it is women.  But some names among some Xhosa names that people from Kwa-Zulu Natal like me view as female or male names are the other way, or sometimes they apply to both, so maybe that is what happen to you with this one?     Yeah, okay, thank you.      Vulisango being V-U-L-I-S-A-N-G-O?    Ja, okay, thank you.    Okay he says, Mr Pretorius says you have just told me that Mr Gavin Watson asked you to pay those two people as I understand it, that is Mr Mapisa and?     Ja, he is then asking you what happened after he had asked you, that is Mr Watson, he had asked you to pay them?    Oh okay.     Okay.      In Dubai?    Well do you recall what gift or gifts were purchased for Mr Mapisa?     And Mr Manyatsi?    Okay, thank you.    Maybe before you get there, I hope I did not miss this.  Do you know whether or not these two persons from the Post Office had any influence in the tender being awarded to Bosasa?      Ja, but what I am asking is much more than that, not just what you think might be in terms of ...[intervenes]    Do you know any facts that they were part of the panel they were whatever.   Thank you.    I am sorry the reference to Correctional Services confuses me.  We were dealing with the Post Office and we are now going to deal with the Airports Company, and we were dealing with two person who occupied positions of authority in the Post Office, where does the Correctional Services come in?    Okay.      Ja.    Okay, thank you.    Is that at the OR Tambo Airport?    Thank you.  Correct.   Yes do so.    Okay.    Yes.     That he was responsible for the tender at OR Tambo, does that mean that he was basically the one who could decide who gets the tender or not?  Or your understanding.    Okay, thank you.    These bags would it be bags that any security company is likely to have or where they just peculiar to Bosasa?    Oh okay.  Okay thank you.      Yes.    Okay thank you.    the ‘for them’ in this sentence that you made is for, is it for Bosasa for Mr Gavin Watson when you started doing the payments for Bosasa to the individuals, is that what you mean?    I am sorry is that in respect of the Airports Company?    Yes okay.    What was the regularity of these payments in the context of the Airports Company?  Was it more or less monthly or was it at random or was it when the time for the extension of the contract was approaching or how, what was the regularity?    Now the two individuals that you have mentioned would they have received those monthly payments until you left Bosasa or until they left at the Airports Company as far as you know?    But during the time while they remained at the airports company the payments continued until they left?    That is what you say?    Okay, and the same principle applied to other individuals within Airports Company that were being paid as well?    Thank you.  Did you ...[intervenes]    I am sorry     I respect of these two individuals do you recall having known at anyone stage how much money was in the bag on a particular occasion for a particularone?  Or are you able to say that although the amounts might have differed from one month to another, if that is the case, generally it would not have been less then X amount or is that something that you are not able to say?    Yes, okay, no, thank you.    Yes no that is fine.  Let us also do this to the extent that you are able to help.  In respect of for example the, in respect of for example the two individuals Thanda and Mohema, let us say Thanda, do you have a clear recollection that at some stage or another you did actually pack the money for, that was going to her, is it a him or her?  Thanda?    Oh okay.  Do you have any recollection that in regard to Mr Thanda for example there definitely was a time when you packed the cash, you put it in the bag,and maybe even delivered it yourself to him?      Yes.  Well I am asking because earlier on you did say that at some stage you did the deliveries yourself, so I ma just checking in regard to whom that might have happened.  In regard to Mr Mohema did that happen?      You cannot recall.    Yes, okay.    No that is fine I just wanted to know whether you are able to specifics in that regard or whether you just remember in terms of generally that you did at some stage deliver to some individuals.    Ja, okay, thank you.    Yes, okay thank you, I am sure Mr Pretorius will deal with that in due course.    Thank you.  Well Mr Pretorius I think you said Mashir, you meantBashir.    Ja, thank you.    Before you do so Mr Pretorius.  Mr Agrizzi it seems that there would have been many occasions when these payments were made to certain individuals at the Airports Company when you were not the one who delivered the money and you were not in the company of the person who delivered the money.  So the delivery would have been done by somebody else or other people.      Are you able to tell me who would have been doing deliveries either generally or on some of the occasions.  Either at the beginning or it was the same people throughout up to the end?  Just give us, give me some information there.    Yes what I am saying is where there kind of standard people who use to do deliveries or not really?  There are people maybe Mr A, Mr B, or Ms C from Bosasa who were, who would normally be entrusted with delivering.  Or is thatsomething that you cannot remember?    Oh so in a way for each person there would be somebody that deals with that within Bosasa?    Okay, thank you.    And the money that would be, that people who came in would ask for would it be money for all manner of purposes in relation to the operations of the company and/or maybe bribes, or would it always only be bribes if they came in and ask for money?    Oh so in other words, whenever they came in and asked for money and Mr Gavin Watson went to, what you referred to as "Gavin's safe" you all knew this was for bribes?    Yes.    And the people who came to ask for money in that fashion were all – were SASSA personnel, is that correct?  Or would there be somebody from outside with SASSA who could also come in and make that request?    Okay, okay, okay.  So – but one of the points you are making is that whatever they may say when they come in they are going to – they need the money for – you all knew and probably they also knew that they knew what it was for?    Ja okay thank you.    And the money that was kept in what you refer to as 'Gavin's safe', was it only for this purpose, namely for bribes, or it was also used for other things?  Is that something you would not know?    Okay thank you.  And for the best part of the time during which you were employed at Bosasa, would it be correct to say that for all intense and purposesyou could be seen as Mr Gavin Watson's right-hand man?  I think you mentioned something like that earlier?    Would it be correct to take the position to be like that?    So therefore, if your knowledge was that money that was kept at what you call 'Gavin's safe', was solely used for bribery?  It is highly unlikely that it was used for anything else, or part of it was used for anything else, would that be correct?    Yes okay thank you.      And do you know what was used to make sure that money takenfrom Mr Watson's safe at the request of whatever director, reached the person for whom it was intended?  Was there any mechanism that was in place to ensure that, or was this done on the basis of trust for the person that requested the money that they would pass it onto the right person?    Okay thank you.    And that would have been from when to when that responsibility?  That responsibility was your responsibility from when to when if you are able toremember?    Okay.  You might be able to assist us tomorrow on that or not?    Okay.  So I just want to look at the period, is it five years or whatever, but you can tell us tomorrow, it is fine.      Are you still able to testify, you are still okay?   Okay alright.    Okay.    Alright no, I just wanted to make sure that you are still feeling free to be able to continue to testify for now.     Okay thank you.    If it was an old name, as it were, or an amount that you know normally goes to that person, you would approve it yourself without having to refer to Mr Watson?    Thank you.      When one has regard to all the codes that you may have used then.   Would this principle apply to all those codes, namely maybe the first two or three letters relate to the name of the recipient, the figure relates to the amount per month.  The last two or three letters relate to the person who must deliver the money to the recipient.  Was that the principle that applied more or less to all the codes?    Oh.    Okay.    Okay thank you.      Support for an organisation in this context meaning, will that person do what is necessary to get a tender for the company, is that what it meant?    Thank you.  And who would decide on the amount, is it Mr Gavin Watson as to who gets what?    From who?   That is now the?    No the person who must give support to the company?    The Director?    Okay, okay.   Ja.    But the ultimate decision-maker would be Mr Watson to take a ...[intervenes]?    Okay.    Do you know whether – before the internal person makes the motivation that a particular person, recipient – or future recipient be paid a certain amount?  Do you know whether that would have been discussed and agreed upon withthat person first, or it would vary, or you do not know?    Thank you.      Would you have a recollection of what you discovered when youstarted with this responsibility, what you discovered as being the amount more or less that the company was spending per month paying bribes?  It might have changed at some stage, but your first recollection of how much the company was spending in bribes per month in this way.  Are you able to enlighten me on that?    About this monthly cash.      Ja.      R4 to R6 million a month?    Okay.      But the only person who had access to the safe was only one person?    Mr Gavin Watson.   Yes.    Yes we may do that, but before we do that, can I ask this one question?    When you started with the responsibility of dealing with this cash and keeping records.    If you are able to recall, just tell me more or less what you think was the lowest amount that was going to a recipient, you know, out of all the recipients thatmay have been there, you might be aware that the lowest monthly amount may have been R10 000 or 30, and maybe what the highest was if you have some recollection, even if it is not actually exact figure, but more or less?    Yes.  And the highest would have been more or less?    To an individual.    Okay, okay thank you very much.      Thank you very much.  We are going to adjourn now.    And we will resume tomorrow morning at 10
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning.     DCJ        Thank you.    DCJ if we may start today by just informing the public generally of where the evidence leaders' plans stand for the moment, and to placethe intentions of the evidence leaders over the next few weeks and months into a particular context.  We will then deal with the preliminary matters relating to the witness to be called this morning.    So DCJ in the – Chair, in the first ...[intervenes].    I am sorry.    This is the first session of 2019 Chair, and it is perhaps apposite therefore to record the planning of the legal team for the first months at least of 2019.  As we said in the opening address of the legal team, which in fact remains a good reference source for understanding the context in which our evidence is given, we are governed by our terms of reference.  In general terms, term of reference 3.1 or term of reference 1.1 to 1.3 deal with appointments and dismissals of Ministers, State functionaries, office bearers and undue influence exercised in respect of these appointments and dismissals.The focus in particular is on the influence exercised by the Gupta family, but our terms of reference are not restricted to that.  These terms of reference Chair, deal with any form of undue influence, the words used are inducement for gain over Ministers, office bearers, officials and personnel of State owned entities.  They also deal with issues of governance.So the evidence to date has largely been focused on these issues, butthat evidence is not complete Chair, and there will be occasion during the next few weeks in particular, and perhaps even later than that where there will be further evidence in relation to those terms of reference which deal with appointments, dismissals of Government officials, Ministers and issues of governance, particularly at State owned entities.Term of reference 1.4 Chair, deals with the unlawful award of tenders to benefit the Gupta family or any other family, individual or corporate entity.  This evidence will be led in the coming months primarily under the rubric of the State owned entities.  State owned entities such as Eskom, Transnet, Denel, South African Airways, SABC and others.So Chair, the evidence that will be given will be given in tranches specific to particular State owned entities.  We will begin with Eskom in the coming weeks.  But that evidence will not be limited to State owned entities, and that will emerge when that evidence is led over the coming weeks and months.We have dealt also with term of reference 1.6, which deals with the award through irregularities, undue enrichment, corruption and undue influence of contracts, mining licenses, Government advertising in the New Age Newspaper and other Government services.  And we refer there for example to the evidence given concerning the Government Communication and Information Service and the New Age Newspaper, about which there has been extensive evidence and which has become the matter of some controversy and those issues will be dealt with, as well as the expanded issues, mining licenses and the like under term of reference 1.6.We have dealt comprehensively with term of reference 1.7 Chair, that is the closure of the Gupta bank accounts by the banks.  We have also dealt comprehensively with term of reference 1.8, that is the appointment without dueprocess of advisors to the then Minister Des van Rooyen.  We have dealt with the circumstances in which that took place.    No, we have dealt with substantially ...[intervenes].    As was stated in the opening address Chair, term of reference 1.5 and 1.9 deal with the nature and extent of the act of corruption.  Sohaving placed today in his historical context Chair, the focus of evidence in respect of 2019 is as follows, firstly to complete the categories of evidence to which I have just referred and that was led in 2018.Secondly to deal comprehensively with State Capture corruption and fraud in the various State owned entities and Government departments. Thirdly to deal at a level somewhat different from previous evidence with terms of reference 1.5 and 1.9, the nature and extent of corruption on the one hand in Schedule 2 entities, principally State owned entities and on the other hand National Government, Provincial Government and Municipal Government, and then to deal with remaining matters within our terms of reference.For the immediate future, however, that is the evidence that will be led in the first part of 2019, there are two topics or categories of evidence that bear mention.  You will recall Chair, that term of reference 1.4 talks of the unlawful award of tenders to benefit the Gupta family, but expressly mentioned in terms of reference 1.4 are references to other families, individuals or corporate entities, and theevidence of the next two weeks will focus here.Secondly Law Enforcement Agencies Chair, there will be evidence from and concerning law enforcement agencies to follow the next two weeks.  The view of the legal team is that central to the environment in which State Capture, corruption and fraud may take place and central to its detection and prosecution, and ultimately its prevention is the role and conduct of Law Enforcement Agencies, and a considerable tranche of evidence in the next two months will deal with these issues.Having said that Chair, it is perhaps convenient then to deal with the evidence that will be led today and in the days that follow.  Term of reference 1.1, if I    Yes.    So we will lead evidence Chair, over the next few days with your leave, that deals with the conduct of other family, individual or corporate entity as quoted there, doing business with Government or any organ of State.Then I have already referred to 1.5 and 1.9, the evidence to follow in the next few days will shed some light, if that evidence is accepted by you ultimately Chair, on the nature and extent of corruption both in relation to public entities and inrelation to State entities.So what is immediately apparent from the terms of reference Chair, is that our terms of reference contemplate an unlimited range of families, entities or individuals who could be authors or beneficiaries of State Capture, corruption or fraud. The witness about to take the stand is Angelo Agrizzi, a former employee of Bosasa as it was previously known.  He is what may be loosely termed a whistle-blower, and I do not intend to use that term Chair, in any definitive or statutory sense, specifically disavow such use of the term.  Mr Agrizzi or witnesses in positions similar to Mr Agrizzi, as a person who on his own version participated in or collaborated in unlawful acts of what arguably may constitute State Capture, corruption and fraud, and is now willing to disclose those unlawful acts and those of his colleagues.So it is particularly in that sense that the term whistle-blower perhaps loosely may be used but we prefer to look at the particular nature of this particularwitness's evidence.  He participated in an unlawful acts and is willing now to disclose them.So Mr Agrizzi will, with your leave Chair, testify to corporate and individual conduct over a period of many years, bordering on 20 years.  He will testify to conduct involving bribery, fraud, corruption, money laundering and arguably, even on his own version, State Capture.If I may refer to a very useful memorandum prepared by [no sound on    R110 000 per month.  Then Chair there are variousother references to audio recordings and in particular may I refer to paragraph 26 where reference is made to an audio recording of persons talking about Mr Agrizzi, where they indicate that they are prepared to cause him harm or have third parties cause him harm.  A person in one audio recording, purported to be a Mr Gumede, a director of Bosasa, and he can be heard telling people that Mr Agrizzi must watch his back because a prisoner could easily be released from Westville prison, kill someone and then be returned to the prison and have a solid alibi for the killing.  That evidence has been investigated and it will be before you.And then the investigators say, and this will obviously be tested by the investigation team, tested by yourself Chair, before you evaluate the evidence, but   Ah, yes Chair of course, and it is not – I must correct myself there and I have, from time to time been corrected, I might have a slightly different emphasis in relation to my own views but they must concede to the rules and to what you have just said.  There is no right to cross-examine.  It is a right to apply for leave to cross-examine under your direction Chair.So we ask that the witness be called, subject to the understanding that implicated parties will now be followed and that the – will now be informed and the procedures and the rules set in motion, and we ask that that evidence be given in open forum.    Yes, it is in fact his wish that that occur.    Yes Chair.    Implicated parties have the right, in terms of Rule 35, to do precisely what you have intimated Chair, and perhaps it is apposite not to make any final decision, only a provisional decision at this stage to allow the evidence to be heard, but any final decision in relation to prior notice once they have been heard,indeed.    Thank you Chair, as stated the name of the witness is Angelo Agrizzi.  His full names will be given to your Registrar to be sworn in.    Thank you Chair.  Chair, you have before you two bundles, they will be Exhibit S1 and S2.  If I may take you to the cover page of Bundle S1.    Yes Chair.    You will see volume 1 of 2 on it hopefully.    On the binder.    Chair, I will explain that to you in a moment but does it have beneath it volume 1 of 2?    Yes.    That is S1.   And the other one then will be S2.    If I may just explain Chair, to avoid any confusion, the reference to Bundle 01 is the reference to the first bundle which has been given to you Chair.  I have Bundle 02 and everybody else has bundles in sequence number.  That is so, it is a device being instituted by the investigators to ensure that every person who receives the bundle can be accountable for having received a particular file with particular documents in it, and that is why you have received Bundle 01, I have Bundle 02 and each person who receives a bundle has a particular numbered bundle.The reason for this has been to attempt to tighten up on the security within the Commission, and you will have noticed Chair that this is one of the rare occasions on which the press have not published a statement before the witnessgives evidence.  So it seems that the security measures that have been implemented have at least in this case been marginally successful.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.   And then Chair if I may just ask you by way of preliminaries, to turn to the second divider in Bundle S1, and you will see there a comprehensive index of several pages detailing and indexing the various annexures which will appear in the bundle.    On the last page of that index you will see that there are a number of exhibits.  You do not yet have in the bundles, the original exhibit.  Those will be shown or played in due course.  But the transcript of Exhibit 1, that is the video recording which will be played when we get there, has been handed to your Registrar, and you have it in a brown envelope.    Those are not obviously part of the paginated bundle.    Yes.  No, I understand that.    Chair, perhaps the exhibits should be numbered Exhibit S1, Exhibit S2 and following.    And we will amend that page accordingly.    And we will refer to them, I will trust I will remember and if not you will no doubt call me to order Chair but ...[intervenes].    Thank you Chair.    If I may then proceed Chair.    Thank you.  Mr Agrizzi, you have the bundles before you?    Good morning Mr Agrizzi.    Chair perhaps there is something else I should mention, because of the basis upon which the pages were numbered in the bundle, you will see for example page 1, the first page of the affidavit of Mr Agrizzi, AA001.  For all practical purposes I am not sure.  I do not understand these things always Chair, I do not know why the AA is there but it can be ignored.  We will refer just to the numbered pages, thank you.    Mr Agrizzi, the affidavit appears in the first bundle you have.    Yes, we are just going to refer to numbers not letters in relation to any page in the bundle.    Mr Agrizzi, the affidavit which has been placed in the bundle, appears at page 1 to 106.    Would you look at page 106 please.    Whose signature is that that appears under the – over the words Angelo Agrizzi?   Alright, and the initials on the individual pages, are those yours?    You apparently, from the information on page 106, attested to this affidavit yesterday.    Yes.  As far as you know, and subject to any correction that might be brought about in the affidavit, are the contents of this affidavit true and correct?   If we could go then to page 1 of your affidavit, I will ask you to deal with the matters as they appear in sequence in your affidavit, but in your own words alright.  I might from time to time, with the leave of the Chair, lead you.  You are a businessman and you live in Johannesburg?    And you were born in Germiston, Gauteng?    And you are a South African citizen?    Are you married with children?    You have heard, and it has already been clearly stated to the Chair, both by myself on behalf of the legal team and on affidavit that this statement incriminates you in respect of potentially serious offences.   Have you reported these acts as required by the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, particularly Section 34?    Has any influence or coercion exercised on you in relation to the giving of this evidence?    Have you been offered any incentive or reward for giving this evidence?    In paragraph 3 of your affidavit, and by way of introduction at this stage, we will deal with it in more detail later, you record that during your employment at Bosasa you were exposed to unlawful acts over a long period of time, would you just expand on that please?    Right.    And perhaps the microphone should be closer to you.  If you can manage that.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Agrizzi, given the period of timeover which you will record or attempt to recall and testify to, has it been possible for you to recall everything and I refer particularly in the time that you have taken to prepare this statement?    Right and so should cross-examination or questioning here or investigation give rise to any further channel of investigation or channel of questioning or provision of further evidence, are you willing to cooperate in providing that?    And if necessary your affidavit can be supplemented.    Alright.  Now, I recall you saying in answer to my question as to the period of your involvement with Bosasa, you mentioned the date09.  Is that correct?    Right and you terminated your employment when?    And it is in that period of almost 20 years that your involvement in these activities about what you are going to testify took place.    And it is in respect of that period of time that you say,you could not possibly remember each and every incident.    That might be relevant to the commission’s work.    So it follows from that that there is probably a need for on-going interaction and you are willing to participate in that.    And then in paragraph 4, against by way of introduction and we will deal with it later, you give some explanation of why you have decided to cooperate with firstly the commission and secondly law enforcement agencies.  You tell the Chair briefly and by way of introduction of the background to your decision.  Perhaps not the background at this stage, to you decision, but why you have made this decision.    It will be put to you from time to time during your evidence and no doubt it will be put to you in cross-examination in due course, why you took so long to come forward.    Briefly, the answer to that question.    Alright.  At paragraph 6 Mr…  We will return to these issues during the course of your evidence, but for the moment, can we move on then to paragraph 6 of your statement.  You schooled in Germiston and you matriculated in 1985.  Is that correct?    And you were employed part time during your school years to fund your studies.    Your training at Wits Hotel School, when did that occur?    Right and did you continue with these studies?   What did you then do?    Well, just carry on from 1989 then.    Would you just pause there for a moment.  We will continue in due course with your employment history and particularly how you became involved with catering at [Indistinct] institutions, but if I may interrupt you, my apologies.  Chair, I have had a request from the technical team to adjourn for 10 minutes to deal with some technical issues.  I am not sure what they are, but that is the request and it is also the time for the short adjournment.   Thank you Chair.  The technical issues which I mentioned before the adjournment have been apparently been resolved.  They related to the public broadcaster proceedings.     They are being monitored and if they arise again, youwill be informed.    No, I believe that the “technical issue” arose at the time Mr Agrizzi started giving his evidence.    The recording and the transcription is in order.  It is merely the public feed.  Oh okay.      But it is in order and has been resolved.   Given that the matters’ are introductory only and given that the feed was not entirely interrupted but only partially ...[intervenes]    Perhaps that can be checked and once it has been checked we can decide what to do at a later stage.    Thank you.  Mr Agrizzi, you had said to the Chair that in 1997 you applied for a position at Grantham Integrated Foods Services and you were stationed at Oryx Mine.  You gave that evidence.    And how long were you there for.    And after that, where did you go?    And in 1998 your statement continues.  In relation to your employment, what happened?    And did your wife work with you?    In what capacity?    Did Grantham Integrated Food Service then become Molope Foods.    Was it absorbed into Molope Foods?    When employed by Molope Foods then were you tasked with the oversight of a catering contract at the Scott Hostel in Klerksdorp.   Who did you work with there?    And did he give you certain information?    What was that information?    And did you become aware of the fact that Dyambu hadan interest in contracting other mine hostels?    What happened then in early 1999 in relation to your relationship with – or your potential relationship at that stage with Dyambu and Mr Gavin Watson?    Did you follow up?    What was the relevance of BEE credentials to you?    Did you then speak to Gavin Watson?    And did you meet with Danny Mansell?    So he was managing director.  Of what entity was he managing director?    You say you met with Danny Mansell.    At that stage in your work experience, did you have some experience of and skills in the submission of tenders?    And that was in your previous employment with Grantham and Molope.  Is that correct?    So you pointed out then to Mansell that their tendering processes were not, to coin a phrase, up to scratch and you intimated to Mansell that you could recommend improvement.    Did that result in any contact being made with you?    And can you recall approximately when that was?    Alright.  So did you attend a meeting with Gavin Watson at that time?    And what occurred at that meeting?    What happened then?    Were any concerns raised by Mansell at that stage about your employment?    We will talk a little about his involvement in a few minutes, but at that meeting where your evidence is that you received confirmation ofyour appointment or you were appointed, did something happen after that?  Immediately after that?    It seems somewhat odd ...[intervenes]    Sure.    It seems rather odd that a businessman such as Gavin Watson would immediately seek to employ you at a meeting without checking, without looking at your background.  Of course, he might have.  It seems odd the circumstances in which you were employed.  Do you have any explanation for what occurred?    After the introductions to other employees in Dyambu, did anything else occur between yourself and Mr Watson and that is Mr Gavin Watson.    I will do Chair.  My apologies.  We are paragraph 6.16 of your statements.  6.16.  You told the Chair that there was an agreement to your knowledge to be signed the following day.  The parties to this agreement would be Molope on the one hand and who on the other?    And you told Gavin Watson about that?    What was Gavin Watson’s response?    Alright.  Firstly who is Dr Jurgen Smith or who was he?    Yes I see ‘he was.’  He is now deceased I understand.   Would you do so please?    And to your knowledge did Unions participate in the process of appointment?  Selection and appointment of caterers?    Right, you said that we were going to meet them.  Who is the ‘we’ and who is the ‘them’?    And who is Mr Patrick Maine or who was he at the time?    In paragraph 6.17, you give further detail in relation to the context of this particular contract.  Would you explain that to the Chair please?    Right.  Now you obviously, as is apparent from the following paragraphs, made a decision in relation to your employment at Molope and the offer of employment given to you from Mr Gavin Watson.  What was going through your mind at the time?  What decision did you make and why?    Right.  You understand now and perhaps this question should be put to you a little later that you were going to leave the potential contract holder where you had no doubt been influential in obtaining that contract or the prospect of that contract, go to an opponent of Molope Foods and assist them toundermine or to lose that contract or to obtain the contract and your former employer to lose that contract.    Right, what did you do then on the 7 May 1998?  We are at paragraph 6.18 of your statement.    His name occurs later in your statement.    Right, so when did you start employment with Dyambu?  On what date?    Right, did you then as foreshadowed in paragraph 6.16 of your statement visit Leeudoring Mine?   And is that the Mine at which this contract was about to be signed between Molope and Goldfields.    Alright.    Did you accompany Dr Jurgen Smit to Leeudoring Mine?    Did you then deal with the issue at hand and that is the eminent signature of the agreement between Goldfields and Molope.    Would you look at paragraph 6.19 of your statement.  You say there, ‘I accompanied Dr Jurgen Smit to Leeudoring Mine and convinced them not to sign the agreement with Molope.    So you did.   Oh I see.  So, you did deal with the issue and you took steps to persuade the personnel at Leeudoring Goldfields Mine not to sign the agreement.    Let us move then to paragraph 6.20 of your statement Mr Agrizzi.    Your initial position when you were employed by Dyambu, I presume it is, was in a marketing position.    Right and what was your relationship with Mr Gavin Watson from the time you were employed?    Let us just go back please to paragraph 6.18.  That date there, 7 May 1998 where you say you proceeded to the office at Molope and resigned.  Is that date correct?    Alright, because later on you say you started your employment with Dyambu on 10 May 1999.    So which is correct?  1998 or 1999.  I am not sure it makes huge amount of difference.    1999.    And if you go back to paragraph 6.14, should that date also then be 1999?    Okay, so those two amendments should be made to your statement.   6.14.    And then if you look at paragraph 6.20, you say in the first sentence of that paragraph, ‘Initially I was employed by Bosasa in a marketing position.’  Bosasa is in fact the name of the company that was introduced after the name Dyambu was scrapped.    Through a corporate restructure.   So that should actually read  Dyambu.  Is that not right?    So that is another correction we should make in paragraph 6.20.  In any event, you were telling the Chair about your relationship with Gavin Watson.  Did he tell you anything about his arrangements or conduct with members of Unions at Mines.      Let us take it step by step.  You were – say you were present at meetings.  Where did these meetings take place?    Right and where were those offices?    Where?    And you say you were present at meeting where Mr Mafeka and Mr Gavin Watson were also present.    What did you actually see at these meetings?    When you say getting money, did you see the cash or was it a bag or a parcel?  What was it?    And how do you know that money was in the bag?    Alright, we will talk about that later on then.  In October and November 1999, did Dyambu’s contractual relationship with Kloof and LibanonMines improve.    Did it want approved, were contracts entered into ...[intervenes]    Not that particular one.  There will be further evidence of the practice in relationship to delivery of cash.     How that was done.    And how the cash was packed and handed over.    In other cases and there will be evidence of a practice in that regard, which may shed light on the witnesses evidence in relation to this incident but no particular evidence in relation to this particular meeting is envisaged.    What happened then in October/November 1999 as you state in paragraph 6.22?    And your position within what was now called Bosasa, during the next year, did that change?   Did your responsibilities change?   And in relation to the new Bosasa brand, did you have any responsibilities?    So just by way of summary, on your initial employment by what was then Dyambu, you were employed in a marketing position as you say in paragraph 6.20.    You say that within a year your responsibilities have broadened ...[intervenes]    And you were responsible for operations amongst other things.    And what was your position within that year in relation to the management and submission of tenders?    Now, in paragraph 6.25, you speak about prayer meetings and I am not going to prevent you from giving this evidence, but perhaps you should tell the Chair why you were referring to these practices at Bosasa?    Were there all night prayer meetings in addition?    In particular what did this indicate to you ...[intervenes]    Say what you wish to say about that and then I will ask you a question about this evidence.    Alright.  That answers the question I was about to askyou in relation to Gavin Watson’s strength as a leader and his degree of influence over his employees, but you have answered that question.  I want to deal briefly merely to introduce the document with the information contained in ANNEXURE A to your statement and that appears at page 107 of BUNDLE S1.  If you could go to page 108 please.  There is a diagram there that we may have to refer to in summary but not at this stage which shows various entities in the left hand column on the one hand and various other entities in persons on the right hand side but if I may refer you to page 109.    There we see various individuals.  Are these people thatyou will mention in evidence from time to time and are these the positions they held?    Alright, we may have to provide more detail to you in this diagram on page 109 to show the period for which these positions were held and then if we could go to page 110, there are the names of various officials under the heading of  Correctional Services.  Again some or all of these persons will be mentioned from the Department of Correctional Services and the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.   Do I understand correctly?    Again, we may have to redo this schedule to show the period and the Offices held by the various people you will mention in your evidence.    And similarly on page 110, there are the various members of the Watson family and on page 112 other individuals who are mentioned inyour statement and the Offices that they held.    Page 113, again Officials in the NPA and yes, the NPA and other law enforcement institutes.    Page 113 and so on.  Chair, the purpose of that document is simply as an index so that anyone reading the statement can make reference when a name is read to the position held either within the Bosasa Group of Companies or within officialdom on the other hand.    And it needs some revision before a final version is put up.    Just to fast forward, because we dealing at the moment principally with your employment history.  What actually occurred during the course of your employment, we will deal with in much more detail and in due course, but what happened in August 2016?    Paragraph 6.27.    The purpose of introducing that at this stage is merely to introduce two agreements that were entered into that appear as ANNEXURE B and ANNEXURE C.  Now the circumstances in which these agreements were concluded and the relevant facts in that regard will be dealt with in detail at the end of your evidence, but for the moment, would you tell the Chair, what is ANNEXURE B and what is ANNEXURE C.  The two agreements you refer to in paragraph 6.28 and 6.29.      Before you go on, Consilium Business Consultants (Pty)Ltd, was that  a company which was part of the Bosasa Group of Companies?    Yes.  Why was this agreement entered into?    Did you enter into that agreement?    After your resignation on 25 August 2016?    You will give evidence in due course about why you resigned in August 2016.  That is detailed evidence and we need to deal with it in its proper context and chronology but what persuaded you, having resigned to enter into this agreement, called the Settlement Agreement?    And then what is ANNEXURE C?  We are dealing now with paragraph 6.29.    So do I understand you correctly, the agreement which provided for your re-employment after your resignation with Bosasa for a period ofyears was superseded by another agreement.    Which replaced it.    So you say the financial benefit of the second agreement was substantially less than the financial benefits of the first agreement.    Yes, we will deal with it in more detail in due course and in its proper context, but your status having entered into the second agreement was, as I understand it, you had resigned and that resignation was confirmed?    And you had resigned your employment.   Alright.  In paragraph 6.30, you deal with the income and other benefits received from your employment at Bosasa and Dyambu during the period 1999 to 2016.    Let us just clarify that Mr Agrizzi.  Did that agreementcontinue in operation?    The second agreement.  The consultancy agreement.    And you will give evidence as to the circumstances in relation to that in due course.    Paragraph 6.30 deals with the income and other benefits received by you during the course of your employment at Bosasa for the period 1999 to 16 and you attached documents which appear to confirm this as ANNEXURE D1 to ANNEXURE D22.  Before we go into the tables which appear further on in your statement would you just explain to the Chair what you wish to in paragraph 6.30.1 and following.    No.  In paragraph 6.30.1 you qualified or explained the tables which follows.    And you raise certain facts which are relevant to the table which follow.    Would you just put those before the Chair please?  You can refer to paragraph 6.30.1 and following.    And she lost the income from employment.    But let us look at paragraph 6.30.1 for a moment.  You said my salary between the period 1999 to 2004 was partly in my name and partly in that of my wife’s.  Is that how your income and your salary was represented to the tax authorities?    How was – how do you explain that then?    You say that your salary.   In other words the salary due to you.    In terms of your contract of employment was split, partly in your name and partly in that of your wife’s.    So your wife was represented as receiving your salary.    Part of your salary and that I am asking, was that representation made to the Revenue Services for example.   And that was not a correct or even a false representation.    You say it was not false.    Explain that please.    So by representing that your salary ...[intervenes]    And you say that this was done in order to obtain tax advantages for tax purposes your own words?    And of course it does not take a tax expert to conclude that by splitting the salary you would be taxed at lower rates.  Both you and your wife than a lower rate than if you had been taxed ...[intervenes].    On your own is that correct?    Okay.  Let us move on then to the period 2004 to 16.  How was your salary paid then?    That information will appear in the annexures.    That we are dealing with ransom sense.    In a minute.    Just explain what happened with your salary during 04, and until 2016 please?    In addition to your income in terms of your contract ofemployment as you have described.  Did you receive other benefits of a monetary value?    What were these?    All right.  We will come to the detail in due course.  In relation to these benefits including cash payments did you declare these on your income tax returns?   Could you look at page 10 of the bundle, bundle S1, now there is a table there.  Would you explain that table to the Chair please?    So in answer to the Chair’s earlier question as to the details of the split between yourself and your wife, one can see those figures in the table on page 10?    So for example during 1999 you are recorded as having earned R 187 thousand, and your wife that is D Agrizzi I presume?    Is represented as having received R 400 thousand.   Well the implications are that your wife was represented as having earned substantially more.  In fact, more than double what you earn.     When the cause of that income was your employment?    Then the column that here is headed additional benefit and value your estimates?    My estimates, my meaning is [indistinct].  Those are approximate values of those benefits, holidays, house paint or [indistinct].     And these cash payments received are separate cash payments from all the other benefits in the table am I correct?     Then if you go to page 11 the table continues to 2010 and the benefits include assistance vehicle trade in what is that?    And the reference to the second and Audi Q7 was that a direct benefit?   And then on page 12 the table continues to 2017.    And in 2017 the table records payments under the head annual earnings paid by the Bosasa of R27 million am I correct?      And ...[intervenes].    Why, clarify please.  That figure in the table on page 12 under the heading annual earnings paid by Bosasa in 2017 what is that figure?    And what is the figure?  I am sorry Chair.    And in the next column additional benefits and value your estimates?    Now were those amounts actually paid to you and received by you?    So to be consistent with the way in which the figures are portrayed here in this table.  The figure R 27 391 651.00 should have after it a hyphen and two noughts.    But you say these amounts were not paid at least in full and  ...[intervenes].    Were not paid at all?    And the details we deal with in due course.    The circumstances which arose at the time to cause the non payment that you are referring to, the extent of non payment that you refer to.   Ja, let us just having dealt with that schedule of income, deal with the structure of companies and briefly with the history of Bosasa again by a way of background.  We do deal with certain factual matters in this section but that is the way your statement has been compiled ...[intervenes].    You will see we may just noted that the references to annual earning D Agrizzi stopped in 2004.   Let us deal then with the – and why did that occur if you just explain again and you have mentioned it briefly?    All right.  Let us go then to paragraph 7?    If I may explain, Chair.    If one looks at paragraph 10 or page 10 rather you will see ...[intervenes].    The headings to the ...[intervenes].    Columns.    Annual earning A Agrizzi, annual earning D Agrizzi.    That is the wife of Angelo Agrizzi.  You will see that a figure is in the column headed D Agrizzi until the year 2004.    If you turn the page, you will see that the columnheaded annual earning D Agrizzi has now disappeared.  And it is now headed annual earning paid by Bosasa and annual earning paid by Consilium.  I presume those amounts were paid directly to yourself?    Yes.  All right.  So let us correct that ...[intervenes].    Yes, okay.  Let us just correct that then.  The headingto the column on page 11, annual earning paid by Bosasa.    That should be A Agrizzi.    And in the next column annual earning paid by Consilium as you say in your statement should also be reflected as in paid in the name of A Agrizzi am I correct?      Okay.  Will that clear it up, Chair?    Correct, Chair.    And ...[intervenes].   And if you look at paragraph 6.30.2 the position after 04 is described there.  Do you see that?    All right.  Let us then move to paragraph 7.  The company that is relevant to your evidence that preceded the company Dyambu Operations Pty Ltd, and I must confess, Chair, I am not too sure of the manner in which the corporate change took place whether it was simply a change of names or a transfer of shares.  But prior to the Dyambu Operations Pty Ltd what was the name of the company relevant to the Bosasa Group as it became [indistinct]?   Who were the shareholders in that company?    And what was the business of Meritum?    All right.  Just before you go on please because Youth Development Centres and Lindela are going to feature prominently in the evidence that you are about to give.  What is a Youth Development Centre?    [Indistinct] what does it do?    And what is the purpose of Lindela, what is its function?      All right.  Did Meritum also provide catering services atmines?    And the corporate change that took place is explained in the last sentence of paragraph 7.1 where you say I was informed by Gavin Watson that the shares in Meritum Hostels (Pty) Ltd were sold to himself that is Gavin Watson, Mansell and Dyambu Holdings (Pty) Limited.      And the business was then conducted by and under the auspices of Dyambu Operations Pty Ltd?    If you look at ANNEXURE E1 to E2, and we need not go there for the moment it is there for reference purposes, Chair.  The structure of the Bosasa group of companies, it is affiliates and associate companies as it appeared in 2016 the time you left Bosasa is attached in ANNEXURE E1 and E2, am I correct?     During the course of your evidence you will refer to a number of companies you will refer also to trusts.      The position in what you have you referred to as the Bosasa Group of Companies in your evidence will be explained in those annexures.  And if necessary we can go there when that evidence is given.    All right.  Did you compile that document?    Can you – are you in a position to verify that the information there is absolutely correct?    So it is at best a guide for us is it?    Okay.    E1 is at page, sorry, page 247.  And the further documents follow.  So let us perhaps look at page 247.  The Bosasa Group structure appears on page 248 do you see that?    And the company in the top left hand corner of page 248 of ANNEXURE S, or schedule S1 or EXHIBIT S1 rather, is BosasaEmpowerment and Management Services (Pty) Ltd.    Its shareholders and directors according to the drafter of this document are set out there in that box at the top left hand corner.  And a subsidiary which is a 100 percent owned by Bosasa Empowerment and Management Services (Pty) Ltd is Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd.      And its directors are set out there and it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bosasa Empowerment and Management Services is that so?    And there are various related companies that appear on that page and following pages.    We refer in this statement or you refer in this statement to, on the one hand the Bosasa group of companies reflected in that annexure, and also to Bosasa.  When you refer to Bosasa to which company are you referring?    Bosasa Operations?    And that was your employer I understand?    Mostly.  Consilium was your employer at a stage as well?    All right.  From the Annexure and your own knowledge it seems safe at least to say that the parent company was Bosasa Empowerment andManagement Services (Pty) Ltd?    And within that structure various other companies operated as part of the Bosasa group of companies?    Was the position constant, and were there structures of the various companies and their relationship with one another, constant throughout the period of your employment with Bosasa?    Did shareholders change?    All right.  You are going to refer in your evidence then to a number of companies.  The first is Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd to which you have referred as your employer.    Does that now have a different name?    Right.  You will also refer the security arm of the group and I understand to Bosasa Security (Pty) Ltd correct?    Has that name changed?    Then in relation to Youth Development was there aseparate corporate entity?    What was the name of that entity?  Or what is the name of that entity?    All right.  In 7.2.4 you refer to Leading Prospect Trading 111 (Pty) Ltd.    What was the function of that company?    Who owned the Lindela facility?  Or who owns the ...[intervenes].    Lindela Facility ...[intervenes].    Right.  But you say the operations are managed and the contract is held by Leading Prospect Trading?    All right.  Then in paragraph 7.2.5 you refer to a company to which you will again refer in your evidence Sondolo IT (Pty) Ltd?    Is that now Global Technology Systems (Pty) Ltd also known as GTS?    Yes, what company is that and what did it do?    Okay.      Right.  And would you tell the Chair of a Phezulu Fencing (Pty) Ltd please?    That company does not appear on the organogram Ibelieve?    But it is a company related to or within the Bosasa group of companies am I correct?  3    And then Consilium Business Consultants (Pty) Ltd tell the Chair about that please?    Now you are going to refer to a number of entities in your evidence are you able at this stage to recall the full particulars and details of all these entities?    But to the extent that you can, you will assist the Commissioner?    Right.  But the person with the responsibility for constructing the companies and the relationship with one another I believe was the company secretary at Bosasa Mr Tony Perry?    And he could assist I presume in any explanation that is required?   All right.  Chair, I see it is 13   Thank you, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.      Thank you, Chair.  When we adjourned, Mr Agrizzi, we were at paragraph 7.4 of your affidavit and we mentioned the name of the CompanySecretary responsible for the structuring of the company is Tony Perry.    Or perhaps better put, responsible for the implementation of decisions concerning the restructuring of the company or the structuring of the company.     Right.  Now, you say in paragraph 7.5 that from time to time you received reports regarding the names of various people involved within the Bosasa Group of Companies and various people in Government with whom the Bosasa Group of Companies would have dealt and you mentioned there the namesin paragraph 7.5 of Gavin Watson and Ciopella[?].  Firstly, who is Mr Ciopella?      All right.  Firstly, did these two people mention to you the names of people who were shareholders in the various companies in the Bosasa Group of Companies?     I presume you can remember some names?    But not all?    Can you remember precisely the context in which the names were mentioned?  In other words whether were they shareholders or associates or any other detail?    All right.  My, my concern at this stage, before you mention names, is to [soundtrack interruption] the evidence that you would give is reliable and accurate.  Can you vouch for any names in relation to what you were told as regard shareholdings or directorships within the Bosasa Group of Companies?     Yes, I am, I am asking you whether, if you mention any names of those persons related to by Watson and Ciopella, whether that is reliable information which you are happy to present to the commission?    Well, those, those, that will be up to the investigatorsto produce.    You do not have those documents at hand now?    But apart from what appears in official documents, what you would have been told would have been hearsay evidence for which you cannot vouch.    And you are not, as I understand it, clear on your recall of exactly what was told to you?   So for that reason, I am not going to ask you to put up any names of shareholders and directors in the Bosasa Group of Companies, but if necessary and if it becomes relevant later, you are happy to do so, to the best of your ability?    Perhaps what you could do, is give it some thought overnight and record what you are happy is reliable information.    All right.  In paragraph 7.6 you talk about Meritum Hostels changing its name to Dyambu Operations.  We have heard that evidence.      In paragraph 7.7 you go on to talk about Gavin Watson’s involvement in the day-to-day running of the company, as you put it.  Couldyou tell the Chair what the position was in that regard?     In paragraph 7.7 you say, initially Gavin was not actively involved in the day-to-day running of the company.  What company are youreferring to there?    Do you recall who the shareholders were of Dyambu Operations at the time you were employed?    When did the name of Dyambu Operations change?  And I believe from your evidence it changed to Bosasa Operations (Pty) Ltd.    The contracts that you refer to, can you specify them?    And from 2001, December, where was the head office of the Bosasa Group of Companies located?    That is near Krugersdorp?    What was the relationship or the quality of the relationship rather, between Mansell and Watson?    And did that result in a transfer of shares?    What was that transfer?    Sorry, before you go on.  Sold, sold his shares to whom?    Right.  And you say those shares would…?    What…  Do you know or understand the purpose of that?    Allocation of shares.    What was the ...[intervenes].    In what fashion or in what manner or for what purpose?    Did Mansell ever return?    To the Bosasa fold?    In what capacity?    We will talk later of Mansell, Danny Mansell and your dealings with him.      During the first four years of your employment at theBosasa, what was the main business of Bosasa or Dyambu?    All right.  Before you go on, what is a full facilities management service contract?    Right.  And what did catering services involve at that time?    Would that involve purchasing the food stuffs?    Preparing and presenting?    You refer here to Lindele and you have told the Chair what that was all about and then you talk about Youth Centres of the Department of Social Services.  Are those the Youth Development Centres that you referred toearlier in your evidence or are they something different?     The services to the Youth Centres as referred to in this paragraph, is that the same thing, or is that something different?     You use a phrase here, ‘Youth Centres’ as opposed to Youth Development Centres.  Simple question, is that the same thing?   Okay.  Then you say in paragraph 8.2 that during the period 2001 to 2003, Bosasa entered into a number of agreements with, you say amongst other, the following entities.  Would you relate that please to the Chair?    Sorry, was that full facilities and catering?    Yes?    All right.  In relation to the agreement with the South African Post Office to provide security, where was this security to be provided?  Nationally, locally, at the head offices, where?    All right.  And by locally do you mean at post offices in the Johannesburg area, or what do you mean?    At individual Post Offices?    All right.  You have already testified to the activities of Gavin Watson in relation to trade union members in paragraph 9.1.      In paragraph 9.2, you say that during late 1999, you were instructed by Gavin Watson to attend to the Sasol catering tender?    Could you tell the Chair about that, please?    Who had submitted proposals?    Just before you go on; at what stage in the tenderprocess was the error discovered and at what stage in the tender process was the problem, as you say, rectified or intended to be rectified?    So, as we all know, it would be improper to change the tender specifications or the specifications in the bid and the costing at that stage.    Yes, okay.  Carry on please.    Well, let us clarify.  When a invitation to bid is issued, a company wishing to tender responds by providing the documentation, costing and other particulars required in the invitation to bid.  Is that correct?    At a later stage then the process is closed.    There is a deadline put and after that, as I understand the process, no amendments can be made to the bid documents.    Right.  Now as I understand it, at the stage you were asked to intervene, no-one had been awarded the tender yet.      But you had been alerted to the fact that there were errors in your tender documents?     Or your bid documents.    Right, and so after the closure of the tender process, but before the award of the bid to any particular bidder, you were intending to intervene ...[intervenes].    Which you say is not proper.    Okay.  Does that clarify it, Chair?    Thank you.  Proceed then.    In order to – as you have said to the Chair, this happened after the submission date of the tender.  In other words after tenders had closed.    In order to affect the amendments to your bid documents, did you then interact with officials at Sasol, at Sasol?    Right.  And do you know if that procurement official, or did that procurement official say anything to you about whether she had been instructed or not to intervene?    Do you know who that higher authority was?    You then, in paragraph 9.3 of your affidavit, talk of a meeting with a Mr Simon Mofokeng.  Who is or was Simon Mofokeng?    I think it is Wood and Allied Workers Union, is it?     And how did this meeting come about?   And did he explain to you the purpose of the meeting?     And how would that be achieved?    And putting pressure on the Union to do what?    So is your evidence then that Simon Mofokeng would be approached by Bosasa and in particular Gavin Watson and yourself to arrange that the Trade Union put pressure on the company, Sasol, in order to achieve theresult of obtaining a tender for Bosasa [indistinct] for Bosasa ?    All right.    So, let us just clarify; in paragraph 9.1, you talk about a particular catering tender at Sasol.    You say the interaction with Mr Mofokeng, did not have anything to do with that tender.  Am I correct?    So the tender you are talking about in paragraph 9.2 did in fact relate to what you say in paragraph 9.3 about Simon Mofokeng.    Thank you.  I understand.  My apologies, maybe my late night contributed to this.    Did Simon Mofokeng assist Gavin Watson and Bosasa in any other manner?    You say in your affidavit in paragraph 9.3 that Simon Mofokeng also gave information regarding Sasol pricing.  You have also mentioned pricing now.  What happened there?    That is understandable because it would be entirely improper to do so.    And you say that what Mofokeng did, was actually give you that information to allow you to adjust your price?    Entirely improper, I understand.    Yes.      Was there any other relationship between Simon Mofokeng or anyone related to Mofokeng and Dyambu as it was then?    And that was against the background of you receiving information that there were problems with your tender?    So you say in paragraph 9.4 that Dyambu Operations (Pty) Ltd was awarded the tender, that is the Sasol tender.    And you then say at this time Sasol agreed to changed the name of the bidder, Dyambu Operations, to Bosasa ?    The bidder and successful tenderer [sic]?    And that occurred, did it?    Right.    Need to change the name of the bidder Dyambu Operations to Bosasa?    The better and successful tenderer?    And that occurred did it?    After Dyambu had been awarded the tender did you receive any instructions form Gavin Watson?      What were those instructions?    Alright how was this implemented?  How was this arrangement implemented?  Who arranged for the implementation of this arrangement?   Alright.      So he moved from who?    From Molope?    To your company Dyambu Resolutions?    And he was subordinate to you, in other words, he reported to you did he?    And Gavin Watson gave the instructions to you and you, in turn, instructed Mantata?    Alright, so you say that Mantata would come to youroffice with a request or order, would this specify good?  What would it specify?  The order?    What would you do then when you received this order or request?      By ‘sign it off’ what do you mean?    Right so your approval would be permission to continue to execute the order?    Right and how was this allocated in the books of the company Dyambu/Bosasa?    Right.    That evidence is still to come.    So Mantata then comes to you with an order request, it is approved by you, by your signature, it is allocated for marketing or operational expenses, what is the practice in relation to how this matter is carried forward?  What would Sidney Mantata then do?    Alright, you say from time to time you would be told by Simon Mofokeng that he obviously received the good because he thanked you?    Did he always thank you, or did he ever complaining?    Where there times when Gavin Watson did not receive a delivery?    Sorry was there any time when Gavin Watson complained to you that a delivery had not been received by Mofokeng?  My apologies.      Who managed the Sasol contract?    Do you know whether they held any knowledge of this arrangement?     That is the arrangement with Simon Mofokeng?    Alright, in fact, you say in paragraph 9.5.6 on page 19 that each order was approximately R15 000 in value?    What happened then with this contract?  For how long did Bosasa hold the contract and how did the contractual relationship between Sasol on the one hand at Bosasa terminate?    To whom was this particular contract transferred?      Alright and did anything happen after the sale of the contract?    Let us move on to your evidence in relation to the South African Post Office.  In paragraph 10.1 you refer to a tender being awarded to Bosasa Security Pty (ltd).    When was the tender awarded?    Yes.    Well you can check paragraph 10.1.    Check paragraph 10.1 of the affidavit.    Because you have to give your evidence.     You will understand that although your affidavit forms part of the records of the Commission the evidence still has to be given orally.    Who was responsible for the submission of this tender?    Did anything happen before the tender was awarded at the hands of Gavin Watson?    Right, the contract that was ultimately awarded and entered into for what period was that?      in relation to the award of this tender did Gavin Watson mention any names to you?      What, who were, what were the names mentioned?   The first person mentioned is that the person referred to in paragraph 10.2.1 of your affidavit?    What was her position at the time?      His position.    And Mr Manyatsi?    Thank you Chair for relieving me. Of the burden of that error.      Did Sivhewe Mapisa hold shares in any company to your knowledge?      Right.    Now the evidence that you are about to give is at least partially corroborated by your own observations related in paragraph 10.5.  In paragraph 10.4 you say that Gavin Watson gave you certain information about the two persons you have just mentioned.  What was that information?      Information sorry.   What happened subsequent to that in relation to that communication by Gavin Watson?    Manyatsi    Sorry I must just correct Chair.  I think the evidence indeed was that Gavin Watson told Mr Agrizzi that he Gavin Watson was paying Mapisa and Manyatsi.    That is correct is it?    Now what happened after that?  Let me refer you to paragraph 10.5 and your trip to Dubai.      When you say ‘we’ who?    After this did Gavin Watson tell you the fate of these gifts?  To whom he had given them or what he done with them?      Right did Mr Mapisa enjoy any other benefits at the hands of Bosasa?    Alright but we must understand that at the time Mr Mapisa was a co-shareholder in a company with Valance Watson?    Can we deal then with the Airports Company of South Africa at page 21 of your affidavit?    Can we go on then please to deal with the Airports Company of South Africa.  But before we go on the Chair has raised an important point because you talk in your evidence about payments.  I am afraid nodding will not be picked up on the transcript so you should say yes or no as the case may be.     But you have given evidence as to the payments to various persons who exercised positions of authority and perhaps influence in relation to the business of the entity.      You have also given evidence in relation to contracts awarded or tenders awarded to Bosasa and the sometimes improper circumstances in which they were awarded, but what the chair had asked you is, is there any link between the payment and the award of the contract, or any direct instruction or exercise of influence that you personally know off.  I understand your answer to be you have assumed that from the circumstances.      Okay, now there will be other evidence which would tend to create that link but we will deal with that in due course.    But for the moment we also know that the special investigations unit did a full investigation in relation to the affairs of Bosasa.    The results of that investigation were passed on to the National Prosecuting Authority.    In relation to the particular contract, the circumstances inwhich they were entered into and the tender process proceeding the award of the contract that information is contained in that SIU report, am I correct?      In terms of Correctional Services?      Right.  Okay, can we go on then to deal with the Airports Company of South Africa?    We were speaking now at a much more general level.  In other words at a general level, the evidence of Mr Agrizzi deals with payments to various officials in various departments of government, not only the Post Office.  It alsodeals with the award by various departments or various entities of contracts in dubious circumstances to Bosasa.  So, on the one hand, you have generally speaking not limited to the Post Office the payment to officials and senior personnel and on the other hand, you have dubious contracts.  Between them, you raised the issue of the link.  So my question was a general question relating to all the contracts and the relationships across the board.    It is that gap that the SIU fills.    But I am informed by the SIU fills but I am informed nowby the witness only in respect of dealings with Correctional Services.    If we may then go on page 21 of your affidavit Mr Agrizzi deals with the matters related to the Airports Company of South Africa.      Was a tender awarded to Bosasa, a Bosasa company during 2001?    Provide some detail, please.  Correct we received the tender.  The Airports Company awarded us a tender to do their multi-storey car-park protection services and guarding services.  At that stage, they were loosing on average 35 cars a month.  There were a big spate of cars being stolen out of the airport.    When was this contract awarded?  Or when was the contract entered into?    And for what period of time was the resultant agreement entered into?    Okay, who was responsible for the submission for the tender?   Did you also compile the documents?    And who was responsible for their compilation?  The information contained in the document?    Did you receive any information from Gavin Watson in relation to the tender whilst you were busy drafting the documents?    You raise an important point that we should clarify when we talk about tenders and bids.    The company that issues the tender, that issues the invitation to bid rather, in this case, the Airports Company of South Africa, would be responsible for drawing up the specifications for the tender.    And for other documentation and decision making.      Right, you have given evidence or will give evidence thateven at that stage Bosasa might have had some influence?  You will give that evidence in due course.      But in relation to this particular contract you had no dealing in relation to the compilation of the specifications and other documents in the invitation to bid?    Alright so when you say you were responsible for the submission of the tender you were responsible for the response to the invitation to bid.    Now when drafting the document that you did draft, in other words, Bosasa’s bid or response to the invitation to tender, did you receive any information from Gavin Watson?    Did Gavin Watson give you any other information inrelation to whether Bosasa would be awarded the tender or not?    Alright, did he mention any names of persons employed by ACSA, the Airports Company?    In what position or in what capacity?      Yes you already mentioned, in security capacity, do you mean as a security officer or a person in security management, do you recall?    Mohemma, Mr Mohemma?     Did he occupy a managerial or a sub-managerial post?    Okay, in 2009 or 2010 you say in paragraph 11.5 that the tender was re-awarded to Bosasa.     Did you have any personal involvement with regard tovisit to ACSA premises or OR Tambo premises?      Tell the Chair please what happened.    Alright let us take that step by step please.  Who is or was Mr Gumede?  I think you may have mentioned it before, but just tell the Chair again please.    Yes, what position did he hold in Bosasa?      Alright, and these visits to OR Tambo were they coincidental visits?  Business visits?  What were they?   Right.    And you say in your affidavit at paragraph 11.5 and you have just told the Chair that at OR Tambo you met with individuals.    You say in your affidavit ‘from Airports Company South Africa’ how do you know that?    And you say plastic bags were handed over, please the Chair does not yet know about the process and procedure about which we will talk in due course so would you just explain what you know and what you can tell the Chair about these plastic bags.      Evidence bag.    Now you say that you observed money being handed over bye Gumede in the bags?    But you also say that money was not always visible orwas not visible.  If you just saw the bag.    Yes alright that is precisely what I wanted to ask you, you say in your statement you initially suspected that money was handed to the various individuals in those bags.  In other words you are suggesting as I understand it that you did not really know in the beginning that there was money in those bags, is that correct?    I am not following.    So, sorry when you, I am not clear when did you receive money in a bag?  Are you talking about those cash payments on the table that youspoke about earlier in your evidence?    Alright, so that payment was made to you in a bag?    And you saw these bags then.  Please explain to the    Did anything confirm your suspicion later?      What was that?    In other word when you say   Now in paragraph 11.5 you talk about ‘other individuals’ who received these bags.  As you say first on suspicions and then confirm that there was money in these bags.      You said that against the background of two names you have mentioned. Messrs Thanda and Mohema.    Were these individuals ‘other individuals’ apart from those persons?    Can you recall. Well when you say ‘other individuals as well’ I am not following.    What did you observe?  Did you observe any moneybeing handed or any bags being handed to Messrs Thanda and Mohema?    Right, so when you say ‘other individuals’ you mean persons who received money in addition to Thanda and Mohema, is that right?    How long did this practice continue, well first of all was this a once off event or did it occur more frequently than once?    Alright, and for how long did this occur?     And the ...[intervenes]    Alright.    You have ...[intervenes]     Sorry Chair.    You have told the chair Mr Agrizzi that the other individuals who benefitted from these deliveries in the grey security plastic bags were over and above Messrs Thanda and Mohema.    Can you name any of these individuals?    Now, you say they received bribes.  I presume you are describing the cash payment as a bribe.  In what sense do you say it is a bribe?  If you could just describe why you use the word ‘bribe’?    For what purpose?    Alright, and the individuals Messrs Pillay, Serobe and Bashir do you know this from your personal knowledge or from information that you were given by someone else?      Because these are serious allegation let us just put them in to their proper context.  The period of time during which there was some interaction between ACSA officials and Bosasa began in 2001?      Messrs Thanda and Mohema are mentioned in relation to that time period?    You say that was a long time ago, which is correct?    The other individuals you mention in paragraph 11.5 relate to a much later time period 2009 or 2010.    And you recall it, so in relation to that period your    Now you were asked who those other individuals were and as I understood your evidence to be those other individuals included Thanda andMohema, and the persons on page 22.  So it seems to me we have to take out of the category of ‘other individuals’ Messrs Mohema and Thanda?    Thank you.  And the other individuals in so far as you can remember in relation to your evidence in paragraph 11.5 were Messrs Pillay, and Serobe, as well as Mr Bashir.      Please do.    Bashir.    Alright can we move on to the heading on page 22 at paragraph 12 ‘Black Book’.      Let us deal then with your evidence as you set it out in paragraph 12 please Mr Agrizzi.    You refer in paragraph 12.1 to what you call ‘Gavin’s safe’.    Please tell the Chair about that.      Well you, have a look at paragraph 12.1 of your evidence.    And relate to the Chair what you say in that paragraph please.    Sorry when they asked for money?    Is that the description or the word they used?    What is a ‘walk-in vault’ just for those – of us who have no security experience.     And no windows.    And a high security metal door?   Anyway there was this walk-in vault you say behind the main boardroom?    Alright let us just get this correct because there will be further evidence.   Video evidence in this regard.  You say that in your office you would be talking to Gavin Watson and often people employed by Bosasa would come and ask for money.    Gavin would then leave.     And he would come back with the grey security bag?    Right.    From your own knowledge can you say whether Gavin Watson knew what the money was for?    Notwithstanding what you say that some other reason might be given for the request for cash or money?    I just want to clarify.  You have told the Chair that people would come in often and say I need money for what might superficially appear to be alegitimate purpose?    Rulers and pens.    Can you say whether Gavin Watson knew of the real reason, according to your evidence for the request for cash?    Right, good.    Alright.  In paragraph 12.2 you say that what occurred in relation to Gavin's safe and people requesting money and being given money, became the norm after a period of time, you see that?    You were then given a particular task, what was that task?    Why was it necessary to record what was going in and out?    Were there just one or two withdrawals, plenty of withdrawals?    Would it be possible for anyone such as yourself toremember how much went out and to whom and with what frequency?    If not recorded?    If not recorded?    Right.      Whose responsibility was it to account for funds and to reconcile those amounts?    Given to you by Gavin Watson?    Right.    No that is not a problem at all.    Okay.  Mr Agrizzi at the invitation of the Chair, take your time, if you need a break tell us, if my questions are not clear ask me to clarify and I will happily do so.    Right.  You have two tasks it seems.  One, is to see if you can recall any reliable information in regard to shareholding, whether in the BosasaGroup of Companies?    Particularly by Government related personnel, and secondly now the period of time for which you held responsibilities in relation to cash withdrawals and payments?    Okay.  If we can then move on to the evidence in paragraph 12.3 please of your affidavit.  You say there, "what Gavin Watson" I presume it is, gave you certain directions in relation to what you refer to as 'managing the cash'.  What was your duty, or what were your duties?   Before you go on, what would the directors do to justify, or to give you information in relation to the intended recipients of payments?    Right and would they give you any documentation?    And once you had received this [indistinct] request from the directors for money.    Would you then refer that to Gavin Watson, or would you act independently?   And then ...[intervenes]    With the record that you were required to keep of theserequests, which sometimes included, you say names of individuals who were going to be paid, would you then provide documentation to anyone else?      You say that your task was to prepare and package cash?    You were given that instruction by Gavin Watson?    Directors would come to you and say, I need cash, or I need money for sometimes a named person, you would record that information?    Okay.  Did you then personally prepare and package the cash, or did you delegate that to someone else?    And to whom did you delegate?    And was this consistent, or did it vary from time to time?  Did you sometimes package, sometimes delegate, or was it a consistent practice?    I am sorry I did not hear.    Yes and we will talk about that in due course.    Yes.  Now when you gave Jacques van Zyl an instruction to package, or to prepare and package the cash as you term it, did you give him any information in the form of names or amounts?    Alright.  So you refer in paragraph 12.3 – let us first say, you were given an instruction by Gavin Watson to keep records?    And you have told the Chair why it was necessary to keep records.    You have told the Chair that you did in fact keep records?    And we have examples of those records in the bundle and as exhibits which we will produce in due course.    Correct?   Now just to explain in detail to the Chair, the codes that you used, let us refer to paragraph 12.3 at the top of the page 23 of your affidavit.  You have mentioned it, but not in full detail.    You refer there to the code "ELF30PLC".  Please describe how that code is made up to the Chair?    Elford Miatele the recipient ...[intervenes]    Of the monies?    With 30 the recipient?    And 30 denoted how much?    Right.    And PLC?    Did you have any authority to decide upon who should be paid these monies and how much should be paid to them?  And you are shakingyour head.    Please you must say.    Right.  Were you on any occasion asked by Gavin Watson for your opinion in respect of any payments?    And that opinion would sometimes be, I presumepositive, yes a person should be paid?    And what were the criteria that would inform such a decision?    I am sorry, I just want to be cautious here.    You said "I might ask for a bit extra".  Are you referring to what you did, or what someone else might do?    Well you are going to be cross-examined, so therefore it is necessary to clear.    You are saying people would sometimes – I think the language in the trade's 'take haircut'.     Okay.  Let us return please Mr Agrizzi to the keeping of records, the task that you are required to perform.      How were these records kept by you initially?    You have given one to the investigators and we will produce it in due course.   You give that evidence later, but you will also tell the Chair of the relation between that amount and the turnover or profit of the company asa whole?    And in relation to the overall profits, or the overall income, even the overall turnover of the companies ...[intervenes]    In Bosasa Group, was it a significant proportion?     Right.  Let us just finish the evidence in paragraph 12.5 please.  You say, initially you kept this information regarding payments, recipients andamounts on loose pages?    You then progressed to keep these records in various A6 books?    Okay.  What survives in your possession, because we will come to this later, of these lists and books?  In other words, what do you have and what have you given to the investigators?    And we will come to that in due course.  Were any payments made without your knowledge?    Okay.  Well that is a bit of a problematic question and answer if it was made without your knowledge you would not know about it.     Just to clarify, people would have access to the volt in which the safes were kept?    But in relation to the safes in the volt, only Gavin Watson would have access to that safe?    I just wanted to make clear the difference between the volt and the safes.    And that will become clear in relation to certain evidence we are going to show to the Chair in due course.  Chair you will note from paragraph 12.6 that we need to present some evidence to you in a different form.  I do not want to be too particular at this stage, but that would take some time, not only tosetup, so that the witness can control the technology, but also would require a short adjournment to set it up.  So may we take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow?    Per month?    Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.    Do you have any objection in taking the prescribed oath?   Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?    Do you swear that the evidence you will give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  If so please raise your right hand and say so help me God. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My full names are Angelo Agrizzi.    I do not.    I do.    So help me God. Thank you.    Yes I do.  I just want to say good morning Chair, thank you for having me, and good morning Mr Pretorius.    Correct.    Yes.    It is my signature.    Correct.    I have.    They are.    Correct.    That is correct.    Yes I am.    Yes I am.    I am well aware of that.    I have not.    Not at all.    Nothing whatsoever.   I started my employment at Bosasa operations many years ago, in 2009 to be precise, and I left Bosasa on the 15 th of December 2016, and I was exposed to numerous corrupt activities.    I did not unfortunately report them at that stage.    Can you hear me now?   Is that much better?    It has not been possible to recall absolutely.  It is just too voluminous.    As previously I said in my statement, I am more than willing to assist.    Most definitely Chair.    No, I commenced employment in 1999.    2016/2017.  The reason why there is two different dates, is because there was a  process of negotiation until 2017.  My last date of work at the business, was 2016.  15 December.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Most definitely.    I become blunt in understanding what was happening at this stage and I become very accepting, but unfortunately it happens to a lot of people andmy urge as well is for people out there, especially in Bosasa to start coming forward as well, so I was blunt.  I kept quiet and I should have exposed unlawful activities from day one.    I understand that.    The answer to that question is very similar to being involved in a cult Chair that you become so engrossed with what his happening and you actuallystart believing what is happening is right and that is why it took so long.  I had a near death experience where I was admitted into hospital and I had a tumour on my heart.  I was in a coma and when I came out of the coma, myself and my family had made a conscience decision that we will clean up where we had made mistakes before.    That is correct.    From the age of 14.  That is correct.    In 1986, I received my first year.   I did my first year.    I could not afford to.  My parents could not afford to.  I could not work and study at the same time.  It was far too difficult.    I then worked for a restaurant where I had been working already at Jordon [Indistinct] in Germiston.  I worked there fulltime.  I was…  Do you want me to carry on Chair.    I then continued to work.  I tried to study and develop myself.  Understand the industry in which I had found a job and I was then employed by a company called Hospitality Food Services where I was the project manager for andindustrial catering company.  I then left hospitality.  I honestly wanted to make a difference in the mining industry, so I joined Genco Mining and I worked for one of my mentors there who trained me and taught me about large scale facilities, high density catering services.  Then in 1993, I accepted a position that was offered to me as a project manager with a company called Supervision Food Services at Western Platinum Mines in Marikana Rustenburg.   So I relocated with my family.  I was then promoted to run a Nissan Roslyn’s Facilities Management in 1994 and again relocated my family.  In 1997 I applied for a position with a company called Grantham Integrated Food Services and I was stationed at Oryx Mine in Welkom for a period of 8 months.    Correct.  It is in my statement.    Eight months.    I was promoted to take over various other operations like Impala Platinum Mines.      In 1998, we were in the process of listing Grantham Integrated Foods into Molope and I was asked to take over the inland region in its entirety.    Yes.   She handled my administrative work as a PA.    Correct.    Molope Foods, the reason why Molope Foods was listed was because of the Grantham Integrated Foods.    Correct.    I worked very closely with a gentleman by the name of Danie Liebenberg.    Yes he did.    He told me about a company called Dyambu Operations and a person called Gavin Watson.  He told me that Dyambu was exploring the possibility of replacing Molope at that stage as the caterer at Scott Hostel, so in order to gain work as support, because they utilise the facility, he would provide them T-shirts and caps, branded Dyambu to the workforce and they would then obviously protest against the current catering contractor being Molope and to support Dyambu in obtaining the catering contract.  That was the modus operandi.    Yes I did.    In 1999, I was opening up a place of safety called Nerina Place of Safety in Port Elizabeth and I was on my way back from Port Elizabeth and I was at the airport and I heard a gentleman speaking Xhosa, but I also heard some distinct words.  Dyambu Chair, mining and catering.  I then did my research.  We did not have Google as good as it is now, but I did my research and I found that it wasGavin Watson whom Danie Liebenberg had told me about.    Yes.  I was not unhappy with Molope, but I just felt I needed a new challenge and Dyambu, I believed had good BEE credentials.  There were strong women empowerment there already then and I was looking for good growth prospects, so I received also wanted to get my share options out of Molope and that is why I wanted to encash them.    Well the country was changing for the better and we saw that the BEE credentials played a major role, especially with the women in Dyambu itself that could take growth in going to the facilities management sector and make it grow phenomenally.    Well not at first.  At first what happened was I found the contact details for Dyambu.  I eventually made contact with a gentleman by the name ofDavid Sadie.  Davie Sadie was very impressed with me apparently and he took me to  Danny Mansell who was the Managing Director at this stage.      Yes I did.      At that stage it was still Dyambu Operations (Pty) Limited.      Yes I did.  I met with him at 10 Tom Miller Street.  The old offices of Dyambu and he asked me a couple of questions.  During the meeting hediscussed procedures and the way they were doing tenders and evidently they were not experienced, so I pointed out some of the flaws that they had in the tender submission.  The accuracy thereof and how they needed to improve it going forward.    Substantial.    Correct.    On the administration. Yes.    Yes most definitely.  At this meeting I was then followed up.  Itwas followed up by another meeting and I got a call to ask to see Gavin Watson.    It was Thursday 7 May 1998.    Yes Danny Mansell introduced me to him and he was present.    Well immediately when Gavin Watson met me, he offered me a position as a marketing coordinator and at the same salary that I was earning at Molope and he informed me that if I accept the employment, I must commence the verynext day Chair.    Well I was given a company tie.  Danny Mansell was sent out.  He came back with a company tie and a jacket and he said – Gavin Watson said well you are employed.    Mansell – my apologies.  Mansell raised his concern about the financial implications of my salary.  I understood that.  Gavin Watson just accepted the fact that I was going to be employed and that I had accepted the position.    He was a shareholder and the CEO.    Well immediately after that he took me around the offices and took me on a tour of the facilities they had there and he started introducing me to everybody as his new right-hand man.  He also told me I could get a brand new company car Chair and my mind was made up.    Yes.     I was well paid at Molope for the work that I did and I was not expecting an increase.  It was too high in terms of comparatively what Dyambu was paying people at that stage.    Chair, I was well known in the industry.  My credentials were out there and I believe that David Sadie the Human Resources Manager did do averification the day before and he checked my credentials out.    Yes.  At that stage, I was busy in the process of doing a proposal with a company called Goldfields that had a mine called Leeudoring Gold Mine.  That is on the West Rand.  Leeudoring Gold Mine employs about 4 000 people and houses 4 000 people.  I was responsible for the proposal that was submitted and    Correct.    The agreement was with Goldfields Limited, the Union, there was a tripartite agreement between Goldfields, the Union and at that stage Molope.    Yes.    It was the National Union of Mineworkers.   He was very flustered and he asked me to accompany with Dr Jurgen Smit on the Monday 8 May to actually go there and to ask them not to sign the agreement, but to give Dyambu an opportunity to put it a proposal as well.    Dr Jurgen Smith was one of the owners of the previous company before it became Dyambu of Meritum together with Fanie van Zyl and Dr Jurgen Smith was a quasi-mentor to me as well.    Unfortunately yes.    It was for the provision of catering services.    I can mention that Chair.    Well at the end of the day and I remember this when I worked    Most definitely.  Very strongly.    Yes.  Most definitely.   No, they are not included as part to the agreement, because they cannot enter into a legal agreement on behalf of the Mines.    You are hundred percent right.  I apologise Chair.    Well Gavin Watson asked myself and Dr Jurgen Smit to go have a meeting with Patrick Maine and Charles Freelander, Chair, who was at thatstage the Union representative that stood for the Union.    Patrick Maine was the Human Resources Manager for that specific Mine.    Correct.   The reason Mr Watson was so flustered was because there are three gold mines in the area which are from the same group called the Goldfields Group.  They invited catering proposals and quite simply whoever is awarded one of the catering operations will automatically eventually take all three andtake the monopoly on it and Gavin had been working…  Watson had been working for some time on Kloof Mine marketing and having a presence on the ground with the Union and encouraging the Union to go with them and he had submitted a proposal on many occasion for that contract.    The reason – the decision I made was to resign and that was because the new car had been already delivered to the offices by the time I had visited Bosasa – sorry Dyambu, so I had made my decision up.    Yes I did.    Yes I was.    Chair, there was a big difference between the two.   In favour of that stage, it was Dyambu.  Unfortunately, I was young.    I then proceeded to the offices of Molope and I resigned and I handed in my resignation letter to Mr Greg Lacon-Allin.    Yes, it does.    Well I actually started on 10 May 1999.    Yes I did.    Correct.    I did tender notice period, which I explained ...[intervenes]    To Mr Watson.    But they decided in those positions at that level, they normally let you go straightaway.    Yes I did.    No.  I did not.    Correct.    I did not let them sign the agreement.  Yes.    Correct.    Chair, I was very frank with them.  I honestly believed I hadfound a better company with better services at a better price, so I asked them to wait a month or so.  Let us prove to you that we can provide a better product.    Yes.    Correct.    Very close with – Mr Chair, he would take me everywhere.  I would even have to drive his car for him and he would sit next to me and he would praise me all the time and he would really bounce decisions, integral decisions regarding the company off me.  It appeared to me as if he trusted my knowledge andmy ability.    Correct.    Chair, I am very bad with dates and when I did the statement, I might have made a mistake on the dates.   That is right.    1999 is the correct date.    Yes chair.  I am sorry about that.    Correct.    Will do.    Correct.    That is correct Chair     I was employed by Dyambu.    Yes.  He told me that he helps the comrades.  That if they have a funeral, he feels he should contribute.  Even though there is not a contract and that is you know disputable as well.  It is not the right thing to do if you think about it, but – and then I was told that people are being paid to support Dyambu tenders and they did support it, believe you me and later on I was actually present when money was actually handed over to certain of these individuals.  One individual that comes to mind was Jackson Mafeka who was the leader of the NUM for Kloof Division in Goldfields and I was present at those meetings when money was actually handed to him and hisvehicle was also maintained by Dyambu.  We had an internal workshop and they would maintain his vehicle for him as well.    The meetings would often take place at the offices of Bosasa or Dyambu at that stage.    Those offices were at 10 Tom Miller Street.    In Krugersdorp.  Roodepoort.  That area.  It was the old WestRand Cons Mines Chair.    Correct.    Well at those meetings I saw him getting money from Gavin Watson.    It was always wrapped in a bag.    Because the common practice would be to use the grey type security bank bag to put money into.    Most definitely.    I did not actually see the cash.      Yes.    In October/November 1999, Dyambu at that stage was awarded the catering contracts for Kloof and Libanon Mines.  We then decided to rebrand the name Dyambu to Bosasa.      Most definitely.  My responsibilities got more and more.  It just grew phenomenally.  I started getting more involved with operations, with Human Resources, doing very much what I used to do at Molope previously.    No.  I was very responsible for getting the new brand out there, doing presentations, booklets.  I would draw up new costing models and proposals and I would later become responsible for the complete operation.    I just want to correct that Chair.  At Molope I was an Operations Manager.  I have always been an Operations Manager.    Yes.   Marketing Coordinator.     I never had a title Chair.    No, it changed dramatically.  I had a lot of additional functions that I would get involved with and run.    ‘Jack of all trades’ would have been the correct name Chair.  With all due respect, there was no name given.  I was involved with everything.    Marketing.    Coordinator.    Correct.   Correct.    Correct.    I would be integrally involved in the management and submission of all tenders.   Chair, if I may.  I am a Christian and when I joined Bosasa one of the predominant reasons why I made that decision, because I believed it was God-sent, however every morning there was – I was told there was a prayer meeting  in some mornings and I got to know a few people and they would attend and between 12 or 15 people would attend every morning and it was led by Gavin Watson.  He would lead the prayer meetings and I was impressed.  He would share a verse out of the Bible and it would be discussed, but everybody would have to pray out aloud.  That was the rule.  I was Gavin Watson’s right hand man, everybody looked to me, that I attend the prayer meetings, so I was compelled to attend the prayer meetings.  During 1999, they extended the prayer meetings, another employee, a youngster who I had kind of grown fond of and taken under my wing to mentor, Leon van Tonder was at these prayer meetings – shared that these prayer meetings should have happen every day if wewant God’s blessing over the company.      Ja.  Just give me as second Mr Chair.    No, no.     Not necessary.    So we started every morning and I believe, I really do, that it    Yes.    Some of them have left, but these are the positions they held at the time.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    I do not know if you want me to refer to my statement Chair or ...[intervenes]    Well quite simply Chair – thank you.  In 2016 August I resigned.   Okay.  On about 25 August I entered into a settlement agreement with Bosasa Operations, Consilium Business Consultants, Daniel John Watson, otherwise known as Cheeky Watson and Gavin Joseph Watson.    Indirectly, it was part of the Bosasa Group, but it was owned actually by Jurgen Smith.    Because I had resigned and they wanted me to come back urgently.  They wanted me to be on a fixed term contract for a period of 10 years.    Yes, I did.    That is correct.    I was promised Chair, things will change dramatically and allthe points I had raised previously would be addressed.  That is why.    Yes.  ANNEXURE C is the incorporation of provisions regarding the consultancy agreement which was entered into on 18 March.  Basically it is as settlement agreement to get out of the previous 10 year agreement.      Yes.   Yes.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   The second agreement provided for a consultancy with Bosasa at that stage and it provided to pay me a monthly consultancy fee which was equated to about a 10th of the previous agreement.    Should it be paid in full, yes.    Yes.  That is correct.    Yes.    Correct.    The consultancy?    No.  It has been cancelled.    Most definitely.    Chair if I understand the question correctly to Advocate Pretorius, am I to explain why I decided to put in my earnings into a document like this?   Yes.    Yes.    Well the reason I put it in there was because partly in the beginning my wife was employed on paper as well as myself.  This was done on theadvice of Dr Jurgen Smit at the moment.  Two reasons.  For the pension benefit and also for the tax purposes and also the relevant fact is that my wife was actually my personal assistant at Molope and when I left Molope because I was in a senior position, she obviously would not be a personal assistant at Molope anymore.  So she was dismissed as I joined an opposition company.    Yes.    No.    Just explain – ask me the question again please.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Part of my salary.    Yes it was.    Not at all    I do not believe it was false.    Well my wife had been working for me and she had been getting a salary.  I am not sure I understand your question or your line of questioning.    Yes.    Yes.   She did not do any work.  No.    No.  Only on paper.    Yes.    I misunderstood the question.  I am sorry.    My answer to that is very simple.  It was not correct.  It was based on the advice.    The answer is yes it was represented.    As there were two salaries paid.     Chair, if I may.  Yes ...[intervenes].    Clarify.  Both salaries were represented to the tax authorities.    She paid tax on what was on paper on hers and I paid tax which was on mine.  The fault that I think we misunderstanding is that they split the salaries in two.    But both paid taxes on those salaries.    But it should not have been represented that way I agree.    Yes.    Correct.      Correct.    I took the advice from Doctor Jurgen Smith at that stage.  Yes.   That is correct.     That is correct.    I was not comfortable with the arrangement of paying my wife.  Besides she was getting all my money anyway, Chair, like you.  So quite simply I spoke to Dr Smith but more importantly what had happened was they wanted us to split my salary because they had two companies Consilium and Bosasa and the decision was from the management that they wanted to split my salary.      Yes, I did.     I would get cash bonuses, cash payments, I would get holidays, I would get gifts from Gavin Watson, I could go to a shop and buy myself expensive clothes that type of thing and I have listed them all.    At that stage no.      Chair ...[intervenes].    Chair, if I can answer that question.  There would be no benefit to me, it would merely appear on the same tax number.  The reason why it was split I can provide you with.      Most definitely.  If you look at the first column it is headed Tax Year, the second column is headed annual earnings next to it is annual earnings of my wife, additional benefits and values.  And unfortunately it is such a long timeago we had to estimate a lot of these.  And then a cash payment received.  And each year is according to the IRP5’s as well that were attached hereto.      Correct.     Yes.    It is natural I suppose.     That is true.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    What happened was I was doing a lot of travelling and I was working very hard and the directors are all entitled to some sort of benefits and perks.  And I was called in and I was told listen you are doing such a great job that we would like you to upgrade your vehicle.  And I was given the difference between the current trade in and the new vehicle as a bonus.     Yes.  What happened there was I was doing a phenomenal job apparently and Gavin Watson had a Q7 in Port Elizabeth and he sent it down to me and said to me I should take it over.    Correct.    That is right.     That is a combination of the retention and the separationagreements in other words the agreement, the first agreement and the second agreement which was paid in bulk.    The correct figure is R 27 391 651.00.  Ja.    The estimate is R 22 million.    No.    I have made a note of that.     Not in full at all.  They were late on the agreement at one stage.    No, I never said that.  I said, Chair, that I cannot remember exactly what was paid of the R 22 million of the agreement because that they did notpay in full.    Yes.    Correct.     It is fine.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    That is correct.    I was not happy about it and they could not reflect my total salary because it would be an embarrassment to the other directors that were earning much less than I was.     Correct.    I have made a note.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    It was Meritum Hostels (Pty) Ltd.    The shareholders there was Dr Jurgen Smith and Mr Fanie Van Zyl.      They had a contract with a youth centre, a youth development centre now called Mogale Youth Development Centre.  It was known then as Meritum Youth Development Centre.  It also had the Lindela contract and undocument [sic] migrants are kept there as they are today.      A Youth Development ...[intervenes].    Youth Development Centre is where Government pays us,the Department of Social Services pays Bosasa or Meritum, pay them a fee to detain a child that is awaiting trial.  So they would pay a fee, and for that fee they expect quite a lot of services, training, development, cleaning, catering, laundry services, medical services, social services for the child.  At Lindela the provisions is very similar but more focussed towards the adult and all those services with exception of education is paid for by Government.     To hold undocumented migrants before they get deported.    They did.     Correct.    That is right.    That is right.    Correct.    Correct.    I did not.   I have not been at the company for quite some time I did not compile it, I do not know who drafted the document, I cannot verify the veracity of that document.    It is a guide.    I do.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.   Yes.    Bosasa Operations the group.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Chair, my understanding is this was as it was then.     Correct.    That is right.    Chair, things would change very frequently.  Directors would change, it was often difficult very difficult to keep track with everything.      Yes, they did.    Correct.    It is now called African Global Operations I believe.    Correct.    It has become Black Rocks Security Intelligence Services (Pty) Ltd.    Yes, there was.    The name was always Bosasa Youth Development Centres (Pty) Ltd, Chair.     Correct.    That is Lindela that has the contract with the Home Affairs Department to keep undocumented migrants.     The facility ...[intervenes].   Where Lindela operates from is owned by Bosasa Properties.    The operations are held by Leading Prospect Trading and they are outsourced to Bosasa Operations accordingly.    Correct.   I believe it is known as GTS.    That company has done quite significant work in terms of electronic surveillance and technology.      For the Departments of Corrections, the Department of Justice, I do not know who else of late.    Phezulu Fencing does high security mesh, welded mesh fencing and is made – it became known predominantly with the Department of Corrections contract as well.    No.    It is related to because it is owned by Gavin Watson.     Consilium Business Consultants used to be owned by late Doctor Jurgen Smith and I think his son had a small shareholding in that.  And there was an agreement that Mr Petrus Venter would take it over when Doctor Smithpassed away.  And he put it in to his wife’s name so Mr Venter so that it could not be linked directly to either him or Bosasa.    It is impossible, Chair, impossible.      Wherever I can assist and I remember I will you the truth.    That is correct.     Yes.    I am.  I thought you were – you were referring to when I joined Dyambu.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Mr Ciopella was a consultant to Gavin Watson personally and his background, I am, I have been told, he was a bodyguard for the late struggle stalwart Peter Mokaba and Mr Ciopella was, I know, involved, he told me he was Fana Hlongwana in the arms deal and he was also involved, he told me, with Thalante Myeni in PRASA.  That is what I know about Mr Ciopella.      Sorry, he told me he was involved with Mr Fana Hlongwana at the arms deal.      There were names mentioned at, from time to time, different names of different politicians that would come up and this was many years ago.  Ifyou, just when we changed the name from Dyambu to Bosasa .      Yes.     No.    Whenever Mr Watson would be questioned as to the veracity of a BEE company, he would then rattle of names such as Girly Pikoli, LindiSesulu, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula.  I cannot remember all of them right now.      Are you asking me?  Sorry, Mr Chair, are you asking me if I know there were factual shareholders in, in the, in the Bosasa Group?    They told me about it, but I cannot vouch for their word.  I can only refer to the shareholders’ register and to the CIPC documents that are there.     Correct.    I do not have them, no.    Correct.    The names were mentioned to me but I cannot vouch for them.    Of course I would.    I would prefer to do that.    Correct.    Chair, initially Gavin Watson was not actively involved in the day-to-day management and running of the company.  That responsibility was given to Mansell.  When I started within a couple of months, he would take more ownership of it, but at that stage, he was only coming once or twice per week.  He was also Casino License Consultant to Sun International and when his contract ended with Sun International, he became more actively involved with the running of Dyambu Operations those years.  So this was during 1999.      I am referring to Dyambu Operations.    The shareholders were Gavin Watson 50% and Danny Mansell 50%.      Correct.  It was changed about 1999, 2000, Chair, and that was when we got new contracts into the company at that stage and the decision was to rebrand it and there was some negativity regarding Dyambu, so we - That is when the name changed.      That is correct.   Yes, these were the Libanon Contract, the Libanon Gold Mine, Kloof Gold Mine, there was at a stage some other smaller operational mines that we had, we had become involved with, like Sasol and that type of thing.    It was located at number – we called it Number 1 Windsor Road, but there is actually no number there.  So, Chair, what we did was, we actually took over the old Gold Fields Security Head Office, and it was, we calledit [soundtrack interruption] in Luipaardsvlei.     Correct.    It had degenerated and it was a bit acrimonious at one stage.    That is correct.    Danny Mansell sold his shares and those shares were then used to divided it up into the newly ...[intervenes].    Well, he sold them to Gavin Watson.   They were then divided up and put into various smaller little entities and that.  That is how Gavin decided to structure the company.    Well, it is to fund ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Basically it is to fund.    The fashion and the manner and the purpose is to fund for BEE status.      Yes ...[intervenes].    Yes, he did.      He came back as a consultant to assist Gavin Watson and I and carry on further [indistinct] in the statement.    That is fine.    Well you, you will recall that I mentioned that we did a catering services, Chair, full facilities management of mining hostels as well as we had the Lindele Repatriation Facility and then Youth Development facilities as well and services we provided to the Department of Social Services but then also we, we were involved with certain smaller security contracts if I recall correctly.    A full facilities management service contract is managing the facilities and I would identify it as saying high density accommodation facilities. So, your typical mining hostels, that type of facility.  So you would do everything, from catering, cleaning, from room allocations, maintenance, painting to even recreation and running the bars and canteens.      Catering services were providing a good, well balanced cooked meal.    Correct.    Correct.  Cooking, preparing, presenting and then also the waste disposal and everything that goes with it.    The Youth Development Centres are what is says earlier, that they take youth that are currently awaiting trial, we get, at that stage Bosasa  Youth Development Centres was getting paid to house, accommodate, clean, feed and train children.    It is exactly the ...[intervenes].    Same thing.    Chair, the new contracts that we had received, there was a massive growth spurt that we had there from 2001.  One of the contracts was Sasol SA.  We had Brandspruit and Twist Drive where we were running catering services.  We had a full facilities contract with Kloof and Libanon Mines which was operated by Gold Fields.  We had a, we, we received a contract with Hartebeesfontein Gold Mine which entailed three hostels.  We had a full facilities ...[intervenes].    Correct.    We had a full facilities and catering facility with Randfontein Estates, in Randfontein.  Then we had a full facilities contract with Harmony GoldMines in the Free State.  We also had a catering only contract with Goedehoop Collieries in Witbank.  We had a catering contract with Oryx and Beatrix Mines in the Free State which are also part of the Goldfields Group.  Then we also ventured into the South African Post Office to perform security services for the South African Post Office and we also had a guarding agreement with the airports company at OR Tambo International and that was to guard the multi-storey parkades.      It was - Chair, it was locally concentrated but it evolved toinclude pension pay-out points at a later stage.      Well, in the Gauteng area predominantly at that stage.      Correct.    Yes.     Correct.    Chair, when I arrived in May of 1999, I must clarify because I saw the mistake with the date, but when I arrived in May 1999, the one of theissues was that they had submitted a proposal to Sasol Mining for the ...[intervenes].    At that stage it was Dyambu.  They submitted a proposal to Sasol Brandspruit and Twist Drive but something was amiss because there was a problem with regards to the process of how they put in the tender and also how they costed the tender.  One of the big issues was that they had under-costed on the overheads and they had included it into the meal cost and that threw out the tender completely.  I was then asked to go and rectify the problem.  I was told who I would meet with and who was going with me to rectify the problem.    No, the tender had closed already.  The bid submissions had lapsed.    It was improper.    I was then asked ...[intervenes].    Yes.     The tender submissions had ...[intervenes].    Correct.      Yes.     Correct.   That is standard practice.    That is right.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.   That is correct.    All right.  I was requested that I go with someone to Sasol and meet with a certain person at procurement and ask them if we could adjust our pricing structure at that stage.  I was told it is not a major problem for them and I submitted an adjusted price where I explained in depth that there was an error in the way it was submitted and the tender was then allowed to go through and the contractwas awarded, initially to Dyambu but we had requested them to put it in the name of Bosasa because it was at the time that we were doing the name change.    Correct.    I said that earlier, I, I interacted with somebody that was appointed from procurement.    The procurement official was actually annoyed, Chair, because they had been instructed from a higher authority to make the change andallow the change.    I cannot remember the name of the person.    Simon Mofokeng was the Head of CEPPAWU, which is the Chemical Energy Paper Printing Food And Allied Workers Union.      Yes.     Well, I got a call from Gavin Watson, he said that we have got to go and have a meeting with Simon Mofokeng and he was the Head of the Trade Union.  So I had to drop whatever I was doing and he would, he would go through and see Simon, with me.      He said the purpose of the meeting was to sort out Sasol.    By putting pressure on the Union.    Well, it was traditional for Dyambu, Bosasa  to put pressure on the Union, to create a work stoppage so that management was forced into submission in giving a tender.    Well, Chair, that is what happened.     The other ones did not involve Mr Mofokeng.   Yes, yes.    No, what I am trying to explain and maybe I am not listening properly but I had a very late night.    Last night preparing.  So, my apologies for taking time.  The fact of the matter is that in that Sasol tender, Mr Mofokeng had an influence.      My understanding is that the Chair asked me the question, did he have any influence in any other tenders or mines.  Mr Mofokeng’s only mine that he had influence was, over Sasol.   Correct.    Apology accepted.    No.   I was to accompany him that is correct.    Correct.    Yes.     This meeting we discussed the pricing proposal and I was told to just resubmit the pricing proposal as per the suggestion of the procurement official as well, resubmit it and we should not worry.    That was Mr Mofokeng saying that.    You are hundred percent right.    Well, he basically informed us of what the other bidders’ prices were at the meeting.  So he submit, he told us what pricing structure weshould look at because the one thing about the procurement official was, they would not reveal the actual pricing that other companies had submitted because ...[intervenes].    No, correct.    Yes.     You are hundred percent right.    He had a phenomenal network at Sasol being, heading up the CEPPWAWU Union.     Chair, I only realised this maybe a month after the meeting with, the initial meeting with Simon Mofokeng that we had employed his wife to head up a newly established training department.  Her name was Maureen.      I presumed it was correct because we modelled our newsubmission, using those indicators, and we were successful.    Correct.      That is correct.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes, it did.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes it did.    Yes Gavin Watson got the information that was an error in the way the pricing was done.      Yes I did.    Instructions were to arrange various things it was braai packs, Chair, it was cold drinks, it was various grocery items, that type of thing.  They had to be delivered to Simon Mofokeng.    Basically what happened was each operation had a unit leader.  In this case, the unit leader was a gentleman by the name of Sidney Mantata that had worked for me previously at Equality.  Not Equality sorry Molope.  He got an instruction that this is what you have to provide on a monthly basis.  He would bring a purchase order to me, I would sign it off and he would then purchase the goods according to the purchase order.  He would then deliver the good to Simon Mofokeng wherever Simon Mofokeng wanted it.  I did it exactly as I was instructed.      Yes he was, Sidney Mantata.    Correct.    That is right.    Correct.    It was a variety of goods.  Cold drinks, grocery items, meat, a lot of meat, a lot of frozen chicken, maize meal, variety of grocery goods and drinks.      I would just sign it off because it had been agreed between Gavin and Simon Mofokeng.  So I had no reason to question it.      I would sign the order, Chair I would approve it.   I would approve it and with the approval, he goes and gets it.    It would be permission to pay a bribe, yes Chair.    With those types of amounts it would just be absorbed as operational marketing expenses.     No it was a regular occurrence.    Monthly, normally.   Chair they commenced when we received the contract and they continued until we sold that contract.  They continued even past then I believed.    He would basically deliver it to Simon Mofokeng.  Occasionally I would get a call thanking us from Simon Mofokeng.      At the time I would say at those years it was about 12 to R15 000.    Personal circumstances month.    Yes.    When he felt that he was being done in and he needed extra,perhaps he needed an extra couple of kilos of meat, he would phone Gavin Watson and complain incessantly.  Gavin Watson would then pick up the phone, phone myself and request that I attend to it and just sort out the problem.      Gavin Watson never ever received a delivery.  We are talking about Simon Mofokeng.    There were a few times.     At that stage, the contract was managed by a gentleman by the name of Daniel van Tonder and another gentleman by the name of Johan Viljoen.     Yes they did.    Correct.    Those years probably yes, not today.      Correct.    Bosasa held the contract form 99 till about 2002.  Then what happened was we unbundled the Bosasa operations and we had sold off some of the catering contracts and mining contracts.    They were sold to a gentleman by the name of Gregg Lacon-Allin and the companies name was Equality Foods.     I got a call from Gregg Lacon-Allin we use to work together previously at Molope.  I got a call from him one day to say that Simon Mofokeng had indicated that he wants his benefits and he asked me if it was standard practice.  I explained to him that well it is not the right practice and it is not standard practice but it is specific to Simon Mofokeng, as he has always got this undue benefit from Bosasa.    Well the work that was involved in terms of the tender was the provision of guarding services for the South African Post Office.      Sorry when was the tender awarded?   I would have to check my notes.      I cannot remember all the dates.  Excuse me?    In June 2002 then, why would you ask me?  Sorry?    Sorry, Chair.    Yes.    I was.    I was told to start preparing the logistical preparations far before the tender was submitted.      It was originally a three year contract, that is standard.  Then it was extended I think for two years.      Yes he did.    Well the two names that were mentioned were Sivhewe Mapisa and the other named mentioned was, I think Mandla, is the pronunciation, Manyatsi.      That is correct.    It is a gentleman.  His position.    Was the head of security employed by the South African PostOffice.      He was the CEO of the South African Post Office.    Sivhewe Mapisa hold shares in a company owned by Gavin Watson’s brother Valance Watson and the company if I recall correctly was Vulisango.   That is correct.    The inclination was quite simply ...[intervenes]     The information was that he was paying them and looking after them.    Sorry Chair I do not understand that question.      That is correct.    Okay we went to a Dubai tradeshow especially on security applications, I was looking to bring in new security solutions and systems at that stage.  But we had a free day ...[intervenes]    Myself, there was a gentleman by the name of Johnson Vovowho was also a Director of security, Johannes Gumede, or Jo Gumede who was also a security director.  We had a free day after the expo and we spent it shopping.    In Dubai.  So apart from buying items for family like jewellery and that which is ideal to buy over there, we bought a Cartier pen, Cartier cufflinks, Montblanc pen, Montblanc cufflinks, and various other gifts, I cannot remember all the gifts, but there were quite a bit.  Even bought some false watches and brought them back with us, but they were premium gifts.  Those gifts were actually for Mr Manyatsi and Mr Mapisa.  I cannot remember the other people.    Yes he told me he gave, he had given it to them and it was confirmed because I remember meeting with Mr Mapisa somewhere and he thanked me for it because he really like it.      A Cartier pen and cufflinks.     I remember that specifically because it was a Montblanc pen and they gave a free pair of cufflinks.    Yes Ronny Watson got a farm, a game farm out in the Eastern Cape, and they would often go hunting.  They would shoot and we would then have to transport the meat backwards to Johannesburg.     The other brother yes, Volisango.    I would think so being head of security and head of, and CEO, they would have influence.  One does not dispute ...[intervenes]    No.    Chair I mentioned earlier that Gavin Watson had already known months before that we were being awarded the tender.  He was a personal friend with Sivhewe and Mandla so I cannot prove that they were on any tender boards but having worked for a CEO before I know that one does not just lightly take instruction, you just carry out the instruction.      Payments, I was told they will be taken care off and they were being paid.     Hmm.    I want to correct that sorry.  Chair I cannot prove that they awarded contracts because they were looked after or paid.  I cannot assume that I am sorry.   Correct.    Correct.    That is right.    In terms of Corrections, right.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    That is right at the multi-storey.    It was awarded in about 2001 if I remember correctly?    The agreement from what I can recall is a five year agreement and it is renewable every five years.  Bosasa has retained it until I think they still have it at the moment.      I was.    I submitted the tender with documents correct.      I was responsible for compiling it.    Sorry Chair I would just like to go back a step.     The tender bid submission which I submitted and I compiled and I put it together, but I did not put together the original tender questionnaire bid specifications.  I just want to clarify that.      I do not know if that clarifies the point?    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Chair that is what I wanted to clarify.    That is correct Advocate.    Chair in response I was told by Gavin Watson and at thatstage, it was Mr Johnson Vovo that we would be awarded the tender.  Gavin Watson knew a gentleman by the name of Tede Mohema who was involved and responsible for the security contract at OR Tambo and ACSA.    I would like to believe, Chair I would like to believe that they followed a process, that is what I would like to believe.    I was told to get ready because the tender would be awarded to us.    Ha he mentioned the name of a gentleman by the name of Caesar Tando that was involved at the airport at that stage.      As far as I recall it was in the security capacity, risk.    Management.      They were both managerial positions but I think what I need to clarify as well Chair is that people come up with lovely names and lovely titles and it is all very confusing.  So you have risk officers and you have all these security specialists, so I cannot, I know they were busy with security but I cannot tell you exactly what they did.  Is that understood?  Do you understand that sir?    Correct.    Yes I would visit OR Tambo.      Well I would often go together with Mr Jo Gumede and often we would take the grey security bags filled with money and give it to certain people at OR Tambo.      I did say it was Mr Gumede.    At that stage he was a director I believe now he is the chairperson of Bosasa.    Coincidental and business.  Business would be discussed.    But it was business.    Correct.    Well because I knew they were clients, I was working with them.  We had spoken to them on a few occasions.  So we knew who we were dealingwith.      Ja, Chair the plastic bags area  security bag very similar to your standard SAPS security, what do they call it?    Evidence bags.  They were serialised and they have a tamper poof seal.  In this case however the bags are not transparent or translucent they are grey, so you cannot actually see what is in the bag.  That is what they basically are.  So cash would be packed in those bags and those bags would be taken out.      I think they were a standard stock item from a securityequipment sales company.    If I may ask, just answer?    They were not bespoke, they were not specially made.    Correct.     I would, you know there is money inside there because you can see how money is packed.    Well in the beginning I did not know, but remember I had also received one of those bags.      If you have a look at my payments right from the beginning I also received a bag.  I received a bag, so I knew what was in the bags.    Correct.    That is right.    I, obviously I cannot say I saw the money, but I suspected it because I received money in a similar way.    Yes.    When I started doing it for them.      When I would have to arrange payments.    Correct.      Yes.   Correct.    Yes there were other individuals as well.    Yes I did.    Correct.      No it was a regular event.    Well it occurred until I left.      Correct.  Just clarity not in terms of the individuals.  When the individuals left they would get [Indistinct] anymore, but I am talking about payments to people at the airports company was until I left.   Chair this is monthly.      No those two individuals had left the airports company before Ileft Bosasa so they would have been terminated.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Chair I cannot comment on because I cannot remember and I do not want to say anything that would be untrue.    Correct.   Well I can recall some of them I have alluded to them in my statement.  In my statement it says it was Ruben Pillay, Jo Serobe, as well as the Procurement Officer Mohammed Bashir.    Well because it is unduly benefit, benefitting somebody ...[intervenes]    To coheres them into doing what you want them to do.      Chair I packed the amounts on may occasions myself, keptrecords of it.  On many occasion I would have to attend and hand out the packages.    Sorry Caeser Thanda is a gentlemen and [Indistinct] Mohema is a gentleman as well.      I cannot recall delivering it to him at all.  In terms of packing it, I cannot recall, I actually cannot recall I am sorry.    I cannot ...[intervenes]    I actually cannot recall which specific person I did it for.      Did I do it?  Yes.  Can I recall who it was?  No I cannot.    Yes.   Sorry Chair can I just clarify?  In terms of the more recent people as alluded to Bashir and that yes those I can recall packing and delivering, those I can.    Correct.   Correct.    It is 2001.    And I recall it.    Correct.    Correct they were previous.    And, sorry Chair, if I remember anymore I will add them.    I will do.    Yes.    I can give you background to it.  Normally if somebody isinvolved in bribery and they do a deal what would happen is they would get a monthly payment in stead of a lump sum or perhaps every second month they would get a monthly payment because that way according to the way I was explained my superiors at the time you then have a hold over that person.  Because they, what happened they get their lifestyle accustom to that, so they were monthly payments.  So to answer you question, yes they were monthly payments and if I was not around when they were delivered they were delivered.      No I can remember distinctly.  Chair it would be delivered by the person that is working with that specific person.      Correct.    Sure.    Yes.    Well I do not understand do you want me to explain where itis?  What is in there?    Yes.    Okay.  Gavin Watson would spend a lot of time in my office and so would every other director would spend a lot of time in my office and normally I would be behind my desk and I had a small table and they would spend time there.  So a lot of the times directors would come in and ask Gavin for money because they needto sort this person out or that person out, or they need to literally pay bribes.      Yes.    Yes.  So Gavin would then go to what I referred to specifically, and what everybody else did, as ‘Gavin’s safe’.  Now Gavin’s safe is situated in the walk-in vault and there were numerous walk-in vaults at Bosasa, must be about eight.      A walk-in vault is as what you see on TV it has got a big vault door, double thick door, and it has got walls around it, with a solid concrete roof, and normally there would be shelves or something inside.  That is a walk-in vault.    No windows.    The beauty about it as well, yes it is impenetrable normally.      Correct, so that was Gavin’s safe and within there, there is other smaller safes where lots of money is kept.  He would go – people would come into my office, ask for money and he would have to leave and come back, leave and come back, and this was done openly.  I mean people would see the grey security bags moving around the company.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes he would have to go and get the money.    Yes.    Chair if they wanted to buy anything else other than bribingpeople they would have gone to petty-cash.  I had very stringent forms in place.  This was for bribes.    Chair if I can also add as well?    You know what people would do is they would come and say, 'oh no' they would come to me and they would say, I need some money because I need to buy some rulers and some pens to donate to someone.  People are like – we are allthe same, when I was small I used to go to my parents and ask for R10 because we have to go and watch a play.  It was not really a play it was the tuck-shop money that I actually wanted.  People are like that and we all fault and so often people would go to Gavin and say, I need money for this but it was not really for that.  So that was one of the issues.  To answer your question, the money that people got from the safe was bribe money.      Yes they were mostly Bosasa Directorate, Bosasa Senior Management and other people from outside would also come and ask.  You are right.    Yes.   He also knew they were for bribes.    You refer to the money as monopoly money, it is just easily disposable.      Correct.    Correct.      Yes.      Chair if I can answer your question very simply is that, it was there for bribes and if it was used for something else, I did not know about it.      Most definitely.    Until the day I left yes.      I agree, I do know Chair to answer, some money was used for people's bonuses, that is it.   Correct.    To manage and try and record what was going in and out.    Because you need to reconcile at the end of the day.    No you are talking quite a few withdrawals and continuous.      Well if you recorded it yes then you would, which is what I did and I could remember ...[intervenes]    Sorry?    No you would just know how much money you had given out in total maybe.    Chair to answer your question.  Normally you would not go and double check, but sometimes we used to do our little checks in the background.      It was my responsibility.    Correct.    Chair I must be honest, I had a late night last night preparing and I cannot remember, I am a bit fuzzy on that.      Yes I will check up on it.    Ja I am sorry I just cannot remember right now.    Yes.    Sorry I only got home at 02   Okay.    No, no we can continue.    I will do.    Correct.    Ja.    My task was to prepare and initially package the actual cash itself.  So I was required to keep a record, which I did, in a little black book, and normally I would attend to the directors, individuals that we were going to pay.  I would also communicate the relevant amounts to Mr Watson.    They would motivate it.    Yes.  Sometimes they would write a list on a piece of papers.  Sometimes it might even be a SMS and they would motivate it like that.      Yes.    It was a new name, or a new amount, I would have get approval from him.      Ja if it was a standard name.  Because we had standards per month that we get.      Sorry can you repeat that please?    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Well I did delegate it, I was busy so I would delegate that to someone else.     At one stage I delegated it to a gentleman by the name – one of the accountants Jacques van Zyl.      No it was consistent with Jacques, but then at one stage I had to take it away.    I said at one stage I had to change the system, but it was a consistent system.   Okay.    Ja.  I think what I would I do is, I would code it.  So if you look at the example that I use in paragraph 12.3 is I used Elford Miatele (?) who was one of the clients at the Mines and the agreement for – that Elford received R30 000 a month and Elford's code would be ELF30 and the person who took it to him his names or initials or coding or nickname would be put behind and it would be written on the bag.  And that – I would basically give those codes out.  The bags would be returned to me filled with those specific codes written on the top.    Yes.   Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    It was made up Chair in my head.  So ELF would mean to me Elford and ...[intervenes]    It is correct.    And ...[intervenes]    Thirty was what he had agreed to, to get paid.   Thousand – they would denote 30 thousand.    We never talk thousands or millions or anything like that, because that would be too obvious.  We spoke in hundreds and tens, so it was hundred and ten you know, and the 30 would denote 30 thousand.    PLC would be the person collecting it and in that instance it was Patrick [indistinct] and he was from Catering, so that is why it was PLC.      Yes.    Most of the times we would apply that.  But soon people started to realise the codes.    And then we had to change it again.    So it did not apply all the time.    Never.    Chair never.  I could motivate, but I could not make a decision on my own.    Yes of course Gavin Watson would ask me, listen should we pay this person, what do you think about that and I would give my opinion.      Sometimes.      The most important Chair was; is the person going to be useful for the organisation and is the person supportive of the organisation, then yes.  So it was a quid quo pro situation.    You have hit the nail on the head.    Normally what would happen was – there would be a motivation Chair.      From the person wanting to make the payment.    The applicant, let us call them the applicants.    No they would normally ...[intervenes]    What would happen is, there would be a middle – a person in-between.  So let us say I had a client and I felt the client should be looked after, I would then motivate what I think the client should get.      I might motivate a little bit extra so that I can get a little bit extra myself you know.    Oh yes, ja no definitely.    Ja.     Yes.    No, no not me personally.  But sometimes people would...[intervenes]    Okay.    Haircuts.      Chair to answer your question, ninety percent of the times it would have been discussed, or asked of.      Yes.    So initially I would use a loose piece of paper and I would actually write the amounts on in codes to facilitate the packing of it, because I was very busy.  And then later on the big problem was loose pieces of pages go missing, so I kept recording various A6 books.  Unfortunately I do not have one here, but a small little black book and ...[intervenes]    Yes, yes and there are pictures of it in the Annexures as well.  And that information on the notes would be then transferred onto these books as well.  But sometimes these books went missing after they had been submitted and eventually more than one book would be kept in rotation.  So you will use one, pack one away, use one, pack one away.  So you would rotate them.  So we could never actually account for every single cent that was sent, that would be impossible.  Because you are counting for now and then going forward there might be another person drawing from that specific safe.  So that was the issue.  The only person though who had access to that safe was Gavin Watson.      Ja I can enlighten you Chair.  Are you just talking about cash, not other favours?    Cash?    Between R4 million and R6 million a month.    Yes.      Yes.    Correct.    No it is a drop in the ocean.  It was not a big proportion, it did not stick out.      Correct.    Correct.    I have given the investigators one of the books that has got the figures in it, as well as some of the lists.    Numerous.    But what would happen is – sorry Chair.  What would happen is, you would leave "X" amount there and you would have an opening balance and a closing balance and the next week you would come and there is nothing being written in the book and it has just gone missing, well it disappeared.  That is why I can qualify and I said 'numerous payments' without my knowledge.  Because when you start with ten and you end up with two, eight had gone missing.      That is right.    Correct.    Yes.    Hence my response yes.    The volt and the safe.    Yes sir.      Yes.    Chair the lowest amount was about R5 000 and that would go to an employee as a monthly bonus.      Who – to an individual?    About R1 million, sometimes much more.    Yes.      Thank you sir.
