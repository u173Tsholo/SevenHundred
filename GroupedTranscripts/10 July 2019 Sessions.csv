CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Sello, good morning everybody.    Yes are you ready?    Yes okay.    Ja let her be sworn in or an affirmation be administered.   Thank you very much.    The lever arch file containing Ms Helen Janet Walsh’s statement will be marked Exhibit BB13[a].    Yes.    Yes thank you.  You said how many lever arch files.    Two okay alright thank you.    There are also two other lever arch files that relate to Ms Walsh’s evidence.  The one will be marked Exhibit BB13[b] and is volume 1, volume 2, volume 3.  The other one is marked Exhibit BB13[c] and it is marked volume 3, 4 and 5.  Each one of them contains documents relating to certain transactions including invoices and receipts.    Ja.    Thank you.  Okay.      Let us start.    You may have to raise your voice as well.    Yes.   You are a Chartered Accountant.    Okay.    You have worked for Transnet for thirteen and a half years in the financial department?    Ja okay.  I think you might …    Have to raise your voice it is quite low.    Ja.   Maybe it is because it is in the morning.      Okay.    May I take you back to paragraph 11.  When you have received an invoice and you say you verify the invoice, what does that entail?  Verifying an invoice.    That part does not involve you checking whether the work has been done?    No.    To this stage ja.    So somebody else would have checked those things?   So would it be correct to say the verification of the invoice is nothing more than simply checking whether it contains all the information it is supposed to contain?    As to what it relates to, who it is from and which department is – it relates to that kind of thing and obviously the amount?   Okay alright.    I am sorry.  The – would the process owner – did yousay process owner?    Yes.  Would the process owner be located in the finance department or would they be located at each department or unit or various units of the – of Transnet so that each department or unit has got its own process owner?    Yes.   Yes okay.    Um in the case of a department there would obviously be a head of the department.  Would it normally be the head of that department or it can be anybody in the department?    Yes.   Yes.    Hm.  So if we have – if he – if we have evidence that I have heard where it appears that payments were made in circumstances where services were not rendered the person to look for who should have checked what services were rendered and whether they were rendered properly or what goods were purchased.  That would be the process owner relating to the department concerned?    Yes.   Yes.  But that is the person whose duty it is to check that – to make sure that Transnet does not pay for services that were not rendered?    Okay thank you.    I am sorry.  HJW1 is where.    Yes okay thank you.    I guess that is if they can count as well as you count?   Ja.      I think you must tell us – read the amounts for eachyear and then ultimately give us the total.    Okay.    Yes thank you.      No millions.    Yes.    Well just before that I see that in relation to Regiments in the first year in which payment was made the amount was R25 million – R25,7 million to round it off and then the following year it almost was four times more than that being 90 million – 90.2 million to round it off and in 2016 even that 90 million of the previous year was more than doubled in the following year.  Is that correct more or less?    Yes.    Okay.  You may proceed.    If these figures do this to you as a financial person imagine somebody who is not a financial person.    I am sorry.  That is 10 billion?    Sorry?    Shoo.    Ja, okay and the previous one was 11 billion?    Yes.   Yes, okay.    I did not want to correct you.    You would not know who was Program Manager?    You would not know?    Okay, alright.    Which 13 – A or B?    B?    Okay.    Is that at page 100?   2-7-5?    Yes I am getting there.  Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ms Sello …    It may be helpful if – I mean these – (clearing throat) excuse me – lever arch files for EXHIBIT 13A and B they appear to be quite well arranged but you did say that under each volume are documents relating to …    100 or 164 - if there could be something written to indicate …   Ja.  So if I look at it six months from now …    I can – I can tell what it relates to.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay. Thank you.    I am sorry. The previous figure, is it 1 billion comma nine?    Okay thank you.    I am sorry; what paragraph are we on now?   Thank you.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay. We will take the tea adjournment and resume at 11h30    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    One second.  Thank you.     So Ms Sello you are familiar with these high figures?    That total is not very clear. MS HELEN JANET    At least on my copy.    Yes.      Oh I see in the handwritten annotation is it there at the bottom, is that the same amount?    Okay.      Ja.    Yes, no that’s fine.    She means you will revert to her and her to me.    Yes.    Thank you very much – very much for evidence MsWalsh.  If we need you to come back we will ask you again and I am sure you will assist.  You will of course assist with the part that Ms Sello mentioned in the course of your evidence but thank you very much and you are excused.    Thank you.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay we will adjourn for five minutes.    And once you are ready we will resume.    We adjourn.    Are you ready?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.   Okay, thank you.    Thank you for coming back Mr Callard.    Thank you.    Thank you.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Thank you.   Was the correction not about the colour?   Was the correction about the colour?    Was the correction about the colour?    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Thank you.    Now they are the first, second and third supplement –supplementary statements of Mr Callard.  There is that file.  That relates to something that has already been …    Hm.   Okay.  Let us - let us get this right.    This one?    Has this being entered already?    Oh.  This is just for convenience?   Oh.    Oh, yes okay.    All of that has been entered already?    Okay and then there is the file relating to Mr Yusuf Mohamed – EXHIBIT BB4G?   Excuse me.  The file containing the statement of Mr Yusuf Mohamed and annexures will be marked EXHIBIT BB4G and then there is this lever arch file …   For Mr Laher.    Did you say it has two statements …    Of his plus annexures?    Each with annexures, ja.    But they are all in this lever arch file?    Where is the second one?    Number?    Hm.    That is a statement that goes up to page 20.    Ja.   Yes.  So those are its annexures?    Ja.    Well should you not – should this divider be written something like Mr Laher’s second statement or supplementarystatement or whatever it is?    But you see all along when we have a lever arch we give an exhibit number to the whole lever arch file.    Now we said this is EXHIBIT BB4F …    But that EXHIBIT BB4F relates to – then you have gotF21 …    And this is F.2 …    But it is confusing.  Oh it is - why could you not …?   Why could you not just have it as BB4F and the – the contents can then relate – indicate that there are two statements?    So it is one exhibit …    But it has got two statements and each statement has got its own annexures and the index …    The index shows - shows that.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes just F4, ja.    Yes, ja.    Yes, ja.    Yes.    Yes and – and for convenience where you have thatdivider before the second statement …    You could just also write – you know – second statement …    Or something like that, ja.    Then – then all one needs is to know that one is dealing with EXHIBIT BB4F and if one wants to find the first statement it is at page 1.   If one wants to find the second statement it is at page 2 whatever.    Ja.    Okay, alright.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    The lever arch file containing Mr Yousuf Ismael – I am sorry.  Am I on the right …?   Oh.    They are both Yusuf.    So that is what is confusing me.  The lever arch file containing the two statements of Mr Yousuf Ismael Laher will be marked EXHIBIT BB4F.    Ja.   Yes I have got it.  Thank you.    Well either you or Mr Callard must just say what Mr Laher’s …   Points are – responses are first or response before dealing with it.    Ja.    Ja.    Well you – you know better what you have in front of you …    But I – I suggest that you take it in manageable …    Ja, ja bites and see what – what he says and let ushear what Mr Callard’s response is.    Then – then I will follow.    Ja.   And what page would that be?    Oh.    Oh.  I am looking for the …    Pagination number.    Huh-uh.    I – I saw – I saw it earlier.    I seem to struggle to see it now.  That is in BB4A hey?    That is in BB4A?   Oh.    Okay.    Ja.    Yes.  Okay.  You said page?    Okay.  Thank you.    I am sorry.  I am sorry.    Should we not drop the point one because later on we – we will not have point one and point two for the transcript?    Ja, ja.  Well you should just say first statement andsecond statement.    So that it will not be confusing, ja.  Okay.    What paragraph?   Okay.    What is your estimation of how long we might need Mr Callard?    (Indistinct).    If we resume at two that is up to four?    How is your availability tomorrow Mr Callard?    You are available tomorrow?    Yes.  I am not feeling terribly well.    I think it might help if we stopped.  Then I can dowhat I need to do to try and make sure that tomorrow I feel better.    So maybe rather than adjourn now for lunch and come back and proceed up to four and then tomorrow I am worse.  It might be better that we adjourn now and adjourn for the day.   Ja, ja.    Yes.  I – I have asked that arrangements be made for another witness to – Mr Ntshisi to be here tomorrow at 10.    But I think what we will do is start with Mr Callard since he is in the middle of the evidence and then continue and then when he finishes then I can hear Mr Ntshisi because there was no otherwitness you had for tomorrow.  Is that …?    Ja, ja.  No that is fine.  Then Mr Callard we will ask that you come back tomorrow at 10.    I am sorry that we cannot proceed.    I think it is going to be much better in the long term that we adjourn now.  We will adjourn now and then tomorrow we will resume at 10 o’ clock.  We adjourn.
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Morning Chair.    We are ready thank you Chair.    Chair before we begin in the past few days you have been hearing evidence relating to Waterkloof.  For the record and for future readers today we revert to the evidence pertaining to Transnet.  The Chair will recall that in the week we had Transnet’sevidence we had testimony relating to specific transactions the acquisition of 1064 locomotives.  The second transaction relating to the 0 locomotives.  The third in respect of the acquisition of 95 and insofar as 1064 is concerned there were two related transactions – transaction advisor – advisors and relocation.  We present today a witness who is going to speak on payments relating to each and every of those transactions and that is our witness for today Ms Helen Walsh.  If I may request that she be sworn in Chair?    Thank you Chair.    Chair we have prepared bundles for the evidence of Ms Walsh.  We have taken the liberty of marking the range BB13, 13.  The Chair will have …   Indeed Chair.    And Chair you – you may ignore those two files to your left for the moment they are for the next witness.  Ms Walsh’s evidence is based on a number of documents that are kept by Transnet and these relate mainly to invoices and payments in respect of those invoices.  She has prepared two bundles of copies of those document.  She – unless the Chair directs her the way we havestructured her evidence she will not necessarily refer to these bundles in the course of her testimony.  We however need to submit them into record as evidence of claims and payments.  If the – in that regard we have numbered – there are five volumes in all spread over two arch level files which we have taken the liberty of numbering BB13[b] and [c]respectively.  And with your leave Chair if I may hand in the Chair’s copies?    There are two.    The Chair will note that on the spine we identify them as BB13[b] and we indicate in each arch level file where which volume is located.  So 13[b] has got volumes 1 and 2 and these are divided by transaction and it has got a start of three which a big transaction 1064 which overflows into the next volume 3 then it isfollowed by 4 – volumes 4 and 5.      Indeed so.    Thank you Chair.   Against that background then Chair we are ready to start.    Ms Walsh thank you for making – for availingyourself to the commission.  Before we get into the gist of your testimony today could you give a – could you point out to the Chair what your qualifications are?    Excuse me Ms Walsh just pull the microphone closer to.      Still raise your voice.    Thank you.  You state at your paragraph 5 of your statement that by virtue of working in the company’s group finance you have a clear knowledge and understanding of the payment processes involved within Transnet?    Can you take us to – through what those payment processes involve?    Thank you.  And starting at your paragraph 12 you detail the request made to you by the commission and the nature of evidence required that you provide to the commission.    And can the Chair accept that all those payments accord with the process of payment that you have just articulated to the Chair.    In one form or other?    Okay.  If we may then turn to – oh no before we do so.  At your paragraph 14 you put a particular qualifier would youlike to state that for the record?    You set that out here in paragraph 11.2    So then if I may just to clarify follow up on those questions that the Chair has put to you.  You in the finance department receive an invoice and which you expect is that to beunderstanding which you expect the person allocated for the management of particular transactions would have verified the invoice – verified the transaction.  That the transaction does exist within Transnet would have verified that the claim being made as per the invoice is correct and that payment is due and payable in terms thereof?    Is that what you are stating at paragraph 10?    So as a finance department you then do notdischarge the duty of determining whether or not the work claimed for has been carried out it is for somebody else to do that?    And you say that somebody – programme manager would that be a…    I see you refer to them as employees?    But what would we call someone who is responsible for that particular transaction?   Process owner okay.  Thank you.  We – you have testified that already up to…    Chair yes Chair.    Yes so throughout the organisation yes.    Thank you Chair.  And if I may just ask a last on that.  Should it be our understanding therefore that every transaction that is handled at Transnet a process owner is identified for that particular transaction?   Thank you.  Moving on then to your paragraph 15 which based on your testimony should be where we are.  You introduce there an annexure [indistinct] HJW1.  Can you speak to this annexure and if we may turn there to then you can take the Chairthrough that annexure.    15 – yes that is it 15.    15.  Page 15 Chair.  There are two there.  There is one on an A4 sheet and another on a better – which appears better at A3 following there.    Before we deal with this Ms Walsh youindicated that all the figures contained here in your HJW1 are derived from documents under your control and proof that these – these payments were made by Transnet to the – in respect of these transaction, is that correct?    Would that proof be found in what we have identified as BB13[b] and [c] which are your five volumes of claims and payments?    Okay.  So those two files BB13[b] and BB13[c] if anyone had the energy to add up all the invoices and the payments they would reach the same total that you reach at HJW1?    Thank you.  Then you may deal with that…    Okay we are now at HJW1 if you may understand – explain to us how – its makeup and how it should be read?    Okay so that – that takes care then of the 95 locomotive transaction.  You have the next heading as 100 locomotive transaction.    You may deal with that one.    Yes.   Hm    Unless I misheard did you say 9 million or 9 billion?    Okay.    Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.   Okay.    So that is the 1064 transaction.  Okay we can move onto the next which you have listed under the heading relocation costs.    The last one.    Take your time.    Those were huge figures you just read out.    Thank you.   And the – the last entry of – of that page you have a total spent per annum and then you provide a grand total (intervenes).    Now that – that is up to 2019.  Do you know whether – whether or not in respect of anyone of these transactions anyfurther payments are expected to be made going forward or have all transactions being settled now?  Would you know?    Thank you.    But insofar as 1064 is concerned are there any further claims to be made by the OEMs to Transnet to your knowledge?    No by the OEMs to Transnet?  Is Transnet still owing any of the OEMs in respect of 1064?    So further payments are still to be made?    Then based on your answer do you have a sense of – I am looking at 1064.  Your total there is 32 9-odd billion.  Would you know what percentage that represents relative to the total payable to each OEM?  Is that 32 billion 40 percent of the …    Of the contracts?  Are you able to say?    Would the Process Owners be in a position to assist us in that regard?    Thank you.  Thank you Mr Walsh – Ms Walsh for that detailed response.  You – at paragraph 17 you inform the Chairon how he should read the volumes that you have submitted.  These are in BB13B and C.  Is that so?    And you indicate that volume one relates to the 95 locomotive transaction.  All invoices and payments are in volume one?    Volume two is in respect of 100 locomotives?    Volume three is 1064?   Volume four is relocation costs and volumes five contains transaction advisors costs?    So based on your HJ1 - one armed with HJ1 which is the table you have just taken us through if they wanted verification in respect of any particular transaction or payment to any of the listed entities you have listed one needs to first identify the right volume and in that volume they will find the supporting documentation?    Thank you.  If then you may turn to your paragraph 18 and explain the approach you have adopted in presenting this evidence to the Chairperson this morning.    Huh-uh.    Okay.  Then let us turn to the detailed payment listing and you deal with the first one relating to the 95 locomotive transaction from your paragraph 19 and in this regard yourefer us to your annexure HW – HJW2.    So then if we may turn to HJW2 and you explain with reference thereto the approach you have adopted.    My apologies.  Before – before you move on this – your list of – this listing runs over three pages?    Ending at page 19?    At page 19 right bottom corner you have listeda number of payments identified as March 2013, 2014 and so forth until 15?    So technically HJW1 just reflects the total amounts in this respect on 95 as appear at page 19?    And that same system then you apply to all the other transactions?    And each transaction you provide a – you call it a payment listing?   Giving detail in the payment listing of every single invoice that was issued to Transnet the payment that was made in respect of that invoice and the date of payment.  At the conclusion of which you provided a total of payments made in each particular year and the grand total made to that – in respect of that transaction as reflected in H – HJW1?    Alright.  We understand.  Now you have – you say when – when we consider the – the listing in respect of each listingyou have taken the first payment?     And for us to understand the invoices and the payments you will deal with the first payment in each listing?    And once we understand that approach we can apply it to all other – to the rest of the items listed here?    On 94?    Okay.  Then we are at your page 17.  We see that your item one which is your first is an advanced payment of 10 percent of the total contract price of 268 million to CSR which was effected on 21 December 2012?    Okay.  You may proceed    Say that again ma’am?    Page?    Page 21.    Page 21.  I just got confused.  I thought you were talking about an annexure yes.   And that will be for the record your Annexure HJW2A?    Thank you, alright.   Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Sorry.  Before – before – you are too – we aredealing with your 2A.    Annexure 2A which has got two documents.  The first being the invoice appearing at page 21.    That is the invoice we have just dealt with.    That is then followed by another document before we get to HJW2B, okay.    Thank you.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    So the two invoices really relate to the same service so to speak.  Just that the one is VAT inclusive and the otherone is VAT exclusive?    And which one did Transnet pay on?    Okay; and then your – your – the payment is reflected at your Annexure HJW2B.  Am I correct?    And at page 24 this is the payment of 268 million which is in respect of the advanced payment?    VAT exclusive?    Thank you and overleaf it is the same invoice for the same advance payment?    I am with you.   So what we have then at page 25 as the 268 which is VAT exclusive.  Then reflects the 306 million which is VAT inclusive?    Indicating that the VAT then that was subsequently paid was for 37 650 million?    And R60, yes.    The correct figure, thank you.  I take short cuts sometimes with figures but that is – that is how we read it?    Before we leave then that invoice and payment if you can just go back to paragraph – to page 21 which is theactual invoice received from CSR.  I – you spoke earlier about a Process Owner.  Correct?    And I see on that invoice at the top right    New Rolling Stock, thank you.  Who – who has written there in manuscript and who is the person who has signed?  I know they call themselves Program Manager New Rolling Stock but inrelation to this particular transaction what role does he play?  He or she – if I may correct myself.    I am glad I realised it before you correct me Chair.    Okay.    Okay.  Further then down on the document I will skip on the extreme left what looks – I think it is a signature of Mr Wang An in Mandarin of some Chinese dialect.  We will not deal with that.  We will confine ourselves to the English version or the English notations on the right.  It is dated 20/12/2012.Which is 20 December 2012 – the year and it reads again in    Are you able to shed light on who would then have written this and signed accordingly?    Looking at this invoice then you indicated to the Chair that by the time it gets to finance – the Finance Department it would have been received within Transnet in the right department.  It would have been presented to the Process Owner who would verify the correctness of the claimed amount and that the work done which isbeing claimed for has indeed been delivered and the Process Owner would sign. Based on this invoice as an example how do we determine who the Process Owner is?  Is there a way we can do – we can do so?    (Intervenes) available today?    And would it be available from the Finance Department still?    Okay.  I note that all invoices are not necessarily signed by the Process Owner before they get to – to the Finance Division and yet they are paid.  By way of example if you could refer – let us refer to volume two which deals with the 100 transactionand that would be in BB13B Chair and …    BB13B.    B Chair.    And under tab volume two at page 2-7-5 and this is in respect of 100 locomotives.  That is an invoice emanating from CSR for 1.5-odd billion.  I am not reading out the full number.    2-7-5.    Under tab written volume two and as Ms Walsh has indicated volume two are all documents relating to the 0 locomotives transaction.  The invoice appears at 2-7-5 Chair.   And the Chair will note Ms Walsh that that invoice is for a total of 1.5-odd billion.  I see at – it has got no signature, no stamp, no manuscript as with the previous invoice we looked at but when I turnover leaf at page 276 there is a payment advice for the exact amount.  You see that?    Now in a situation like this how would the Finance Department have satisfied itself that that tax invoice is valid and is due and payable?   Okay.  So if we were in truth to get all documentation supporting each and every invoice and payment in respect of that invoice we are talking 10 volumes?    You spared the Chair …   Okay.  I appreciate that.  Staying with 2-7-5 I note that CSR in respect of this particular transaction an invoice does indicate who the contract person is – left – on the left …    Under buyer.  It is Transnet SOC Ltd identified thereafter followed by contact name Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe and giving details of her email and address.   Okay.   Huh-uh.    Okay, thank you.  I think by now we understand how to work our way through your – your volumes one to five and you have dealt with your paragraphs 19 to 21.  You attach yetanother …    Chair.    Indeed.    Identifying that?    Indeed Chair.    We shall update the files accordingly.  Thanksfor the direction Chair.    Thank you.  I would like now – I would like to turn to your HJW3 which you refer to in your paragraph 21 and that appears – HJW3 appears from your page 26 which is the covering page.  The actual annexure at page 27.    Yes.  Please work us through that annexure.    Ja.    Before you go any further on that Annexure. IfI may apologize, Chair. This Annexure was intended to come to have been presented in colour. It makes better sense that way.    And we will endeavour to get a colour version of it for easier reading.    Thank you.    So when we look at HJW3, at the top you have the heading and inside the chart you have another heading CR95 Classelocos 3,432,000,000 and all?    Okay. That figure corresponds with the figure you have allocated to CSR for the 95 locos in HJW1.    What you are providing here is your correlating delivery of the locos with the payment for each specific year.    Acceptance? Yes, that is what.    Absolutely.    Okay. Alright so now we know how to understand HJW3. Basically it is an overview of the entire 95 transaction?    In terms of acceptance and payments, okay.    Thank you. So then and then you are suggesting to the Chair that when we go into the volumes and look specifically at 95, we should follow the same format?   In respect of each invoice?    So we understand how you do it and how you move on to the 100 locomotive transaction at from your paragraph 22 page 6.    Yes    Sorry, Chair. We are at her paragraph 22 statement page 6.    Thank you.    Hm.    We are at HJW4 page 29.   Yes.    Before you move on, I see at HJW4 that listing you provide for 100.    Extreme left under item number, I see you started 95.    Please explain.   Okay.    And that will then.    Take us to 141.    So when you say first listing in respect of 100, it is actually item number 95?    And that is for ease of our reference?    Yes, you may proceed.    Yes.    And that is appearing at page 32?   Yes.    Yes.    For the record claimed by China South Rail?    Yes.   Yes.    Okay. And then at you HJW5, you once again provide a better view of acceptance of locomotives and payments to CSR in terms of 100 locos over the March 13 to March 2019.    Okay. And once again or I will just follow the same format in dealing with the invoices 100.    Andrew also draw a conclusion that you havedrawn at Annexure 5B, Annexure 5?    Of your statement.    We then move on to the 1064 locomotivetransaction.    Ma’am if I may and I do beg your pardon. Before we move to 1064, it is something is drawn to my attention hereperhaps that might, we might benefit from your explanation in regard thereto. If I may take you back to the 100 locomotive and the invoice you have provided. I am starting at page 32 of your statement BB13A. that gives me, that is the invoice for 1.5 billion.    It tells me it is, that is the advance payment?    in respect of the 100?    When we turn overleaf at HJW4B which is thepayment advise at page 34, at there is a breakdown of that amount of 752,400,000. Two of them which do add up to 1.5 billion.    What we are trying to understand, as that breakdown of 752 million is not, does not seem to arise from theinvoice. What is the source of that information that it was broken down in two?    Okay. Looking at this payment advise, who could return to for clarification? Is there anything on this payment advise that would assist us?    Okay.    Yes.    Okay. Should it become necessary we shall seek their assistance. Thank you.    I had interrupted you Ms Walsh. You had now turned to 1064. So if you may go back there.    Hm.    Yes.    And that detailed listing is, you have included as your Annexure HJW6. Am I correct?    Yes. Which appears on your page 38?    And the first again of those is not item 142.    Okay.    I have located it.    Hm.    Yes.    Okay.    And that invoice for record purposes, you have as Annexure HJW6A.   Starting at page 42 actual invoice at page 43.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay. Going back to the actual invoice atpage 43, again there is quite a bit written there. A manuscript, the gist of which is to request payment on this invoice.    And it would appear that is allocated to two separate accounts and the total is 960 million odd. Correct?    There is a signature under that manuscript dated 27 March 2014.    Are you, do you recognize that signature atall?    No, okay. And then you say at 6B at page 45. This if I may go back to your 43. 43 is an invoice for payment of 960 million.   I turned to 45 which is supposed to be the payment advise for that invoice.    It has two invoices there paid. The invoice we are dealing with is the first entry of 960 and there is another invoice that appears there for 1.3 billion giving a total of 2.3 odd billion.    Yes.  How, looking at 45 I see how it relates to the invoice we have just dealt with at page 44. Talk to us about the1.3 billion. Where is the invoice for that?    Are you able to assist?    Yes.    Let us look at it differently then. Would your payment listing reflect that 1.3 odd billion?    That is what you cannot answer. Chair, I see itis just gone past your teatime. Perhaps in that during the tea break, we might try and locate that 1.3 billion payment and the invoice in respect thereto.    Thank you, Chair.    We are now at page 8, page 8 of yourstatement, which is completed the General Electric payments in respect of ...(intervention)     Thank you Chair.  We’ve just completed the payments to General Electric in respect of the 1064 transaction, from paragraph 39 – 30 I apologise, at page 8 you then turn to deal with payments to China South Rail.    Sorry again if you could just move the mic closer to you.  Yes, thank you, alright.   Yes.    And for the record that would be items 260 the invoice is in the volume to 394.    Yes totalling R14 910 751 921.66.    Thank you      Been practicing Chair.    Just to …(intervention).    Thank you Chair, yes Ms Walsh.    The amount of 2billion odd?    Yes and once again at your HJW9 you give an overview of payments to China South Rail, against acceptance of thelocomotives in the period March 14 to March 19.     Yes and we see on this HJW9 that before any units were accepted, slightly over 2billion had already been paid to China South Rail, is that a correct interpretation, in March 2015?    So before the acceptance of 80 just over 6.5 –close to 6.5billion had been paid to China South Rail?    In relation to this contract and the process manager, I guess, is better placed to explain to the Chair how thatsituation arose that 6billion is paid before acceptance of the first locomotive?    Thank you.  So then that takes us to your paragraph 32 and payments to China South Rail in the 1064, you next deal from your paragraph 33 at page 9 with payments now to China North Rail?    And that’s your HJW10?    Yes.    Yes.    Sorry by those you mean the relocation costs?   Yes.    It is then if we look at that – those columns, the first is 2.8 odd billion?    That’s total paid to CNR.    That’s including cost of acquisition of the locomotives together with the relocation costs?    Your second column then indicates to us, of that 2.8billion, how much was for relocation and reflects the 368 which, once again, is reflected in your HJW1?    And the remainder of 2.4billion goes to theactual acquisition of the locomotives.    Okay we understand, yes?    Yes.    Okay and that is a total of 1.3 odd billion inclusive of VAT?   Once again I see that the payment advice at page 64 reflects two payments, correct?    Now if one has regard to your HJ10 and we look at the first entry on your listing which is the one you say you’ve provided documentation for, the 395 – item number 395 is for the advance payment, total amount R994 odd excluding VAT.    Okay and that is a payment that appears inthe first – as a first item on that payment advice, 994?    But we have another one now of 1.1billion plus and it looks like this is the same case as we had with a previous payment advice to…(intervention).   In relation to the 95?    And on this R1 133 958 541.28 can you comment on that payment, do you know anything about that payment?    Okay so what we don’t have is the payment advice for the 994?    Okay, alright we’ll take – we note that.  Before you proceed I – Chair I made a monumental error in making a mental note when we broke for tea to get clarification from Ms Walsh onsomething and no sooner had tea, that note completely escaped me.  With your permission if I may go back.    Ms Walsh I am back to your Annexure 6 (B) – 6 (A) sorry at page 43.  We dealt with this invoice and this is fromGeneral Electric for 960million odd and at page 45 is the payment advice.    And we indicated that, that payment advice actually includes two payments which come to the total of 2.3odd billion.    The first one is the 960 which we can relate back to the invoice that we just looked at.  The second one is 1.3odd billion.   And you had indicated that you would like to give an explanation to the Chair about the 1.3billion and how you propose you deal with it.    So you’ll provide a statement to explain what that 1.3million relates – billion relates to?    And then check and understand whether it hasanything to do with the 1064 transaction or whether it was for other services provided.    Thank you and then if we may proceed on your statement we were – we’ve now just completing China North Rail and at paragraph 35 of your statement you give us Annexure HJW11?    Page 67 for the record.    And by then roughly 1.6billion had been paid to China North Rail?    Okay, yes you may proceed we’re now turning to Bombardier Transportation.   Okay.    419?    So then, according to HJW13 before the first ten were accepted an amount roughly in the region of 4billion had beenpaid to Bombardier Transportation?    Okay, we understand, starting then at your paragraph 39 at page 11 you now turn to the relocation costs.    And we will recall from your testimony earlier with reference to HJW1 that only two OEM’s were paid relocation costs, China North Rail and Bombardier Transportation.    Against that background you can take usthrough the payments of the relocation costs.    And that’s at your page?    Yes.    This is a different one, you haven’t yes?    Okay let’s deal first then with your Annexure 14, that is the relocation costs claimed by CNR.   For a total of 368 odd million.    What we do not have attaching to this listing is the actual invoice and payment.     Our volume 4.  Perhaps if we go over lunch we might just locate it in volume 4 for the Chair so that we can make a note here and see that we have the actual – that the amount wasclaimed and the amount was paid.      Okay then if we go to your Annexure HJW15, that now is a listing for relocation payments made to Bombardier.    And unlike with China North Rail it’s a few payments, you have numbered them items 427 to 471.    And at the bottom toward the right corner, you give us the total being 248millio plus.    And you give us the payment details on the right-hand corner.    Once again yes.    Okay now if you go to your – if you go to your HJW1 you reflect against the relocation – at page 15 you reflect against a payment for relocation to Bombardier the first one being in 2016 in the amount of 190million plus you see that?    Now if you keep you – we have kept our finger hopefully at Annexure 15 at page 81, that first item against item 427 is 12 August 2015, so the 2016 that you referred to in HJW is the financialyear, it’s a payment made between April 2015 and March 2016.    And you reflect it under 2016 as the year.    Okay and as you point out, once again we willtry and locate the invoice and payment in respect of this Bombardier relocation cost and provide to the Chair?    Thank you, so we have then dealt with the two relocation cost and their payments and we turn to your final transaction which is in relation to the transaction advisors.  You start with that from your paragraph 42 at page 11 of your statement.    Yes.    And now – and you have that against items 502 to 837.    What we must understand from this Annexure is that it reflects all payments to both Regiments and McKinsey?    And these payments are strictly for advisory fees – advisory fees in the 1064 transaction?   Yes.    Okay so now we understand then from your page 83 to page 88 you deal with all payments for McKinsey, Regimentsand Trillion by Transnet, is this over a specific period?    Okay so it’s from – at least the payments here are 2010 to 2019?     Financial years, and at page 88 you provide us a total of 1.9 plus billion.    And this is what was paid between the three of them?    Yes so we must understand that althoughthese are fees paid to the three of them they don’t strictly all relate to the locomotive acquisition?    And in fact if we look at page 83 for instance, one that sticks out is item 548 following on that page to the end of that page and that’s suppose to be in relation to the Maputo Corridor transaction.    So – and Maputo Corridor is not part of your evidence today?   Alright, we understand how to read that listing, you may proceed.    Yes okay, we understand you may proceed.    That would be quite helpful thank you.    Now you have dealt – at paragraph 44 you indicate 5million was paid to Regiments, at your page 90 that listing it reflects 267, does that – does this listing indicate amounts claimedexcluding VAT is that the reason for the…(intervention).    So we should note all these amounts here at page 90 are excluding VAT?    The amount you referred to and say was paid to Regiments and for transaction advisory services of 305 is the same amount including VAT?      Then overleaf at paragraph 45 you then dealwith payments to McKinsey?    So McKinsey claimed for R11 million I think – R11 millioin.    And – is it 3 300.    That amount was paid?    Except Transnet allocated that payment to another project?    Which is what you say is listed at your page 90 under item 3 Swat 1.    Incidentally what is Swat 1?  Is it something we should know?    Okay.      Yes.  And then we understand from what you just stated that in response to an enquiry from Transnet it is McKinsey that indicated that the R11 million paid was for transaction advisory services in 1064?    Are you able to explain how Transnet got to allocate that payment to Swat 1 which is completely un-associated with 64?   Are we able to track down how that could have happened at all?    With the – with the leave of the Chair of course may we request that you do that and as part of your supplementary statement explaining that invoice we referred to that shows two payments.  If you could just explain how this perhaps cameabout or what your documents revealed in that respect.    And in your statement then before the Chair you are indicating that the R11 million is – was paid to McKinsey as transaction – for transaction advisory services and you derive that factstrictly from what McKinsey advised you not so much from your records?    Alright we have noted that.  You then refer us to HJW18.    Sorry before you take us there.  You make – you make an important note at paragraph 47 that perhaps you might want to highlight?   Yes please do.    Yes.    And your HJW18 you speak of is from your page 92?   So if we can go there.  You have got a few charts appearing on that page.    Two to be precise.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.   And in respect of the two Regiments and Trillian and if there was a subsidiary – perhaps there are various subsidiaries the first recorded payment is from 2005?    Your earlier table only records payments from 10?    Okay.      Yes.    At page 94.    With an amount of R75.84 million the first figure I read in the chart.    Okay and spreading right through in this case to 2014?    This is McKinsey?    So the Chair should read page 93 and 94 together with annexure HJW17 starting at – at page 19?    So if we want to – an understanding as to how much Transnet has expended on the three we read the two annexures together and the response would be from the year 2006 until 2018, March 2018 that will give you a sense of how much has been expended on each of the entities.    There is duplication?    Because of the overlap of the years?    Yes.    Okay.  But then just for the record have youinvestigated whether the payments prior to 2010 were due and payable?  Firstly have you investigated exactly what they were in respect of – what transactions?    Have you – and you have not investigationwhether there is anything untoward in those transactions?    Are you currently doing so?    Okay.  And may we assume that once you have the answer you shall revert to the Chair as regards those transactions?  So say whether or not there are issues that the Chair should concern himself with.    Through me, of course yes Chair.      Okay.  Alright thank you.  And then you – you have an annexure HJ20 that is for McKinsey, am I correct?  At page 96.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Alright and then you deal lastly with you annexure HJW21.    Okay.    Because I am blessed Chair with a very efficient junior if I may then go back slightly and I want to go particularly to the relocation costs.    What we did not have in – in your file is when the claim was made for relocation and when it was paid.  Ms Molefe advised that if we go to Volume 4 page 1008 and if you may just quicklyconfirm Ms Walsh.    Okay.  Volume 4 page 1008 that is the China North Rail invoice for relocation costs.    And we do overleaf at 1009 that is the payment for the relocation cost?    And insofar as Bombardier is concerned if wego to 10, 11 same Volume 4 1011 that is the first invoice of a number of invoices issued by Bombardier for relocation costs and it is for an amount of R126 907 402 005.02 okay?    And 5 cents no…   I cannot short change Transnet in 5 cents thank you.  And following is then the payment advice.    For that amount and thereafter follows the various invoices issued by Bombardier for the Trans – for the relocation costs and their corresponding payment advices?    Thank you.  Then you please have regard to paragraph 49 and you would like to draw the Chair’s attention?   To the fact that…Yes you may.    Okay.  Now once again I am provided with the documents that are not part of your bundle.  You offer annexures but are in the bundles.  Transactions advisors for the record I would like toread them in the record?  The Regiments – the first of the Regiments invoices for transaction advisory services as at Volume 5 page 1044 that is the actual invoice, do you confirm?    And the payment appears at page 1045.   Of Volume 5.  And thereafter from pages 1046 to 1071 are all Regiments invoices and payments?    Okay.  We shall revert – we will revert to the Chair as regards the McKinsey issue because it has been misallocated.    By Transnet.    And there is no documentation regardingMcKinsey payment of R11 million currently in the files, is there?    Okay.  Is there anything else you – as regards these payments and these transactions Ms Walsh you would like to bring to the Chair’s attention that we perhaps omitted to talk about?    And Chair unless the Chair has any questions for Ms Walsh that is Ms Walsh’s evidence.    Thank you Chair.  Chair we have another witness lined up.  This witness has previously appeared before you Chair Mr Francis Callard.    And he appears to day to deal with responses to his Rule 3.3’s.    Mr Callard is available he is here in the building if I may request five minutes just to…   Sort out …    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    We are ready thank you Chair.    Chair before I request that Mr Callard be sworn in …   We are continuing with the Transnet evidence. The Chair will recall that in May – I will get the – the exact date for the Chair.  We presented Mr Francis Quentin Callard …    Former Engineer at Transnet.    And he appeared from 17 May before you.  We present Mr Callard again today to – before you Chair to deal and comment – to deal with and comment on the responses receivedpursuant to the issue of 3.3 arising from his statement.    To give the Chair a sense Mr Callard’s statement produced 37 Rule 3.3 notices which were directed to firstly individuals directly implicated by his evidence, members of the Board, the Bid Adjudication Committee and the Finance Team that negotiated the 1064.  We identified the members of each of those bodies and served them with notices as well as companies or different entities that are implicated. That gave us a total of 37 Rule 3.3.  In response we havereceived two responses to these 3.3s and in particular from Mr Yousuf Laher who is one of the implicated persons - persons referred to Mr Yusuf Mohamed.  The other 35 have neither responded nor provided a version.  Mr Yousuf …    Mr Yousuf Laher and both Mr Mohamed have provided versions in response to the specific allegations that Mr Callard made.  Neither of them have applied to cross-examine Mr Callard.  So we called Mr Callard here today to come to deal on record with what Mr Laher and Mr Mohamed says in regard to the allegations he had made concerning them.  With …    In that context Chair if then I may …    Thank you.  Chair you should have the statement and annexures of Mr Callard previously submitted.  These were submitted into and accepted into evidence as EXHIBIT BB4A and BB4B.We would now like to hand up the statements by Mr Yousuf Laher and by Mr Mohamed. We have taken the liberty of marking them Chair as BB4F for Mr Yousuf Laher and BB4G for Mr Yusuf Mohamed.    The Chair will note insofar as Mr Yousuf Laher is concerned that there are two statements with annexures.  The reason for that is before we received and finalised Mr Callard’s statement Mr Laher had provided a – a witness statement to the Commission.  When Mr Callard’s statement and evidence was received we then issued a 3.3 for Mr Laher and he then subsequently filed another statement in response thereto. BB4F the arch lever files therefore contains both these statements divided into BB4F1 and BB4F2 and there – there should be a divider in – in the file and those will be the statements that we havereceived from Mr Yousuf Laher Chair.  We have provided a separate bundle. The last time I called it a black folder and the Chair corrected me.  A plastic folder containing Mr Yusuf Mohamed’s statement.    Chair.    What is the question about the …?    The correction definitely was about the colour Chair.  I – I opted for the colour of the back of that folder which was a certain colour and the Chair pointed out that the front is a clear plastic.  So I …    I shall not commit myself with regardscolours.    And for Mr Yusuf Mohamed is exhibit – I have taken the liberty of marking EXHIBIT BB4G.  With your permission then Chair if you may accept them as marked?    I have handed up them both to you.    Thank you.    My apologies Chair.  I forgot to mention that goes with BB14A.  B - the two arch lever files …    C, D and E are in that little folder and all those were submitted during the testimony of Mr Callard previously.    Yes.    Yes sir.    It has already been entered into evidence.  It is Mr Callard’s original supplementary statement.    It goes together with the two arch lever files for Mr Callard.  So …    That were on the Chair’s desk already.    Yes.    All that has been entered into evidence.    That is what we propose it be marked Chair.  That is Mr Yusuf Mohamed’s statement together with its annexures.    The lever arch …    Yes.    Indeed.    It has got two statements each with annexures.    Yes.   They are all in that lever arch file and we – we propose that the first statement as appear in your file Chair be marked BB4F1 and the next one statement be F2.    If the Chair goes further there is a bind – there is a divider.    No, no.  What the Chair has is a file with the first statement …   And …    That goes up to page 20 …    And it will run until page 2-7-9 it is – it is final annexure.  That is the first statement dated 15 April 2019.    Yes Chair.    And at – there should be a divider there and there following starting will be Mr Yousuf Laher’s statement of June which once again starts from page 1.    We – we try Chair.  We called it the EXHIBIT BB4F2 right.  The covering page calls it a statement and annexures in response to Rule 3.3 Notice.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Point 2.    We – we (intervenes).    We …    Yes.    Shows that.    We – we are happy to do so Chair.    As the file currently stands it is correctly …    Marked then BB4F.    So – and that is what the spine reads.    Then in the index we will indicate that there are actually two statements each with - with annexures.   The one shall be F …    One and the other F2.    Yes Chair.    Second statement.    We will do so Chair.    And …    Okay.    We will do so Chair.    At least for now …    We allocate to Mr Yousuf Laher’s statementsBB4F.    Yes Chair.    Mr Yousuf Ismael Laher, yes.    They are both Mr Yusuf.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.    I think I have handed in all the documentation required to deal with Callard today.  Now Mr Callard you have been provided with both the statements by Mr Yousuf Laher and Mr Yusuf Mohamed in response to allegations you made against them in your original statement marked BB4A.  Is that so?    Okay.  I have considered both statements and I suggest that we deal firstly with the one set which is relating to Mr Laher and thereafter we will turn our attention to the statement of Mr Yusuf Mohamed.   Now insofar as Mr Yousuf Laher is concerned his statement in response to a Rule 3.3 issued to him following receipt of your statement I identify five issues that he takes issue with you and I have listed them in this manner or identified them as such.  He takesissues with the – what you say in relation to the increase of the Estimated Total Cost in respect of the 100 locomotives.    The second one is the foreign exchange issue in respect of the 100 transaction.  The use of Yen and Dollar or Yen versus Dollar.    The third is what you state about advance payments made by Transnet both in respect of the 100 locomotive transaction and 1064 transaction.   He then deals with the 1064 business case and claims you made in respect thereto that impact him and lastly he deals with the question of the negotiation spreadsheets relating to the 64 negotiation process.    So those are the five issues that I have identified that specifically relate to you in Mr Laher’s statement …    And I propose to deal with them under thosespecific headings.  So if we – we may then turn to the first which is the increase of the ETC relating to the 100.  In order for us to have appropriate context I suggest perhaps that we start with your own statement BB4A and we turn to that part where you deal with this increase of the ETC and that you do at Chair BB4A page 15 and that isdone at pages 64 and 66 – ag – my apologies.  Paragraphs 64/66 page 15.    You in those paragraphs summing up the – the    That you say at 64.   At 66 you then say – you express a view that   If then we could turn to Mr Laher’s statement – second statement which is the direct response and Mr Laher deals with your – what you state there in various paragraphs.  He does so starting at paragraph 26.    26 of his statement.    And that would be at page 5 of …    Five of his second statement to yourresponse.  So he deals with that from paragraph 26 into 27, 28, 31, 32, 36 and 38.    You have had opportunity to apply your mind to what Mr Laher states?    And if – if you could deal – a comment to Mr Laher’s responses.    The gist of the points.    Then I can do that.    I have summarised them.  I think it will be easier and quicker for me to do so.    In the paragraphs I have mentioned which is 26 to 28, 31, 32, 36 and 38 this is what we are able to extract fromMr Laher’s statement.  Firstly he does not deny that the increase of a billion in the ETC was excessive.  There is not direct denial.  He demonstrates how that increase of one billion was arrived at with reference to a particular annexure he has added to his statement and in his calculation he arrives at a figure of 41 million per locomotive whichwould translate to 4.1 billion. The number we are chasing so to speak is 4.8 billion.  He indicates that Mr Molefe and Mr Singh had been in charge of the negotiations with – regarding the cost of these locomotives and this is from CN – CNR – CSR – the 100.    CSR, thank you.  I tend to confuse them.  My apologies; and at 27 he indicates to the best of his knowledge CSR had requested a price of 49 million per locomotive which brings us to 4.9 billion for the 10 and the Chairperson at the time pitched the price at38.5 million and at 28 he then deals with what transpired from that negotiation and he says that the parties agreed at 44 million per locomotive which takes us to 4.8 billion.  He then speaks to the analysis …    Yes Chair.    In manageable bites?    Alright.    You will follow better?    I am happy to Chair.  If I refer you then Mr Callard to page 4 of Mr Yousuf Laher’s response to your 3.3.  He    But I think we should turn our attention to his paragraph 26.  At 26 he indicates that he was requested to prepare a reasonability calculation.   Which he did …    And which reflected at YL24.    Now if we may turn to YL24 and then I am going to request your comment thereon.  I apologise Chair.  Unfortunately my …    File does not have tabs this time.  That wouldbe at page 45 …    Of the second statement.  The second statement Chair after the divider.  The one that we call Laher second statement.   It is page 45.  Each – each statement has its own numbering.    So it is not a continuation.    What you are looking for is the tab markedtwo …    That separates the two statements.  It is the big tab Chair.    Yes.    Chair.    No BB4F.    Ja, apologies Chair.  BB4F the one we submitted this morning.   Now there would be a big divider …    Indicating two.  That is the second statement which of course we shall rename that divider.    We are now at page 45.    And at page 45 Chair is Annexure YL24 which    And just for the record – I apologise.  Page 45 is Annexure YL24.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    We will get to 31.    Let us just deal with YL24, thank you.    So – yes please go on.   Yes.    So when you say fit for purpose in layman’s terms would be if at the time Transnet paid 41 million and gets the locomotive it is ready to run on the rails?    And now with reference to YL24 you – do – is that – is it your interpretation or do you support Mr Laher’s view that he arrived at the 41 million per locomotive having taken into considerationescalation for inflation and foreign exchange fluctuations from October 2012 to February 2014 adjusted for variations for design, additional steel costs, setup costs, hedging costs, duties and options. Taking all those costs into consideration he arrives at a final figure.  Total cost to Transnet …    Of 41 million.  If the locomotives are acquired byFebruary 2014?    And that he states at 26.  So you are in agreement with him – with the manner of calculation there?    And is that an – a correct approach in your view to calculating a cost of acquisition of - of such locomotive over a period of time as happened in this case?    Okay.  At paragraph 27 he indicates that therewere negotiations held between Transnet and CSR.  Now he informs us that at the time CSR requested 49 million and the Chairperson pitched the price as 38.    Now he does say   He however informs us at paragraph 28 that   “…and that the contract must be drafted accordingly.”    Do you have …?    Yes.  Do you have any comment on – on those two paragraphs?   Yes.    That is our FF4 …    F1 for the record.  BB4F1, first statement in that FF4.    1-4.    Yes.    So we should make reference thereto first statement.    Yes Chair.    Then perhaps for – for the purpose of the transcription Mr Callard has now referred us to BB4F which isMr Yousuf Laher’s statement and in particular to the first statement.    And in this regard you wanted us to turn to page 14 of that first statement.    We are at paragraph 54.  Yes.    So then what is your understanding of what he is saying that the negotiated price is 44 million, his calculation is 41 million?  That i s what you stated.   So in referring us to that particular paragraph what – what do you make of Mr Laher’s response remembering that it is in the context of your finding that you could not justify the increase?    Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Now based on what you have just read from both statements …    Yes.    But before he does that he arrived at 41 million?    He calculated it in detailed form …    For us …   At YL24.  We looked at that annexure.    He tells us in his statement that he is told that the negotiated price is 44 million?   My reading and you correct me if I am wrong is that his calculation – no the negotiated price is in consistent with his calculation?    There is as 3 million difference between the two?    Okay and he does not seek at least thus far too explain that difference …   In that price?    Do you want – want to refer to the exchange rate used?    We will get to the exchange rate issue.    Yes.    At 44?    Thanks.  Chair it has been brought to my attention that always over running three minutes into your lunch hour.    Two hours Chair.    Your mic Chair.   Yes.    Okay Chair.    Back on your feet.  Yes Chair.    We are happy to do so Chair.    We confirm our availability as well for tomorrow morning.    Yes.    I was done today Chair.    Thank you Chair.

MS HELEN JANET WALSH:  Helen Janet Walsh, spelt Walsh.    I do not.   I truly affirm.    Through you Chair I am a Chartered Accountant.    Apologies.    Is that – thank you.  Chair I am a registered Chartered Accountant.    Chartered Accounts yes Sir.    And I work for – I have worked for Transnet for thirteen and a half years in the finance department.    That is right.     Sorry okay.    I will do that.      I think so I am normally not known for being so quiet.  Apologies Chair.    I joined Transnet in November 2005 as the General Manager Group Taxation and I was in the 2006 appointed as the Public Officer of Transnet and I remain in that position.  I am currently the Acting General Manager Governance Risk and Compliance in the finance department and throughout my tenure at Transnet mydirect reporting line has been to the Group Chief Financial Officer.      That is correct yes.    Through you Chair.  The payment process can begin with either the creation of the purchase requisition in ourSAPS system which is our accounting financing system for goods or services received or to be provided based on a procurement event.  We then have delegated authorities that would approve that in line with our delegation provided ultimately coming the board but that is then passed through the rest of the organisation.  Once the purchase requisition isapproved or released by the delegated authority the procurement department issues a purchase order.  If the process does not start with the creation of a purchase requisition a payment advice is prepared in which case no purchase requisition nor is a purchase order issued.  The employees – certain employees in the organisation in certain – in different functions be that in the finance function or in the procurement function will receive delegation to approve invoices for payments.  They are required to ensure that the payment is actually for goods received or services rendered and has been appropriately authorised.  That the documentation complies with any necessary legislation including taxand VAT legislation.  That the allocation of the payment is made correctly and that the funds are available in order to make the payment.  They are also required to verify that the necessary delegated signatories have signed the invoice accordingly and in the event a payment advise is used similarly it must be properly completed, authorised and all supporting documents must be signed and attached.     Through you Chair yes I do.  I have beenrequested to provide evidence on payments made by Transnet in relation to the 95 locomotive transaction, the 100 locomotive transaction, the 1064 locomotive transaction and that transaction includes payments made to the original equipment manufacturers as well as payments made to those same OEM’s in relation to relocationcosts and then as well as payments made to transaction advisors in relation to the 1064 locomotive transaction.    Yes.    Yes they have.    Through you Chair thank you yes.  The documents I present may reflect payments in respect of other transactions made by Transnet but my testimony today is confined to the identified transactions that I noted earlier 95, 100, 1064.    11.2 yes verifying the invoice.  Theverification of the invoice is primarily to ensure that it has got the correct – that it is the recipient is reflected on the invoice, the invoice itself is an original document, that is complies in particular that it is addressed to Transnet SOC Limited with the correct VAT registration numbers.  That it is a valid – that it is a valid tax invoice.     Chair…    No.  That is done by virtue of the signatures on the invoice before it comes to the – to the payment process.    To this stage yes.    Correct yes.  That is set out under paragraph 10 of my affidavit Chair.  The – where the employee makes sure that the right person, the process owner has signed the invoice.    Yes that is correct.    Correct Chair.    That is correct.    Through you Chair yes that is correct.    Correct.    It will be…    Yes    It would – we would call that person the process owner.    That would be correct and Chair just to clarify though the process owner would be the person that receives the services on behalf of Transnet.    So if it were a financial service it may be that it is a finance person but it is not a finance person by definition.    Chair it can be anybody depending on the value of the transaction.    So for a larger transactions it would more likely the head and closer to the head for lesser transactions it may be somebody below that.    It would generally be whoever has thedelegated authority to contract and receive those services.    Yes Chair relating to the department concerned as well as the specific contract.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Thank you Chair through you I have attached this annexure HJW1 a summary of all payments made by Transnet divided into years in relation to the identified transactions.  The summary is supported by – for each payment the associated invoice received by Transnet as well as the corresponding SAP remittance advice or the Swift Network Repot which is a report that is generated in the event of a – of an international payment.  So what the supporting documentation does is proof that payment was made by Transnet on an invoice.  The annexure HJW1 which is on page HJW15.   Through you Chair…    That is correct through you Chair.   Chair through you, yes.    That is correct yes through you Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair through you if we can read from the top left hand side.  I’ve summarised the payments paid per each of the transactions identified in my affidavit.  So if we take the top line, the 95 locomotive transaction payments were made to CSR over the course of a number years ranging from 2013 to 2019.  The amounts in theschedule are VAT inclusive because the amount that is paid to them is VAT inclusive where appropriate.  And the last column on the page then provides the total payments made in respect of that particular transaction to that particular supplier.    Yes Chair.  So for the 95 locomotive transaction CSR was paid R306 295 060,00 in 2013.  The 2013 being a reference to Transnet’s financial year of 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.    In that – in the financial year 2014 an amount of R13 611 600,00 was paid.  In 2015 R1 927 890 921,18.  In 16 R786 630 547,06.In 17 R239 478 467.72.In 18 R156 344 160,00 and 2019 R2 619 809.25 bringing the total paid between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2019 to R3 432 869 565,21 paid toCSR in respect of the 95 locomotive transaction.      That is correct.    Again the 100 locomotive transaction the payments were paid to CSR.  In 2013 and 2014 no payments were made that is due to the timing of the transaction.  In 2015 payments totallingR3 032 720 439.81 were made.In 16 payments totalling R1 911 410 141,31 were made.  In 2017 R58 675 246.14.  In 2018 R152 352 199.20.  In 2019 R4 321 628.45 bringing the total over the period to R5 158 831 654.91.  The 1064 locomotive transaction follows.    There were four original equipment manufacturers are for original equipment manufacturers or OEM’s in that transaction and the payments are split per OEM.  The first one is payments made to GE or General Electric.    Which began in the 2015 financial year.  An amount of R965 712 588.14 was paid.  In 2016 R564 939 592.24.  In 17 R3 068 427 141.62.  In 2018 R3 605 822 510.61 and in 2019 R1 386 446 283.63 bringing the total paid to GE to R9 592 348 no sorry my apologies Chair.   I lost track of my zeros.    R9 592 348 116.24.     I said 9 billion.    And then 592 million.    The next OEM as reflected on the schedule is CSR again payments started in 2015.  In that first financial year payments totalling R2 066 597 586.00 were made.  In 2016 payments totalling R4 447 933 803.57.  In 2017 R2 894 581 708.11.  In 18 R3 250 6040409.78 and in 2019 R2 251 034 414.20 bringing thetotal paid over the period to CSR to R14 910 751 921.66.    Through you Chair the next OEM listed is China North Rail CNR payments beginning in 2015.  In that financial year payments totalled R1 133 958 541 .28.  In 2016 R573 546 451.99.  No payments were made to CNR in the 2017 financial year.  In 2018 payments totalling R745 156 870.58 were made and in 2019 payments totalling R2 314 458.28 were made.  Bringing the total paid to CNR for that period to R2 454 976 322.13.  The last OEM listed on HJW1 is BT Bombardier Transport payments again began in 2015 and amounted toR2 681 358 717.11.In 16 payments were made of R1 371 559 718.42.  In 2017 R8 852 863.80 was paid.  In 2018 R897 402 – R897 402 686.31 was paid and in 2019 R1 058 392 315.91 was paid bringing the total paid to BT to R6 017 566 301.55 and just under that number it brings the total paid to the four OEM’s for period disclosed here to R32 975 642 661.58.    Relocation costs were paid to two of theOEM’s in relation to the 1064 transaction.  The first OEM was China North Rail and payment was made in 2016 financial year amounting to R368 893 451.58 and that was the total paid to them in that regard.  For the BT relocation an amount of R190 361 103.08 was paid in the 16 financial year.  In the 2018 financial year R43 242 522.18 waspaid.  And in the 2019 financial year a further R1 106 846.04 was paid.  The total paid to BT over that period was therefore R248 710 471.30.  The total paid to those two OEM’s in relation to relocation costs therefore was R617 603 922.88.  The last...    Identified transaction Chair through you was payments made to transaction advisors in relation to the 1064.  Payments were made to two entities Regiments Capital and McKinsey and Company.  The payments to Regiments began in 2014 and in that financial year an amount of R25 735 500.00 was paid.  In 2015R90 259 500.00 was paid.  In 2016 R189 240 000.00 was paid bringing the total paid to Regiments to R305 235 000.00.  Payments made to McKinsey began in the 2014…    That is correct Chair.   Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Chair the payments made to McKinsey in relation to the transaction advisory began in the14 financial year where an amount of R11 003 389.01 was paid and that was the only amount paid.  That brings the total fees paid in relation to transaction advisors for the 64 transaction to R316 238 389.01.    Apologies Chair.  I think it was all those millions and billions tickled my throat.    Yes.  Thank you I am done.    Yes Chair.    That is through you Chair that is correct.  So the total spend on the 95 locomotive transaction, 100 locomotive transaction, 1064 locomotive transaction as well as the relocation costs and transaction advisors are then totalled and in 2013 total paymentsby Transnet in relation to those transactions amounted to R306 294 060.  In 2014 amounts of R50 350 489.01 were paid. In 2015 the amounts totalled R11 897 850 293.52.  In 2016 those amounts totalled R10 405 514 809 – I am going to start that number again.In 16 the total payments amounted toR10 405 514 809.25.  In 2017 …    That is 10 billion yes Chair.    10 billion yes Chair.    10 405 billion.    11.8 billion yes Chair – 11.9.    Yes.  In 17 payments totalled R6 270 015 427.39.  In 2018 the payments totalled R8 850 925 358.66 and in 2019 the payments totalled R4 720 235 755.76.  Meaning that over the total period in relation to the identified transactions payments made to the suppliers mentioned came to a total of R42 501 186 193.59.  Chair through you the 95 – the transactions that I do know that have terminated or contracts with Regiments Capital and McKinsey & Co …   And accordingly it is also why the schedule shows no payments subsequent to the 2016 financial year.    By Transnet to the OEMs?    Yes.   Further payments are still to be made.    Chair through you I …    Through you I am not in a position to answer that question.   Yes.    Through you Chair yes.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct yes.   Each of the – I have prepared from the records of Transnet a detailed payment listing which – that detailedpayment listing lists details captured in relation to every invoice received from anyone of the OEMs or the transaction advisors in relation to the identified transactions. The total of that listing which includes the value of the payments made.  Then agrees to the numbers that I have disclosed on my HJW1.    I have then taken the first transaction the first payment made to anyone of those suppliers and attached in my affidavit the invoice associated with that payment as well as the SAPRemittance Advice showing that payment was made by Transnet to that supplier through our accounting system. For each of the identified transaction I followed the same process.  As I have mentioned I have not applied any reason to what I have chosen.  I have simply chosen the first payment made.  All of the payments are therefore at the top of the list of the detailed payment listing.    Chair …    Chair through you thank you.  So HJW2which appears on page 17 states at the top of the – of the first page that it is in relation to payments made for the 95 locomotive transaction.  Each one of the payments has been allocated an item number and because this is the first identified transaction the item number starts with item number one and it goes across the three pages provided that contain the detailed listing to reflect a total of 94 items which is the number of invoices received in relation to the transaction. If I stay with item number one we include it on the detailed listing is the invoice number.  The description of the payment which is taken from the invoice.  The value of the invoice showing on theschedule as the amount.  The VAT if any raised on that invoice and therefore the total amount being the sum of the amount plus the VAT and then last column is the payment date the date on which payment was made.    Correct yes.    Correct.    Yes Chair.  Those – what that is, is a summary of the payments made per annum and that summary per annum agrees to HJW1 the numbers that I read out earlier and the totalof those payments made again agrees to the total of the payments made in relation to the transaction on HJW1.    That is correct.    Absolutely.  They are identical.    Correct.    Through you Chair yes that is correct.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.   That is correct.    Yes that is correct.    That is correct yes.   If I then move to page HJW21.    I said if I move to page …    HJW21 or page 21.    Page 21.    Apologies.  Sorry Chair.    That is correct yes.    If I move to HJW2A, yes.  That is the invoice that the item number one refers to.    On the top left hand side one can see that it says CSR E-loco Supply (Pty) Ltd.  The word “invoice” appears in the top middle of the page.  On the right hand side it says invoice number SA95NEL/01 and that is identical to the reference on the payment listing.    The description on the payment listing isbased on the description contained on the invoice.    Which says advanced payment and the amount reflected on the invoice is R268 679 000 and that is the amount reflected on the payment listing.    If we then move to my Annexure HJW2B that is the SAP Remittance Advice or payment advice from the system – the ERP System.    Yes.    That is correct in fact.   That is the invoice …    Through you Chair that is correct.    Advocate Sello if I can just – I left something out when I was speaking to that invoice.    One will see under the invoice number thespace for the VAT number and it says there awaiting registration.  Accordingly CSR was not yet registered as a VAT vendor in terms of South African VAT legislation and – and the invoice therefore did not include any VAT amount.  Once CSR was registered for VAT if I can refer to page 22.    They issued then a tax invoice which they could do because they were a registered vendor and raised VAT at the rates that were prevailing at the time of 14 percent amounting to 37 million.   Reflecting that the total payable by Transnet in relation to this first invoice was then R306 294 060.      That is correct yes.    Transnet paid on both.  On the first invoice they paid the invoice amount and on the second invoice they paid the VAT then subsequently charged and that is reflected in – the VAT is reflected separately on item two of the detailed payment listing.    Through you Chair yes that is correct.   Correct, VAT exclusive.    Correct.    Overleaf is the payment advice showing that the VAT was then paid – page 25.    Ja.    Correct.   And R60, through the Chair, yes.    That is correct.    Yes that is correct.    Correct.    Chair through you New Rolling Stock.    Thank you Chair through you.  I cannot – based on the documentation before me I could not answer that question …    Clearly.   No.    No.    I do.    Through you Chair no.    Chair through you one cannot do it with the invoice in isolation.  As noted at the top attached correspondence.  All of that would have to be obtained.  In addition Chair as you correctly questioned earlier in my testimony Program Managers/Process Owners sit throughout the business.  As I mentioned in my affidavit the payments and the – and the authorised signatories are based ondelegations of authority. All of that would have to be obtained to follow the trail for approval of the – of the invoice and my testimony and the evidence I have accordingly provided is limited to proof that the payment was made by Transnet.  All of that documentation which precedes this pointhas not been included as (intervenes).    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I do Chair.    The – there would be a lot more information attached as noted on the previous example.  So in each instance I have attached only the invoice and SAP Remittance Advice but there would be other documentation attached to this that the finance staff would have placed their reliance on.    Probably …    More than 10 volumes.  In the – in the – if I may Chair.  For example in the case of in particular locomotives there is quite a process to not so much in terms of the advanced payments which is – which is a portion of the contract but in terms of for example if you are paying for acceptance of a locomotive there is a lot ofdocumentation that is associated with that. So with one invoice if you are paying a percentage for 10 locomotives that have been accepted by Transnet you will have 10 acceptance certificates.  You will have all sorts of other documentation associated – attached to it and without all the documentation I can say that I have seen six lever arch files just in relation to the locomotive transactions to date and that does not include all the payment documentation. So – so I would – I would – I would not like to – to say that as an accountant I can confirm it is nine or 10 volumes …   But it is a lot of paper.    Yes.    That is – Chair through you that is not necessarily the contract owner but that would be the person that was identified by Transnet or Transnet Freight Rail as being the recipient of the invoices.    Who – who it must go to.  So there is – you know – in addition to a process owner there would also be somebody that each supplier would be advised who do we send our documentation to …    In order to ensure that it gets received and the process then followed for payment.    Chair yes.    Chair through you what we have done is for each of the OEMs in relation to the locomotive contracts.  So the95, the 100 as well as the 1064.  We have from our financial records as well as the records of locomotive acceptances created a graft – a chart which shows per financial year of Transnet, the amounts that were paid as referenced earlier in the HJW1 and reflects underneath the number of locomotives accepted into deliver – accepted by Transnet in each financial year. So on page 27 in the financial year ended 31 March 2013 in relation to the 95 locomotive transaction we accepted no locomotives into production but payments of 306.29 million – I am going to round the number off …   As they are in the chart – were made.  Those payments reconciled to my HJW1 as well as to the detailed listing that we discussed earlier.    And the financial year ended March 2014. Also no locomotives were accepted into production and payments of 13.61 million were made. In March 2015 however, 85 of the 95 locoswere accepted into production, accepted by Transnet and that your payments amounting to 1.9 billion were made. In the following financial year being March 2016, the final 10 of the 95 locomotives were accepted and payments amounting to R786 million were made.    1.9 billion, yes Chair.     And then one can see that at the end of March 2016 all 95 locomotives had been delivered and paymentscontinued beyond those dates in, really based on the contract that was concluded but by the date all locomotives had been accepted by Transnet.    Yes.    That is correct yes.    Chair, through you that the correct. I am correlating acceptance.   In the context of these contract delivery and acceptance are defined terms.    So I am correlating acceptance with payments made, yes.    That is correct, yes Chair.   Thank you.    Yes, Chair.    In respect of each invoice absolutely.    Yes, Chair through you.    I have again attached.    Through you, Chair, I have been in relation to the 100 locomotive transaction first also provided a detailed listing of all payments made in relation to that transaction.    Which is in my Annexure HJW4.    Again the payments made for this contract run over more than one page on to two pages in this instance.    And on page 30 we again have the summary of the value of the payments made in each financial yearcoming to the total of 5 billion over the period which again reconciles back to my HJW1; the summary of the payments made in relation to the 0 locomotive transaction.     Yes.    95, yes.    So the item numbers are running sequentially for ease of reference. So the 95 locomotive transaction which was the first one we pulled out there were 94 invoices.    So those ran from item number one for the first invoice all the way through to 94. In relation to the 100 locomotives then I have started with 95 and each invoice I have therefore referenced 95 and going down.    To 141.   141.    It is actually item number 95.   Correct, yes.    So thank you for that, Chair. On that basis I have then selected item number 95 being the first payment on that detailed listing and similar to the previous transaction I have attached to the affidavit as HJW4A, the invoice that Transnet received.    It was again with CSR.    Yes.    Again the invoice reflects the suppliers, CSRE Loco supplier. Their VAT number because they were previously registered, our VAT number, the contact person is also reflected and the description and the values contained on the invoice of the same as those reflected on my detailed payment listing.    In this instance it is an amount of a total for the invoice amounting to R1,504,000,800 being advance paymentfor the 100, 20 e-locomotives which was the contract we are looking at. And… (intervention).    China South Rail.    That is correct. And then I have attached as HJW4B confirmation of the payment made by virtue of a sap remittance advice from Transnet system and then again reflects the sum total of the payment made of 1.5 billion.    R 4,800,000.    Yes, Chair through you indeed. The firstpayments were made as reflected on the chart in the financial year ending 31 March 2015 amounting to 3 billion but there was no acceptance of locomotives. But all 100 locomotives were accepted during the course of the financial year ended March 16 and a further payment of 1.9 billion was paid during that. Subsequent payments were also made in line with the contract.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    So for the 1064 locomotive transaction, Chair.      Yes. I have followed the same process. My Annexure HJW6 starting on page 38 is then the detailed payment listing for all payments made to General Electric was one of the successful OEMs. Again the item number starts with 142.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    I do not know, Chair.    If I, yes. The finance department.    I am sure would be able to advise why on the sap system notwithstanding that it is a single payment as reflectedon this document.    Why it was captured on two line items.    Thank you.    Chair, thank you. So with the 1064 as we noted on the 100 transactions, the item number ended on 141 whichmeant that GE, the first invoice based GE is therefore referenced as item 142 on the detailed payment listing.    The detailed payment listing goes over four pages.   And on the last page provides a total of R9.5 billion page to date to the end of 31 March 2019.    That is correct Yes.     Yes.    Item 142.   That is correct, yes.    And from item 142, I have then attached as HJW6A the invoice.    Received from General Electric in relation to that.    As an aside, I do apologize. This is thebest quality that we could get of the invoice.    I know it is not very legible.    Correct yes.    That is correct, yes.    And then also attached as HJW6B.    Starting at page 44 with the actual payment advise is the sap remittance advice showing that payment was made to GE South Africa Technologies on the 28 t h of March 2014.    Correct, yes.    That is correct, yes.    Yes.    No    Correct.    Yes, sorry.    That is correct, yes.    Chair.    No. Chair, through you I would have to understand the payment made.    And whether it was in relation to this particular contract which is where I have confined my.    Evidence to. Sitting here I cannot, I do nothave the supporting documents to be able to confirm that or not.    That is what I cannot answer.     Chair through you yes.       I have again attached in this instance marked, Annexure HJW8 a detailed listing of payments made to date to China South Rail in relation to the 1064 locomotive transaction.     Again it appears over a number of pages,three in this instance, pages 49 – sorry four, 49 to 52…(intervention).       That’s correct yes.      That’s perfect yes.      Chair through you again I’ve chosen thefirst item on the list, the detailed listing, number 260 and I’ve attached to my affidavit as HJW8 (A) the invoice received from China South Rail in the amount of R2 065 000.00 rounded off and similarly I’ve attached …(intervention).      No and on all copies unfortunately the …(intervention).     that is the same amount Chair, yes.     And then again I’ve attached as Annexure HJW8 (B) starting on page 55 but reflecting on page 56 the payment advice showing that the invoiced amount was paid for by Transnet.      Correct yes.      That’s correct yes Chair.      Yes so in March 2015 – in the 2015 financial year amounts in excess of 2billion were paid in the 2016 financial year 4.4billion was paid and in the 2017 financial year the first 80 locomotives were accepted into production.      That’s correct yes in relation to this contract yes.      Yes.      Correct yes Chair, through you, I have attached again the detailed listing of all payments made to China North Rail in this instance it’s only one page and at…(intervention).     That’s HJW10 yes.     And for the record the item number starts with 395 and goes down to 418.      And on the right-hand side bottom of the page one can see that it agrees to the total payments made of 2.4billion.  I would just like to clarify that on this one, we have separate the payments made to China North Rail as noted originally in myaffidavit between the 1064 transaction and the relocation costs.  This schedule includes all payments made to CNR inclusive of the relocation costs but I have pulled those out separately later in my affidavit, that’s why…(intervention).       The relocation costs yes.     So the total payments made to CNR are 28billion and then the relocation cost as previously advised is 368 meaning that the total paid to CNR excluding the relocation cost is the 2.4billion reflected on the far right bottom of the page, it’s very small printing.       Yes.     Correct.      That’s correct yes.      Correct yes.      That’s correct yes Chair.      I’ve then selected item 395 being the first payment on that listing and attached again as Annexure HJW10 (A)the tax invoice we received from CNR which is on page 62.     And similarly I’ve attached Annexure HJW10 (B) starting on page 63 but reflected on page 64 the payment advice reflecting the payment of the invoice made.  Again, similar to the previous example there’s one payment advice showing the VAT amount paid and one payment advice for the invoiced amount exclusive of VAT.       That’s – 1.133 yes.      Correct yes      Correct yes.      Correct.      Through you Chair, to CSR in relation to the 95 locomotives.      Yes.      So, Chair through you again, this is the 994 is the VAT exclusive amount which was the first amount paid which is reflected on page 65 and on this page 64 it showing that we then processed the VAT inclusive amount of 1.133 but we’d already paid the994 so it’s just the VAT amount, 139 being paid.      Chair, through you, no we do that’s on 65, I think what we don’t have – apologies, to clarify what we don’t have is on the payment listing the 395 is for invoice 00001 that document is – I was unable to find.      Correct yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Chair, thank you.  The 1.3billion is not reflected on the detailed payment listing, I will therefore need to look into the supporting documentation for this payment to understand whether or not it relates to this particular transaction and with your indulgence and through you, have agreed that I will provide that explanation through …(intervention).     That’s correct yes.      Correct yes.      Chair, yes, through you, HJW11 is the – again the picture representation of…(intervention).      Yes page 67, the payment profile againstthe actual acceptance of locomotives and in this instance it reflects as noted on HJW1 payments to CNR of 1.1billion in the 2015 financial year, 573million in the 2016 financial year, there were no payments made in 2017 but in 2018, 21 locomotives were accepted, the first time that locomotives were accepted.      That’s correct yes.      Chair through you, and with reference to paragraph 36 of my affidavit on page 10, I’ve attached Annexure HJW12 which is the detailed payment listing of payments made to Bombardier in relation to the 1064 transaction, the payments cover three pages from pages 69 to 71 and the total payments made to Bombardier of6.2billion is reflected at the bottom right of  page 71, again Bombardier was also paid an amount of – amounts totalling 248million in relation to  relocation costs which is dealt with later.  So again the amount of 6.2billion is inclusive of the relocation costs, the amount exclusive of the relocation costs is therefore just over 6billion rand.      I – these invoices are referenced as item numbers 419 on page 69.      419 yes down to 501 on page 71 andagain I’ve taken the first item number being item number 419 and attached as Annexure HJW12 (A) the invoice received from Bombardier in relation to the payment being for Milestone One totalling an amount of R1 338 848 568.43 and I’ve attached as HJW12 (B) starting on page 74 and reflected on page 75 the SAP remittance advice for that payment of 1.338billion and again I’ve attached the chart in Annexure HJW13 reflecting payments made to Bombardier against locos accepted and in March 2015 payments totalling 2.681billion had been made to BT in the 2016 financial year a further 1.371billion was paid in the March 17 financial year 8 – just under 9million was paid and in  March – thefinancial year ended March 2018 we see that we accepted 10 locomotives and payment of just under 900million was made in that financial year.      Through you Chair, that’s correct yes.      Yes.      Correct yes.      Through you Chair, thank you, I’ve attached as Annexure HJW14 the payment listing, it was a bit grand for a single payment, but the payment listing for the payment made to China North Rail…(intervention).      That’s at my page 79.     And following the convention around numbering it, I’ve numbered it item number 400 and the total relocationcost there is reflected as 368million which reconciles to my HJW1 summary.  I’ve again, as the only line item, I’ve attached as Annexure HJW15 starting – no I haven’t.      My head went before my eyes, apologiesChair.  Because I’ve already attached an invoice from CNR and taken it through the process -  payment process I’ve simply reflected here separately for ease of reference the payments made to China North Rail, so my HJW15 then is similarly a detailed payment listing, it starts on page 80 and is reflected on page 81.  The payment listing for relocation costs made to Bombardier Transport.  In that instance it reflects from items numbers 427 to 471 and it totals R248 710 471.30 which again reconciles to my HJW1 summary.      Yes.      Yes.      That’s correct, through you Chair, but we do have it our volume 4.      Yes.      That’s correct yes.     That’s correct yes.      That’s correct yes.      Yes, Chair through you again, I haven’t attached an example.     But they are all contained in volume 4.      Yes.      That’s correct yes.      That’s correct.      Yes.      That’s correct yes.  Transaction advisors were specifically appointed in relation to the 1064 transaction and in terms of those appointments, payments were made to Regiments andMcKinsey as noted in para 42.1 305million was paid to Regiments and in para 42.2 McKinsey an amount of 11million rand was paid.     I’ve attached as HJW16 again a detailed listing of all payments, there isn’t a listing per advisor this listing is a consolidated listing and that’s reflected on pages 83 to 88 attached to my affidavit.       That’s correct yes.     That’s correct yes.      No in fact two points of clarification.      These are payments made – all payments made to Trillion as well as McKinsey and Regiments and relates to work provided to Transnet which included but was not limited to the 1064 advisory transaction and I think as noted later in my affidavit the additional information is provided in – to be transparent about the fees that were paid and not to limit the payments to 1064.      Chair yes, it would be since 2010 with the – almost, I’m not quite sure how to refer to it, the starting point of the investigation into the loco transaction.      Yes financial years.      That’s correct yes.     Between the three of them and over the nine financial years.    No.        That’s correct yes.      Correct yes.      Chair on – through you I have attached as Annexure HJW17 a – on pages 89 and 90 a summary of that detailed payment listing which also summarises what I’ve just said which is total listing made was in relation to a number of assignments, not limited to 64 and on that page 90 one can see that item – that line number 1 refers to the 1064 transaction advisory but there’s item numbers 2 to 18 which cover other work that was done by those service providers(indistinct) Transnet.  To that end the amounts that I note that were paid in my paragraph 42 of my affidavit are restricted to the amounts in line item1 on page 90 being my HJW17.      So to that end an amount of – as I saidpreviously an amount of 305million was paid to Regiments ad an amount of 11million paid to McKinsey again the invoices and the SAP payment advices are not attached to my affidavit but are included in volume 5 of the documents that we’ve submitted and again I’m happy to find those and make those available.      Yes.      That’s right.    The amounts on page 90…(intervention).          Correct, yes correct.    McKinsey yes.  According to our – to the accounting records which I have accessed in order to provide all of this information McKinsey was not paid for transaction advisory services and that is reflected on the – on my page 90 the summary.  HoweverMcKinsey in email correspondence with Transnet advised to a recipient of the two invoices relating to it that the invoices were in relation to the 64 locomotive procurement transaction.  So I have included it as such but it is not disclosed as a payment in 1064 transaction advisory on page 90 it is actually included under line item 3 being Swat 1 that is where the payment was allocated according to Transnet’s accounting records.    Yes.   Yes.    The amount was paid yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.   Swat 1 it is just – it was just a – it is a project that was being done for Transnet and the word Swat was chosen.   It is not an acronym.    That is correct yes.    No.    Yes.  We could ask either the process owner that allocated it or look at the invoices and determine if the – the process owner would be the appropriate person.    That I can do through you Chair.    That is correct yes.    Thank you through you Chair yes.  Albeit that the…    Yes.    Notwithstanding that the payment listing that we referred to in HJW16.    Dated from 2010 Transnet has looked at all payments made to the named suppliers and to this end we noted that payments were made by Transnet to Regiments as – in 2005 and that payments were made to McKinsey in 2006 and dates following.  My HJW18 therefore is a chart reflecting to the best of our knowledge andgoing back into our records as far as the systems allow reflects payments made to these entities outside of or before the 1064 transaction advisory and transactions.    That is correct yes.    Yes.  So     The chart – the chart consolidates a lot of information.    It shows that payments were made to Regiments and or Trillian.   From in the top chart 2005 through to 17 which one would expect.  It also reflects the specific operating division in Transnet that made the payments being Transnet Freight Rail reflected as TFR in the slide, Transnet Group Capital reflected as TGC and Transnet Group Services which is reflected as TGS.    And what the slide does is it shows the total payments made per financial year.    Again from April to March of each financial year and then below that it shows the payments made to each legal entity across all of those financial years.  So one can see that when we make reference to Regiments and Trillian it is Regiments Capital, Trillian Capital Partners, Trillian Asset Management and RegimentsCapital PTY Limited.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    And a similar exercise was done forMcKinsey.    In other words not just from 2010 and that is contained in my annexure HJW19 and…    Page 94 in particular which reflects payments made by Transnet to McKinsey starting in 2006.    That is correct yes.   That is correct yes.    That is McKinsey yes.   Correct yes.    I do just want to point out that there is duplication.   There is duplication.    Because of the overlap of the financial years.    So you do read them together but there would – you need to just track the financial years and make sure they are not double counted.    No.    No.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.   Yes.    Yes if I may?    The HJW18.    Was a consolidation across the different Transnet business units.  HJW19, 20 and 21 simply break that downacross the three divisions that are reflected on HJW18 being Freight Rail, Group Capital and Group Services.  It is just a breakdown.    Yes and that is Trans – payments made byTransnet Port Terminals.    To McKinsey.    Getting there.  Yes I am there Chair through you.    Correct yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    And 5 cents yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes Chair.    Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you Chair through you.  As I noted regarding payments prior to January 2010 which are – is included in the information provided I am personally not aware of any investigations in respect thereto and the outcomes if any and the information is being provided as I noted earlier for completeness.    I do yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    Yes.    Yes.   No.    Chair through you no thank you very much we have covered everything.    Thank you Chair.

WALSH:No Chair, unfortunately the…(intervention). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.   Thank you Chair.    Francis Quentin Callard.    No.    I do.    So help me God.   (duly sworn, states)    Yes.    Fine.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Sorry.  Paragraph?   26?  Ja.    Five?    Yes.    Yes.    These were from CSR.    Yes.    Yes.    Which he did.    Yes.    YL24.    Page 45.    Page …    It is BB4F.    Certainly.  Well as Mr Laher says that Mr Singh requested that he personally prepare a reasonability calculation on the expected price of the 20E that was purchased from CSR in October 2012 adjusting for the 2012 price for inflation, forex movements and any other items that would impact the price.  He arrives at a calculated figure of approximately 44 million.If we may now look at page 45.  He gives an analysis of how he arrived at that price.  Firstly …    It is Annexure YL24 …   And it is page 45 …    Of the bundle.    In – in the first block the – the    He then puts this – some first figures in a – in a block which he indicates first the Rand portion of the locomotive.  Then he has a US portion of $1 950 000.  Then he has two figures.  One a rate used by CSR 7.4 and I interpret this as that was the Dollar rate used by CSR in their calculation and then he has a rate at the date of signature of 22 October 2012 at 8.635. It is my understanding that this relates to a comment that he made in – in his statement where believed that the rate of exchange was excessive and in that I would like to point out to item 31 of hisstatement.    Certainly.  Right, thank you.    And from that he calculates at thelast line in that block a calculated exchange rate impact.  He gives us a base price of the locomotive and then he adds various elements, exchange rate, escalation on the Dollar portion, escalation on the South African portion, additional set up costs, hedging costs.  He adds duty, a price excluding options. He then adds options of pneumatically controlled braking and Wire Distributed Power that is the WDT and he comes to a price including options of 41 099 733.  So it is 41.1 million to all intents and purposes.  May – and …    It would be my understanding …    That this would be the total price of a locomotive fit for purpose ready for use.    That is correct because the base price of the locomotive certainly which we had in the business case ex – included the necessary options over and above the manufacturersoffered price that would be required to render a locomotive fit for purpose.    Correct it is my …    Understanding of his calculations, yes.    Correct.    Manner of calculation, yes.    I agree with the methodology.    Yes.    Agreed, yes.    Yes.    That is …  I looked at his statement accordingly, yes.    Yes I have one comment and in that I would like to refer to Mr Laher’s original first statement …    Hm.    It is page 14 of his …    1-4 of his statement BBF – BB4F.1.    And I would read verbatim from his…    Paragraph 54.    Ja.    The first statement.  Correct.    And his paragraph 54.    I would read verbatim from his paragraph. “The impression I gained during the negotiations was that the Chairperson’s negotiation tactic wasvery much focused on the overall price and not focused on the detailed elements that made up the price such as for example escalation, batch pricing etcetera.  Even though the detailed elements may have been spoken about at various times during the negotiations it appeared not to be Singh and Jiyane’s main focus.  The effect of this was that as much as these components were self-standing components of the negotiations in the end it was the overall price that the Chairperson focused on. The Subcommittee made the final decision on pricing.”    Yes.    Well I would then further take us to another statement and I would jump to this one too.  Mr Laher’s statement – his paragraph 33 on page 6 of his second statement.    This is in his second statement.    Paragraph 33.    Page 6.    And I would again quote verbatim from his statement. “In 2014 post the negotiation process …”    “…Mr Singh explained to me the principle elements of items he would likeincluded in a memorandum detailing the reasons of why the price had increased from the business case submission.  He explained to me the detail of the format in which he wanted the numbers presented.  Mr Singh requested that I type these into a draft ofthe memorandum prepared by the Transnet Group Capital Department.”    My conclusion …    That I interpret from this reading the first statement in context the Chairperson was focus – that there was a focus on the final price.  That there was the detail which made up that price was of lesser significance.  We have seen the range of theprices which were involved that was the 38.5 million and the 49 million.  Finally agreed price of 44 million. Post event Mr Laher is now asked to justify - come up with reasons as to why the price of 44 million was (intervenes).    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct, correct.    Correct.    I cannot …    Find an explanation of that difference.  He does mention that he said to Mr Singh that the escalation – the escalation used – correction.    Exchange rate.    But I can – do not find acalculation which supports that.  I cannot find an explanation of the difference - why the difference between the price which he calculated …    And the price which was finallyagreed on.    The 44.    I am available tomorrow Chair.    I am available tomorrow to continue if need be.    Certainly.    I understand.    Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLRD:  Which may be found on – in support and amplification of that his first statement would be his paragraph 28… 
CAIRPERSON:  Hm.
