CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Are we ready?    Okay.      Yes.      Thank you.     Yes.  You may proceed.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay.    Okay.    Oh okay.  You are present?  Yes.  Okay thank you.  Oh I think he forgot.  Ja maybe for the sake of completeness if there are other Counsel you can just indicate or they can just place themselves on record.    Just switch on the microphone.  Yes. ADV    Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.      No there is not.  You see when Mr Nguckaitobi was talking, I could not see where he was talking from.    But that is because I think this light puts him in a dark…    Ja.  But I do not think much can be done about the light and he does not need to move.  You do not need to shift Mr Nguckaitobi it is okay.  It is just that I took some time trying to see where the voice was coming from.  Okay alright.    Okay.  Let us continue.    The [b] one is a smaller one?    Yes.      Are you talking about the red and the black ha?    Okay.    Before you do that …    Do you want me to admit this affidavit because she has confirmed that she – it is her signature there on the affidavit is it not and that this is her affidavit previously commissioned?    Do you want me to admit that?    Do you request that it be admitted and marked as Exhibit what U18?    Or U18[a]?    Hm.    18.1    The affidavit of Ms Suzanne Margaret Daniels appearing at page 1 and deposed to on the 17 August 2020 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit U18.1    Okay.  And then we will admit the others as we go along.    Okay.    Let us do that?    Okay.    And where is it again?    Page 50?   The supplementary affidavit of Ms Suzanne Margaret Daniels appearing at page 50 and deposed to on – what is the date again?    On the 1 September.    On the 1 September 2020 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit U?    U18.2.  Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    The – Ms Suzanne Daniels’ statement appearing at 50 – at page 58 will be admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit U18.3.    84.    The transcript of the evidence of Ms Suzanne Daniels before the Portfolio Committee in Parliament will be admitted and marked Exhibit U18.4.    Okay.    Admitted with – as we go along.    Okay.    Mr Seleka.    Are you going to – I [00   Because she has given evidence under oath in Parliament.    We have got the transcript in front of us.    She is – we have got her statement in Parliament, we have got two statements from her but that you will focus on certain issues.    Ja.    Oh okay.    Well the statement says in 2011 senior manager office of the Group Executive in 2011.    The relevant page.    Yes.    Yes you can just – you can just say what it says without looking at it if you do not read it.    When he told you that?    Yes.  Okay.  The – okay Mr Seleka.    Mr Seleka take it from there.    When you – do you recall when it was that you started sending or receiving emails to Businessman or infoportal email address?    Yes that is the – that is the one that you regard as the first?    Yes.  Now prior to Dr Ngubane forwarding that email to you had you not had any – have you not sent any emails to Businessman or infoportal that address – that email address?    Yes.    And had you received any – have you not received any emails from that email address?    Yes.  But had you become aware of them before Dr Ngubane forwarded that one to you?    Sorry.    Yes but…    So you were – had them.     Yes.  And when would that have been as you recall?  Obviously, I am not looking for an exact date but I want to have an idea of when it was, month and year or roundabout which month.     Late 2015?     I think from the... on the day that Dr Ngubane was giving evidence, I think reference was made to, if I am not mistaken, some emails that may have happened, somewhere mid-year 2015 around July/June if I am not mistaken.      And there is one for September but my recollection is that before the September one, there was one or more earlier than September 2015.  Does anything earlier than December sound like something you know nothing about?     Yes.   Yes. So you ... but whatever communications you had with this Businessman Info Portal that you sent to whoever was on the other end, is the position, that some of the emails that you sent to this email address, you sent on your own but others you sent because Dr Ngubane asked you to send them?   Or is the position that all the emails that you sent were sent because you made the decision to send them, you were not asked by anybody to send them?     Ja.  Okay, maybe it will be better that Mr Seleka goes to the... to each one of those emails.     So we can... you can also have a look at them and have ...[intervenes]  ADV SELEKA     ...to refresh your memory.     No, I am saying so that she can refresh her memory as well.     Did you say 944?     944?   So is your recollection that in September 2015, that was the first time you became aware of this email address of Businessman of Info Portal or were you already aware of it?     You cannot remember whether it was the first time you became aware of this email address?     In September 2015?     Yes.  But it would seem here that on the 28 September 2015, Dr Ngubane forwarded to you documents that had come from that email address, Businessman.     That is right.  And you do recall this occasion?     Yes, yes.  Do you recall what you did with them after receiving them?     Or what he wanted you to do with them?     You would have...?     So the document in... at... appearing at page 945 was prepared by you?     And that goes up to... is...      946.  Is that where it ends?     Okay.  Yes, Mr Seleka.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.  So let us just make sure we have a complete understanding of the documents that were attached to Businessman’s email to Dr Ngubane.  One, you say it is the document appearing at page 948.  Is that right?     That is a draft letter which is meant to be addressed to “the board”.  Is that right?     Yes.  Now, when... that was the one document.  Is there another document that was attached to Businessman’s email that he directed to Dr Ngubane or as this the only document that was attached?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     With City Press, Mail & Guardian and Sunday Times?     Yes.  What other document was attached?     A letter from the chairperson of the Transnet Board.   Ja, addressed to the minister ...[intervenes]      Of Public Enterprises.  Yes, what else was attached?     So this document... this draft at page 948, was it also part of... was it also attached?     A resolution of the Transnet Board.     Yes, okay. MS     Those were the two attachments?     Okay.  Mr Seleka, do we have them here in the bundle?     We do not have those two?     Okay alright.  Would you be able to facilitate getting them or you would not have access to anything?     Ja.     Whether you can find them, ja.  So ...[intervenes]      So this draft letter at page 948 which was meant for the company secretary to be addressed to the board and I think it was meant to be addressed to the boards of different SOE’s, how did it come... did it come to your attention at the time, around 28 September 2015?     Yes.     Sorry?     Yes, but who drafted this document?     This letter?     The one at page 948.     H’m?     You are not clear who drafted it?     And you were not company secretary at that time?     Okay.  But you say you became aware of it roundabout end of September?     Yes, okay.  But you cannot remember how it may have come to you?     From Dr Ngubane?     Oh, okay.  You recall what Dr Ngubane said you must do with it?     He asked you to prepare the document at page 945?     And attach the document at page 948 ...[intervenes]      ...to assist you?     Okay.  Did he speak about the document at page 948 in particular?     Yes.     Oh, to use that as a basis to prepare ...[intervenes]      ...the document at page 945?     And that is what you did?     And as a result, the document you prepared at 945 to 946 is... except for one or two differences, are basically identical to the one that he sent to you?     Yes.     But the substance is the same?     Ja.  Actually, most of it seems to be identical.     Ja.  Okay.  And what is the document at page 945?  Who was it addressed to and for what purpose?     Ja?     Yes and ...[intervenes]      And would it be correct that you prepared the document at page 945 in order to give effect or implement what is written in the document that Dr Ngubane... that you say Dr Ngubane sent to you which is at page 948?     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka.     Yes.  Okay, I think Mr Seleka, earlier on you wanted to either read ...[intervenes]      ...or ask the witness to read the document at page 948.  I think that is a good idea.     There might not be a need to read the one at 945.     Because she had said that that was meant to implement.     Or give effect to the document at page 948 that she had received from Dr Ngubane.     But I think let us have that one read into the record.     So that the... whoever is listening or viewing, can understand the context of the two... or the contents of the two documents.     [No audible reply]     What was your understanding of what that was?     But it is written as sister apostrophe s state-owned.     [laughing]  It does not say sister companies or sister state-owned companies.     It says sisters.     [No audible reply]      Did you understand that you had to reproduce it like that, exactly as it is?     Yes.     So what is that you cannot recall?     Oh, but I thought you said earlier on, you prepared the document at page 945?     Ja?     Yes.     But you may have had different versions.   But whatever version this one is ...[intervenes]      ...quite clearly, it is taken from the document at page 948.     Yes.   Ja, I think what Mr Seleka was highlighting is that you appeared to have just taken it as it is in the true sense including how they formulated what they must have intended was misled the public.  Continue, Mr Seleka.     Oh, unless it was... unless they meant to say has misled.  Or would that make sense Mr Seleka or not really?  No, then the two after misled would not...     [laughing]     Ja, okay yes.     [laughing]     [laughing]  Ja.     Apart from that, also the document at     Do you remember whether it was you?     But would you have prepared the document at 945 without reading the document at 948?  I am saying prepared, maybe it is not prepared, it is just electronically – just put it on to create exactly the same document and change here and there.  Would you have done that without reading it and applying your mind to it?     Sorry?     Yes but Dr Ngubane, as I understand it, sent the document at page 948 to you, is that right?     And he must have either given you instructions about what to do with it or there was an understanding between the two of you as to what you should do with it, is that right?     What was that instruction or what was that understanding.       The document [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes and that is what you did.     So my question is, would you have done that without reading the document at page 948?     You would have read it?     Yes, do you remember whether you made the changes that Mr Seleka and I have referred to on the part relating to resolution?     You cannot recall.     Yes.     Yes, now you said that you remember that the email that Dr Ngubane forwarded to you on the 28 September came with a letter from the Chairperson of the Transnet board to Minister Brown as well as – you say resolution?     A resolution but you say you do not know whether it also came – that is the email from Dr Ngubane to you, you do not remember whether it came with the document at page 948?     Yes.     Yes, but you are saying the end you got it from Dr Ngubane.     Yes.  Would you know whether it is a document that he drafted, Dr Ngubane, the document at page 948?     It is not the kind of document that he would drafted?     He gave evidence before me to the effect that he normally did not prepare his speech, his own speeches.  I do not know what else he said he did not prepare, he would have those prepared for him.  Is that to your knowledge the correct thing that he did not prepare his speeches as well?     Oh, I think media statements was the other one, ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Media statement or speech.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Changes.     Yes but you say he would not have prepared this document himself, this draft at page 948.     Yes, why do you say that?  What is the basis for saying that?     So would it have been prepared by somebody within Transnet or the …[intervenes]     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka, it is just that I cannot remember, I thought I was under the impression that Dr Ngubane accepted that this document came with emails from a businessman but I cannot be sure, I do not know what your recollection is.     He did, ja.     Yes, okay.0758     Ja.     Yes.  Okay, alright.       Continue.     Is it your understanding of the document at page 948 that whoever drafted it was saying that the board of Eskom must take a certain stand against the three newspapers mentioned in that document, namely City Press, The Mail & Guardian – Mail Garden – the Mail & Garden …[intervenes]     And Sunday Times.     Is that your understanding as well, that that person was saying the board of Eskom must take a certain stand and actually the boards of other SOEs must do t6he same against the newspaper. MS     Yes and that this was to be in response to certain articles that were said to have been published in those newspapers about SOEs.     Yes.     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka?     But also just going back – I am sorry, Mr Seleka, going back to my question.  So you have a situation where somebody – and if Dr Ngubane’s evidence is correct and probably – well, it certainly seems to be, if somebody using the businessman email address had drafted this letter, this document at page 948, that person wanted the Eskom board to take a certain position against those newspapers.  Dr Ngubane gave you the document at page 948 and asked you to prepare the document at 945 which would ask the board of Eskom to adopt exactly the position that whoever had drafted the letter at page 948 wanted to be adopted by the Eskom board.     You accept that?     Yes.  And on your understanding the person who drafted this, would that person have been within Eskom or outside of Eskom or is that something you do not know?     This is somebody who was external to Eskom at the time.     Okay.  Mr Seleka?     And was it strange to you that the Chairperson of the board, I think he had been confirmed as Chairperson at the time, Dr Ngubane, in September 2015, was it strange to you that the Chairperson was asking you to prepare resolution that would be adopted the board on the basis of a document that came from outside Eskom or was that not strange, that was something normal?     You did not …[intervenes]     Yes, okay.     Ja, okay.     Well, I see we are at quarter past, Mr Seleka.     Ja, let us take the tea adjournment.  Am I wrong to think that there were other emails that you referred Dr Ngubane to from businessmen that happened  before September in 2015?     Oh, is it June 2016?     Oh, okay, okay.  So on what we have, September 2015 appears to be the earliest we have …[intervenes]     Oh, okay.     Oh, okay, okay.  We will take the tea adjournment, we will resume at twenty five to twelve.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Let us continue.     I think so.    It was?      That is assuming that the email at the bottom of page 944 from Businessman to Dr Ngubane, was the first one?     And also, assuming that you had not received any email from Businessman prior to that?    You are able to say you had not received any emails or sent any emails – you had not received any mails from and had not sent emails to Businessman before that email at the bottom of page 944 that came from Businessman and was directed to Dr Ngubane?       Okay, Mr Seleka?     And I think Kimberley Davids is, understood to have been someone working in the office of the Minister of Public Enterprises, Minister Brown, I don’t know whether as a PA or as something else but it is understood to be somebody who was working in Minister Brown’s office.     Hm?     She was the Executive Assistant, okay and you knew – at the time that you were working at Eskom in 2015/2016 did you know her to use this email address of anckimcwc@gmail.com?      Oh, but you knew that Kimberley Davids was Minister Brown’s Executive Assistant?     Okay, so it appears that Mr Richard Seleke sent to infoportal1@soho.com on 21 June 2015, his CV to that email address and that on the same day in the evening, Businessman or somebody from that address – email address then forwarded – sent an email to Ms Kimberley Davids in the office of Minister Brown, saying, enclosing the CV of Mr Richard Seleke and saying, this is the candidate for DG and DG would be Director General and asking whether it would be possible for madam to meet Mr Seleke on Tuesday.  I take it madam refers to Minister Brown, Mr Seleka, I think you had put a question to the witness but I just, summarised what appears at page 1042.     But do you or do you not accept that on the face of it, it appears that the person who forwarded Mr Richard Seleke’s CV to Ms Kimberley Davids appears to be somebody other than Mr Richard Seleke himself?     Is there any chance that you could be mistaken about that and that maybe you told him?     Sorry?    You are quite clear that you did not tell him or it could be that you told him but you can’t remember, what is the position?      Yes, the fact that the emails from Businessman from info portal happened or Mr Seleke was appointed as DG of the Department of Public Enterprises would mean that if it was him at that time it would be very strange because, to your knowledge, to our knowledge he had nothing to do with DPE or with Eskom at the time before his appointment to DPE.     Okay, Mr Seleka?    You may continue.      Have you double checked what the last number was?  Was it not 18.3?    Okay.    Now this one that you want to be admitted is at what page?    Yes.     You want us to start at 874?    Hm.    yes.    You have dealt with these emails under – during Dr Ngubane’s evidence.    Yes they were there they should have been admitted there.    And they have to retain that Exhibit number throughout because otherwise you – you will have confusion.  Same documents are in different bundles and different bundles are known as – with – by different names.  So I think that is what we should do either now or later maybe during lunch break you can have a look.    Ja.  Also that we do no.    So that they can be admitted where they primarily belong and then reference to them can be made to whatever bundle they are deemed.    And the exhibit numbers relating to them can be used.    Ja.    Ja.  No that is fine you can continue.    You were called by whom?    Yes okay.    Hm.    Did Mr Koko tell you to go to that restaurant?    Yes.    Okay, alright so he did not tell you where exactly at Melrose Arch you should go but once you were there you went into this restaurant.    Ja okay.    When he asked you to go to Melrose Arch did he say why?    He wanted to talk to you about?    Certain matters.    Is that what he said?    Okay.    As you were going to this building he still had not told you what – where you were going and what matters you had to discuss?    Yes.    Yes.    This would have been around about what time of the day or evening?    Yes.    Around about lunch time.    Okay.    Hm.    Is that what he said?    Okay.  Continue.    There would be an inquiry where?    Yes.    Hm.    Just repeat that?    He said certain people would not return?    Did you ask him who he was talking about?    Hm.    What was your understanding of who the people were that he was talking about when he said certain people would not return and what was your understanding of where he was saying they would not return to?    Yes.  Okay.  Continue.  So you said you looked at Mr Koko after hearing that his name was included by Mr Salim Essa.    Among the executives who would be suspended and he looked unfazed?    Did he say keep quiet – did he say…    He raised his hand to you.    In a manner that you understood to be …    Okay.  Alright.  So he was not shocked by this revelation?    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    He said what about coming days?    Oh okay.     Hm.   Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.      Did Mr Koko remain behind?    Yes.  Now I may be mistaken I did not seem to – I do not seem to remember reading in your statement that Mr Salim Essa said at that meeting that some people would not return.  Do you know whether you did include that part?    Hm.  Why not?    Yes it is just that it is an important part of the conversation is it not – was it not?    Just like the suspension – the first is certain people would be suspended and you are told the names of the people who would suspended that came as a shock to you; you have told me.  But it must also have come as even greater shock that some people would not return if that – if you understood that to refer to the same people who would be suspended?  Because it would mean the idea was that they would be suspended but they would part ways with Eskom?    What did you understand him to mean when he said…    I am sorry –     We should not speak at the same time.  What did you understand when he said some people will not return?  I thought you said you understood that to be a reference to the – at least some of the executives who – who would be suspended?    Yes.    Hm.    What were you not clear about?    Ja but I asked you earlier on when you said he said some people would not return.  I asked you what your understanding was of who he was referring to and my recollection is that you said your understanding was that he was referring to the people who would be suspended.    No Ms Daniels we were speaking just maybe ten minutes ago or maybe fifteen or twenty.  You said Mr Salim Essa said to you some people will not return.  And then I asked you what your understanding was of who he was talking about when he said, some people would not return. And my recollection is that you said he was talking – your understanding was that he was talking about the people who would be suspended or at least some of them.  Is my recollection of your evidence incorrect?    Hm.    Sorry.    It would have been reference to all of them?    Yes.  Now my question is, how could you not include that part in your statement namely that he said some people would not return because if anything it seems to me to be even much more important than his statement that they would be suspended. Because it meant that they would part ways with Eskom.    Hm.    Did you include it in your statement to the Portfolio Committee in Parliament?    Did you – did you include it in your oral evidence before the Portfolio Committee?    But how could you have not remembered on so many occasions over such a long period of time something so important that here was this person from outside Eskom that you were meeting under very strange circumstances it seems to me from what you have said telling you that certain executives from Eskom and he mentioned them by name would be suspended and would not return to Eskom.  How could you remember that he said they would be suspended but you did not remember that he said they would not return?  Because it seems to me to be equally important if not even more important than the fact that they would be suspended.    Yes.    Yes.    Are those notes that you made at the meeting with Mr Salim Essa and Mr Koko?    Yes but do those notes include this piece of important information namely that Mr Essa told you that some of the people would not return to Eskom?    Ja but did they include that or did they not include that?    Yes.  Mr Seleka.    He said what?    I thought earlier on you said he said to you he wanted to discuss some matters with you?    Did he say when you asked him why I will let you know or did he say there are some matters I want to discuss with you?    Okay.  Mr Seleka.     It would have been even more strange if he did not tell you what he wanted to discuss with you outside of Eskom, is that not so?     Yes.  And it would have been even stranger when, after meeting you at the restaurant where you were waiting for him, he took you and you walked to some offices and still he did not tell you on the way to those offices.  Is that right?     Yes.  And when you came to this board room and you said he still did not tell you, you waited for somebody to come in.  Is that right?     So you must have found all of this quite strange?     Yes.  Okay, Mr Seleka.       Had you been to that restaurant before?     Many times?     A few times?     Once?     Okay.     What he says happened did not happen insofar as he says the two of you did not move to any other place.  You spoke at that restaurant and that he spoke to you about his written suspension.  Is that right?  So you say that is not true?     Yes.     Did he ever speak to you about what he is saying on another occasion and not on this occasion?     Ja.     Ja.     Okay.  Before I forget this point which I should have asked earlier on.  Now, when you left this meeting, the boardroom where you met with mister... you and Mr Koko met with Mr Essa on your version, did you still ask     And what did he say?     What was your understanding of what the purpose is for you being brought there to meet with Mr Essa?     But my question is whether you were able, after the meeting, to understand for yourself what the purpose of that meeting was or whether you did not seek to     Did you look at... did you, having regard to what was discussed, did you analyse and conclude why you were brought there or did you not do that?     Asked him...?     Yes?     Yes.     Now from what you have told me in regard to the content of the discussion in that meeting while Mr Essa was there.  It seems that there are two issues that he raised with you.   One, he asked you what process or what is to be done at Eskom if somebody needs to be suspended.  And two, he told you that certain people were to suspended and he gave their names.  Is there something else of importance that I am missing out that he told you?     Those are the two things?     Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.     That people would do what?     Did Mr Koko... or let me put it... how was your relationship with Mr Koko at the time?     Yes, okay.     Well, I guess that assuming that you had no interactions with Mr Salim Essa or the Gupta’s, anybody from the Gupta’s or their associates, Mr Koko could bring you to such a meeting if he thought that he could trust you that you would be one, helpful to Mr Essa and two, that you would not disclose maybe this meeting or what was discussed at this meeting to other people.  Would you think he had that trust in you?     Just repeat that.     And who is we?     Oh, okay.  Mr Seleka.     Well, it seems to me Ms Daniels that unless there is something else that comes out, you may have been trusted to be the person who would cooperate in this context. And that you would be able to advise Mr Essa as to how at Eskom you go about if you want to suspend somebody but that you would also keep the discussions at the meeting confidential.   Because they would not call you to that meeting just to tell you that certain people would be suspended.  What would you do with that information?     Mr Seleka.     I am sorry Mr Seleka.  I think it is necessary for the sake of completeness to also deal with her evidence about what happened after that meeting and the following day because I think she said she called certain people.     Yes.     Ja.     Oh, okay.  No, that is fine.     Is that a yes?     Yes, you see that?     Yes.     Go home or go back to work?  Did you go home or back to work?     Ja.     Yes.     He knew of him?     Yes.     He worked in...?     Government circles?     Ja.     Minister who?     Ja.     H’m.     Yes.     Well, I did not see the name of your friend.  Is there a particular reason you might want to tell us who your friend is?     What is his name?     Dr Mohammed?     Justin Mohammed?     Ja.     Page 31?     Oh, okay.     Okay.  Okay alright.  So you phoned him on your way from this meeting with Mr Essa and Mr Koko and before your office?     Okay.  Did you go to the office and then went home?  I thought you said you went back to work.     You did not go back to work?     Oh, okay.  Roundabout what time was it when you left that meeting?     About what time?     Sorry?     About three in the afternoon?     Was not yet heavy?     Okay.  I think you said you... you say you got Mr Koko’s call around lunch time or did you say you met him at the restaurant around lunch time?     Yes, but did not want him to...     Yes, okay alright.  So from the meeting you went home?     So on your way home, you called your friend?     And in that conversation you just asked him... you asked him whether Mr Essa could deliver what he said he... what he said?     Yes.  But what he had said?  He could do or could not do?     Yes.     Yes.  But he was not going to be the one doing the suspensions, is it not?     So what were you talking about when you asked your friend whether Mr Essa could do what he said he could do?  He never said he would suspend the people.     H’m?     Yes but what was the impression that you got?     He would be able to?     Arrange the suspensions?     Okay, that is what you were talking about.     To get them suspended.    Okay, alright.  So – and your friend’s response was probably he would be able to do what he said he would do?     But did your friend know what you were talking about?     You did not tell him?     Did you subsequently tell him?     But did he never ask you what are you talking about, what did Mr Essa say he would do?     But that is strange.  You are my friend, I get a call from you, you say to me can so and so do what he says he can do.  I respond and say yes.  I do not know what it is you are talking about, what it is that he said he would do and then I do not ask questions during the telephone conversation.  I do not phone you up later on and say what were you talking about?     You agree with me that it is strange?  Unless the two of you had  full understanding of what it was, that is why he would not – he did not need to ask you.     But what was the purpose of your call to your friend then?     That is all you wanted to find out?     And you found it out?     Even though your friend did not know you were talking about Mr Essa getting people suspended?     It is very strange to me, Ms Daniels.     Mr Seleka, I do not know if you have one or two questions before we take the lunch break or whether we should take it straightaway?     Okay, we are going to take the lunch break.  The time is ten past one, we will resume at ten past two.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Let us continue.     Tell us first how it was?     I am sorry, he – how did you meet, did you call you, did somebody call you, a meeting was set up?  Where was it set up, what did he want to talk to you about?  Give me all the information.     Mr Salim Essa called you?     Ja and said what?     I am sorry, just go back again.  He called you – tell me, he called you and said what?  Did he say Brian Molefe matter?  What did he say exactly?     Yes that is now Mr Salim Essa?      And this was 2017?     Late July.  Was this only the second time you were talking to him after the meeting at Melrose Arch or had you spoken to him or had communication with him in the meantime?     Yes.     Yes and when was that?     Ja.  2015, 2016, 2017?     Early 2017?     Okay.     Ja, just tell me about that second meeting before you go to the July one.     So that second meeting which you had with Mr Salim Essa was arranged by Mr Koko?     Okay.  What did Mr Koko say to you to make the arrangement?     To discuss the IPPs.     This is early in…?     2017.  And you went along.     And where was this meeting held?     Oh and he had not told you that were going to go Melrose Arch?     Did he say where the meeting was going to be held?     To Pretoria.     Okay, so you went to Melrose Arch.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, talking about Mr Koko?     Yes.     Yes.     So you did not go to see Minister Brown?     Did you ask him what happened to the meeting with Mr Brown that you said we were going to?     Yes.  So he asked you to come along, said that the two of you were going to meet with Minister Brown but took you to Melrose Arch, kept you outside of the boardroom, had a meeting with Mr Salim Essa inside the boardroom, came out of the boardroom or the meeting and drove back with you to Eskom?     That is quite strange too, is it not?     But for all intents and purposes from your version it looks like he did not need you to come along?     So why would he take you along when he did not need you, let you impact your work and then take you not to a meeting, take you to outside a boardroom and have a meeting with somebody else inside?     What power play?     But how would taking you to this meeting but you are sitting outside the boardroom show that he was in charge?     Ms Daniels, this does not make sense to me.     He just takes you – I mean, you must have had a lot of important work to do, he takes you, he says come along, we are going to see Mr Brown, does not take you to Minister Brown, he takes you to Melrose Arch, makes you wait outside the boardroom, has a meeting with somebody, when he is finished he says okay, let us go back to Eskom.     Did you ask him why did you bring me here?     H’m?     But did you ask him?     And the first time around when he took you to Melrose Arch to meet with Mr Essa, I think you asked something and you say – you said he shrugged his shoulders.     Okay.     Anyway, so that was the second meeting and then was the next meeting you had with Mr Essa the one towards the end of July 2017?  Or was there another one before that?     When was it?     Yes.  What was that one about?   Or, Mr Seleka, is that something that is deferred to next time Ms Daniels comes back?     Ja, it does not matter.     I just want to see your interactions with the Guptas or their associates.     Ja.     Ja.     That is June 2017?     Okay.     So how did that meeting come about?     Oh, you mean that is the meeting …[intervenes]     Where you were dealing with the report from the …[intervenes]     Ja.  Okay, alright.     Who?     Oh, yes, ja, it pulls up next to you.     Ja.     At the garage?     At the filling station.     The what?     Okay.     At the meeting that you had with the risk and audit committee?     Yes, which was a telephonic meeting, you said.     So he could recite exactly what you had said at the meeting?     Ja.     You can refresh your memory if there is something that you want to…     Okay, that was your third meeting.     With him.  And then the next one was the one towards the end of July?     This encounter, this third meeting, have you included it in any statements that you have made?     But was it in a statement that you submitted to parliament.     Ja, but was it in the statement because I do not seem to remember seeing it.     And then in July, how did the one that happened in July 2017 come about?       Who called you?     Yes?     Yes, that is about how long after your third meeting with him?     Yes.     You said?     Yes.  The matter was in court.     Yes.     At his office?     Ja, okay.     This is now before you could have the coffee that he said you should have?     Okay, so were you now going to an apartment?     You did not ask where you were going to have this coffee?     Mr Seleka I know you wanted to come to this meeting but I want to be clear about the other meetings as well.            This is around early 2017?     You are saying that you did not believe at that time that the board was bona fide?     Continue Mr…[intervene]     The State of Capture Report?      Which was released at the end of October 2016.      Ja.      That is prior to the reports?     Ja – being made, released.      Which member of the board said that to you?                              Yes.      Oh, if it is a matter that in respect of which no 33 notice has been sent out she can tell me next time but she must tell me at some stage.       There is no 33 notice that has gone out?      Oh.      Okay, alright.  Do not tell me now but you will tell me next time.       Okay, alright so one of the board members said that to you?     This is now; it is still that same meeting Mr Seleka?     That you are talking about.      Go back to the meeting that Mr Seleka asked you about.   MS     As to?      Oh okay alright, ja.       Okay then respond to that first.      Okay, continue Mr Seleka.      No, Ms Daniels you could not have gone there out of curiosity no, you could not.       I mean this is the man that told you in 15 about executives that he said would be suspended and you were shocked because he is not part of Eskom.  And upon your version Mr Koko could not explain why he brought you there, you were unhappy about that and now you say about two years later he calls you over a weekend you agreed to go where he wants you to go because you are curious.      Yes.       All the more reason why you should not have nothing to do with him and you say after that, after he has offered you R800million, corruption.  You say he called you over a weekend, you agreed to go and meet him because you are curious.       Sorry?     You should not be wanting to talk to that person after that Ms Daniels.  You should not be wanting to take his calls after he has offered you R800million to do something wrong.  You should not be wanting to talk to that person, you should not be taking his calls.  If you had his number, you have saved his number you should block his number.  Is it not?  So what are you doing going to meet with him over a weekend, out of curiosity?         Continue Mr Seleka.      But you were offered…[intervene]     Does that make any difference?       Does that make any difference to the fact that that was corruption?       Yes, but in offering you if that is true that was corruption.  In offering you that money in order for you to do wrong.  Was it not?      So does the fact that they were making this offer in desperation make any difference?       So you had then, you had some understanding of why they were offering you R800million?      And you could understand what they were doing?      They wanted to get Mr Koko to be CEO?     Yes, that is Mr Essa saying that?     Mr Seleka.     Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes ja.    So that it can be served on the…    On the relevant – affected parties.    Ja okay.    That is like somebody outside of the Board is effective in controlling what the Board – decisions the Board may or should take in regard to those newspapers.    Ja.   And he said this is the position you must take and they adopt that position.    Hm.     And certainly in relation to the email that contained the – a draft of what position the Board should take with regard to the City Press, Sunday Times and the Mail and Guardian the Chairperson did not take exception to this whole thing that somebody from outside is sending him a draft of what the Board should – what position the Board should take, is that right?    He did not object to that?    Instead he said you – you must prepare a resolution based on that draft?    Okay.    But you were – you attended the one of the 9t h March did you not?    Oh I thought I read something – I read your – oh maybe I misread [mumbling].  Okay.    No it was somebody else’s in here.    Hm.  Okay.      We compiled – once we – once we had – there were draft minutes so once we had put them together in the necessary format each Board Member received a pack and each Board Member was given the opportunity to comment on whether we had correctly captured those minutes.  And once that had been done I then prepared a pack for Mr – Dr Ngubane and it was actually first approved at one of the Board meetings before he signed them off.    Hang on Mr Seleka.  Okay please continue.    And how much was that are you able to remember?    Okay.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine.    My recollection may be inaccurate Mr Seleka.  I got the impression that what he said that is Dr Ngubane when he gave evidence that he gone to the CCMA on his own and not because he was representing the Board.    That was my impression.    Yes.  Yes    Yes, yes.    Yes and I think I – I do recall that I think Mr Matona said Dr Ngubane was part of the Board’s delegation or representatives.    In regard to the negotiations with him    But that I think Dr Ngubane when he gave evidence seemed to deny that.  I hope I am – my recollection is accurate.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja I will not read it now but if you tell me that it is there that is enough for me.    Ja because that is my recollection that he…    Said he went to the CCMA.    On his own he was not representing the Board.    And that he said he was not involved.    In the negotiations with Mr Matona.    Ja.  Ja.    Oh then my recollected was incorrect.    Ja in terms of what he said on the witness stand.    But are you reading from his affidavit?    So his affidavit says he was tasked by the Board.    To go to the CCMA.    But in the witness stand he said he went there on his own.  Okay.    Hm.    But she said she – you asked the question whether she was aware that the Board had asked if Dr Ngubane to attend the CCMA and she said yes.  But you must tell me if I misunderstood you?    But that is not what you intended saying.    But let us clear this first.  Did you say you were aware that he had been tasked by the Board or did you say you were not aware of that but you were aware that he did go to the CCMA?     Yes.  But whether he was asked by the board or not?     Or did you know?     Okay.     I did not hear the first one?     Okay.     H’m?     Ja.     So it was a delegation of four?     Okay.  And were they meant to engage in the negotiations with all the executives who had been suspended?     Oh, okay alright.       I am sorry.  Before you get there.  In paragraph 54 of your affidavit, you say the board emphasised that this would not alter the fact that he would remain on suspension.  I think they are talking about Mr Matona there.   And then you say it was Dr Ben Ngubane and Mr Romeo Khumalo who were mandated to meet with Mr Matona on 29 April 2015 to discuss the matter of his suspension.   So here it looks like you are saying only two board members were mandated to discuss with Mr Matona.     The group of four?     They then divided the job amongst themselves?     To say who of them would meet with who in terms of the executives?     Oh, okay alright.  And then you say in the     Is that true?     What is the basis for you to come to that conclusion?     Are you talking about tone at the meetings that the representatives of this group of four had with those individual executives?     Yes.  But I thought that this... I understood the statement to relate to one board and to relate to something that would have happened before the delegation could meet with the executives.   It gives the impression that even before the delegation met with the executives individually.  You are saying that it was clear that the board was not really considering the option of the executives coming back.  That is how I understand it.  Is that ...[intervenes]      Yes?     Yes. MS     Is that a meeting of the board?     Ja?     Is that the meeting where the board mandated the four to be the ones to negotiate with the executives?     Okay but there was a meeting of the board on the 23rd of April?     2015?     And you say it was clear to you, it was clear on that day that the board was no really considering the option of the return of these executives?     Ja, and what is the basis for you to have come to that conclusion?  Because you cannot, obviously, rely for that on what happened subsequently when the delegation met with the executives.   What is it that had happened or that was happening at the time of that meeting of the 23 rd of April 2015 that made you believe that the board was not going to entertain the return of these executives?     Yes.     Yes?     Is it notes that you have made at the meeting?     Oh, contemporaneous notes.  Okay are those notes, you have not previously given to the Commission?     Sorry?     It may well be Mr Seleka that it is something she can deal with next time.     Ja, okay alright.     So when they have had a chance to have a look at those notes.     Then, when you come back, one of the questions you can deal with is, what was the basis for you to say that it was clear that the board did not contemplate that the executives will come back.  Okay.       Alright.     I am sorry Mr Seleka.  Did you say Ms Daniels there are no recordings for the meeting of the 23rd of April?     It is what you were made to understand?     Oh.  And minutes, that would be there?     Yes.     Yes.  Okay alright.     Yes, ja okay.     No, that is fine.  Continue Mr Seleka.     I just wanted to understand.     Ja.     Ja, okay.     Ja.     Ja, that is fine.  Ja.     Oh, at that time Mr Koko was no longer your immediate superior?     Oh, he was... because he was acting ...[intervenes]    ...group CEO, he was therefore, temporarily, not your immediate superior?     Oh, okay.       Yes.     Okay.       Ja.  Okay.  Mr Seleka.     When he spoke... when he gave evidence, he talked about the day when the CCMA hearing or meeting was postponed.  He said that the Eskom delegation said they wanted to consult with the shareholder or the minister.   And then he said there was subsequently a meeting... there was subsequently a meeting which he referred to as the first meeting and then another one later on.   Now what you have just told me, does it relate to the day when the CCMA matter was postponed or does it relate to the one of the two meetings he talked about or some other meeting?     Yes.     Would that have been what he called the first meeting?     Or from your perspective, was it the first meeting for the Eskom delegation to negotiate with him?     Or are you not sure?     Okay alright.     Ja.  But was it the first one that you attended?     Okay alright.  So you said, what was the first point made or...?     Who said that?     Okay.  Mr Seleka.     Outlined what?     Ja, okay.     H’m?     I am sorry.  Let us just get this right.  Who was... who were at this meeting?  You were there, Mr Romeo Khumalo is there, Mr Matona was there.  Who else was there?     Ja.  H’m.     Yes?     Yes?     Yes, okay and yourself?     What was your role?  Was it to advise the delegation on legal matters or what?     Oh.     Yes.     Okay so you ...[intervenes]      You were at these meetings that we are talking about for negotiations with the executives at the request, at the instance of Dr Ngubane?     And your task was to take notes?     The logistics.     Ja, okay.     Okay alright okay.  Continue.  The Romeo about the framework?     Ja?     Whose question?     Ms Klein’s question to Ms Molefe.     Yes.     Did you offer them?     Mr Matona gave evidence and said that at the first meeting he had with the Eskom delegation after the CCMA...  After he had referred the matter to the CCMA and had been postponed, he said the delegation or one of the people on the Eskom delegation. And I do not know if he said it was Mr Khumalo, but he said he was told that... well, one, he said he wanted to return to his job but he was told in no uncertain terms that that was off the table.   Do you... that is what he has said.  And I think Ms Klein has denied that if I am not mistaken.     Or maybe she has not.  Do you... did he say that in any meeting that you attended, Mr Matona?  That.. was that said?  The part that was said by him, did he say it?   And the part that he says was said by somebody from the Eskom delegation.  Did he say that he wanted to get back to his job?     He did say that?     Ja.  Was there a response?     So you were present at the meeting where Mr Matona said he wanted to get back to his job?     Ja.     Yes, but you... do you remember or do you     You do not remember that?     Yes.     Yes?     Well, his evidence was that of the two meetings that he held with the Eskom delegation, it was in the first of the two meetings where he raised this issue of him going back to work.  Then he said he was told in very clear terms that that was off the table, out of the question.  You say you do not remember hearing anybody saying that to him?     Yes.     Ja.     Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka?     Well, before you get to that one, let us talk about where Ms Molefe was – the meeting with – in the Eskom delegation and Ms Molefe, did she talk about going back to work at all at her meeting with the Eskom delegation?     Sorry?     The impression you got was that she did want to go back?     But was that based on what she said or was just your impression?     Yes.  Do you know what the attitude of the Eskom delegation was to the possibility of her going back to work?     Yes.     Yes, did the solution necessarily exclude her going back to work?     Why do you say that?     Yes, okay and that came from the Eskom delegation?     Not from her.     Yes and what was her response to this?     Okay, alright.  Then you can move to Mr Koko’s meeting with the delegation.  Mr Seleka?     I just wanted to make sure that before she says Mr Koko’s meeting with the delegation was different with a clear picture as to how the other two meetings were like.     Okay.     It was a what meeting?     Ja, okay. MS     Yes.     Did you say you think he was shocked?     Oh, that he used.     You believe he was shocked?     Okay.  Yes, continue?     He or she was literally what?     Who is that now?     Oh, Mr Molefe.     Yes, okay.     Oh.     On the day that he arrived.     Yes.       One second, Mr Seleka.  Sorry, Mr Seleka, we are at half past four.  I need us to take a break but let us talk about how much more time you envisage you might need with Ms Daniels?     30 minutes?     Okay.  No, that s fine.  Ms Daniels, that is still fine with you, we can continue?     Okay, counsel for all concerned, it that fine?  Okay, thank you.  Let us take a short break, it is half past four now, let us resume at quarter to five and then we will go on and then we finish.     Okay, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us continue.     And probably what you should tell me is what it is that you implemented in order to give effect to – in order to bring about the secondment.     Yes, I am quite happy that she deals with that after she has submitted her affidavit, if you are happy, I was just trying to simplify your question.  So I think it is up to you whether you want her to deal with it briefly or you want to defer it to after – to the next time she comes back.        Yes.     Ja, okay.     Simplify it for her.     So but you say the report that was destroyed you have got – you have been able to find a version of it in your computer.     Oh, so you have not been able to access it?        Okay, but if it is accessed you would know if – once you read it you would know if it is the same?     Yes, okay, alright.  Now do you know whether that report had been submitted to the Board by Dentons as Dentons Report or final report or whether it had been submitted as one of the drafts before the final report?     Yes.     Oh, is your understanding that this was a presentation that Dentons was putting, was going to put before the Board in order to forewarn them of what to expect in the final report?     Yes.  But do you know whether Dentons ever got a chance to present that document to the Board in a meeting or whether Dentons simply submitted that document to the Board for the Board members to read so that they are forewarned of what the final report was to look like?     Yes.     Yes.     Having read both, I take it you have read the final report of Dentons.     Is it your observation that there is a vast difference between the final report and the document that you say was destroyed which you think sought to forewarn the Board of what was to come in the final report?     Yes.     And you say that the differences between the final report and that document that you  say was destroyed relates to the alleged role that was played – was set to have been played by  Mr Koko in procurement matters?     That is where the big difference lies.     Yes.     Ja, okay, okay.  Mr Seleka?     I am sorry, before that, this document you are talking about that was ultimately destroyed it would have – would it have been emailed to the different members of the Board or would hard copies have been made and they were distributed physically at a meeting of the Board and after the meeting they were collected to be destroyed?     Yes.     Ja.     Okay, alright.  Yes Mr Seleka?       I see that those minutes are not signed, but we have seen minutes last week and maybe this week that were signed like more than a year later and so forth.  Do you know whether there is any particular reasons why these ones are not signed?     Okay.     Oh, so there should be a signed one?     Okay so the legal team we must check that.     Thank you.  Where is Annexure SMD6 to which you refer in paragraph 74 of your affidavit?     Yes, please.     Page 38?     Oh, somehow I saw the colours at page 38 and somehow I associated those colours with the colours on the cover of the transcript of the parliamentary committee.     Okay.  So I just want...       Sorry?     Yes, ja.     Well, maybe I can ask her this question.  You see at paragraph 8, page 45 under interactions with     Now that suggests to me that you are saying that Mr Matona had not approached the company and indicated that he was amenable to a settlement being made in terms of which he would resign from his position and accept an exit package.  Do you accept that?     Yes.     Sorry.     He took Eskom to court?     Yes, but were you not recording here what the position was as at the meeting that you talk about in your affidavit, I think on the 19t h... is it the 19t h of May?   Ja, in your paragraph 73.  Paragraph 73 of your affidavit which is at page 17, paragraph 73 of your affidavit.  You talk about what happened at a meeting of the delegation of the board of 19 May.   And then after you have said what they... what was said     So the status of the discussions with regard to the suspended executives, what you recorded at paragraph 8, is it what was the position, I mean, as at the 19t h of May when the delegation of Eskom had a meeting?  Is it what was the position at the time you prepared the document which was 4 June 2015?  Or what was it?     H’m?     No, I am talking about this document.     SMD6.  I am asking whether you sought to record in that document the status of the matter of the executives as to where the process was or as at the 19t h of May or as at the 5t h or 4t h of June or on some other date?     As of...?     The 19t h of May?     Yes, okay.     Ja.     Okay.  So you certainly.... that would... that precede the meetings, the meeting between the Eskom delegation and Mr Matona to try and discuss a resolution of the suspension?     Is the meeting of the delegation of the 19t h of May precede the meeting of the delegation of Eskom with Mr Matona to try and settle?     The final meeting?     Had the first meeting taken place?     It had taken place.      So if your minutes... if this document at paragraph 8 is correct, then it would seem that what you say there, as far as Mr Matona is concerned, is not in line with what Ms Klein said and I think Dr Ngubane as well but I might be mistaken about Dr Ngubane.   Namely, that all the, except for Mr Koko, all the executives wanted to leave Eskom.  And they denied, Mr Klein denied any suggestion from Mr Matona that he said he wanted to go back to work.  So this, it would seem that what you say in paragraph 8 would in support of Mr Matona’s version.     Yes.  But with regard to the other executives, if what you say is to be read as suggesting that they made the approach to Eskom that they wanted to go, if that is what paragraph 8 also means in regard to the other executives, then that would be in line with what Ms Klein, I think, said.   But if you do not mean that but you mean that Eskom approached them and said let us talk about exit packages.      Ja.     Ja, okay.     Ja.     Ja.     Okay.     Ja.  Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.  So what is your final reaction to Ms Klein’s evidence and Dr Ngubane’s evidence before me that the board wanted all these executives to come back, they wanted them to come back?  It is the executives who choice that they did not want to come back.  What is your reaction to that evidence?     Okay alright.  Then the last one goes back to that one of R 800 million.  What was your understanding of what Mr Essa wanted you to do in return for him giving you that R 800 million rand if you accepted it?     Now... so I thought that you had said the R 800 million was offered so as to get Mr Koko back ...[intervenes]      ...to the company.     Because he was on suspension at the time.     Is that right?     Oh, it was not the suspension that we are talking ...[intervenes]      Oh, and this was ...[intervenes]      ...when?     Oh, this was a separate...     Oh.     Yes.  Okay.     Yes.  What would have been your... what would be your normal role when an executive such as Mr Koko was to face disciplinary process at that time?  What powers did you have?     H’m?     H’m.  Mr Seleka, has this... is this one of the parts that may need to have 3(3)-notices send out before she comes back next time?     Yes.     Okay.     Ja, okay alright.     So you will tell me more about it when you come back?     When all the details have been put on affidavit.     And those who may be implicating have been served by way of 3(3)-notices.     Okay.  I do not know whether counsel for Ms Daniels had any plans to re-examine?     Oh, you have some questions?     Ja.     What is that?     A letter to say what?     For Mr Koko?     If he wanted to go?     Oh, okay.     Well, is it correct in regard to the other two executives?     Did I take it ...[intervenes] [laughing]  I am sorry, I just could not resist. [laughing]  Is it correct in regard to them?     That does not mean it is correct.  That there were settlement negotiations with him, does not mean this statement is correct, necessarily.     So the question is about who may be approach?     So this statement, except for Mr Matona, is not correct in regard to any of the other executives?     Yes.     But that is something you realised only now?     Yes.     Yes.     Counsel for Ms Daniels, did you plan to do any re-examination now or you might do it some... when she returns?     Yes.  So ...[intervenes]      Ja.  So you could do it next time she comes again?     Okay alright.  Thank you.  Alright, we are going to... I am going to release you but you will come back to deal with the other matters that have not been covered.  But thank you for coming.  Thank you for everybody for cooperation.   For the rest of the week, the Commission is not going to have any sittings.  This is just for the... to inform the public.  It will resume on Monday, next week.  And next week it will hear evidence relating what is called the R 1 billion Housing Project of the Free State Government, that will be for next week.   We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Good DCJ.    Yes we are ready DCJ.    Yes.  Thank you.  DCJ today is the day scheduled for Ms Suzanne Daniels’ testimony; she is present and ready to be sworn in.    Thank you.    Thank you DCJ.  DCJ before I proceed, I wish to place on record for the purposes of clarity because there has been great interest shown in the testimony of Ms Daniels.    I wish to explain DCJ that the – this – this round of testimony of Ms Daniels will relate mainly to the suspension of the executives.    The issues pertaining to transactions relating to Tegeta, Trillian and McKinsey have not been forgotten.  They will not be touched in this time of her testimony but they are deferred to the second round of the Eskom hearings which will come in due course.    Yes.    Thank Mr Chair.    Ms Daniels just for home keeping aspects you will have before two lever arch files.  Let me place them on record.  The set of lever arch files that will be used Chairperson is Eskom Bundle 08[a] Exhibit U18.      Thank you Chair.  You may Sir.    I do not think there is any more Chair.    yes.    That is right.    Yes.    If I may proceed that is – ja I was placing on record Eskom Bundle 08[a] Exhibit U18 and Eskom Bundle 08[b].    That is correct Chair.    Ms Daniels do you confirm you have the two files?    You do.  Thank you.  Just quickly Ms Daniels if you go to the index in the – in Bundle 08[a] which is the bigger of the two files there is an index and in the interest of time I wish to – I would like you to confirm that you have already made a statement or submitted a statement to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee way back in 2017 when it was doing its investigation.  Correct that statement is Item 1.3 in the index.  Submission by Suzanne Daniels to the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises.    That statement is on – contained on page 58.  Page 58 in this bundle to page …    The red – the red Chairperson.     The red – the pagination Ms Daniels is the red one at the right hand corner – top right hand corner.  So that is the numbers I will only be referring you to.  To page 83.    You see that.  And then you also testified before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  They have produced a transcript which you find on page 84 of this bundle to page 127.  It is dated 8 November 2017.    You have provided two affidavits to this commission. You have the main affidavit and a supplementary affidavit for purposes of what I have taken you through.  I want to refer you to your supplementary affidavit which is contained on pages 50 of the same bundle to 57.    The 57 you see that?    You confirm your signature?    And the date of the supplementary affidavit being 1 September 2020?    If you please go to page 52 – 52 paragraph 7.2.  There you state in your affidavit  “I stand by the testimony in Parliament save for the correction of the date on meeting with Mr Salim Essa In Melrose Arch for the first time on 10 March 2015.” The testimony you are referring to is the one contained in your – in the transcript that we refer to.    So that – is that the only change you wish to make in regard to your testimony in Parliament?    Other than that you stand by what you said in Parliament?    Thank you Ms Daniels.  So Ms Daniels you have agreed to assist the commission insofar as the Eskom Board took decisions to suspend the top executives.  Correct?    Just before we go into that you can go back to the main affidavit which you will find on page 1 of your bundle.  I simply want to place on record your career progression within Eskom.    Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes.  Ms Daniels.  Sorry Chair.  Ms Daniels let us do likewise in respect of this affidavit as we did in respect of the supplementary.  On page 21 the affidavit runs from page 1 to 21.  Page 21 that is the last page with the signatures on it.  Do you confirm the signature of the deponent that it is your signature?    And the date you signed is 17 August ?    So this is indeed your affidavit?    Yes.  Then you – thank you Chair.    Let us see.      18.    18.1 Chair.    Yes.    Thank you Chairperson.    Indeed Chairperson.    Should – while we are at it – ja I think as we go along. I thought we could admit the supplementary now.    Ja.    It is U18.2.    It is Item 1.2 at page 50.    50 yes.    The…    1 September 2020.    U18.2.    Chair then it is her written submission to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.      On page 58.    To 83 to be admitted as Exhibit U18.3.    Then we have also referred to her transcript at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.  That starts on page 84.    84 and we ask that it be admitted as Exhibit U18.4    Thank you Chair.    The others will be admitted as we go along.    Yes.    Mr Daniels page 1 of your affidavit deals with your personal details.  Paragraph 3 with your qualifications which included Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Laws and Post Graduate in – Port Graduate Diploma in Law you see that at that the end of that page?    Yes Chair.    Ja.    Correct.    Indeed.    Indeed Chair.    Yes that is – that I was going to touch on.    But now that the Chairperson has reminded me Ms Daniels and for the sake of the viewers as well since – because of taking you through your submissions at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, referred to your transcript the purpose for that was to have that placed on record before us so that we do not have to traverse your evidence as it is already given.  So we will in this – in this hearing be focussing on the issues that we need clarity on for the purposes of this commission so we may not touch on everything but for context you are at liberty if you want to tell the Chairperson so that he understands the context to elaborate on certain things.    Thanks.  You understand that ja.  Thank you Chairperson.  The – the information will in any event be made available on the Commission’s website so whoever needs to have access to it Chairperson will find it there.  So quickly Ms Daniels looking at your job projection within Eskom you say you were employed at Eskom for the first time 1 May 2006.  You joined Eskom as Chief Legal Advisor in Generation Primary Energy.  You will just indicate.    That is correct.  April 2007 you were appointed into the position acting Contracts Manager Primary Energy Fuel Procurement.    April 2008 you became a senior manager of Contracts in Coal Water and Gas?    Is that a division Coal Water and Gas?    You remained in that position until January 2010?    You then became a Managing Director in Primary Energy Division.    Senior Manager.  I see.  Just correct it again.  You say you were the senior manager?    Is that is February 2010?    Who did – say it sorry.    Ja.  Who did you account to?    And then 11 April 2015 you became a senior manager in the office of the Chairperson of the Board?    Was that a formal appointment?    Yes.    Do you want the paragraph dealing with this?    So who is Leo?    Yes.  When Mr – Dr Ben Ngubane asked you to become a senior manager in his office what was your position?    And who was that?    And according to your affidavit you become the Company Secretary from 1 October 2015?    So then you hold a dual position?  Senior Manager in the office of the chairperson and the position of Company Secretary?    So you held the position of Company Secretary from 1 October 2015 to 27 July 2017.    When – when was your dismissal?    20 July.    2018.  You were also the acting Head of Legal and according to the affidavit that was from the 1 September 2016?    And for how long did you hold that position – acting position?    Yes.  If – well your – if your dismissal came a year later what happened – what was your position in the intervening period from 27 July 2017 to 20 July 18?    Okay so from then on you – you became the Head of Legal?    You were no longer acting you were now permanent Head of Legal.    Thank you Chairman.    Thank you Chair.  So you saying he told you in April 2016?     It was 28 September 2015, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Sorry, Chair.     Yes, Chair thank you.  Ms Daniels, the emails are in the second file, Eskom Bundle 08(b), page 944.     944.     944, Chair.       Page 944.       Are you there?     At the bottom of the page, it is an email     Now the document, Ms Daniels, and I will ask questions on this, on the emails.  The document that Dr Ngubane said would have been attached to this emails is on page 948.  It is contained on pages 948 and 949 dated, 28 September 2015.     So do the emails jolt your memory in regarding to this exchange of... the exchange preceding the emails relative to this document?     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, we may want to read on record the contents of the two documents.     Because I think that is important.     Ms Daniels, if you go back to page 948, back to the, what I believe is a draft.  Is that correct?  Page 948.     I believe it is a draft.  And this person is writing to not only Eskom but the other SOE’s to adopt this as a draft of the board.     Now the document reads    We do not have those two ...[intervenes]      No.     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels, you were saying to... explaining to the Chairperson that what ultimately transpired is that the resolution was adopted by not... but not by way of Round Robin but in an actual meeting?     Yes.     Is that a good idea?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you.     Thank you.  Ms Daniels, let us go back to page 948.  I have read the paragraph immediately under introduction.  So I will move onto the second paragraph.  It     “City Press, Mail Guardian and Sunday Times in the recent past.” “They have published stories in their respective papers, making unsubstantiated allegations of fraudulent conducts in our administration and corruption against officials of the sister’s state-owned companies.” The sister’s state-owned companies.  They... what is that, Ms Daniels?     Yes, please.     Tell the Chairperson.     Yes.     Okay.  Shall I carry on, Chair?     Yes. “They have selected to not report on the verifiable responses provided by the relevant SOC’s.  SOC’s irresponsible... and irresponsible published gossip and sensationalism without any regard for fact. The above form of reporting by the three newspapers is misled...” Now I want to check if that mistake is also there.  Is misled to the members.     Is it exactly there?     Yes.   “The above form of reporting by the three newspapers is misled to members of public.” That is on page 945. That is the resolution subsequently adopted.       Thank you, Chair.   “The above form of reporting by the three newspapers is misled to members of the public and is intended to influence public deception.”     Ja, Chair I do not... what the Businessman wrote, I would not want to correct.     I will read it as it is.     Yes. “...and is intended to influence public deception that state-owned companies are corrupt and guilty of stealing public funds.   If this negative trend by the three newspapers is not challenged, it will cause irreparable damage to the roles of the state-owned companies in assisting government in job creation and economic growth. It is therefore important that the state own companies...” Now you will see it is missing the “ed” there.   “...the state own companies should collectively suspend any dealings with the above three newspapers until such time they provide verifiable proof supporting their allegations referred to above.”     Seleka.     Yes.  Mr Seleke is coming...     The reasons I am asking that question is because when you go back to that page which is on the board’s resolution the portion of the resolution does not     Yes, he did, Chair.     Ja, he did accept that.      He recalled that the document was sent to various SCOs.     And that was the one to Eskom.     Yes.     Ms Daniels, the meeting you say took place in respect of this document on page 945, can you recall the date of that meeting?     Ja.     Sunday Times.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  Do you think you would have the minutes of that meeting, not now but you could check for that?      And …[intervenes]     Ms Daniels did you know who is that person?     So in September 2015 you did not know who was that person.     Is there a reason why you took it at face value?     Well, we have seen …[intervenes]    Opportune time, Chair, indeed.     It is actually June 2016, Chair.     That is actually June 2016.     The earliest.     From what we have been able to obtain.     Thank you Chair.     Chair are you done with your questions?     Yes, Ms Daniels I had asked the question whether you knew who Businessman was at the time of exchange of these emails?     You say your attorneys, during your disciplinary action did some research and according to their research they told you that it was Mr Richard Seleke behind the name Businessman?     You will obviously recall that the Chairperson finds otherwise in his ruling, he finds that the email – info portal, most probably belonged to Mr Essa.     Okay, let me know from you, did you know who is the person behind the name Businessman, using the email address, info portal 1?     You say you were told by Dr Ngubane that the email address or Businessman email address info portal belongs to Mr Richard Seleke.     That would have been long before your disciplinary action at Eskom.     Now these emails, if you followed the hearing of – the testimony of Dr Ngubane here, before the Commission, were exchanged with Dr Ngubane, September 18 before Mr Richard Seleke was appointed at DPE.  His date of appointment was effective 27 November 2015, did you know that?     Now, Dr Ngubane himself has said, to the Commission that, in fact, he understood from you that the email is of Richard Seleke and not – he understood from you and not the other way around, you told him, not him telling you that, that is the email of Mr Richard Seleke.  Would you explain your comment to the Chairperson on that?     Thank you Chair, you see and what we – this Commission has been able to obtain through the Fundudzi report is that on 21 s t June 2015, Mr Richard Seleke, using an email address, blueberries.slk@gmail.com, he sent his CV – this is prior to him being appointed at the DPE, he sends his CV through info portal 1 on Sunday 21 June 2015, and he says, “Evening sir, please find attached my CV and supporting documents, regards Richard”, That you find on page 1042 of Eskom Bundle 08B, 42 at the bottom of the page, Ms Daniels, you see the email, blueberries.slk@gmail.com, it’s from that email address to email address infoportal1@soho.com, the subject is Richard CV, the email is sent at 22h32, that’s twenty eight minutes before eleven at night, you see that?     And the email immediately above that, it’s a forwarding email.  The forwarding email from Businessman, in inverted commas the email is infoportal1@soho.com, date is 21 June 2015 at 8h34pm, subject forward, Richard CV and it’s sent through anckimcwc@gmail.com and that email address, if you look at the email above, seems to belong to Ms Kimberley Davids and Businessman writes, “Hi madam, as per sir, this is the candidate for DG,  it possible for him to meet madam on Tuesday, regards”. So, Businessman forwards Mr Richard Seleke’s CV to, on the face of it, appears to be Kimberly Davids and he says this is a candidate for DG.     Than you Chairperson.  Ms Daniels the position of DG, is that the position that Mr Seleke, ultimately was appointed into?     Director General at DPE, I see there, then the email on the top of the page is from Ms Kimberly Davids, that email address which info portal used, anckimwc@gmail and she seems to be forwarding to herself, now at an official address, kim.davids@dpe.gov.za on the 23 r d of June 2015 and the subject is, forward, Richard CV, there’s an attachment referred to as Mogokare CV.doc, qualifications PDF, do you see that?     Now on the face of this exchange, it would appear that Businessman and Richard Seleke are two different persons, any comment on that, do you see that?     How do you know that Richard Seleke used it?     No, I’m asking you, how do you know that Richard Seleke used it?     Okay would you have that email?     And tell me, just repeat that again, what did it say?    An email from info portal?      When was that?     Well let’s look at this further because Fundudzi has another correspondence between Kimberly Davids and Businessman page 1032.  These are Exhibits, as you can see, from the report itself, 1032, you there Ms Daniels?     Now, the bottom email again which is 16 July 2015, it’s from Kimberly Davids with that email address of gmail.com, 16 July 2015, the subject is forward, Travons CV to Businessman inforportal1@soho and here she explicitly writes, “Dear Salim, herewith CV for Aleska Board as discussed”, And she’s not writing to Richard, you see that?     So, all the more the – all the more the – all the more giving credence to the conclusion that Businessman and Mr Richard Seleke are two different persons but this email takes it further, the email takes it further it, in fact, covers the face behind Businessman, do you have any comment, Ms Daniels?     And, that leaves one – if you look at this correspondence before Mr Seleke is appointed DG in the office of the Department of DPE, two things.  One is, it puts a big question mark on the explanation that he would have been the one having interest in the affairs of Eskom because at this stage he would have been the one having interest in the face of Eskom as a DG of the DPE because at this stage he’s not in that position, he’s not in that department, that’s a big question mark on that explanation because look Dr Ngubane says it was an explanation you gave to him and he didn’t have a problem with it because it’s an interest expressed by the DG of a department that oversees the SOE’s.  Now, I can let you comment on that first and then I can go to the next point.     So – well, so Dr Ngubane says you told him, he’s the DG, Mr Richard Seleke he has an interest they want to see the media statements before they are published because they see them for the first time once published and he wants to know beforehand and that was your explanation, what do you say about that, just that portion, did you say that to him?     Minister Brown?     No, I’m talking the DG now.    Sorry, who raised the concern, is it the Minister or is it the DG?      Not the DG?     Did you tell Dr Ngubane that the DG raised the concern?     No, did you tell Dr Ngubane, you personally, saying to him, the person behind the email, Businessman is Mr Richard Seleke and this is the reason why he’s corresponding with us.    So, you maintain that it is Dr Ngubane who told you that the man behind Businessman email is Mr Richard Seleke?      Thank you Chair.  The other point then, my second point, was, phased with this information on the face of which it is apparent that Richard Seleke could not – could most probably not have been the person behind the email Businessman info portal, how, in your view, should the Commission deal with that aspect because we can only go by the documents before us?    Shall I carry on?  Thank you.     Chair, then I was provided with the document which I showed Ms Daniels during the adjournment, I’m going to beg leave to hand it up, Chairperson.  It goes with the documents we’ve referred to on page 945 and 948; the draft resolution that was prepared and sent to various SOE’s and then in respect of Eskom we saw that, that draft became the draft resolution for the Board to adopt.  What we’re focusing on here, this – with the production of this, Chairperson, is the persons who created the document itself, the draft itself.  Ms Daniels might not know but I’ve shown her the documents it’s an IT production and I beg leave to hand it up.  So what is being handed up to you, Chairperson, is a copy of the email, the first page is two emails which we have already referred to, firstly exchange between Businessman and Dr Ngubane on 28 September 2015, Dr Ngubane then forwards that email to Ms Daniels on the same date, we’ve referred to that, we can turn the page and we will mark the document in due course for the purposes of the record.  Then you have the draft document or draft resolution which was adopted – adopted into Eskom’s document, Ms Daniels you follow?     That’s two pages and then the third page is what has been drawn to our attention, Ms Daniels.  Now you have this document, info, at the top, urgent request email attachments and you have these blocks, read only document, compatibility mode and then you have protect document.  Against that block of protect document you have related dates; last modified 28 September 2015    The Chairperson of Denel?    At the time September 2015?    At some point he was the Chairperson?    And then last modified by you chose the name of the person there Salim Essa and if you read this together with that email from Kim Davis where she says –    Do you have any comment?    Yes.  Chairperson then you turn the page you go to what Ms Daniels has said is a template of a resolution for Transnet.  Is that right Ms Daniels?    And you go to – turn again that page – you go to the last page of this document it has similar information – the same information as to the author and the person last modified.  The author again Mantsha Attorneys and last modified – oh here last modified – I beg your pardon by the same Attorneys.  For the purposes of the record Chair I would ask that the document be admitted as Exhibit U18. – it is going to have to be Point 5.1.    It was 18.4 the last number Chair.    But I am going to explain why I added Point 1 at the end.    It is going to be at page – we will add it to the bundle at page 951.1.  What I have not done Chairperson is to admit the emails we have referred to.    And mark them as exhibits and those emails which are starting at page 874 would be admitted as Exhibit U18.5.  That is the e – the Businessman’s email to Dr Ngubane and then Dr Ngubane forwarding that email to Ms Daniels.    Is it 874.    Yes Chair.  Let me – not 874 sorry.  Sorry Chair those emails which I want to have admitted are on page 944.  Page 944.  Together with the – that will be from 944.    And the related – and the related documents until page …    Yes.    Yes.    During lunch will be in order Chair.    So that it does not delay.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you Chair.  That will be done during the lunch break Chair.    Thank you.  Ms Daniels there is more emails exchanged with Businessman but they come in during 16.  But I think this is the critical moment what we have gone through now – that is the critical moment.  So I – I would like – Chair unless you have any questions I want to move on?    Yes.  Talking of Mr Salim Essa Ms Daniels have you – you have met with – well ja rather say that you have met with Mr Salim Essa as we understand from your affidavits; your testimony, correct?    And can you tell the Chairperson your first occasion when you met – the first occasion when you met with Mr Essa?    Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels in your affidavit when Mr Matshela Koko phones you you say it was in the afternoon in paragraph 18 I think of your affidavit.  I am – I cannot recall whether the Chairperson asked you whether did he – did he give you reasons why he was calling you to Melrose Arch?    Yes.  So he gave reasons but he was not specific or he did not give reasons at all?    Did you ask him for the reasons?    Ja.  Was this the first time and as I understand it this is during working hours?    You were at work and you receive a call from him. Is it the first time that he called you during working hours to come to him somewhere outside of the office?    In March 20 – well not March 2015 – when you – you were reporting to him at this time.  Is this the first time he is calling you?  Was this the first time?    So he had never called you prior to this to come to him at Sandton?    Ja no any time before.     He did not call you to cancel him at Woodmead Shopping Centre prior to this?  Because it is really around the corner of Eskom?     But you are trying to think, I see in your face.     So this would have been... it would have made it all then more strange that he was calling you during office hours that he had not done it before but he was doing it now for the first time during your normal office hours and you would go to them to him to a place he does not even identify where in Melrose Arch.  It will make it all the more strange.     But you went, nonetheless.     Thank you, Chair.  Ja, the Chairperson has already asked you.  You know, how did you know where to wait for him?     Well, JB Rivers... Dr Ngubane says he was there.  Mr Koko himself says he was there.  Now you say you were also there.     That sounds like some meeting point.      Now, Mr Koko... you have seen his statement?  It is actually his affidavit.     And he says... he called you to... he agrees calling you to Melrose Arch.  He agrees meeting with you at JB Rivers but he says you did not go anywhere else.  The two of stayed at JB Rivers.   And he wanted you to advise him on his... on a labour related issue or his labour rights because he was being threatened by Mr Tsotsi to be suspended if he did not reverse the suspension of Mr Malesela Sekhasimbe.  You saw in his statement his affidavit?     And tell the Chairperson what is your response to that?     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels, what boggles one’s mind is this.  That this seems to be a secret meeting.  Is that how you understood it?     It is not a meeting... when I say, it is not a meeting arranged by emails.  We are going to meet at Eskom office on such a date, such a time.  It is a phone call     And that what gets to be discussed there are things pertaining to Eskom, letters pertaining to Eskom by a person who is not an Eskom employee or official.  Mr Koko did not say people are going to be suspended.  Correct?     Mr Koko did not say what is the procedure to follow in order to suspend.  You say it was Mr Salim Essa who was talking?     So what boggles the mind is.  How is that they would call you to such a meeting to discuss such sensitive issues.  Call you and not anybody else.  Did they trust you?     Thank you, Chair.  Well, you see, one has... and you need to explain this.  You know, the public has received some negative reports about yourself that had received some positive reports.   You had been called the whistle-blower.  And you need to balance these perceptions that if you go to a meeting like this, that really these people either trusted you or you must be part of them.       And maybe you need to explain to the Chairperson and I think that is why the Chairperson is at pains to find out, you know, how do you get yourself into that meeting so that we move on from that point.  You either are part of them, hence they are able to discuss these things with you or maybe there is some other reason why they did.     Thank you, Chair.       Thank you, Chair.  So Ms Daniels, and I know I have said when we started that there are matters that you will deal with in the second time around.   So what one sees here from this moment onwards, because this is the beginning of the suspensions, once those officials are out that were to be suspended, you have new people coming in.   You have Mr Brian Molefe, you have Mr Anoj Singh.  But let me focus on Mr Brian Molefe.  At the very beginning of his entrance, there is the Tegeta issue ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     I just wanted to deal with the impression that gets created.     That gets created.  And maybe you can explain.  I mean, we will deal with the details later.  That here you have this contact with Mr Salim Essa in this meeting. And there is a facilitation of the transactions with Tegeta later on which features in your disciplinary hearing that leads to the prepayment to Tegeta, for instance, of R 659 million.   And that you are one of the parties’ central in the facilitation of that prepayment.  You see that impression that gets created?     Ja, so these things need to be explained.  You do not just appear on the scene once but you see that the trend developing on where you feature.  You may want to say something now or you can say it later.       When we deal with it.     Thank you.  And okay, so the meeting is over and you go home and we know that ...[intervenes]      H’m.     And on your way home, I mean, that is apparent from your documents, your testimony, your affidavit that you called a friend of yours and... paragraph 27.  You     Yes.  And the next day, Mr Koko asked you about those telephone calls.  Now let me ask you about your friend because you did not give us more details regarding your friend.  Did your friend know Mr Salim Essa?     Did you know that your friend knew of     If I may, Chair?     Paragraph 31.     Paragraph 31.     Of the affidavit.     We should take it.  We can take it, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, DCJ.  Ms Daniels, did you have any interaction with the Gupta brothers?     Did you tell the Chairperson the circumstances under which you had such interaction?     No, Chair, I think we can go into it.     Is it out of sequence?  It does not matter.     Ja.     Yes, no Chair that is perfectly in order with me because that covers – it kills many birds with one stone if I may say so.  Ms Daniels the meetings you had particularly after the second meeting where Mr Madsella Gugu[?] asked you to go with him to Melrose Arch you say and you were simply made to sit outside the boardroom where they have a meeting.  Did you not – this is early 17 at the time you are the company secretary in 2017.         Ja, company secretary and acting head of legal.  Now that is fairly two senior positions and you are accountable to the board as a company secretary you attend board meetings.  You have been working at least until that point directly for – when I say working you have been working in the office of Dr Ben Ngubane.  Ja, your yes’s will have to be recorded.         Yes, do you tell the board about this thing?     What do you mean by that?     I was about to ask the same question.     No I am saying to her I was about to ask the same question, Chair.  Your microphone is off Chair.      Yes, because…[intervene]     No we do not…[intervene]     She has not told us the name.     No.      She’s – no.     My question.      Shall we rather go to the meeting.  So I had asked you the question after your second encounter with Mr Koko and Mr Essa where you were taken to Melrose Arch.  They leave you outside the boardroom, they go into a boardroom meeting.  Why did you not – well I said did you raise the issue with the board.  Your answer was no because at that time the board…[intervene]          So and you were going on to explain why.      Thank you Chair, let us accelerate the – to what I believe is the fourth meeting and this – my assessment is that this meeting it gives us the connection between Mr Salim Essa and the Gupta’s.       Yes, that is late July meeting where you have described you are behind Melrose Arch, the townhouses, the apartment and so on.     So that establishes a connection between the two?     So we know now that they working together?     And I did not follow your narration – you were called by Mr Salim Essa.  Is that what you said?     Where are you when he calls you?     Or at work?      You were not at work.  So would this have been over a weekend?      Over the weekend, so he calls you and you oblige?     You go to Melrose Arch.      African Pride?     Hotel.  Well the obvious question follows why did you go?      Thank you Chair.  Yes, and Ms Daniels you go there – well I said to you this morning that one will find it strange that this people kept on calling you to this meeting’s.  Either they believed that you were with them or either they knew that or that they really trusted you as one of their confidants.  How do you clear that?        You did not what?     You were offered.      Thank you Chairperson.  So this meeting to which you were called by Mr Essa himself directly which means he has your telephone number, he could access you.  Correct?       You did not block his number?      Not prior to that?     You say the discussion was about Mr Brian Molefe’s case.  Which case was that?     Did the pension pay out to him?     Okay.  Do you know whether what was said about they will try to get somebody in the office of the Deputy Judge President whether they acted upon that?     What you are not aware, you are not sure you – did you come to know about it?     Whether there was interference for lack of a better word.       Do you know whether there was interference?      Thank you.  Ja, I see in your affidavit you talk about in paragraph 30 of the affidavit about political interference.  I was quite use to the amount of political interference and lobbying behind the scenes.  Would you like to enlighten the Commission what is being referred to there as political interference?       Paragraph 30, page 7, at the top of page 7.      Sorry who would have told you that?    So would Mr Dan Marokane have told you that?    Because he was once your boss as well?    Ja but answer my question.  Would – would Mr Dan Marokane have said that to you?    Okay but you know like the Chairperson has been pointing out some of these things do not appear in your affidavit.    Ja because they will have to be notified about these things so that they can respond to it.  So I think Chair if I may propose to the witness?    You may have to do an affidavit elaborating on those –     Those political interferences.    On the parties.    Thank you Chair.    But Ms Daniels what we see from the documentation we went through this morning is that if you talking political interference there is more than just political interference.  If regard is to be had to the newspaper – the resolution regarding the newspaper houses City Press, Sunday Times and Mail and Guardian then came from outside to the Board sent to Mr Ben Ngubane; it becomes a resolution of the Board.  That is another interference is it not?    You would know I have not referred you to it but I – I did refer you to when Dr Ngubane testified.  It is an email Mr Koko receives about the guarantee which was firstly a pre-payment R1.68 billion regarding Tegeta to be paid to Tegeta.  And there is an email that from Mr Koko rather from Businessman to Mr Koko then Mr Koko forwards you that email.  Recall that email that talked about the guarantee?    You recall that.  That too came from Businessman into Eskom through Mr Koko through you ultimately made its way – was it the Board or the BTC?    Then the Board.    So there too it is an indication of an interference from outside?    So this Board was being controlled by outside forces if you like in inverted commas – outside persons – persons outside of Eskom?  Whether it be Mr Richard Seleke he is outside of Eskom; whether it is Salim Essa he is outside of Eskom and they were writing these emails putting proposals together and feeding them to the Board.  You follow?    It was a control from outside?    And in addition to that if – if your information – your testimony is go by the evidence you testified with the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee it is in your statement; it is in your affidavit that on the 10 March you were at Melrose Arch when you are being told four executives names are mentioned are going to be suspended.  Again an indication of outside interference?    Ja.  It is more than outside interference it is outside control is it not?    Why did you not resign from Eskom?    I see.    Yes.    For interested parties. MS    Hm.    Sorry interested parties what?  Interested parties within Eskom or outside of Eskom or both?    Okay let us go to the suspension of the executives because they are suspended on the 11 November and you as I understand from your affidavit were not part of the meetings that led to their suspensions?    So you had the – you had access to the audios of those meetings?    Ja well let us talk about the minutes which are being referred to here the 9 March 2011 and then the minutes – the meetings of 11 March 20 – oh I said 2011 I beg your pardon 2015.  Well the commission has obtained audios of those minutes – of those meetings so you would also have had access to them?    So you would have – you would have listened to that.    Yes.  Ja okay.  Now that you have raised that let me ask you.  Do you know why the minutes would not have been constructed a week after the meeting took place?    No let – just answer my question.  Do you know yes or no?    You do not know?    Why they would not have been constructed?    Within a week after the meeting took place?    Ja.  So you had to do that exercise a year later.    The minutes are signed by Dr Ngubane.    You would have – he would have had to ensure that those minutes what you bring to him as a draft minutes which he has to sign is a correct reflection of what took place in the meeting?    Ja tell the Chairperson.    Briefly.    Thank you.  You have spoken in – well stated in your affidavit that in the morning of 11 March 2015.    Thank you Chair.  In the morning of 11 March 2015 Mr Koko called you in rapid succession and one of the things he spoke with you about or rather raised with you was the concerns that you have called two people and he was asking you why did you speak to them?    One being your friend and the other one being – he said the Frenchman.    Yes.  But you know I have – we have obtained the telephone record between you and him in which we see that there is a telephone call from him to you the evening before – the night before in three minutes before ten.  And I was curious to know you did not mention anything about that and him at least that night questioning you about who you were speaking to on your way back home.  Do you think you have an explanation for that?    Yes.  And Ms Daniels there is an occasion or for lack of a better word immediately after the suspension of the executives where you talk about you meeting with Dr Pat Naidoo.  Can you tell the Chairperson a little bit about that what – who called – how you meet with Dr Naidoo.  Who is firstly who is Dr Pat Naidoo?    You deal with it in paragraph 42 to 46 of your affidavit. MS    So which day is this?  Sorry.    Thank you.  Carry on.    Was that your impression?    What did he – did he convey to you that they were already engaging – the Board was already engaging with Mr Linnell.    Do you recall or not whether Mr Linnell was every formerly appointed by the Board?    You were called upon to cancel Mr Linnell’s contract?    Do you recall when about was this?    What 2015?    Are you looking for a document?    SMD3 is on page 32.  Page 32/33.      So SMD3 is an annexure to your affidavit.  The document is a letter dated 14 April 2015 from the Project Office Business Improvement Delivery.  It is signed on the face of it what appears to be by Mr Nick Linnell resignation as director.    Is that the document you were referring to?    And the letter is addressed to acting Chairperson Dr Baldwin Sipho Ngubane Eskom SOE “Dear Chairperson. Appointment of Coordinator of the Eskom Inquiry.” Two options Ms Daniels I could read the letter or you could give the Chairperson the gist of what is contained in the letter?    Ja what is Mr Nick Linnell writing about in this letter?    So in the last two paragraphs of his letter he writes? “It is clear from written correspondence and public statements that the Board appointed me to fulfil this role.  It is now also apparent from the media reports that the Board has since allegedly terminated that appointment.  In the circumstances I would be grateful if you would advise me of the position of the Board with regard to my appointment and if my services have as publicly stated been summarily terminated how the Board would like me to account for my services rendered.  Yours sincerely.” What did you want to tell the Chairperson about this?  Oh you were – you were talking about you had to – you were called upon to terminate.    His – his contract or his appointment.    Subsequently yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair I think we have that invoice.    In the bundle somewhere.    Yes.  Ms Daniels the next issue or the next aspect where you feature is in regard to the exit negotiations.  You called an exit negotiations of the – of the executives.  And you say you attended some of the meetings the – the delegation that the Board had mandated to have settlement discussions with the executives had.    Did you find that in the relevant paragraphs in your affidavit?    Yes.  Now are you aware or not that Dr Ngubane had also been authorised by the Board to attend at the CCMA in regard to the labour dispute of Mr Matona?  If you do not know you do not know?    You are correct Chair.    Chair you are correct.  That is what he said before the Chairperson.    And we were pursuing that issue with him because…    And we will do so.    Correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chair.    It is absolutely accurate Chair and it is an issue – Chair you will find – can I give you the page reference?    In Dr Ngubane’s bundle.    Well no, no it is even in – yes it is even in this bundle Chairperson.    Let us do that.  Chair you can read it so that you clarify if – you clear your mind.    That is right.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Can I just read through his statement?    It says he says   No your recollection is correct.    That is correct.  That is correct Chair.    From his affidavit before us – so his admission.    He says that.    Correct Chair.    Your recollection is perfect Chairperson.    So Ms Susan – Ms Daniels I should not have read that statement to you but you already say you know that he was – what did you say Ms Daniels?    Where?     No, thank you.     I understand Dr Ngubane will tell us... he has already told us himself.  So but you are then involved... not involved but you are invited into settlement or exist, you called them, negotiations that the delegation... the delegation, as we understand it, is Dr Ngubane.  And you can confirm that.  Dr Ngubane, Mr Romeo Khumalo and Ms Venete Klein. And in respect of, I think, Mr Dan Marokane, Mr Zethembe Khoza and Mr Romeo Khumalo were the delegation.     As the delegation.     And Mr Khoza as the delegation.     The delegation, ja.     Were you in the meeting when the delegation was appointed?     Ja, okay.     They have testified as well.     That they were... well, only two.  So you know because you had to deal with them.     You attended the meetings when the negotiations took place.     So let us deal with Mr Matona, for instance, by way of example.  So when you say you had to arrange the meetings, you would have called him and said to     And you said they met at Protea Hotel in Midrand.     Ja.  What do you recall was the discussion with him?     Yes.     Okay Chair.     Ja.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.       So Ms Daniels, then let us rather go into the meetings where there are settlement discussions and you are present at some meetings, you say you have arranged.       Thank you, Chair.       Yes.     Yes.  Now, I was certainly going to go to that point Chair because the minutes what on the face of it appears to be the minutes has been attached by Ms Daniels.   There are certain things that Ms Daniels state in her affidavit that are not apparent from those minutes.   Hence, she has then only yesterday emailed, scanned and emailed copies of what she says are handwritten notes.  So we are here to deal with that.     Ja.  Thank you, Chair.  So but, I mean, similarly, there will be not minutes of this next meetings we are going into.     Ja.     Ms Daniels, I understood from your affidavit that even though you attended meetings of three of the executives, you did not attend the meeting where the delegations met with Mr Dan Marokane.     Yes.  Well, I wanted you to explain that to the DCJ because earlier you mentioned that you attended or maybe you gave the impression that you attended meetings of all four.     Ja.     Yes.  And I had asked a question    Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  And please carry on Ms Daniels.     Well, Ms Daniels your affidavits, you are starting with this at paragraph 57.     Can I just before you go there Ms Daniels?  Let us read your affidavit... these two paragraphs into the record.  That is paragraph 64 because they are significant.  Page 15 of your affidavit.     I will read it.     It says    And so the delegation does not go away.  They wait for the next person to come.     On the 4t h of May at the Protea Hotel.     So it goes on to say    So how were you able to recall all these details?     Where does the notes that you would have made available to Dr Ngubane?     Ja, because I understood that he was asking you to be present in those meetings in order to do exactly that, take notes so that you can provide him with...     So ...[intervenes]      Well, Ms Klein did say, she recall the words... what?... amicable.  Amicable or parting being mentioned or separation.  But, anyway, they will deal with what you are saying in due course.  So Ms Molefe, according to you, responds and essentially she required more time?     She was ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chair.  And then you attended Mr Matshela Koko’s meeting as well and you seek to convey that that meeting was different from the others in comparison?     Thank you, Chair, thank you.  Yes and you were …[intervenes]     Indeed.  Indeed, Chair.     Ms Daniels, then you may go into Mr Koko’s meeting.     This meeting, does it take place on the same day as well?     So you deal with it on paragraph 68 of your affidavit and could you briefly just explain to the Chairperson how this meeting compares to the others?  The other two you have mentioned.     Are you done?     It is paragraph 71.     Ms Klein in her affidavit to the Commission, Ms Klein says Mr Koko was the one executive who wanted his job back.     You may or may not know this but Ms Klein in particular has also stated in her affidavit that she understood that the – at least the two executives, that is Ms Tsholofelo Molefe and Mr Marokane wanted settlement agreements with the board, that is why the board appointed a delegation to go create settlement agreements with them.  If you do not know, you do not know.  If you know you may tell the Chairperson what you know.     You know, I am reminded because I am giving you Ms Klein’s version to the Commission, I am reminded of one version she also gave which is that you were – it appears that you were in fact involved in the drafting of the letters for the suspension of the executives, you together with Mr Salim Essa.     Yes. In fact the letters are termed pre-suspension letters.  But now in your explanation to the Chairperson, I want to go back to these exit negotiations, you called them.  If you say the board – what the board sought to achieve was to exit the executives, the three you have mentioned, did you know what the reason for that was because here they would get rid of or exit the CEO and the CFO all at the same time.      He was moved from where?     So generation, it is a division within Eskom?     Can you explain to the Chairperson what generation was responsible for? MS     Is that on page 17?  Page one seven, paragraph 73?     This is one the – which date is this?     Ja, but the date?     Well already in April the Minister had announced the secondment of Mr Molefe.     17 April.  17 April 2015.     Thirty minutes, Chair.  I personally need 30 minutes.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you DCJ, Chairperson.  Ms Daniels you are still under oath, thank you.  Just before the adjournment then we talked about what in your view would have been the reason why the executives were exited by the Board, and the subsequent secondment then of Mr Molefe.  Correct?   Your microphone is off.     Were you aware beyond what you have mentioned how the secondment of Mr Brian Molefe came about, and now when I am asking you that question and you don’t know the answer please do not speculate, unless we ask you to surmise from what was happening. Were you aware of how he was seconded?     Oh yes, you had to administer?     Of what?     Yes.     Yes, you can certainly do so, Chairperson as she answers your question Ms Daniels has indicated to us – we would actually prefer her to have an affidavit specifically submitted to us dealing with the secondment.     Ja, Ms Daniels you are going to go into the details which I wouldn’t know offhand, I would prefer that we defer it.     Okay thank you.  Then in regard to – were you aware that executives were suspended on the ground or preferred reason that there was going to be an investigation.     Yes, and we understand that Dentons was subsequently appointed to conduct an investigation.     Did you have to deal with Dentons?     You were interviewed?     And who was the – what do you call them, the Group Executive for that division?     Let me put this to you, Ms Klein talks about this Dentons report, but there were three versions and the first version was destroyed, according to her because it disclosed the names of persons and entities who had not been consulted. She goes on to talk about the second version which – from which the names were redacted and then talks about another version which was redacted by yourself and subsequently made public without the Board approval.  Could you respond to that, well firstly are you aware of those allegations she is making?     If I may simplify it thank you Chair.   Let’s start with what is the version of the report said to have been destroyed.     Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Daniels you may want to refer the Chairperson to the minutes, the minute of the meeting you are referring to I think is     Thank you Chair, and I think the Chairperson’s question might be answered by what is reflected on the minutes.  I see the minutes are on page 47, minutes of Eskom Holding Board Meeting extract from the final minutes of Eskom Board In-Committee meeting on 14 August 2015 at the Eskom Research Testing and Development Boardroom, do you see that at 900?     I see also on page 48 paragraph 123 members considered mediates dictation, do you see that?     Could you read that also quickly?     Then follow that resolution you started with in paragraph 6.2.1 and 6.2.2.     Yes Chair.  Ms Daniels then the issue regarding you are said to making public a further redacted version of the report without Board approval, which is what Ms Veneta Klein alleges happened. MS     And you are saying to the Chairperson that the Board was aware of that?     Two last points and – sorry – may we go back to the testimony you have already given.  The last meeting that you had at Melrose Arch where you place is it the Minister or Deputy Minister, Ben Martens?     Yes in that picture I mean this work stream hasn’t investigated that I should draw to your attention and I am sure you know by now that Mr Ben Martens has denied being present in that meeting.     Okay Chair I don’t know whether she needs to comment on that but it is a matter we haven’t investigated.   Number two Ms Daniels it is the paragraph in your affidavit on page 17, paragraph 73 where you’re talking the Board delegation meeting on 19 May 2015 and that you were in attendance and I think you need to address that to the Chairperson because the members of the Board delegation those who were appointed to be the Board delegation will have to be confronted with what you say there.     Okay.  Would you please tell the Chairperson where did this meeting take place?     Could this meeting having taken place in Eskom, at Protea Hotel, at Melrose Arch or wherever?     And who was in attendance apart from yourself?     And...?     Thank you, Chair.  That concludes my questions to Ms Daniels.     If I may assist?     Page 38.     Yes.     Parliamentary portfolio.     Chair, may I ask while Chairperson is going through this document?     May I ask some questions while the Chairperson is going through?     Ms Daniels, this document is dated 4 June 2015 and in your affidavit you refer to it as... what do you refer to it as?  It is a briefing to the minister?      Yes, a brief to the minister from chairman on the status of the suspended executives.  Now, the status of the suspended executives, I wonder what did they mean by that.  What do you they mean by that?   I see paragraph 1 of the document on page 40, it is introduction.  Paragraph 2 is board resolutions of 11 March 15.  So, those are the resolutions we have learnt about all of last week.   Paragraph 3 deals with the terms and conditions of suspension.  Now that too we learnt about but you want to convey to the minister the status.  Is it on the 4t h of June or maybe around that time?   Paragraph 4 deals with effect finding forensic inquiry.  So it does not specifically relate to the executives.  So 3     Paragraph 5 deals with courts challenged by Mr Matona.     Certainly, Chairperson.     Yes.     Because we do not have it in her affidavit.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Chair, before he does that, let me just ...[intervenes]      Ja, just one last point to Ms Daniels.     Going back to that paragraph in that report Mr Chairperson referred you to under paragraph 8     Sorry, they what?     What do you mean?     Oh, I thought he... no, this paragraph says apart from Mr Matona, aside from Mr Matona, the others wanted to go.  But that cannot be correct if one looks at the evidence of both yourself and Ms Klein that he wanted to come back.     Yes, that he wanted to.     So what is being conveyed to the minister here is not correctly reflecting ...[intervenes]      ...the position?     Well ...[intervenes]      And but ...[intervenes]      Chair?     That is it. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.    Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?    Do you swear that the evidence you will give will the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth; is so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.     All rise.  
MS DANIELS:  Suzanne Margaret Daniels.      No.    Yes.    So help me God.    Yes I do.    That is correct Mr Chair.    That is correct Chairman.    That is correct Mr Chairman.    Yes I do.    Yes I confirm my signature Mr Chairman.    That is correct Mr Chairman.    Yes that is correct Mr Chairman.  The commission’s investigators actually when we consulted pointed out to me by virtue of phone records that we got the date wrong in Parliament.    Yes that is correct.    That is correct Mr Chairman.    That is correct Mr Chairman    Yes Mr Chairman I confirm that that is my signature.    Yes that is correct Mr Chairman.    Yes indeed it is.    Yes that is correct Mr Chairman.    Yes Understand.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Mr Chair.    That is correct [00   It was still in the Primary Energy division Mr Chairman.    Yes that is correct.  Eskom underwent a re-structuring at that time and I moved across to Group Commercial.    That is incorrect Mr Chair.  It is not a Managing Director.  I was the senior manager in the office of the Group Executive.    In the office of the Group Executive for Group Technology and Commercial.    Yes but…    It could have been from 2010 onwards.    Oh my apologies.  It – Primary Energy I then moved to Group Commercial.  My first boss was Dan Marokane.  We moved together from Primary Energy to Group Commercial.    That is correct Mr Chair.    At the time it was not a formal appointment Mr Chairman I – I do go into it a bit later but I – you wish me to answer it now?    I just want to find the –     It is paragraph 47 of my affidavit.    The main affidavit and it is on page 11.    Okay.  So on the 9 April the acting Chairman of the Board Mr – Dr Ben Ngubane called myself and Leo Dlamini who was the manager in the office of the Chairman to his office and actually just told us that I would be taking over so that is how it happened.  So on the 11 April I then worked with Leo to transfer information – transfer duties.    Leo Dlamini was the senior General Manager in the office of the Chairman at the time.  Mr Tsotsi in his evidence did refer to him as the manager there.    I was the senior manager in the office of the Group Executive, Group Commercial.    That – at the time it was Matshela Koko but he was acting and he had been suspended.    Yes that is correct.    I actually did not.  The responsibilities for the Chairman’s office in terms of correspondence was dealt with by the office of Chief Executive.  I then just deal with the other matters pertaining to the office of the Chairman.  Sorry Mr Chairman.  I handled the liaison with the Ministry – the Department of Public Enterprises more particularly the Minister ’s office and then attended to the Board duties of the Chairman – the administrative issues that he needed to deal with.    Yes that is correct.    20 July 2018 Mr Chair.    Yes.    Yes that is correct Mr Chair.    I think it was until the 27 July 2017 Mr Chair.    Mr Chairman here I am going to have to give you some context.  I was the – I was then the Head of Legal and Compliance.  I – the 27 July 2017 was quite significant because it was the first Board meeting of I think the Xhosa Board meeting – the Xhosa Board in Eskom.  And it is at this meeting that I was told – well prior to that – weeks prior while I was on leave it was announced that a Board breakaway that I needed to choose between being Company Secretary and Head of Legal.  I was overseas at the time.  So when I came back this was the first Board meeting that was held and the issue was raised again by the Board and I was then told to choose.  And I chose to become the Head of Legal and Compliance.  And that is why the 27 July is – it is an odd date but it was – and what was more dramatic that it was actually with immediate effect.  Even though it – it had an impact on the governance you know arrangements in Eskom it was immediate effect that I was relieved of my Company Secretarial duties.    Yes that is correct.    That is correct.  I was permanent. ADV SELEKA    Yes I do recall that but I do need to correct it Mr Chairman.  The chronology is incorrect.  It was actually – it was April 2016 not 2015.    Ja because the emails in question at the disciplinary hearing are in 2016.    Mr Chair I am not certain of when he told me but I do know that he told me that it was the DG’s email.    The first email that I have in my records was when I replied to all.  Subsequent emails have come out here in the commission that I have watched and it seems that it started in 2015 – late 2015.    Yes that Dr Ngubane forwarded it to me.    Not that I have in my records.    Mr Chairman.    It does appear that there were some that were forwarded to me.    I think Mr Chairman you know the – I cannot say that they were not in my Inbox you know what I mean.    I say I cannot say that they were not in my Inbox.    But I did not take – I took them at face value at that time.     Yes.     First from the evidence that has come out and that what I have been made aware of, it was late 2015.     Yes.     I have not seen them Mr Chairman.     So I would not be able to, you know, categorically say.     They were usually part of a conversation regarding some subject matter that we were dealing with.  The one was about a media statement.  I think both were about media statements.     [No audible reply]      Here I am.     Yes, I am.     Board of Directors.     Yes, I do Mr Chair.     Yes, it does Mr Chair.     I think it was... this would have been roundabout the first time that I have seen it in direct correspondence like this.  I really cannot pinpoint.  2015 was such a ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]      Ja.     2015.  That is correct.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, he would have phoned me and said, I have sent you an email.     I ...[intervenes]      I would have prepared the document that you see on page 945.     I would have prepared the document that you see on 945.     Yes.     946.     Yes, that is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     No, that is correct Mr Chair.  That is indeed what happened.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     Mr Chair, I cannot remember if this was attached to the email.     But when I prepared the document, there were the letters from... there was a letter from the chairman of Transnet.     Which indicated... it was addressed to the Minister of Public Enterprises, Ms Lynne Brown.     And it indicated that Transnet was going to withdraw its media stand and its media participation with all of the publications mentioned.     Yes, that is correct.     It was a letter.     The board.  I think it was Ms Linda Mabaso.     To the Minister of Public Enterprises.     And ...[intervenes]      On the... and I say a resolution of the Transnet Board.  So there would have been... there ought to have been ...[intervenes]      ...a formal resolution, a formal document.     ...that I would have attached to this one.     I will definitely check my records, Mr Chairman.     But I am not sure if I still have them.     But ...[intervenes]      I would go on these documents, Mr Chair.  And I would say yes it did.     What I do recall that this was not actually a Round Robin ...[intervenes]      This did not become a Round Robin decision.  This actually became a meeting.       This one ...[intervenes]      The... which letter?  I just ...[intervenes]      That one I am not clear about.     That I am not clear about.     I am not sure who drafted it.     No, I was not.     It would have been the end of September because it was addressed... it was sent to from Dr Ngubane.     No, from here, it was forwarded to me.     Yes.     Well, he asked me to prepare the document which you see on 945.     Yes.     Those...     Yes.     Not that I recall, Mr Chairman.     Not in so many words.  He just asked me to use that as the basis.     This document.     Yes.     That is what I did.     Yes, it is just that we... this... I subsequently found out, if you look at page 950 is the way that Transnet did its resolutions.     And ours was slightly different.  So that is why it is in 945, it is done in that particular format.       The substance is the same.     Yes.     This was addressed to the board to make the resolution ...[intervenes]      ...that you see at the bottom of page 945 ...[intervenes]      ...which says    That is correct, Mr Chair.     That is correct, Mr Chair.  There was actually a special meeting called to deal with the media... and I am trying to think of the correct word.  I think it was described as a media onslaught at the time.  And that these specific publications, who were identified by the board, as not favourable to Eskom.     Mr Chair... do I go into detail now?     Okay.       Mr Chairman, there was actually a conversation between the minister and the chairperson about the media treatment of... when she... when they talk about sister companies, they are talking about Eskom, Transnet, Denel.  I think those were the main ones at the time that we were being bombarded in the newspaper and ...[intervenes]      Yes, it is supposed to be ...[intervenes]      Yes, it was actually the state-owned companies that were within the portfolio of the Department of Public Enterprises.  And that is what it was meant to say, sister state-owned company.     It is.     Yes, Chair.     Mr Chair, I do not actually have a recollection of, you know, the copying and the pasting and things.  I recognise the Transnet documents.     I recall the letters from the minister... my apology.  I recall the letters from Ms Mabaso.  I recall the conversations that the chairman had with the Minister of Public Enterprises.  Ja.     I am not sure if I would have corrected this letter.       Well, this was... I am not sure what version this is.     So this would have been a copy and paste.     Okay so I ...[intervenes]      Yes.     This is the ...[intervenes]      That I...     Yes, so I am not... there may have been corrections to the grammar and those things but the base document would have come from document 948.     I am not sure, Mr Seleke(sic).  I remember this document ...[intervenes]      Oh.     My... [laughing]     My apology, Advocate Seleka.  I do... I remember these documents, the Transnet documents.     That is fair comment, Mr Chairman.     I really cannot recall, I would have to look at what was attached to …[intervenes]     Mr Chairman, I am a stickler for grammar.     I said I am a stickler for grammar so I would have corrected these mistakes, so that is why I am not sure if there were other versions.     That is correct.     Ja, he asked me …[intervenes]     He asked me to use these documents to prepare …[intervenes]     The document for the board, yes.     And that is what I did.     No, I would have read it.     I would have read it.     That I cannot recall but …[intervenes]     But if I had prepared the document then it is possible that I would.     You know, I would not say that I did not, I could not say that categorically right now.     Yes, there was a Transnet resolution.     I do not recall if it was attached to this particular email.     It may have been a subsequent email.     Yes, that is correct.     This would not be something that he would have drafted.     No.     He did not prepare his speeches from scratch, Mr Chairman.     Yes.  There was a process within Eskom.     Certainly during the time that I was in his office.     What would occur would be that the executive responsible for that particular area would draft the content …[intervenes]     Yes.     And it would be sent to the media department.     We had a dedicated communications department.  They would sort of make it media friendly.     It would then come to me, I would look at it and check if it made sense.     Just from a – from someone who knew nothing about it, that as the test.  And those questions or issues would then – I would raise them with the communications department and with the executive responsible and say look, this is too technical or, you know, really do you expect the Chairman to talk about this?  These are the kinds of questions that would come from that.  If it was something that, you know, was not immediately able to be clarified, I would request them to brief Dr Ngubane in any event.  He also read through his speeches and made his own …[intervenes]     Changes and amendments.  Once the speech was finalised, you know, he would get a copy of this is the proposed speech, the media - communications department would then prepare possible questions with answers.  So there would be active participations from his side because he would be the one presenting it.     No, this would not have been prepared by him.     From my understanding, Mr Chair, and my recollection, this was the Transnet template, this was the Transnet template.     Or they may have used the Transnet template.      I really cannot recall, it would have been around this time, Mr Chairman.     Yes, Mr Chair, that was my understanding.     And that was what actually happened.      I will definitely check.     Yes.     I accept that, that is exactly what happened.     Mr Chairman, from the evidence and from my experience within Eskom this is someone external to Eskom at the time.     Yes.      I did not know who that person was at the time.     No, Mr Chair, I did not.     Mr Chairman, at the time I did not interrogate it as I would later …[intervenes]     I did not interrogate it as I would later.     At that point in time I took it at face value.      I – at that time I was still the senior manager and I honestly had no reason to believe that there was anything sinister in the activities of the Chairman and in his conduct.  You know, I - you know, when you start a job you always believe that people are good and I did not have any reason at that stage to even suspect anything.     No, I did not Mr Chairman. ADV SELEKA     In my disciplinary hearing, Mr Chairman, my attorneys did an extensive search and with the help of the organisation called OUTA it established that it was a DG Seleke.     Director General’s Richard Seleke.  Based on my further reading that I have done and assessment of the evidence that has come out in the Gupta leaks etcetera, it’s my suspicion that it wasn’t just one person, it was indeed an info portal but I do suspect that one of the administrators of that email box was Salim Essa.     They didn’t just tell me, Mr Chairman, we received IP addresses and I think it was technical data from ALTA.      Mr Chairman, it was most probably, they also did not produce any evidence that it was, indeed, Mr Essa’s.  What Eskom relied on in my disciplinary hearing was the emails from the discredited Matshela Koko so there was no direct evidence that it was and he found that it may have possibly have been Salim Essa.     No, I did not.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes.     Mr Chairman, it’s clear from the emails that Dr Ngubane introduced the info portal email into the system…[intervenes].     Assuming, but in my experience, what was introduced to me…[intervenes].     Yes.     Not that I could find on my system.     Yes, I see that.     Mr Chairman, she was the Executive Assistant.     She was the Executive Assistant to Minister Brown.     No, I did not.     Yes, I did because I had to liaise with her on issues relating to meetings etcetera.     Yes, that is correct Chairman, he was the Director General.     That’s correct, I do see that.     I see that on the face, Mr Chairman, and that is why I say that, you know, it is my suspicion that this was used as an information portal, this particular inbox and that it was not managed by just one person.     That I accept but later on, Richard Seleke, himself uses that very inbox, you see, so that is one of those reason why I said to you that I don’t think that it was one person that used this info portal address.  We just don’t have enough proof.     There were emails in the Gupta leaks and ALTA…[intervenes].     There was an email in the outer bundle that they gave us which was from info portal, signed, best regards Richard.     Yes, it was part of our evidence bundle at the disciplinary.     I can’t remember the details now, Mr Chairman, but it did say, best regards Richard.       Yes.     I would have to ask my attorneys.     Yes, I am.     Yes, I see that.     Mr Chairman, I still have, based on what my experience was, I cannot discount that Salim Essa was one of the people that had access to this box but it is still my suspicion that there was more than one person handling this box.     Well, all I can say is that it was – from Dr Ngubane that this was the DG and I took it at face value.     I didn’t say that to him but that did happen when it was – it was, in fact, when it was a major media statement the DPE did want sight because Minister Brown was not impressed, to use a colloquial terms but when she saw the media statements for the first time in the media and that she hadn’t been briefed or had input, so on major issues she had wanted to see them beforehand.     Minister Brown, yes.     Well, he would have been the one handling the issues on her behalf.     In my recollection, the Minister raised these…[intervenes].     Not the DG.     In the email that we got?     No, I did not.     Yes, he did.     I did not deal directly with the Director General, Mr Chairman.     I said, I did not deal directly with the Director General, you know, to tell the Chairman that, it would have been the other way around.     I’m quite clear that I wouldn’t have told him that it was DG Seleke.     Well to my knowledge yes, I don’t think he did.     As I said, Mr Chairman,  if you look at the totality and you look at the correspondence in the Gupta leaks, for example, and you look at, you know, the specific institutional emails, it is, in my view a suspicion that Salim Essa was one of those people that controlled that inbox.  I, you know, I found other emails, I did not have direct contact with Salim Essa and you can see from this, I would still say that it’s highly suspicious that at various points in time he was the one directing those emails but there isn’t, in my mind yet, because I don’t have access to everything, that conclusivity.      Yes.    Mantsha Attorneys I can assume is Daniel Mantsha he was the Chairperson of Denel at the time Mr Chairman.    Yes.    I will have to check but if he was ..    He was Chairperson – he was related to Denel.    I see that.    I still think that it is – it is more than likely that it was more than one person but I do not discount that he would have had something to do with infoportal.    Yes that is correct.    Yes that is correct Mr Chairman.    Mr Chairman I met Mr Essa for the first time in March 2015.  As I testified in Parliament it was on the 9 March but as I said to you earlier with the – with the commission’s team and using phone records they have confirmed for me that it was actually the 10 March.  I was called to – by Matshela Koko who was the acting Group Executive for Technology and Commercial at the time and I was called to Melrose Arch to meet with him.  It was around about lunchtime.    Matshela Koko.    He held the position of acting Group Executive Technology and Commercial at the time.    And – so Dave Facto [?] he was my boss.  I went to Melrose Arch and I waited for him at the restaurant called JB Rivers because he told me I must wait for him.    He just told me to come to Melrose Arch.    For me that was sort of a hub and I thought that would be the easier – easiest place to… thought that would be the easier – easiest place to…    Yes and then I told him where I was.    He told me to wait there and I waited for about an hour.    No not at that stage.  He wanted to talk to me about certain matters.    Certain matters.    Yes.    That is what he said when he called.    But he did not – he was not specific.  So I waited at the restaurant and he came across and he collected me.  We then went across the road to an office building and we proceeded to go to the – I think it was the first floor and we walked towards an office in the corner and at the entrance I could not see there was not any plaque identifying what the company name was etcetera.  We went inside.  I had to hand in my phone at reception.  We waited in a board room and a couple of minutes later.    No.  We – the conversation was quite limited you know.    It was like where are we going?  He said be patient.    It will become clear.    It was in the afternoon.    Around about lunch – lunch time.    Ja.  Or just after lunch    Because people were having lunch at the restaurant and things like that.  So – I cannot remember specifically the time but it was in the afternoon.    We are then ushered into this board room and we waited – we wait a couple of minutes and I still asked him you know what is this about?  And he was like be patient.  And then this gentleman walks in introduces himself to me as Salim Essa and that he is the advisor to Minister Brown.     Yes.    I was quite surprised because I had not heard of him before.  I looked at Mr Koko and he just sat there quite – quite comfortable.  Mr Essa then proceeds to ask me what do we need to do if we want to suspend people.  And I was a bit perplexed you know.  And I said to him well firstly I am not a labour lawyer.  And so – my area of expertise does not extend that far but what I can tell you is that you need a very good reason to suspend people.  You cannot just suspend them willy nilly. It is at that stage that he then proceeds to tell me – or sketches out that in the coming days the four executives namely Tshediso Matona, Dan Marokane, Tsholofelo Molefe and Matshela Koko would be suspended.  At this point I look at Matshela Koko because he is sitting in the room and he is actually unfazed by this revelation.  Mr Essa continues to tell me that there would be an inquiry and he knows that these executives more than likely….    At Eskom.    Okay he was talking about Eskom.    And the – into the – he just said into the affairs of Eskom and that you know certain people would – would not – not return.      And he said that certain people would not return.    Yes.    Mr Chairman at that stage I was quite shocked.    I was – even though I was a senior manager I had not been exposed to this kind of behind the scenes machinations.     Because he was talking of suspensions.  I – my understanding was that they would not return to work.    Yes.    He was unfazed.  He – I still looked – because he was sitting opposite me.  I – you know directly opposite me and I looked at him and I frowned in sort of bewilderment because I was like how – what is going on here?  And he just gestured you know be quiet.  He raised his hand he did not speak much.    No, no he did not say keep quiet he just – he raised his hand as if to say you know do not ask too many questions.  So it was gesture.    Yes.    Like just leave.    Do not ask too many questions?    Yes.    No he was not.    He was quite comfortable.  He was relaxed in his chair.    I think he was you know he had some – a cold drink I cannot remember what but it …    But it – it was not – it was like an ordinary conversation.    I was quite bewildered.    We left shortly after.    How did you respond to this revelation from Mr Essa?    Well I said to him that there would – this is not possible there would have to be reasons for suspending people.  You cannot just suspend them on – without any reason.    I remember I repeated that.  For me what was shocking was that he had said that in the coming days …    That this would happen in the coming days.    And that was a bit you know that was shocking for me.    And I think when – when he realised that I actually did not you know could not add any more value to the process questions that he was asking the conversation ended.    Matshela Koko proceeded to walk me out.    Of the building.    And I remember asking him how – how is this possible?  You know.  And he just said well this is what is going to happen.    And I then left and went home.    He did remain behind.    No I did not include it in the – in the statement.    I am just you know this is more formal.  I spent a lot of time trying to remember, going through my notes.    Ja.      Well at the time I did not understand it like that Mr Chairman.      Because he was –     My apologies.    You see he spoke about an inquiry.    So I was not very clear at that stage.    I said I was not very clear at that stage.    What he was – who he was referring to.  That would become clearer later.    That is correct.  But it happened so quickly that I did not make that connection at that point.    I – I am a bit confused now Chairman.    I think – I think it would be – it would have been the four of them.    I think if I – I said I am a bit confused now.  So I think it would have been the four of them    Yes.    It was not a deliberate omission.    It was not a deliberate omission Mr Chairman.  I think going through preparing for my testimony since four weeks now.    I am not sure.  I do not think it was.    I do not remember.    Mr Chairman for the – for preparation for the commission I had to go through my notes and I brought my actually original notes.    Which I did not go through at the time of giving evidence.    In 2017.    No they are not of the meetings that I speak about later in – in the testimony.    They jogged my memory as to what – what was said.    There are references to it from the Board’s side Mr Chairman.    No he did not – he was not specific.    No he just said come meet me at Melrose Arch.    I said – I asked why and he said we will let you know.    I asked why and he said I will let you know.    Yes that is what he – we spoke – we spoke quite a lot of times so I may have the sequence wrong but you know he was not specific as to I want to discuss X with you.  It is just meet me there and I will – I will speak to you.    It will be more I will speak to you when I – I will – I will discuss the matters when I see you.    Yes.    At that point in time yes.    Yes.    No not at this time.    Not that I can recall Mr Chairman.     Ja.  Not that I recall.     [laughing]  Yes.  No, the trip to Melrose Arch stood out for me.  That is why I do not think, not that I recall that we met at other places.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes, I did indeed.     I just parked in the central parking, Mr Chairman.  And I walked up and out of the escalator, I think the first restaurant to the... that I could find, was JB Rivers(?) because, you know, it was locked(?).  I sat down and I let him know that I was there.       H’m.     Mr Chairman, I for the first time... I listened to the testimony last week and that is when I heard that they were at JB Rivers as well.  So, you know, for me it was strange but that was the closest restaurant.     Yes, I have been there before?     Not many times.     A few, yes.     When I used to shop at Melrose Arch, I would go there.  So.     [No audible reply]      Yes, I saw that in his affidavit.     With respect Mr Chairman, Mr Malesela Koko is lying.       That did not come into the conversation.     We... he collected me at JB Rivers and took me to the office.     No, he did mention his tussle with Mr Tsotsi but it was not about the pending or being threatened with suspension.  What I do recall is, subsequent later in the year, this... the suspension and the disciplinary matter against Mr Sekhasimbe did continue.     But at that point in time, he did not mention Mr Sekhasimbe’s suspension to me.     He also did not speak to me about Mr Tsotsi’s threats and he definitely did not ask me advise on a pending suspension.     I did ask him, Mr Chairman.     He did not really answer me.  You know, he just shrugged his shoulders.       You see, at that point I was an Eskom functionally in the office in Mr Malesela Koko’s office.  So when he had issues, process related issues or, you know, questions, I would be the one responsible to get the answers for him or, you know, get the right people to speak to him.   He did not characterise me in the affidavit that Advocate Seleka refers to as his legal advisor at the time but I was not in that position as legal advisor.   I was in his office and I generally was an executive assistant.  So I think from that perspective, you know, I would have been the go-to-person.   But I did not have the necessary labour process other than what I knew this is the process that was followed at Eskom.     I was not told why I was brought there, Mr Chairman.       It was difficult to conclude why I was brought there but what I did do was then call... I called Dan Marokane and asked him to come and see me.     To come and see me.     So that I can... could tell him ...[intervenes]      ...what had transpired.     No, just what I told you today.     Key things.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     That is correct.     Yes, that is correct.     I... Mr Chairman, that has been an issue that, you know, has always been in my mind, as I have been sort of privy to some of these discussions and my testimony will later tell you.  It just appears that, they did not really think that people would speak out, you know.     Would speak out about what had happened.  I did not know Mr Essa.  So the confidence with which he spoke ...[intervenes]      At the time, it was one of respect and trust.  We had gone through a challenge with Eskom in terms of procurements, litigations.  And we worked quite closely together.   So at that time, you know, I had no reason not to trust him.  He was fastidious.  He was meticulous.  He followed Eskom processes.  You know, it was a... at that point, it was a good relationship.     [No audible reply]      Mr Chairperson, I cannot give you a reason for why they would trust me.  I sometimes felt like a use, you know, just a useful functionary, just part of the background.  But in my own... just from what Advocate Seleka is saying is that, you know, there has been this theory that I was part of it.   And I would urge you to just look at the Gupta’s modus operandi.  I was not offered bags of cash.  I was not entertained at the Saxonwold residence.  I was not in Dubai at the lodges of the Gupta’s.  I certainly was not a member of the Roy Club.   I did not get invited to any of the functions or any of the things that people have testified about.  So it is something that I also do not understand, you know, why there would have been this blatant ...[intervenes]      I think at the time he did.  He did.  But he had also earlier told me that, you know, I must tell Dan that we are not of the correct political affiliations.     I said, I think at the time he did trust me because he also told me to tell Mr Marokane that we were not of the correct political affiliations.     Myself and Mr Marokane.     No, I think at that stage they did... Mr Koko probably thought I would not disclose the information.     [No audible reply]      Yes.  Sorry, Mr Chairman.  Yes.     I see that.     I prefer to say later when we deal with it.     Yes.     No, Mr Chairman I went back to work.     Because I... I was actually... I live in Pretoria.  And I was actually quite shaken by the meeting.     So I drove straight home.       Dr Gieunu(?).     No, Mr Chairman.  What he did say is he knew of Mr Salim Essa.     Yes.     Well, as I have testified in parliament, Mr Chairman.  He... the friend that I spoke to was quite... he worked in government circles as well.     In government circles as well.     Yes.     He was a one time advisor to Minister Mcebisi Jonas.     Jonas, Mcebisi.     Jonas.     So and we had been friends over 20 odd years.     So I thought if there is one person that some understanding of what the political landscape looked like it would be him and that he would give me an honest answer.       It is in my parliamentary statement so I can tell you.     His name is Rustum Mohammed.     No, Rustum Mohammed.     Rustum.  R-u-s-t-u-m     Before I arrived home, yes.     No, no.  I did not go back to work.     I went straight from Melrose Arch, home.     It would have been late afternoon.     Roundabout three in the afternoon.     The traffic... roundabout three in the afternoon.     Ja.  The traffic was not yet ...[intervenes]      ...was not yet heavy.     It was around lunch time when we were at the... when I was at the restaurant.     Yes.     Yes, I did.     Yes, I did.     Yes.  I just said    Well, I was talking about the suspensions.     Because the distinct impression was that, you know, this was going to happen.     No.     Well, Mr Chairman, that is the impression that I got.     That was the impression that I got, even if he did not say that in so many words.     That he would be able to, you know, arrange these suspensions.     Arrange the suspensions.     Yes.     Yes.     To get them suspended.     Ja, he said in all probability, yes.     No, he did not, I did not tell him.     No.     No, I did not, he found out in parliament.     I do not think we had that specific conversation.     I do not recall that we had that conversation, Mr Chair.     Yes, it may be strange to you now.  At the time I actually did not speak much about Eskom matters to my friends, anyway.  And Mr Mohamed lives in Cape Town, not here in Gauteng so it would not be something that we would discuss on the telephone.     My purpose was to find out if this man could – you know, had that kind of power that he purported to have.     That is all I wanted to know at that stage.     Well, the ensuing days actually showed more than that.     Ja, he did not – no, I did not tell him that.     Well, I did not tell him anything.     Yes, I did.  One of them, Mr Chairman.     I had the occasion to meet with Ajay Gupta.  It took place late July 2017.  I was called by Salim Essa and the conversation was actually about Mr Molefe’s pension matter that was before court at the time.  I said to him do not waste my time, you know, Brian is going to lose the matter.     That is why I am saying Mr Salim Essa called me.     Salim Essa called me.     And the said – the introduction was about the Molefe matter, Brian Molefe’s pension matter that was before court.  I said to him Brian is going to lose that matter and he then said let us meet for coffee.     He was asking what was happening with Brian Molefe’s matter.    Mr Salim Essa.     Late July 2017.     In the interim I had had communication with Mr Essa.     There was one meeting, physical meeting at his offices when it was at Trillian.     I cannot recall the precise date of that meeting, Mr Chairman.     That would have been either – early 2017, mid…     Yes.     We were talking – would you want me to describe that one as well?     Okay.  So that meeting, Mr Matshela Koko told me that we were going to a meeting with Ms Lyn Brown to talk about IPPs.     Yes.     He said I must please come along, we are going to meet Minister Brown to discuss the IPPs.     Yes, the …[intervenes]     Early 2017.     And I went along.     I assumed that we were going to Pretorius about once again we ended up in Melrose Arch.     No, he did not.     No, he did not.   Because it was a me with Minister Brown I assumed we would be going to …[intervenes]     To Pretoria.     We ended up in Melrose Arch.     This time the offices – what I later came to find out, it was the offices – it was actually the offices of Trillian.       You know, the Trillian Group of Companies.     I was made to sit outside the boardroom while he and Salim Essa had a meeting.     Because it was a glass office I could see them but I was sitting outside of the boardroom.  During the time that I was sitting out there, Mr Eric Wood from Trillian came past and introduced himself to me.     And during that introduction Mr Essa and Mr Koko then came out of the boardroom and Mr Essa joked with me then, you know, you must tell your boss to stop Tweeting.     Talking about Mr Koko.     Because he was very active on Twitter.     And I think he has earned the nickname of tweeting engineer.  So he was very active there.  That was the end of that meeting.  Mr Koko and I had then left.  I obviously was very irritated with Mr Koko and I said to him why did you bring me with to this meeting?  You know, I had to sit outside.  And he said well, he had things to discuss with Mr Essa and I just said please do not put me in this position again, do not waste my time.  We then returned to Eskom.        Not at all that day.     I did ask him in the drive back and he says that would be arranged for another time.     Yes.     Yes, it was very strange and I was actually quite furious that he had wasted my time and had once again taken me into that situation.     No, he did not.     Mr Chairman, my only impression of what was happening at the time that it was really a power play.     He was Acting CEO at the time and he quite enjoyed showing that he was, you know, in charge.     Well, I think also just letting me know who – you know, who was in charge of my time and – ja, it was just – it was a bizarre moment.     But that is what happened, Mr Chair, it happened like that.  I sat outside …[intervenes]     But that is how it happened, so I am not – and I did have very, very stern words with him.     Well, he just laughed.     He just laughed.     I did ask me, that is what I said, in the trip back I said why did you bring me here, this was an absolute waste of my time.     Yes, he did.  And you must just remember the first time that he took me, I was in a much junior position than what I was in 2017.     So …[intervenes]     There was another one before that.     But it was not a meeting it was in June of 17.     It is out of sequence though.     Oh, okay.     Yes, okay.     Mr Chairman, with this one I would have to give you just a little bit of context, if you do not mind.     It was in June and Mr Matshela Koko had been on suspension for the conflict of interest where he had not declared that his daughter was involved in Impulse or …[intervenes]     2017.     Okay, so what I am – all the events that I am telling you now are in 2017.  And I – we had received the report from Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr and Nkonki about the conflict of interest.  On the fact of it, they could not find, you know, any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Mr Koko but what they had not done was interrogate the evidence.  It was merely taking of statements and things.   So when I presented the findings to the board, I said to them that they cannot take the report on face value, it needed to be interrogated.  There was a bit of to and fro.  This meeting was telephonic and it was a meeting to the audit and risk committee and it was – and I remember that I had to – I was at great pains to explain to them because there was a tussle between the – some of the board members said well, the report says he can come back, other members were we are not so sure.  But there was sort of a big leaning towards he can come back now because he was Acting CEO at the time. And I said to them you cannot do that, you know, you have to – we have to interrogate this report, you would be failing in your duty if you accepted it as is. Eventually, it was quite a struggle, it was a debate – you know, the minutes will show that there was quite a debate.  At the end of it I got the instruction to instruct a senior counsel to interrogate the report.  So that was the meeting that happened on the 14 July – my apologies, the 14 June 2017.     That was an audit and risk committee meeting.     That is the board …[intervenes]     Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr.     Okay, that was just the context for you as to what would happen next.  So the next day, this was in the evening, the next – I then got the instruction to brief counsel, which I did in the morning.  It is in the afternoon, I am going home, I – there is a filling station across the way from Megawatt Park, I go to the filling station and I was filling in petrol and this Maserati pulls up next to me.     This Maserati, a black …[intervenes]     It pulls up next to me.     Says to me pull over.  It was Mr Salim Essa.  So in the side there are parking spaces, I had parked next to …[intervenes]     At the garage.     At the garage, it is in a public place.  He motions to me to get out and I get out and he says to me why are you not supporting the return of Matshela Koko?     Why are you not supporting the return of Matshela Koko?     I was taken aback because of the meeting that happened before.  He could recite verbatim what I had said.     At the meeting with the audit and risk committee.     Which was a telephonic meeting.     What I had said at the meeting.  So I was literally quite shocked and I did say – you know, it took me a while to compose myself because the first thing I thought was, how the hell did he know what I had said?  The Commission investigators actually highlighted it to me, he may have been on the call.  And I said that may well be, I would not know because I only arranged for the directors to be on the call. However, I then said to him – said, you know, why are you – I said to him well, that man is not fit to be CEO and he said to me I promised – I promised – no, I must just get the sequence right, I am sorry.  It was quite quick…     It was quite a quick and a very significant …[intervenes]     Ja, I am just trying to – I am not sure if I wrote it in my affidavit.  He then said to me – because I said to him there is no way that Matshela Koko could become CEO and he should never come back to Eskom, you know, the board would be derelict in its duty if he did come back to Eskom.  And it was at that point that he said to me what do we need to do to bring him back?  I said there is no way that he can come back, you know, he is just – he does not belong in Eskom.  By that time I had discovered just exactly what the man had been involved in, in terms of the tender manipulations, etcetera.   And he said to me name your price and we will do whatever you say.  And I said there is no price that will - you know, will make me help get you – help you get him back. The next minute, and I do not know the precise timing, it happened quite quickly, the next minute he says to me, I will offer you 800 million if you help us and we will do whatever you say.  And I looked at him and I said do not be ridiculous and I actually scoffed and burst out laughing and got into my car and just drove away.  I was quite – I was quite shocked.     Yes.     Yes.     I told parliament about it, it did not make it into the public state – into the public arena because it was overshadowed by my meeting with Ajay Gupta.     It was in my consultations with the evidence leader.     I did not do a formal affidavit to parliament because they called me so quickly and also because of the – so what you have from me as a statement is actually what the evidence leader called an evidence guide.  So I did not make any affidavit to parliament.  The transcript would contain what I said.     That was subsequent to this meeting.  Salim Essa then called me.     Salim Essa.     The very Salim Essa, he called me and I must admit, Mr Chairman, I was quite, you know, surprised and I was morbidly curious as to why he would call me after I had turned him down.     It would have been about a month later.     So he called me and that is when he talked about the Molefe matter and how is it going with the Molefe matter?  And I said Brian is going to lose that matter.     Brian is going to lose that matter.     Yes, it was.     And then he said to me can we meet for coffee?  And I was - I must admit I was curious as to why – why would you want to meet with me for coffee now, I told you I do not want anything to do with you.  And he just said let us just, you know, have coffee.  I – then once again, it was arranged for the African Pride Hotel, it is in Melrose Arch and that he arranged to meet with me in the reception.  I went …[intervenes]     No, no, no, at the hotel.     Okay, so it was not in his office.  We met there and then he took me – he said let us go over to – I am not sure how it came about, in terms of let us walk to the office.  And I said to him well, I do not have much time, I have another appointment.  We walked – what I thought were offices, were in fact townhouses.  They were behind Melrose Arch, in the precinct because we could literally walk from the hotel to the apartment, to that block.  And he opened the door and we walked in, into a lounge type area and in the lounge area …[intervenes]     That is correct.     Well, I only found out when he opened the door that it was an apartment.  I then realised, I thought it was …[intervenes]     Well, he said let us walk – and I thought it was an office in the direction that he was going because that is what it looks like from the outside.  There was a restaurant in front of - I think there is an Ocean Basket and there is, you know, there are a couple of restaurants in front so I thought it was an office. As he opened the door I then realised that this was actually not an office, it was an apartment.  As I walked in, the curtains were drawn, so it was not very brightly lit but in this room, in the lounge area was Ajay Gupta, Duduzane Zuma, Minister Ben Martins and an Asian lady that I could not remember her name because they did introduce me to these people.  I just – at that stage I was in total shock as to what I had walked into. Salim then continued to introduce me to Ajay Gupta and to Duduzane Zuma and to – obviously I knew Minister Ben Martins, so greeted him and to the lady that was there.  They then asked me – he then asked me to sit down and I think Salim explained to him in vernacular, Indian vernacular, I am not sure which language I would be but he explained something to Mr Gupta and then Mr Gupta sort of sat back and said – he replied something also in the vernacular, but I could not understand.   The next question was - you know, Salim Essa then said to me just tell Ajay what was – well, he gestured to Mr Gupta, tell him what was happening with Brian’s case.  I just said, in terms of process, I said we were going to see the judge, Deputy Judge President’s office the next week which was – I think it was the 1 s t or the 2 August the date had not yet been confirmed and that we would be discussing the case management of the matter and I did not say anything else.  Mr Gupta then responded, but not in particular to me, I think he was talking to the people in the room, you know?  He just said this – you know, we would need to find someone in the Deputy Judge President, DJP’s office to move this case out.  And what was more significant for me - I mean, that was already one of the shocking statements - but then he – the next one he said was, when this matter would be easier to deal with, when Nkosazana Zuma comes into power and it was at that moment that I realised that whatever scepticism I had had about the Gupta family influence on – on the country issues, you know this was it.  I did not need any more evidence.  I was not, I thought you know forget whatever else you wanted to know, this was it.              I tried to stay as composed as possible, because I was extremely – I mean all sorts of thoughts went through my head, you know was this a trap, what were they wanting, I had already turned them down, are they going to kill me you know because here I am in a place, nobody knows, because I had told my family I am going to Marro Lodge, you know would they find me, those – so all those things go through your head when you sitting there and I had Mr Zuma sitting on my right hand side and it is like okay you know just get out of here.             And if you read my testimony you will see that I describe Ajay Gupta sitting there in an old T-shirt and a tracksuit and bare feet and that just made me even more angry that – and he was unshaven very slovenly and I am thinking this man is sitting here and thinking that he owns the country the way that he was speaking.  They – he was quite dismissive after that he spoke to Mr Essa and once again in vernacular and he just you know he took his hand and just dismissed me like that and he walked me out to the door Mr Essa and I just walked away.  I tried to get away as fast as possible, got into my car and went home.  It took me quite a while to process what had happened.  I really did not speak to anybody about it until I spoke much later to my attorneys as to what was going on.     Yes, I was also acting head of legal.      Oh my apologies yes that is correct.       Mr Chairman at that point in time I did not believe that the board was bona fide.     Yes.      Yes.      From about late 2016 there were a number of incidents that – well more particularly it started with the Public Protectors report where the…[intervene]     The State of Capture Report.     I think it – yes.      I had – the board had received a summons in respect of appearing before the Public Protector.     Prior to the report being…[intervene]     Unfortunately it was a very short space of time and we did motivate for an extension of time but what the previous Public Protector did ask for were the conflict of interest registers which I was the custodian, my office was the custodian of.  So we had – you know the registers for each meeting.  I then compiled that for the Public Protector and it was through that that we – the first signs of the conflict, the various conflicts of the people were then exposed.             And I had released those reports, those documents to the Public Protector without informing the board.  Now my reasoning for doing that was firstly I had been summons by the Public Protector so I really did not have any reason to explain to the board why I was doing that because I was compelled by law to do that.  Secondly I felt that these were real time records so once you completed it there was no need to change it.             You know it was at each meeting and there was regularly - when you as a director had to update your records you would inform me and I would ask at each meeting if there were changes.  So for me there was no need to actually ask permission and I gave that to the Public Protector.  So it came out obviously in the report the difference and I think from that moment the tension between myself and the board escalated because many of the board members, the implicated board members were extremely irate that I had not asked permission and I said I did not need permission these were company records you know.  So that was the beginning of that kind of tension.  It escalated with issues such as bank accounts being frozen, where one of the board members actually – there was a meeting where the Minister was called, Minister Lynn Brown was called.             She in fact was on a telephone conference where the board members were complaining that their bank accounts were being investigated and that they were being declared politically exposed persons etcetera.  And it was at that point that she came on the call, there was a decision that she you know she would assist where if possible and I am not quite sure how that meeting ended but subsequent to that meeting that very day one of the board directors called me and said to me that she was extremely angry because her accounts – I think it was Nedbank was threatening to freeze her accounts.             And she said to me that if these people think that I am going down alone they have another thing coming this board is owned – everybody knows that this board is a Gupta board and I will make sure that everybody knows.  Ja, and I should…[intervene]     Do I have to…[intervene]     No.      Alright.     Yes, and I was actually quite speechless.  I – she ended the call and she phoned me back I think it must have been about an hour later and said…[intervene]      No.     Mr Seleka’s question as to why did I not go to the board.     Why did I not go to the board.     And so unfortunately now it has taken.     Well, I did not trust the board any longer.      And that is why I was explaining, yes.     Yes, when you talk about the fourth meeting I assume you talking about the July meeting.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      That is correct Mr Chair.      I was either at home or…[intervene]     No, I was not at work.      Yes, this was over the weekend.      Yes.      Yes, at the African Pride Hotel.      Hotel.      Mr Chairman as I earlier alluded to I was actually morbidly curious at this point; this was the same…[intervene]     Let me explain.     No, Mr Chairman remember I told you about the meeting in the parking lot at the fuel station.     At that meeting he had offered me R800million.     Well I found it quite astounding that someone that I had turned down so flatly…[intervene]     I say I found it quite astounding that someone that I had turned down so flatly.     I really was you know curious sir because I could not understand why would he want to have anything to do with me.      Well like I said earlier I had – I did not participate in…[intervene]     I say I did not participate in the Saxonwold visits.  I was not offered bags of cash or provided with bags of cash.     Well that was late 2017 Mr Chairman, it was a different time.  In my view it was more an act of desperation, their bank accounts were being frozen.      Well for me the timing of it you know was just an act of desperation.     Well I did not accept it.      Yes.      No, that does not make any difference but in the context because I mean the reasoning for the bribe was really to help get Matshela Koko to be chief executive officer of Eskom.     That is what he said at the time.      Yes, that is what he said.      Yes and Mr Essa said well I had promised Mr Koko well he said I had promised Matshela that he would be CEO.      Mr Essa is saying that and that is when I said well that is one promise you will not be able to keep.      Yes, that is correct.      I did after the July meeting.       No.      It was the pension matter.      Yes.      I am not sure.      It was much later but not – Mr Chair much later one of my colleagues told me that the DPJ actually did institute an investigation in his office based on the testimony that I gave in parliament.  He did investigate but I am not sure, if I understand what you asking if…[intervene]       Yes.      No, I do not know.      Yes please just repeat the paragraph for me.      Mr Chairman from – I joined Eskom in 2006 and from inception there was quite a contestation around procurement matters and just general interference in the day to day running of the utility.  My first experience of that was with the old order mining rights that Eskom had acquired.  As Eskom it had old order mining rights which when the new laws came into being that needed to be converted and as I was in primary energy I was tasked with coordinating and preparing those applications for conversion of mining rights.           It was a significant amount of mining rights, it would – and this is my personal belief, it would because they were coal mining rights it would have given Eskom access to its own coal mines and it would have alleviated a lot of the coal issues that we now experience as a country.  However, we went through a series of you know applications that I together with the then chief executive officer I think it was first Mr Maroga and then Mr Davis we went through having to submit these applications to the DMR. Then known as the Department of Mineral Resources and at that stage I think I was on the eve of submitting the documents for consideration when I was told not to submit those documents as a political solution would be found to those issues.             Those mining rights ended up in the hands of private companies and Eskom began the fight of trying to get them back with no avail.  There was also then an unofficial policy statements that Eskom cannot own a mine.  So that was one of my first experiences of political interference on the parts of the shareholder as I call it.  There were also others when there were – in procurement when there were tenders we were told you know so and so is behind it follow process make sure that you do this.             I recall in 2011 specifically I was asked to put together a list of the top hundred suppliers of Eskom together with their contact details and the person at the company because the Minister wanted to do an ANC fund raising campaign.  I still have that database but you know I was asked to prepare it and it was handed to the Minister.  Further things like there were instructions to the board around not following the public finance not the Public Finance Managing Act the PPFA.  Eskom had an exemption to the triple, which is the Preferential Procurement Framework Act.  It was due to expire Minister Gigaba and Minister Gordhan on the last could not agree on the extension because Minister Gigaba was Public Enterprises and Minister Gordhan was the Minister of Finance.             So on the eve of the expiration of the exemption we get a notice that says the exemption is no longer valid, will not be extended.  Minister Gigaba tells the board do not follow the instruction, us as officials say you cannot do that that is breaking the law, he get the board in that tussle.  And there are many more examples of that kind of interference in the granting of tenders.  The first nuclear tender for – was also the parties were going to sign, Minister Gigaba says no we will not, you will not sign it.             The parties were actually at the signing ceremony.  There was quite a lot of that kind of interference from the Ministry; from various political parties. The Chairman would get lots of you know meet with this one.    So what I am saying is I had always – we had always get instructed when you get this kind of instruction follow process.    Do not waiver follow process.      Whoever my boss was at the time?    It was still…    Yes.  So we would – you know make sure that we have – we follow the process.    He had on occasion yes because we had some interference.    Um the affidavit was about – I am – suspensions and ..    Okay.    Yes that is correct Mr Chairman.  That – that interference took …    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    It was the Investment and Finance Committee and then the Board.    yes.    Yes.    Yes.      Yes.    That is correct Mr Chairman.    No he did not.    Yes.    Yes.  That is correct.    Yes Mr Chairman I would just like to also add that you know in the beginning I – I did not quite believe that three brothers would control the state in the manner that they did.  That would be coming clearer as we go along.  As I went along in my journey.  And that is precisely why I started speaking to the media firstly anonymously because I was not sure you know there was such an element of mistrust at work.  I did speak to my colleagues but because of that atmosphere that you did not know who was loyal to who it was very difficult to speak to the people inside.  Even – even matters that were you know sort of reported to the whistle blowing line.  The executives would know who they were talking about.  You know that would become knowledge. So that line was not very secure.  I started anonymously talking to some of the journalists in the beginning because I really did not know where to – to take the information.    It was – it was very difficult.  I did approach the – the recruitment agencies.  The fact that I had worked at Eskom was a blight on my record.  So that made it difficult.  I was also – I am a single parent so it was not that easy just to walk out of a job and not have a job.    So I think those were the - you know the compelling what shall I say the competing interest at the time for me.  But it was quite a difficult terrain to master – to muster because most of the people you know just ignored what – what you were – what one would say.    In – internally.  And it would only become clearer later that there were – stake – they were stakeholders so interested.    And that made it difficult.    It would be both.    No I was not.    No I did not.    No, no.  Mr Chairman what you...    Yes.  What you would have read is that maybe just for a point of clarification.  When I became Company Secretary those minutes had not been signed for a year.  So myself and the Board Secretary had to work through those and we prepared them for the Board – for the 15 for want of a better word.  And it was – and that is why it took so long for those minutes to be signed because we had to listen to all of the tapes.  We had to then – I had prepared a plaque for each Board Member to make sure that they could tell us that what was in those minutes because we were not present.  So I think you – the reason I refer to them in my affidavit is because I did read them.    Some of them yes.    Ja …    Ja at Eskom.  I split it between myself and the Board Secretary.    Mr Chairman that period was…    No.    No.    Why – ja.    No.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    That is correct but the process was even more detailed than that.     Mr Chairman what we did was.    Yes he did.    Yes.    Mr Chairman I – I do not recall speaking to him about the conversations but that happened the next morning.  But it was very possible that he would have called me at that time.  He had no respect for personal boundaries and personal time.  So I – I do not recall exactly what that – what that call would have been about but it was definitely not about the you know the – the telephone call.  What I can – if I look back at that day the most important types of things were like he was trying to finish off certain transactions and more than likely they would have pertained to that.    Dr Pat Naidoo is one of the Board Members – was one of the Board Members at the time.  He was also the Chairperson of the Build Recovery and…    This was on the 13 March 2015.    So I explained the process to Dr Naidoo in terms of we would need to if you request for a quotation or a request for a proposal.  Dr Naidoo listened and seemed to be a bit impatient about the process because for me my impression was that they had already appointed Mr Linnell and now needed to regularise the process.    That was my impression.    Yes he did and he did say that to me.  In fact you will see in paragraph 43 I think he had said the Board had acquired the services of Mr Nick Linnell.    I – I did not see a formal letter of appointment Mr Chairman but what I do know is that I was called upon to cancel the contract for Mr Linnell.    Yes.    This was late April I think.      It was in 2015.    Yes I am just looking for SMD3.    Mr Linnell’s letter is dated the 14 April Mr Chairman so it would have been around – it would have been subsequent to that letter.    Yes that is correct.    That is the document I am referring to.    I could give the gist if that suits the Chairman; I am not sure.    What Mr Linnell is writing about in this letter is the attendances that he did on behalf of the Board in setting up the inquiry and in participating and being part of the meetings.  He was – he was also to draw up the Terms of Reference for the inquiry that was to follow.  And then it later – I think it appeared in the newspapers that he was no longer going to be coordinating and that is when he wrote this letter to the acting Chairperson Dr Ngubane.    Yes.    Subsequently.    Yes based on that. He did issue an invoice to Eskom and Eskom paid it.    I think it was in the region of about R160 000.00.    Yes that is correct.    Yes that was paragraph 56.    Yes I actually am aware that he had to attend.    I am…    I am not sure Mr Chairman I – if my memory serves me correctly he also had to depose to the affidavit.    In the Matona matter.    He did go to – I was aware that he went to CCMA.     No, I ...[intervenes]      That I am not sure of at that stage.     Ja.     The board appointed Ms Klein, Mr Khumalo, Dr Ngubane and Mr Khosa.     As the delegation.     Ms Klein.     Mr Khumalo     Dr Ngubane.     Yes.  One, two, three.... yes.      Yes, that is correct.     I do not think I was in the meeting that was ...[intervenes]      But what I do know is because I had to deal with them ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes.     I attended the meetings.  I also... I took notes at the meetings.  I also had to arrange the meetings and I, in some instances, I liaised with the suspended executives to get them to the meeting.     I would not at that stage would have told him what were to be discussed but I... Mr Chairman, but I would have told him that the board delegation would like to meet with him.     Yes, it was a neutral ground off... away from Megawatt Park.  So I arranged it at... yes, the Protea Hotel in Midrand.     I would have to... can I refer to my...?     Yes, Mr Chair.  What they did as a group, they would decide who would talk to whom.       Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes.     That is, from what I witnessed Mr Chairman, there was absolutely no intention of those executives returning.  Well, for ...[intervenes]      The manner in which the discussions were conducted, except for the... there was a mark change when they dealt with Matshela Koko but for the three executives, Mr Matona, Ms Molefe and Mr Marokane, there was a totally different tone and posture in terms of how they would deal with it.       Yes, I am .     That is what I am seeking to convey.     Based on... I... it is in my notes.     That is the meeting of the board.     Which there are no recordings.     I think that happened earlier if I recall.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I have my handwritten notes ...[intervenes]      ...from the meeting of that date.     I have made available...[intervenes]      At the meeting.  Contemporises notes.     I have provided it yesterday, Mr Chairman.     I have provided it yesterday but we have spoken about it.      That is what I am led to understand.     Yes, Mr Chairman.     There are minutes of the meeting.     But from my notes, it seems that this was an in-committee meeting.     I was not the company secretary at that stage.     I took notes.     No, I did not attend the meeting with Mr Marokane because that would have been a conflict of interest for me.  He was my boss and I have spoken to him about the suspensions.  My meeting with Salim Essa.  So I did not ...[intervenes]      He was.  He was acting.     Acting ...[intervenes]      No, Mr Koko was acting in 2015.  It is a complex... the organisation changed so much.     Mr Marokane and I... he was my direct boss from twenty... I think it was 2009.     Until 2015.     So that is why I did not take part in any of this.      Oh, no.     Thank you.     I just want to get to my... I think the first expression to Mr Matona was that the court action did not sit well with the powers that be.  And I am quoting because I wrote down exactly what was said.     I think this is one of the two meetings that he spoke about, Mr Chair.     This one took place on the 4t h of May 2015.       I am not sure if this would have been the first meeting.     H’m....     It is not clear from... it is not hundred percent clear from the way I that I dotted my notes.     There may have been discussion before that.     The first one that I attended.     The first one was that the court action did not sit well with the powers that be.  This ...[intervenes]      This was said by Mr Romeo Khumalo.     They then, mister... as I said in my affidavit, Mr Khumalo then outlined a framework of a proposal to Mr Matona and ...[intervenes]      Sort of a framework of a proposal.     To Mr Matona.     And the proposal included a payment by Eskom...[intervenes]      Let me just check.  I am just going to check my notes if you do not mind.     Okay this would be Ms Klein.     Mr Khumalo.     And Dr Ngubane.     Ja.     No, at that stage what Dr Ngubane wanted me to do was to take notes when he was not there.     You will recall that he testified that he was going to employee engagement meetings.     So he ...[intervenes]      So he did not ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Take notes, organise the venue.     The logistics.     So I would take instruction from either Dr Ngubane or Ms Klein.     Yes.     And what he was talking about was, you know, and from my notes it seems like there had been prior discussions because there was no commitment now to a specific role in government because they were talking about his transfer.   The financial issue around what proposal they would give him and the messaging in terms of how would they communicate to the public.   And also, then did say the court action did not sit well with the powers to be and that one would have to deal with that, that matter.  Mr Matona then responded ...[intervenes]      Do you want me to read it?     Okay.     Yes, that is correct.  It was the 4t h of May.     Yes, there were a series of meetings on the 4th of May.     At the Protea Hotel.  Yes, that is correct.     Well, Mr Chairman at this meeting, this one was led by Ms Klein and she very early on set the tone of the meeting by saying... explaining to Ms Molefe that this is the delegation that has been put together to talk to the     Ms Klein to ...[intervenes]      ...to Ms Molefe.     To Ms Tsholofelo Molefe is, how do we find amicable find a solution.  Ms Molefe, obviously, responded by saying... you know, this was actually the first time that the board met with Ms Molefe or in fact communicated with her because she said there had been eight weeks of no communication.  And then Mr Khumalo took over and said in     I wrote my hand... these are my handwritten notes, Mr Chairman.  It is not that I have a super memory but I did write who said what and I did make these quotes.     You know Mr Chairman, Dr Ngubane actually did not ask for my notes if I recall now.      Yes, if I look back now, he did not ask me for them.     I would have given him, you know, verbal feedback but I think because there was this delegation of the board in any event, that grouping spoke to each other.     Yes, she did.     Mr Matona did say that he wanted his job back.     He did say that.     But the response was, you know, the court action did not sit well.  So it was implied that they did not want him back.     Well, he spoke about... at this meeting of the 4t h of May ...[intervenes]      He spoke about the impact that this had had on him and that he would want his job back.  But the discussion did not go that way.     Not at this meeting, Mr Chair.  It may ...[intervenes]      It may have been at a previous meeting.     But certainly by the time it got to this meeting of the 4t h of May ...[intervenes]      ...it was not about returning to his job.     No, not from what I have written down.     That I think was at a meeting.     Because here already the proposal is already in the formulation stage.     The meeting was markedly different to the others.     She – I think the first issue for her was that there had been no communication whatsoever.     I think the first issue for Ms Molefe was that there had been no communication whatsoever so she did not have an understanding of where the inquiry was, what her position was, you know, she – the impression I got is that she did want to come back.     Yes.     Just my impression at the time because this was actually – for her, the 4 May was the first meeting that she had actually spoken to the board.     Well, it was at that meeting that they had already spoken about how do we find a solution for you to leave.     So that is how the meeting started.     Yes.     Because it said - what was asked to her was, can we find a way of amicably parting ways?     That came from the Eskom delegation.     Not from her.     She said – because it ended with would be open to this discussion and also the public management thereof, that was the delegation quote.  And she responded by saying Eskom had already appointed lawyers in the matter so it puts her at an unfair advantage – I mean, put them at an unfair advantage and the trust issues are so deep so it would be something I would consider.     Yes.  Oh…     This one was on the 11 May 2015.     Mr Chairman, this meeting was markedly different in that it was hosted – it was hosted by Mrs Klein and Mr Koza and there was quite collegiate familiar, you know, sort of bantering beforehand and it was – it was opened by Mrs Klein with sort of – even though the correct words were like without prejudice and off the record, it opened with how do we treat people and things like that.  So there was a tone being set, you know, which was different …[intervenes]     It was more collegial than the others.     In terms of they came in, they sat down and the next question is, how are we going to part ways.  This one, there was banter, it was – ja, it was just – the atmosphere was different.  He was also given time to explain and he went into, you know, great lengths of saying thank you for the opportunity for being heard even though he reserved his rights and things like that and he once again went on about I really do not understand why I have been suspended, you know, but he would not make it difficult for the board if the board thought that he should not come back.  So it was very much – and I think that he was shocked and he could not understand why he was where he was at that point.     These are words that he used.     In this presentation because he was allowed t6 actually present to the board.     No, I thought he was acting.     He was a very good actor.  And, you know, it was about – he could not understand where he was and it is at this meeting that, you know, he coined that phrase that Eskom is my veins, the blood in my veins is blue, those kinds of things, so he really went to town. And they actually indulged him in terms of explaining.  Of course he did come with the narrative of the reason for his suspension was because of Mr Tsotsi and his animosity with Mr Tsotsi.  So that came – that was in the narrative.  I think then what was important, he also, you know, pointed out his career in Eskom and things like that. So there was a lot of that.   Ms Klein then also thanked him for being very honest with the board and so did Mr Koza.  They both said thank you for the explanation, thank you for sharing this knowledge with us, this was a totally different tone to the other meetings, none of the other executives where  - meetings, where I had been present, had ever had this kind of dialogue or exchange.  And then the question came from Ms Klein as could you fully trust this board again?  And he responded that he would be able to – that he was confident that the issues of the previous board were resolved and that he would be able to work with this board.     I think that…     Ja, that is what I...     That is incorrect in my view, Mr Chairman, because they were not given the opportunity  to even, you know, articulate it properly that they wanted their job back, they were just – the first line in the meeting was, how do we part ways?  So even if they were considering coming back, there was just no opportunity for them to do so.   Mr Koko was asked would you trust this board and would you be able to work with this board again?     Mr Chairman, I do not know the minutiae but from where I was sitting, that was not the approach of the board.  This delegation was appointed to exit the executive and more particularly Mr Matona, Mr Marokane and Ms Molefe.     Yes. Mr Chairman, I addressed that in my supplementary affidavit.  Those letters which she attaches were drafted purportedly on the 10 March.  I did have a template of the letterhead so I could accept that I would be the author, listed as the author, but if you look at the data presented on there, there are a couple of red flags on that, on that metadata that she presented. Firstly, the letters are printed before they are created, they are also talking of hearings of suspension which did not take place, on their own evidence, and it would be impossible for me to have worked with someone that I had just met.  So you will see in my affidavit I said I question the authenticity of those letters.     Mr Chairman, my only supposition as to why these people needed to be exited from their position was to make way for Brian Molefe coming to Eskom and the eventual transferring to Anoj Singh as well because those were the positions that were open.  Mr Koko came back to generation, I think he was moved from procurement and engineering.     From group technology and commercial.  He went to generation when he came back in Brian Molefe’s time.     Yes, that is correct.     One of the factors is that while these negotiations were – discussions were continuing, the board – Mr Molefe had already – Mr Molefe, Brian Molefe had already arrived at Eskom and in fact on – I think it was the 4 May he had in between these exit negotiations, the board delegation had a meeting with Mr Molefe. I do …[intervenes]     No, no, that was a different meeting.  It would be paragraph 62, Mr Chairman, of my affidavit.  Because, as I say, in between the meetings a meeting with Brian Molefe also took place.     On page 40.     This was on the 4 May, the very same day that the delegation met with Ms Molefe and Mr Matona.     Yes.     Yes, she literally parachuted into the office that day.  If I recall, I was standing at the CEO’s – next to his desk delivering some documents and the next minute Minister Brown comes literally flying in with Brian Molefe in tow.  The Chairpersons of Eskom and Transnet I think arrived a little bit later.  You know, there was a time difference but they – that is he literally was parachuted into Eskom.     Parachuted into Eskom.     Mr Molefe.     Brian Molefe.     He arrived with Minister Brown.     On the day that …[intervenes]     …Mr Seleka talks about.     Is it the day that he arrived?     That is fine.     That is correct Mr Chair.     I am not aware of how he was seconded Mr Chairman but I did have to administer the process of regularising if that is what Mr Seleka is asking.     Administer the process, put the paperwork in place.     Of the secondment.     Okay.     I would also prefer because it actually is quite detailed Mr Chairman.      And I would like to put a full picture before you.     Yes, that was explained to us Mr Chairman as employees by Ms Klein and Mr Tsotsi.     That is correct.     I did not deal with the appointment of Dentons, I was interviewed by one of the Dentons team members.     Yes I was. ADV SELEKA     Because one of the areas was primary energy and procurement, I got interviewed on those issues.     At the time of the review it was Matshela Koko, Acting Group Chief Executive – Group Executive, my apologies Mr Chair.     I did watch the testimony of Ms Klein Mr Chairman so I am well aware of what she testified.  I am also aware of what she puts on affidavit because the Commission provided it to me to respond and I do have a response to that.   Mr Seleka’s question is just a bit complex, as most matters at Eskom, so I am not sure where to start Mr Seleka, I would just need guidance from you.     Mr Chairman I want to unequivocally tell you that the versions of the Dentons report that you have and that the Commission has is not complete.   There has been an original version that was destroyed, and the reason I say that is because I had sight of that version by virtue of the fact that I was in the office of Dr Ngubane.   That version which for the purposes of just as I say was complicated I am going to call the original version because that is how it is referred to in the minutes, but that original version is non-existent in today’s time, and I say so because I had to read it at the time, it was a presentation, it was not in a formal report yet, it was a presentation through the Board of Eskom and it detailed the tender manipulation, the criminality that was associated with one Matshela Koko and it went into detail into the interviews that were conducted, so there was quite – it was quite a damning report but any Board should not have discarded at that stage. The report spoke about the other divisions, it did speak about you know how we could improve processes around primary energy, diesel purchases, the financing, it actually did not find any fault for want of a better word with the way that the finances were reported you know because there were external entrances.  Group capital it spoke about how we could do things better in terms of project management, which were things that were already being addressed in Eskom.   The primary areas that were really, really unpacked were the procurement areas of which Matshela Koko’s name featured prominently as to how the manipulation took place.  That version was then collected and destroyed.   I found an electronic version, well I thought it was, on my computer which I did hand to the Commission, but I don’t we could have broken the code to that, but so that is why I am saying my testimony and why I am passionate about saying that original document and that the Board deliberately destroyed.     I thought it was a version, I am not sure because it is ...[intervenes]      No.     Yes that is correct Mr Chairman and I have handed that to the Commission.     It is not clear from the records of Eskom that we went through.   But from my recollection it wasn’t in report form, it was in presentation format and it said these are the findings that are coming out.      Yes, that would be a good way to describe it.     Mr Chairman it is not clear from the records of Eskom whether that was in a meeting because the copy that I was you know was presented was handed to me by Dr Ngubane so I wasn’t – I am not sure but in the minutes you will see, and I refer to them and I say in paragraph 88 of my affidavit.     That these details did not make it into the official records of Eskom as it was decided by the Board that it would be destroyed.  This is recorded in the Board     And that is why I say that that original report – I am not sure you know they talk about initial reports, and they talk about original versions but for me that version has not made it into the official records of Eskom.      Yes.     Yes, that is my contention Mr Chairman.     Unequivocally so that because you will see that the reports that I have provided to the Commission the preliminary report and the final report are very similar because the Board actually stopped, instructed Dentons to stop the investigation, so those two reports even though they are two reports, they are very similar, there is not much difference, I think the dates are even the same because they say instructed to stop as at this date.     Yes.     Yes, the big difference lies in the influence on particular contracts.     Particular specifications, manipulation over a period of time.    This was hard copies Mr Chairperson.     These were not emailed.     These were hard copies.      Yes.  So Mr Chairman that is the resolution that I quoted it is actually on page 49, it is item     Yes.       “Members considered the media expectation with regard to the outcome of the Dentons investigation and supported that the report be released to the Minister with a covering letter from the Chairman of the Board articulating the next steps.  Copies of the final report would be delivered to the members, the Group Executives, the Chief Financial Officer and external auditors.   However concern was expressed with regard to the collection and destruction of the initial reports. The Company Secretary was expected to take the necessary steps to ensure that all original reports were collected in exchange for the final reports.  In view of this concern the Chairman of P & G, Ms Veneta Klein, undertook to ensure that all reports were returned to her within seven days for them to be destroyed.     Yes, that is correct.     Mr Chairman these were extracts of minutes, you will it is noted extract, I am not sure why it is signed but this one comes from my personal file.      Because I kept the minutes or I kept some in my records so the original should be signed.    There should be a signed version.     Yes, the Board was much aware of that because I would not be able to – I would not have been able to converse with the Minister in the manner that I did had the Board not been availed of that information.    Deputy Minister of Public Enterprises.      Yes, he denied it immediately the next morning, I woke up to a press conference being held by Minister Martens, I am fully aware that he had denied it.     Yes Mr Chairman on the 19 t h of May this was after these discussions with the suspended executives the – Ms Klein and I am just trying to – here – Ms Klein opened this discussion by saying that they needed to find settlement with the parties because they needed to clear the decks, and I put that in quotation marks because that is how I made my notes.   She also confirmed that the shareholder has approved to get rid of the people and make the necessary concessions if it is suits out the problem.  And she stressed that the priority is to get the people off and away. The meeting then discussed the various settlement arrangements that had been put in place and it said that the minister had a ceiling of R12 million to negotiate and that there were...  The guiding principles were as follows, as I put here that there would be... that they would be able to do full cost-to-company for up to 12-months.   They would be able to pay trance eight and trance nine.  That was in relation to the incentive, the long-term incentive scheme that executives were on.   They would have... there could be a contribution to the legal costs and a communication plan around the suspended executives could be negotiated.      My notes do not reflect where this took place.     This would have either been at the Protea Hotel or at Eskom.     This was Ms Klein, Mr Khumalo, Dr Ngubane and Mr Khoza.     Mr Khoza.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I see that.     I accept that.     Because he took us... he took Eskom to court.     He took Eskom to court.     To court, yes.     Yes, that is the date on here with the 7t h(?).     Mr Chairman, the notes from the 19 t h of May were not... was to inform the brief.     The notes from the 19t h of May that I have did, informed the brief because I, in my preparations for the Commission, is when I discovered by notes.      Okay.  I would have to ...[intervenes]      As of the 19t h of May.     The 19t h of May.     My notes says to TM.     And then there is a question mark.     And to be confirmed.     [No audible reply]      The final meeting, yes.     Yes.     Yes, the meeting had taken place.     Already.     That is correct, Mr Chairman.     Mr Chairman, my scenario is that it was put to them ...[intervenes]      ...we want to part ways.     Okay.  How amenable are you to that?     Okay.  Even though I drafted this, this would have been signed off by the chairperson.  So the language would be different.     But what I am saying to you today - and that is why I gave you what was given to the minister – what I am saying to you today is that the executives were not, except for Malesela Koko, the executives were not given a choice.   They may have expressed they wanted to come back but that was not, to use Mr Matona’s words, that was not on the table.  So you know, that is what I mean.     I am just giving you so that you can see they have the full picture of what occurred.     Mr Chairman, with the greatest of respect, Dr Ngubane and Ms Klein are lying to this Commission.  They distorted the truth.  Ms Klein was at the forefront of wanting to get rid of the executives, in her own words.  Dr Ngubane played this person behind the scenes.   From what I witnessed, there was no intention.  Other than Malesela Koko, there was no intention to bring back any of those executives.     Mr Chairman, my understanding was.  Mr Koko was on suspension at the time and he would have faced disciplinary action.  And had the disciplinary action run properly, he would have been fired.   And I think that what Mr Essa wanted was manipulation of that process. You will see in Malesela Koko’s parliamentary testimony, he only refers to the report that exonerates him.  He does not go further than that.   We all know... I spent a lot of time... there were senior counsel appointed to actually run that disciplinary.  The board overturned my selection of senior counsel.   The charge sheet was tampered with so that there were gaps.  And that is why the disciplinary ended up, you know, being such a sham.       Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.  He was on suspension because of that Impulse International.     No, no.       That...[intervenes]      2017.     A separate.     He was acting Group Chief Executive already.     And this was why you will recall that ...[intervenes]      I would have assisted with the choice of chairperson and evidence leader and I would have assisted, you know, getting the evidence together from the Eskom side.  And I would have worked with... then once that had been prepared, it would have been handed over to the Industrial Relations Team.       And that is what I did in the beginning to choose, to make sure that the evidence bundle, the charge sheets and everything were correct and were handed over for the IOR Team to run.       No, it is not correct.  But they did offer, I think if I recall, they did offer him, you know, a letter.     They did give him a letter.     H’m...     H’m.  What would you call it?  Just an indication of what the settlement package would look like.     Yes.     If he wanted to go, yes.     That Mr Koko wanted to come back?     Yes, that is correct.     It is not.  It is not correctly.     That is correct.     [laughing]     Mr Chairman, at the time, there was a settlement negotiations ongoing with Mr Marokane and there was ...[intervenes]      Yes, that is what I was ...[intervenes]      Ja, that is why I am saying that was not correct.  The approach was made by the board.     That is correct.       Yes. 
HEFFERMAN: Sean Hefferman from Hefferman Attorneys appearing on behalf of Suzanne Daniels. 
DANIELS: Those were the two attachments ...[intervenes]    Yes, Mr Chairman, that was my understanding.   Mr Chairman I am responding to…[intervene]     Interested parties in – in what was happening.   Build Recovery and Build Program Committee.  So I was called to a meeting with him.  He asked to see me and he wanted to know what would be the process to appoint Mr Nick Linnell.  He said that…   Because at the meeting of the 23rd of April 2015 ...[intervenes]    You know, the others were more adversarial.   Generation was responsible for the managing and operation of the power stations. ADV SELEKA     Mr Chairman the redacted version happened in 2017, February 2017. At the time I did talk about it in my supplementary affidavit.  At the time, late January, we were hit with a number of PAIA applications and also a set of media questions by the former investigative journalist Sikonathi Mantshantsha who is now the spokesperson for Eskom.   He sent a rather detailed I think it was about three page of questions and we had a number, I think there were three or four PAIA applications at the same time.    The Board had decided to release the final Dentons report, but at the same time had asked me to get legal opinion on how do we do that in terms of the PAIA provisions etcetera, and were we allowed to release those documents as is, you know without – because we hadn’t notified the affected parties, even though the report was not incriminating there were names of companies and earnings and things like that in there, and the initial reports show that while we could release Eskom employees and Eskom officials we would need to notify the companies involved etcetera, and the preliminary legal opinion was shared with the Board.  The recommendation was that we redact those names from the report that was to be released to the public and it is that redacted report that was then released in 2017, there was no malice intended, it was purely based on legal advice, I do have the files, I will make it available to the Commission, the legal opinion stating why we did that.   I would not have been, I actually also sent it to the Minister on the 1 s t of February because the immediate conference was set for the 7 t h of February so I sent her a copy of the speech, a copy of you know the documentation and the rationale as to why we would be redacting the document on the 5 t h of February and I said this was a preliminary legal opinion.  I would not have been able to send that to the Minster had the Board not been aware of that, so that is why I contest Ms Klein’s version in saying that you know she makes it appear as if I redacted out of my own volition and just made it appear on that day. In fact on the day of that press briefing Dr Ngubane asked me to explain to the media why we had redacted the document, so I do have those documents available.   It was not done out of seeking to hide information, it was done on the advice of counsel. 
COUNSEL:   Chair, I think I need to consult on certain aspects of her evidence.     I had to in any event.     Indeed so.
