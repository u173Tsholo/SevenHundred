CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Hm.    Hm okay.  Thank you.  Counsel for Mr Zulu.  They must just sanitise the podium before you – you.      Yes thank you.  Just for the record you can just place yourself on record again.    Hm.    Okay.    Thank you.      Yes.  Ja.    I am sorry do not speak too far away from the microphone.    They are so – if you are too far away, I cannot hear.      Yes.    Yes.    I do not know whether the bundle you have is the same.    Ja – yes.    The first affidavit of …    Ja.    Yes.  And it may be that if you read.    Oh okay.  Yes.    Thank you.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Yes.    Unfortunately, the letter does not give a reference so that one could see who within the commission prepared it.  Of course, it is signed by the acting secretary but she signs a lot of letters that come from different work streams and different units of the – of the commission and I would have like it if there was an indication as to the reference.  I – I – but I – I suspect looking at the letter that it may have been prepared by somebody within the legal team who may have been involved in – in the Dukwana – in the Free State Asbestos matter.  That is my – but the letter does not give an indication.  But – I think continue to make the point you wanted to make.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja, no.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Well by – I think by 13 December he had – he was no longer involved in the commission so it may be other members of the legal team.    Who were involved.    Or somebody who was involved.    But that is fine.  That does not necessarily say anything about the point you want to raise.    Your point is – you received or your client’s attorneys received a letter from the commission and this is what it was saying.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    I have seen it.    I have seen it yes.    Maybe I must just say this before you move away from the – your client’s complaints about how he has been treated.  I do understand that there will be an affidavit that – the response to the allegations of how your client has been treated because I would like to see a response to the allegations.  So I cannot say much now but I have read what your – what the allegations are and I understand that at some stage there will be enough evidence that will be – that I will look at to see what the response is.  And then I can only say something once I have seen that.    Ja.    Hm.     Well I know I have got no less than two affidavits from your client.    Is it the one with seven pages?    Or you mean the first to be provided to the commission?    Well Mr Pretorius has got the same bundle as myself he might be able to tell me where – where I find it in the bundle.     150.  That is Bundle FS1 page 150 and 150 refers to the black numbers hey?    Yes okay.  Yes I have got it.    Yes.    Well – my paragraph – my paragraph 7 starts with “I wish to make a number of”.    That is the one ja.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Is that what he regards as an application for leave to cross-examine?    That one sentence?    And he does not have a right.    He only has a right to apply.    Not a right to cross-examine.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes but I am – if you rely on this sentence to say there is an application for leave to cross-examine, I think you probably will have difficulty.    Because he is not applying here for leave.  He is just stating what he believes – what right he believes he has.  What he does indicate is that to say the least he has an intention.    To cross-examine probably that part.  But on the face of it it would seem to me that if this is what is relied on, he possibly still needs to make a proper application for leave to cross-examine.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Well – well let us start where probably we should have started namely what the point of your address is.  I think the point of your address is that you are applying for the postponement of the hearing of your client’s evidence.  Is that right?    Or not?    Yes but I just want us to be on the same page.     Is the purpose of address to apply for the postponement of the hearing of Mr – of your client’s evidence?    Yes.  And the basis for that application is that he seeks to cross-examine Mr Dukwana and he believed that he had filed an application for leave to cross-examine him.  He was told that that application would be held in abeyance.  He believes that he should – that application should be decided first before he gives evidence and gets questioned.  That is the basis is that right?    Yes.  Now I think that the – in part your application is based on a certain sequence of events.  One of which is that your client believes he – if he is going to be granted leave to cross-examine, he should cross-examine Mr Dukwana first before he can give evidence, is that right?  Obviously if his application is unsuccessful, he would say okay I will go into the witness stand and testify if – is that correct?    Yes, no, no but that is what I am saying.    I am saying first he wants – he says his – he believes he has a pending application for leave to cross-examine Mr Dukwana.    He believes that should be decided first.    Before he can be called to give evidence and to be questioned?    And if his application is decided first obviously it can be that his – it is granted or it is refused.    If it is granted, he would further in – say he must first cross-examine Mr Dukwana before he takes the witness stand.  If his application or leave to cross-examine Mr Dukwana is unsuccessful, I take it he will say okay then in that event I would take the witness stand.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm    Hm.    Hm.    Well I – my recollection from even last year is that your client’s concern was largely – largely revolved around a certain amount of money that was reflected in the spread sheet as having been given or intended to be given to somebody with certain initials.  I am not sure if there was any other concern at that stage that he raised.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    But as you stand there is the position that for all intents and purposes as far as you know your client’s concern arises from Mr Dukwana’s evidence in relation to what was in the spread sheet?    Yes.  Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.  Is that the one relating to the car?    Is what you are talking about allegations about a car?    Oh ja okay.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes, but from what I have read, it seems to me that your client is ready to deal with any of these allegations from what I have heard.   The impression that I have is that he is ready to deal with all of these allegations.  It may well be that he would prefer to cross-examine Dukwana before he takes the witness stand.   But when I read all these affidavits, I certainly get the impression of somebody who is ready to say, “Bring them on.  I will answer these.  I will deal with all of these.”   That is the impression I get.  It may be a wrong impression but that is the impression I get.    [laughs]  Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  No, no, no.  I ...[intervenes]     H’m.  No, no, no.    Yes.    Ja.  Okay.  No, that is fine.  I think I understand what your client is to say.  I would like to hear what Mr Pretorius has to say.   As we speak, my concern is that if the witness has had enough time to deal with the issues and as put in his affidavit, it may be that it is not something that should warrant postponing his evidence.  That he might prefer to cross-examine a witness before he gives evidence.   Number two, there is the problem in that, as I have indicated, on the face of it, for me, if reliance is placed simple on that one sentence, the way he says, “I insist on my right to cross-examine”.   That if reliance is based on that to say there is a pending application, there might be difficulties with that.  I accept that you received or he received a letter from the Commission which seemed to think that it was an application for leave to cross-examine.   But I will hear what Mr Pretorius has to say.  Those are my current thoughts to say there might be difficulties.  But certainly to the extent that there might be doubt about whether that is an application for leave to cross-examine if he decides he does want to file an application or file documents or affidavits, that will make it clear, he is applying for leave to cross-examine, that could still be done.  He might have to file a combination application to the extent that it might be outside the time limit but there is no bar that says you cannot do it anymore.   He can explain the position.  And it may well be that if he gets evidence, by the time he finishes, even he is satisfied that after sufficiently... with whatever Mr Dukwana said, I think... I do not think maybe I should bother about cross-examining anymore.   But also, it might emerge that there is very little in terms of disputes, disputes of fact.  Remember that with regard to Mr Dukwana and amounts of money which were reflected in the spreadsheet, remember that he was simple talking... interpreting what he was seeing there.   And there, in regard to your client, there were just certain initials, certain amount.  He does not know... he did not know anything, as far as I recall, beyond that and except knowing various of government officials who had something to do with the Asbestos Project.   That, as far as I recall, that is about all that I think he was saying, you know.  He could not be definitive about anything.    Ja.  H’m.    Ja.    H’m-h’m.    No, I am sure he is not being called for the sake of it.    Ja.    No, I do not think it is coming to... down to that.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Thank you.      Yes.  Okay, you just want to... ja ...[intervenes]     Ja.  Yes.  H’m.    Yes?    Well ...[intervenes]     Well, remember that you could... remember that it would be permissible to have a situation where a witness has implicated you and you give evidence without cross-examining that witness. And it would happen where your application for leave to cross-examine has been refused and properly so.  So the whole thing does not exclude... the whole scheme does not exclude that happening.    So you could have a situation where you have to come and give evidence without cross-examining the witness who has implicated you.  So from that point of view, assuming that you are correct about saying Mr Dukwana’s evidence would stand, then in that way, it stands.  By the time you come and give your evidence, you have not cross-examined.    No, no.  I am talking about the principle.    In law... in law ...[intervenes]     ...within the context of the Commission where there is no right to cross-examine ...[intervenes]     ...but you have to apply for leave to cross-examine.    Some applications would be granted.    Others will be refused.    So you... what you... the point you made was simple that if your client gives evidence without Mr Dukwana being cross-examined, you will be given evidence in circumstances where Mr Dukwana’s evidence has not been tested.  And I am simple saying, legally within this context that can happen.    Yes.  Look ...[intervenes]     Yes.    Ja.  Well, of course, it is unfortunate that there has to be an argument whether there is an application for leave to cross-examine.     But we all know that what you rely on in terms of the affidavit and what you rely on in terms of the Commission’s letter ...[intervenes]     ...that of December 13t h.    Yes?    Yes. ADV DAYAL    Yes, okay.    Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    And that, of course, it seems would make... that, of course, it seems would suggest that there would be hardly any justification to postpone the hearing of Mr Zulu’s evidence today, just so that he can cross-examine somebody who gave evidence on something that he is not going to be questioned about today.    Ja.    Ja.  H’m.    Thank you.  Any reply from counsel for Mr Zulu?  Thank you, Mr Pretorius.  They will sanitise the podium before counsel for Mr Zulu goes there.     Yes.     Well, he says – let us say what he says, Mr Zulu, on the basis of what Mr Dukwana may have said he will be questioning him on the basis of the product of the investigation of the Commission subsequent to Mr Zulu having brought to the attention of the Commission certain things and he says Mr – it is not going to be helpful for Mr Zulu to really cross-examine Mr Dukwana for purposes of today because he would be questioned on the basis of the product of the investigation conducted by the Commission.  Ja, that is what he says.     Well, that includes that, I think.     But I do not know if you want to – if you can make it the only thing.  He says it is the product of the investigation of the Commission and it is not really so much about what Mr Zulu may have said – Mr Dukwana may have said about Mr Zulu.     Well, if he has no issue with it, you will say that he can say that – if he asked anything about it, he can just say I have already said I do not dispute what they say.       That is it.     Ja, okay.     It may well be that to the extent that your client may have already at the date – I think Mr Pretorius said the 28 July.  If at the time he had already received a summons – and I do not know if he received a summons or just a notice but it may be that within the context of a summons it would have been expected if – it would have been expected that if you client was – or believed that he should be allowed to cross-examine first, cross-examine Mr Dukwana, that he would say because I have issued a summons I will appear there but I want you to know that I will appear but I will still argue that before I give evidence I should be given a chance to cross-examine Dukwana.  I do not know whether that is what he means in that context.   But, you know, it just seems to me that if for purposes of today Mr Dukwana – what Mr Dukwana said plays no role at all or play a minimum role that there is no reason why we should not continue and Mr Zulu should give evidence.  That is that because your entire application for a postponement was really based on saying he is now going to be asked about Mr Dukwana’s evidence and Mr Pretorius says but that is not what is going to happen.     Yes.     Okay, okay.     Well, I can tell you this about being instructed to issue a summons, we have recently been experiencing a lot of difficulties for a long time from 2018 and last year we mostly simply requested people to appear without issuing a summons, it did happen with regard to certain people and the approach was informed by – or the approach was if people are cooperating there is no need for a summons, okay?  But of late there have been certain challenges and the fact that we have a very serious time constraint so recently I was even saying – I think it was in an open hearing, maybe the Commission should issue summons against everybody irrespective whether you are cooperating or not because sometimes somebody is cooperating and then something comes up and because there is no compulsion it is easy to then change whereas if there is a compulsion then you know you cannot change that.   So there are certain challenges.  It might not reflect on a particular individual if a summons is issued, it might be that if we want to make sure that we minimise the prospects of our time not being used properly.      The best thing is to issue a summons and if you receive a summons do not feel bad that – do not think that the Commission thinks I am not cooperating but sometimes the summons even protects you when somebody else may be your superior at work, might say hey, hey, hey, no, something else has come up now so you can say that is a summons, I have to go there whereas if there is no compulsion you might be prevailed upon to not come, so – but I am just mentioning that to give the context but I think coming back to your application, as we speak, my inclination would be to dismiss it because it was based on Dukwana and Mr Pretorius says the evidence or the questioning really will not be based on Dukwana.     And you may still have another point.  I am saying that is my inclination.     If you have another point you can still put it, ja.     Okay, okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Okay.     But there is no – even on your own approach, there is no application that your client has lodged for leave to cross-examine anybody in regard to any evidence other than Dukwana.  So – and from what one can see and Mr Pretorius also made the point, your clients knows exactly what the issues are in regard to the other evidence that is not Mr Dukwana’s evidence, he has answered questions, he has not say no, I need more time to answer these questions, he has answered the questions.     Yes.     But if I postpone, for what purpose would I postpone?     If we take out Dukwana.     If we leave Mr Dukwana out of it.    What would be the purpose of postponing?     Okay, I will give you three minutes to conclude, is that fine?     You have no further submissions.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay, thank you very much.  The application brought by Mr Zulu for the postponement of the hearing of his evidence is dismissed.  If reasons are asked for, they will be given.  We will take the tea adjournment now and it is twenty eight minutes pas eleven, we will resume at quarter to twelve.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, are we ready to continue?     Okay please administer the oath or affirmation.  Mr Zulu you might wish to either remove your mask or move it a bit otherwise the transcribers will not hear you.  Yes, okay.     Thank you, you may be seated.     Just tell him Mr Pretorius that when you refer to page numbers you will be referring to the black numbers on the left of each page.     Hang on Mr Pretorius we are going to be using bundle FS1.  Is that right?     I have requested…[intervenes]      This be written on the spine although it was not with me.  So if all others can be reading bundle FS whatever so that one would know that FS1 refers to the bundle.     Okay, alright.     So Mr Zulu when either Mr Pretorius or I refer to bundle FS1 we will be referring to this bundle that bundle that is in front of you and on the spine, you will see FS1 maybe it is not written bundle but that is bundle FS1.     And if you want to write it on the spine with you it is fine as well but if you will remember that is okay.     And of course, Mr Zulu when you nod that will not be captured in the transcript it is better if you say yes or no, okay.     Did you confirm that it is his signature that appears on page 155?  Is that your signature?     Okay.     Yes, okay.     Mr Pretorius is it not easier that we immediately you ask me to admit this as a certain exhibit?     Ja.      Ja, it is convenient to do it now.     TT5.1 or TT1?     Ja, 5.1 so the affidavit of Mr Thabani Wiseman Zulu appearing at page 150 and I am referring to that number will be admitted as Exhibit TT5.1.      It is 173, yes.     Yes, is that your signature there above despondent?     173.     Okay.     Are the…[intervenes]     Are the annexures separate from the affidavit to which there are annexures?       The one that you were dealing with now the affidavit starts at page 159 and goes up to page 173.     After that I do not have annexures, I have got another affidavit by Mr Zulu.     Yes, so that affidavit is also an annexure?     It is an annexure to this…[intervenes]      Okay.  If it is referred to in the affidavit starting at page 159 if it is referred to as an annexure I would think that we must leave it as part of Exhibit TT5.2 but if it is not referred to in the affidavit it would be a stand-alone affidavit even if it might have similarities in terms of content were said.      Yes.     Ja.     Okay.     No, okay that is fine.     That is fine.     Annexures to, okay.     Yes, yes I see it.     Ja.           I aim to find it.  It is a letter from the commission addressed to you at page 204.     Ja, ja.       Yes, I see you nodded you mean yes.     35, yes.       It is in the affidavit of Mr Mokhesi.     Remember to look at the black numbers all the time or page numbers, page 35.     Page 035 but we just say 35.     Yes, okay disregard Free State, disregard 01, disregard the hyphen, disregard the zero.  When we say 35 we just mean the last digits, two digits.  So we will not be mentioning all the things that come before it but if you look at the red page the numbers at the top is TT2.1 and NM508.     Okay.       Well I do not know about National Director General.  I think he was Director General of the Department of Human Settlements at national government as opposed to provincial.  Is that correct Mr Zulu?     Yes, okay.      Mr Zulu although it is Mr Pretorius who will be asking you most of the questions.  His asking you so that you can tell me.      Okay so…[intervenes]      Ja, I understand ja perhaps when you look this side when you speak then I do not miss anything.     I am not saying do not look at him at all, so you can look at him but when you answer try and look this side.     Yes, Mr Pretorius.     He just wants you to confirm that that part of the statement is correct.     Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.   So in other words, if a provincial department at the beginning of the year had its budget allocated to project A, B, C, D, E.    And somewhere in the course of the year a proposal is made or there is some project that they think they should also accommodate but that project would not have been part of the business plan that they had before they would have to change their business plan to take care – to cover this new project and seek the approval of the National Department, the approval of the change in the business plan and then because they cannot redirect funds from other projects to a new project without changing or adjusting their business plan.     And once they have adjusted their business plan that – then they can move funds from one project to the new project.  But for all of that to happen they need the approval of the National Department.    Okay.    Yes okay.  Somebody…    Somebody will give you the relevant bundle Mr Zulu – they will give you the relevant bundle.  Are the bundles behind Mr Zulu now all marked properly?  Okay so if he looks at – behind him he will be able to see each bundle.    Ja okay alright.  Thank you.    You will just have to repeat the page number for me Mr Pretorius.    181 okay.   If you want to read that letter to understand the context you can just take half a minute to read it.    Ja.    Oh, you would like to see the letter that you are responding to.    Okay.    Okay.    How is the lighting there Mr Zulu?    It is not good.    I just one second Mr Pretorius.  Will somebody speak to somebody I know I had said this light should be there and I know why they put it here but I wonder whether it is possible to get something.  I think this particular witness may be struggling to read some of the documents.  I do not know whether it is because of the poor quality of this specific letter it might be but, in the meantime, if something can be done about lighting for him that should be explored.  Mr Pretorius I interrupted you.    Oh it is the quality.    Oh okay alright.    Oh okay alright.  No at least if it is not the light that is fine.    I am sorry.  What page?    Oh the following page.  Yes.    Did you say we must move to another bundle?    Okay.    Your voice…    Yes.    Yes I.    Are you able – are you saying you are not able to remember sending this email but you are not necessarily saying you did not send it?  You do not have enough context to know whether you sent it, is that what you are saying?    Sorry.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh.  Oh.    Ja.  Okay.    Yes.    No I understand what you say.    Yes.    Ja.  So you – you …    So at this stage you are only able to say on the face of it.    It seems like an email I would have sent.    But I cannot be more definite than that.    Okay.      I am sorry.    Yes but what Mr Pretorius…    What Mr Pretorius is asking is your own understanding of what he was saying because you were to approve.    His motivating to you if there is something you do not understand you are not going to approve?   So he is saying, was this your understanding of what he is saying?    Yes.    Yes but from your side was the question of pricing not one of the things that you would want to make sure you understood clearly.    Before you could give your approval.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Mr Pretorius.    Well Mr Pretorius might think differently.  Mr Pretorius.     Just to make sure that we are all on the same page, I understand your answer when you say yes to that question, you say you are agreeing that what Mr Mokhesi is telling you here is that that rate of R850 per house excluding VAT includes all the items which are listed next to the various bullets points on pages 234 and 235.  We are on the same page on that?  Is that what he is saying?     No, no, no, your understanding of what he is saying, that is what Mr Pretorius wants.     Your understanding, when you read this.     And when you read it now.     You have a different understanding from the one that Mr Pretorius and I have.     Yes, but your understanding is same as ours?     Ja, that this is what he means.     If he comes here and says something else then we will deal with it then.     Okay.     Well, on the face of it, I cannot see it     Well, he has limited space, maybe that is the reason why he is asking.     If you are moving to another one he could take it off for the time being and he would bring it back when he needs it.     Okay.     Even myself I have limited space.     Ja.     Just repeat which document you are talking about, Mr…     Is it the letter, the motivation?  The motivation letter from the Free State HOD?     I think it is in the bundle that you have put further away from you.     That you put away.     Okay, alright.  Okay.     Oh, you had a meeting/interview with the investigators.     You have never met them.     Yes, okay.     Mr Pretorius, I think we are at one o’clock.  Shall we take the lunch adjournment?     Or do you want to complete something?     Okay.  We will take the lunch break and resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS    Okay let us continue.    Yes, but I think the... I think the point that Mr Pretorius seeks to make and wants to see what comment you have on it is that you asked for certain information ...[intervenes]     This is what was provided.    And if what was provided was not adequate for your purposes to make whatever decision you needed to make, you would indicate.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay Mr Pretorius.    Okay is your answer yes?    Because they could not proceed without your approval?    Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.    I think Mr Pretorius just wanted you to confirm his understanding.    That your approval was required, it was necessary and it was granted.    H’m.    Yes, but I think ...[intervenes]     Yes.  No, I think Mr Pretorius simply seeks your understanding of what the position was in terms of how... what was Blackhead was appointed by Gauteng to do because the Free State Human Settlements Department sought to rely on the fact that Blackhead had been appointed in Gauteng to do whatever and they sought to rely on that to say, “We are not going to go to open tender”.   Now from what you have told me, this project, it would seem, would never have gone ahead if it did not had your approval as well?    Yes.  Ja.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay no, it is ...[intervenes]     No, no, no.  That is fine.    That is fine.  I think that ...[intervenes]     But I think that... from my point of view, I need that clarification.    No, no, no.  I think everybody understand that.  But you see, you have indicated that this kind of project... there was... you used the word joint... joint... between the joint, I think, corporation, joint approval or whatever between the national department and the provincial department.  In the morning, you used that word.   So there needs to be some approval by the HOD in regard to a project in his department but there is also approval necessary in regard to certain things about such a project from yourself.  And my understanding, and you must just tell me again if I misunderstood, my understanding is, if the HOD for the Free State Human Settlements Department had thought that this was a good project, they should pursue it. But you did not provide your approval for the change of the business plan and so on and so my understanding is that it would not have been able to go ahead.  So am I... do I misunderstand the position?    No, no, no.  Do not tell me what you want to tell me.    I am asking you a specific question.  I have just told you what I understood your evidence to be.    Is my understanding correct or not of what you said?    It is correct.  Okay.  Then we can ...[intervenes]     No, no, no.  We can take it step-by-step.    That part is correct.    Okay.    But if you did not approve the change of the business plan, could the provincial department, nevertheless, proceed with the project?    Which would not be permissible?    So they could not properly or lawfully proceed with the project without your approval of the business plan at least?    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.  No, let us deal with it.    That does not stop them from doing what?    But ...[intervenes]     Yes, but ...[intervenes]     Yes.  Yes, but what we are talking about is.  In terms of what they are supposed to do in terms of the government procedures and authorities and the laws and the regulations, they could not proceed ...[intervenes]     ...if they did not have your approval of the change of the plan of the business plan?    They could not proceed in a regular way?    They would be doing something irregular?    Okay.  Alright.  Mr Pretorius, I hope I have contributed to the understanding of the position?    [laughs]      I think your answer was “correct”.    I do not think it was captured because ...[intervenes]     Ja.    Yes, yes.    Did you... bundle FS8?    Okay.      Yes.  Hm.    A panel.    H’m-h’m.    2149, did you say?    Mr Pretorius?    Okay.    No, that is fine.    [No audible reply]     [No audible reply]     I have got ...[intervenes]     Yes, I have got pages 214.1 to 2.1, 4.19.      Well, on the whole I think I am able to... well, maybe those that have got numbers or figures might be... but a lot of them that are somewhere in the first half of the document appear to be legible to me.  But as you move further then some are maybe difficult to read.    H’m.    Was the page on FS8?    Yes.    Ja.  No, we understand Mr Zulu.    Just to get onto the panel.    And then you might be on the panel for a whole year, you get no work.    Or you might get work.    Ja.     In other words, are you saying it includes all departments even those that have got nothing to do with human settlements?     Yes.     Yes.     Of the provinces.     Yes.     Yes.     They would be service providers from which you would pick those to give work from time to time.     Through a proper procurement process.     Even within the panel.     In other words, when you want to create a panel you have a bidding process.     And then when there is actual work to be done you are generally restricted to this panel.     But even with this panel there would be …[intervenes]\     A bidding process.     Okay and once there is work to be done that must be allocated where there must be a bidding process someone who is not on this panel would not be eligible to put in a bid.     Okay, only on the panel.     Yes.     Okay, because if you wanted to come onto the panel there was a time earlier.     When it was open and if you were interested you would have tried and then you did not succeed.     Okay.     I think the 8 will cause confusion, you said …[intervenes]     On 169.     Oh, FS8, okay.  No, that is fine.  FS8.     Page 169, okay, alright.     One second, Mr Pretorius, just to make clear what the letter says.  I think one has got to read it on     Yes.     I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry.     The answer was correct?     Okay.     Yes.     Ja, okay.     Yes but we do want to …[intervenes]     We do want to benefit from your knowledge as well.     Hang on, hang on, would you want to benefit from your knowledge and experience, you are the Director General of the Human Settlements department.     We are dealing with a project in the Provisional Human Settlements Department.     You, as an accounting officer, you understand the workings of government and its departments in regard to certain matters.  So now here we get the HOD of the Free State Human Settlements Department writing to Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd on the subject indicated there and he says he is seeking the approval of the CEO Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd that his department extend Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd’s current contract secured by National Department of Human Settlements in line with Treasury regulation number that, that, that.   Now we know that – or rather, I think when he refers to a current contract secured by National Department of Human Settlements, I take it he is referring to the subject of your letter that we have dealt with.     Yes.  Now on the understanding that that is what he is talking about, could he be correct to want to use that contract in this way?     Yes.     Yes.  To your knowledge …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     To give work, h’m.     H’m.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No, no, no, that is fine.  You see, most of the time what Mr Pretorius is asking for is just your own understanding of the position and somebody else might come and say no, no, Mr Zulu was wrong, he did not understand but what he was looking for is your own understanding.     Ja.  No, but …[intervenes]     No, no, no, that …[intervenes]     No, no, no.     That is a fair point but as long as everybody understands you are giving your own understanding.     That that should not be a problem.     Mr Pretorius?     Just repeat the page?     Oh.       Yes, but …[intervenes]     But we know what he is asking, it is in a letter.     For your approval.     Yes.     Actually, he is not even asking for approval, he is asking you to extend …[intervenes]     Obviously you cannot extend if you do not approve the extension.     Yes but let us go step by step.     You accept that he was asking you to extend the services of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd in line with this Treasury regulation.  You accept that is what he is asking?     What else could it be?     But he does not say that.  He writes on the basis that he knows that there is a contract and he is asking you to extend it, whether he is right or wrong is another matter but he says in effect please extend the services of Blackhead Consulting in line with Treasury regulation, blah, blah, blah, blah.     That is what he is asking.  Whether he is right or justified in making that request, that is another matter but factually that is what he is asking you to do.     Okay, Mr Pretorius, take it from there.     Well …[intervenes]     Let us leave out assuming.     A letter is written to you and you are being asked to provide approval, obviously you must understand what the request is about.     You must understand – you must interrogate the document to see whether this is the situation where your approval can be given or is necessary.     Okay.  Now is there any other way in which you understand this request other than that he was asking you to extend the only contract or the only basis or connection your department had with Blackhead namely Blackhead is on the panel?     That that is the only way you could understand it?     Okay, alright.     Page 181?  Mr Pretorius?     181?     No, 181, I think he says.      Just check whether you have got the right bundle, Mr Zulu.     Do you know what that contract was for, the Gauteng contract…[intervenes]?     Okay.     Alright.     Okay, Mr Pretorius?     Yes.     Your own understanding?     No, that’s fine.      Just repeat the page please?      Okay.     Sorry – a comfort break.     Yes okay.  Mr Pretorius let’s take a comfort break, ten minutes?     Two minutes, well let’s not make it two minutes because by the time you’ve reached the door, two minutes might be over, we’ll make it ten minutes, we’ll return at half past.  Or maybe before you go, Mr Pretorius, in terms of planning the afternoon, what’s your suggestion?      Ja, well from my point of view, I can sit till late it’s just that I have a planned zoom conference at six which I can move to seven and so on.  So, I’m just wanting to check whether – what your own thinking is then of course we’ll check with Mr Zulu as well.      Oh yes.      Oh, no, no I may be double booked, the one I’m thinking about doesn’t involve you and it’s not Commission work.    Ja, okay – okay, maybe let’s take the adjournment so that Mr Zulu can have some comfort then when we come back, we can finalise in terms of how long we can sit this afternoon.  Let’s take the adjournment, I’d say let’s return at twenty-five to four, we adjourn.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Let us talk about our planning for the rest of the afternoon and if need be into the evening.  I have been given some information that makes me understand what Zoom Conference you were talking about Mr Pretorius.  I think my understanding was that the member of the legal team was organising that was to come back to me and confirm whether all the people that were supposed to be involved in it had confirmed their availability.  That had not happened that is why I did not remember. But I have given a message to my Registrar to communicate with him with a view that if everybody is available, we could look at seven or half past seven but when we come out of here there would be communication.  If they are not available then we can fix another time.    Ja.  No, no that is fine.  I just wanted to – it is just that I want to know how far we can go this afternoon.  I can make adjustments and I am quite prepared to sit beyond four o’clock, beyond five o’clock if.    If everybody is fine with that.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.  Okay then that is fine.  I just wanted to have an idea.    Then – then – then in that event even if – we will talk separately about this Zoom Conference in which you – you would be involved if you are available.    Ja okay.    Okay.  And it should not take long it is a very practical issue that is to be discussed.    Ja.  Okay thank you.    What page on F – on Bundle FS?    Oh.  I have been given FS9.  There must have been a misunderstanding.    FS8 page 39.    Ja that is where I was before I was given that one.  I thought you might have changed your mind.  Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Do you know it is written here Maklene I suspect that there must be a misspelling.  It might be Mabheleni Ntuli.    Do you know anybody that might be called Mabheleni Ntuli?    Yes and that would be spelt M-a-b-h-e-l-e-n-i that would be Mabheleni, is that correct?  That would be the correct spelling.    In terms of spelling that would be correct ja.    Yes.    Yes so what I am saying is when I look at it here it is spelt in a way that seems to me to be unlikely to be correct.  Because he say it is an Isi-Zulu word/name so it is likely to be Mabheleni and Mr Zulu does say he does know a Mr Mabheleni Ntuli.    Well I have said that in Isi-Zulu if you say Mabheleni it would be M-a-b-h-e-l-e-n-I but you could have other people writing it as M-a-b-e-l-e-n-i.    I am sorry – I am sorry that answer might not have been captured just repeat it.  The question was…   Whether Mr Mabheleni Ntuli is a businessman in KwaZulu Natal?    Yes.  Ja.    Ja.  So are you saying to the extent that Mr Sodi may have paid R1 million into the account of SMD Trading Group and wrote TZ.    But that was in regard to a car that went to Mr Ntuli you say you do not know anything about the transaction of the car.    But you do know that there is a Mr Ntuli.    That you introduced to Mr Sodi?    To Mr Sodi.    And that is Mr Mabheleni Ntuli.    Okay thank you.    Ja you were not a beneficiary of anything.    In their transactions.    Okay.    Yes okay. ADV PRETORIUS    Maybe I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Maybe you can share with me Mr Zulu the context in which you introduced Mr Ntuli to Mr Sodi?    Just raise your voice.    Hm.    Hm.    You actually?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.  The introduction happened at your business in Pietermaritzburg or did it happen in Gauteng?    In Gauteng?    Yes.  How long had you known Mr Mduli at the time ...[intervenes]     ...you have introduced him to Mr Sodi if you are able to remember?  For many years or for a short time?    Yes.    Are you able to remember when it was in terms of year when you introduced Mr Mduli to Mr Sodi?    You would not remember?    Okay.  And the context was because of business or just because you happen to be ...[intervenes]     ...in the company of one of them and the other one came?    Ja.    Okay.  Alright.    You do not know but you ...[intervenes]     If he says that is what happened you would accept that?    Yes.    But TZ is one of them?    Okay.    Your lounge is called TZ Lounge?    Okay.    That was paid by Sodi?    H’m.    Okay maybe it is the mask.  I am not hearing the part about R 90 000,00.  Just repeat that.    Yes.    Yes.    The R 600 000,00?    Yes.    Okay I think he is ...[intervenes]     Ja, he is just asking... I think he knows that the R 600 000,00 was paid by Mr Sodi.  I think he is asking about whether you paid the R 90 000,00 or not?    H’m.    Yes.    Ja.  Okay, okay.    Ja.  No, you can say whether you accept for your benefit part or not but he wants you to just confirm.    Yes, yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay I certainly would like you today to give me as much information about that R 600 000,00.  How it originated?  What was the whole thing about?  As possible.  And if there are documents that support what you are telling me in regard to that amount, telling me about, then they can be provided in due course but I would like to know as much as possible about it.    Ja.  Yes.  No, Mr Pretorius will ask question aimed at giving... you giving me that information.    H’m.  Okay maybe Mr Pretorius, you must start a little earlier.  Tell me about this business that you have talked about, TZ Lounge?  What does it do?  What is done?    H’m.    You sell...?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes. Is it based in town in Pietermaritzburg or is it in one of the township in Pietermaritzburg?    Is that Imbali Township or...?    Sobanto Township?    That is where it is based?    Okay.  Alright.    You did declare it, yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    [laughs]    Well ...[intervenes]     ...the debt, tell me about it because you said Mr Sodi was paying an amount that he owed you when he paid this R 600 000,00 into SMD’s account.      What had he done... what was the debt about?    Of what?  Of liquor?    Yes.    He used to be...?    He used to be at KZN?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    What was he running?  What was his business for which he needed... he would have needed liquor or did he have a function?    To...?    Oh, to entertain his own guests?    Ja.  Would this have been... would this have been liquor that he had got from your business over a certain period or would this have been one order, like for one function?    It would have been over a certain period?    And are you able to remember roundabout when it was that he had ordered liquor?    H’m?    Mainly in 2015?    Yes.  By that time, you had known him for a long time?    You had known him for about three years or so?    Yes.    And did he have an arrangement with your business in terms of which you could deliver liquor to... your business could deliver liquor to his... to him and he would pay later?    Yes, yes.    And was that a written arrangement or are there documents about the arrangements?    There will be, yes.    Yes, yes.   Yes, there were other customers ...[intervenes]     ...who might have run up big amount of debts?    Yes, okay.  So the whole amount at the time that he made this payment of R 600 000,00, was that the last amount he owed you or was there still some that he was going to pay?    Six hundred and...?    And four thousand?    Okay.     Yes, so …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.  Ja, I think…     Ja, ja, I think that is better.  So he owed you R604 000.     At the time you gave the instruction.     That he must pay R600 000 to SMD account.     Just seems strange that he – if he owes you R604 000 you do not ask for him put in R604 000?     Oh, in terms of the …[intervenes]     Oh, the R4 000 he could pay directly to you? MR     But the R600 000 could go that side.     Did he pay you the R4 000 afterwards?     Into your account?     With cash?     Okay, alright.  So you say there were other businesses or there were other people who also would have had a similar arrangement with your business in terms of which they could owe you quite large sums of money for liquor.     Yes.     Yes, yes.       Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  And the documentation that you say you do have in support of your version that this was a debt or loan, I think said a debt, what documentation do you remember as documentation that you have that you could make available to the Commission.     Ja.     Okay, alright.     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Pretorius?     Is your business a company, a CC or when you say T Z Lounge or is it a sole proprietor business, you own it as a person and it is not a legal entity on its own?     Sorry?     T Z Lounge.     So it was you trading as T Z Lounge?     Yes.  And you are the sole owner?     At that time together with your wife?     Oh, okay.       No, no, you did mention earlier together with your wife, ja.     Yes.     No, no, I understand, ja.     Sorry, sorry, sorry.     Yes, okay.       Yes.     Yes.     But you know, Mr Zulu, I have got to put this to you in order to be fair to you so that you can deal with it.  You came last year, was it August, or your lawyers came, you put up an affidavit.  Arising out of Mr Dukwana’s evidence, as I recall, which had – in which he sought to link you, I think, or maybe I am being unfair to him but …[intervenes]     Ja, he was using a certain …[intervenes]     Ja, a spreadsheet.     And on his understanding to say at least there was a possibility that certain initials there were referring to you.  There was a possibility on his thinking and in that context – I mean, if that – the amount reflected there in that spreadsheet against the initials that we are talking about, if that amount – if those initials represented you and if that amount was paid to the person represented by those initials would be you, that would be in your account if it was paid into your accounts, okay?   So the context in which you were saying the investigators can come and I will cooperate, I will show them my accounts, they can look at my accounts, I was not paid any money.  That was the context.  But for me here is the point.  I would have expected that if you knew that there was money that came from Mr Sodi’s business or from my Sodi that was paid, I will say for argument’s sake, for your benefit or was paid to you even if via a car dealer, that I would have expected that you would say you people, I can tell you that I never got any X million rand that is written there and those initials do not represent me, my accounts, you can come and have a look but what I can disclose that there is a some money that Sodi paid that I instructed him to pay.  He did not pay it into my accounts, this is where he paid it for, this is what it was about.  That is all I can tell you.  You do not even have to come and investigate; I can tell you there is money that I got from him but these are the circumstances under which I got them.  But you did not say that.  You just said you can come and have a look at my accounts, I will cooperate, so somebody can say you are able to say that because you knew that no money went into your account, the money went into SMD’s account.  Do you understand what I am saying?  So I thought I must just put that to you so that you can deal with it.     Ja, yes.     Okay.     I am sorry what page?     I am afraid you will have t repeat the page number now that I have got the bundle.     Page 519?     519 towards the end, right towards the end.     Yes, I have got it.     152 you said, hey?  Well, there is an affidavit of Mr Zulu’s that starts at page 150.       Okay.     I think you may be misunderstanding what he’s saying.     I think he’s talking about the R600 000.     Ja, hang on, hang on, he’s saying – he refers to this paragraph and in particular he refers to that last sentence which says, “I unequivocally tendered to the Commission without the necessity for any summons to provide my banking details and those of my wife or any other information that the Commission may require of Mr – to substantiate the fact that I received no money whatsoever from the aforesaid project at all”.  I think what he wants to say, and maybe I’m wrong but let me put this to you…[intervenes].     Ja, hang on let me finish, I’ll give you a chance, I’ll give you a chance.     The R600 000 that you instructed Mr Sodi to pay to SMD, do you relate it to the asbestos project or not?     You don’t?     Okay, but do you accept that the payment of that amount was to your benefit.  Now I’m raising that deliberately because earlier on Mr Pretorius said, we can discuss later because maybe you’ll say, no it’s not a benefit, but I want to put this to you. If somebody pays back money that they owe you, is that not a good thing for you, that your money is back?    Yes, but when people don’t pay…[intervenes].     Ja, no I’m not sure, we might be talking at cross-purposes.  I’m just testing our understanding of benefit in this context.  So, I would be inclined to think that the R600 000 that was paid by Mr Sodi, to you was to your benefit, simply because when somebody who owes you doesn’t pay back what they owe you, that’s prejudicial to you but when they pay back that must be good for you and therefore I’m thinking, to say that it’s for your benefit it’s fine, leave out the question about whether it was from the project or from what but just say, somebody pays back money that they owe you, it’s to your benefit, you agree?     Okay, alright, Mr Pretorius?     Yes. MR     The spreadsheet, no, no it’s fine.     Yes, yes.     Ja.     Okay, yes.     Yes okay.     Well you’d be here for the R600 000.     Yes, no, no that’s fine but you are not being suppressed from expressing what you feel but as you say, between counsel in the morning, myself and your counsel and Mr Pretorius, Mr Pretorius made certain undertakings which he, I think seeks to hear but I think you have made it clear that, to the extent that Mr Dukwana may have linked you to any benefit in the spreadsheet that you are not – you are denying any such link, that you have made clear.     Yes okay, thank you.     Ja I think you make a legitimate point Mr Zulu about the fact that you offered to cooperate and if the investigators did not ask you, that must be noted.     I’ve said to Mr Zulu that a note must be taken of the fact that you did offer your cooperation.     And I said just a few minutes ago, if the investigators did not come to you and ask you questions, a note must be taken of that.     But isn’t the fact that they did ask you about this R600 000?     Is that not a fact?     Is it not a fact that you did respond to that question.     Yes, you had an opportunity to tell them more about this transaction if you wanted to but you didn’t and they didn’t ask you further questions, is that right?     Yes, yes.     I think you may be right about that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     I think you may be right that the communication may not have been the best at all times and maybe partly because of that, certain things might not have happened the way they should have, I’m not sure.  I just wanted to make the point to acknowledge that, certainly, they did put the question to you and you answered, maybe they should have followed up but it may be that from your side too, you should have said, here is more to clarify this or whatever but it may be that, as you put it, there was a challenge with the communication and that resulted in the situation.     Yes, okay.     That remains yes, no thank you very much.     About the gap in communication.     It was paid by Sodi.     Yes.     Yes.     Hmm, okay.     Is that its Mr Pretorius?  Mr Zulu, thank you very much for coming to give evidence and thank you very much for re-committing yourself to assisting the Commission and even personally dealing with the investigators for any further information that they – that relates to this amount or any other thing that, you know, you may think is relevant or they may pick up, thank you very much.     Yes, okay, no – and maybe I can ask this, I know I was also – I had started to thank you so that you can be excused.  Your relationship with him, that Mr Sodi, is it on the basis of him being a friend or not really?      Yes, okay.     And Mr Mthuli also, is not a friend, he was just a customer.       An association?     Okay, alright.  Thank you very much Mr Zulu for coming to assist the Commission, we appreciate it.     The investigators will communicate in order – so that we can get whatever documentation is relevant, thank you very much you are excused.     Thank you.  Mr Pretorius, you talked about the other witness being excused or what is the position?     Yes.     Yes, do we need to start a little earlier than normal or not really? Page 219 of 219     Okay, alright.  Okay we are going to adjourn them until tomorrow morning at ten, we adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    By agreement three witnesses have been set down for today.  The first is a Mr Zulu.  He is represented and you will hear from his counsel in a minute.  The second is Mr Manyike and the third possibly will not be called Mr Duminy from SMD Motors.    Chair under 1 at page 150.    Yes Chair.    Thank you, Chair.  Chair, we take issue with the current application, whatever its implications are on two fundamental basis. Firstly, Mr Dukwana is not the star witness before the Commission in relation to these issues.  Nothing that will be put to Mr Zulu, hopefully today, will deal with the evidence that Mr Dukwana gave. It is true that he put a spreadsheet, a Cost of Business Schedule.  He did it as a whistle-blower.  He could not testify to it with authenticity and he gave evidence of a largely speculative and hearsay nature. That the legal team and the Commission... Commission’s investigators have put aside entirely.  They have made their own investigations.  They have done their work. And it is at those investigations and that work that has already been put to Mr Zulu in the questions, it is that investigation and the product of that investigation that we will deal with in questioning, hopefully today. So there is an entire break between what Mr Dukwana said on the one hand and what we are dealing with today with Mr Zulu. The Cost of Business Schedule by way of an example has been put to the witnesses and has been authenticated, as was said in my opening address.  You will recall in my opening address, not one part of that opening address refers to the evidence of Mr Dukwana. So the idea that Mr Dukwana must be cross-examined on the basis that he could not... cannot deal with the authenticity of the schedule is an entirely collateral to the issues that will be dealt with. The issues that will be dealt with today with Mr Zulu are entirely based on investigations that happened after Mr Dukwana. Mr Dukwana could be criticised.  He could be dealt with on the basis that he did not know what he was doing when he put up the 10.6.  That he was speculative. It is not going to assist you Chair to reach the decisions that you must reach about this matter.  You will have to evaluate investigations, what witnesses say about those investigations and a host of documentary evidence.  There is no link between what is going to happen today except a historical fact.   Chair, the questions today will deal with, firstly, Mr Zulu’s participation or facilitation of the Asbestos Project in the procurement process.  Mr Dukwana is entirely unhelpful in that respect and gave no evidence in that respect.   The second is Mr Zulu’s participation or facilitation of adjustments to the provincial budget something that Mr Dukwana cannot help at all.  No cross-examination is going to assist in that.  And the third is.  We will deal with two payments.  Not any allegation that appears on the Cost of Business Schedule but the product of investigation with the motor car dealer in Pietermaritzburg in two payments.  One of R 1 million and one of R 600 000,00. Again, entirely unrelated to anything that Mr Dukwana says.  But I am happy Chair to give you and my learned friend an undertaking that I am not going to deal with anything that Mr Dukwana says. It will be entirely documents obtained through the investigation and evidence obtained in regard to this spreadsheet from other witnesses.   In fact, Chair, the Cost of Business Schedule, I do not intend to deal with Mr Zulu at all.  I am dealing with entirely different evidence in that regard.  That is the first issue in respect of which ...[intervenes]     Indeed Chair.    And in fact, it does not take much speculation.  One can look at the allegations made by Mr Zulu in both his affidavits.  He says, in essence, in relation    In the course of the last two weeks, I have asked for a full response to be prepared.  That has been prepared.  It is part of the bundle that we can give it to...  But that, however important it may be to Mr Zulu and however important it may be to the Commission, Chair does not go to the central issue of today’s proceedings and those are the three areas that need to be covered. The second point is that Mr Zulu is not been taken by surprise.  He knows what issues are going to be dealt with.  He has been presented with ten documents that he has been given an opportunity to consider and consult with his lawyers. So his agreement to appear on 6 August 2020, is understandable in that context.  I must say that the correspondence between the parties is quite cordial and polite and constructive. What is not, in our view, very constructive is the tone and content of the various affidavits but that can be dealt with in due course. The former point I have made.  One more... two more points Chair.  This is not an adversarial process.  It is not a trial where you allow one side to win and one side to lose.   Mr Zulu is not here in a contest against Mr Dukwana or anyone else for that matter which can be won or lost.  The formal rules of court proceedings do not apply in a commission. You, Chair, will decide it in a matter that best assist you to make findings in relation to your Terms of Reference and that requires both a procedural set of considerations, as well as, a substantive set of considerations. And the answer is, what is going to assist you Chair to get to the bottom of the allegations today?  And to allow the witness to answer and ventilate his answers to the product of the investigations that have taken place on those three issues.  Those are our submissions Chair.  We must proceed.     Thank you, Mr Commissioner.     Thank you Chair.   Mr Thabani Wiseman Zulu is as it were on the stand, may he be sworn in?     Not a good time for that to happen, my apologies.  Morning Mr Zulu.     Mr Zulu you have in these proceedings submitted two affidavits.     The first affidavit appears at page 159 of the bundle marked Free State 1.  You have it in front of you?     Mr Zulu if you look at any page in that bundle you will see in the top left-hand corner Free State 01 and then a number.  Can you see that?     And in the top right-hand corner you will see numbers in red those are for record purposes you do not have to bother yourself with those numbers.      So when I refer to a page number, I will be referring to the number in black in the top left hand corner of each page.  So the first affidavit that you submitted to the…[intervenes]      Correct FS1.  I don’t know if your spine has yet been…[intervenes]      Amended.     That instruction has gone out, Chair.     In any event…[intervenes]     And Mr Zulu if it is easier for you, you can lower your mask when you speak so that we can all hear.      So if we go Mr Zulu to FS1 the bundle in front of you at page 159 you will see an affidavit.  That is your second affidavit but perhaps I should do it in order…[intervenes]      So let’s start I am sorry at page 148 you will see a cover page.     Do you have that?     And if you go to page 150 of FS1 you will see an affidavit.  Do you see that?     If I may ask you then to identify the signature on page 6 on page 155 rather.  Is that your signature?     That is your signature?  Would you speak up please Mr Zulu.     Do you know the contents of this affidavit?     Are they as far as you are aware…[intervenes]     He did say so but not loudly enough for the stenographer to hear.     And then if we go to Exhibit TT5.2 on page 157 please.     Yes please.     I would have done it at the end but now it is convenient.     Would you Chair admit the affidavit which appears in bundle FS1 at page 150 and the following as Exhibit TT1.      Sorry TT5.1.      And then if you go please in the same bundle FS1 to page 157 you will see there the cover page of another exhibit, Exhibit TT5.2.  Do you see that, page 157?      And if you go please to page 159 you will see the first page of another affidavit that is Exhibit TT2 together with all its annexures.      If you would please identify the signature then at page 159 sorry not page 159 my apologies that is the first page…[intervenes]      Yes.     Is that your signature?     And as far as you are aware the contents of this affidavit are they true and correct?     There are a number of annexures to the affidavit which appear in the following pages and we will come to those in the course of your evidence.  But if I may draw your attention to one of the annexures at page…[intervenes]      …204.  I am sorry Chair.     No they follow on Chair from the affidavit.     Yes.     Yes, that affidavit is in fact his first affidavit which is annexed to his second affidavit.     Yes.     Yes, it is a repeat of his first affidavit.     Yes, well in the further affidavit the one beginning at page 159 of the first one.     That is paragraph 2…[intervenes]     He said on 23 August 2019 I had to first do an affidavit in response to a notice in terms of rule 33 that I received on 5 August 2019.  For ease of reference I attach it to be marked Annexure TWZ1.1…[intervenes]      A copy thereof…[intervenes]      So that is all there with its annexures.     And it has its own annexures to.     And I would like to draw your attention Chair to an important document amongst those annexures it appears on page 204 of Bundle FS1 if you would go there please its Annexure TWZ8 to the affidavit that we don’t refer to that now we will just refer to the page number it is marked with tab 8, Chair.      With tab 8.     That is a copy of a letter sent to you by the commission on the 14 t h of May 2020.      Now that letter was sent to you and your answers to the questions are contained in the letter.  So this is actually not the letter sent to you this is your response because in each paragraph 2.1 to 2.2 and all the following paragraphs in italics in a different colour font although it may not be very clear in this light Chair are your answers to the questions and we will get back to those answers.      And Mr Zulu we have a request of the Stenographer…[intervenes]      Thank you very much hey.  Alright I would like you to refer you - there is a short route and a longer route and I would like to ask you to comment on the statements of Mr Mokhesi.  You know Mr Mokhesi?     He is the head of department or was the Head of Department, Free State Human Settlement at the time that the events we are talking about occurred.      You know him?     Now he attested to an affidavit and I just want to ask your comment on the content there at a general level and your response would help the commission with its work and then we will if necessary, after that go to the original documentation.  But if I could ask you to look at page 35 of bundle FS1.     Page 35.     35, the black number.  We know and you would have come across this in the questions put to you by the investigators…[intervenes]      I am sorry.     Page 35, Free State 1 or FS1, page 35.     This is an affidavit of Mr Mokhesi and this is his evidence to the commission.      Just to place this statement that I am going to put to you in its context we know that as part of the asbestos project service providers joint venture comprising Blackhead and Diamond Hill made a proposal to the department, Free State Department of Human Settlements.            And this is the proposal that is referred to herein the pages that follow from pages FS135 and following and what I would like to draw your attention to is that this proposal for the present at least according to the evidence of Mr Mokhesi was made at risk.  If you look please at paragraph 13.3.2 on page 36 it says they and that is a reference to the service providers in the asbestos project undertook to execute the above work or mandate on a risk basis.            My understanding of this specific proposition was that they undertook the work subject to approval by National Department of Human Settlements and of course approval of a business plan relating to this project.  Now before we deal with that paragraph at the time that this project was underway 2014 and 2015, what position did you occupy in government?     Right, you were the Director General of the national department, is that correct?     And the arrangements we are talking about principally at least were arrangements between a service provider on the one hand we know that it emerged as a joint venture but that is something we can talk about at another stage and the Gauteng sorry the Free State we also deal with Gauteng, the Free State Department of Human Settlements.  There was a – the project involved those two parties, am I correct?     The outcome to that in a moment, I just want you to give some background.     Really for context purposes view.     And because we have not placed on record your position at the time perhaps, we should.  Your position at the time as I understand it was the National Director of Human Settlements, National Director of Human Settlements.     But this business proposal we know was made to the provincial department in the Free State.  This particular proposal for the asbestos project in the Free State, you know about that?     Alright.  Now if we can revert to paragraph 13.3.2 please. They that is the service providers undertook to execute the above work or mandate on a risk basis.  My understanding of this specific propositions says Mr Mokhesi was that they undertook the work subject to the approval by the National Department of Human Settlements and of course approval of a business plan relating to this subject.  Do you agree with that proposition?     Sorry your voice is very soft I do not mean to badger you at all but could you just repeat that please.     Alright.     So do I understand you correctly that this statement is a correct statement provided one understands that all projects of a provincial department or under the supervision if we can put it that way of the national department.  Am I correct?     Yes.     So the approval of the business plan would be necessary and that approval would have to be given by the national department before it could properly proceed?     Before any human settlements project can proceed at a provincial level it requires the approval of that business plan by the National Department of Human Settlement?     Right.  And if one then goes to…[intervenes]     Yes, sure. MR     And ultimately that is your approval?     Yes, and you were the Accounting Officer at national level were you?     So to take that one step further Mr Zulu the business plan as I understand it and please correct me if I have it wrong.  The business plan has the consequence that certain budget allocations are made in terms of that plan.  Am I correct?     Well you – let me put it to you this way so you can explain it in your own words.  What is the relationship between a business plan and the annual budget of the province?     Ah, so when a business plan is put to you and approved there must be an allocation in the provincial budget so that that plan can be carried out.  Do I understand you correctly?     The normal circumstances?     But there are circumstances when that does not occur and perhaps, we dealing with them here.  If you go to paragraph 19 of that affidavit on page 44.  There Mr Mokhesi refers to your involvement in this matter in the project in your capacity as Director General national and what he says is that Mr Thabani Zulu and I am referring to page 44 of FS1 at paragraph 19.1.  Mr Thabani Zulu was then Director General of the National Department of Human Settlements.  That is a correct statement is it?     Yes.     Yes, you did.     Then he goes on to say before a provincial department could reprioritise or amend its business plan it should make a motivation to the DGF national level to effect such reprioritisation which affects its business plan and ultimately its budget.            So let me put the following question to you before you deal with that statement Mr Zulu.  If as in this case, there was no provision in the budget for the execution of this particular asbestos project the budget would have to be amended as it were to allow funds to be released for the project.  Am I correct?     Okay, so it seems that like you and Mr Mokhesi agree but just to clarify.  In this case there was no budgetary provision for the asbestos project for 2014, 15 at the beginning of the year?     In order to unlock funds for the execution of the project from the Free State budget it was necessary to make provision now for expenditure in terms of a revised budget and that could only be done by the submission of a new business plan to the national department and its approval.   Is that a correct summary?    Please do.    I see.    So that is instructive thank you Mr Zulu.  I would like to understand it in terms of your answer so that we are clear what the position is.  You say that a province may have a budget for a particular year in general terms and that project then is or that budget rather is allocated to a number of projects?    In this case the evidence will be that at the beginning of the financial year no funds had been allocated to the Asbestos Project but you say there is a procedure whereby one can move allocations from one project to another particularly where money is not required for a particular project it can go to another project, is that correct?    But for that to occur the National Department must approve an amended business plan, am I correct?    The revised business plan yes.    Thank you.    If we could go then to another document. These documents appear in various placed Chair and I am going to have to move to Bundle FS8.    Page 121.    Yes Chair.    This is a letter addressed to Mr Mokhesi.    I am sorry.    Oh page – I am sorry.  Page 181 and take a moment to look at the letter please.      181.  FS8 – 181.      FS8 – 181.    Right.  This is what appears on the face of it to be a letter signed by yourself in your capacity as Director General of the National Department of Human Settlements.  It appears to be dated 13 August 2014 and it is addressed to Mr Mokhesi - Department of Human Settlements.  Do you recall this letter?  It has been discussed with you.    Have a look at it.    That is your signature.    Yes.  I am sorry I interrupted you.  You said that is your signature?  Mr Zulu?    Yes.      Right.  For the moment we will come back to it later in another context but for the moment if I may refer you to the last paragraph of that letter or the pen-    Well if you need to look at any other correspondence in order to answer the question, I am going to put to you of course we can try and find that correspondence.    For you.    But for the moment and it may be necessary to look at other correspondence but that is in relation to a different issue.    For the moment I just want to ask you    But they need your permission if a business plan is to be revised?    Alright.  Then if we can go to the same bundle at page 188 please – FS1, 188.      My apologies.  I would like you please to go to…    Yes Chair.  Mr Zulu is the light good enough for you to read?    Alright.  Well if necessary, we can assist you there.  This is a letter of appointment and it is a letter of appointment of a joint venture by the – addressed by the Head of Department to the joint venture dated 1 October 2014.  I just want to place that on record so that it is a letter that is important in the series of correspondence and documents to assist you Mr Zulu.  And if one goes to the next page that is Bundle FS8 page 189 one will see there a service level agreement.  The first page at least of a service level agreement.      189 Chair.    This is a service level agreement which on the face of it at page 189 was entered into between the Department of Human Settlements represented by Mr Nthimose Mokhesi in his capacity as Head of Department and Blackhead Consulting PTY Ltd Joint Venture and represented by Edwin Sodi in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer the service provider.  That is the agreement which gave rise to the execution eventually of the Asbestos Project.  If you would turn then please to page 231 of the same bundle FS8 one will see another…    No FS8 same bundle page 231.    You have it in front of you?    Thank you.  Mr Zulu would you just look at the email at the foot of the page it appears that it was an email addressed from your office from Thabani Zulu on Wednesday 26 November 2014 to HODHS that is the Head of Department Human Settlements – Free State Human Settlements.gov.za.  And the subject matter is Revised Business Plans for the Department of Human Settlements Free State.  It appears then to be an email addressed by you to Mr Mokhesi.  Do I have it correctly?    Would you like to take a moment to look at it?  It is not very long.    Right.  It says   Yes.    And it would be consistent I presume with the evidence that you have given in some detail Mr Zulu that if there is a need for an amended business plan that has to be approved by the National Department under your authority as Accounting Officer you would have to be properly informed in relation to the reasons or the motivation for the revised business plan.    And it would make sense therefore and this email is consistent with your evidence it appears that your office needs to have full information before it can approve an amended business plan.  Am I correct?    Alright.  Well this – this was answered and we can turn the page to page 232.  This is a long document which is sent to you – in fact I do not want to mislead anybody this is not a long document it is four pages and in the context of this commission that is not long at all.  But if you would go to page 232 please.  This is a document which appears to be addressed to you Mr Zulu as Director General of Department of Human Settlements and it is apparently at least on the face of it at page 235 signed by Mr Mokhesi in his capacity as HOD Human Settlements on the 27 November 2014.  That is the day after the letter that appears at 231 or the email that at page 231.  Is that correct?    And it says in the first paragraph   Right.  You go over the page please and look at the paragraph two thirds down the page or just    It goes on to say   It was told to you in other words a representation was made to you by Mr Mokhesi. “All asbestos will be removed and disposed of as laid out in the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations 85 of 1993.” That is what you were told.    Yes.    Yes, no I understand that.    I understand that that is what…    Is told to you the project involved.    Yes.    Yes of course.    But importantly you are being asked for your approval.    And in – before you give it you quite properly, I might add ask for full information.    As to this project because you are going to take a very important decision to allow this project and amend the budget for it.    Correct.    To amend the allocations within the budget.    Correct.  The – what you are told    Yes he can…    Well let us just as you fairly require some context.  You have said to Mr Mokhesi of the Free State look you are responsible for the costs in this matter.    If you need to amend your business plan to comply with the treasury requirements you must tell me.  That is correct.    You then on the – it is apparent from this email on the 26 November say to him – listen I want your motivation.    Because you asking me to do something, I need to understand your motivation.    He gives you the motivation and, in that motivation,, he tells you Mr Zulu the flat rate of R850.00 per house includes all these issues set out on page 234 and 235 of FS8.  That is what he tells you.    He is making to you a representation and the purpose of that representation and the purpose of this whole document is to convince you to do what you have to do.  Correct?     So why I am putting this to you is you were the recipient of this representation.     And the representation is not too     Mr Zulu, in fairness we will ask him what he meant but for the moment we are interested in what you read.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Zulu you were given an opportunity …[intervenes]     I am sorry?     Leave it there for the moment.     You may want to go back to it.     Yes.      Yes, Chair, we are going to have to deal with both so there will be some toing or froing.     But we share the same challenges, this podium is not the most convenient, nor is yours.     Be that as it may, Chair.     You were given an opportunity by the investigators to deal with this document and so I would just want to refer you …[intervenes]     The document that you have just …[intervenes]     Yes.     And it is a document that was presented to you when you were speaking to the investigators.     Yes, it is the document which appears at page 232, Free State 8 or FS8.  That document that we have just discussed.     No, he does not need it at the moment.     Just to confirm that the document that we have just been talking about authored by Mr Mokhesi  and sent to you and its contents were put to you in a consultation that you had with the investigators.     Yes.     Yes, you are quite correct this was done in written communication.     No, you are absolutely right, my apologies, Mr Zulu.  If you could go to bundle 1, FS1 at page 210.     And perhaps to assist you, Mr Zulu, we should deal first with the paragraph here that talks about the communication that preceded that motivation of Mr Mokhesi to you but before we do so perhaps, we had better identify the whole document.  You recall that next to your second affidavit was a series of questions and answers.  The questions came from the Commission and the answers came from you.     You have that.  That, on the face of it, is a letter dated 14 May 2020 addressed to Mr Thabani Zulu on the letterhead of the Commission.     And you will see, for example, in     And the answers to those questions were inserted by you or by those representing you in italics in blue after each question, correct?     Right.  So that is the context of what I would like to put to you now.  If you could go please to page 210 of the same document – perhaps we should take one step prior to that, page 209, paragraph 2.14.  Do you see that?     The question there relates to a document 7.  Now I can tell you, we do not need to go there, but I can tell you that document 7 is the email that you sent on the 26 November.  Would you like to comment on this document?  Would you like to check that?     209, 2.14, it says document 7, would you like to comment on this document.  Now I am just saying to you, Mr Zulu, to save some time that that document is the document at page 231 of bundle 8 and it becomes apparent in your later answer so you can trust me on that.     And you were asked on that     And then if you go over the page to paragraph 2.15, document 8, would you like to comment on     It is the document that appears in bundle FS8 at 232.  It was also given to you as part of the questions.     Right?  And you were asked    In other words what you are saying to the investigators or the Commission is what you were told by Mr Mokhesi.     As per that document.     Yes, as per document, I am sorry interrupted you.     Then 24, 10.15.2    Thank you, Chair.     No, we can happily take the long adjournment.    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Zulu, just to finish of the first topic that we were dealing with.  If you would look at... under FS1 at page 210.   We are going to return to the answers that you gave in writing to the questions that were put to you by the Commission’s investigators, and if I can take you to paragraph 2.1.5, please, on page 210?    The document being referred to there is the motivation presented to you at your request on the 27t h of November 2014 by Mr Mokhesi.      Yes.  And that is the information that was given to you?    In order to persuade you to make a decision?    Yes.    And then 2.15.2   Yes.  Information provided to you on which you relied?    Yes.  So...[intervenes]     No, I understand.    But on the face of it, what we see before us, is a request by you on the 26t h of November for a particular motivation.   You have received it and you demanded it by the 27t h.  You have received it by the 27t h and that contains certain information which is communicated to you.  That much is clear.      Yes.    Alright.  You required information.  The information was given to you but finally you gave your approval.    You required information.    The information was given to you.  We have been through that information.    You must have taken that information into account in finally giving your approval?    In summary then in relation to the questions that we have been dealing with and your evidence Mr Zulu.  Your intervention or your approval in your capacity as HO... sorry, Director General National Human Settlements was necessary and approval was given.    I would like to move to a different topic if I may Mr Zulu?      And that is, Blackhead’s appointment ...[intervenes]     ...and by Blackhead, I mean Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited.    I am sorry?      You can put that away for the moment.      You can put that away that document.    So I would like to move to a different topic if I may?      Yes.  And we will come to the ...[intervenes]     Yes, sure.  Well, the correspondence that we are going to go through in a minute Mr Zulu is not entirely clear and let me just ask if you can recall.  The appointment of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited in Gauteng, what was that appointment?   Was it an appointment to a panel of service provides?  Was it an appointment arising out of the panel of service providers to do particular work?  Was it an individual appointment of the company?  What was it?    By Gauteng.    Yes, thank you Chair.  In fact, Mr Zulu summarises it quite well himself.  If I can just put to you?    In Free State 1208, you say... if you want to look at it, you are quite welcome to do that.  You say    You go on to say   Thank you.      If we can then move onto another topic and that is the procurement process that preceded the appointment of the joint venture involving Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited.  Would you go please to FS8 page 110?    FS8 Chair.    Page 110.    Please help us clarify Mr Zulu.  The letter that appears on this page appears to be signed by yourself as Director General of the Department of Human Settlements, the National Department. It is dated 7t h of April 2014, it appears.  And it is addressed to Mr Edwin Sodi of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited.  So far we are in agreement I presume?    Would you look at it, please?  Because quite simple, it is not clear from the letter what you    But what your... what you say Mr Zulu, it does appear to be consistent with what appears in the paragraph which follows the title because it says you did,    Thank you.  The contractual arrangements relating to the appointment of this particular panel, and I am talking about the panel and not any instruction to perform work which might have emanated from the appointment to a panel, those would be available, I presume, in the national department.  The records in relation to this, not in the Gauteng department.    Yes.    Yes, they may have access to it but the questions simple is that the records would ordinarily be kept in relation to national arrangements in the national office.    Okay.  If I could you take please to another document in FS1.  Sorry, you are going to have to put that away and refer to FS1.  And if you would go please to page 214.9.      [No audible reply]     Chair, if you would bear with me a moment, please?    Because these documents have been added to the bundle and I am not sure whether they have been filed in your bundle.  So I may just have to just ...[intervenes]     ...look for them elsewhere.  Chair, the copy I have it may be repeated elsewhere in the documentation.  So if you could just give me a moment, please?    Chair, can I... may I ask if you have pages 214.1 to page 214... well, it goes onto 214.19.    This document is the settlement affidavit of Mr Zulu, yet another copy...[intervenes]     ...but it has all the annexures, the documents that were presented to Mr Zulu as part of the questions placed to him by the Commission.    Yes, and they are not very legible I am afraid.  I tried to get more legible copies because they are all in .doc on the background.    Right.  We may be able to help Chair.  We have found another copy of that particular document.    If you would go please Mr Zulu to FS8 page 169.    169 Chair.    Have you got that document Mr Zulu?    That is the same document and you can check it if you wish, as Document 8 given to you in the questions by the Commission to which you answered in that document annexed to your affidavit.  That document appears at... under 1214.14.  It is the same document.  Are you happy to accept that?    Give us a moment, please.    I might have been given the wrong document.  Let us just pause there, please.  In any event, let us deal with the document at 169 of Bundle 8.   And I will just ask the legal team that are behind me to just find the document that was in the bundle given to you. This is a letter addressed to the CEO dated the 19t h of June 2014.  And it says... it is addressed to the CEO of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited.   It is dated the 19 t h of June 2014 and it is addressed to the CEO of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited by Mr Mokhesi who we know is the Head of the Department Human Settlements, Free State at the time.    It is consistent with your evidence.    Well, it goes on to say in paragraph    So we know from your evidence that, according to the correspondence at least, and I am not taking it further than what you have read, according to the correspondence in the documentation at least, Blackhead was appointed nationally as part of a panel.  So far, we are in agreement?    Forgive me.  I have not heard that.    Alright.    Alright.    H’m?    I am happy to do that Mr Zulu and we will go through it at a pace that I have been... we can all understand and it does not impose any pressure on you.    But as I understand your answer.  You say, “Yes, there was a national appointment but that was not the appointment relevant to the procurement process which followed”.    No but had this happen in relation to a later answer Mr Zulu.  When the letter at FS8 110 refers to a bid and a bid being accepted, and we are not talking about a contractual arrangement relevant to what happened later when the contract was transferred or when the Free State participated in the contract.     8.     FS8, 110, the one you sent, you said it referred to a national procurement process.     Yes.     Correct, yes.     And anything that is said in this letter about bids would apply to that national appointment.     No, that is fine, but you did say …[intervenes]     You did say very clearly – sorry, I interrupted you and perhaps I should not have.  Do you want to finish your answer?     Yes, but you did answer further to say that the contract in which Free State participated was a Gauteng contract and not a national contract. MR     Yes, okay, that is fine, we are on the same page so far, perhaps.     So anything that is said in this letter in relation to bids and procurement processes does not apply to the 16A process that we will talk about later.     I am sorry?     The one on page 110 of FS8.     Yes.     Now when you appoint a panel do you go through a competitive bidding process?     So the appointment to the panel referred to in 110 is not the contractual arrangement in which Free State participated, that was another Gauteng appointment.     That would include Gauteng and would include the Free State.     And they are unrelated.     They are unrelated.     Well, before we get to the next letter let me just understand one of the answers you gave previously.  You were aware of the fact that in the Free State that Department of Human Settlements participated in a contract that had been entered into, correct?     You are aware from your last answer, because you have made it very clear in your answer, that the Department of Human Settlements in the Free State participated – you know what that means – in a contract entered into elsewhere.       And as I understood your answer …[intervenes]     Yes.  And as I understood your answer you said that the contract, the participation contract was the Gauteng contract, not the national one.     It had to do with the Gauteng.     So when Mr Mokhesi says in the letter at 8.169, if you would just look at it please?     FS8.       Bundle FS8, page 169.     Page 169.     Paragraph 1.  Well, let us go to the     Yes.      Well, just by way of background, I not sure everybody will follow as far as the public watching my excuse, but Mr Zulu will know that when you extend a contract from let us say for example Gauteng to Free State you need the approval of the service provider as well, is that correct?     So basically, Mr Mokhesi seems to be …[intervenes]     But the point I want to make is in paragraph 1 that Mr Mokhesi is saying to Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd, in seeking that approval that you have referred to, the department - Free State department,  “…wishes to extent your current contract secured by the National Department of Human Settlements in like with Treasury regulations 16(a)(6)(6) of 2005.” Now, as I understand it, quite simply that cannot be consistent with what you have said, Mr Mokhesi must be wrong or you must be wrong.     So all we are doing as the Chair says, Mr Zulu, is asking for – how you understand the words of a particular document and if those words are clear then they are clear.  If they are not clear they are not clear but I do not think that I put anything to you where the words are not clear but if they are not clear you can certainly answer as you feel you should and I am going to come to another letter. But two things arise out of your recent answers, as I understand it.  The first is, the contract that was extended – or, to put it another way more correctly, the contract in which the Free State Human Settlements Department participated originated in Gauteng and not nationally, is that correct?     Yes, okay, so far so good.     Okay, the second …[intervenes]     The second point is that it seems from your answers, which appear to coincide with persons we have consulted in Treasury that you cannot participate in a panel appointment, you have got to participate in a particular contract.  Is that fair?     Yes.  In any event, let us just put aside then the document at 8.169 but summarise the position to say that where state organ B wishes to participate in a contract entered into between a service provider and state organ A, the Regulation 16A requires the consent of both the service provider and the state organ which accepts the contract, am I correct?     But at least two of the affected parties and we can go to the regulation if necessary but what Mr Mokhesi appears to be doing here is precisely that.  He is asking the CEO for his consent.     Yes.  But let us put that aside because the document says what it says and you are not a party to that communication but if you would look please at page 214.9.     Yes.     Bundle 1, FS1, 214.9.  It is one of those unfortunately almost legible documents against the dark background.     You have 214.9?     This is another letter written by Mokhesi to yourself on the same day.  The heading – it is dated the – it appears to have been signed on the 19 June 14 and it is addressed to the Director General Department of Human Settlements, attention Mr P W Zulu,     Alright, we have not got anywhere     Yes, we spoke about it earlier.     With the reference number and it gives a reference number.  The second paragraph is the one I would like you please to comment on if you would. “The Free State Department of Human Settlements hereby request your department to extent…” Should read extend. “…the services of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd in line with Treasury regulation 16A 6.6 of March 05.” Do you see what Mr Mokhesi is asking you?     He is saying please extend the national contract, correct?     I know that that does not accord with your recollection of events firstly, and secondly, you cannot extend a panel appointment.     But you see, Mr Mokhesi  - I am sorry, if I may just explain what the Chair is saying and what we are asking from this side of the room, is the words are clear, the words do not require a context to assist their interpretation and we are simply asking you for your     Simply he is asking you to extend the national contract.     Well, lest there be any doubt, Mr     Then, Mr Zulu, quite frankly it seems from the documentation at least that your observation given to the Chair is entirely correct, you cannot ask national department to extend mere appointment to a panel because there are no terms and conditions of contract to do work.     That is correct. Let us then go on please to the same bundle, FS8, at page 181.       FS8, 181.     Yes, Chair.     FS8, 181.     So that is a letter addressed to Mr Mokhesi, Department of Human Settlements dated 13 August 2014, apparently signed by yourself, and you say under the heading appointment, same heading coincidentally, the appointment of a professional resource team to a departmental panel and municipal planning and implementation support to the Human Settlements Departments and Municipalities with specific [interference on audio] refers. “Please be informed that in terms of Treasury Regulation 16[a] 6.6 it is allowed for the Free State Department of Human Settlements to participate in the contract arranged by the process from the database of the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements for Professional Resource Teams Consulting Pty Limited was appointed from.” Do you have any comment?     So, do I understand it correctly, Mr Zulu, you would have made enquiries, you would have responded to some form of communication, but here, quite differently to the correspondence that preceded it, as far as you’re concerned, you clarified that this was a Gauteng appointment that was being dealt with, correct?     Well in fairness, and as you’ve said, they can come and explain why they were seeking to extend the provisions of a National panel appointment and not what you’ve pointed out here, a Gauteng one.  They may have changed their minds, there may have been other communications, they can explain but I’d like to ask you, from your knowledge then, what Gauteng was being extended?     Yes, what was being participated in, and I want, just to explain for those who might find it difficult to follow us.  A contract is entered into with State organ A.     Gauteng Province, correct?     The law allows another organ of State, Free State Department to participate in that contract, quite what that means we can talk about in due course if we have time or we will make submissions to the Chair in that regard.     But to put it in another way, loosely and incorrectly as it turns out, you transfer the provisions of one contract from – with one State organ to another contract or the same contact to another State organ, do I have it, more or less correct?     Understood Mr Zulu, thank you for that explanation.  The point I want to make, however, is what I’d like you to clarify for us, is something different but before we get there, let’s just confirm that one of the reasons you couldn’t extend the National Contract is because it was merely appointment to a panel with no terms and conditions for work attached?     Correct.     And of course, if you want to extend or participate in a contract, it’s obvious that contract must say what work must be done, what price, how it must be done by when, that sort of thing, correct?     But let’s get back to this letter at 181 please. Do you know – you signed this letter, do you know what contract, which is a subject matter of a participation process in terms of Treasury Regulations 16(A) 66 has been referred to, you know what they’re talking about here?     1-8-1 your letter.     Yes, something is going to move…[intervenes].     Alright, let me put it again please, as fairly as I can.  There is an arrangement or contract in the Gauteng Department, correct?     Free State want to participate in it and that’s the purpose of all this correspondence we’re dealing with, correct?     What is it that exists in Gauteng in which the Free State wants to participate, what is it?  In other words, look at your language, Mr Zulu, if you will, “Please be informed in terms of Treasury Regulation 16(A) 66 it is allowed for the Free State Department of Human Settlements to participate in the contract, What contract?     But you could help us, to a certain extent as a matter of general principle, Mr Zulu, as I understand your evidence you can’t extend membership of a panel or an arrangement to be a member of a panel because there are no contractual terms and conditions, you can only extend a particular contract between a service provider and the department which includes duties and price and the rest.     Correct, well at least we know what can be participated and made subject to 16(A)66 and what can’t, thank you for that.  We can move on…[intervenes].     Well in fairness, Mr Zulu, we are asking you to interpret your words.     Bear with me a moment Chair.  If you would go, please, to page 88 of FS8.  This is a memorandum addressed to the acting Head of Department, Ms Margaret-Ann Diedericks dated 13 March 2014 by the Directorate Special Projects in Gauteng Province, Human Settlements Department.  It’s a memorandum that results in the appointment of eight PRT’s, Professional Resource Teams for assessment of asbestos identification and removal.  Now we will ask the relevant people about this document but if I can just ask you, to assume for the moment that this is the source document, as it appears to be, for the appointment of eight PRT’s in Gauteng and take you please to page 90 of this memorandum.  It’s headed, Asbestos Roof Eradication, terms of reference and implementation plan, it says, in the second last paragraph, on page 90, “The assessment phase is envisaged to be carried out in March and April 2014. The expiration of the PRT’s contracts at the end of March should not have an effect on the assessment and is to be viewed as work in progress”.  This seems to be an indication that, whatever PRT contracts existed in Gauteng were to expire at the end of March but I presume you wouldn’t have any knowledge of that?     But if – let us just go then to the next page, page 91 of FS8, the third last paragraph reads, “Professional rates for assessment will be applied in line with the Departments IPW fee structure at R650 per house.  This will be a fixed rate and the Department will not accept any deviations from this”.  Right, and then the recommendations, over the page are that the memo should be taken account of, 2) that the attached terms of reference should be proved and the appointment of eight PRT’s for the assessment of asbestos in Gauteng should be approved.  If these recommendations and the terms of reference which resulted, and I’ll go to them in a moment, constituted the basis of the Gauteng appointment of the service providers for asbestos removal, including the appointment of Blackhead, then those terms and conditions would be reflected in the contractual arrangement with the service provider, is that a fair assumption to make?     Yes, it does seem obvious, thank you but if one needs any further confirmation, the terms of reference for the eradication of asbestos roofs on houses in Gauteng appears at page 94, a few pages on.     Page 94, FS8.     And if you go through please to the scope of works.  Now, you very fairly said, Mr Zulu, that you can’t extend or participate in something that has no substance, you’ve got to have terms and conditions.  We see here, terms and conditions, under scope of works, 5.1,     Are you at page 98 of FS8?     5.1 are you there?      It goes on an deals with an implementation planning stage at 5.2, it seems there are three phases here, 1) an assessment phase, 2) implementation planning phase, which involves priorities and phasing and appointment of competent persons for detailed designs and builds a quantity compilation, I don’t want to get too complex here, this is really just what is set out in this document, as being what is required as the scope of works and then 5.3 is the construction phase.  So, to the extent that the terms and conditions in these documents, Mr Zulu, were the terms and conditions which bound the Gauteng service providers.  If this contract was to be participated in, in the Free State it would be bound by the same terms and conditions.  If you’re going to extend a contract it must be the same contract, correct?     Right.     Well, Chair, there is a witness who, perhaps should be excused, the question is whether the – Mr Manyeke of Ori, the second sub-contractor should give evidence tomorrow or Mr Sodi who’s been summoned for tomorrow.  From the legal team’s point of view, we would prefer Mr Sodi to give evidence because is evidence is more substantial for this project.  Chair, it may be, that we can cut the questions to Mr Manyeke to the minimum but then I’d need time to pay attention to that task.  So, if possible, I wouldn’t like to sit too late tonight, I’ll try get through as much as possible before 4 o’clock.     Yes, I was to participate in that zoom conference Chair for a short time at least.    With your leave.      Well, if that’s the case I’m very happy Chair, we can cancel the other one or postpone it at least.    Perhaps I will address you about that separately.    Yes.  Chair it is not…    There is not much time that is necessary now in relation to Mr Zulu.  Mr Zulu has expressed the – the desire to complete today so if we may complete today, I do not think we will go much beyond four.    And then what we can do is call Mr Manyike early tomorrow he will be very brief.    And then complete Mr Sodi.    Yes thank you Chair.    Yes Chair.  I – I will be available for a short time.    By your leave Chair.    Okay.    Thank you.  Mr Zulu then the question now involves certain benefits received by you and let us not debate for the moment whether they were legitimate or not.  We can come to that at a later stage.  Let us simply try and establish the facts.  Because I think the facts are largely common cause including your explanation for what occurred.  Chair the references here the evidence has been summarised.  And if I may refer you to Bundle FS8 at page 39 and following.  What the investigators have done is they have examined the bank accounts of Mr Sodi and arising out of Mr Sodi’s bank accounts they have traced certain payments which involve a motor dealer and I must apologise to the owner of the institution it is in Ballito not Pietermaritzburg.  So there can be no passing off as a result of the re-advertisements in this session.  The evidence involves two transactions.  One involving the payment of R1 million and the other involving the payment of R600 000.00.  But if we may go to FS8 39 please.      FS8 page 39.      Yes please.      The product of the investigations Mr Zulu for the present appears at page 39 at paragraph 9.3.1.  And what the investigators have established is that the amount of R1 million was transferred on the 26 May 2015 from Blackhead and the ABSA account number is given to SMD Trading Group and the ABSA account number is given.  SMD Trading Group is a car dealership in Ballito.  As I understand it there is no dispute from you in that regard.  You do not have any information to contradict those things.    Let me go through it again.  R1 million was transferred on 26 May 2015 from Blackhead to SMD Trading Group a car dealership in Ballito.    Yes.  No I understand but I need to put it to you anyway.    Well it is not that you do not agree with it it is just that you have no comment in relation to it.    Yes the R600 000.00 we will come to.  What is interesting about it though in Sodi’s records the transaction was marked TZ.  He explains it later but he marks it TZ.  And perhaps I better put the full sequence to you to make it easier.  In SMD records the transaction is referred to as Thabani Zulu right.  But according to Mr Duminy he says that although Thabani Zulu is referenced in the bank statement this payment went toward the sale of a Maserati to Mr Mabheleni Ntuli and he has not been interviewed by the investigators.  So it seems to me that Sodi makes a payment of R1 million to SMD.  In his records he marks it TZ.  In the recipient’s records SMD records he references Thabani Zulu.  But that payment is used to buy a Maserati for Mr Ntuli.  Now do you know of those facts?  Is there anything in those facts that you can contest?    What is interesting however is Mr Sodi’s explanation for this which we will ask him about.  He says oh he just associated you with Mr Ntuli and that is why he put the TZ reference.  Have you any comment to make in regard to that?  Is there any reason why Mr Sodi would associate you with Mr Ntuli to put the incorrect reference in his payment according to him?    Mabheleni.    Mabheleni.      Oh I see.    And do you know the spelling of the first name?    Well let us call him Mr Ntuli I think that [loud laughter].    In any event Mr Ntuli you say your introduced him to Mr Sodi?    That could be the explanation.    And Mr Sodi says well he just knew you were associated so therefore he put his head on the pavement – payment reference.  But let us leave that aside for the moment.  Mr Ntuli is a businessman in KwaZulu Natal if I am not mistaken.    And Mr Sodi expressed the desire to get involved…    And Mr Sodi apparently expressed the desire to extend his businesses into KwaZulu Natal?    You would not know that.    In any event that sequence of events that I have just described to you is admitted by Mr Sodi in paragraph 65.6 of his new affidavit dated the 26 May 2015.  He says he used TZ because he associated TZ with Mr Ntuli.  It appears that on the recipient side SMD knew who TZ was because they recorded it as Thabani Zulu.  You cannot comment on that?      That would be a question for…    And in fairness to Mr Zulu that is as far as the investigators can take it.    It seems that in respect of the payment of R 600 000,00, apart from one aspect that may arise later, there is also not much in dispute, that on the 22n d of December 2015, an amount of R 600 000,00 was paid to SMD?    That was paid by Mr Sodi under the reference SMD.    Alright.    So according to the documentation... you can go through it if you wish.    According to the documentation, SMD received this amount of R 600 000,00 and placed the reference TZ next to that receipt.  That is what... or was SMD’s reference TZ.    And you do not take issue of that, I presume, because of what follows.    Yes, okay.      Yes.  And then Mr Zulu, according to Mr Duminy that amount of R 600 000,00 went towards the purchase of a Range Rover for yourself.    And that is correct?    Right.      What is curious Mr Zulu is that on the 23rd of March 2016, that is some three months later, SMD sent an invoice to you for R 690 000,00 reflecting a cash deposit of R 690 000,00.  Do you know anything about that?    And who paid that?    No.  The SMD invoice to Mr Zulu for R 690 000,00 also reflected a cash deposit of R 690 000,00.  Who paid that cash deposit?    Alright.  So what is common cause, leaving aside the various references and the initials, is that R 600 000,00 was paid to SMD on the 22n d of December 2015 could have been subject to your explanations.    Alright.  But maybe ...[intervenes]     Well, even on your own version, one can debate whether discharge of a debt arising out monies from whether it arises a benefit or not.    But I am not going to have that argument with you.  That is a legal argument.  But for the present, I do need to put to you your explanation for that transaction. You say, “Yes, Sodi made such payment to SMD on my instructions in discharge of a debt due by him to one of my business, TZ Lounge...” Correct?     “...for goods sold and delivered and services rendered during 2015...”    First question, if I may Mr Zulu.  Is there any documentation by way of a letter, an invoice, a record of expenditure that substantiates that statement.    Yes, I was going to... if I may just take it step-by-step?    Let us start Mr Zulu with your    A verbal instruction?    What did you do?  Did you telephone Mr Sodi and say, “Pay me what you owe me”.    So a customer would come and poor the liquor or participate in an event or the food.  Is that correct?    How would payment be made?    I am sorry.  I did not hear that.    Oh, you had a card machine.    Alright.  So you would pay... a customer would pay cash or swipe the card?    Would it be normal for you to allow someone to run up a tap?  I think it is the word.  Or run up a debt of R 600 000,00?    Alright.  Sorry.      It can be something that is used in different parts. [laughs]    But Mr Sodi appears, on your version, that you run up a debt to your lounge of R 600 000,00.    Over here... ja.     Chair, if I may interrupt?     I have just got a message that the stenographers are struggling to hear Mr Zulu.     Thank you, Chair.  If I understand your evidence, Mr Zulu, during 2015 Mr Sodi became indicated to your business, that business is T Z Lounge, correct?     Please, I was just going to interrupt your voice.   The indebtedness of R600 000, did he come into your premises occasionally?     And was it the debt that – or the expenses that he would have incurred on that occasion, did that form part of the R600 000?     And you say there were times when you delivered alcohol as well?     This was during 2015?     And you say that when customers come, they can use a credit card?     Or – and the credit card would be that payment by credit card?     They would not have to draw money elsewhere; they would just swipe the credit card on your credit card machine?     So there is a credit card facility and there was a credit card facility in 2015?     Now this money is owed to your business?     Is there any reason why you would have said to Sodi pay it for my personal benefit and not pay it to the business?     You see, what you did was you did not say to Sodi pay it to my business.     You said pay it to the garage dealer for my personal benefit.     Is that correct?     Well, our investigations show that there is an entity with the letters T Z that is owned by someone else in Pietermaritzburg.  Do you know of that entity?     Do you say – are you the sole owner of T Z Lounge?     Well, then you cannot be the sole owner.  Are you and your wife joint owners of T Z Lounge?     And the business is registered in the names of both you and our wife?        And by what name is your wife registered in that business?      Surname?     Spell that please?     Brooding?     I am just asking who owned the business, there is nothing sinister in that question.     Because what happens is that a debt owed to the business is paid to you in your personal capacity but that may be something that can be debated. MR     At a later stage.     Well, I do have a note from the investigators here that …[intervenes]     Yes, I am just saying do you know of any other entity with the letters T Z that is a similar business to yours?     You do not know, alright, well I would imagine you would know of your competitors in Pietermaritzburg, particularly competitors with the name of T Z.     But you have no competitors who trade under the initials T Z?     And you would know, obviously, if there was another T Z Lounge in Pietermaritzburg not owned by you, but be that as it may, I have a question here as to did you offer the documentation that you now talk about when you were asked to give evidence as to the payment of R600 000?  You could have said look, I have got documentation.     Did you offer documentation?     One of the other features of the way this money was paid to you is that nothing would appear in your bank accounts.     The proposition that I would want to put to you, Mr Zulu, is not a difficult proposition.  The transaction involving the payment of R600 000 for your benefit or in discharge of a debt to SMD Motors would not appear in your personal bank accounts, correct?     And that would enable Mr Sodi too to say, as he does, FS1 page 519, paragraph 81, it is a straightforward statement, it says …[intervenes]     Page 519 of FS1, paragraph 81.     Page 519.     Yes.     yes.     Do you have it there, Mr Zulu?     Do you have it, Chair?     Paragraph 81 he says    Because he says he has not made …[intervenes]     Well, insofar as you are a government official, he is correct, he has not made any payment into your personal account, correct?     But he has made a payment of R600 000 to you through a payment to SMD Motors.  He has discharged the debt to you and paid that to SMD Motors.  The point I am making …[intervenes]     …is the construction of the transaction to SMD Motors ensures that it does not appear     And there is no but after.  But anyway, let me just go, if I may, by way of summary to your own statements.  Your first affidavit appears in bundle FS1 at page 152.     If you would bear with me a moment, Chair, if I could just get it?  Your affidavit appears – your first affidavit, EXHIBIT TT5.1 appears in bundle FS1 at 150.  I do not want - to take you, if I may, briefly to page 152.     You say at paragraph 7.2 in the     We know that you knew and you do know that you did receive money subject to an explanation in relation to the legitimacy of the payment, correct?     Let me make it clear, and this is why your issue with Mr Dukwana isn’t directly relevant to today’s proceedings, Mr Zulu, is that we are not putting to you that you are the recipient of R10million from the asbestos project, it’s not being put.  What is being put to you is something entirely different.  I’d like to make one more point which is a point…[intervenes].     Mr Zulu you are here because of the investigations that have been done by the Commission which have been put to you today, that is why you are here.  You are not here to answer to an allegation made by Mr Dukwana.     The further point that I want to put to you, is had you given all your bank accounts, your bank accounts and those of the – your wife to the investigators they would not have picked up this payment to SMD.     In paragraph 8 of your statement or your first affidavit at page 154 of FS1 you say, “I would have expected the Commission to have investigated my bank accounts by virtue of the subpoena powers or summons powers that they have at their disposal.  Had they done that, they wouldn’t have picked up the payment to SMD Motors”,  Correct?     So, what, by summary we have established then is that you played some role as an official in the establishment of the asbestos scheme, whether…[intervenes].     You played some role in your official capacity in the establishment of the scheme…[intervenes].     Accounting role yes.     Official role, in your official capacity, let’s stress that, I’m happy to stress that.     In the – what became, ultimately, the asbestos scheme.  You did receive money from Mr Sodi, you’ve explained it as to why you’ve received it, correct?     The initials TZ appear frequently in these transactions, correct?     Don’t worry we’ll deal with that in due course with other witnesses you certainly haven’t shied away, at least in these proceedings from your initials Mr Zulu.  We don’t have further questions.     Well I’ve just been passed a note, which perhaps contains a question I should ask but I think it’s clear already but before we go there, any further information that you had in relation to the R600 000, you could have volunteered, correct, you could have, had you wanted to.     We’ll be very quick, if you would just hear the question, maybe I could put it again, to be clear.     Yes, alright what is…[intervenes].     What is interesting is that, it was only after the investigators had discovered these transactions with SMD Motors that all this came out. It could have come out before as the Chair points out.     It’s not in the public domain not is it in your bank accounts, nor is it in your record.     Thank you Chair.     Sorry Chair, I did receive a note and it’s not worth my while to ignore it, from the team.  When did your relationship and friendship with Mr Sodi begin, what year can you remember?     Was it before 2014?     Chair it would be best if we began tomorrow if we may, we will attempt to finish two witnesses tomorrow.     I don’t envisage – well who can say, I don’t envisage any interlocutory rule.     No, no Chair. 
ADV DAYAL SC:  Thank you Mr Commissioner.    Yes. Mr Commissioner my name is Shane Dayal I am counsel from Durban and Johannesburg.    I am instructed in this matter by Mr Manoj Maharaj of Attorneys Maharaj Attorneys.  I represent two witnesses today.  The first Mr Duminy you have heard from my learned friend about Mr Duminy’s evidence and I represent a witness who I do not wish to obviously disclose for reasons that will become clear as I address.    Mr Commissioner.      Mr Commissioner just by way of a brief background you will recall that during the course of last year in August I together with my learned friend Mr Hellens SC appeared for a witness.  He was given a Section 3.3 Notice by the commission in respect of certain evidence that allegedly implicated him that was to be given by a Mr Dukwana. Now Mr Dukwana you will recall Mr Commissioner has already given evidence during the course of last year and a I understand from my learned friend Mr Pretorius his address to commission yesterday which I watched that all of the evidence that is going to be led during the course of this week relates to what is termed the Asbestos Project in the Free State. The very basis of that evidence that the commission has at this stage is as a consequence of Mr Dukwana’s evidence.   Now during the course of last year when I did appear, we put before the commission an affidavit from my client.  We raised in that affidavit certain issues we have with Mr Dukwana leading evidence on a certain aspect. It was a spread sheet if you recall I will not go into any further detail but I think you do recall and you have seen – you have seen the affidavit in any event.    And we raised the issue about – we raised two issues.    I am sorry.    I apologise.    I am sorry.    Yes you will recall that we – we raised two issues in the affidavit.  We said firstly that before our client is called in a very public forum such as this one on TV and before his reputation in any way is tarnished or dragged through the mud so to speak, we would like two things.  One is we would like the commission to properly investigate the allegations in Mr Dukwana’s affidavit and we would also like the commission to consider that we would like to cross-examine Mr Dukwana. Now we specifically in our affidavit if you recall tendered full cooperation to the commission.  We tendered our documents, bank statements whatever the commission required.  But we specifically said in the affidavit that before we are called into a very public forum these – given the importance of the commission and its responsibilities to investigate these allegations and to please give us an opportunity to cross-examine Mr Dukwana. Anyway, that affidavit and you will recall that affidavit was – was given the commission during August last year.  Mr Hellens and I then appeared I think it was the 27 August there is a transcript in respect of that where various things were raised and Mr Commissioner then after considering all of the issues raised then decided that it is prudent for the commission to properly investigate and thereafter to make a determination on calling Mr – calling the witness. What happened then was two things.  Firstly, in regard to the investigations we cooperated.  In regard to the issue of the cross-examination that was on the commission’s own letter held in abeyance and at this stage if I may just make reference to the further affidavit delivered by client which I think is before Mr Commissioner.    It is probably not but I am – I am… am…    But I am specifically referring to its annexure TW2 – TWZ2.1.      Can I – for the sake of convenience.    I can just ask my attorney to give me a copy of the letter.    And I can then – I can then hand up my copy of my letter please.    Thank you.    Sorry Mr Commissioner can I just …    Thank you Mr Commissioner I apologise for that.    Yes if one looks at this letter this is a letter addressed by the commission itself.  It is by the secretary of the commission Mr Tshabalala and it makes reference to the initial statement that my – the initial affidavit that my client put up last year.    And it confirms receipt too of the affidavit.  It notes what is stated in paragraph 7.2 and 11 that is the unequivocal tender by my client to cooperate with the commission’s investigations.  To make any documents available including bank statements.  To make himself available for an interview.  To make himself available to answer any questions.    And then it say   That is the…    Reference to the application to cross-examine Mr Dukwana.    Now …    Just on that issue if I may?    You will recall that it was not my learned friend Mr Pretorius.    That was leading the evidence last year.    It was Advocate Mokoena.    Mokoena.    That was leading the evidence.    So it could very well – I am speculating but it could very well be…    I see.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Indeed.  And that was in December last year.    And then you will recall we have put in as I have said two affidavits but what happened then after December is eventually a Mr Lambrechts – Etienne Lambrechts from the commission came back and communicated directly with my client and so on and subpoenaed documents from the bank and when we in fact had already said that we cooperating there is no need to do that.  But be that as it may I just want raise the issue of not just the conduct of some of the representatives of the commission and I – and I say that will all humility and respect but with an equal amount of strength that my client has been treated rather shabbily and unfairly. For one when he made this tender as far back as August last year.    The tender was not in fact taken up.  In fact, what happened then was there were subpoenas issued for bank statements and so on. There was a threat that he must be – he is going to be summonsed before the commission.    There was a stage where there was direct communication with the client instead of my instructing attorney know full well that my attorney is on record.    There was somewhat of harassment as to my client being forced to disclose his whereabouts for certain things to be served on him.  This is all dealt with in the further affidavit.  I need not.    Yes, I think you have seen it.    But the point of my address is simply this at this stage.  Other than the manner in which my client was treated it appears that there is a procedural…    Yes I appreciate that Mr Commissioner.    That aside there would also need to be a response in respect of our application to cross-examine.    And at this stage may I just refer firstly to the affidavit of my client – the first affidavit in August last year and I think you have that before you.    It is the first affidavit.    That is right and…    Indeed, and that affidavit is in fact attached to the further affidavit as well as a matter of convenience.    Thank you.      Mr Commissioner if you – firstly you would look at paragraph 7 and obviously our page numbers are different so I apologise I cannot tell you which page but it is paragraph 7.    That is the one.    Yes.    So just bearing in mind the background that Mr Dukwana is if I may term it the commission’s star witness on the asbestos eradication project.    In the Free State.    So bearing that in mind this is what my client.  He said, firstly he wants to make a few things – he    Yes.    And – well no.    Mr Commissioner can I…    Yes.  But can I …    Can I – can I – can I make two points on that score?  You have a discretion and I read – I have read your rulings.    You have a discretion, the test is well set out in your rulings.  There is no right to cross-examine.    But my point is our application has not even yet been considered.    Well…    Yes.    That may very well be and I take your point.  But just bear in mind that as far as the commission is concerned they recognised this an application to cross- examine because they said to us in December – well when I say they I apologise I mean the letter – the letter said to us in December written on behalf of the commission that your application will be held in abeyance.  And it seems that they recognised two things.  They recognised our tender to cooperate which is clearly set out in the letter and they recognised our application to cross-examine and they said, it will be held in abeyance.  But even if – even if we have to bring a fresh application and Mr Commissioner is of the view that this is not suffice as an application my point is that that still has to be decided.  As far as we were aware the commission recognised it as an application to cross-examine.    We now learnt for the first time today and in fact this morning that it is not recognised as an application to cross-examine but that – I am not making much of that at this stage.  It is something that we have to deal with.    But it – more importantly it is something that the commission procedurally has to deal with because if indeed we are given a right – are given leave by Mr Commissioner to cross-examine then firstly our application itself would have to be determined.  Mr Commissioner would have to apply your mind to that application and then it is yes or no depending on how Mr Commissioner views it.  And thereafter we either cross-examine or we do not.  But at this stage it is premature to even go into the application when on the commission’s version that application in any event is in abeyance.    And obviously has not been decided as yet.  So we say with all due respect that is yet a further prejudicial aspect to my client.  That causes serious prejudice with respect because now we have a situation where initially the commission says to us last year, here is a Section 3.3 Notice in respect of Mr Dukwana’s evidence.  We come along and we say to the commission, we have difficulties with Mr Dukwana’s evidence for the reasons set out in our affidavit we would like to cross-examine him.    Mr Commissioner yes.    Simply put I am saying that procedurally we have a right to certain things including having our application to cross-examine before our client or my client is put into the witness box and is asked questions surrounding this asbestos project in the Free State and we say that the very evidence or basis that the commission is now proceeding this week to ask these questions and this much is clear from Mr Pretorius’ address yesterday is Mr Dukwana’s evidence on what the commission heard last year on the asbestos audit.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja the essence of my submissions yes.    Mr Commissioner I think there are two aspects to that.  Before he even gets to the point of the cross-examination, he would like his application decided.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well he – yes.  I think I would like to make just one point to add to that if I may.    Remember he came last year – my client came along last year to the commission and said, these are the issues I have with Mr Dukwana’s evidence please can I cross-examine him.      The commission then said to us in December we recognise implicitly in that letter.    We recognise your application to cross-examine but it is in abeyance.  So he procedurally with respect his application for cross-examine – to cross-examine has – is still in abeyance in respect of a witness that I am given to understand has already given evidence at length.    About the asbestos project.    So the point is that he would like his application – he would like Mr Commissioner to apply your mind to the application first before he is compelled into the witness box in a very public forum to be questioned about issues surrounding the asbestos project.    Well he could not raise any other concern at that stage.    Because Mr Dukwana had not yet given evidence.    Mr Dukwana had given an affidavit and as is the customary practice with the commission.    Mr Commissioner then sends a Section 3.3.    Notice to say you are possibly implicated.    This is the evidence that you are implicated in or allegedly implicated in you now have rights.  You can seek to cross-examine.  You can come and give evidence or you can send someone on your behalf to give evidence.    So we had not at that stage heard any of Mr Dukwana’s evidence.    Then Mr Dukwana after we came along on the 27 August and Mr Commissioner found that that aspect should not be dealt with at all and so on and we left the commission at that stage.  Mr Dukwana then gave evidence at length.    As I am given to understand of the transcripts about the Free State Asbestos Audit.    So just bearing in mind at that stage that is what we were asked to deal with.  It could very well be a case at the stage when we either have to bring a fresh application call it to cross-examine or supplement our application to cross-examine.  It may be other aspects that we require to be – to cross-examine or not.    Mr Commissioner if I may.  Can I just ask you before I answer that question because the answer to that question is no that is not my only concern.    But I think I need to tell you why and if you look for example at the further affidavit of Mr – of my client and that appears – I am sorry I do not have the page number but it is the further affidavit.    But attached to that affidavit appears the – to – appears the questions that were put to my client.    By the commission’s investigators.    And that is annexure TWZ8.    Sorry Mr Commissioner?    It is not just – no it is not – it is not just the car.    If for example if one looks at this document – can I perhaps just point you to.    So the document is dated the 14 May 2020 it is from the commission.  This time it is signed by – oh sorry it is not signed by anyone but I think it is clearly a document from the commission because it was a letter saying these are the questions, we would like you to answer and then we answered the questions.  But the questions revolved around some of - some of the questions revolved    It asked questions about whether that is a document signed by him.  It then asked questions about Mr Dukwana’s spelling of his name and so on.  It then asked questions about the spread sheet in paragraph 2.4 that Mr Dukwana made reference to in his affidavit.  And it then asked various other questions about companies and parties such as Blackhead and – and so on which are issues that we all – we have addressed completely in the letter.  But the point I am trying to make is that the questions that were asked revolved around Mr Dukwana’s evidence.    Those are the questions that were asked by the commission and those were the answers we gave.    And that is what the commission wants us to deal with today by getting into the witness box to deal with.  And I see it as... it is all due ...[intervenes]     Can I perhaps correct that impression, if I may?    The answer to those questions, because of the conduct of the Commission’s investigators ...[intervenes]     ...and I can take you through the affidavit but he answered those questions ...[intervenes]     ...under pain of the possibility of subpoenas and being summonsed to the Commission and been asked about his whereabouts.    And he answered those... I am sorry to interrupt you but... and he answered those questions consistent with his tender that he originally made last year to say, “Please, interview me.  Ask me these questions.  Do not subpoena my bank accounts.  Do not embarrass me”.    “I am cooperating”.    Sorry, can I just address you very briefly on that?    When... firstly, I think it must be borne in mind that this is a very public forum Mr Commissioner.  As we stand here, we are being televised ...[intervenes]     ...the country, around the country.    When one has to get into a witness box on... in this kind of forum, which is public as this is, one obviously has certain rights which need to be protected.   Now if Mr Commissioner is of the view that you can carry on with the evidence and there really is no prejudice at the end of the day, I ask Mr Commissioner just to bear this in mind. The prejudice is extreme because if my client was cooperative with the Commission at all material times and he has answered their questions, both by way of written answers and in terms of two affidavits now, and he is then, for the sake of it just called into the witness box to be publicised ...[intervenes]     Well, that is my point.      Is that really what it is coming down to?    Well, I say this to you with all due respect, then just bear in mind that it is a public forum.    And there is a responsibility that the Commission has in, not only finding a balance between what must be done correctly in terms of the Constitution’s purposes, but in respect of witnesses’ integrity and reputation.    That is the first thing.    The second thing is.  I am not asking Mr Commissioner to stop this Commission dead in its tracks while I go ahead and bring my application to cross-examine.   There are other witnesses who will be given evidence over the next few days as I understand.  The Commission can carry on with its work.   But the point I am trying to make is this.  When Mr    I am sorry, Mr Commissioner.  Can I just...    Just to make sure that there is nothing further.    Right.  Mr Commissioner ...[intervenes]     I just... my instructing attorney just reminds me to raise this point.  And that is, when Mr Commissioner says that my client can give evidence before Mr Dukwana is cross-examined and then can decide later whether he wants to cross-examine him and so on.   Just bear in mind that what then Mr Commissioner is then permitting, is for Mr Dukwana’s untested evidence to stand and for my client to then give evidence.   And then at some later stage to be given, firstly, an application... firstly, an opportunity to have his application decided to cross-examine and test that witness and then possible test that witness under cross-examination which is a bit like putting the cart before the horse, so to speak. Because as much as you say, “Well, my client can come and give evidence”.  And then decide at a later stage whether to cross-examine Mr Dukwana or not, it works the other way as well and that my client may want to cross-examine Mr Dukwana first and then decide. Indeed, the Commission may then decide say, “Well, there is no need to call my client”.    Because, in fact, there is no evidence that he needs to deal with.    Yes.    Indeed.  But that is speculation because at the end of the day, until ...[intervenes]     Yes, I ...[intervenes]     Yes.    Yes.    Indeed.  Yes.     Yes.    Yes.    Mr Commissioner, I take your point and it can happen but my point is, it is not just that.  My point was his application to cross-examine has not even yet been decided and that is where I find, with respect, the procedural ...[intervenes]     ...irregularity because it is if... it... and I think I have conceded that you do not have to give him the leave to cross-examine.  There is a discretion.  There is a test and you exercise the discretion judicially.   But even before you have exercised that discretion and applied your mind, that application has to be decided which is presently being held in advance on the Commission’s own version and it has not yet been decided.    So it could be a case that you give us leave to cross-examine or not but you even decided that yet, with respect.  And that I think is point made.    Yes.    Yes.  Mister ...[intervenes]     Mr Commissioner, I must tell you this.    If I knew... if I had known that the Commission’s approach was that there is no application, I would, obviously, brought an application.    Thank you.    So from what I gather from my learned friend’s address to Mr Commissioner, he is going to be leading then evidence only in relation to what is stated by Mr Duminy, as I understand it, in his affidavit.  And I say that because Mr …[intervenes]      Mr Commissioner, as I understood him, he said that he is going to be asking my client questions relating to certain payments that were made to a motor car dealership in Pietermaritzburg.      Yes.    Yes, the point I am just trying to understand here is if there is not going to be any questions at all about Mr Dukwana then the questions that my learned friend wish to put, firstly I just remind the Commission that my client received another Section 3.3 notice in respect of allegations made by Mr Duminy and he received a separate Section 3.3 notice in respect of certain allegations made by Mr Mogese.   In his affidavit before the Commission he says I take no issue with those affidavits, I have received the Section 3.3 notice, those allegations made in those do not implicate.  So he does not want to give any evidence, he does not need to give any evidence on that.  That evidence is already there.    Yes.    The point I am just trying to make is that this is the Commission’s procedure, we were given 3.3 notices to say we are possibly implicated persons in respect of allegations made in two affidavits and we said in our – in his affidavit he says I do not have a problem, nothing in those affidavits implicate me, so I just want to draw that to your attention.    So whether or not there is evidence that is actually required by my client is a question that obviously the Commission needs to determine because if there is not going to be any questions revolving around the evidence of Mr Dukwana then what we are left with really is the evidence of Mogese and Duminy and my client has already said he takes no issue with that.  That is my first point. My second point is my learned friend says that well there was an agreement for my client to appear here today.  Well, that is not entirely correct.  As much as there was an agreement to appear, that agreement has a background.  The background is that my client was being threatened with a summons to appear today, irrespective of what has happened before and what we have said in the affidavits before.   So hands tied, so to speak, here he is because otherwise he would have been summoned.  He does not want to disrespect the Commission and he certainly does not want to run foul of the law so he is here.  That is the point, it is not simply a case of well, we are here because we are happy and we agree to it.    Mr Commissioner, firstly on the issue of the summons, it is dealt with in the further affidavit from paragraph 31 onwards.    Where on the 21 July Mr Lambrechts said that he has been instructed to prepare a summons for my client.    Now this after – there has also been correspondence between the attorney, there is an Advocate Renate at the Commission, my attorney corresponded with her with Lambrechts to say we are willing to cooperate at all material times, we have been willing to cooperate.  Despite that, there was then the email from Lambrechts saying he is now instructed to prepare a summons for my client.    Yes.    Mr Commissioner …[intervenes]    Yes.    I appreciate fully the issue of the summons; I am just putting in context this agreement that it was as a result of this threat of the issue of the summons.    And I fully appreciate the importance of the work of the Commission.    And the necessity to summons witnesses but in this context when my learned friend says well, we agreed to be here today, we agreed to be here today because despite us cooperating and saying we will be here today there was a threat of a summons.    That is the only point there.    Mr Commissioner, on this issue of it is based only the application for the adjournment to deal with the issue of cross-examination is based only on the evidence of Dukwana, I just have this to remind Mr Commissioner about.  As I understand my learned friend’s address from yesterday, all the evidence that the Commission is dealing with this week or from yesterday or today, tomorrow or whatever the case is, including the evidence of my client, is evidence in respect of the asbestos audit in the Free State.  It is not evidence about anything else, it is not evidence about general aspects of the issues, it is related specifically to that audit. Now if one, without me going into the details of the questions which appear in TWZ28 – sorry, TWZ8 to the papers, that is the letter that the Commission sent setting out the questions and the answers given my client.  It is – you cannot look at that evidence in a vacuum and say well, because you did not have a right to cross-examine Mr Dukwana who gave evidence on an aspect of the Free State asbestos audit, therefore any other evidence outside of that, despite it being related to the Free State asbestos audit is permitted before you are allowed to cross-examine Mr Dukwana.  That, with respect, is looking at the issues in vacuum whereas if one looks at the purpose of my client being called today to give evidence it is clear, it is evidence related to the Free State asbestos audit. Now simply to say well, I am going to ask for my learned friend to say I am going to ask questions – sorry…    That is correct, he has cooperated in accordance with his tender.    But the point I am simply making is this, one cannot just divorce that evidence from – and ignore all of the evidence that has already been given by Mr Dukwana and look at the evidence …[intervenes]    The purpose is simple this, that before my client is called …[intervenes]    Sorry…    Yes.    The purpose is this, Mr Commissioner, before my client is called into a very public forum to be asked questions relating to the Free State asbestos audit, he should be given an opportunity to cross-examine the very witness that the Commission relies upon in respect of that particular aspect of the Commission.  Mr Dukwana has been the witness that the Commission has relied on, has been the witness, call it the complainant, so to speak, in respect of this Free State asbestos audit.  Now to simply look at Mr Dukwana’s evidence in isolation is, with respect, inappropriate because before my client is then asked to get into the witness box in a public forum such as this where his reputation may be affected, where he may suffer defamation, where he may be asked unnecessary questions, he surely should be given an opportunity to cross-examine the very witness that the Commission is relying upon to continue with this evidence on the Free State asbestos audit. And that really is the point, that you cannot separate the evidence, you cannot simply look at Mr Dukwana’s evidence in complete isolation to the evidence that is now being sought to be led today by the Commission.    That is it, I have got no further …[intervenes]    Those are my submissions.    I just implore Mr Commissioner not to look at the evidence completely in isolation to what Mr Dukwana has already laid as the basis for this Commission to proceed to question my client on the Free State asbestos audit.    Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record?    Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath?     Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?

MR ZULU:   Thabani Wiseman Zulu.     No.     Correct.     So help me God. THABANI WISEMAN ZULU  [d.s.s.]     Morning.     Right.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.     Noted Chair.      159, yes.     148, yes got it.     Yes.     Yes.     155?  Correct.     Yes, it is.     Correct.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     173?     I am getting there.     Correct.     Correct.     At page 204.       Yes, dated 14 May 2020.     Correct.     Correct that is correct Mr Chair.     I said it is correct and I know that.     If you can elaborate.     Yes, I know him.      Yes.     235?     Page 35?     Sorry just help me with the page number?     Just help me with the page number on the bundle.       Black numbers that is…[intervenes]      Yes, it starts with 0157.     On their Chair, thank you.     Director General, Department of Human Settlement.     Correct. ADV PRETORIUS     Correct.     Chair I am not sure whether you are referring to the paragraph that talks about business plans national department being responsible for that…[intervenes]      Okay.     Alright.      Correct.     Correct, Chairperson.       Yes, Chair.     I will agree with that proposition in so far as the national business plan was that falls under the jurisdiction of the Director General of the Department of Human Settlements.  In that context I will agree with that statement.     I am saying in the context that all projects that are being undertaken by different provincial departments are managed under the department of national department.  So in that context including their business plans.      Yes.     It is a joint responsibility.  The supervision is also within the Accounting Officers at a provincial level…[intervenes]     And the national department because it approves the business plans also has an oversight over those plans.  So it is a dual responsibility…[intervenes]     I did not hear your first words when you started your sentence Mr Pretorius if you can please repeat your first words.     Correct.     If you want me to elaborate on that I can what I mean by that.      Accounting Officers responsibility of course in consultation with other structures.     Correct?     Oh sorry.     My apologies Chair it is just that he is asking me.     I will try and balance my body language.      Okay, Chair.     Just elaborate on that.     All business plans that are approved first at a provincial level and then submitted at national level for confirming the availability of the budget are aligned with the existing budgets.       Under normal circumstances that is how it is supposed to be.       Yes.     That I was the Director General of the department?     I have already confirmed that earlier on in the beginning Chair, yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair the budget that is approved in the beginning of every financial year it is the first budget approved every quarterly session that you will have as a DG or as an Accounting Officer with your respective Accounting Officers of the provincial departments would be to seek the exact implementation of that particular budget as was budgeted from the beginning.            And along the lines then the budgets can be reviewed and if necessary, also business plans can also be reviewed depending on the needs analysis or as circumstances as they may change as I have indicated earlier on.     Correct.    It is correct but I would like to give context to that as well Chairperson.    It may not be that there is no budget available at a provincial level.  It may be that there is budget but it is not allocated for a specific project that you may want to do.    But if you want to review therefore your business plan you will have to get the National Department through its Accounting Officer to allow that review.  So it may not be necessarily that you have to get an additional budget.    It may be for example that a particular project has not been implemented timeously for whatever reasons procurement delays or any other circumstances and want to redirect your budget.    You are changing your business plan and therefore you need National Accounting Officer to do that.    Correct.    It is correct.      You mean the revised business plan.    Correct.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Sorry where are we in this bundle?    Where are we on this bundle?    100?    I found it Chair.    Well Chair it is quite an old letter but surely.    It is my signature so I would make an ex –     I will make an assumption that it is the letter that I wrote at the time.    Yes it is my signature.    Yes it is my signature.    Yes I hope so.  It will be nice to know which letter was I responding to or I just – I will doubt if I just rock up and just wrote this letter surely, I might have been.    No I have read it Chair.    I am just saying.    To get the right context before I wrote this one.    Maybe I was responding to Mr Mokhesi’s enquiry of something which I am saying then it will give a better context for me to talk better on this letter.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.  Alright.    Yes it is correct and again it confirms the point I made earlier that most probably if the letter that I might have been responding to will – will give me a better sense of why I had to mention this.  But I could have been reminding the Accounting Officer which is my responsibility at National that if you want to make any changes on your business plan first you must make sure that there is budget allocation for that.  But secondly also to put into the responsibility and accountability for any changes we make that financially and budget wise they remain the sole responsibility of a provincial department.      Correct.    This document is too faint I cannot read it.    It is not too good but I think it is document itself.    It is a small – it is a very small font and it is faint.  I do not know if you wanted to read it for me?    No.  Actually, the problem is not with the light.    It is the copy itself.    It is the quality of the copy.    Thanks Chair.    Yes, yes I do.    Yes Chair.  Yes, yes Chair.    No I have already done that.    This communication it is in 2014.      I can only say Chair.  I can only say Chair because it is not signed by me so I can only …    I can only say that probably.    That is 2014.    I could have the context I am just saying Sir it is 14.    I am just saying it is 2014.    So most probably I would have sent such an email.    Based again on what …    Unfortunately when you jump into…    Correspondence like this.     It would have, an event that would have happened.    That will give context to this.    Now I can only make assumptions.    That most probably …    Most probably there was a revised business plan I will make that assumption.    Which needed the attention of the Director General.    Upon which – upon which you needed to check the relevance of the revised business plan.    Ja.    Probably absolutely Chair.    Ja absolutely Chair.    Correct.    Correct.  Correct Chair.    Correct.    Yes it is.    Yes correct.    That is what it is yes.    Yes but…    That is in terms of the process of doing the project.    Ja.    That is the overall…    That is the overall objective Chair.    But of course, it has got phases of how you go about doing that.  You do not just wake up and remove asbestos – there is a process.    But the overall objective is exactly what you are alluding to Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    I think Mr Mokhesi would be better placed to give that context.    I was saying – I was saying Chair.  I think the HOD who wrote this is better placed to give a context in terms of the pricing structure of the project.    I do not assume that.    Ja.    Yes Chair but…    What I am saying Chair is that the context of pricing for the project has got – I will assume it had different phases.  So I would not say it is all inclusive in terms of the pricing structure.  I would not know that.    So I am saying the HOD is the Accounting Officer is better placed to give context into what this pricing meant.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    But that will be – that will be in the detail of the project itself.    If you hear what I am saying.    Because every project it has got different phases.    So that will be in the detail of the project.  I am not – that is why I am saying.    The best placed person is the Accounting Officer.  For me this was too high level if I were to put it to you that way.    So I would not like to interpret what the HOD meant with this.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    Yes.    Correct.      Correct.      Yes.      With the proviso that the person who is 01.34.      My understanding.      Yes.      Yes.      No, I do not, Chair, but if you are asking a further question to say is this what was meant by Mr Mogese?  Then that is a different question.      At a face value, yes, Chair.      At a face value, yes.      Exactly, yes.      Are we still on the same page?      Are we on the same page?      Okay.      Okay.      Where am I going – which one am I at now?      Which document, Chair?  Which document are we at?      Oh this one?      Oh, okay.      Let me …[intervenes]      Yes.      Yes.      Alright.      Does he need to take – to bring it back, Mr Pretorius, to answer?      Yes, Chair, if I may just…      I am not sure consultation, what it means, but in the context of consultation …[intervenes]      I have never met the investigators.      I have only submitted and affidavit to the investigators.      So I have never interacted with any of the investigators up to today.      Correct, .That is why I wanted to get a sense of the context of [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]      Yes, I am there, 210.      Correct. ADV PRETORIUS      Yes, I am there.      Correct.      Correct.      Correct.      Yes, I am there, thank you.      Just go to the paragraph on page 209 that you are referring to?      Okay.      Yes.      Correct.      Yes.      Yes, Chair, as per the motivation submitted.      As per that document that we spoke about earlier on.      Yes.      At the face value of it, yes, ja.      Yes, Chair.    [No audible reply]     Yes, Chair.  And that is an answer that was provided by the head of the department of... that of Department of Free State.  So that ...[intervenes]     From that, yes.    In order to agree with the revised business plan.    Yes.    Yes, again provided by the actual head, Free State.    It was not a complete information at this stage Mr Pretorius.  Let me maybe state that.  This was the first motivation that was submitted which were needed at a high-level to agree on the revised business plan.    So there could have been more information that the actual HOD would have had at his disposal that may have not been part of this first information.    Yes ...[intervenes]     The point I am making Chair is that the information provided by the HOD, as per the revised business plan, may not have all the information about the project itself but this is the information that was given to me ...[intervenes]     ...at a face value.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    In any event Chairperson, once the plan is revised there are then other follow-ups.    When then, in any event, have a responsibility to check the business plan.    So the point I am making.    This could have not been the only information that overall was available.    So I am trying to make that to be clearly understood.    Ja.    Just repeat that.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.  Correct, yes.    It is a required process as I have explained earlier Chair.    Yes, you see ...[intervenes] ‘    Yes, that is what I said earlier.  That is what I am trying to say, I have explained how they... the business plan at national level works.  And in the process of changes, what is also required in terms of the process.    Ja.    Okay.    Yes, correct Chair.    [No audible reply]     Which page?    On which page is it?    On which page?    Sorry?    Oh, okay.    [No audible reply]  And that concerns the procurement process that preceded the appointment of the joint venture in the Free State.  But it is necessary to go back a stage to what happened in Gauteng. The issue that needs clarification is the nature of Blackhead’s appointment in Gauteng, and by Blackhead, I mean Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited, not the joint venture. Do you recall that Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited provided services to the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements?    As was informed and requested by the HOD of the Free State, yes.    The request... Chair, just to be specific.  The request that was made by the HOD to revise the business plan was in line with the work that Blackhead was doing in Gauteng.  So that is the context I am giving.    To the appointment of Blackhead by Free State or by Gauteng?    Yes, it was done by Gauteng, Chair.  So I would not be involved with the appointment of the company in department where I am not accountable for.      So I cannot be responsible for it internally.    Not necessarily Chair.  Let me explain.    My responsibilities as the National Director General of Human Settlements is when you want to revise your business plan.    You see the necessary approval.  Amongst those approvals is to consult the National Department.  The appointments of service providers at a provincial level, is not the responsibility of the accounting officer at national level.    So let us be clear about that ...[intervenes]     ....so that we do not confuse it.    I do think ...[intervenes]     I do not have jurisdiction in the provincial departments for the appointments and all of that.    No, Chair.  What I am saying is.  I do not appoint ...[intervenes]     Yes.    Yes.    It is correct Chair.    I cannot approve the business plan.    Okay Chair.    Okay Chair.    Ja.    If they would have done so Chair, they would have done it un-procedurally.    Exactly Chair.    Correct Chair.    But that does not stop them.  That is the point I am trying to make Chair.    Yes.    Ja.    From continuing with the project irrespective of my decision not to approve the revised business plan.    But if they were to do so, they would do so incorrectly or un-procedurally.    If for somebody from the accounting office, yes.    Yes.    Correct Chair.  Correct.    Correct Chair.    Correct.  Correct Chair.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    The approval of the revised business plan.    [No audible reply]     Sorry, page Mr Pretorius?    Yes?    Yes.    Chair, it is quite, again, a very old appointment but I would assume because it is seen by myself, this would be an appointment at national. And the reason for that would be as simple as, I do not have jurisdiction to appoint any service provider at a provincial level.  So this would be my submission right now.    A national appointment.  And if I look at the title of this letter, it will be only but one service provider.  It will be a combination of different service provides.  All form part of the... of your PRT’s ...[intervenes]     A panel at international level.  So I would assume if I were to go back and check the records of the department, this will not have not been the only company that is appointed to be part of the PRT’s.      But that will be inclination for now.    Yes.  Yes, it is correct Chair.    Chair, it will depend.  At national level it will be a different system that we use for this and for provincial departments.  Again, they have their own authorities.  So we appear at that level as well.  So this is only for national purposes.      But of course, provincial departments may have an access to that information.    Correct.  Correct.    Sorry, what page?    Yes, I do.    Is it the same as the document that I ...[intervenes]     No, it does not look the same.    [No audible reply]     Yes, Chair.  But I would not know the context of the... of this letter.  So if you say it is consistent.  I am not sure in which context was this letter been written by ...[intervenes]     [No audible reply]     Yes, Chair.  But let me contextualise it once again.  But when Blackhead was being considered by the Free State Department of Human Settlements to do the work for the asbestos, I did not use this appointment that was done by the national department for the panel.    I want to give that context earlier so that there is no confusion because they have used the Gauteng process.    So I wanted to be clear.  So this would not have been applicable in the usage because the terms of reference for the panel and for asbestos were two different things.  I just want to give that clarity so that it is... the information is not misconstrued.      That is my understanding.  I did not write this letter but I am just trying to interpret what I said already.    Ja.    Yes, as I have explained Chair.  The appointment that you are referring you is an appointment of different service providers to a panel not to do any work by the national department, not any work.  It is to be appointed ...[intervenes]     Just to get on... and it ends there.    Absolutely.    Correct.      So just help me, Mr Pretorius, which letter are you referring to that talks about a bid?      The one that I sent?      The one for the panel?      Yes, it refers to a panel appointed by the national department.      Yes.      That is why I am saying, Chair, it depends n the writer, what was the contents of raising this in this fashion.  I would not be able to give context to that because I did not write that letter.      But I am just …[intervenes]      Yes.  I was saying the bid that I referred to and the letters, not just one letter, that were written to different service providers to become the members of the panel, that was done by national department but they were not appointed to do any specific work for the national department until such time that there is a need for their services, a normal procurement process will follow. So, as far as I am concerned, that is where it ended with my responsibility at national level. Obviously, accounting when they do their work they check certain things, they do certain things, I am not aware of that because that is outside my scope.  I am talking about something that has fallen within my scope in terms of the letter that you are referring to.      But the point I am trying to clarify, Chair, so that we are not lost, the application of 16.A it has nothing to do with the national department, I just want to make that point clear.      Which letter are you talking about now?      There are two letters, which one are you talking about?      The one that I personally did?      That one was only for the panel, it has nothing to do with appointing a service provider to do the work on this project.      Correct but you are in a panel, you are not appointed to do any specific work.      The panel, the letter that I have written to service providers was to appoint them to a panel at national level it has nothing to do with any work that the province is doing, any province [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]      It includes all departments.      Excuse me?      Which project is unrelated?      No, the panel that we appointed, Chairperson, had to do with national department of human settlements.     To have service providers within the panel.      That is outside the scope.        Of the provincial departments.      They can even have their own panels [indistinct – dropping voice]      This one that I did was specifically for the national department of Human Settlements.      Through a procurement process.      As and when [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]      Correct.      Correct.      Correct.      A process to be …[intervenes]      Correct.      If you are outside this panel, yes.      Because you would have not qualified to be on the panel.      Yes, correct, Chair.      Correct.      Correct, Chair.      I was aware of the fact that?      For a [indistinct – dropping voice] submission [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]      Yes, as per the submission that made and giving the affidavit of Mr Mokhesi, yes.      No, that is my understanding, Chair, that it has got nothing to do with the national department as far as I am concerned.      Correct because of the specifications, that is how I have learnt or understood the …[intervenes]      Yes.      Yes.      That is correct, Chair.      It is correct.      If you are using this provision, there are certain parties that must give consent.      Amongst those parties it is your service provider.      Chair, I will prefer that at least the actually can give context to the letter because …[intervenes]      As I have been explaining …[intervenes]      Yes, as I have been explaining, Chair, …[intervenes]      Right.      Correct, Chair.      I would think so, Chair.      That is why I was saying, Chair, it depends in which context was the HOD referring to, to make reference into that.      How would he know that.       He may have done some research to check the validity.      Of the existence of this company.      And which service centres exist, whether National Treasury or in the department where this particular company is a vendor.  I am not sure of the contents.      But under normal circumstances.      Because this is not a contract that exists between National Department …[intervenes]      And the Blackhead doing any work.      Then you would not piggyback on that.      Because this company is only on a panel.      It is not having an existing contract.      That contract, my understanding after reading all the documents that were sent to me, was that it existed.      Between the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements and the service provider.      But not with the national department.      Thank you, Chair, I always avoid interpreting other people’s letters.      Because you never know the context within which a particular letter is written.      And then you start making allegations of saying somebody is wrong as an accounting officer whereas there could have been a reason to contextualise it in this fashion.      Which I am not privy to, so it is in that context, Chair.      Correct.      Yes.      Having read the documents that were forwarded to me, that would be my understanding, Chair.      And also, having understood the request that was put to me as the accounting officer at the time to revise the plan, it was in that context.      Not at national.      I think in terms of PFMA that would be correct.      I will say basically all affected parties, Chair.      I see so, Chair.     In the same pack?        I am getting there.      No, I was just waiting before you finish your statements, I was not nodding because …[intervenes]       Yes, it is the letter we spoke about earlier.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes, that is what it is saying here, Chair, …[intervenes]      Again, sir, it depends what is it that a particular accounting officer is looking for.      So it all depends.  If he was looking for my confirmation that this particular service provider is part of the national panel resource team that I have in a particular context and I have asked for that.  But if he was asking for an existing …[intervenes]      But he is asking for a contract …[intervenes]      [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]      Yes.      This is what I am trying to …[intervenes]      But this is what I am saying, Chair, I do not have a contract with Blackhead at national level with my accounting officer at the time.      yes.      That could be what he is asking, Chair, depending on what he meant.      It could be wanting to confirm if there is a contract.      Yes, Chair.      Yes, Chair.      Chair, I can only assume against this, I can only assume that the reference being made here is in reference to the panel because there was no existing contract at the time between the company and the national department in a contractual arrangement.   So I will have no powers to [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] contract.      Again, I am assuming, Chair.      Yes.      Yes, Chair.      Correct.      Correct, Chair.      Correct, Chair.      Correct.      8181.      Which one?     Yes, Chair I was writing to the SOD advising him on this letter and I’m sure I would have been responding to one of the correspondences that has made enquiries with my Department, I’ll assume. ADV PRETORIUS      That’s why I’m saying, most probably Chair, I was responding to an enquiry that has been made with my office and I was providing the necessary advice, based on that enquiry which I’m not sure, it could even have been a telephone conversation or it could have been any other form of communication but surely when I was putting this, clearly I was responding to something.      Yes, and I will assume Chair, that the enquiry was in line with the intended purpose of what the Accounting Officers wanted to do and obviously you cannot use the National Department because there was no contractual obligation exist between National Department and Blackhead which is the issue, maybe, I was trying to clarify but as I’m saying I was probably responding to a particular enquiry, which form it took, I may not be sure of.    Gauteng contract?         Yes.      Yes.      Alright.      Yes, I think in the context of this situation because I don’t think you want me to give a lecture, how this works, I think we all know how it works but in the context of this letter, Chair, I think the advice being given here is the fact that the State organ, that has a contractual, existing  obligation, is Gauteng Province, it’s not the National Department, it’s got a panel and that’s the only State organ that you can apply this provision that is being sought here but not the National Department and therefore if you need this to be processed correctly and procedurally you’ll have to deal with the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements which is a State organ that has similar terms of reference for the intended assignment, in this context.      Absolutely, Chair, there was no existing contractual arrangement between…[intervenes].      Except for being a panellist.      Correct.      Which letter are you referring to, is it not this one?      Oh 181 yes.      I missed your question, sorry.      Yes.      Correct.      Well this is the point – and Chair, I hate to make assumptions and I’ve noticed that you don’t appreciate it and I apologise for that because I could have been trying to clarify a point here and again – because this is as far back as 2014 so I could have been clarifying the point that if you have an intention to participate on an existing contract, clearly there isn’t one that exists between the Department of National Human Settlement and Blackhead.  The only Department that, will only have an existing contract will be the Gauteng and clearly, therefore, I could not be the Accounting Officer that will have the powers vested with him to actually approve even the participation of Blackhead in a contract because there isn’t a contract that exists between National Department.  So, I think I was trying to provide clarity to a point of, even indicating that financial obligations for this will still be squarely with the Free State Department which want to participate in that.  So that’s a contract that exist with Gauteng that does not exist with National Department of…[intervenes].      Chair I would, Chair, assume that the HOD would have shared that with me.      Yes Chair.      Because this was a communication that was happening between the HOD and myself.  So, probably he would have shared that with me and I would have then been expected to provide clarity in terms of Treasury Regulations.      Correct.      Again, I must indicate Chair, that, again this is also on interpretation basis, some people interpret statutes differently.      I’m only providing what…[intervenes].      Yes.      Absolutely and I am informed by the statutes.     Correct.      I guess.      Sorry Mr Pretorius, which page is that?      Sorry about that, please proceed.       Correct.      Yes, Chair, under normal circumstances that’s how it’s done, that’s why you participate on an existing contract, so the terms and conditions and financials are normally expected to be seen.  If there’s a deviation for that, surely there should be a reason for that.      Chair, may I please request a comfort break?      Please may I request a comfort break for two minutes?      Two minutes, it’s fine.    FS8.    Contradict what?    Chair that I have no clue of that and it has got nothing to do with me.    The R1 million one I have no clue about that.    But the R600 000.00 yes.    Okay that is why I wanted to make sure that I do not agree on something that combines both yes.    Oh okay especially to R1 million.  But to R600.000.00 yes I do.    No.    If I may Chair?    I can only speculate that it could be that Mr Ntuli was introduced to Sodi by myself.      In my business that I do in Pietermaritzburg.    So that could be the reason but other than that I would not know but I have no benefit whatsoever that was associated with that payment personally.    Yes.    That is the person that I am referring to Chair.    Mabheleni yes.    I presume so in terms of the spelling yes indeed.    I think that would be correct Chair.    Yes.  Point that the Chair is making that the way the name is spelt might be incorrect that is the point he is trying to make.    No I would not know the spelling but I think the Chair.    I am saying that could be the reason.    Mr Sodi yes.    Correct.    The question was…    Yes I think that is how I have – that is how I have known him.    I would not know that.    No.    No.    It is because those transactions I do not get involved with. When people used references Chair especially for this particular thing, I have no comment to make on those transactions.    For his own …    No.    Yes.    Yes correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    And I was not a beneficiary of that transaction.    No.    Correct Chair.    Well Chair I come from KwaZulu Natal born and bred in Pietermaritzburg so I also run businesses myself in Pietermaritzburg which at the time I have declared.  And one of the businesses is the hospitality industry.    One of the businesses in hospitality industry which is called Teza Lounge which I have declared.  So this is where I have met Mr Ntuli visiting my place but also Mr Sodi was also a customer of my place as well.    So I have known them in the business social circles.    And I could confirm that I actually introduced Ntuli to Mr Sodi.    Introduced Mduli to Sodi.    So I wanted to show this from Gauteng.    But he has got... his homestead is well in KZN.    It happened in Gauteng.    Yes, I would think so.    Shu, Chair it was ...[intervenes]     I cannot remember but I have known him for quite some time.    But I cannot remember exactly.    I would not remember Chair.    No.    Social contact.    Social contacts Chair.    Yes.    Correct Chair.  Correct Chair.    I would think so Chair.    I do not know ...[intervenes]     Yes, but I can assure that it was in relation to...      Yes.    No, I am...    Okay.    I am called by a different name.  So.  Otherwise, they call me TZ.  Otherwise, they called me Tamari.  Or as they called me Digi.  So people used different names that relate to me in their own rights.  I do not really choose how to do it Chair.    It is one of them.  Correct.    That is even my Lounge.    Yes.  They even called me Lounge, my business, TZ.    Correct.  Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    So much correct so Chair, if I may add, at the balance of eight... I have to go to the bank to ask for a loan but also to confirm that at the time I was an accounting officer.  I had an obligation to declare the vehicle which I did.    Yes, that was for the deposit of the car that is under questioning.    That R 600 000,00?    I do not want to discuss cash deposits.  My understanding, if I may explain, was that a deposit for the car was R 690 000,00.  R 600 000,00 is the amount that was paid on the 21 s t.    By Sodi, yes.    And then the R 90 000,00 was for the wheels which I did not change later.  So I never paid R 90 000,00.    The total deposit for the car was R 690 000,00 but R 90 000,00 was to cover the wheels which I did not change which I intended to do on the car.  So the R 600 000,00 was paid to Sodi.    So the cash deposits, I do not know how their bookings are done.    The cash deposits that he is referring to, Mr Pretorius, is the same deposit that was paid.    The R 690 000,00.    That is how I understood it Chair.    I do wish that Duminy can explain that how...[intervenes]     No.  Oh, no.  I did not pay the R 90 000,00.  It fell off because I did not change the wheels.    I thought he is referring to cash deposits.    Like someone went and pay the cash deposits.  It is still transferred by Mr Sodi.    If one... I am not sure.  I would say for my benefit.    Let us contextualise it because ...[intervenes]  [Parties are intervening each other and cannot be heard clearly.]    It was paid as an amount of money that was owed to me which I directed to the dealership Chair.    So if that is what you mean by benefit ...[intervenes]     ...then I can say yes.    But it was not like as a benefit that...    It came all through my businesses.    Yes, Chair.    Yes.    [No audible reply]     Correct.    Thank you, Chair.  Yes, there will be documents because... of course, the debt is far back as 2015.  So I am sure if the investigators, which I was hoping Chair, they would have done, to consult with me to check any information to that effect.   Unfortunately, that was not done.  But if the Commission were to ask for me to... it goes as far back as 2015.  If there is any information that one could find that I could do.   I was hoping, actually, all the questions, that the investigators would come to me and go and dig deep in terms of the question that Mr Pretorius is asking.    But unfortunately, that did not happen.    It was a verbal instruction.    Correct.    We normally do stocktaking in my business Chair.  As you will understand that township business, you normally write down things.  And during this period, I was doing the same thing with my team.   And instead of taking the money, I decided to just start and go and deliver the money where I wanted them to deliver it upon my instruction.    We do events Chair.    We sell food.    Food.  Catering.    We also sell liquor.    We also have a sports bar in it.    But mainly, we are more strong on events on special days.    Where we host different people to come and present themselves by singing or doing different events and pay them for those activities.    And then also sell the stuff that we have.    So it is... that is how busy it gets in terms of its overall...    It is based in township just before you get out of the township called Sobanto.    No, It is Sobanto.    Sobanto Township, yes.    That is where it has been, yes.    And it is declared... I did declare it as part of the record.    Correct Chair.    Correct.    We had a machine to swipe, which was FNB.  And again, Chair.  These are the questions ...[intervenes]     I am saying we had the machine, FNB machine to swipe the card.    That was one option.    The other option was cash.      Or you write down ...[intervenes]     A tap?    [laughs]  I am very careful about the... [laughs]    [laughs]  I knew he will get into that questions Mr Pretorius.    That is why you be careful.  You cannot run a tap of R 600 000,00.    Mr Sodi... it is not a tap.  You place an order... we also deliver alcohol to different people you place an order, we deliver it to you.   At times, you do not have to pay on the spot but we put our system in place to make sure that at the right time, you must pay what is required of you to pay for. If you want to swipe, you also swipe.  As I am saying Chair, there is an FNB machine inside the lounge that we are using if you want to swipe.  So we use different forms of payments.    Chair ...[intervenes]     At that time Chair, it will be mainly the orders that he will place.    Of liquor in particular.    Because he used to be at KZN to host different dignitaries ...[intervenes]     At KZN.    Yes, to host different dignitaries at his own homestead.    And he will ask me to buy stuff for him and give it to him on his arrival.    Such as ...[intervenes]     I am sure he will explain better on that Chair.  But mainly it was for him to host his guests.    At his own house.    To entertain his own guests.  That was my understanding.    Over a certain period Chair.    Correct, correct.    It was mainly in 2015.    It was mainly in 2015.    Yes, yes.    I think almost for about three years or so.    If I am not mistaken.    Ja.  I cannot be specific Chair.    Yes, Chair.  And at times, he can treat himself.    Correct, yes.    Ja, at times there will be written documents.    There will be diaries where the order is written down and the amounts of money, all are written down.    There would be those kind of things to make sure that I track down my customers.  He was not the only customer with the same arrangement.    There were other customers.    Correct Chair.    There was still some Chair.  It was... there was more.  I think it was about six hundred and four, if I am not mistaken.    Four.  If I am not mistaken.    Yes.    But this is the amount I needed to do the deposit which I directed.      Chair, I am loud now?       At the time, I think, if I am not mistaken now.      Yes.      Correct, Chair.      No, I would not have, Chair, because that was my arrangement with the dealership.      That was informed by the …[intervenes]      Yes, exactly, correct.      Yes, Chair.      Via cash.      Yes, Chair.      Across the board, some small, I mean …[intervenes]      You will understand, Chair, the township business, you have got different clientele.       So my clientele was of different calibre.      Because of the provision of service.      That I was providing, so I have a special clientele that I have targeted for my business for obvious reasons.      So there will be different categories of people at different levels of their income level.      Chair, I could check the log books that have been used by myself.      But I can also check the diaries, if they still exist, which they used to keep.      This is what I thought maybe the investigators will be interested upon them having gone into my account.      But unfortunately they never did.      Correct.      Occasionally, yes.      Correct.      Yes, at times I would deliver alcohol to him at …[intervenes]      2015, yes.      At the time, yes.      Yes, by swiping.      Yes, as I have said, they will use different payments, those who want to pay via credit cards, they use credits cards, those who want to pay …[intervenes]      Chair, I am not sure, I can double-check that.  There was a time when the credit card system that we were using was not functioning but I can assure that there was a point when that facility was fully functional but I can double check that.      Correct.      Just repeat the question?      Yes?      Yes.      Correct.      No, it is not a legal entity on its own, I was trading it as T Z Lounge.      I was trading it as T Z Lounge.      Correct.  That is a trade name.      Correct, correct.      Correct, at that time together with my wife, ja.      Yes.      And entity …[intervenes]      Yes, at the time, yes, together with my wife.      Yes, correct.  Alright, let us put it like that, it is the way the …[intervenes]      Yes, yes.      Yes.      I think it is Brooding, if I am not mistaken.      Brooding, if I am not mistaken.      B-r-o-o-d-i-n-g.      Yes.  I am not sure what your investigators did found though, Chair, that is why will say I would have preferred that such level of detail was being sought rather than…      If you hear what I am saying.      That is the cry I have always had because I availed myself to give all the information as required and I do not think, Chair, with all due respect, that to make reference to my wife when I have not been given that opportunity as well because …[intervenes]      No, okay, in your view, if that is your view, that is fine.      I am saying, Chair, the questions are already provided, all the answers to investigators, anything even when they wanted that information and I have never been given that opportunity to say come and tell us about this detail.  Now one of the reason I was asking myself why am I just brought into the Commission, having not answered the questions and I knew at the back of my mind the type of the questions that Mr Pretorius would be asking in a public platform whereas all that information is available and I have no intention whatsoever to hide that information.      You were saying something about a certain company, Mr Pretorius, you were saying something about a certain other company under my name in Pietermaritzburg.      I would not know.  How would I know that?      I know all the competitors in my space.  I know all of them in my space that is why I am saying I need to get a …[intervenes]      Not that I know of.      Did I offer?      I was never asked to offer any documentation, Chair.  No one has asked me to offer any documentation and no one has ever even called me into a meeting and asked me about this.  It is the first time that I am here and answer those questions.,      Because nobody has asked me about my bank accounts, people just went into my bank account.  Nobody has asked me about my bank account.  This is one of the  reasons, Chair, that to some extent I did not appreciate the way investigators have dealt with me.  I offered to provide all the information in my first affidavit. I offered for my own banking statements to be made available for any transaction.  I offered that myself on the affidavit.  That never happened.  So I am just trying to say, Chair, the information that Mr Pretorius is referring to, no one has even asked me for that documentation.      I think he was just using the book, Chair.      Let us put it like that.      Correct.      No, I hear you, Chair, and I hear the angle that you are coming from.  I think, Chair, maybe it is because this transaction, from where I am sitting, was above board transaction.  So much so that the product in question, it is a product that I have declared.  So it is above board, so much so that the balance of it appears in financial statements.  So if you go to the financial institution that provide that loan for it, so it is the product that is above board.  So there was no secrecy around it.  There was no way I was going to hide it and I have no intention.   Maybe it was in that context that I was saying if anybody wants me to cooperate and provide any form of information on anything that is suspicious of, I am available and this particular product in particular, it is a product that I declared.  So I have an obligation at that time to declare my business and to declare any property that I own, which I did.  But even if I did not want to declare it, there is a bank that confirms that you get money to buy the product and I am still paying for that loan for that matter. So maybe it is because of that context that the investigators were going to in any event find the information that I have declared as required, Chair.      Maybe it is in that context that I never bothered that much because I said I am available to provide the information.      Correct.      Page 159?      Yes, yes, I do, 519.      Well, it is general, so …[intervenes]      He says government officials, but I am talking about …[intervenes]      Correct.      I heard you.      Okay.      Yes, Chair, I am there.     Correct.     No, Chair, that’s not correct, the statement here says, and I’ll read it myself, and I won’t read the last paragraph because the last paragraph is preceded by the statement, that appears to be – or let me just read the whole paragraph, Chair, so that the context is not lost.   “I deny emphatically that insofar as the  Annexure, which includes the initials TZ, if the Annexure is real, I will deal with this later, however, the abovementioned minute appears to be that I received R10million, part of the Free State asbestos eradication project for no justifiable reason whatsoever and apparently there’s a corrupt reason.” That I still deny, as I’m sitting here in this Commission, I still deny Chair, I did not get any money of R10million as was appearing on the spreadsheet of Mr Dukwana as a beneficiary.  So, I will put it to Mr Pretorius that I still remain with the statement that I did not get any money as it appears on this spreadsheet, as a beneficiary.   So, as you are putting it to me, I’m not sure from which context Mr Pretorius is saying he’s putting it to me that I did get the money, I find that to be quite offensive…[intervenes].     Please let him explain to me…[intervenes].     But I’ve already explained, Chair how that money…[intervenes].     It is in that context, Chair.     Okay.     Not at all.     Not at all Chair.     Chair, when you run a business, for your monies to be paid to you that are owed to you, you use different methodologies.     Amongst of those is to use the banking systems which I have also alluded to.  We have used with a machine inside the business.      Yes, I agree Chair.     But the point I was making, Chair, which is the reference that is being made to my affidavit.     Which is the issue, Chair, that I think, earlier on you deliberated on with the Senior Counsel.     Because that’s a – that’s is where we are today because of that spreadsheet.     And I’d like to say to this Commission, Chair, I’m not a beneficiary of that spreadsheet.     I’d like to state it, as I did it on my affidavit I am not that’s why I had an interest to talk to Mr Dukwana myself to get a sense, why did he concluded on that but I was, further, hoping that when investigations are happening, this point will come out clear.     But with all due respect, Chair, with all due respect, Chair, it cannot be that today I’m sitting here because of that allegation made by Mr Dukwana and when I’m here today, I’m told that’s why – I wouldn’t be here today if it was not for the statement made by Mr Dukwana in that affidavit.     I’ll respect your position, I wouldn’t like to argue further, I’ll respect your position.     Thank you Chair.      Chair I don’t want to sound repetitive, I offered, I was not asked.      Correct.      Sorry just repeat the first sentence, I played what?      Accounting role.      Yes, let’s qualify it.      Okay.      Correct.      Correct, I’m not sure about frequently, though Chair.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair.     Correct Chair.     It’s a fact Chair and I responded.     I did Chair.     Chair, I think, if I may comment on that.     I think there has been a communication gap I picked up.    Between the investigators and my legal team.     Which affected negatively.     The work of the investigators together with myself.     As a result of that, I cannot say I had that opportunity.     Up until I had to respond in writing.     If you read all the documents, you’ll see the gaps that have been happening in communication and then there are breaks, at times of almost five months.     And then I’m caught between my legal team and the investigators.     And I couldn’t go directly to investigators when there are protocols that have been established.     Within which one wanted to respect them.  I think, Chair, when you read those communications, you’ll see that has also contributed to some extent, negatively in making sure that opportunities used and that’s a comment I will make sure but you’ll see it in all correspondence.  That has been the mishap.     Chair, I want to assure you, in my personal capacity, that I’ve never had an option of not working with the Commission.     I’ve always made it a point, in all my affidavits, both of them, that at any given moment I’m here to work and cooperate at the Commission and I’d like to state it on record, that commitment remain.      This is the point, Chair, again we are going back to the protocols…[intervenes].     This is the protocols I’m talking about Mr Pretorius, that we had different lines of communication and each time investigators would come to me, I’ll speak to them and then I’ll ask them, do we start a new process, should I deal with you directly or you want to go through via my legal team and then they will agree, they’ll go via my legal team, then there will be breakdown of communication.  Then I will continue with life, so, honestly speaking, Mr Pretorius, the information that investigators may have wanted, exactly the same way that you have requested it, it would have been provided to them.  You can talk to Ettienne, I will speak to him, I will commit myself, I will respond to him via email, myself, I won’t even refer him to my lawyers, I will do it myself.  So, it’s unfortunate, Chair, that those protocols for me – at some point I even asked him, how does this work because I can’t break protocol with my legal team. At the same time, he is coming to me directly and I’ll commit myself.  So, there was that challenge but that was not a sense of no cooperation from my side.      Yes. ADV PRETORIUS      Correct, via the legal team.      Via the legal team.      But Chair, that’s what I was saying, Chairperson, the information about R600 000 it’s an open secret, there was no way I was going to be able to hide that payment.  It forms part of – the current car that I have I’ve declared.  So, there was no intention, whatsoever, Chair, if they had come to me to say, we want the following, even my legal team, I would have volunteered the information because it’s in the public domain.  I don’t know if you hear what I’m saying, Chair, the financial situation, one gets there…[intervenes].      Chair, it is in the financial statement of my car, an amount of R600 000 was paid, it is available, it is there.     Exactly Chair.     So, you can’t hide it.     That’s the point I’m trying to make Chair.      I can’t remember exactly but…[intervenes].      Yes, correct.     He’s been a customer for my business.     Obviously in the process with a customer like that we developed a friendship yes.     Just an associate that visited.     Correct.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair, thank you Mr Pretorius. 
ZULU:  So every financial year the National Accounting Officer has a responsibility and duty in terms of the law to approve all business plans prior to budgets being allocated for implementation purposes.  And should there be a deviation we need to deviate from any process or any project during the implementation of those plans you will require the approval of the national department.    That was my understanding. My understanding was …[intervenes]    Yes, yes, he [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]    I am just [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] Chair.    It’s in relation to the spreadsheet…[intervenes].
