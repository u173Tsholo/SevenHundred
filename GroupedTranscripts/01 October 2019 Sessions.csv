CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Wentzel, good morning everybody.    Yes.  I understand you would like me to adjourn for a few minutes.    Put on your microphone.  Switch it on ja.    Okay no that is fine.  How much time do you need?    Maybe we should just say ten o’clock because if we say quarter to as we discussed and that might be too little time.    Let me give you enough time to get everything in order because when we start I really want us to get going.  I want us to finish Colonel Naidoo’s evidence today.    Ja.  Okay then we will take an adjournment and we will resume at ten o’clock.  We adjourn.    Good morning.  I said to Ms Wentzel this morning earlier it is just that I am not sure whether you were there to hear what I said.  I would like us to try and finish your evidence today.  So she will do the necessary from her part and we must just try and finish today.    Yes.  Obviously that is subject to the fact that we must not do any injustice to your evidence.     Ja.  But we – we do not have all the time in the world so we have got to make the best of the time that we have and use it fruitfully.  We do not want to leave any important fissures of your evidence but at the same time we want to move with some speed.  Okay?    Okay thank you.    Let me see.  You must please get somebody to look at certain pages in the bundle where the number of the page in terms of pagination is not legible or clear and have those so that you can have those pages replaced with copies that will make it clear what the page number is.  I mean some of them it might be that the number of the page should be written a little higher up where there is a space. Others they just need to complete replacement.  So one struggles to see what the number of the page is in regard to some of these.  So somebody could work on that while you are busy and then during the break that can be fixed.  It seems that you want this new affidavit to be – to come after page 140 is that right?  Did you hear me?  You did not?    Okay.  I have put it after page 140 I think that is where you wanted it to be.    Okay.    Just hang on one second.  The parts of – you remember that when you started with Colonel Naidoo’s evidence you did not start at the beginning.    You covered what comes much later in his statement namely the circumstances under which he was put on the witness protection program.    From what page to what page does that go?  Where    Yes.  Okay.  Now yesterday we went up to what page of his statement?    Page 19.    So that leaves us with about 30 pages to cover.    Is there a reason why we should take longer than an hour to finish ten pages with annexures?  What do you think?    Maybe let us aim for that.    And see if – if it goes a little over or under that is fine but let us aim for that because – but as long as we finish today.    That is important.    Yes.    Well why – you remember we said whatever will be in this file will be – will be – will form part of Exhibit KK1.1.  We said we are doing away with 1.2.    So therefore that affidavit should not be a separateexhibit.    It should just be part of what is in Exhibit.    1.    Ja 1.1.    So do not refer to it as Exhibit K1.2.    It is just one of the supplementary affidavit or documents in this exhibit.    Ja.    I am sorry.    Spoke very softly please raise your voices.    The new – new supplementary – the supplementaryaffidavit it is page where your name is – where it says “I the undersigned” is page 141 and it goes up to page 153 and there is a letter which I think is an annexure page 154.  That is the supplementary affidavit that she is talking about.    It is your affidavit?    Yes.  Ja okay thank you.    Yes.    Yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.    Yes.    Aha.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay.  Yes Ms Wentzel.    Colonel Naidoo one of the difficulties I understand that Ms Wentzel has is or both of you have is that because you cannot see each other sometimes you are expecting her to lead and she is expecting you to continue and both of you do not know and that is why sometimes there is silence.  But let us try our best.    Yes okay.  Ms Wentzel.    It looks like R40 000.00 is quite a popular amount Colonel Naidoo in CI.    Yes.    What was that amount for?  What was the R40 000.00    It was for?    Oh okay alright.      Recruitment – recruitment fees?    Oh so when an informer is being recruited there is an advance amount that is paid?    In terms of what the amount would be?    Oh okay.    Okay alright yes continue.    Okay alright.    So it was not all going to go to the informer?    But was – were the records going to reflect that it was going – it was all going to the informer?    R20 000.00 was going to General Lala?    Or do you not know?    Because the records reflected that?    The moment part of it was not going to the informer then that meant there was something irregular?    Yes okay.  Continue.    Who was asking this question?    Explain the job of an advance holder in this setup?    Oh is that the person who processes all requests for advance payments?    Oh.  Does that person also make the decision or whether to approve the request for advance payment or not or does he or she simply check that the documentation is right and then sends it to somebody else who makes the decision?    Oh so the decision would have been made and he or    Oh so the particular advance holder asked or queried this particular claim?    But would the records not that – would not the paperwork that she had simply – would it not have simply reflected that the money would go to the informer.  How would she or he have known    Oh okay, okay.    Okay thank you.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Hm.    So General Mphego requested FM41?    To give him the money that he would use to pay for the shortfall?    Yes.  And – and why was he asking FM41 for that money?    Was FM41 – FM41 was – was not in charge of the account of the Secret Service Account because it was General Lazarus who was in charge of that is it not?    Oh so FM41 was in charge of an office which was – which used to process some of the claims?    I am sorry just repeat that.  What would they do to generate cash?    Oh.    Oh so they would put in effectively fake intelligence reports?    And – on the basis of those reports they or certain people would be thought to be entitled to certain payments.    In terms of rewards.    And that is what General Mphego was asking for?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Okay alright thank you.  Continue.    Who was that now?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   FM41?    Okay and who had asked for more money there?  Was it General Mphego again?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.    Okay.  Now I see that in your statements quite a number of these matters you deal with are not reflected in terms of when they happened.  Do you have no recollection as to when these events and incidents took place?    Yes.  Okay.  Yes continue.  Or Ms Wentzel do you want to take it from there?    Before you proceed.  You say that he was not disciplined?    Do you know enough about the facts to be able to say whether this was a matter where he should have been disciplined?  Do you know whether the fraud related incident to which you - you talk in your statement related to work or was it something that happened outside of work?    Yes.  If it was something that did not - that was not work related.  For example if he - but you - you also do not know what actually he is alleged to have done?    That is said to be fraud related?    Of course if he was convicted of fraud one would expect that he would not be allowed to continue in - in the police - in the police force.    But whether or not he was convicted of fraud is that something you know for sure or is that something that you heard from somebody saying he was convicted of fraud but you do not know forsure?  What is the position?    So - so you know that he - he was convicted of a car    And - and do you know that - do you know whether that car related offence was fraud?    Yes, but my question is whether you know whether the car related offence - whether you know whether the car related offence of which he was convicted was fraud.    Yes.  Ms Wentzel I think some of these things should    By the legal team …    And the investigators.    Ja, because …    You know if people have been involved in wrongdoing by all means people who have got personal knowledge of that must give evidence and - and say that is so when they know - they - they knowthe facts you know but this is a forum where you know the public is listening. The proceedings go on television and radio and people’s names are mentioned.  It is important that before names are mentioned things be checked …    Properly because …    Nobody - we - we should never do anything to anybody that we would not like to be done to us.  If people have got information, they know the facts.  By all means - but we you know the legal team and the investigators must just be careful that before a witness takes the stand you know. Somebody has checked properly and advised the - the witness about certain things you know.  You need to be careful aboutthat.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Hm, hm.  Ja.Okay.You understand my concern Colonel Naidoo?    Yes.  So - so where - where we are not sure let us stay away from making statements that could unfairly tarnish people’s names when we do not have the facts or we are not sure.  Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and - and your statement has got quite a lot of information where you have personal knowledge.  You already have testified over - I mean yesterday and on Friday there are lots of events where you have personal knowledge and that is - that is appreciated.  It is just that unfortunately there have been other areas where that has not been the case.    Yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And that - and that - that conviction is something you know about?    Yes.  Thank you.  Yes.  Continue.    Yes.    Yes.    Well I am sorry Ms Wentzel are you skipping paragraph 86?  That seems important or has it been covered?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm, yes.    And they did not have it?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So are you saying that Company X which was providing a lot of services to Crime Intelligence had …    Had as its directors had some of the people at Crime Intelligence as its directors?    And you name in particular General Lazarus and Colonel Barnard.  Is that right?    And you - you know this for sure?    Yes.    Oh, okay.  No now I - now I understand.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   So it was - it was in effect a parastatal?    Yes.    Ja.  They - they …    Had to be directors?    Ja, okay.  No.  Then - then I understand.  So it was not a private company?    And there were no directors involved in it who werenot part of Crime Intelligence?  Where there?    All the directors were part of Crime Intelligence?    Okay.  Then I understand.  Okay.    And these were - there were some of the seven members of the Mdluli family?    These were - ja, these were two of the seven?    That you were handling?    Yes.  As there handler were you not supposed to know what work they were doing in terms of their daily activities - work activities.    Or was that the role of their commander if there was a commander?  I heard you refer to a commander for some of the    Yes.    So ordinarily a handler should know what on a daily basis the agents they are handling are doing?    Yes, but you say in this case you handled the administrative side of things only and that not the operational side?    And you did not - you do not know who was handling the operational side?    (Intervenes).    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    What was the amount you gave?    Over what period?    Is that related to all the people that you have given evidence about who were either family members or friends of General Mdluli or General Lazarus and Marimuthu and I think one otherperson - Colonel Barnard - or does that relate simply to those agents who were family members of General Mdluli and/or his friends?    Yes.  Now from when they were appointed which was sometime in 2010 you said.  Is that right?    Was that towards the end of the year?    The first part of the year?    Hm.    To when you left which was when you went into the witness program which was October 2011.  Is that right?    So that is about a year and a half?    So you say that what Crime Intelligence must have spent on them must have been in the region of R5 million?    Do you include in that amount the salaries paid tothem and whatever other claims they may have made?    What is your recollection of what they were paid in terms of their basic salary per month more or - average …    The seven?    Yes.    But what would be your estimate of what the – what Crime Intelligence spent on their gross remuneration per month more or less when they started in 2010, if you take all the seven, do you have some idea, I accept that it will not be the exact amount but some estimate, do you know whether all seven put together may have been earning something in the region of R300 000 per month in terms of what Crime Intelligence was paying to them, collectively per month in 2010?    Yes, would you be able to say bearing in mind thedifferent levels at which different members of the seven were appointed and you have just mentioned some of the levels.    And bearing in mind that some were at much lower levels, would you be able to indicate what the minimum must have been in terms of the gross remuneration that Crime Intelligence was paying to them, for example could it have been a minimum of – when I say gross I mean before tax.    Could it have been less than R200 000 per month?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   It would have been more than R200 000 a month?    Yes.   So of course if assuming R200 000 would be the bare minimum.    Then over ten months, I mean over five months that would be a million and then over ten months that would be two million, if you are looking at about one and a half years, so you could be looking – your estimate of five million might not be too far from the amount?    Yes.    Yes, so five million might be conservative.    It is a fair reflection.    Okay thank you.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL     Well before that isn’t General – isn’t General Sibiya the one who is head of the Hawks now.      Yes      Aren’t we talking about much earlier, when probably somebody else would have been head of the Hawks, maybe Dramat,maybe somebody else, Colonel Naidoo?      Oh okay so when he was appointed to make these      Yes okay.      Deputy National Commissioner okay, thank you.      Yes I think it would be important to make reference to the position he held at the time.      Yes okay, yes Colonel Naidoo I think you wanted to say something?      Yes.      Was General Sibiya’s – General Sibiya’s wife employed within of Crime Intelligence?      Or were they – you understood the discussion where they contemplated recruiting her or simply placing false information about her within Crime Intelligence, as you understood their conversation what were they talking about doing?      Placing her name on the list meant what?      But I understood you to say she was not employed within Crime Intelligence, were they contemplating recruiting her, were they contemplating just falsely putting her name as if she had beenappointed to one of those 250 posts?      Oh okay, I thought you denied that when I raised it earlier on.     That they were trying to falsely create the impression that she was appointed, so that is what you understood the conversation to be about?      But it – I would have thought that it would be easy for General Sibiya to know that, that was just false information becausehe would know if his wife was appointed or was employed by Crime Intelligence?      Yes, just seems a weak kind of excuse to try and blackmail him, yes okay continue.      Yes.      Yes.      I’m sorry Colonel Naidoo and Miss Wentzel are we now under H at page 24?      Okay, I’m sorry. Can I just go back to paragraph 96 – 98 rather, you mentioned there, Colonel Naidoo that General Sibiyawas appointed to investigate various – to appoint these 250 appointments and promotions around the time that the promotions and appointments were made but you don’t take it further to tell me, what was the outcome of that process?      Did it happen just before you went onto the witness protection programme?    Yes, by the time you went into the witness protection programme you didn’t know – there was no outcome as far as you knew?    And if there was an outcome were you likely to be oneof the people who would have known?    Yes.    Yes but if there was an outcome already by the time you were put on the witness protection programme that outcome had not at that stage been implemented in any way if it’s implementationwould have meant the cancellation of appointments and promotions that had happened, is that right?    So by the time you went into the witness protection programme, the people who had been appointed and promoted to those positions were still continuing?    Okay alright, yes then I’m sorry I interrupted you, you had been asked a question that falls under H and you can continue.    Yes maybe we can take the adjournment.    Ja you can start with that question when we come back.  We’ll take the tea adjournment and resume at half past eleven,we adjourn.    Sorry we are starting 7 minutes late.  You know there is urgent commission matters that need to be attended sometimes cause us some delays.  Yes let us continue.      Are you there?    Well Ms Wentzel there was a question that you had asked that Colonel Naidoo was in the middle of answering when I interrupted him.    I do not think he had given his full answer.    Is this the same question?    Oh okay alright.  I thought it was more – I thought it related to somewhere around paragraphs 100 101 but you probably know better which paragraphs it related to.    Yes.    Yes okay.    When you say receipts you mean a document that would on the face of it reflect that the informer has received a certain amount?    As opposed to claims – signing claims?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So – so the informer would also know that he was – he was representing that he had received money that was yet to befilled in?    The informer would also have known that he was representing that he had received something that was yet to be filled in on the paper in terms of the amount?    Not reflecting any amount?    Yes.  Was it just the informer’s signature without any writing to the effect that something like “I acknowledge that I have received – amount from so and so”.  It was not anything like that – they just signed, put their signatures on a blank paper that did not say what it was – what the signature was for?    Okay.    Yes but in the case of the six receipts that you have told me about was the informer as far as you knew a legitimate informer or was the informer not a legitimate informer?  I am going back to thequestion as to why you were saying so called informer.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    So are you saying that what the informer was supposed to get was R500 000.00?    R500.00?    Okay.    So R500.00 being the value of the metal?    But you say that this was inflated – the value?    So was it represented that the value of the metal that    And based on that the reward – the informer reward – the informer reward was then calculated on the basis that the value of the metal was R5 – that had been recovered was R5 million.    And what was the amount of the informer reward that was decided upon?    Yes okay.  Thank you.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   So would they – would – would they go to for example Pretoria Magistrates Court I am just making an example and establish the case numbers relating to certain criminal cases and choose which criminal cases they would use and take the case numbers and then use information that can be established that anyone who wants to investigate would find in the docket and then attribute a role to an informer in regard to that investigation for that case in circumstances where the informer had not played any role in that case or would the case be that the informer would have played some role but his or herrole would be exaggerated in terms of the value of what was recovered?    Yes.    Yes.  But – so is the position therefore that they would go to a particular court, get information relating to existing cases or finalised cases and if they think that those cases have got information or fissures that they can use for – to get informer rewards then they would represent in one form or another that there had been an informer who had played a role when in fact there no informer hadplayed a role or that informer had not played any role.    And then they would then use that to – to get informer rewards?    And the rewards would not go to the informer but would go to them ultimately?    Yes okay thank you.    The claims.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes that is fine.    Yes.    Yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Blacking it out on the ticket.    The ticket would be required when he was travelling is it not?    Yes.  But where was the blacking out or erasing of his name done?  On some register?  On – where was this done?    Yes.    Yes.    YesCOLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Oh this was after you had returned and you….    And the ticket was going to be kept as – as part of the record?    Yes.  Okay.    Now he was outside of Crime Intelligence was he?    And there would have been no reason for Crime    Because if he was going to – I think you said something about him and the – and General Mdluli’s flat in Gordons Bay that he was going to lease it or what?    Oh.  So – so his company was used by Crime Intelligence for purposes of Crime Intelligence leasing variousproperties as safe houses?    Okay.    Okay.    And what was the rent - the amount for rent?    Yes.    Hm.    Okay.    Yes.    And you personally handled these transactions?    (Intervenes).    The year would have been from 2010 at some - at some stage to 2011.  Are you able to indicate with more certainty?  Now we know the lease is here and therefore it should indicate when it was signed and that should help you to say it was from what month to what month.    Did that …?    Oh, okay.  Alright and that arrest of General Mdluli was it among other things connected with this issue or not really?    Yes.  Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Well the - Ms Wentzel the question should have been whether he knows who bought furniture for these houses.    So it should not …ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Lead.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    the 50 or R60 000,00 would that be in regard to eachof the two properties or would it be for both?    Okay.    Was this property also supposed to be a safe house?    But you - are you saying that it was not used as a safe house?    And if he was the only one using it - it could not be a    Okay.  So on the records of Crime Intelligence it was reflected as a safe house?    And what you do know is that only General Mdluli used it out of the Crime Intelligence personnel?    Yes.  Would - would somebody at his level as far as you know be involved in using a safe house for any legitimate Crime Intelligence work?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    I am - I am sorry.  Let me just say but this house it was not the property of General Mdluli that was used by CrimeIntelligence as a safe house?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    I am sorry.  Are we now on page 30?    Is that General Lala’s flat?    Which one are we talking about now?ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Oh that still relates to that property at Clearwater Estate?    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.    Yes.  Do you know whether there was a - a policy applicable at Crime Intelligence saying whether or not people employed within Crime Intelligence could provide safe houses to Crime Intelligence - could have a lease with Crime Intelligence - could have leases with Crime Intelligence?Do you - do you know whether there was any policy or any prescript that was applicable which prohibited this?    Yes.    Yes, but are you able to say whether or not the manner in which these leases were handled were a safe house belonged to somebody within Crime Intelligence.  Are you able to say that the manner in which they were handled was not transpired even within the context of Crime Intelligence where a lot is not supposed to be transparent?    I am sorry.  Just repeat that.    Now were there other safe houses which Crime Intelligence leased which were dealt with differently from the way that leases of safe house owned by personnel from within Crime Intelligence were dealt with?    Okay.  Let me put the question differently.  Was the role played by Daez Trading confined as which as you say purported to be the owner of the premises.  Was it limited to those safe houses which belonged to General Lala and General Mdluli and General Lazarus and you must just tell me if I am putting somebody’s name into this that was not involved?    Yes, but you - you said that the role played by Daez Trading ensure that the true owners of the safe houses of General Mdluli and General Lala and General Lazarus was concealed.  Their - their identity - their identities were concealed …    By virtue of the fact that Daez Trading was reflected as the owner or lessor in regard to these lease houses.    Is that something you know as a matter of fact?    No, no you cannot know it as a matter of fact if you assume.    Is that something you know as a - as a matter of fact that there were other safe houses which were leased by Crime Intelligence where the owner of the safe house would be known.  The identity of the owner of the safe house would be known because there would be - because Daez Trading would not be - have any role or therewould be no other company playing a similar role in that lease.    Ja.  Maybe …    Maybe I am confusing you.    Ja.  No, no.    Okay.  I am - I am grateful for that because I was not sure and I did not say earlier do please do tell me if I am putting somebody’s name into something where he might not have been involved.    So are you suggesting that there was anything wrong with the leasing of their properties in the manner in which it was done    Yes.    Yes, but you see and of course you know this much better than I do, we are dealing with Crime Intelligence where one understands if there isn’t much transparency about many things, youunderstand that?    Now why is it not possible that the involvement of Daez Trading might be legitimate insofar as it would ensure that maybe anybody from outside Crime Intelligence who looks at the, who becomes aware of the lease should not know that this was a safe house or something like that?  Or let me put it differently do you know of any safe house that was leased by Crime Intelligence without the involvement of any company or Daez Trading?    Do you know whether – do you know whether the position is not that all safe houses that were leased by Crime Intelligence involved Daez Trading?    Yes.    Yes, but did you know any safe houses at all that were leased by Crime Intelligence other than these ones?  I will ask the question again, do you know of any safe houses that were leased by Crime Intelligence other than the ones you have just mentioned that were owned by General Mdluli, General Lalla and the one at Clear – isit Clearwater?    Well let’s start with even if they involve Daez Trading are there any other safe houses that you knew or you know that other than these ones that you have mentioned?    There were many others?    Did they all involve Daez Trading?    There were some which did not involve Daez Trading?    Yes, are you able to give me a rough estimate of the total number of safe houses that you might have been aware of at the time you joined the witness protection programme, just roughly are we talking about 20 are we talking about 15 more or less?    It doesn’t have to be exact I just want to have an idea.    Yes.    Ten per province.    Okay that takes us to something in the region of 100 safe houses, is that right?    And out of these safe houses about how many would you say had Daez Trading as – reflected as the owner of the safehouses?    Okay, alright now the other ones did you know whether there was some other company that played the same role in regard to them as Daez Trading had played in regard to the four or five or did you know that there was no such company which played a similar role?    Yes okay so there may have been, there might not have been?    Okay I’m trying to establish what features one would look for, for a lease of a safe house by Crime Intelligence where this was legitimate there was nothing irregular.  Whether the mere presence of a company would indicate that it’s irregular or you could have a list with a company playing the role that Daez Trading was playing but still that list being regular.    It is possible?    Okay so if we then come back to these houses thatyou have talked about that belonged to General Mdluli and General Lalla, what makes you say, in this particular case in regard to these particular safe houses, this was irregular?    Now, so it’s the manner in which payments were made – payments of the rent were made that makes you conclude that these leases were irregular?    And in regard to leases of safe houses that would have been regular, do you know what the process would have been, they – would payments have been done through EFT or is there something you know?    When you say by cash so the mere fact that the rent is paid in cash wouldn’t, on it’s own suggest anything irregular?    So the records of Crime Intelligence, if one were to – let’s assume that one would have to have access to the records, are you saying that the records will not reveal that in regard to this specific safe houses General Mdluli was the owner of, is it one or two flats – properties and General Lalla was the owner in regard to another?    Yes, but you say in regard to other lease houses when everything is regular, one should be able to find records of the true owner?    Okay alright, thank you.    Yes, so ultimately the rent was supposed be how much and it got inflated by R2 000 to be how much?    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes is that the R2 000?    Yes.    Yes, okay so it was split between the two of you?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   1000/1000?    Yes okay it would be settled by making use of the rent or separately?    Oh okay alright.    The R2 000?    Okay.    Okay.    On his behalf?    Was the split on a 50/50 basis or?    Yes okay.    Yes okay, Miss Wentzel?    Yes did you know whether they were being rented as safe houses or they were being rented for other purposes?     Okay and do you know how many properties were being rented by Mr Marimuthu?    And do you know where they were located or at least some of them?    Yes.    Yes.    When you visited these two premises in KZN and you found that they were not suitable for use at that stage, do you know whether Mr Marimuthu was already being paid rent for them or not really, or whether that was before any leases cold be signed?    Yes and do you remember more or less when it must have been when you took – undertook this visit to those houses?    Okay was it one visit when you – one trip when you visited both or was it different trips?    One trip okay alright.    Yes.    You said there was something that was not working, what was that?    Oh Okay.    Okay, alright, yes continue.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Did he say he wanted you to do this?    I think it’s one o’ clock we should take the lunchadjournment, we’ll adjourn and we will resume at two o’ clock, we adjourn.    Okay let us continue.    Yes.    Yes I – I think that when you know some – that something was done such as the installation of the cameras but you do not know the reason for it to – the motive behind it you should leave it just at that.  To say you do not know why it was done.  You may have your assumptions and speculations but you actually do not know but it was done.    Yes Okay.    Yes.  Please describe the facility was – was it – how many apartments – how many rooms and so on?  Tell me more aboutthe fissures of the facility?    Hm.    Yes made of wood?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.  So your estimate of how many – maybe I should ask you about how many people or houses or families could it accommodate?    At a time?    At an official level what was it for?  What was it    Did you use it on a number of occasions?    Yes.    And you say you had a manager?    You called him – I say him it can be her.  Camp    Okay.  And was that somebody who was therepermanently?    On a full time basis?    And were there other employees employed in the facility?    Yes.  And when it was not being used what would they    You do not know.  And they were being paid by Crime Intelligence?    And the only time – the only times when you have seen it being used it was being used by personnel from Crime Intelligence for basically holidays?    Or weekends away.    Ja.    Yes and this property was not leased but it belonged to Crime Intelligence?    It belonged to the state?    But was being used by Crime Intelligence?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Okay alright. Thank you.    Could it be that it is not the same person?  Is it not a question of terminology?    Yes you just – you are just not sure whether his position was referred to as Camp Commander or Camp Manager?    Okay alright.    Yes but you say that out of those that you attended only two were used for some work?    About how many times did you go to this facility if youare able to remember?    About …    In total yes.    Yes.  The other times you were with other members    But you say out of those seven or eight times that on which you went to – you used the facility only two – you are aware of only two occasions when people in the group – some people in the group used the visit for work purposes?    Yes but you say each time these visits to this facility happened on records they were reflected as official duties for operations?    Yes okay.    And – I am sorry.  Who would have – who would have been responsible for having these visits recorded as official?    So each person had to fill in forms or whatever to say he or she was going on an official duty?    Yes.    Yes.    They would not have recorded that?    Okay alright.  Thank you.    How big was it?  A four – four bedrooms?    Yes.  How many times did you have occasion to use it?    A few times.    Hm.    Apart from yourself do you know who else used it?    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.  Continue.    Yes continue.    What did you understand him to be talking about when he said we can piggy back on this thing?    How would he use the hijacking as an excuse?  Would it be that he was scared of staying in his house because of the    Hm.  Or that is how you understood it.    Okay.    I am sorry you will refer to them as?    Hm.    Yes.    This terminology that furniture was ”bordered” what is that supposed to mean?   Yes.  But you say this was done to this furniture    Okay.  And when – what do you normally do or what did Crime Intelligence normally do with furniture that had legitimately reached a point where it should be “bordered”?    Ja.    Okay.    Yes.    So strictly speaking it is not correct to say you know – at least of one property because all you know is what FM08 told you?    We could or could not – which may or may not be true?    Yes.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Yes.    Yes okay.    Yes okay.    I am sorry before you – you proceed Colonel Naidoo.  Ms Wentzel the parts which he is skipping because he says he does not have personal knowledge of.  Those can be investigated further.    To establish if his understanding is correct and if need be he can come back or somebody else who has personal knowledge can come in or who may have grounds to believe certain    Okay.    And Colonel Naidoo you can assist in that process.  So in other words you might have information and you are not sure because you do not have personal knowledge but nevertheless what you have been told by other people might help in investigating those issues which might lead to establishing that what you knew or what you had been told is true.  You understand that?    Yes.  So where you can assist with regard to that I am sure you will assist?    Yes okay.  It just helps that by the time it is aired in    The necessary groundwork has been done to make sure that if it is aired in public there are reasonable grounds to believe it is true.    Okay.      Which property are you talking about?ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   That is the one he said he does not have personal knowledge.  That he said you wanted to skip or have you come across something that makes you think he might want to revisit that?    Yes.  Okay he may – he can clarify it.  Do you want to repeat your question?    Ja.    Okay.    So you were present when furniture was purchased for this property?    Yes but that is about all that you have personal knowledge of?    Okay.  But you – you do have suspicions that it might be property that was used as a safe house illegally or something to that effect?    Yes. COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU    Yes.    Yes.  So what you can say is that the furniture thatwas used – that was purchased to put into this property as it was nearing completion was furniture purchased with money from the Secret Service Account?    Yes okay.  I think that is important.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    So you people at Crime Intelligence like R40 000,00.    Ja.    Did he tell you why you had to deposit that amount in the account of Karin Hanekom Attorneys?    Yes.    Yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Hm.    So the deposit that you made was - you deposited a cheque signed by General Mdluli?  Where the amount had been filled in by General Lazarus?    And you deposited that cheque into the account of    That was - that cheque was for R30 000,00?    R40 000,00?    Okay.    Ja.    Oh.    General Mdluli had written the - the amount in - in figures?    And then he had not written the amount in words?    Oh, okay.  Okay.  So did you understand that this money was in relation to a property that General Mdluli was buying …    Or not really?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes, but why - why did General Lazarus have to be the one to fill in the amount in words?  Do you know?    If General Mdluli had already written the amount in figures.    Oh.  I thought that you said that General Mdluli had written the amount in words - in figures …    But had not written the amount in words?    General Lazarus was the one who wrote it in words?    Okay.  Which one is - which his which?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Now were you present when General Mdluli wrote the amount in words …?    In - in figures?    Ja and were you present when General Lazarus wrotethe amount in words?    But - so then when you spoke about the cheque being blank what were you talking about?    Yes.    Ja.  Is - is your recollection on this matter quite clear?    Yes.  I am asking that because I seem to think that you have gone from one version of saying the cheque was blank andthat General Lazarus wrote both the - both the amount in figures and the amount in words to a version that says General Mdluli wrote the amount in figure - in figures but General Lazarus wrote the amount in words.    I seem to think you have said that a few times.  Am wrong?    Did I misunderstand something?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   How - how do you know that the amount in figures was written by General Mdluli when you were not there when he - whoever wrote the amount wrote it?    Yes, but you see now you are saying you are    Yes.    Yes, but you remember a while ago I said please if you are not sure if you assume do not tell me.  Just tell me what you know and you will remember I - I asked you is your memory quite clear    Yes.    You - you are not sure …    As to who wrote the amount in figures?    Yes.    Okay, alright.    What page is it?  1-1-6?    Did you fill in that deposit slip?    Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.    I am going to come back to - and ask you to repeat this discussion that you had with General Mdluli but I just want to go back to the deposit slip at page 1-1-6.    You know the paragraph which deals with this is paragraph 1-6-3.  The deposit into the account of Karin Hanekom Attorneys and that paragraph has got two - at least two amounts.  The amount of R40 000,00 and the amount of R30 000,00.    Now I understood you earlier on and you must just tell me if I misunderstood you to say that the amount that you deposit into the account of the attorneys - Karin Hanekom Attorneys - was    Now this cheque here there is a reference to R30 000,00 two times and then there is R40 000,00.  What can you say to me to try and clarify?    Not R40 000,00?    But do you recall that when I asked you said it was R40 000,00 or did I misunderstand you?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Okay, alright.  So the R70 000,00 was made up of two amounts.  There was R30 000,00 which was an advance for - that you took in your name?    Which was cash?    And then there was R40 000,00.    In the form of a cheque …  And that cheque being the cheque from General Mdluli?    Okay.  So - so you deposited in the end an amount of R70 000,00?    Okay, thank you.  You can proceed.    Yes.  I would like him to repeat that.    So money was - money was taken from where and put where?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Yes, okay.  So - so - and the effect of that was that in the end the money that had been paid the R30 000,00 that you had taken as an advance payment for - for his benefit was repaid?    Yes, okay.  Alright and this was - the deposit was made on 25 May 2010?    Hm.  Okay.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Okay, alright.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   As - as I said in regard to - in the context of the other part which you skipped they can still be investigated further …    To establish whether it is indeed what happened and if it is then either you or somebody else can come and give evidence about those aspects.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Was this money that he was just like giving to you to spend for this purpose with nothing for him - in it for him?    Why would he sort it out with him?    Yes.  Oh, after some investigation.    Okay.  No that is fine.  I mean we - in a Commission one - we allow hearsay but there has got to be some limit and where things can be investigated first they should be investigated first as far as possible.  Okay.    And you had not asked for this.  He just came up with the idea?    Yes and - but what was your understanding of whose money you were going to use for - for this purpose - purpose?  Was your understanding that he was giving you or maybe let me ask first you said it was a cheque?  Was it his cheque?    Yes.  Did you have an understanding of what hemeant when he said he would sort it out with Deena?    Your own understanding of what he meant?    Or are you not sure?    Yes.    But you - you are not able to think of any reason why without you having asked him he would give you R20 000,00 from his own pocket to improve your property?    R20 000,00?    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    Yes.  Okay.  Thank you and - and we do not have a copy of that cheque here.  Do we?    Colonel Naidoo …    In - in the bundle?    Oh, okay.    It is not here?    Okay, alright.  Do you have a recollection of roundabout when this was when he gave you this cheque?    Okay.  Alright.  Yes continue.    Yes.    Okay.    Let - let me first understanding from - from where he skips to where.  So you would be skipping from page - paragraph 1-6-8 …    Up to 170?    Okay.  Thank you and from 171 you are ready to deal with that?    Or from 1-7-2?    (Indistinct).  Those are the paragraphs you are skipping?    Okay, thank you.  So it means we go to …    SR Vehicles.  Okay.  Take it from there.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Huh-uh.  Yes.    Yes.    To the persons that are mentioned in – to the persons mentioned who are part of the list of seven?    From the Mdluli family that you were handling?    Yes, okay, so you delivered the vehicles to each one of them, their one.    Whatever the place was where you were asked to deliver it?    Okay.      And did you make them sign any documents?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes, and you told them what was expected of them in terms of their use of the vehicles under Crime Intelligence.    Okay.    Yes.    I’m sorry let us go back to the first one, the Audi 27 are you able to indicate during which period he used that vehicle?    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Did he – you did say that he didn’t use all of these seven vehicles at the same time.    Are you able to say whether at any one time he would have had a minimum of X number of vehicles that he used, or is that something you are not able to say.    Yes, okay, alright.   Continue you were onto 177.2.    That’s the Mercedes Benz E350 CTI?    Alright.    Yes, continue, ja.    Yes.    Yes.    It was purchased by Company X?    Using the Secret Service Account?    Yes.    Yes.    The price?    Yes.    Mmm.    Okay and actually all these vehicles were purchased using the funds from that account, other than the first one which you said was the Audi Q7.    Which was purchased through the Open Account    Okay, alright, yes, continue.    Yes.    Yes.    So did the availability of all these vehicles to him mean that he could leave his official car and use any one of those vehicles that were available to him as he saw fit?    What are the chances that there could be somebody else or other people use them and you would not have been aware of it?    Okay.    If anyone else used them and in the process of doing so had to put in petrol and one – oh and had to put in petrol ...    Excuse me.    If anybody used any one or more of the vehicles at any stage other than General Mdluli and did put in petrol would you have been the only person to whom they would have had to submit petrol slips or could they submit them to somebody else?    Okay.    Okay, let us continue.    I’m trying.    Let us try and see how far we can go.    Yes.    Maybe I might – maybe we should take a shortadjournment, I could arrange for some prescription, further prescription from the doctor before they leave.   Let’s take ten minutes, we will resume at twenty past three.  We will adjourn.    Okay let us proceed.    Which year was that?    Okay alright.  Yes the price was R373 850.00.  R373 850.00.    Yes.    FM?    Yes okay.    Yes.  Was this a vehicle that was purchased with money or funds from the Secret Service Account?    Yes.  Were all purchases of goods or were all payments made by Company X from the Secret Service Account or were there some payments that were made by Company X from the open account?    Yes. And in regard to this one you are sure about that    Yes.  Okay.  So arrangements – General Mdluli gave instructions that arrangements should be made to – for the vehicle to be fetched from Minister Mthethwa’s residence in Pretoria?    When the vehicle was delivered for the first time were you part of that?    Oh. Yes okay.  So when it was to be fetched you also went to the Minister’s residence together with MF11?    And this time he knew the way to get there/    Yes.  Okay continue.    Initially it was – you said it was registered in the name of FM11 is it not?    Was that registration changed afterwards?    Are you able to say for how long the vehicle was with Minister Mthethwa?    Yes.  Okay.  Now vehicles that are bought by National Crime Intelligence do they – does Crime Intelligence ever buy vehicles for Ministers – for Minister of Police? I take it that he was Minister of Police at the time?    You do not know?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Okay alright.  Yes.  And in terms of you have no recollection also in terms of kilometres that it would have travelled during the time that it was with him when it was returned?    Yes.    Yes.  Did you have any understanding of the context for the statement that according to General Mdluli the Minister did not want to continue using the car because journalists were following him?  Do you have – did you have any understand what that was about?  Why    Yes. Okay.    Who was saying that and saying to whom or in relation to whom?    And who is Solly now?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Oh was Solly General Lazarus’ name?    Or nickname?    Solomon.  Okay alright.    Yes okay continue.    Yes.    Yes.    So it was brand new?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Hm.    Yes.    On the driveway.  Yes.    Hm.    You left the vehicle where it was parked?    Ja. Okay.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   On whose name?    Oh so it was registered in her personal – as her personal car?    Yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.  Can I take you back to paragraph 182?  There you say that General Lazarus informed you that General Mdluli had suggested that you purchase or I guess CI purchase a vehicle for General Nchwe?    As there was bad blood between her and General Lazarus.  Why would bad blood between General Nchwe and General Lazarus be the reason for her to be bought a car by Crime Intelligence?    Yes.    Oh you informed General Lazarus that General Mdluli had suggested that you purchase a vehicle for General Nchwe?    Did you say anything along the lines to – that is now to General Lazarus that there was bad blood between General Mdluli and General Nchwe?    Are you going to stay away from it in relation to – in relation to what this related to or even whether this was said you arenot sure about – about it?    The reason.  You will stay away from the reason or motive for buying the car?    Okay.  But apart from what you may have been told by General Mdluli are you able to enlighten me on why General Mdluli orCrime Intelligence had to buy General Nchwe a motor vehicle when she was not part of Crime Intelligence?  Or is that something you know nothing about?    On what you are not sure about?    Yes okay.    Okay no that is fine.    Okay that is fine.  Yes Ms Wentzel.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   I am sorry I am trying to look at your affidavit to see where you – oh this is 184 where you say the vehicle was – saidGeneral Lazarus then arranged for the purchasing of a white Audi Q5 3.0 TDI.  Is that right?    And that is the vehicle that was purchased?    And – but you say in the asset register of Crime Intelligence the position was misrepresented?    Yes and what was the reason for that?  You say not to attract attention?    You would not have been entitled to a car of that value?    Yes.  And whose idea was it that the true – the nature of the car be misrepresented?    Yes with your approval – with your knowledge?    Yes.    Procurement.    Was he Head of Procurement?    Yes.  And he also knew where the vehicle was?  Who would be using the vehicle?    You are not sure about that?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.  Okay.  And did he know that there was misrepresentation or he truly believed that the vehicle the one that was written on the asset register?    Oh okay.  Okay.  So – so the – you – you talked earlier on about General Nchwe giving you her ID and utility bill.  Was that because at the Department of Transport the vehicle was to beregistered in her name?    But on the asset register at Crime Intelligence it would be reflected differently?    Okay.  What was going to happen in terms of this arrangement to petrol slips and so on?  Because if a car is under the – under Crime Intelligence and is used – being used for the operations of Crime Intelligence one would expect that there would be petrol slips that would be brought in from time to time.  Did this happen in regard to this car even though it was being used by General Nchwe?    And of course if they came would anything written in them betray the lie that was to be found in the asset register?  In other words would the petrol slip reflect that it is a different car – a much …    Or would they not?    Yes.    Yes.    Oh so all the places where information needed to be changed in order to accord with the misrepresentations had beenchanged?    Yes.    It will remain like that Ja.    Yes.  Okay alright.  So – but if there were no petrol slips anybody investigating would have found it strange that there were no petrol slips for a long period of time in regard to a vehicle that was supposed to be used?    And also I take it that if it was a vehicle under National – under Crime Intelligence one would expect that whenever it had to be serviced the relevant documentation would have had to be put into the records of Crime Intelligence, is that right?    And in this case there would be – there certainly would be no records of any such documents at Crime Intelligence for    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and normally you would be the person who would know if there were documents suggesting that it was taken for a service under Crime Intelligence?    Yes okay.      Yes.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Yes, okay.    Hm.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   That was …    That was delivering an iPad to General Nchwe?    We did not do this earlier Ms Wentzel but we should - you should do it to assist the transcribers.  Otherwise when we read the transcript you do not know what they are talking about if you look at what they have written when they rely on what - on the pronunciation ofNchwe.  Nchwe is N-C-H-W-E.  Yes, continue.    We are at 4 o’ clock now but we can still continue.  Is that fine with you Colonel Naidoo?    Ja.  Let us - let us continue and see how far we are at half past four.    We - we might have to go to five but let us see.    The affidavit.    Yes.    It requires further investigation?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Yes.  No that is fine.  Let us - well earlier on I said Ithink 10 minutes.  I ended up taking more.  Let us rather come back at quarter four.  Is that alright?    Just to give more time.  So that whatever needs to be done can be done.  Okay.  We - we will adjourn and …    And return at quarter past four.  We adjourn.    Okay let us continue.    Are you back Colonel Naidoo.    Oh, so maybe we should not continue for too long.    Oh, okay.  I have a hearing that is supposed to start at nine tomorrow in regard to some application and I wanted to finish this first before I get to that, but if you are no longer comfortable we cannot continue.  It is okay, what we will do is I will deal with theapplication tomorrow at nine and then when we are done with that then we will need to continue with Colonel Naidoo and finish.    Whatever else was planned for tomorrow will have to wait until we have finished with Colonel Naidoo after that application,so nine o’clock would be that application, as soon as we have finished with that application it will be Colonel Naidoo which I will go up to when we’re finished then we will follow whatever else was planned for tomorrow, so I think you will need to – I think share information with the evidence leader who was going to lead whichever witness was going to be for tomorrow, but I am sure they will talk to me as well.    Ja, ja, ja.    Okay we will stop at this stage then to take into account Colonel Naidoo’s situation and then we will continue tomorrow after the application that I will hear at nine o’clock.We adjourn. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Good morning Chair.    Yes Chair…    Yes Chair.  Chair the reason for the delay is that as you noticed yesterday in the testimony difficulties arose from the fact that Colonel Naidoo’s affidavit was not deposed to likeRoelofse – Colonel Roelofse’s was in a redacted form.  It was deposed to and only afterwards redacted.  The result has been that the relationship with certain of the persons of Crime Intelligence have been redacted and in – of in many, many instances the sentences no longer make sense.  There were also issues that arose during the course of consultations with Colonel Naidoo on Sunday where it appeared that certain of the FM numbers were wrong and they needed to be corrected.  He has deposed to a supplementary affidavit to deal with all of these issues and the Secretariat is in the process of I believe preparing a bundle and the amended pages.  They just need a little bitmore time to get this into our files.    Um…    Yes.    Yes that is very much appreciated Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Chair as I indicated earlier this morning Colonel Naidoo has deposed to a supplementary affidavitwhich has been marked Exhibit KK1.2 and will follow after his what I call main affidavit or his witness statement.  I think it has been handed to your Registrar if it could just be admitted as an exhibit and placed in your file?    I did not because I was being given an instruction I am afraid – I am sorry.    Yes it is where we want it.  Thank you very much Chair.  I will make sure that the Secretariat who has been here in court attends to the fact that sometimes a signature goes over a paginated page and it – and in other instances where it is an annexure I had also found it difficult to read what the page number is and we will    Chair before I continue with the remainder of Colonel Naidoo’s evidence I said that I would do a reconciliation overnight to work out the percentage spent on the two credit cards.  Chair that exercise has been done and in respect of Colonel Naidoo’s credit card 99.99% was spent.  In respect of Colonel Barnard’s credit card 83.49% was spent.  So the assessment that well over 80% was spent was correct and…    Thank you Chair.  Chair yesterday we weredealing with the family members who were appointed as agents into Crime Intelligence – into the agent program at Crime Intelligence and before the adjournment we were dealing with the family members of Colonel Barnard.  It is at page 19 of the statement paragraph 73.  Colonel Naidoo…    Yes.    Yes.    Page 19.    Yes.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Yes I think that that is…    Yes.    Yes.    We will make every effort to do so.    And Chair certain aspects you will see will go    Before I start Chair if perhaps I can get Colonel Naidoo just to confirm that the affidavit that has been placed into evidence as Exhibit K1.2 is his affidavit and that he has signed that affidavit before a commissioner this morning?    Yes.  Yes.    1.1    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I understand.    Colonel Naidoo the affidavit that appears at page 141 and ends at page 154 with your signature page 153 is that    And you confirm…    I think both of you…    Yes.  And Chair amendments have made to the affidavit so that it makes grammatical sense and correct certain errors.  Colonel Naidoo are you satisfied that the amendments made are correct?    Thank you.  Now Colonel Naidoo we are goingto proceed dealing with the family members of Colonel Barnard on page 19 of your affidavit paragraph 73.    If you could just indicate to the Chair who those family members were?    And then with regard to Major Els – Major-General Els was the National Head of Crime Intelligence Gathering at that stage Chair.  Two of his family members were appointed to positions within CI.  One or both of those names I do not know but I know that one was appointed as a Lieutenant Colonel without any prior appointment in SAPS and another was appointed as a Captain without any prior appointment in the SAPS.  And I think as far as I know that particular individual left the police or resigned from the police.    Then Colonel Naidoo with regard to former Lieutenant General Lala?    Could you then deal with the appointment of    Colonel Naidoo can you deal with that relationship?    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Colonel Naidoo could you deal with that relationship which you deal with in paragraph 81 of your statement?    Yes.  Colonel Naidoo what do you believe is the significance of this relationship between FM41 and General Lala and General Mphego?    Legal team, yes.    Yes.  I can - I can see this.    I appreciate it.    Yes I …    I appreciate that.    I - I appreciate it Chair.  I think that it is - it is absolutely correct.    That …    During the course of the evidence …    Things that were - were taken as fact have    And that is a very serious difficulty and …    I - I have - have spoken to Colonel Naidoo about confirming …    Only things that he actually knows about.    Not matters that he does not know about.    So if he knows that that is true.    There is no difficulty with testifying as to that …    Then he should not testify to that.    Thank you Colonel Naidoo.  Colonel Naidoo could you then deal with the appointment of FM42 and FM44 as informants?    Colonel Naidoo if we can now deal with what activities the - I am going to loosely refer to as the Mdluli agents were involved in.  You will see in paragraph 87 …    Yes.  It - it will be covered and Chair I appreciate it.  I can see that is important …    I would like him to deal with it.    Colonel Naidoo could you please deal first with what your involvement was with the handling of agents?    And is it correct that FM25 and FM30 are also included who you are not sure if they are actually family members.  Is that right?    Can you now deal with what is stated in paragraph 88 with regard to FM24, FM29, FM25 and FM30?    And could you tell the Chair what happened    And what was their level of computer skills?    And could you then deal with FM26?    And did you deal with his petrol claims?    Where did his family reside?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Could you then deal with FM28 and FM27?    Colonel Naidoo who was the head of Company X?    And Colonel Barnard?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you please now deal with FM28 and FM27?    Colonel Naidoo you say in paragraph 95 page 23 of your statement that FM24, FM25, FM29 and FM28 received advances on their monthly salary.  Could you just deal with that?    So was this just a temporary measure?    Now having dealt with the expenditure of the Mdluli agents paying salaries, cellphones, hiring premises, setting up a front company, vehicles etcetera.  How much do you believe during theperiod that you were their handler was spent on these agents?      Yes you are correct it is reflected the current head.      Yes it’s correct, I misread      Yes.      Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo you’ve said that the submission of false informer rewards was a mechanismused to generate large amounts of cash within Crime Intelligence.      And if you could explain this in a little bit more detail now to the Chair and also provide the example you indicated earlier, you would deal with as to what happened in Colonel FM41’s office relating to this?      Yes we are.      Yes Chair it’s quarter past eleven I don’t know if you want to take the tea adjournment.      We will start that subject afterwards.    Colonel Naidoo before the…    Before the tea adjournment you were dealing with what is set out by you on – in paragraph 107 page 25 of your    Yes.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   He had not given his full answer.    Yes.    Yes but …    Colonel Naidoo if I am wrong you can – if youcould – you welcome to clarify.    Would you like to proceed with what you were saying?    Colonel Naidoo do you recall when and where this incident took place?    And why do you use the term so called informer?    Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo if you can just explain to you – explain a little bit more detail what you indicated a few minutes ago and – and if we can just go back so you can explain it so that we can properly understand.  Which office did Colonel FM41 work in?    And what position did FM45 hold in that team?    And now explain you said he informed you that Colonel 41 had a contact in Organised Crime and he devised the scheme using SAPS case numbers?    Could you just explain that in a little bit moredetail and in particular with regard to how the system for informer rewards worked?    So are you saying that instead of being paid –    Okay now if we go back to the system with the scheme using the SAPS case numbers.  Are you saying that as a result of a criminal prosecution under these case numbers there would have been a successful recovery which could be then used for informer rewards.  If you can just explain how it works in a little bit more detail please?    Colonel Naidoo is it correct that the reportpursuant to which informer rewards were claimed would be filled out by the informers’ handler not the informer himself?    No not the receipts.    You…    The claims – so what you said is that a SAPS case number would be used.  It would reflect that there had been a successful outcome.    And then a report is submitted alleging that they – the informer is worked on a successful investigation andtherefore is claiming informer rewards.    Who would fill that report out?    And you also indicate in your statement that Crime Intelligence would retain a personnel file on each informer and progress reports were maintained monthly in order to track the productivity of the informer.    And was that to determine if that informer wasentitled to informer rewards.    And as you understood the scheme where a report was submitted by a handler alleging that they had worked on a successful – the informer had worked on a successful investigation.  As you understood the scheme would the informer ever had worked on this investigation under this case number?    Thank you Colonel Naidoo.  Colonel Naidooyou say in your statement that there was an equal abuse of the systems in place at Crime Intelligence relating to the procurement and utilisation of safe houses. This is page 26 of your statement.    From paragraph 109.  Could you please give the Chair some background as the basis upon which you say this?    Yes.    Yes.    Now this is…    Colonel Naidoo this is safe house at Gordons Bay rented from General Mdluli.  Could you just detail what you know about that?    If you can just – Colonel Naidoo just to clarify erase his name from where?    And how did you do this?    Colonel Naidoo could you please have a look at the document that appears on page 104.      Now is this the lease agreement in respect of Mr – General Mdluli’s Gordons Bay property that you are referring to now?    And if you have a look at the first page 104 this is a lease agreement between Daez Trading CC as the lessor.    And then Telford Welveller and it looks like Rolebise.    Rolebile.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Could you please tell the Chair who that was?    And is it correct that Mr Mdluli was the registered owner of that property?  It was not Daez Trading.    Now do you have an idea what the period ofthe lease was and for what amount?  It appears in the lease itself.    Yes.    Now you have said that the lease was signed on behalf of Crime Intelligence.  Who was paid the rent for this property?    And if the rent was 8 500 and you got 7 000 what was - what happened to the difference?    Thank you.  So ultimately the bulk of the rental was received by General Mdluli?    Colonel Naidoo did you purchase furniture for the safe houses rented from General Lala and General Mdluli?    Yes.    Colonel Naidoo do you remember where you were when you witnessed the signing of this lease in respect ofGeneral Mdluli’s property?    I - I will tell you why I am - no there appears to be a confusion.  I - I will deal with this over the lunch adjournment.  I think that there has been a - an incorrect lease added after the end of that which is confusing.  Could you now deal with the furniture that was purchased for these properties?    Yes.  I - I apologise.    Yes.    I apologise.    Colonel Naidoo was furniture purchased for this properties and if so who purchased this furniture?    And do you know how much Crime Intelligence spent on these two properties in respect of furniture?    Colonel Naidoo could you now deal with the lease of residential property situated at Clearwater Estate in Boksburg.    Colonel Naidoo could you please have a look at the document on page 111 and then more particular at page 114.    Colonel Naidoo if you have regard to the    And then if you have regard to page 114 is it correct that you also witnesses this lease agreement?    And dated 10 November 2009?    Now it is also a lease conclude with Daez Trading and it you look at page 112 it is for a period of one year from 1 December 2009 to 30 November 2010 for 17 500 per month plus VAT.    Is that correct?    Now who was responsible for the furnishing of this safe house?    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    So we are dealing with paragraph 127 at the bottom of page 29 to the top of page 30.    Colonel Naidoo can you just detail what furniture you recall purchasing for this house …    And the value?    And you have any idea how much was spent?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   And Colonel Naidoo who was responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of this house?    Do you recall who you would see at the house - residing at the house during the time that you conducted this maintenance and dropped off groceries?    Thank you Colonel Naidoo.  Could you now deal with General Lala’s flat in Rondebosch Cape Town?      Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you please now deal with the Morgan Ridge property in Boksburg referred to on page 31 paragraph 137 and 138 of your witness statement?      So Colonel Naidoo if I’m understanding you correctly are you saying that in essence, this extra amount of R2 000 a month was held by Mr Joe Marx, then to be collected by General Lazarus at the end of the year?  So that R24 000 would accumulate and if he hadn’t taken an advance he could then go and say, okay now I’mcoming to fetch my R24 000?      Yes.      Now could you deal with what is called the property at X Business Park?      Thank you Colonel Naidoo, can you now deal with Mr Marimuthu’s premises?      And Colonel Naidoo do you remember where in KZN these properties were situated?      And do you remember why you felt they were      Colonel Naidoo could you then tell the Chair about a property that was rented by Crime Intelligence for FM18 and if you could explain who she was?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Naidoo.    Thank you.  Just before the lunch adjournment we were dealing with Mr Murimuthu’s premises.    If we could now deal with the Island Rock covert facility.  Could you please tell the Chair about this facility?    Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you now please just deal with the Island Rock facility?    Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo am I correct that this property is on a beach?    And did any of the suppliers to Crime Intelligence have access to this property?    Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you then please deal with the Thompson Bay property in Ballito?      Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Then Colonel Naidoo the Ballito Bay property who owned that property?    And was it leased as a safe house?    Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you deal with the property we have now called X Estates in Greenstone Johannesburg?    And…    After the – General Lazarus’ alterations werecompleted did he continue to remain in this house?    And what happened to the furniture that had been purchased for the house?    Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo could you please tell the Chair about the property owned by Colonel FM10?    Could you then deal with the payments to Karin Hanekom Attorneys?    Yes.    I will make sure that that is done.    Chair we before we proceed there in respect of this property Colonel Naidoo do you have personal knowledge of the furniture purchased for this property?    I think that this – there is an aspect that he does perhaps have personal knowledge and if he can just clarify that.    Yes.  Colonel Naidoo were you involved at all in the purchase of property – of furniture for this property?    And what do you mean by that?    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  In whose name was theadvance for the additional amount of 30 000 taken?    And who approved that advance?    And why was the advance taken in your name?    And if you have regard to page 116.    Is that the deposit slip that you are referring to?    116.    And after this were arrangements made to repay this advance of 30 000 that had been taken in your name toCrime Intelligence?    Chair Colonel Naidoo was dealing with how the arrangement that he sought to make to pay back the R30 000,00 that advance had been taken in his name at page …    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Thank you Chair.    It is not in the bundle.    No.    Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo you then deal with the acquisition of State vehicles.  As far as you are aware were the Generals in Crime Intelligence entitled to acquire State vehicles?    Who was responsible for acquiring …?    Page 40.CHAIRPERSON   Page 40 Chair.  Yes.    Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo who was responsible for the acquisition of State vehicles?    Colonel Naidoo this section of your statement is prefaced by a statement at paragraph 173 that you were shown documentation by Colonel Roelofse regarding State vehicles that were delivered to General Mdluli’s family members.    But you say you comment on them as follows.  Is that correct?    Now on whose instructions were these vehicles delivered to the Mdluli family members?    And who delivered these vehicles?     Thank you.      Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo if you could please then deal with General Mdluli’s vehicles, the vehicles he used      Who was responsible for the petrol claims in respect of these vehicles?      And Colonel Naidoo did you ever process petrol claims for any other person at Crime Intelligence in respect of these vehicles?  Did you hear me?      Did you ever process petrol claims by anybody else at Crime Intelligence in respect of these vehicles?      Thank you.      Are you okay?      I can see Chair.  If you indicate to us you are not feeling fine you will let us know.     Yes.      Colonel Naidoo at paragraph ...[intervenes]     Thank you Chair.  I beg your pardon.  Colonel Naidoo could you please tell the Chair about the vehicle purchased forthe use by Minister Mthethwa?    Thank you Chair.  Could you then deal with    Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo after youdelivered this vehicle to General Nchwe did you ever have contact with her again?    And why did you deliver an iPad to her?    Thank you Chair.  If we can just go back just    Yes Mr Naidoo if you have also regard to 189 you say in the last sentence of paragraph 189 on page 45.

INQUIRY RESUMESCHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us start.  Good morning Colonel Naidoo are you there? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am here Chair.  Good morning Chair.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   I will try my best to go as fast as possible.    Indeed.    I agree Chair.    Sorry Chair.    It would …    Chair that would be to page 142 that is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair my signature appears on page 152.    I am satisified.    Yes.    Chair Colonel Barnard was the Head of the Procurement Section of CI. His family members two of his family members were appointed within this promotion process of the 250 posts.  One of his relatives was appointed as a Sergeant or a Warrant Officer and another of his relatives was appointed as a clerkat the Technical Support Unit.    At that stage General Lala was the Divisional Commissioner of CI.  Chair sorry no he was not the – he was not the Divisional Commissioner he had subsequently left. I think he was going to Detective Services and I think he is now at SARS.  A family member FM37 Chair was appointed within this promotion process.  A Lieutenant General Stander who was stationed at I think at that stage she was Deputy National Commissioner one of her relatives was appointed at CI Head Office.  He was appointed and placed within the IT section of CI.  Brigadier Driena Bellingham was head of the Human Resources at CI.  Her relative was appointed to the position from a lower rank to a higher rank of Colonel. This information was relayed to me by FM09 Chair.      Brigadier Billingham would have been the person that would have dealt with these – with these issues with regards to – insofar as regards to the condonations regarding these specific individuals.    Chair then I go to…    But what I can say that FM41 was never disciplined.  Instead he was placed within the agent program as an agent.    Chair from what I understand he remained within the agent program until he retired.  Ibelieve this was done purely to – to hide him so to speak in an agent program as a favour.  I will testify to later the relationship between FM41 at that stage General or Assistant Commissioner Lala, Assistant Commissioner Mphego and General Lazarus.     Yes Chair I also believe that is what is happening.  So I will also try my best.    Yes.    Chair I refer to two incidents.  This was around 2006.  I was – I was – FM41 was my commander at that stage.  Like I testified to earlier I was a dedicatedperson to go to Head Office to – to tend to operatives’ administrative needs in terms of their claims etcetera. I recall one such incident where I was given a claim Chair or rather an advance for R40 000.00 this was for a recruitment of an agent.  I got an instruction from FM41.    It seems so Chair.    I remember getting instruction from FM41 to secure the funds of R40 000.00. The instruction that I got was that of the R40 000.00 R20 000,00 I should bring back to him and the other R20 000.00 should go to Assistant Commissioner Lala at that stage.  Chair …    A recruitment of an informer.    This was recruitment fees Chair.    Of an informer yes that iscorrect.    Correct Chair but it depends on the level of information that particular informer might – might have tentatively.    That is correct.    It is not a set amount.    But this particular instance it was R40 000.00.    Chair…CHAIRPERSON   That is correct.    No Chair.    Indeed.    Commissioner Lala Chair    I am not sure.    What it was for but in terms of the – the procedure the R40 000.00 should go to one particular person in this case it would be the informer.    Indeed.    That is correct Chair.    I refer to also remember the advance holder at that stage I cannot remember her name but I think – I believe she is deceased.  She enquired from me why is thishappening.  This is – to her this was quite irregular because if you put in a claim or an advance for a particular informer that specific amount should go to that person.  So why is the amount is being split.    The advance holder – the advance holder at that stage.  Pardon me Chair.  The advance holder at the cash office.    Chair this is essentially like I explained there were advance – advance officers where you wouldgo with your – and I explained using the petrol claim or the advance.    That is correct Chair.    Chair the job description of the advance holder is purely administrative.  It is purely to – to receive claims – advances and capture it on the system.  Because this would have already been approved by a particular commander or the individual’s commander.    That is correct Chair.  It was an advance.    And I – I handed over he R20 000.00 to this particular female whose name I cannot remember and the other R20 000.00 I took back to my own office and handed it over to FM41. Chair this was…– I handed over he R20 000.00 to this particular female whose name I cannot remember and the other R20 000.00 I took back to my own office and handed it over to FM41. Chair this was…    The other incident it involves Commission Mphego.  At that stage Commissioner Mphego was the second in charge to Commissioner Lala at CI.  I recall an incidence where – incident where FM41 told me that Commissioner Mphego is – he has traded his – one of his vehicles in.  I think it was an Isuzu bakkie and there was a shortfall on the trade-in.  I think the amount was R125 000.00 and he – he requested FM41 to make arrangements tohand the money to him.  That is the second incident Chair.    That is correct Chair.    There was a shortfall on his vehicle that he was trading in Chair yes.    Chair …    Yes Chair.  This – FM41 was a commander of one of the operational teams where I will testify tolater where informer false informer reward were processed via this office Chair.    No Chair not process the claims.  They would – they would put in false informer rewards.  In this process they would generate cash.  This was done via this office.    They would put in falseinformer rewards Chair.  In other words false intelligence or bogus intelligence reports would be generated to generate funds via that process.  This was done via FM41’s office.    He was the commander of this operational team at that stage.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair there was – I remember another incidence where FM41 had a meeting at head office and he came back and he was quite upset and he did not mention which one of – either it was General Lala or General Mphego had asked him for more funds.  It was during the month and he said to me they are getting R100 000.00 is that not enough?  And he said something to the effect “voetsak man” so he was quite upset.    That is correct Chair.    It was one of them Chair he did not mention their names he just said they are getting…    One of them asked him for more money and he was upset.    But this stage remember they were getting paid monthly.  I am not sure in my statement I say R50 to R100 000.00.  I am not sure it was R50 000.00 each.    I am – I cannot be certain.    Chair I worked underFM41 he is my – he was my commander from 2004 to 2006 so it would have been probably between that time period.    Chair like I mentioned earlier FM41 was found guilty on a vehicle related charge.  He was never disciplined.I remember having a discussion with General Lazarus and he - and he said that he wants to help the old man. He had a discussion with - with Commissioner Mphego and there was - they decided that they were going to place into the agent program and this is what General Lazarus relayed to me. Commissioner Mphego told him that I should be his handler.    No Chair.    Chair I do not know thefacts relating to this incident but I do know that he was convicted of a vehicle related crime.    Not the actual facts.    No Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I cannot say for sure what - whether it was work related or not but I - I know for fact that he was convicted on a vehicle related charge.  I say this because on numerous occasions FM41 gave me money.  There was a fine I think that he had to pay at the court. I think it was the Pretoria Court and I - I did this on numerous occasions.  I think at least on three occasions.    Chair if - if I can recall it was - at that stage he was a Colonel.  At that stage rather a Senior Superintendent.  They had a package where they had to buy a vehicle or the option of buying a vehicle on that level.  This was part of the package.    I cannot say for sure Chair.    I do Chair.    I will do so sure.  I will -I will stick to the points where I had …  Personal - personal interactions and …    I know of it personally.    That is correct Chair.  I will - I will go through as - as we speak.    It is not very clear.    Where it is hearsay and I will stick to - to the incidents where I had personal knowledge of …    Of information or on the    Chair FM42 was - is a relative of General Lazarus.  He was a policeman stationed at Tongaat until he was found guilty of corruption and dismissed from the SAPS.  He was recruited as an informer by CI Chair and paid R50 000,00 a month.  This was told to me by FM09.    Yes Chair.    FM44 was also - also a relative of General Lazarus.  Was taken up as an informer.  This wasnot told to me directly Chair but …    But the conversation that I had with FM34 I - I picked up that this particular person was recruited as an informer.    Yes.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Chair …    Chair as I previously - previously testified to that I would have been the appointed agent to handle these or rather the handler to - to handle these particularagents.  I refer to the - to the incident that happened at General Lazarus’ office between himself and General Mdluli. I was eventually tasked with handling claims for the - for the seven of the so called Mdluli family - seven agents although two I cannot confirm that they were - they were family but we included them as within the Mdluli family - seven in total.  I was tasked with handling the claims for salaries, their vehicles etcetera.  Also medical    Point out that it was FM -    That is correct.  Chair these four individuals were appointed within the Cyber Crime Unit of Crime Intelligence.  At that stage they were supposed to operate or rather they reported to Colonel Beaunard Grobler.  He was in charge of theCyber Crime Unit at that stage. Chair like I mentioned the - I handed the - the administration - the - the admin of these agents.  Operationally I did not know what they - what they did in terms of their job description.  All I know is that they were appointed within this unit.  So as far as I know operationally I did not - I did not know what - what their duties entailed or what they actually did but I did keep a - a file for each one of them in terms of their administration.    Chair I do not think they - they had a particular level of - of - their - their knowledge of computer skills I think was very basic.  I say this because they - they went for a - for a training course regarding computers which was A Plus.  I think it was very basic.  This was paid for out of the SSA. I think it was R20 000,00 for the four of them Chair.  This particular unit where they were based is the Cyber Crime Unit Chair.  Ibelieve that they should have some sort of experience or expertise to work within this environment.    I do not believe they did Chair because this computer course that they went for was quite basic.    Chair FM26 was also part of this seven agents that I handled - one person - one individual of the seven.  He was also appointed within the Cyber Crime Unit under thecommand of Colonel Beaunard Grobler.  Chair like I mentioned with the other individuals I only handled the - the admin regarding the agents. I did not know what they did operationally.  This particular individual on numerous occasions he did not report to work Chair.  I - I remember receiving a call from his commander Colonel Grobler inquiring where this particular individual was.  At that stage I did not even know where he was myself. I brought this to the attention of General Lazarus and I do not know if this particular individual was ever disciplined for this.    Yes I did.  One of my duties was to deal with petrol claims.  On numerous occasions when compiling his claims I would see that a petrol or petrol slips would have been or rather from the petrol slips I - I would see that he travelled to Mpumalanga.That is another province from where he was based Chair.  Before he left the province he should have got the prior - prior permission to leave which was not done.  This happened on multiple occasions Chair …    And as I testified too I brought all of these things to the attention of General Lazarus and I am not sure what happened to him and he would be away from work for extended periods.    Yes Chair.  FM28 and FM27 worked from a covert premises in Johannesburg.  Chair this - these two individuals were supposedly report or supposed to report to Colonel Barnard under the loss management.  Chair if I can just give you some insight. The loss management already had a loss - loss or rather Company X already had a Loss Management Section at their office.  This was basically created another - another office - a covert office was created to provide - to provide employment for these two individuals.  So there was actually no need for this office because the - it is actually a parallel structure to what was already in place. So there was no need for this - so this - for this office Chair. So in my view this office was created just to create employment for these two individuals - FM28 and FM27.    I am not sure but I know the - there - there is multiple directors.  I am not sure who they are but General Lazarus as the CFO of the Secret Service Account would have been one of those directors.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair …CHAIRPERSON   Chair I do not know this for sure.  I - I know that general - this was a set up as a normal company Chair …    But it was a front company.  So it had to operate like a normal company would - would.  So it was - it was a front company of Crime Intelligence.  So I am assuming that …    Yes Chair.  The - the members of Crime Intelligence or some members …  Especially General Lazarus being the CFO of the Secret Service Account …    Would be a director.    That is correct Chair.    No Chair.  Not at all.    No Chair.    That is correct.  Chair on numerous occasions I had to deal with FM28 and FM27 regarding the payment of salaries reconciling their petrol claims or just to - to visit them at theoffice.  On numerous occasions or most of the occasions they would not be in the office Chair. They would either be at home or they would be at the mall shopping.  I know this because when I would phone them they would tell me they are at the mall or they are at home.  It was very rarely that I found them at the office.    Two - two of - two of them.    Yes.  That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   That is correct Chair.    Chair …    These are two separate files but it would be with the handler.  In this case Chair like I mentioned I did not know what they did operationally except that I handled their - their petrol claims and their medical and - and the payment of their salaries.  So the function was actually split. So operationally I did not know what they did except to pay their salaries and their - their medical and petrol claims.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Like - like I said Chair the four individuals as I previously - previously testified to - reported toColonel Beaunard Grobler.  FM28 and FM27 they were placed with the Loss Management but or rather Colonel Barnard was head of procurement which Loss Management fell under.  So I really do not know what they did Chair.    Like I said this - this was a parallel structure that was created basically for - for their employment but they did not thing at that office.    Yes Chair.  These four individuals when they placed within the (indistinct) Program.  They were not getting the - the salary that they were appointed on.  Sobasically there was a shortfall on their salary.  So I took advances to cover the shortfall and once they got the - the actual salary that they were appointed on - the level - those advances would be paid back.    It was.  I think it was about - for about three or four months until their - their actual promotions were - were captured on the system.  Chair I believe it exceeded R5 million but obviously this is just an estimate.  I can confirm if all the documents regarding these several agents are shown to me.    Five million Chair.    This was - from 2010 from the inception of their - of their being employed as agents to around 2011.  That is when I went to witness protection Chair.  So from March 2010 to around October 2011.    Chair this would be the seven - the seven members as I regard it to - I explained of the Mdluli family - seven members Chair.    That is correct Chair.    It would have been thefirst - the first part of the year.    Yes Chair.    Probably in the first quarter.    That is correct Chair.    Indeed.    That is correct Chair.    Chair this - this would include their salaries, their medical bills, the vehicles that was purchased for them, the hiring of safe houses, setting up of safe houses ja.    Chair, I - I …    I cannot say for surebecause they were - they were employed on different levels.    So it …    Chair I cannot say for sure the exact or more or less the figure, but what I can say is one was a Colonel, one a Lieutenant Colonel, a Warrant Officer, one a Captain, one was a Sergeant, I cannot say for sure, I will have to ...[intervenes]      Ja.    Yes Chair.    Yes, if I am looking at the seven individuals and if I am just glancing at their levels, I think it would be more than that.    I would say so.    Indeed Chair, you alsohave to add to that five million the vehicles.    The procurement of safe houses.    I think it is a fair reflection Chair.    Yes.  Chair yes I did…[intervenes].    Chair as point 98 this is indeed correct Chair, General Sibiya who is current head of the Hawks but at that state he was the Deputy National Commissioner, he wasn’t the head of the Hawks.  It’s correct in saying he is the current head of the Hawks, at that stage I’m given to understand that he was the Deputy National Commissioner.  He was tasked with investigating the 250 posts.    If I can recall he was the Deputy National Commissioner.    He subsequently left the police chair and then he came – he was reinstated and this is the position that he holds at the present moment, he is current head of the Hawks, Chair…[intervenes].    Yes Chair I rememberhaving a conversation with General Lazarus where he informed me that himself and General Mdluli had a discussion and they were considering placing General Sibiya’s wife’s name on the list and I’m talking about, when I mention the list, I’m speaking of the 250 posts, the covert posts.    Chair I believe or rather the discussion I had with General Lazarus stating that they were considering this, I assumed that this was to – either to strong arm General Sibiya during the investigation or to use a stronger word,    General Lazarus, he told me that he had a discussion with General Mdluli, they were considering Chair, placing General Sibiya’s wife’s name on the list for promotion within the 250 posts.    Not that I’m aware of Chair.    Not false informationChair, they were deliberately going to place her name on the list without General Sibiya knowing about it, so that they could possibly use this against him in strong arming him during the investigation regarding the 250 post.    For employment Chair within the 250 posts for promotion within Crime Intelligence.    The latter is correct Chair.    No Chair, sorry my apologies.    Yes Chair, basically what happened was, they were going to place her name within the list without General Sibiya’s knowledge.    Chair I can confirm that I had the conversation with General Lazarus – that he had with General Mdluli regarding the placement of General Sibiya’s wife’s name on the list, whether this actually transpired Chair, I can’t be sure.    That is correct.    Chair I won’t go into the detail of the contact person, the informer, I think I set that out previously but I’ll go to an incident, Chair where I was personally involved, like you mentioned earlier I should stay away from the incidents where I’m going to make assumptions.    This is where I was personally involved.  I accompanied FM41 for a meeting with the so-called informer, in my presence Chair, I think this meeting was held ata restaurant in Pretoria where he got this particular individual to sign receipts, blank receipts, six receipts Chair.  Chair in this manner…[intervenes].    Chair I don’t know what was the outcome of that process Chair.    Chair the appointments took place around 2010.    No Chair.    Chair I think that would have been information restricted to – sat with General Mdluli I think he – because he was the Divisional of CI at that stage.    So the report would probably have gone back to him.    That’s correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Thank you.    I will do so.    Yes Chair I was on the point of the informer rewards.  I believe the system was abused Chair.  I say so because on one occasion I was in the company of FM41 where we attended a meeting with a so called – when I say so called I will get to that – informer.  This particular individual FM41 got him to sign six receipts.  Chair in essence these six receipts are six blank cheques in terms of the system for Crime Intelligence.  Because basically in this way operational expenses and informer rewards can be put in for that particular – or so called informer for a period of three months.  And any amount that would be at the discretion of the commander being in thiscase being FM41.  He could put in any amount on those – on those receipts being already being signed – six at one go by the informer.    That is correct Chair.  If I may just ex…    That is correct Chair.  If I may just explain?  When an informer is handed cash by his – by ahandler Chair.    He needs to acknowledge receipt of that cash.    So he needs to write in the amount in words, the actual amount be it R10.00 or R20.00 and sign for it in the presence of a handler.    In this case six receipts were signed at one go without any amount being written on the receipts.  So in essence like I said this was six blank cheques in terms of the process for Crime Intelligence.    Sorry Chair I did not get that.    Yes Chair but in a  normal circumstance Chair if an informer gets operational expense it would be one receipt stating that he had received that particular    And if it was informer rewards it would be another receipt stating that – acknowledging that he had received X amount.  Like I said in this case six receipts were signed at one go.    It was blank Chair just his signature.    The latter is correct    That is correct Chair.    Chair it was in Pretoria.  I think it was the – we met outside the Blue Crane Restaurant inPretoria Chair.  It was myself, FM41 and the actual – well I say actual it was the person who – the so called informer who signed the six blank receipts.    Chair I believe I am saying this is not fact I believe how the system was abused insofar as the informer rewards go.  The instance where six receipts were signed at one go that is not proper procedure.  It should be one at a time for a specific amount.  In this – In this manner false intelligence reports can be generated against this informer’s name and informer rewards – false informer rewards generated via this process.  I also want to mention Chair FM – just to give you some insight as to how the process unfolded or took place.  FM45 who at that stage was second in charge to FM41.  He told me that FM41 had a – had a contract at OrganisedCrime Chair in Pretoria.  They devised a scheme where they would use organised crime – the SAPS case numbers and the exhibit numbers of organised crime and use it against intelligence that – or false intelligence that was generated in this manner.  False informer rewards could be gene – or false informer rewards or money from false informer rewards could be generated in this manner Chair.  As I explained of the six blank receipts this would be used in this process as well.      Chair he could – he could – he could be legitimate informer or not.  I cannot say that for sure.     But the process that transpired was – was not legitimate.    It was – it was an operational team based within the environment of Crime Intelligence. Crime Intelligence Gathering more especially dealing or addressing drug and vehicle related syndicates.      FM45 was the second in charge to FM41.    That is correct.    Chair in essence what this means is that they would – the contact I do not know who this contact is but the contact was at Organised Crime.  They would use Organised Crime CAS numbers and Exhibit numbers basically use that on the Intelligence Reports to generate informer rewards.  I also referred to a – to a conversation that I had with one of the members at that stage.  It was a Warrant Officer Phil Vermeulen.  He told me there was – there was a – there was a success on metal and platinum but the value was – was – it was only R500.00 Chair.  However the actual or the false success for this – for this particular recovery of the platinum was actually in the – in the vicinity of R5 million.    No Chair the actual success was R500.00 where the metal was – precious metal or socalled precious metal was recovered but the actual value was R500.00.    Yes Chair.    And…    That is correct Chair.    The success for the recovery of this metal was reflected as R5 million and the informer reward would have generated – been generated on a success of R5 million and not R500.00.  This is what was told to me by this particular individual.    That is correct Chair.    This was not told to me Chair I am not aware of the actual informer reward.    That is correct.  This – this particular individual who relayed this information to me was one of the members from that office at that time.    That is exactly how you explained it Ms Wentzel.  These case numbers used from case numbers and the SAP numbers would be used on Crime Intelligence Progress Reports of Success Reports and as a result informer rewards will be –can be generated through this process.    Chair I am – I do not think the informer would have had any role in this.  Like I explained earlier the informer – one informer signed six blank receipts.    So I do not think the informer would have had any knowledge of what the actual – actual success was.    That is correct Chair.    Indeed.    Yes Chair.    It would have to be filled out by – are you talking about – sorry Ms Wentzel you talking about the receipt that…    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    It would be the handler.    That is correct.    That is correct.  That file would in essence track the productivity of that particular informer for that month but I believe that false intelligence reports were generated to facilitate this.    Explaining how the system worked and how the funds were generated I do not think that particular person had worked on any of the – of the so called report regarding the success.    Yes.    Chair I think we will stay away from these aspects because it is also operational matters.    But I have knowledge ofsafe houses that were abused.  If I can go to those ones?    Because that is where I have personal knowledge of…    Of the safe houses so we will skip 109 to 112.3 and go to 113.    Is that okay Chair?    Okay.  CHAIRPERSON   Chair like Ms Wentzel said this – this particular flat or apartment belonged to General Mdluli in the Western Cape. I was informed by General Lazarus that General Mdluli wants to – wants us – when I say us CI to rent his flat as a safe house.  I was instructed by General Lazarus to fly to Cape Town.  Chair I must also add Mr John Appalsamy of Daez Trading also a friend ofGeneral Lazarus.  I was instructed that this particular individual should accompany me to Cape Town.  This was purely to – so that he can have knowledge of where the premises is because the – this particular flat would have to be rented or leased rather through his company Daez Trading.  Chair Mr Appalsamy flew with me to Cape Town.  Like I said this was an instruction of General Lazarus.  I also got instruction from General Lazarus that I should draw an advance for the ticket for Mr Appalsamy so basically his ticket was paid out of the Secret Service Account.  These were all instructions that I got from General Lazarus.  Chair when I tried to reconcile this particular advance General Lazarus instructed me to erase the name of Mr Appalsamy which I did. This was purely not to expose who the real person was that travelled via the Secret Service Account which was actually Mr John Appalsamy of Daez Trading.    From the ticket that I had purchased for him that – on the ticket that we – I purchased for him to travel to Cape Town with me.    I just used a black    That is correct Chair.    No Chair this – maybe I must just explain.  Sorry I was not too clear.  This was on our return from Cape Town I requested the ticket from Mr Appalsamy because I had to reconcile my advance that I had taken initially to pay for his ticket.    Chair in order for – if I can just give some insight Chair if I may?  In order to reconcile this – this particular advance I had to put in a receipt or in this case beingthe air ticket because the price would have been on the air ticket.    So in order to – to – for that particular claim to be reconciled I requested the air ticket from Mr Appalsamy.    And on instruction of General Lazarus the name – his actual name on the ticket was blacked out so it was not visible.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    This was done purely to hide the identity of Mr Appalsamy.    That is correct Chair.  He was a friend of General Lazarus.    He was Chair.  He had numerous other – basically Mr Appalsamy’s company Daez Trading was a broker which Crime Intelligence leased numerous safe houses through his company Daez Trading.    That is correct Chair.  In this instance instead of the safe house being leased directly from the actual owner Mr Appalsamy was sort of a broker.  So he would – so the lease would say that it is Daez Trading as if Daez Trading is the owner of that particular property but in fact it was not.  So he is basically a middle man.    Yes I am there.    That is correct.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Indeed.    Ja.    Rolebile.    Chair Colonel Rolebile was the Head of Facility Management of Crime Intelligence.  So basically Colonel Rolebile was signing this lease although in his personal capacity but it was on behalf of Crime Intelligence.  So basically this lease was between Daez Trading and Mr Rolebile but an extension to Crime Intelligence.  Because he acted on as in that capacity as Head of Facility Management of Crime Intelligence.    No.  Daez Trading did not own that property.    The lease says three months starting on 31 January - oh sorry.  Did I say three months?    Pardon me.  It is three years.Starting on 1 February 2010 and terminating on 31 January 2013.    The rent would be 8 500    Chair it was in a security estate or complex.  Two bedroom apartment Chair …  With an open plan kitchen …    And living area.    Chair if I can just explain how this worked.  Daez Trading would invoice Company X for theamount of 8 500.  I - I am not sure if the amenities were included in that - in his invoice.  It probably would but in essence what happened at the end of each month I would get a call from Mr Appalsamy. He would give me cash.  This was generated from - from the - the rent of this particular safe house and I would then hand over that cash of R7 000,00 to General Mdluli.  This was on a monthly basis.    Chair this was - I amassuming that was what Mr Appalsamy of Daez Trading invoiced Company X as a commission for his brokerage or broker fee.  This was - this would also include VAT if I am not mistaken.  So he would take - take out that portion that he would receive from Company X and give me the balance of R7 000,00 which I would then hand over to - to General Mdluli.    That is correct.  An amount of 7 000.    That is correct Chair.  Mr Appalsamy would meet me on a monthly basis.  If - if his bank records or subpoenaed Chair you will see the pattern of every month plus/minus five days to the month end an amount of R13 000,00 wouldbe - in cash would be drawn from his account. I will testify to - when I say 13 000 one would ask the question why is it only seven here.  There was another - another flat in Cape Town that belonged to General Lala.  He would receive R6 000,00.  So the amount of 13 000 every month that I would receive from Mr Appalsamy of Daez Trading. The 7 000 would go to General Mdluli and 6 000 to General Lala.  This was on a monthly basis.    I think for a period of ayear.  Chair it was 1 February 2010 to 31 January 2013 but this - this did not go on for the full period Chair.  I think it was only for the period of probably around - probably about a year because in 20 - in 2011 around about March - February/March if I can recall correctly General Mdluli was arrested at that stage - 2011.    So this lease ceased.  It did not go on Chair.  Although in paper it says three years but it wasonly for a period about a year.    Chair it was not related to this issue at all.  If I can recall - recollect or recall correctly it was some other matters regarding a murder and kidnapping.  If I can recall correctly.    So it was not connected    Yes I did.  Ms Wentzel if I can just explain before I get to that Chair.  What was Mr Appalsamy’s reason to fly with me and this is what I believe.  Chair if - if there was an inspection to be done on these premises that was going to be rented out by CI I could have done that myself Chair.  At this stage if I remember correctly I was working at the Facility Management under Colonel (indistinct). So there was no need for Mr Appalsamy to accompany me on the version that if there was an inspection to be done to see if this is feasible for Crime Intelligence to indeed rent this particular property.  Ibelieve that Mr Appalsamy flew with me so that he has at least knowledge of where this particular property is so if there was any query because remember he signed as - as owning this property.    So if there was a query at least he had some knowledge of where it was.  This is what I believe Chair.  This is why Mr Appalsamy accompanied me on this trip.    Just one second.  I am not sure Ms Wentzel.  Those details are not on - on the lease agreement and I cannot recall where I was at that stage.    Yes Chair.  Upon its arrival in Cape Town and inspecting the property basic …    I - I personally ordered the furniture on instructions of General Lazarus for the premises ofboth General Lala and General Mdluli.  It was a service provider or supplier to Crime Intelligence.  Masons Furniture in Benoni.  I think they are situated in Benoni Chair. I - I cannot recall exactly what was purchased - what assets were purchased but in terms of General Mdluli’s flat it was a two bedroom flat.  So I would take it that would be two beds.  The - for the living areas TVs, lounge set and your small appliances for the kitchen.    Chair it would probably be in the region of 50 to R60 000,00 but if the - these - these expenses would be posted against this particular SR Number if the documents are showed - shown to me I can confirm that it is indeed for that premises.    Chair, I - I cannot recall exactly but I - I think it would be for both.  For - for General Mdluli’s premises and General Lala.    Yes Chair.  This was also a property leased by Crime Intelligence via Daez Trading through Mr John Appalsamy’s company.  This was for the sole use ofGeneral Mdluli although myself and General Lazarus had had access to this particular property. It was situated within a security estate.  When I say had access to it.  I never used it myself and I am not aware of General Lazarus using it but when I say we had access is when from time to time I picked up General Lazarus to go to this particular premises for General Lazarus to have meetings with General Mdluli.    That is correct Chair.    Chair it was - it was used only by General Mdluli as far as I know.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   I - I cannot say for sure Chair.    Chair it is possible.  I am not sure.  I do not know.  I am not very clear with regards to the policy but it is possible yes.    No Chair.  The - the one that I referred to or testified to previously that - that property belonged to General Mdluli.  That was in Gordon’s Bay in the Western Cape.    This one we are referring to is in Clearwater Estate in Gauteng Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    Chair if I remembercorrectly I also was responsible for - this was quite a - a big house.  It was in an upmarket security estate.  I also ordered furniture and general appliances for this particular premises.  Also again from Masons Furniture - supplier to Crime Intelligence.  A big screen TV surround system.    Hm.  Yes Chair.As I mentioned I - I - the home was furnished as a residence Chair.  As anynormal residence would be.  I was responsible for - for purchasing or acquiring this - the furniture.  This was done through Masons Chair.  Our service provider that Crime Intelligence used. They were situated in Benoni.  As far as I know a TV, a surround sound DSTV, fridge, washing machine and Chair general small appliances crockery.  Chair it - it was furnished as a - as a normal house would be furnished.  Basically from scratch.  Everything was purchased for - for this particular house.    Chair I was responsible Chair for - for the upkeep of this particular house.  I was also required to ensure that when General Mdluli was there that the house was stocked with groceries.  Also paid out - as I previously testified - also paid out from funds - from funds from the Secret Service Account.    Chair at some stage I - I am just going to check the FM numbers.  I remember this clearly Chair. This was an incident where I had drop General Mdluli off at - I - I picked him up from - from his office.  That is the Crime Intelligence Office in Pretoria and I dropped him off at this particular safe house being Clearwater Estate. When I got there Chair I noticed two individuals whom I mention as FM24 and FM29.    I also recall seeing two children at this premises Chair.  This was family of General Mdluli.    Yes Chair.  Chair I mentioned earlier that I flew to Cape Town to inspect the property of General Mdluli.  On this same trip Chair also an instruction from General Lazarus I went to General Lala’s flat situated in Rondebosch Cape Town. This particular premises was also rented as a safe housethrough Crime Intelligence also through Daez Trading.  Chair as I mentioned earlier the same scenario.  It was through Daez Trading.  The same procedure.  I would get - at the end of each month I would collect the rent from Mr Appalsamy and hand over the cash to - to General Lala.  This was R6 000,00 per month.    Chair, I - I am not too sure regarding the policy with regard to these premises.  So I cannot say Chair.  I am not too sure.    What the policy exactly was.    No Chair because theactual owners of the properties were not revealed.  It was done through Daez Trading.  So this in itself was not transparent because it did not reveal who the real owners were Chair.    Chair in terms of the transparency it was not Chair because it was actually the - the owners - the real owners of the actual properties were concealed.  As I previously testified to Mr John Appalsamy his company Daez Trading signed as the owners of or - or rather being the owner of these properties.So it was in - in essence not transparent because he did not reveal who the real owners were.    I am not sure Chair.  I am not certain.    Chair as far as recall - Ican recall it is not - it is not just to these premises Chair.  There was another premises that was - that was leased in this process.    Hm.    Hm.CHAIRPERSON   That is correct Chair.    I - I would assume so Chair.    Pardon Chair.    Pardon me Chair.  I am not.  I do not understand the question.    Sorry.  I am …    Ja.  I am - I am a bit confused.    So I …CHAIRPERSON Chair it was not General Lazarus’ house Chair.  It was just General Mdluli and General Lala.    Yes Chair.    But obviously in terms of the policy I do not what the policy says.    Yes Chair.     No Chair.    No Chair it was limited, Daez Trading the leases done through Daez Trading were limited to afew safe houses including the two that I mentioned now.    Or rather the three, sorry, it was the three, the one of General Mdluli, one of the General Lalla and the one I just spoke of now is Clearwater Estate.    Chair as in general, you’re speaking as in general or particularly through Daez Trading?    Yes Chair there were many, there were many premises.    Yes Chair.    No Chair.    Not some, most this was – Daez Trading was involved in a very small percentage of the biggerpicture, it was probably four or five premises in total.    Chair that’s a tough question but I’ll try.    I would say, Chair,looking at nine provinces, when I say nine provinces, head office is also regarded as a province.    I would say at least between seven and eight because each operational team would have to operate out of a safe house.  I would say at least ten per province Chair.    I would say a very rough estimate.    That is correct Chair.    I would say four or five over a period of time, I think five Chair.    I can’t say there was no such company Chair, because I’m not aware of it so I can’t say therewas no such other company that played a similar role to Daez Trading in terms of the safe houses.    Correct Chair.      It is possible Chair yes.    Yes.    I say that Chair on the background of what I’ve testified to earlier, in terms of the cash being given to me on a monthly basis to buy Mr John Appelsami, this has subsequently handed over to General Mdluli of R7 000 and General Lalla of R6 000 respectively.  So it is my belief that had – this was purely done as to not to reveal who the actual owners were in terms of paying them cash as opposed to the monies being EFT or transferred totheir accounts directly.    That is correct Chair.    Payments can be done either via – it will definitely not be done by EFT Chair, it would be either by cash or cheque from company X.    It’s – like I said thatprocess is in place Chair where cash can be paid but it’s just my belief that it was done in this process so these individuals are not exposed as the true owners.    Chair nowhere in the records would you find General Mdluli’s name or General Lalla’s nameor any way having any links to them at all.    Yes Chair, you would be able to.    Yes Chair this was a property leased from C L Dicks, Chair C L Dicks is the daughter of Joe Marx, as I testified earlier Mr Joe Marx is the owner of New World Motors, New World Motors is a supplier or service provider to company X.  Chair, I myself negotiated an agreement with Mr Marx this was doneon instruction of General Lazarus for the actual lease to be inflated by R2 000 per month.    Chair, I’m not sure the exact amount of the rent, but whatever the rent was, my instruction that it be inflated by R2 000.  If I’m shown the documents, I can confirm that it for this particular premises.  So basically whathappened here, the funds were accumulated over a period of every month, that R2 000 would accumulate and over a period of a year you – if the calculations are done it’s R24 000 Chair.    This money I collected on instruction again from General Lazarus at the end of the year which was R24 000 and this we divided between ourselves.  When I say ourselves it’s between myself and General Lazarus.    That’s the R2 000 per month.    Over a period of the year.    I must also make mention Chair at the end of the year we would collect the money but in this instance I think this particular year I took an advance from Mr Marx, this also and instruction from General Lazarus Chair because he was going on an overseas trip, he was accompanying Mr Marimuthu on a trip overseas and he instructed me to get an advance from Mr Joe Marx to the amount of R10 000, so this would be settled obviously it wouldbe R10 000 less end of the year.    The surplus on the rent Chair.   So instead of …[intervenes].    That’s correct Chair and if it accumulated over the twelve month period it would be R24 000 but in this case it would be R10 000 less because during the year I had collected an amount of R10 000 from Mr Marx which I subsequently handed to General Lazarus, this was on General Lazarus’ instruction as he was accompanying Mr Marimuthu on an overseas trip, so he neededsome cash.    So in essence at the end of the year instead of getting R24 000 it was only R14 000.    All you have said Miss Wentzel is correct except it wasn’t General Lazarus who collected the money it was myself.      Yes the money would then be split between ourselves.    That is correct Chair.    Chair this is the same manner Chair as I’ve mentioned to you previously, this was – but in thiscase this was not – Mr Joe Marx’s daughter was a private individual, this company – this premises was rented through Daez Trading, Mr Appelsami again.  General Lazarus instructed me to negotiate, or rather not to negotiate, to inform Mr Appelsami that in the same process as I mentioned earlier in the previous – with regard to the previous safe house, the rent was inflated Chair and as previously mentioned it would accumulate, that amount would be kept by Mr Appelsami for the use of General Lazarus, I can’t recall if I also collected money from this particular transaction.  However, on one occasion Chair, General Lazarus instructed me to collect R6 000 from Mr Appelsami which Isubsequently handed of to General Lazarus, this also Chair, was also a trip – he wanted General Lazarus wanted cash because he was also going on another trip with Mr Marimuthu.  Chair if I recall this was around 2010.    Sure Chair as I testified to previously General Lazarus had struck up a relationship with Mr Marimuthu, basically to get a ear to – or get a ear from Mr Bheki Cele at that stage, this was when the relationship between General Lazarus and Mr Marimuthu is already established, various properties were also rented from Mr Marimuthu Chair the amount totally in the vicinity of R200 000 to R250 000 Chair, all of this information Chair was relayed to me by FM08.  At that stage FM08 was the person that was in chargeof these premises that were being rented by or rather from Mr Marimuthu by Crime Intelligence.     With – I assumed that it would be for safe – for the use of safe, as a safe house Chair.    Chair I’m not certain    I’m not certain.    Chair I can say for a fact that at least two of them were in KZN because I personally went – I’m not sure the rest of them where they were situated.    But two of these were in KZN because I personally visited these properties.    Chair just for the record as well the properties that I visited, these were not ready, or not suitable for occupation at that stage.  I brought this to the attention of General Lazarus Chair, I’m not certain what measures he took after meinforming him about the unsuitability regarding these two premises that I inspected.      Chair I can’t say for certain that these were already on Crime Intelligence books, however, if the documents are shown to me and I can cross-reference it to the flights that I took to KZN I can be more certain or I can be moreprecise.    Chair it would have been probably – probably late 2010 or early 2011 I can’t be certain.    It was on one trip Chair.      Both these properties were in Umhlanga Rocks, not far from Mr Marimuthu’s home.    The other one Chair which was not far off from the one that I’m speaking of now, that was in better condition Chair, though it wasn’t occupation ready, when I say that, the toilets were not working, there were other items or I can remember correctly I’m just trying to re-call, pardon meChar…[intervenes].    The toilets.    Just generally, I can’t give you specifics Chair but just generally the property was not occupation ready.    Yes Chair, this was later in 2011 I say this because this was closer to the time that I was – I think it was a few months before I was admitted into the witnessprotection programme.  Chair on the instruction of General Lazarus again through Deaz Trading an apartment in Boksburg was procured for the exclusive use of Mr Marimuthu’s girlfriend, FM18 was appointed as a clerk in CI and she was appointed within the 250 posts Chair, if I can call it.      All of these things were done on instruction of General Lazarus Chair.    Chair what I’m going toexplain next is also an assumption on my side but I will explain what happened.  I’m assuming that by that stage this was General Lazarus and Mr Marimuthu’s relationship was quite well established by then, I think it was over a year or a year and a half that they had first met each other and began their relationship.  It is my view that Mr Marimuthu knew too much of the workings of Crime Intelligence and more so General Lazarus’ activities himself within Crime Intelligence and I say this, it’s my view that this particular premises was procured for FM18 Chair on an instruction of General Lazarus, he asked me to – sorry Chair I’m just trying to gather my thoughts.    When this property was procured via Daez Trading Chair or rented via Daez Trading, he asked me to get hold of FM11 and FM03 to arrange for cameras to be installed    I say this …[intervenes].    Chair I assumed that General Lazarus wanted to have some recording of Mr Marimuthu’s engagements with his girlfriend, who I’ve mentioned earlier FM18 so that probably he could have some evidence against Mr Marimuthu should he – should the need arise and I say this is just my view Chair but this is exactly what happened.    Yes Ms Wentzel.    Yes.    Chair before we go there if I can just complete the previous testimony regarding point 143 and144.    I did mention that I made an assumption on this but I just want to clarify Chair.  The assumption was not on the premises whether the premises was rented or not.  That was not the assumption.  I definitely know of the premises I was there personally, physically saw the premises.  I can also point it out.  The assumption was why those cameras were installed and that was the assumption that I believed that General Lazarus wanted these cameras to be installed so that he could have some evidence against MrMurimuthu if the need arises or rose in future.    Yes Chair will do so.  Thanks.    Yes Chair.  Chair this is a facility belonging to the state.  Like Ms Wentzel mentioned it is called Island Rock.  It is situated in Northern Kwazulu Natal Chair.  It istotally secluded. The only way to get to this particular premise is through – by means of a 4x4 vehicle otherwise it is not accessible at all.  Chair General Lazarus and myself and numerous other officials or confidantes within his inner circle visited this particular premises.  We would go there for holidays particularly over long weekends, school holidays, over Christmas.  Like I mentioned Chair it is not possible to access this particular facility with a normal vehicle.  You need a 4x4.  Hence state vehicles were used on these trips Chair.      Chair it is basically wooden structures.  There was one – one big open area which housed the kitchen and your living areas.  One small section of the main house also accommodated the camp manager.  If I remember correctly he is Captain Pete Nel.  Chair also is very important because this particular individual that I mentioned can confirm all of these visits because he was a camp manager for many years there including the time that I am going to testify to.      There was – if I remember correctly Chair there were four other rooms or houses if you want to call it.  Each one had two rooms in each – in each house.  Cabins Chair not houses sorry it was cabins.    Chair I think it would easily accommodate 20 people at a time.    Yes that is correct Chair.    Chair myself yes I went there on a few occasions with General Lazarus and at least on two occasions with my family.    Together with General Lazarus and other members of his inner circle.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That would the…    That is correct Chair.    There were three other individuals that were employed there that lived on the premises Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Mostly …    Mostly holidays – mostly holidays Chair.    But there were two incidents or occasions where I can remember where actual work wasdone.  It was a getaway for the group of Crime Intelligence members I think it was from the Finance section this was from General Lazarus’ office.  Where they had I think it was over two days.    Chair this belongs to the state.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.  I personally know of Mr Joe Marks because on one occasion he attended or went to this premises.  It was Mr Joe Marks and his son and including General Lazarus, myself and a few other members whom I cannot recall at this stage. That was one supplier.  The other supplier was Mr Jan Venter of Atlantis Motors.  I did not see him there physically but Mr Venter informed me on one occasion that he was going there on a weekend    Camp commander, camp manager I am sure it -  I am not sure if it the same thing Chair probably would be.    I would think so Chair but – but the question is there but the person itself was definitelyCaptain Pete Nel.    That is correct Chair.    Chair before I go there I just want to confirm that all of these visits to this Island Rock facility would have been posted as operational expenses and would have been paid out of the Secret Service Account.    That is correct.    Chair over a period of a few years I – it would have probably been about seven or eight times.    In total.    In total and of that total two was with my family    Official purposes yes.    Chair whichever personwent for that particular – I am talking about [indistinct].    That is correct Chair in terms of the vehicles used.    And all expenses that was for that particular period.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   No Chair.    No.    Chair this was a private property.  It was rented by Crime Intelligence but more especially for the use of General Lazarus and most of the members within his inner circle that included myself.  I went there on two occasions or rather on a few occasions.  I stayed there at this property.  Pardon which – on a few occasions I visited this property together with my family.  It was anupmarket property Chair within the precinct of Ballito.      It was four bedrooms Chair.  It was very upmarket on the beach front.    Chair I cannot remember exactly but I have been there a few times.    That is correct.CHAIRPERSON   That is correct Chair.    As far as I know yes.    Chair it was FM09, FM46,     It would be General Lazarus.    On a few occasions when I went there I – I think on two occasions Chair there were various other members from General Lazarus’ extended family that were there.  Thiswas over a Christmas period.    His immediate family and his extended family.  FM11 also I would include in that list.    Yes Chair.  Chair this – as I testified to previously in 2006 General Lazarus was busy withextensions or rather not extensions renovations to his house in Edenvale.  I think it was about two or three months into the renovations Chair there was a hijacking outside of his house.  It was a state vehicle that he was driving at that stage.  I think it was – it was FM07 shot one of the hijackers and the vehicle was also damaged because the suspect shot at this vehicle as well – the state vehicle.  Chair like I also testified to previously General Lazarus would travel to me – with me to his office.  So I would pick him up in the morning.  The morning of the – this happened in the weekend.  I cannot remember exactly which weekend on a Saturday.  When I fetched him from his house on that Monday on our way to work we were just discussing.  It was general conversation regarding the hijacking of the previous weekend or the weekend that passed.  And he said to me we can piggy back on this thing if you know what I mean.  And he would talk to General Lala about    Chair if I can continue?    I assume that he did get the approval from General Lala as General Lazarus instructed me to make enquiries or rather Chair sorry if I can just go back?  After he told me we can piggy back on this think if you know what I mean and he asked me to make enquiries regarding a safe premises and that he would speak to General Lala about it.  I presume that he did get the necessary approval because he instructed me to secure our safe housefor him.      Chair like I mentioned he was renovating his house at that stage.  It was quite extensive.  The house was virtually gutted in terms of the roof being taken down.  He was living at the back of the house or rather within the house in the back – two rooms.  So it was quite messy Chair.  So what I understood from this is that while the renovations using the hijacking – piggy backing on the hijacking that he will speak to General Lala so that he can move into a safe premises using the hijacking as a threat.  But actually it was because of the renovations.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I eventually found or managed to find a premises which I will refer to as X Estate in Greenstone in Johannesburg which is not far from …    X Estates.CHAIRPERSON   Yes that is correct Chair.    This was situated approximately about five or seven kilometres away from General Lazarus’ house.  This particular premises that I speak of.  General Lazarus together with his family they lived in this premises for I think it was just a period under a year Chair.  The rent for this particular premises was R6 000.00 per month.  I was responsible to take care of insofar as the payments, the rent, the amenities, the DSTV etcetera.  I also had to make arrangements Chair to have this particular premises furnished.  This was paid from funds out of the Secret Service Account.      No Chair.  If I am given the documents I can confirm but I think it was – this lease was taken for a period of one year.  There was still outstanding two months that was left over on this particular lease when General Lazarus moved back into his own house.  This was done when the renovations were completed.  He moved out of this safe house.    Chair the furniture a 3seater lounge set was given to Colonel Miranda Venter.  I received a dishwasher and a television stand.  Some other items were taken to General Lazarus to his own property.  The rest of the items I believe were [indistinct] off or auctioned off.    Sorry Chair I did not hear that?    You say in paragraph 154 that the furniture from the house was bordered.  You put that in quotes?    Chair is simply a term when an asset has reached its shelf life if you want to call it then it is auctioned off or bordered.    Chair I speak under correction I do not know the exact process but it would probably go on auction through a tender process.    And subsequently be    And be sold off and taken off the system.    Chair FM10 is a Colonel within Crime Intelligence and he is also a businessman. He owns numerous properties some of which were leased by CI as safe houses.  I know at least one property in Bedfordview – Bedfordview which was rented from CI. Chair this I do not have direct knowledge of but this information was relayed to me by FM 08.    I have not been to this    But this information was relayed to me by FM08.    That is…    That is correct Chair.    Chair I am also going to not delve on this aspect because most of it is hearsay.      So I am going to skip that as well.    And we go to Karin Hanekom Attorneys if I may?    Chair Karin HanekomAttorneys were the conveyancing attorneys they were basically dealing with the transfer that was purchase by General Mdluli.    Yes Chair.    I will do so Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Not for the purchase but I was present when the purchases were made.    Chair this is a private    When this property was being constructed or rather in its completion FM09 – FM09 -0 sorry Chair.  FM07.    General Lazarus and myself made arrangements to purchase furniture for this particular private property using funds from the Secret Service Account.  The items were purchased from New World. Chair this is not now New World    It is another service provider to Company X but it is called New World.    That is just…    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair this was not – thiswas developed as a private property.  It was not a safe house.  It was in the process of being built.    So I think that is as far as I can take you there.    Indeed Chair.    Chair I will now go to Karin Hanekom Attorneys     Point 163.    As I mentioned this was attorneys that were appointed as a conveyancing attorney dealing with the transfer of a property purchased by General Mdluli and Chair I can -if I can just explain how I got involved in this.  I remember having a conversation with General Lazarus. He informed me that General Mdluli gave him a cheque.  That was to be deposited into this account of Karin Hanekom Attorneys.  It was for this property that he was purchasing at the time.  General Mdluli was travelling somewhere Chair.  He was out of the country. I cannot recall what General Lazarus exactly said but he was not available.  He instructed me to - to deposit this cheque of    It seems to be a common thread Chair, yes.    It seems to be a common number, yes.    Chair General Lazarus further instructed me to take an advance from the advance office of R30 000,00.  So the total amount of R70 000,00 would be deposited into this account of Karin Hanekom Attorneys.  This was all instruction that I received from General Lazarus Chair.    Chair I cannot rememberor recall the exact - the exact conversation but the instruction that he gave me was to deposit this money into - into this account.  The cheque was from General Mdluli.  It was his name pre-printed on the bottom of the cheque.  It was a blank cheque. General Lazarus himself filled in - I - I assumed this cheque would have been given to him by General Mdluli.    General Lazarus filled in the amount because it was a blank cheque Chair.    I proceeded to - I think it is an Absa Bank Chair and I made the deposit.  I think the deposit slip is - is annexed to my statement.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    R40 000,00.    Yes.    Chair if I can just make a correction quickly.    When I said the amountof 40 000 the amount was already written in by General Mdluli …    But where you had to write physically the amount in words that was written by General Lazarus.    That is correct Chair.    The words were written in by General Lazarus.    That is what I …    (No audible reply).    Chair it was blank Chair at that stage.  There was nothing written in - in the cheque when he    No Chair.  General Mdluli handed the cheque over to General Lazarus and General Lazarus subsequently gave me the instruction to - to make the deposit.  The actual writing of the - the amount in words was done by General Lazarus.    In figures Chair.  That is what …    That is correct.    Yes Chair.    Hm.    No Chair.    That is correct Chair.    When I said it was blank Chair I meant that - I was referring to the words.  The words were not written in but the amount was written in.    There was no - the - the space where you have to write out the amount that was blank.    Very clear Chair.    Chair if I …    If I may Chair let me clarify.    Okay Chair.  That - that would not be very clear because that was his cheque with his pre-printed name at the bottom.  So I am assuming that figure was written in by General Mdluli.    But what - what I can confirm is that that was a cheque by General Mdluli because his name was pre-printed on the bottom.    The figure.  I will - I will stay away from that.    I am not sure.    I will stay away from that Chair.    My apologies.    Chair this advance was taken on my name Chair.  This was an instruction of General Lazarus.    It was General Lazarus.  Chair this was an instruction like I said from General Lazarus.  This was the cash amount of 30 000.  When he further instructed me to take the cheque togetherwith the cash of R30 000,00 that he had just approved and deposit into this account of Karin Hanekom Attorneys.    Yes.    That is correct.    Chair that is my writing.  That is correct.    Indeed.  Chair as I testified to previously.  A safe house was being rented or General Mdluli’s safe house was being rented by Crime Intelligence.  When I met General Mdluli a week or two after taking this advance I suggested to him that I pay off this outstanding advance of R30 000,00 on my name if I could with his permission use the money from - from the premises which was R7 000,00 to pay off this outstanding advance on my name. He agreed Chair.  I also relayed this message or ratherrelayed this conversation that I had with General Mdluli to General Lazarus and they were both fine with that.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair this is simply - the R30 000,00 was a cash advance that I have taken from the Secret Service Account. The other R40 000,00 was the cheque.  I think the cheque - the cheque number is also on - on the deposit slip.  Where - where the other R30 000,00 is reflected Chair is merely a sub total    That is correct Chair.    No Chair.    Chair if - if I did it - it was a mistake on my part but the actual amount was R70 000,00.    Maybe I was referring to the cheque …    And not the cash.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    In the form of a cheque,yes.    Indeed.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.  It - it was probably a few weeks after this deposit was made and after the advance that I had taken on my name which was outstanding.  I - I suggested to General Mdluli that I could use the money that was - that he was collecting as rent from the property that CI was renting from him to pay off this advance. Chair I did this over - over a period of a few months where Iwould take the R7 000,00 and instead of giving it or - or handing it over to General Mdluli I would pay off the advance.  Although it would be a part payment of 7 000.  This I did over four months and I think the last payment was R2 000,00 Chair.  That is how this - that is how this advance was settled or reconciled.    Chair if - if I can just refresh.  I testified earlier that General Mdluli’s flat in Gordon’s Bay was being rented by CI …    And on a monthly basis I would collect the cash from Mr John Appalsamy from Daez Trading …    And hand over the cashto General Mdluli.    This was on a monthly basis.    When I took this advance Chair to pay the attorneys this was outstanding.  I could not reconcile this advance.    I then suggested toGeneral Mdluli if I could with his permission the money that I collected from Mr - Mr John Appalsamy for his property with regards to the rent the R7 000,00 if I could pay it off each month against this outstanding R30 000,00.  He agreed Chair.  This was done over a few - a few months until this advance was paid off.    That is correct Chair.  Over a period of five months.    That is correct Chair.  Yes.    Chair, K - regarding Upgrading of CI Members Properties.  I am going to skip this section as well because all of this was conversations or general conversations that I had with various members of Crime Intelligence and I picked up these things.  So I am going to skip this Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  Chair if I may.    There is just one aspect where I have personal knowledge …    And I refer to - still under    Chair this was my own property.    This was a period when General Lazarus was busy renovating his home Chair.  There was a period I think of two or three weeks where there was down time for the renovations at his property.  He said to me that - I think he gave me a cheque.  No he did give me a cheque.  I remember clearly Chair.It was a cheque for R20 000,00.  He said that I should upgrade the property to my own house.  Well not the whole property.  It was a boundary wall and to replace the - the driveway gate.    And this was an amount of R20 000,00 Chair.    Chair it was a cheque that he had given.  It was cash but he did mention to me that he would sort it out with Deena.  Dina referring to Major-General Deena Moodley who was a Crime Intelligence Head KwaZulu-Natal at that stage.    Chair again this would be    But I can provide more details further to this.    At a later stage, yes.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   That is correct Chair and replacing the driveway gate.    That is correct Chair.    It was his own cheque Chair, yes.    Chair …    Chair my understanding of that …    Would be indeed Crime Intelligence money but like I said I cannot delve into that …    Further.CHAIRPERSON   It is as far as I can take it.  No Chair.It was R20 000,00 Chair.    That is correct.  Chair I must also mention if I may that amount was never paid back to General Lazarus    No Chair.    (No audible reply).    Chair I am not aware of …    Of that annexure.  I amnot sure if it is here.  Chair, he - he - General Lazarus was renovating his own property around 2006/2007.  So it would have been probably in the same - in the same timeframe.    Chair, I am going to skipthat as well.  It is also hearsay.  This was through general conversation that I had.    Hm.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Up to 170.    Ja.    From …    No Chair.  It would go to - from 168 to 172.5.    Yes Chair.    Chair this is in reference to the Mdluli family one point - 173 Chair.    I was in charge of these seven agents.  So I would ultimately take care of their petrol claimsregarding these vehicles Chair.    It was seven vehicles in total.  If I just may name then Chair.    One was a BMW 330 diesel - a sedan.  The second one was - and if I can just give the amount Chair.  The amount of R487 313,00 this was utilised by FM24.    The second vehicle Chair a Nissan Micra.  The amount for this particular vehicle was R127 000,00.  This was utilised by FM30.  The third vehicle Chair a VWGold 1.6 or rather VW Golf 6 1.4.  Utilised by FM25.  The amount Chair R220 365,00. Chair the fourth vehicle Chair a Honda Jazz 1.5.  Utilised by FM29.  The amount Chair R172 000,00.  The fifth vehicle Chair.  An Audi A4 2 litre utilised by FM28.  The amount R352 309,10.  The sixth vehicle Chair.  A VW Golf 6 1.4.  Utilised by FM27.  The amount of R221 376,00 and the last vehicle being the seventh one Chair. A VW Golf 6 GTi.  Utilised by FM26 and I do not see an amount.  The amount is unknown to me but I can confirm if the    That is …    That is correct.    Chair these are the instructions that I received from General Lazarus.  He also informed me that I would be responsible for these vehicles insofar as the claims in respect of each one of these vehicles.  Chair on a monthly basis Iwould receive petrol slips from these members and I would complete the necessary compilation of the claims. Chair being them as they were agents their daily trips were not logged.  Rather it was just an opening mileage for the month and a closing mileage at the end of the month.  So I had no idea where the vehicles were being utilised and for what purpose.    Chair these vehicles were delivered to, I am not sure if I can, I won’t mention he area w herethey were delivered to, but they were delivered to ...[intervenes]    As in 173 Chair yes.     That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    General Mdluli at that stage was a Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence so in terms of his rank I think he was – he had the authority to use this vehicle with an official driver.  Chair he also had a bodyguard but I am not sure if    And then I referred to a Mercedes Benz in 177.2, Chair this was a Mercedes Benz E350 CDI ...[intervenes]     Chair this is a vehicle he would have received when he was appointed, that was in July 2009.    Until the period of 2011,March thereabout where he was arrested.    This was his official vehicle.    No Chair.    Chair I am not sure exactly of the time frames but I would say at least three of those vehicles were used for his use at any given time.    Chair this vehicle waspurchased through funds from the Secret Service Account.    That is correct Chair.    This is – sorry Chair can I continue?    Chair as opposed to the first vehicle when I mentioned the Audi Q7 this was procured via the open account, the Mercedes and the rest that I mentioned is allprocured using funds from the Secret Service Account.    The first one a Mercedes E350 CDI this vehicle was purchased from Mercedes Benz Lifestyle Centre Menlyn, the amount being R636 950.  Chair however ...[intervenes]     That is correct Chair.    Secret Service Account Chair, that is correct.    Chair if I just may giveyou some insight regarding this particular vehicle.    General Mdluli initially he was happy with the vehicle Chair but a few months later he instructed General Lazarus to trade this type or this particular vehicle for another one.  Chair I was there when General Mdluli came to General Lazarus’ office, he gave General Lazarus a list of extras that this particular vehicle, and I am referring to the Mercedes Benz that did not have.  He wanted those extras to be installed on the Mercedes Benz.  Chair those extras only comes from the factory, subsequentlyanother Mercedes Benz, Chair if you look at 177.3 Mercedes Benz E-Class 350 CDI, Chair it is exactly the same vehicle, I am talking about now this is the second Mercedes Benz that was purchased for General Mdluli, it is exactly the same vehicle Chair, but if you look at the difference in the amount that was paid.    Yes Chair the first one was R636 950, I refer to the second one, this was R826 780,01.  Chair the difference between these two figures that I have just given was the extras that was fitted onto the next or the second Mercedes as per General Mdluli’s instruction to General Lazarus.    The next vehicle Chair is a BMW 530 Diesel Sedan, this vehicle was purchased from Nieuhaus, that is in Pretoria, the amount being R706 150, purchased by CompanyX.  Chair the next one a black Jeep, General Mdluli also made use of this vehicle Chair, however this was not purchased specifically for General Mdluli, this vehicle was previously utilised by Commission Mpego when he was the Divisional Commissioner.   When General Mdluli was appointed for a short period he made use of this vehicle.  Chair however he was not very happy with this vehicle and this vehicle was redirected to another Province, I think it was KZN.    Chair then I go to the    Secret Service Account, that is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair the black Jeep like I mentioned that was not purchased specifically for General Mdluli, it was a vehicle previously utilised by the then CI Head CommissionerMpego.  General Mdluli made use of this vehicle for a very short period Chair, a few months if I can remember correctly and it was redirected to another Province.    Chair the next vehicle a Lexus, this vehicle was initially purchased by Company X for General Ntwe Chair.  I will testify to this a little later on and give more detail but this vehicle also purchased initially for the intention to be given to General Ntwe, she did not like this vehicle so General Mdluli made use of this vehicle for a few months, no not a few months it was until hisarrest in 2011.  Chair all of these vehicles that I have referred to was my responsibility Chair, this was an instruction that was given to me by General Lazarus that I would be personally responsible.  Chair these claims were not done, as opposed to normal vehicles these claims were not done on a monthly basis.  Whenever I would get receipts from General Mdluli I would complete the logbooks or the petrol claim Chair.    That is correct Chair.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Not that I am aware of Chair.  Chair there is a possibility but it is going to b speculation so I would not speculate    Indeed Chair.    Sorry Ms Wentzel, please repeat?     No, not – no, no.    Chair pardon me, I didnot hear that Chair.    Oh sorry Chair.    Chair that would also be speculation, if somebody else within Crime Intelligence had indeed access to these vehicles there is a possibility that they could haveused the vehicles, put in petrol and done the claim separately to what I was received from General Mdluli in terms of the receipts, so there is a possibility yes.    Yes Chair this was a Mercedes Benz ML350.  This vehicle was purchased at Mercedes Benz Umhlanga Rocks or Umhlanga Chair.  The amount – this particular vehicle was R373 850.00 Chair.  Chair I have personal knowledge of this vehicle.    This was in – would probably be in 2009 or 2010 Chair.    That is correct Chair.    This vehicle was specifically purchased for use by the then Minister of Police MinisterNathi Mthethwa.  Chair it was myself and Colonel FM11 who delivered this vehicle to Minister Mthethwa’s residence in Pretoria.  This particular vehicle Chair that I refer to was registered in the name of FM11.    11.    Chair the Minister utilised this vehicle for a few months.  I remember this because General Mdluli when I met him at his office on one occasion heinstructed me to pick up the vehicle from the Minister’s house as the Minister informed him that he no longer wanted to make use of this vehicle as journalists were following him.  I remember Chair I spoke to FM11 to make arrangements for the vehicle to be fetched from Minister Mthethwa’s house.    That is correct Chair.  Purchased through Company X.    Chair all of these vehicles that I mentioned except the Audi Q7 were purchased withfunds from the Secret Service Account ultimately being Company X.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  He instructed me to retrieve the vehicle from the Minister’s house as the Minister no longer wanted to make use of that particular vehicle as he mentioned to General Mdluli that journalists were following him.  Ithereafter made arrangements with Colonel FM11 Chair to pick up the vehicle from the Minister’s house.  FM11 knew where the Minister’s house was because he had previously went there with me deliver the vehicle initially Chair.  This vehicle was…    Yes Chair I arranged with FM11 to drive the vehicle because he had not known at that stage where Minister Mthethwa stayed.  I did Chair because on previous – on a previous few occasions I had taken or driven General Mdluli there for a meeting that he was having with the Minister.  So I knew where the residence was.    No Chair I madearrangements with FM11 to fetch the vehicle from the Minister’s house.    Chair having been there the first time with me to deliver the vehicle yes he did know where the premises was.    Chair after FM11 collecting the vehicle from Minister Mthethwa the vehicle was parked at our vehicle store – when I say our it is CI vehicle store.  It was occasionally used by General Lazarus.  On at least one occasion weused this particular or he used this particular vehicle to Island Rock.  Chair this vehicle was thereafter driven to Cape Town.  It was utilised by General Mdluli.  If I am given to understand correctly I think this is the same vehicle that was – this was the vehicle that was registered in the name of FM24.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  Registered in the name of FM24.    Chair it would have been    Not more than a year.    That is correct Chair he was the Minister of Police.  In terms of him using a vehicle from Crime Intelligence I cannot be certain Chair.  I am not sure what the policy is.    Chair I cannot say exactly but it would not have been used extensively because it was just a few months.    So it would have been fairly – still fairly new.    General Mdluli said to me Solly you must buy this aunty a car.    Yes.    His name Solomon Lazarus.    Yes Chair.     Chair at that stage there was the relationship between – okay Chair sorry I am going to – I am going to not speak on that because it is speculation.  I am going to    What I can say is that at that stage General Nchwe was not employed at CI.  I think she was the Divisional Commissioner of Head of Human Resources at the SAPS.    She had no dealings with Crime Intelligence or rather she did have dealings with Crime Intelligence but she was not stationed at Crime Intelligence.  Chair what I can say further is that this particular vehicle was purchased for General Nchwe.  I together with FM02 who is actually a relative ofGeneral Lazarus.  FM02 Chair was at that stage living with General Lazarus at his house.  I got a call from General Lazarus.  He asked me to come to his home.  He further instructed me I – when I got there I saw this particular vehicle that I speak of Chair.  It was a – a white Audi Q5.  It was parked in his driveway.  He instructed me together with FM02 to take the vehicle and deliver it to General Nchwe.  This was at her residence in Bedfordview Chair.  I think it was Essex World.    FM02 drove the vehicle and I followed him to General Nchwe’s house.  Chair I met General Nchwe in her driveway and she personally took possession of this vehicle.  I handed over the keys.  At that stage the vehicle had – had been – it was not registered Chair.  It had those temporary plates.  I also remember very clearly Chair.    I also remember on that particular date when I delivered this vehicle it was parked on a driveway not on the roadside.    Chair and she said to me – are you just going to – before I left after handing the keys over to her.  She said to me – are you going to park the – you just going to    So I was not really sure what she meant by that because the vehicle was parked inside her property on the driveway.    So I really do not know what she meant by that.    Nevertheless I did not pay much attention to that Chair.  The vehicle like I mentioned had temporary plates.    In her driveway at her premises Chair.    On General Nchwe’s name.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Chair if I – still on 182 asyou referred.  If I can just correct?  This is incorrect Chair.  If I can just rectify that?    It was not General Lazarus who informed me that General Mdluli buy a vehicle for General Nchwe.  I informed General Lazarus of this – of this arrangement.    Yes Chair.  After – after – as I have testified already.  After dropping General Mdluli off from thismeeting that he had with General Nchwe and after having that discussion with me regarding the purchase of this vehicle for General Nchwe I – I informed General Lazarus about what the contents of the discussion I had with Mr Mdluli.  But I informed him also that General Mdluli will speak to him further when he sees him.    Chair not General Mdluli between General Lazarus and General Nchwe.  But also I am going to stray away from that Chair because that is an assumption.  Because this was a time when the post – the 250 posts were – were in the process of being concluded.      Chair what I am going to – what I am sure of is that the conversation that I had with General Mdluli regarding the purchase of the said vehicle for General Nchwe but I will stay away from the assumption that there was bad blood.    Yes Chair.    That – that would delve directly on – on what I said …    That I need to stray away from.    So I cannot go further than that Chair.    In terms of the reasoning behind the purchase.    Chair this vehicle was registered as an asset against my name Chair.  But it was not actually registered as an Audi Q4 Chair it was registered as an Audi A4.  This was intentionally done as to not attract any attention to the relevant people who would be auditing CI books.  This instruction or this arrangement was told to me By Colonel Barnard.    That is correct Chair.    That is indeed the vehicle that I delivered to General Nchwe.    The true identity of that vehicle was misrepresented Chair.  It was not an Audi Q4 but it was captured as an Audi A4.    That is correct.  This was    Because Chair at that stage this was quite an extravagant vehicle for me to drive as a Lieutenant Colonel.    That is correct Chair.    This was done by ColonelBarnard Chair.    Yes Chair.    Colonel Barnard Chair at that stage was the Head of …    The Procurement Section at CI.    That is correct Chair.    I am not sure Chair.    Chair he would – he definitely would have known because the suggestion came from him.    That is correct Chair.    That is indeed correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  What I can say with regards to what you just mentioned.  Although the said vehicle was allocated on my name on the CI Register. Chair from the time thatthis vehicle was purchased and subsequently handed over to General Nchwe up until the time that I was admitted into the witness protection program I had not received a single receipt in terms of petrol slips or any other receipts regarding this vehicle Chair.  So basically there was – there would be no claims posted against this vehicle in the timeframe that I mentioned because I had never received any – any receipts.    The petrol slip – thepetrol…    The petrol slip no Chair because that would just be a normal petrol slip that you would fill in any other vehicle.    But in terms of this vehicle being registered on the system it would have been allocated a SR number.    So if one had to punch in that asset or rather sorry SR number it would come up as an Audi A4 and not an Audi Q5.    Chair when the initial – when the initial change was made as to disguise the true identity of this vehicle.    Once it was captured on the system as an A4…    Wherever you go in any –    Exactly.    Chair there would have been queries and I had a few – at a later stage or a few months later I did this – I did bring this to the attention of General Lazarus and informed him that – that I was – there was nothing forthcoming from General Nchwe with regards to any expenses with respect to this vehicle.  Chair General Lazarus instructed me to contact General Nchwe to enquire from her as to what the position was in terms of the cost – in terms of petrol etcetera.  Chair I never got around to meeting General Nchwe I was subsequently admitted into the witness protectionprogram.  So I do not know what became of this vehicle in terms of – or physically where it is now or any expenses related to this vehicle.    That is correct Chair.    From my knowledge I do not have any documents regarding this vehicle.    Except that it was registered on her name.    That is correct Chair.    Chair yes I did.  I remember on one occasion I accompanied FM11 Chair to deliver an i-pad to General Nchwe at this residence that I speak of.  Essex World Bedfordview.  Chair at that stage she had already received her vehicle.  And General Nchwe did not give me any documents regarding this specific vehicle.  Be it like you mentioned if it was serviced or any petrol receipts.    Chair yes I did.  There were security upgrades that were carried at General Nchwe’s house.  So I did go there at least one other occasion apart from - from delivering the vehicle and accompany FM11 to deliver the iPad.  At least one other time apart from these two occasions. Chair I will testify to that later with regards to the upgrades.  It is further in my statement - further down in my statement.    I am not sure where that instruction came from.  It would have probably come from either General Mdluli or General Lazarus.    To General Nchwe.    That is correct Chair.    I am not certain if I did.  I am not sure if this particular purchase order was shown to me by Colonel Roelofse.    Yes.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL Chair this - these documents would have been shown to me by Colonel Roelofse during his investigations into Crime Intelligence.    It is fine Chair we can continue.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Chair I will - I will not deal with this matter.    As it is also hearsay.  It was told to me by FM08.  So I will not deal with this matter.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Chair General Lazarus kept a pool of SR vehicles at our store - CI store.  Namely a Mercedes Viano, VW Caravelle, Nissan Pathfinder and a Nissan King Cab which was used exclusively by General Lazarus and those close to him including myself Chair.    Most of these vehicles were used to Island Rock.  Like I mentioned earlier Chair Island Rock was not accessible with an ordinary vehicle.  It needed a 4 X 4 to get there.    So these vehicles wouldoften be used for these trips and any other trip that General Lazarus undertook.  So basically these vehicles were parked - when it was - was parked in the store when it was not been utilised by either General Lazarus or those close to him.    Yes.  I did.  Chair is it - is it possible if I can just take a five minute break?    That is fine Chair.  Thank you.    Thank you Chair.     Yes I am Chair, Chair if Imay just a humble request Chair, I asked for a break earlier just to stretch my legs and walk around, I am getting cramps in my legs Chair.    Chair if I can request if we can continue tomorrow Chair, I am just battling to sit with my legs cramping and it is also quite warm in here where I am Chair.    Thank you Chair for accommodating my request. 
 COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
NAIDOO:  And nearing its completion it was furnished by using funds from the Secret Service Account.
