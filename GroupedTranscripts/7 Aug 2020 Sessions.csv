CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.      Good morning.  Are we ready?    Yes please administer the oath or affirmation    Thank you.  You may be seated Mr Manyike.    The affidavit of Mr Abel Kgotso Manyike appearing at page 121 of Bundle FS1 is admitted as Exhibit TT4.    That is a much better formulation Mr Pretorius than the one you nearly used for that question.    Yes.  I am saying that is a better formulation of that question the way you have put it than the one that you nearly used.  I think you started and on the way you changed.    I think it – the latest formulation of the question enables him to just tell the story.   Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    Ja.    Did you say FS8 Mr Pretorius?    Okay.    Did you give Mr Manyike the right one?  FS8.  This is FS1.    One second Mr Pretorius.  Mr Pretorius it looks like my staff did not bring the particular bundle but you might be able to just read aloud the relevant portions.  Somebody will go back and fetch it in the meantime.    That is fine.  Ja that is fine if you are able to.  Ja.  I think they brought some and they seem to have left either that one or two bundles.  Thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Are you still at 2?    Oh, okay.    I see it, yes.    Yes.    Now, Mr Manyike.  You had done this type of work before your company, had you not?   You had done this type of work before?    Before this project?    How long had your company been involved in this type of work?  How many years, more or less?    Yes.    Okay.    Yes, okay.   Yes.    But are you able to indicate whether it was the second project you were involved in, involved in this type of work, or third or fourth project?    Yes.    Now in terms of this scope of work andwhat you charged, you said that was... I think you said that was enough for this kind of work.  Is that consistent with the prices that you have charged in other projects, the pricing?  Was it consistent in terms of the prices?    Or are you not able to say?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, the main contractors.    Ja, of their amount.    Ja.  Yes.   Yes, yes.  So you consider it reasonable?    Yes, okay.  Yes, Mr Pretorius.     The contractors charge.    But would it be correct to say?  The bottomline is, if the Free State Department of Human Settlements had invited bids openly, you could have put in a bid to do the job and that what you would have charged may well have been exactly what you charged to do this job?  Would it be correct to say that?      Or is the position that if you had been the main contractor you would also have charged maybe R 250 million?    Yes?    Well, from what you say.  You would havethe resources other than the, what you referred to as financial muscle, to do the job, you would have the resources.  Is that correct?  What you would not have is what you call the financial muscle.    But in terms of other resources, you would have what would be needed to do the project?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Oh, that... that is what... is that what... would that be the kind of money that the government would say you must put down to ensure ...[intervenes]     Ja.  But that would be money that will come back to you when everything is finalised?    Yes, it is just giving it.   Yes.  But apart from that, that requirement, you would have... you would meet every requirement to do the job?    As far as you know?    Yes, yes.  Now if they did not require that down payment of millions of rands of if you had a way of getting somebody that would partner with you and you are bidding for this, exactly this job with the scope of work, what do you think your price would have been, bearing in mind what you charged for the whole work, bearing in mind what the main contractor charged the department?    Ja.    So it would then be up to the Free State Department whether it accepts that ...[intervenes]     Ja, but if effectively the... since, I think you said, there are not too many of these jobs.  If the department said that was in Gauteng, this is Free State.  We think you got away with murder in Gauteng.  You have got to go down on your price here.  You will be able to go down quite considerable, is it not, and still make a good profit?    You would not want to lose that job when you know that you can do the job for much less and still make a good profit.    H’m?    By the department... by the governmentdepartment?    Oh, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    But if you... if your company... if a number of companies had put in the bids and your company provided... gave the cheapest price, okay?   Go back to the others.  But your cheapest price, they thought it was still quite high because you businesspeople robbed Gauteng.  You all [laughs] conspired and put your prices up, you know.  Now you want to use that as a base to rob everybody else.  They say, “Look, Mr Manyike, you are the cheapest of this, so that is why we will talk to you.  But even your price is unrealistic because if you charge us half of what you have put in here, you still make a goodprofit.  We do not want to give you this job if you stick to this amount.  We want you to go lower.  The economic times are difficult”.  When you know you can still go down and still make a good profit, would you not take the job, would you not reduce it?    You will reduce it, ja.    Ja, because where else are you going to get another job?      How long must you wait?    Ja.   Okay.  Alright.  Mr Pretorius.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Ja. [laughs]    No, I... [laughs]  I think you are right toremind us about your sensitivities Mr Manyike.    Mr Pretorius.    I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Did you say you did provide that or did you say you did not provide that?    You did.    Alright.  Okay.    I see that at the top, the document says, “letter of commitment”.  Is that the letter ...[intervenes]   The ORI Group committed itself to performing the work in terms of this appointment?    Okay.     Hang on, Mr Pretorius, are you taking us back to his affidavit?     That is in bundle FS1.     Oh, they did not – they should have provided you with water there.  Well, maybe we should take the tea break but somebody must make sure there is always water available to the witness.  Oh, is there bottle of water available?  They will bring you water just now.  Thank you.  Maybe let us use the five minutes before we take the tea break.     Yes.     Ja, that is the one referred to in paragraph 32.     Oh, you said – you referred to SI?     Is that the SIU?     Oh, when they came to interview.     You say they had certain affidavits from this case?     Yes.     Ja.     Oh.     Yes, yes.  You suspect that certain affidavits that should have been in the file may no longer be there?    Okay, is that something that you discussed with SIU or you did not discuss?     Oh, okay, okay.  Okay and you have a feeling that those affidavits may well assist the Commission in understanding certain things?  Well, the investigators of the Commission are here, they will look into that and we will be informed.  Thank you for bringing that to our attention.     Maybe we should take the adjournment the?     We will take the tea adjournment now and resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNSINQUIRY RESUMES     Let us continue.     I am sorry, I think – are you speaking to Mr Manyike?     Oh, you are saying you have found the page.  Ja, okay.     What is it, Mr Pretorius?    Okay.     We had an expert here, Mr Roets, who said that that is not really a reliable way of finally determining whether a house has an asbestos roof or not.     I am sorry, you are author of…?    Yes.     Maybe before you go there, Manyike.     He certainly gave evidence about auditing and assessment.  Auditing is certainly, as Iunderstand it, or is certainly what was included in the mandate in this project, is it not?  The assessment, we can talk about because certainly auditing was auditing of the houses for asbestos.     H’m?     H’m?     Yes, no, no, no, let us – we will get to know when an expert comes but let us take it step by step.  You agree with me that auditing the houses for asbestos was one – was part of a mandate given to the main contractor by the Human Settlements Department in the Free State .     You agree?    Ja and you also agree that the auditing, that part of the job, auditing houses for asbestos meant actually establishing how many houses had asbestos, is that correct?     Yes.  On assessment, what is your understanding with regard to whether assessment was part of the mandate given to the main contractor by the Human Settlements Department in this project?  Was it part of it or was it not part of it, as you understood it?     Ja, no, no, that is fine.    Ja.     Ja.     Yes, okay, we will come to that, I just want to establish that we are all on the same page on certain things.  With regard to the assessment, what is your understanding of what assessment entails in this context?     Or this kind of project of finding asbestos.    I am sorry just repeat that, I think it is important, the answer is …[intervenes]     Yes, yes.     Let me tell you what my understanding was of what he said assessment entails and I just want to check whether it coincides with your understanding or not.My understanding of what he said assessment entails is that you cannot just do it standing outside the house or standing on the road looking at the house in order to do it properly you have got to get into the house, see where exactly you see asbestos, that is my understanding, it might be wrong, so where you can pick up where asbestos is and, as I understand what you are saying,some houses that have got asbestos might be – their condition might be such that they need to be given priority in terms of removing the roof or even demolishing the house because as a result of the asbestos in the house there is danger of the occupants of the house, there is greater danger in regard to some houses than in regard to other houses.So I got the impression that part of the assessment is to see which houses must government give priority because already people live in that house are in danger, they could be injured and he said – and it is not just in the roof, I think it is elsewhere as well in the house.  That was my understanding.  If that is my understanding and if that is what he said, does it accord with your understanding of assessment?    It does not?     Your understanding of assessment does not entail – does not make it necessary that you should go into the house, is that right?     Does not, ja. MR     Whatever you want to see you can see from outside the house?     So what are the potential things you look for standing outside the house when you are assessing on your understanding?     Oh, is that the roof or …[intervenes]     The roof, ja.     This is now inside the house?     So sometimes you can do it without going into the house, sometimes you have to go into thehouse.     Okay.     Yes but let me just go back from the assessment part, is it simply to see whether this house has got asbestos on your understanding of assessment.  So when the person – when you send your fieldworker or someone there, is it to look for indications where there is asbestos?     Ja, that is the audit part.     Ja.     Ja.     What is the situation, what is the impact of a house that is plastered on your assessment?     does it mean it is difficult to assess or is it easy or…?     Yes.     Ja.     When you talk about remove the geyser, you are not talking about the person who is coming to make the assessment, you talk about later.     Ja.     Whoever…     Okay.     And it adds to the cost.     Yes, but just to go back, you said the assessment relates to – I think did you say physical integrity of the house?     Yes.  I understand that to mean whether the house looks like it might collapse anytime or in duecourse.  Is that what it means, the physical integrity of the house?     When you – for purposes of an assessment done in the context of this project, does it matter whether the cause or the house to be like that, namely, it looks like it might be collapse anytime or it might collapse in six months, does it matter whether that might have been caused by asbestos or it does not matter what has caused that condition to happen for purposes of the assessment?  So, in other words, are you only looking for what damage the asbestos has done to the physical integrity of the house or are you just looking at the physical integrity of the house irrespective of what has caused this?    Well, I must confess that thought came to my mind.  It may be ignorance to say …[intervenes]     Why can you not just get councillors who are paid to look after the interests of the community to …[intervenes]     Yes.     It would not…     Ja, they must be trained to do it, ja.     But I am correct then to understand that what you are saying is that the assessment part of the job required or requires a contractor such as yourself to have somebody who goes to the house but does not need to enter the house but must see the house and in seeing the house, must look at what the state of the condition of the physical integrity of the house is.     And then make a note of what they observed.    And that the condition of the physical integrity of the house does not have to be connected to damage caused by asbestos.     It is simply the condition of the house, the physical integrity of the house irrespective of what has caused it.     Yes.  And that sums up the gist of yourunderstanding of what assessment in this context means.      Okay.  Mr Pretorius?     I think somebody of the Commission staff must give Mr Manyike another bottle of water, I think he is running out of water.  Yes, okay, let us continue.     What page Mr Pretorius?     Okay.     So anything outside the R33million was expenses that you were going to incur in order to carry out the order?     In terms of expertise and experience andknowledge of doing this kind of work, do you know whether MasterTrade had that?     I can put it differently and say why did they need you?      Yes.     Why would they not been able to render that service?     They do not have that expertise?     And how long have you known them or have you had interactions with them MasterTrade?     Oh I am sorry, for how long have you known them MasterTrade, how long have you known them or interacted with them in projects?     So it has been a business relationship?     Ja, ja.     So but you say you have dealt with them with for this kind of job they did not have the expertise and that is why they needed you.     Yes.     But tell me about this role of social facilitator.  Do you know - are there quite a few of people who play that role in regard to government work tenders and so on of people who play that role and get paid money?     Well it is very – it sounds very strange to me I mean if there is a bridge to be built there is a road to be built it might be other things other than asbestosprojects.  The politicians you know the government officials should be the ones telling the public what is happening.  Why should there be people who add millions of rand’s or playing this social role but who are not actually doing the work.      Yes.     Yes…[intervenes]        If we need an engineer, we need whoever to build a bridge or build a road those are the people we need and then government must appoint those people and they do that.  Why do you need anybody else if you need to tell the committee what is happening the government department, the officials in the government departments and the politicians can tell the community.     Ja, ja.     To stop fighting about this project.     Who make demands…     There is some people may be making all kinds of demands which have got no basis and they should be dealt with by government but now government must appoint other people and pay them millions to sort out that problem.  Okay I guess Mr Manyike some of the things I am asking you are things that you know you might not be able to answer you know nothing about.  You just telling me what your experience is and what you have observed.     Yes, okay.       But on the ground in terms of the work being done you are not able to say you know what he did, whatever he did would not have been on the ground.      Yes, no what Mr Pretorius means issimply that the R147,00 is substantially much less than the R800,00 and something a house that had been quoted by the joint venture to the department.     Ja.     I am sorry I missed that.     Yes.     Oh okay.       I see Mr Pretorius that we do actually have two paragraphs 58 with two paragraphs 58.  The one you were referring to is the second one the other one was supposed to have been 57 ne, the one that had sub-paragraphs?  Ja, so any reference in the transcript to the earlier paragraph 58.1 on one or whatever that is the first 58, the second 58 is at page 137 that is the one where Mr Manyike says I am aware that the joint venture had other professional’s blah, blah.ADV PRETORIUS     Ja, but I just want to…[intervenes]        Ja.     I see that there is paragraph 57 coming after the second paragraph 58.    Oh there is actually a third oh ja you, okay.      Maybe in the meantime while Mr Pretorius is preparing his next question can you just tell me again, I think I asked you this question but I am not sure that I remember what your answer was.  What thesignificance was of the field workers noting whether the house was done or not.  What is the significance of whether a house is plastered or not in this context?     Okay.     Yes, okay, okay.  Yes, Mr Pretorius.     That is bundle FS8?     Just repeat the page number Mr Pretorius.   270.    What is the page on Bundle FS9?    Hm.   Okay.    By reason of the fact that generally speaking your field workers would not enter the house butyou did say that sometimes they would.  But by reason of the fact that generally they would not would you agree that as far as the physical integrity of structural integrity of the house is concerned if there were serious cracks inside the house on the walls for example that would therefore mean that as long as they were – they did not show outside they would not be picked up by the field workers?    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Okay.      You do wish?    Okay alright before you do so let me say that there might need to be a further exercise to be done in terms of which Mr Manyike maybe has full access to what Mr Roets said so that – and what he was basing his evidence on so that Mr Manyike may look at that properly and maybe be able to – to comment properly.  Because I heard that heseems to think that the report or the documents he was referring to they might – there might be something wrong with them or whatever or they might not have been adequate to enable him to express any opinion, that kind of thing and then maybe it is fair that that should happen because  1. Effectively Mr Roets was critical of the work that was done and 2. Mr Manyike also is critical of at least certain aspects of the evidence of Mr Roets so that in due course we can reach a point where we know exactly what each one of them has to say about the relevant issues.    Yes it might be…    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.  Mr Manyike you have heard what I have said.  Another opportunity may be given to you after you have had an opportunity to look at his evidence – Mr Roets’ evidence properly.  Look at exactly what documents he was basing his evidence on and then comment properly on it maybe by way of an affidavit initially and if necessary, you come back and comment on it properly.  When Mr Roets finished his evidence also earlier this week I did say to him he needed to identify what documents he might not have been given which would be important for – for his use and it was contemplated that possibly later on he would provide another affidavit where he would be able to say, I have now been given everything that I think I should have been given to be able to give an opinion and I stay with your opinionthat I expressed earlier on or I am qualifying it because of – of what I have now seen.  Or I give a completely different opinion in the light of what I have seen.  So that process will happen with him as well.  And it may well be that he might be asked to come back as well.  In the light of whatever criticism of his evidence you might have so that all of – that may be tested.  So – so in the light of that would you still like to say something now or would you prefer to have another chance to say something after you have looked at everything?   Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Bring your microphone closer to you so I can hear.   Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no I think that is a fair point.  Purely from the point that I said to Mr Roets because I saw in his own statement that he indicated this is what I am basing this on what I have been given.  And I got the impression that he might have wished to have been given more.  So that is why I said he should identify what is that he was not given thathe would like to have.  And I think based on what you are saying you yourself are saying if the commission wishes to have any documents from you that he wishes to look at you are – you are open to make that available so that you can all speak from – on the same page.    Ja.      Okay alright.    Yes that is fine.    Which bundle?    Bundle FS1    Now you have got it.    Yes okay.    These costs?    Yes.    Yes.  So these costs were not incurred.    By MasterTrade it is not true?    Ja okay.  Are you done Mr Pretorius?    Yes.  Can I release Mr Manyike?    Yes we are done.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Thank you very much Mr Manyike for coming to the commission to assist the commission.We appreciate it very much and the commission will be in touch with you to do the further exercise and maybe there would be a need for you to come back but then you will be contacted.  Okay thank you.  We are going to take the lunch adjournment now and we willresume at – it is now eight minutes past one we will resume at ten past two.  We adjourn.    Are you ready, Mr Pretorius?    Yes.    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    Oh, I am sorry.  They did not sanitise for you.    I think they will sanitise.  Otherwise, you can address me from where you were if that is more convenient but I think they sanitise immediately.  Oh, okay.  Or even from where you were seated.  Where is the sanitiser and everything now?    Yes.   Oh, okay.    Yes.    I am sorry.  I think from where you are, I am struggling to hear.  Maybe because of the noise.  Let them finish sanitising there.  Then I think I will hear then better from there.    Yes.    Now I can hear you quite well.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    I have flexibility on my side.  If we gobeyond four o’clock, five o’clock, I am quite happy to go to see... I can go to seven but also it depends if we are not going to finish and even with those additional hours, then it will be necessary to come back.  Then we could look at that at four o’clock or five o’clock    And... but if there is preference that we try and finish today, from my side I certainly can go even up to seven.  Ja.    Yes, okay.  Okay.      Well, before you go.  I just want to mention something.  I certainly have not heard or I do not remember that I have had any complaint of no cooperation from Mr Sodi or his lawyers recently.  But last year, in the second half of the year, I have had some complaints and the complaints were along the lines that while there had been cooperation in arranging interviews and so on.And there were delays in the furnishing of his affidavits or statements despite certain undertaking having been made in terms of deadlines.  I do recall that.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  So I just wanted to say ...[intervenes]    ...that there was some but I have not heard of any difficulty in cooperation recently.    Ja.  Thank you very much.    Thank you.  We should have the oath administered now, hey?    Or affirmation.    Thank you.  I hope the transcribers heard the last part from Mr Sodi “so help me God”.  It was quite soft.      They heard?  Okay.  Mr Pretorius, you may proceed.    Of the same bundle?    Page 502?    Of...?    Okay.    You have got it?    You did explain to him the black numbers and red numbers Mr Pretorius.    I am wondering whether ...[intervenes]     Five zero two.  I think you just said five zero two.    Oh.    Oh.    Well, do you want me to finish with thisone first?  The second one or do you want us start with the first one?    Ja, that is what I want to do formally first.    The affidavit of mister... Is it Feane or Peane?    Peane?    Okay thank you.  The affidavit of Mr Peane Edwin Sodi deposed to on the 4 t h of August 2020 and appearing at page 502 will be admitted and marked Exhibit TT8 you said?   Two?  Oh, not 8.2?    Oh, TT2.  Okay it will be Exhibit TT2.    H’m?    Ja, I thought that is what I had heard.  Eight... so that affidavit will be admitted and marked ExhibitTT8.2.   FIRST AFFIDAVIT OF MR EDWIN SODI IS HANDED UP AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT TT8.2    Okay?    Yes?    The affidavit of Mr Peane Edwin Sodi appearing at page 375 will be admitted and marked as Exhibit TT8.1. SECOND AFFIDAVIT OF MR EDWIN SODI IS HANDED UP AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT TT8.1    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi, will you go toyour first affidavit at page 375 of FS1?    I am sorry, Mr Sodi.    The noise of the heater or aircon makes it really a bit difficult to... I do not know if it is making warm... making it warm but ...[intervenes]     Ja.  [laughs]  Then they must switch if off if it makes it cold.  But you could speak closer to the mic as well.   Yes, please just ...[intervenes]     Have you got it?    The subject of that letter is the request for appointment on Risk, Audit and Assessment, handling ofhazardous materials, removal and deposal of asbestos, contaminated rubble in the Free State Province.    Do you agree that even before you read the letter, reading that subject, tells you that the writer of this letter is requesting to be appointed to do all the things that are mentioned there?    You agree with that?    Okay.  Then you begin the letter.  You say   Yes.    Now, how... now you have said that yourcompany did not have the accreditation and, in fact, I think you went further to say even the skills, the skill or expertise to do the handling and disposal of asbestos sheets to an approved or designated disposal site.  Alright.     Alright now why do you ask the department to appoint you to do something that you know you do not have the expertise to do and that you know you do not have the accreditation to do and you know that you would need accreditation to do?    Well, that is a later question.     The first question is you are asking the department to appoint you to do something that you yourself admit you have no expertise to do.    That you yourself admit you need accreditation to do.     And you yourself admit you do not have accreditation.  My question is, why do you ask the department to appoint you to do something that you do not have the expertise to do, you know requires accreditation, you know you do not have accreditation formally.     And it is …[intervenes]     Because it is misrepresentation, is it not?     Yes, yes.    And did, as far as you know, do you know whether the department knew that for a service provider to handle and dispose of asbestos sheets they needed a service provider that would need to be accredited and so on, is that something you know whether they know themselves or whether they got to know?     You do not know.     Yes.  But you obviously must see the seriousness of this kind of misrepresentation.     Particularly because you would know that quite often in the country there are complaints that government departments give work to entities that have no experience, have got no knowledge.     Of how to do the job.     The next thing, they just take the money and go away, the job has not been done.     And for that reason, it is critical that no service provider should misrepresent what it can do andwhat it can do in terms of its skills, its capacity and its accreditation.       Yes.     Yes and then, of course, the point that you alluded to earlier on then arises, you know, why should a government department appoint a service provider who does not have the skills, the experience and knowledge of how to do the job.    On the basis that they go and find somebody else.     Rather than appoint the entity that has got all of that.     And then, if they say in order to transfer skills, in order to promote transformation, we would like you to work with another service provider.     That I can understand but where the service provider that is appointed is the one that does not have any skills, does not have any knowledge of the job and they are required to go and find  - I have difficulty with that.    Maybe you might be able to assist me.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.     Ja, that is what Mr Manyike said, ja.     Of course the proper way to do this is that you should have disclosed to the department that the skills or experience that you have relates to assessment and audit but that as for – as the handling and disposal of asbestos sheets is concerned you had a plan how to deal with that, namely …[intervenes]     …we do not have the skills but this is what we will do in order to carry out the job properly.  That would have been the proper way.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Of course, what I also note is that you letter is date 28 May 2014.     And the service agreement is dated …[intervenes]     Towards the end of the year.     Which suggests to me that would have given you time to reflect and say you know what, what we said to the department is not true, maybe we should correct it.  Well, I am just mentioning that that is what is my mind as I see this.     To say there was enough time to reflect on it.     And correct it but it seems it was repeated in the service agreement.     Okay.  Mr Pretorius?     What page Mr Pretorius?     466.     Okay.     Definition of project at the end of definitions, 1.1 at the end of it, there is the definition of projects there.  Can you see it?  Below payment of services.     Repeat the question, Mr Pretorius.     One, it certainly did not happen with you but you do not know whether your late partner had such a discussion.     Before Mr Pretorius asks the next question what was the initial amount based on, that of 1 350,  what was it based on?  There seems to be quite a big difference …[intervenes]     and 800 and something.     Yes.     And I will be very brief, I do not want to waste anyone’s time on this.     Yes, no that is fine, ja.     Yes, I think I have heard that part of the background.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Ja.     They said do not come back and say you need what?     Oh, amend, ja okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Oh, okay, okay.     Okay, okay.     So they determined it unilaterally, as it were, is that correct?  And was that rate 1 300 and …[intervenes]     How much?    Oh, okay, okay.     Yes.     Yes, okay.     Yes, I do not want you to take too long.     Then you quote a rate that is about double in the Free State, what is – why did you make it double to the – double the rate of Gauteng?     So basically, it was the experience you have had in Gauteng and bearing in mind the scope or thearea you had to cover in the Free State.     Okay.  Mr Pretorius?     Bundle FS8.     I must say, Mr Sodi, each time I see where you refer to the removal and disposal of the asbestos I keep on saying but why are you saying this when you know you cannot do it.    I know we have dealt with it but I am just letting you know each time I see it because I see here you have made it clear the door to door assessment will be R1 350 per house excluding VAT.   So that you know you can do.     Then you say removal and disposal to an approved designated site R32 760 excluding VAT.  So as I read it I say but he knows that they cannot do that, why ishe saying [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Okay, no that is fine.  Mr Pretorius continue.     I am sorry, I am also trying to follow, areyou on another bundle now?     That is FS1?  That is the bundle we had earlier.     Yes.     Yes, that is where 4.2 is.     You had asked a question, Mr Pretorius.     Do you want to share with me what document you are looking for, I might have seen it.     Which says what?     It is at 468, page 468, black numbers.  Mr Sodi and I have found the page.     And just to complete something that you said earlier on, the rate that was ultimately agreed upon, per house, did you say that came from the Department because you had quoted a higher amount?     Okay.     I take it that the department, as far as you know, never asked the joint venture, before appointing it to produce documentation to show that they have the expertise and the skills necessary to do the handling and disposal of the asbestos, as far as you know?    Of course, I haven’t checked throughout, but it doesn’t look like the Service Level Agreement talks about phase 1 and phase 2, is that right or does it?  ThisService Level Agreement I haven’t checked whether it does talk about phase and phase 2 of the project…[intervenes].     It may, it may not?     Okay, alright, thank you Mr Pretorius?     Yes, so probably – well certainly there’s no definition of phase 1 and phase 2.     And the project for which the joint venture was appointed was the entire project.     Ja, okay, alright…[intervenes].     You accept that the project for which you were appointed as the joint venture was the entire project?     You don’t accept it?     Okay, no, no that’s fine.  Let’s take it step by step.  As far as the Service Level Agreement, do you accept that your appointment was in respect of the whole project?  Yes but you are saying there’s something else which suggests otherwise?     Okay, alright.     Yes. MR     Ja you are giving your understanding?     Okay.     I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, I missed that, is it another Bundle we are looking at?     I’m sorry, 377?     Okay, alright continue.     Maybe I can say this Mr Sodi, it’s correct, I guess you admit, that the Free State SLA Agreement didn’t contain anything else like this but when you answer the way you have answered you are also admitting that, I think Mr Pretorius said, it’s strange or something like that.  So, I just want you to appreciate that you are also accepting that, what he said. So, if your intention is to admit that it doesn’t contain but you don’t think it’s strange or something like that, you need to make that clear.  I just thought that I must highlight that to you but if your intention was to say, I admit it’s not the same and I accept that it’s strange, I don’t think he used strange but he used some – he said something about the fact that, in the SLA applicable to Free State that this kind of provision wasn’t there.  So, I’m just mentioning, you canstay with your answer it’s fine, I just want to be sure that you appreciate what you are admitting.     Yes, okay, alright thank you.     3-7-8?     Mr Pretorius I’m sorry to interrupt you, don’t lose your point, I forgot this question earlier and Idon’t want to forget it again.     Do you know whether your late partner had any expertise or knowledge or experience or his company even in regard to the door – the audit and assessment part of the job?     He did not have, yes.  Do you know whether he knew that for purposes of the handling anddisposal of asbestos there needed to be accreditation, do you know whether he knew that or no?     Yes.     It’s not something that you shared with him?     Yes, but you don’t remember that you shared that with him, to say…[intervenes].     Yes.    Yes.     Yes, no I accept that.     Ja, no I understand.  Okay Mr Pretorius.     You mentioned it already.     Ja he did, he did Mr Pretorius.    Why does your file not have the…    No but we need to make sure we have the same thing otherwise there might be -  we might be – there might be confusion.  Is it a page missing or?    Hm.      Well …    Hang on Mr Pretorius.    379?  FS1.    Okay.  Yes okay.  You may proceed.   Hm.  Was not one of the differences between the project in the Free State and the project in Gauteng that in the Free State there was – you knew in advance how many houses needed to be audited and assessed namely 300 000.    I am not sure whether in Gauteng you had but I seem to think that if you had the same arrangement you would not get into this problem of doing 250 houses but or doing 300 or 400 or 500 houses but only being paid for 250.   So if you knew these are the houses it is 300 then you would say this is what we will charge you to do these and you would know where they are therefore even how much travelling would be involved you would be able to factor that in.    If you find more.    And you have no contractual obligation to do the new ones that you find you do not do them until there is an agreement that you may do them and you – there is an agreement on what you would charge.    Hm.    You must do it.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Okay.    Okay.  Mr Pretorius.  I see we are at to four?    I am – I am…    Yes.    Okay.  I am quite happy even if we are not going to finish for us to do as much as we can up to a certain point.  Maybe we can agree up to what point then we can take a break now.  I appreciate that Mr Pretorius you have been standing the whole day.    So maybe what we should do we should take a break now and then you and the legal or counsel for Mr Sodi can see me in my temporary chambers we talk about how much more time we can add today and then take it fromthere.    Quarter past?    Quarter past four.    Yes.    Okay right.  We will adjourn now Mr Sodi and then we will return soon after I finished with them.  They will see me at quarter past four.  We adjourn.    We have agreed that we will go on up untilsix o’clock this evening, and we know that we are not going to finish and another date will be determined.  That is the one point.The second is that it has been brought to my attention that the recording might not have captured the oath properly.  So for the record, I just want to say that the oath was administered for this witness.  Okay.  So we will not repeat it but the record will reflect ...[intervenes]     Yes.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you.    Okay.  Alright.  We proceed.      In other words, he would convince them of the need that you get appointed?   Ja.    Okay.     But he would unlock locked doors?    [laughs]   Well, just the one thing that is clear if you are right that that is the phrase he used “unlock theopportunity” or opportunities or whatever he said.  It was, at least, that is how he perceived it that there were opportunities that were difficult to access because they were locked.  He wanted to unlock those opportunities.  What do you say to that understanding?    If I say that is my understanding?    Ja.  Yes.    Ja.    What it would translate to at a practical level might be a different thing.   Ja.    H’m.    Yes.    To the real decision-makers.    Yes.    H’m.  Okay.    Ja, okay.    Yes, yes.    Okay Mr Pretorius.    Mr Pretorius ...[intervenes]     ...it depends on whether it relates to Mr Pretorius’ question.    Okay.  Alright.     Were you confronting Mr Mpambani about that?     Oh, about that.     Well, it refers to the letter that is on the page you were mentioning, Mr Sodi.      The letter from Mr Mokhesi.     Ja.     But Mr Pretorius wants you to say what you say in that paragraph, page 24.     But more or less the year before?     Yes, there was a letter from National from the National DG.     Yes, we – that is when we looked at this one as well Mr Pretorius because you compared both.     Ja, and you had quite some discussionwith Mr Zulu about and he was quite adamant that you know an appointment to a panel is not an appointment on the basis of which you can ...[intervenes]      The actual contract as opposed to the letter?     Because we were looking at the letter.     But was there a contract other than a letter?    There would have been an agreement.     But there was some agreement of sorts?     To a panel?     Okay, yes.   Do you think you might have it in the office or at home somewhere?     Alright.     So just to get some clarity on that kind of broad agreement, is my understanding correct that what you are saying is you when you have been appointed to a panel and there is in existence that kind of broad agreement you don’t perform any services and claim any payment on the basis of that broad agreement, there would need to be another instrument.     Yes, yes okay, ja.  That’s paragraph 3 of the letter ...[intervenes]      Would you like him to repeat the question?     Well I think he is still in the letter, on the page with the letter addressed to the CEO of Blackhead or the letter addressed to the DG of National?     The affidavit?    So that is page 384.     Your affidavit again.     Ja.     Mr Pretorius I know that we said six o’clock, but you do look tired.    And Mr Sodi on the other side seems to have more energy.   So no I just wanted to say we can go to six o’clock but if you feel too tired     Okay, alright, no I think it is fine.    Okay let us stop here, we will arrange another date Mr Sodi your counsel and Mr Pretorius have discussed with me you will be notified of another date, we are going to try and make sure that it does not take too long before you come back, but early next week we should be able to fix another date for you to come back..     [laughing]     So I suspect that you are challenging Mr Pretorius to continuing tomorrow and Saturday.   Okay.     Thank you very much to everybody thatwe – everybody cooperated for us to go beyond normal time to try and make use of the time.  We are going to adjourn for the day and another date will be determined early next week.We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair.    Yes we are.  Chair the first witness today is Mr Abel Manyike may he be sworn in?    Thank you.  Mr Manyike you have before you a bundle; it is Bundle FS and can I ask you to look at FS1 page 122. The numbers that we will refer to are the black numbers in the top left-hand corner of each page.  So if you look at FS1; 122, do you have that?    That appears to be an affidavit attested to by yourself.    If you would go please to page 140.  Whose signature is that?    Your signature?    And it appears to have been commissioned on the 18 October 2019.    Is that your affidavit?    And are the contents of that affidavit as far as you are aware true and correct?    Chair may we admit as Exhibit TT4 the affidavit at page 122 and following of FS1?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Manyike you are according to your affidavit a director of the ORI Group Pty Limited as well as a company called ORI Services Pty Limited?    Would you speak up please because the stenographer is – has difficulty.   Thank you very much.    You attended an interview with the commission investigators on the 27 August 2019.  That interview was recorded and transcribed?    And after the interview it was you perhaps with legal representation who prepared this affidavit?   According to your statements we could go to page 124 paragraph 11.  During 2013/2014 the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements and Gauteng Province conducted an asbestos audit and at that time a number of professional resource teams were appointed for that purpose.  Do you know of that?    Did you have anything to do with that audit just very briefly?    Right.  During that time did you come to know a Mr Radebe and the entity MasterTrade 232Pty Limited?    If we could go then to paragraph 23 of your affidavit at page 126.  Radebe communicated something to you in relation to a potential project in the Free State.  What did he tell you?    23.    Right so do I understand you correctly Radebe said to you that there was something cooking in the Free State and that – did he say anything about your potential participation in that groove?    Right.      And this project I understand it is now known to the commission was the Asbestos Project.    Right.  Now we know from previous evidence that the Joint Venture that obtained the contract from the Free State Department of Human Settlements comprised on an entity called Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited and Diamond Hill.  But for the purposes of our evidence it is easier if we refer to the directors andshareholders of those entities namely Mr Sodi of Blackhead and Mr Mpambani of Diamond Hill.  Correct?    Before this project was launched – in other words before any contract was awarded to the Joint Venture did you meet Mr Mpambani?    Right.  Did you in accordance with paragraph 24 have a discussion with Mr Mpambani?    Right and did he make any enquiries in relation to your relationship with MasterTrade?  Now we know from certainly your evidence that we will give in due course that the Joint Venture that was appointed by the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements sub-contracted the work to MasterTrade and MasterTrade according to your evidence sub-contracted the work to you.    The contract in relation to the Asbestos Project.    Was awarded by the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements – sorry not the Gauteng Department the Free State Department of Human Settlements to the Joint Venture.    That is Mpambani and Sodi.    Right.  That work – part of that work the detail will become apparent in due course wasthen sub-contracted to MasterTrade, correct?    And then MasterTrade’s contract was sub-contracted to you as ORI?    Mr Radebe of MasterTrade has a different version but we can deal with that in due course.  What he says is you were appointed in your personal capacity as a consultant for R5 million.    Yes I understand that.  According to your version that is not correct and that issue is the subject of litigation at the moment.    Yes I know that is not correct but that is his version.    It is correct that that is his version.    Is that correct?    Yes.  For a R255 million contract.    Alright but let us go on.  You say you had a discussion with Mpambani who was it appears sounding you out in relation to your potential involvement in this project. Is that correct?  Is that a summary of your evidence so far?    Right.  And did he come to any conclusion?  Did he advise you as to what he Mpambaniwould like in relation to the use of your services?    Yes alright.    And then – and that Soshanguve work was done in Gauteng?    As part of arrangements in Gauteng between contractors and the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements. MR    Right.    And you say that that was the National Department?  Are you saying…    Yes but that is what I am saying. I am putting to you that the work in Soshanguve that you did that Mpambani came to know about was done pursuant tocontracts in Gauteng between the Gauteng Department of Human Settlements and certain contractors.    And you were a sub-contractor in that arrangement?    Yes but you worked for Gibbs.    Who did – well then who did you work for?    Alright.  I do not want to get too involved in the details.    But you worked for a sub-contractor in Gauteng?    Did Mpambani and I am referring to paragraph 25 of your statement revert to you with a decision about whether he would like to make use of your services?   What did he tell you?  Well firstly did he say he would like to make use of your services?    To do what?    Yes.  Would you look at paragraph 25 of your statement.    You say here in your affidavit. “Mpambani advised me that they would like to make use of my services because I come highly recommended.”Is that correct?    He continues or you continue. “The idea was that I would be responsible or the whole asbestos audit on behalf of MasterTrade.” Is that also correct?    So did Mpambani tell you that they would like to make use of your services?That MasterTrade would be a sub-contractor to the Joint Ventureand that you in turn would be a sub-contractor to MasterTrade and you would do all the work?    Yes, no.    Yes.  No we know your version through other evidence and the court papers that the JV sub-contracted work and it will appear later – the whole ofthe work to MasterTrade.    MasterTrade then sub-contracted to you.    In your capacity as Director of ORI?    Right.  What I am interested in is    You say then in paragraph 26 that   Right.  And was it during these meetings that Mr Mpambani said that Mr Sodi’s right hand man Mr Zwane would be also working on the project?    Look at paragraph 27 please.    Was it during the course of these meetings with Mr Mpambani to which you have just referredthat you were informed that a Mr Martin Zwane would be working on the project as well?    Under the direction of Mr Sodi?    As Mr Sodi’s right hand man as you put it?    Yes now we will come in a moment to what Mr Zwane did and what he was apparently paid but for the moment let us move on.  As a result of your potential contractual involvement and as a result of the approaches made to you by Mr Mpambani to become involved as a sub-contractor to a sub-contractor did youfirstly agree in principle to become involved?    Did you become involved?    Did you agree to become involved?    Yes.  And you became involved and according to you a contract was signed between yourself and MasterTrade.    And we will come to that in a moment.  Did you make a presentation in relation to – well what were you asked to do in relation to the nature and organisation of the work to be conducted?    What is that?  I am sorry I cannot hear you Chair.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes well all this is introductory.  We are coming to the…    Matters on which he will tell his story in due course.    But I am grateful that I retain the ability to self-correct.   Right.    To whom did – did you make a presentation?    Right.  And what was the outcomeof that presentation?    Yes.  Right.  And you say Mr Sodi was present at that presentation.    Who else was present?    Right so the main contractor, the sub-contractor and the sub-contractor to the sub-contractor were all there at that presentation?    And what was the arrangement then made in relation to your status or ORI status in relation to the contracting and sub-contracting arrangements?    What was the arrangement?    What was the agreement?  What role would ORI or you play?    Right.    Yes.  Yes.    Alright but what was the agreement or arrangement between the Joint Venture representatives, the representatives of MasterTrade whom we learnt is the first sub-contractor and yourself as the second contractor.  What – what was the arrangement agreed to between these parties?    Okay.  Again, if I can ask you tolook at another document.  There is a bundle FS8 which will be given to you at page 200.      FS8 yes Chair.    At page 200.      The document at page 200 is a document…   We could provide you with a copy in the meanwhile.    You have that document in front of you Mr Manyike?    The document is a six page document or a five page document.What is that document?   It is a contract you say between     Yes ORI Group is your company.    And MasterTrade is the first sub-contractor which has been represented by Mr Radebe?    Right.  The heading is ‘Appoint’ – itis dated 31 October 2014.    And its heading is ‘Appointment for Professional Services’ self you say relating to what we now know as the Asbestos Project?    Well what were you appointed if you could just place on record paragraph 1? MR    The whole audit or just part of it?    Under paragraph 2, we see the scope of work.  It reads... if I may read it?  Free state ...[intervenes]    Alright.  And the proposed fee structure... well, before we get there.  Under the heading “Existing Consulting Team, there of Blackhead Consulting and Diamond Hill known as the Blackhead Consulting JV”.    Perhaps we should put it on record.  You...  “Due to the nature, for the benefit of the project, we would therefore like to bring it to your attention thatDiamond Hill and Blackhead Consulting, known as Blackhead Consulting JV, has been appointed by the Free State Department of Human Settlements and in turn has appointed...”Was understood by you to mean the whole project?    Then we see... right.  Blackhead as the first sub-contractor, the charges, we know and there will be direct evidence to this effect, R 44 million.  Correct?    R 44 million and some further rands and cents.  You, to do the whole work, contract with MasterTrade for a fee of R 21 391 489,00.  Am I correct?    Let us go on to the next page at page2.  R 8 509,30.  Am I correct?    Yes, I apologise.  A project management fee.    Alright.  So, and you are quite correct to point that out.  The project management fee which the contract between yourself and MasterTrade 232 Holdings provided for was eleven and a half million.   Alright.  And your expense budget, in other words, the actual disbursement costs, as I understand it, is stated in the agreement to be an expense budget in the region of R 9 982 000,00.    Alright.  And what is listed below in that schedule under the head of paragraph 4.1.2, appears to be the expense budget in some detail.  Perhaps you could tell us what this schedule represents.    Zero two.    It is a schedule of a table...[intervenes]     ...of what appears to be the makeup of the expense budget.    I would just like the witness to explain that in a little bit more detail, please.    Alright.    There will be some discussion later about the involvement of Mr Zwane and what he was paid but let us leave that aside for the moment.  These expenses here, were they the expenses for part of the project, the whole project for all the work you would do?  What was the case?    Yes, for the project?    And the whole scope of work, which you have already told the Chair was the whole of the Asbestos Project.    So if I understand it correctly that your practice in relation to the Asbestos Project was to charge ten percent of the overall contract fee charged to the department, the relevant department?    The charge of ten percent of the overall charge to the department, I understand your evidence is for that to conduct the whole project on the ground?    Alright.  So you say that in this case, you were informed by a benchmark percentage of the overall project to do all the work for approximately ten percent of the overall fee charged by the main contractor to the department?    Alright.  Is this a common practice in Gauteng?    Is this a common practice in Gauteng?    But this idea of charging a sub-contractor doing the work and charging ten percent of the overall fee, did this happen only in this case or did it happen in other Asbestos Projects in Gauteng?    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Manyike, if you go back to the schedule of expenses at paragraph 4.1.2 on page 202 of FS8, you will see there what appears to be, and you can help us, a comprehensive list of expenses ...[intervenes]     ...that were involved in the executed ...[intervenes]    [No audible reply]     Yes, I am aware of the difficulties you face or may face in litigation but I am only going to ask you what is your version.    I may put others to you for your comment but those... that comment would be based on your expert knowledge as a contractor.     But let us go back to 4.1.2.  Who paid these expenses?    Alright.  So you had the financial muscle to pay the working expenses or the operating expenses of the project.  Do I understand you correctly?    How did you know?    Yes.    Of course, the questions that have just been put to you by the Chair about the financial muscle, talk about the characteristics of entities seeking contracts.  The questions still remains.  What is a cost-effective charge for the work done?  As I understand this contract and your evidence, for the whole of the contract, borrowing one or two items like Mr Zwane’s involvement and the software that needed to be purchased, you could do the work for expenses of approximately R 10 million which would give you a management fee of approximately R 11 500,00.  Correct?   The Chair will decide in those circumstances of all the charges we have heard what is the cost effect of that one.  We do not need to go there.    If we can go over the page, please, to page 203?      Paragraph 5, staff component.  You are expected to provide the dedicated staff component. What is meant by that?  Is that the whole staff component for the field work?    And then under project programme   Alright.  So was your involvement required right until the final report?    If we could go back to ...[intervenes]     If we could go back, please, to 4.1.2.  I do not want to read through this whole schedule.    Point 2.    On page 202.    But on the face of it, and you can comment if you need to, this schedule involved preparatory work, the purchase of gadgets, the provision of transport and other items such as airtime required for the operation of the electronic gadgets.  Is that correct?  What does this comprise?    And I see ...[intervenes]     Yes.  What is Item 13?    For all the field workers or for some of them?    For all of them?    Yes.  What is Item 14?    No, 14.  One four.    Right.  And is there any provision here for payment to project managers?    Where is that?   Alright.    Yes.    On page 204, we see the signature of Mr Radebe, Director of MasterTrade 232 (Pty) Ltd?    And on page 205, what is that document?    Alright.    Thanking him for what opportunity?  The... was this... did it have any relationship to the contract?    Alright and is that the acceptance?     Would you go to paragraph 32 please?  You have told us that currently the ORI Group is in …[intervenes]     I am sorry, yes, please.     FS1, page 128, paragraph 32.    Bundle 1, page 128, bundle FS1, 128, paragraph 32.  You informed the Commission that theORI Group and MasterTrade are currently involved in litigation for monies that you say MasterTrade owes you, the ORI Group.     I would presume that you would have documentation in relation to the case?     And you would be willing to share that with the investigators.     And point out what you think theinvestigators might be interested in.     Thank you.  Thank you for that, we will take it up.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Manyike, we were still dealing with your affidavit in bundle FS1 and we are at page 129, if you would go to paragraph 35 please?     I am sorry, Chair?     From paragraph 35 onwards you described the work that you began to do as the subcontractor to the subcontractor.  What work was that?    What was the purpose of viewing the aerial photographs of the areas in the Free State?     Sorry, there is some interference coming from one of the computers, Chair, I just wanted to alert a certain person to that.     Do I understand you correctly then that the initial exercise involved looking at aerial photographs in order to identify houses which might have asbestos roofs?     If you could assist us on this side of the room just by way of summary.  You mentioned in you answer to the Chair that sometimes you encourage them to go into the yard.  Do I understand that correctly, not into the house, is that correct?     The audit that you were required to do, I understand it, was to identify houses with asbestos roofs, correct?     Not to identify houses that inside might contain asbestos in the ceiling in the water pipes orin fascia boards and the like.     The visual – sorry, you wanted to add something?     Right, so you were not looking at the internal part of that house which might contain asbestos in a window sill, for example, or in a pipe or in a ceiling, you were looking at the roof of the house because, as I understand what you say, government works this way, there can be asbestos in the house, that is for one sphere of government but if there is asbestos on the roof that is a provincial responsibility?     We understand that a house inside may contain asbestos products, inside the house.     What I understand your evidence to be is that your job was to identify houses with asbestos roofs.     Not to go inside the house and to inspect whether there was asbestos damaged or otherwise inside the house.     And you did the assessment or the audit, rather, let us stick with the audit for the moment, firstly by looking at aerial photographs and then where you identify it from the aerial photographs areas which contained or might contain asbestos roof, you sent fieldworkers to look at the house.     Those fieldworkers were armed with tablets, similar to an iPad, and they were then asked to go to the house, look at it and take photographs.     And assess.  Now the assessment, as I understand it from your evidence, certainly now, was in order to look and understand the structural integrity of the house.     And this work was done by peoplewho had had days training from the community.     Well, one would have thought that an accurate report on structural integrity could only be done by an expert.     So – but what the expert would do, perhaps in compiling the report, would look at the photograph presented by the fieldworker.     Did your experts go on site?    Well let us go then to page 131 of your affidavit, if we may.      131 of FS1.     You say the desktop analysis, which was the first step, took about two weeks to complete, with about six or seven people and that happened before 30 October 2014?     Then in paragraph 42 you described how MasterTrade arranged its quote.  Please tell the Chair about that please?     What did that quote amount to?     What would MasterTrade’s profit be in all this?     We know from your evidence and your contract that your fee in MasterTrade amounted to R21million approximately.R11million would be your professional fee and the remainder 9 to R10million would be for expenses.  Am I correct?     And that was to do barring one or two exceptions which we can mention in due course for the whole of the work including writing of the reports.    The expenses of 9 to R10million that we referred to in the contract which we showed to the Chair was for the whole of the work barring one or two items.  Mr Zwane’s fees for example software.      Yes.     Do you remember t the expenses and the contract between you and MasterTrade.    That was for the whole of the work.     Barring one or two items that we can talk about later.     And you mentioned one being the cost of the software for R600,000.      MasterTrade was going to charge the joint venture R44million in terms of the quote that you prepared.      What expenses for its share of the R44million would MasterTrade bare?    So its fee for being a middle man was half of R44million.     But what is instructive is that for and not unreasonable profit margin or professional fee you could do this work for R21million.  The social facilitator facilitates for a 100% of it to take it up to R44million, so itis now double the cost for social facilitation.           Something which the Chair quite rightly points out would be done by the ward councillors and provincial representatives.  But then we have a situation where this project quite apart from social facilitation and the work cost R225million.  What role did Mr Mpambani and Mr Sodi play? High level social facilitator.     Yes, okay.     Let us move on then to you just mentioned so that your evidence is complete.     We will get to them     Unless you want to say something briefly about them.     Steve Matao?     Yes, we will get to him.  But we know from evidence that perhaps you do not have that Martin Zwane of Zenawe was apparently a third sub-contractor to the joint venture and we know that he was paid R10million.      Yes, but that is apparent from thepapers but we will ask Mr Sodi about it.  But was there anyone else working for the joint venture that you know of besides Mr Matao and Mr Zwane that was involved in the production of the reports?     If one looks at paragraph 48 on page 132 of FS1 one will see their how the R44million quotation was made up by yourself and that was at the rate of a R147,36 to inspect the house.      R147,36.     So that is a substantial discount from R850,00 which is the fee that the joint venture charged.      But it is substantially less.     In the event the ORI Group put into the paragraph 55 of your statement on page 133 was only paid R6 133 716,00.     In paragraph 56 could you give theCommission an idea of what you actually did.  In paragraph 58.1 the numbering is incorrect Chair but…[intervenes]        Paragraph 56.     The sub-paragraphs are numbered 58.     But if you could - and perhaps I should leave you just so that we can get through this quickly.  How many fieldworkers or foot soldiers as you describe them did you hire to do the field work, the physical inspections of the houses?      And did you train them?    How long did that training take?     So the initial training in order toidentify the roof material and in order to do the structural assessment was four hours.     Then you say it was ongoing through monitoring?     But in paragraph 58.2 you say you hired a number of other people.  Who were they?     Now apart from those persons mentioned in paragraph 58.1 and 58.2 and apart from Matao and Zwane was anyone else necessary to do the work?     Do the work.     Yes.      Then you mentioned that the field workers received four hours of training and ongoing monitoring to improve their skills.  You deal with their work in paragraph 58.3.  How much were they paid per house?     And your second sentence in paragraph 58.3 is also interesting.  How long would it take as you put it the most inefficient field worker who ordered one house?     58.3 on page 134 of FS1.      And the most effective?    Then if we go onto – and by the way this is to identify the asbestos roof and to do a structural assessment sufficient enough to allow the compilation of a report later.  Correct?     Sorry you must…     We go to paragraph 58.4 you say you supplied the field worker with all the necessaryequipment and you trained them you have dealt with all those things previously.  In paragraph 57 you talk about the technology used in the execution of the Free State Project that is the software that was required to capture and process all the information that you put in through that software.  Do I understand you correctly?     And that would facilitate the production of a report?     And in paragraph 68 page 140 you summarise in paragraph 68 you say as such the houses containing asbestos with clear reference in that GPS coordinates for houses containing or suspected to contain asbestos were logged.  Now when you say containingasbestos, I presume what you really mean – or let me ask you an open question.  Do you mean a house with an asbestos roof?     Paragraph 68 where you say in summary what was done.     And then paragraph 70 you say wetook photographs of the houses containing asbestos and looked at the structural nature of the houses and recorded any structural damage as a defect.  How was that done by photograph?     Paragraph 58 on page 137 youmentioned that the joint venture had other professionals and, in that context, you told the Chair of Mr Zwane and Mr Matao, Steve Matao.     Paragraph 58 on 137…[intervenes]        You mentioned that you are aware that the joint venture had other professionals that were working in tandem with you.     What did they actually do, did they work with you in preparing the report as I understand it?     There is a third paragraph 58 at the bottom of page 137.     But we would not hold Mr Manyike…[intervenes]        Yes the numbering unfortunately.     But let us clarify the paragraph that I am referring to is the paragraph on page 137 the first paragraph 58.       You say there that I am aware that the joint venture had other professionals you mentioned Mr Zwane and Matao.  And what contribution did they make to the compilation of the final product that is the reports that you prepared and authored?     We will learn what they were paid in due course.     I would like to show you a report that was addressed by Mr Roets who gave evidence this week.  A document which appears in bundle 8 at page 270.     FS8 page 270 the report dated 2 February 2015 is marked final audit report.    270.    Of FS8.  Now if I could ask you please I know it is difficult because your space is limited.  If you could just look at Free State 9 FS9 as well.  And open that at page 2 just to tell you what that document is.  Page 2 of FS9 and we will look at page 3 when we get there.    FS9 page 2 is the cover page.    And page 3 is the page that I would ask.    Mr Manyike to comment on.  Let us start with the document at page 270 of FS8.  This is – is it correct one of the report prepared by you and authored by you?    Right.  In relation to a particular house as opposed to general observations that you might make regarding the quantity of houses in a particular area what information did the report contain?    In relation to a particular house that was identified through the desktop exercise.  We know that36 000 houses approximately were identified as a result of the exercise.  What information was given in the report in relation to any single house?    Of FS9?    That – that document you looking at.    Is page number 3 you are correct.    But it is contained in – just for record purposes Bundle FS9.    So in relation to a particular house one would present to the provincial authorities information as to its location particularly by reference to GPS coordinates.    There would be beneficiary details. Would that be the owner of the house?    Which in this case is blank.  I presume that is because nobody went into the house.    Alright okay.    Right.  And the structural assessment report contains the following information.  The roof material, right?  The roof type.  I must say I do not know much about the terminology used in building but you describe this as a pitch roof.  Is that a pitch roof in the photograph or a flat roof?    Well it is not clear from the photograph you say.  To me it is just one – a one dimensional roof.  It looks flat to me but I am not the expert you are.    Yes so the picture that is here behind the bush is a bonus?    But you say it was not required.    Well if it was a control measure –sorry to interrupt you then it was necessary.    You say yes?    Alright let us leave the photograph and let us look at the report.    It says   It then says Roof Type   If I may just ask?  You cannot see any cracks in the photograph but you say that was not something that was required.  Simply this – the broad statement visible wall cracks yes or no how does that help any assessment in regard to what needs to be done?  Whether the roof can be replaced or whether anybody could quote on any remedial action.    You see the report that you give to the province just says visible wall cracks yes or no.  It does not say well 3 millimetres – lots of cracks – 10 millimetres – one crack.    Alright.  Do I understand you correctly I am not sure I do understand you but do I understand you correctly if I say to you what you said to the province is you are going to have to do more work to establish the detail in relation to the structural condition ofthe house.    You are going to have to go and inspect and…    Yes.  Mr Manyike for the moment there is – let me put it this way.  For the moment the questions that you are being asked to answer do not go to whether you did what you were required to do or whether you did not do what you were required to do that the provincial department can answer to what they instructed you to do.  Let us assume for the moment you did what you were instructed to do I would like to know for the benefit of thecommission and the Chair in order to assess what the province mandated and paid R230 million for what the outcome of that was?  Now in respect of a particular house you have seen the document at Free State 9 page 3 and you have told the commission, you have told the Chair that this was the outcome of the report in relation to any particular house. Do I have that correct?    One last question and then we do want to give you an opportunity and I will address the Chair in a moment to make any final comment you want to do.  The inspection of the house to ascertain whether it had an asbestos roof or not was a visual inspection as I understand it.    Chair in fairness to Mr Manyike he should have an opportunity to make any further comments he wishes to and to consider whether he wants to do so.  We will make available the documents we have so that he can go through them.  So would this be a convenient time if Mr Manyike does not wish to make further comment we willbegin with the next witness.    Yes Chair and perhaps then rather than do it piecemeal.    We can…   Consult with Mr Manyike over the long adjournment.  It may be preferable and he may consider collating all the information, getting a transcript.    Of Mr Roets’ evidence and then coming back.    So that he can give a considered and complete answer rather than rushing the matter over oneadjournment with perhaps incomplete documentation.    Chair I was going to ask Mr Manyikeover the long adjournment whilst he was doing the other exercise to just look at a list of expenses that those contained in the affidavit of Mr Radebe of MasterTrade if.    May I do that now?    It will not take long.  Let me just take you there please to …    FS1.    Page 349 is the affidavit of Mr Radebe and the list of expenses appears at paragraph 16 on page 359.  So for example, you record airtime on yourexpense list which you said was the total cost for airtime when you did that work.  On your expenses was R600 000.00 here we see it is R3 million.  Would you comment please just briefly on the expenses in paragraph 16 of Mr Radebe’s affidavit please?  Page 359 you got it?    359 paragraph 16.  Mr Radebe says   But let me not put words in your mouth just would you comment on the contents of paragraph 16?    Yes Chair thank you.   Yes thank you Chair.    We will be in contact with Mr Manyike.    To give him all the information he requires to enable him to make full comment.    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi is the next witness.    His counsel wishes to address you.   Yes, thank you Chair.    So that the stenographers can pick up what you say.  Mr Sodi, you have made two affidavits for the purposes of the Commission’s work.  The first is in Bundle FS1 at page 375.    Would you go to page 475, please?    Whose signature is that?    The affidavit appears to be have been attested to on the 3 r d of April 2020.    As far as you are concerned, the contents of this affidavit, are they true and correct?    The second affidavit appears at page 152.    Sorry, I am incorrect.  It is the same bundle.    It is at page 502.    Yes, Chair.    Bundle FS1.    You would go through to page 520, please.    I have not yet.    Yes, you are looking at the numbers at the top left-hand corner.    Ignore the red numbers in the top right-hand corner if you will.    Sorry.  Are you at page 520?    Yes, five zero two.  It is the beginning of the affidavit.    Five two zero is the page to which I am referring Mr Sodi.    Is that your signature?    That affidavit appears to have been attested to on the 4t h of August 2020.    As far as you are concerned that the contents of that affidavit is true and correct?    Chair, that second affidavit should be marked Exhibit TT8.2.  We will fix that up.  But may I ask that the first affidavit at page...[intervenes]     Well, I have not asked for either to be admitted.    Yes.    TT2.    TT2?    No, TT2.    I am sorry.  No, I am incorrect.    It is 8.2.  You are correct.    And then the one at page 375 of FS1...    That should be admitted as Exhibit 8.1, TT8.1.    By now it is known to the Commission that you are a Director of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Limited.    On the following pages you list your qualifications and your various business interest but unless the Chair wants to know more about that for present purposes, they are matter of record.  If we could go to page377, please?    You say there in that paragraph that as far as you know there is no need to be registered to conduct asbestos audits.    You go on to say, however, there is however a need to be registered to handle and dispose of asbestos.    Then you say in the third sentence   That needs a qualification or acorrection as far as we are concerned, at least, because in terms of the SAL of the Joint Venture, the Joint Venture was appointed to remove asbestos.    Well, let us just clarify that.  If you go to page 458, please.  It is a letter addressed to the Joint Venture dated 28 May 2014.    In fact, it is not a letter addressed to the Joint Venture.  It is a letter addressed by the Joint Venture to the Department of Human Settlements dated 28 May 2014.    Where your request is to beappointed on a risk basis for assessment and audit, as well as, handling and disposal of asbestos sheets.    And is it correct that at some stage in the Service Level Agreement, you undertook that you had the skills and the capacity to do the work for which you were later contracted?    Well, the SLA ultimately entered into the... between the Department of Human Settlements, Free State and the Joint Venture.  It appears at page 92.  Sorry, page 466 of Bundle FS1.    Yes, if I may refer you to for the moment, at least, to page 468 of FS1 paragraph 4.2?    That reads and I will ask you to comment on it, please.“The service provider undertakes (that is 4.2.1) they have the capacity to and are able to enter into this agreement...”    4.2.2   Yes.  Paragraph 4.2 also refers to capacity and capability but let us leave the wording aside.    If necessary, the lawyers can argue that in due course.      Let us just look at the practical implications of Clause 4.2.    The department, the contracting department would surely want to know when it appoints a service provider that they are able to do all the word, not only form a skills and capacity and experience point of view, but they are permitted in terms of the law to do the work.  Surely that is the purpose of that clause.  Would you agree?    It is making it very cold Chair.    Ja.  But the other point that I think becomes relevant in another course in due course.  If the department knows that you have to sub-contract the word because you are not legally entitled to do the work then, surely, it would be better for it to go directly to that party rather than bear the cost of the sub-contractor arrangements?    Yes.  No, let us go back to page 458.  To your letter to the department.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi, of course certification in this case is particularly important because we are dealing with a life threatening substanceand therefore the particular skills required of someone who is handling that material and removing it and disposing of it of utmost importance.     Then, if we may go on, to page 466 of FS1, just to complete this topic.     466.     It is the service level agreement.     And I want to the draw the attention of Mr Sodi to page 467.     For a project for which you were    467, paragraph 1.1, definition of project.     The project includes in its     And in paragraph 2, under the head    Now you in fact quoted a figure and that figures appears somewhere in your proposal for the removal and disposal of asbestos and I think it was in the region of R36 000 per house.  So you in fact went so far as to quote yourself.     Right.  The point that we have beendiscussing, Mr Sodi, is relevant in another context.  If one goes back to paragraph 4.2 on page 468 of FS1.     The undertakings that we have placed on record.  At the time the contract was entered into and when the terms and conditions of the contract were being discussed particularly the price, did you disclose to the department that you were intending to employ subcontractors?     Do you concede then – well, this is not really a concession, would you agree, Mr Sodi, that had your partner disclosed the fact that you intended appointing subcontractors which was known quite early on and in fact before the project was entered into, project agreement was entered into.  That would have given the department an opportunity to interrogate what the project was costing them and what the project was costing in relation to theappointment of subcontractors and to make its own calculations and decisions in that regard.  Had Mr Mpambani made full disclosure to the department of the fact that you were appointing subcontractors and the cost of those subcontractors, had that been disclosed it would put the department in a position to assess whether this contract was a contract was cost-efficient or cost-effective.     Well perhaps as a partner one should have ensured that there was full disclosure to the department so that they could conduct that exercise.     Do you know whether the joint venture provided a full breakdown of its costs before the SLA was entered into?     For the record, because it may become relevant later, if you would go to bundle 8 please, it is behind you, marked on the side.     FS8 at page 163.     163.  this appears to be theproposal of the joint venture dated 28 May 2014 which later gave rise to the conclusion of the service level agreement, am I correct?     If you would go please to page 166, it is in that document that you say that your rates are as follows for the door to door assessment, R1 350 per house excluding VAT and then you say removal and disposal to an approved designated site and you actually quote not R35 000 but R32 760 excluding VAT.     To return to the point we were at a few minutes ago, Mr Sodi, the service level agreement undertaking in paragraph 4 regarding your skills, capacity and experience is important in another context too and that is insofar as subcontractors are concerned.  We agreed that the purpose of that clause, which we were discussing, is that the department can be assured that you can do the work and presumably that you will do the work.      I am back at the service level agreement.     Ja, we are back at bundle FS!, I apologise.     I am getting there, Chair.  Give me a moment Chair, I need to find that document.     I am looking for that clause that we were discussing earlier.     Paragraph 4, 4.1.2 that paragraph that contains the undertaking.     Yes, there is another SLA but letus just go with 468, paragraph 4.2.  That is the clause where you undertake that you have the capacity to and are able to enter into this agreement, and that you have all the necessary experience, skill and capability to render the service. I thought we were agreed, Mr Sodi, from your previous answer that the purpose of that clause, the intention behind that clause is to assure the Department that you, the joint venture can do the work.     And are prepared to do the work.    But what happened in this case is that all or certainly the material portion of the work was sub-contracted, not once but twice, we know that.     Now for the present, the question is, did you ensure or take any steps to ensure that full disclosure was made to the Department that you would sub-contract the work, not once but twice?     The related question is, did you ever give the Department a breakdown of the costs that you would incur as a joint venture in executing the project?     It would have been one of the duties of the Department in relation to this contract to ensure that it was cost effective. Now, I would understand that the appointment of sub-contractors, the breakdown ofcosts and expenses contemplated in the project would be the type of information that would be contained in a competitive bid process so that there can be a fair assessment of whether there’s value for money or cost effectiveness in the project.  Full disclosure of the costing would be required, wouldn’t it?     It would seem that in a competitive bidding process, there would certainly be substantialinformation that would have to be provided in regard to the costing of the project, you agree with me, and here there was no competitive bidding process.     Alright we needn’t take that any further unless you want to answer it.     Ja.     I may just, again for the record Chair, simply say that the project is defined as including both aspects of the project.     No.     Correct.    As was the proposal.     Well I understand your answer but it needs clarification. The Service Level Agreement is an actual contract, it’s a binding agreement between the parties and in its own terms is the whole agreementbetween the parties.     I don’t want to be technical with you, I’m sure you’re sick and tired of lawyers who argue legal or find legal points with you but I must put it to you, that the service legal agreement is a binding agreement, it must be read together with the instructions to perform workwhich gives more detail as to what you must do for what cost.     You agree with that?     Let’s go to what happened in Gauteng please.  You deal with that in your affidavit and the relevance of what happened in Gauteng has already become apparent but will become more apparent in due course.  At paragraph 9.1 on page 377…[intervenes].    Yes.     Ja we are back in Bundle 1, FS1 at page 377.     We’re going to paragraph 9.1, there you tell us…[intervenes].     3-7-7 yes.     There you tell us, Mr Sodi, what happened in 2009.  What happened in 2009?     That is Gauteng?     Then let’s look please at that particular Service Level Agreement which is at ES1, that’s red tab 1 page 406 of FS1.     Now, I don’t want to take the Commission through the whole of this document but this Service Level Agreement doesn’t contain any provision as to which particular work should be done and at what particular rates it should be done, correct, it’s a general Service Level Agreement which contemplates, as you said earlier, further agreements which would then incorporate terms and conditions of contract such as price and scope of work and the like?    And this Service Level Agreementwould have been entered into by all the members of the panel, the professional resource team panel.  Several would have been appointed and each one would have been issued with an SLA and signed the SLA and then later on, particular contracts would have been entered into for particular work, particular scopes of work and at particular rates, do I understand it correctly?     So just by way of example, if one looks at page 433, paragraph 18.1, “The consultant shall receive remuneration in terms of the various stages in which the consultant is engaged in by the Department through an authorised IPW”,That’s an instruction to perform work, that’s forlater.     You say that during the period 10, I understand now, onwards, you performed various services for the Department including, for example, construction supervision and monitoring services.  Do I understand it correctly that the 2009/2010 Service Level Agreement was for general construction work, not asbestos in particular?     Well again, your answer needs to be qualified to this extent, that the SLA about which we are talking now, the 2010 Gauteng SLA expressly incorporates the provisions for the services of others such as consultants and specialists and if I can refer you to page 415 of FS1 para 5.2.     You look at 5.2 it says, “The consultant, shall, at its cost engage and be responsible for such other consultants and specialists as may be necessary for the proper completion of the project. The Department shall cooperate with such consultants and specialists butshall not be responsible for them or for their performance”,There’s another clause, clause 5.5 which deals, in detail, with the right of the Department to appoint other additional consultants to perform the services through the project.  What is instructive, however, is that the SLA in the Free State contained no such provision.     Right then we go back, then to page 378 now of FS1…[intervenes].    Let’s then deal with the hailstorm that you spoke about, earlier in your evidence Mr Sodi.  You deal with that in your statement at page 378 of FS1.     Yes, before we get there, the panel that you refer to in paragraph 9.1, this panel of serviceproviders who were then employed to do particular work at particular rates in terms of other contractual arrangements, how many service providers constituted that panel?     Just a – you don’t have to be accurate.     Alright, fairly described as plenty.     Okay.     Thank you, let’s get back to thehailstorm Mr Sodi.  You say in December 2013 a hailstorm ravaged certain parts of Gauteng and this required certain work to be done for the Department of Human Settlements and then 9.8 you say what occurred from an appointment of service provider point of view, would you tell the Chair about that please?     Yes please just tell the Chair what that says and any comment you may wish to add.     Yes, well you say in the secondsentence, “The Department of Human Settlements then appointed a number of entities to conduct an assessment of the houses in Gauteng to determine whether they had asbestos in their roofs”,Correct, so the hailstorm gave rise to damage to certain houses, it was discovered they had asbestos roofs when the damage was inspected and then the Department of Human Settlements decided, well, we’re going to appoint entities to conduct an assessment of the houses inGauteng to determine whether they had asbestos in their roofs, how did that happen?    Do those events lead to the appointment of I think it was eight?    Service providers to do an audit and assessment of houses at the rate of R650.00 per house?    And did that appointment of the eight service providers take place during 2014 – the early months of 2014?   And what process was involved in the appointment?    That was the panel of between fifty and 100.    Certain service providers were summonsed and you were told you were going to be appointed and you are going to do the work at R650.00 per house and this is what you are going to do.    Alright just to confirm that would you go to Bundle 8 again please at page 88?  You might not have seen this document before but it does seem to reflect aprocess similar to that which you are describing and in fact by all accounts is the same process.    Yes I am sure.  But this is a memorandum which gave rise to the appointments which I will show you in a moment.  But if you go to page 90.    It says and this is to do with asbestos.  If you look at the third paragraph on that page. “The objective of the assessment phase is to undertake astructural assessment and quantify the entire stock of house accommodation roofed with asbestos in Gauteng.” That is the project we speaking about.    The second last paragraph on that    Yes and then over the page, page 92.    My apologies Mr Sodi.    You now have page 91.   There at the bottom of the page is the R650.00 per house.  This will be a fixed rate and the department will not accept any variations from this.    You say that is consistent with your view of that price being a take it or leave it price?   And if you go over the page to page 92 the recommendations were to approve attached terms of reference and approve the appointment of eight PRT’s for the assessment.  And as I understand your evidence you were one of the eight or Blackhead was one of the eight appointees.    And then if one goes over the page one looks at the Terms of Reference which are referred to inthe document we have just discussed.  That is at page 94 which motivates the establishment of the project.  And if you go to page 98 paragraph 5.1 do you have that?    5.1 says   Yes and the explanation is contained at least in part in sub-paragraph B because you are going to take off quite a light roof made of asbestos – it is not a heavy material and you are going to replace it with a new roof cover presumably heavier, am I correct?   And so you need to look very carefully at what the walls can bear.    Otherwise there is a risk of you doing quite a lot of damage when the house collapses.    And if one looks at 5.1.c. – 5.1 sub c.  The measurement of the size of the affected house in order for a roof to be designed for that house must also be done by a competent person.    The document goes on to describe in fact two more phases with what I wanted to ask you for the present purposes Mr Sodi you recall this as being the scope of work which applied in Gauteng when you did the work?    If you could go back to your statement please.  Paragraph 9.10 you confirm what youhave just told the Chair that when the asbestos audit came up in Gauteng at the beginning of 2014 Blackhead was one of the six entities, we now know it was eight entities appointed from the panel to conduct the asbestos audit in Gauteng.    Sorry 379 of Free State 1 – FS1.    379.    Thank you.  Paragraph 11 we have covered and unless there is anything you wish to add or comment on Mr Sodi we can move on?    Paragraph 11.4 you say you audited 0 000 more houses than the estimated 300 000 that you were contracted to audit.    And that you were paid for 300 000 not 500 000?  That is what you told the Chair earlier.    Yes I was going to say Chair there is simply no possibility of us finishing today at whatever hour we finish and so if we are going to go on for any time you could let us know.    But then we would like a break now.    We are not going to finish Chair.   The whole week Chair.    And we see you at what time Chair?    Quarter past four.    We will come to see you in chambers.    Thank you.    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi, we are at page 381 of FS1.  And we had completed matters related to Gauteng and the Asbestos Projects there, at least for the moment.  Do you have page 381 there?    At the bottom of the page, you described in your affidavit your first meeting with Mpambani.  For the record, we know that you and Mr Mpambani together through your respective entities formed a Joint Venture for the execution of the Free State Project.  Where did you meet Mr Mpambani?   And was that at a function in Welkom?    Yes.  Was he a well-connected person in the Free State?    What happened at the beginning of 14 between you and Mr Mpambani?    Sorry?    ...and in relation to the Asbestos Audit in the Free State, what happened between you and MrMpambani?    Alright.  I understand from your answer that the arrangement, at that stage, between yourself and Mr Mpambani was that he would speak to officials and that he would, together with those officials, make the necessary arrangements for the project to proceed in due course.    You use the word in your affidavit in paragraph 17 on page 382 of FS1 that he told you he may be in a position to... and I quote “unlock the opportunity”.  What does that mean?    So is it fair to say, in summary then, that not only would Mr Mpambani speak to people to persuade them to take on the project but also to remove any obstacles that may be in the way of the project going ahead?    I would understand that you being a businessperson and Mr Mpambani also being abusinessperson that the object of the exercise at that stage in unlocking the opportunity was not only to pursue the department in the Free State to take on the Asbestos Project but also to secure your appointment as the service provider.    And insofar as obstacles might exist which might have to be removed, you yourself mentioned that if there was no budget reallocation for that money that would have to dealt with.   Who represented who?  In other words, who were the parties to the agreement?    Alright.  There is a copy of the Joint Venture Agreement which appears as Annexure ES2.  It is atpage 453 of FS1.  And the terms and conditions applicable to the  Joint Venture Agreement appear at pages 455 and 456 of FS1.  That is the Joint Venture Agreement, is it?    I want to draw Chair’s attention to    What would Blackhead do for its 50% of the fruits of the contract and what would Diamond Hill Trading do for its 50%?    No, he must be able to answer completely.     Mr Sodi, I am going to for the sake of progress try and ask questions that are capable of amore brief answer.  I will do my best.     You say that the whole issue of subcontractors and particularly MasterTrade came much later.  You heard the evidence this morning of Mr Manyike who said that there were discussions between himself, Mr Mpambani and Mr Radebe long before the joint venture was …[intervenes]     And we are dealing here with apartnership and partners decisions and actions are attributable to the partnership but that is nothing that we need to deal with now.  I just seems that there was a situation between the partners where there was no full disclosure.     Well, you are in litigation with Mr Mpambani’s estate at the moment, I understand.     It seems though for his 50% share, however that was expressed ultimately in the joint venture agreement, that his job was to do two things.  Well, three things, in summary.  The first was to speak to the officials and persuade them or arrange that the outcome of those engagements at least was that the Free State Departmentof Human Settlements take on the asbestos project, firstly.  You have said it now.     The second one, obviously as a businessman representing in a partnership, interested in business and doing business with the Free State was to secure the – insofar as possible to secure the work for the joint venture.     And insofar as there were any obstacles in the way those would also have to be dealt with and it would be, amongst other things, his job to do so.     And as said in paragraph 19 on page 383 Mr Mpambani did not disclose to you the names of the particular officials with whom he met.     You must have come to know of those names in due course surely?     You were in correspondence with some of the officials.       Who was that?     Page 384 in paragraph 20.1 after your meeting with Mr Mpambani did, he come back to you with any report?  What did he say to you?     So he is tasked, according to the understanding between yourself and himself, Mr Mpambani is tasked with approaching the officials in order to in general terms unlock the opportunity in particular to persuade the officials to embark upon the Free State project and to secure your appointment and he comes back to you and he says in the words of – in your words at 20.1, he reports to you that he had engaged with the governmentofficials in the Department of Human Settlements in the Free State and that they had requested that the JV submit a proposal.  Success on two counts.     Was a proposal prepared?     And was that submitted to the Department of Human Settlements in the Free State?     Right is that the proposal at annexure ES3 of the attachments to your statement and it appears at page 457 of the first one.  You know this document.     Yes, you would have looked at it at the time, I presume.     And you know it now particularly because you are involved in litigation.     About these issues, I take it.     But if you look at page 457, this is the proposal submitted to the Department of HumanSettlements Free State Province and there it is dated the 28 May 2014 for attention of Mr Mokhesi, Mr Tim Mokhesi.     And it is submitted by the joint venture.     Is that correct?     So on the 28 May 2014 Mr Mokhesi knew that the joint venture was the instance which waspresenting the proposal.     And that is the proposal we referred to earlier in your evidence today dated the 28 May 14, it appears at page 458 and following.  That is the document in which you request to be appointed to do the assessment and audit and the handling and disposal of asbestos.  That is confirmed in several places including at page 461 under the heading Objective and under the rate per house consistently throughout.  The proposal at least is that you would be appointed for the assessment and audit as well as the handling and disposal and in fact you go so far as to say, in fairness to you, Mr Sodi, that the scope of work describes the asbestos removal and disposal as being undertaken in accordance with the OccupationalHealth and Safety Act and Regulations 85 of 1993.  That appears on page 462, correct?     It was some three weeks later that Mr Mokhesi then addressed a letter to you confirming the appointment or making the appointment.     I am on page 384 now and if you look at paragraph 20.4.  What happened on the 19 June 14?    464, we will get there.     Let us go back to page 384, paragraph 20.4.     What happened on the 19 June 14?     Alright, let us go the letter and see what it says.     Okay, let us go to the addressee, that is yourself, the CEO of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd, not the joint venture.     Okay.  And the subject matter of     Proposition I put to you and it was so worded as to be capable of a brief answer, Mr Sodi.     Do not worry, please do not take that personally.  No panel was appointed in the Free State, correct?    Alright.  You whether in the guise of Blackhead Consulting (Pty) Ltd or the joint venture, let us leave that confusion aside for the moment, but a single appointment was made in the Free State, correct?     Well, Mr Mpambani would have spoken to Mr Mokhesi to say listen, facilitate this and whattranspires, quite frankly, is a great deal of confusion and we will go each step of that confusing process in due course but paragraph 1 says – and I am not talking about numbered point one, I am talking about the first paragraph     Where you say we, as a joint venture seek appointment, correct?  And your appointment by the National Department of Human Settlements, that would appear to be some other appointment, correct?     But it there it says    To some are complex, that you are not an expert in this and I do not expect nor will the Chair expect any detailed legal analysis of the provisions of 16 A 6.6, that is for another time and maybe to be dealt with with the account officer in the Free State, but for the present what contract is being talked about here, in practical terms?     The National Department?     Oh, so that “contract” that is being talked about there is an appointment to a National Panel ofservice providers?     It is not a service level agreement or an instruction to perform work which comprises particular terms and conditions, prices, scope of work and the like?     When was that panel arrangement entered into with the National Department?     More or less.     Would you have that appointment letter?     And perhaps the investigators can obtain that for you so we can get some clarity in this matter.    Yes.     Perhaps I should follow my own advice in regard to clarity and brevity Chair.  What I was intending to secure amongst the documentation were – was the content of that appointment, what was that appointment.      Yes.     Yes.      Was the SLA similar to the Provincial one with general terms?       But what is clear that that would have been a service level agreement similar to the panel appointment in Gauteng where general provisions are made but the sale terms and conditions of work and payment and rates would be in a later document.     Paragraph reads     From 464, Free State 1464, the letter from Mr Mokhesi to the CEO Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited, Mr Sodi.  So that person is Mr Zulu we know.   His approval was required, at least in terms of what is going on here.     And then 4, that your appointment will be subject to your company securing funds to roll out the project in line with your proposal.  Now the meaning ofthat sentence you deal with later, correct?     You have to say yes because the stenographer needs it.     It is signed by Mr M Mokhesi but that is the person you have referred to as Tim Mokhesi is that right?     Then over the page, page 465, isthe accompanying letter that requires to be sent in terms of the Treasury Regulation 16(a) 6.1, it is addressed to Mr Zulu, also from Mr Mokhesi.     The Free State Department of Human Settlements in terms of paragraph 3 or 2 of that letter says hereby requests your department, the National Department, to extent – it should read extend – the services of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited in line with Treasury Regulation 16(a) 6 of March 2005.  Now what is instructed apart from anything else that we might or might not deal with, but what is being dealt with here is a contract with Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited, contemplated on the one hand, and a panel arrangement between Blackhead Consulting Pty Limitedand the National Department of Human Settlements, is that a fair assessment of what’s going on here?       And again I was trying to put it briefly.       The document at page 464 isaddressed to Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited.     That is the entity that was involved in the panel arrangement with the National Department of Human Settlements.     Not the joint venture?     Similarly, on page 465 mention is made of Blackhead Consulting Pty Limited and not any joint venture?     As you describe it in paragraph .4, and that is why we started with paragraph 20.4, what is being sought here it appears is the appointment ofBlackhead as a PRT, professional resource team, to the department.     Well I am really going back to the ...[intervenes]      ...the understanding in paragraph .4.     Correct Chair.     Yes.   20.4 the whole objective, this correspondence and what’s going on here is for Blackhead’s appointment as a PRT to the department, correct?   In other words as a member of some panel in the department.     But that’s not what happened?  The joint venture was appointed as the only contractor for asbestos removal and assessment in the province, correct?    Alright.  And we dealt with the statement in paragraph 20.5 so we can go to 20.6 because the next step that you refer to in your affidavit is the step that took place on 1 s t of October 2014.  What happened on that day?  Page 385 Mr Sodi.     As you say appointing it, that is theJV, as the service provider, there is  no question of any panel being appointed?     Let us move on then to 20.7, what happened as described in that paragraph?     Then it is the appointment of a JV, a single entity?     What the SLA provided for was the appointment of a single entity, the joint venture?    We have been through it earlier today but I would like to draw your attention and the Chair ’s attention for later, the paragraph 4.3.6 on page 469      In other words you weren’t to be paid, well you weren’t even to invoice, let alone be paid, but you weren’t to invoice and you weren’t to be paid unless you provided a detailed report, telling the Department what you had done in terms of the instruction to perform work, correct?      The payments as I understand it would allow a contractor without financial muscle to bid and receive work and do work to facilitate the engagement of a contractor without much capital.    We could go please to page 386, we have dealt with the preceding paragraphs already, paragraph 22.1.     Do you recall we spoke earlier of the budgetary issues?     And here you explain the provision in the joint venture proposal that you would be appointedon a risk basis and that you would be obliged in terms of the Service Level Agreement to sort out the finances.  If you – I am happy that, or I am sure the Chair would not mind, it being late in the day, you read the contents of this paragraph.     Please.     I am trying my best to look tired Chair.     Chair I would appreciate 20 minutes off.     Thank you Chair.     [laughing]     We get on well, but not that well.

MR MANYIKE:  My name is Abel Kgotso Manyike.    No objections.    Yes.    Yes.    So help me God.    Yes I have.    Yes.   The bottom it is my signature.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes it is.   Yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes it was me who prepared the affidavit that is correct.    Yes I know of that.    Yes I did.  I was part of the – the team that audited Soshanguve that is one area Pretoria.    Yes we met there but Mr Radebe we met before – before that audit.    Paragraph 26 Chair?    23. He mentioned there was something inthe pipeline but his exact words – he used the word ‘cooking’.  He told me there was something cooking.  By that I interpreted that as meaning there was a potential of something happening or there could have been submission.  So it – it gave one a feeling of expectation.    He in passing but he did not go into much details but it is someone from time to time we would engage and talk about projects you know to catch up.    But he was not specific but I knew in Free State there was a potential of business but from who and itwas going to be issued to who I did not know at that time.    Yes, yes that is the Asbestos Project.    Yes.  Correct.    I notice during the litigation process that the contract was awarded somewhere in I think December.  So to answer your question yes we did meet before that.  I did meet Mr Mpambani before the contract was signed with the department.    Yes we did have a discussion at that time but it was more like a – I would not want to call it aninterview somehow I sensed that he – Mr Mpambani in that meeting he was – he wanted to know about my capabilities and what I have been involved with previously.  So yes the meeting sat but it was more of an interview wanting to know my professional background and so forth.    Please rephrase that?    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Sodi yes that is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is not correct.   Yes that is true. ADV PRETORIUS    That is not correct.    Yes.    Okay.    That is his version.   Yes that is – that is his version.    Yes, yes it was more like an interview.    He did not go into much detail at that time but I – from the questions he asked I figured it could be something related to what I did in Soshanguve.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    It was the Gauteng – Gauteng – Gauteng province that …    Yes.    I was not a sub-contractor I was – I was one of the entities that was awarded such contracts was Gibb.    No I did not work for Gibb.    Okay I worked – at that time Gibb sub-contracted a portion of the work to other consultants of which one of them was a company called Imendo.   Okay.    Yes that is correct.    Yes, yes he did.      Yes he did highlight that.  That he would like to make use of my services.      I would not say it was in that meeting.  Maybe other meetings that followed that.  It was about the audit to do a similar work I did in Soshanguve.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    That is correct.    At that time, it was not put out like that.  All I knew was that I was going to be involved on the project on behalf of MasterTrade.  The – as in terms of how the agreement was going to be outlaid it was not clear that time.  But later when it – as things transpired, I became the sub-contractor to MasterTrade.    Whether I was going to be directly contracted to Blackhead, JV or to MasterTrade at that time it was not something that was discussed.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes, yes that is correct.  Yes that is correct.    Say again?    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.    Yes I was told that Mr Sodi’s right hand man is Mr Zwane.    Say again Sir.    Yes.    Yes I agreed to become involved.    Yes.   I was asked to prepare a presentation for Mr Sodi.    That – that presentation it was required from me to demonstrate more or less what technology was used on projects that I have worked before in particular the Soshanguve Project.  That is what I was asked.    Yes I did.  Presentation was very short.  It did not even last more than fifteen minutes.  I did the presentation to Mr Sodi, Mr Mpambani was there and Mr Radebe.    It was verbal.  It was something that could be used by them in – in this case in the Free State.    Yes Mr Sodi was present.    Mr Mpambani, Mr Radebe was there.  That they recalled.  Mr Sodi’s right hand man Martin Zwane I think he came late that day.  So those gentlemen they werethere.    Yes if you wish to put it like that ja they were.  They were all there.    What was the what?    The arrangement?    At that time to Mr Sodi we – thepresentation – we did not touch on issues of contracts as to who is going to be sub-contracted to who.    For him.    At that time, it was about the presentation if we will be able to do the work.  I – I only noticed later that he thought that I as working for MasterTrade.  At that – on that level it was inappropriate to discuss contracts.  So we were just there to demonstrate the software to him.   The – between the parties JV – the JV agreement understood that the work was going to be sub-contracted to MasterTrade and MasterTrade sub-contract to me.  From the JV I am referring to the two that I just now Mr Mpambani, Mr Sodi.  Mr Sodi him I never engaged that much but Mr Mpambani was above board.  He knew exactly what was happening that I had a contract with MasterTrade.    Yes I have.    It is my contract between ORI Group and MasterTrade.    ORI Group and MasterTrade.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    The whole audit.    The whole project.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is not correct.  I did not enjoy it.  I am still not paid.     That was the intention.  That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    This was a schedule of quantities.  What happened.  For us to get to that, to this, me and MasterTrade, we sat down.     Yes.    This... no, that was sufficient for the project,for the scope that was... for the... for this contract that was awarded to me.  So it was sufficient.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Sorry, Chair?    Yes, I had done it before.    Yes.    This type of work Chair is fairly new.    Ja.  A lot of people that started doing this work, would have been exposed from the year 2013/2014.    So this is fairly new... I do not know if I can call it industry, but line of work.    Yes.  So when it started, I was part of that.    Yes.    I would say it was the fourth if not third.    Yes.    It is ...[intervenes]     It is hard to say Chair because this... it depends on the outcome.    And the outcome is always different.    Like for the... the way I can compare apples with apples is the Shoshanguve Project.      But I know it was... they are charging moresingle rate.  I am aware of how much consultants charge to get this.    Those who are contracted to the department.    Yes.  So what I will do, I will always charge ten percent of their amount.    For me it is fair and then it is profitable.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, my charge to this was informed by a number of factors.  Number one, I am aware of the rate which was offered by Gauteng to those that did this project before.  So I was aware of that.  Number two is the number of times spent and the professionals.  So it was also... it was time-based versus value-base.  So one, when you pass for such jobs, you will look at such factors and you also consider the competition in that province to say, “How many of you are doing this?”  I will call it specialised work.  So that informs you will... how much you charge.    This project... what I am saying to you Chair.  The rates that were used in Gauteng and in Free State orwherever at a certain point of this nature has been used.  I can use... I can do that job at ten to twenty percent of what the municipality ...[intervenes]     Yes.  Simply because this is our bread and butter.      Yes.    Yes.   It is not a common practice.  Hence, I am saying to you this is a fairly new thing.  This really started in 13 late, around June/July somewhere there.  And people are no longer involved in type... in this type of work.  Are few, are limited.  So there is nothing cast in stone but one will try at least to be competitive, like in my case I will do that    Okay, in other Asbestos Projects in Gauteng, what I have seen, you will find the main PRT they would sub-contract some other companies.  It... well, where I was post... exposed in Pretoria.  That is what happened.  There were about four, five sub-contractors under the main contractor on the team, Zwane.  So it is not as if... I would say... I would not say it is an extraordinary thing what happened in the Free State because of the number of resources and expertise that is required to deal in such projects.  To answer your question.  That is what I also saw in Gauteng.    Chair, I would ...[intervenes]     Well, I would have done that Chair but Iwould have partnered with someone with financial muscle.  Let me put it that way.  Simple because government, before they award jobs of this nature, they look at your financial position.  So I would have been disadvantaged.  I know this type of projects.  They are going to millions of rands.  I would have partnered with someone like Gibob(?)    Gauteng did set a president for this type... for value of works for Gauteng or Free State or whereversuch projects would be done.  So we know that if a tender was to come, let us say in the Western Province, is regarding this particular work, it will run in those ranges.  The requirements for one to participate would be high.  So you will find medium-size companies like us, we somehow get squeezed out.  So, but I would have tendered for that but maybe went with someone with financial muscle for such a project.    Yes.    Yes, I would have ...[intervenes]     ...to pull up a team.  The manpower.  I would able to do that.    But the down payment... to start a project of this nature, we are looking at ten, eight million upfront.  Not mentioning the guarantees from government.  So it is veryexpensive.    Yes, the guarantees.  Yes.    It will come back.  The problem is giving it Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, I will... I will meet the requirements.    I will have two answers for you Chair on thatone.  I do not know which one will be...    As a businessman, I am informed by the market and see how the market is functioning.  I know that six hundred-and-fifty is a rate that has been reasonable to government elsewhere but I will maybe come slightly to go fifty percent lower.  I will still make a profit.  But in a case whereby the work is not under my name, I will be extremely competitive as I was.  I am saying to you, I can most... I can charge between ten to fifty percent of whatGauteng paid or Free State.  But that will be on the condition that I am a sub-contractor like I was.  But if I was the main contractor going for such jobs, the six-fifty in Gauteng will inform how much I price for that.      To make that decision, yes.    Yes, that is true Chair.   That is correct Chair.  If I may add on that?  The only difference is that you will never be given that chance to go down.    The only difference is that you will never be given a chance to say reduce your price.    By any department where you are tendering but ...[intervenes]     Yes.    So the price you put, that is your final price.    But I will go fifty percent or even sixty percent less ...[intervenes]     ...to get the job.    Yes?    I will reduce Chair.    Yes.  I will reduce.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Mr Pretorius?    If I can just come in a minute?    Just to remind you, this matter is still under litigation, né?  So I would just like to appeal to the Commission ...[intervenes]     ...that I am not being represented by any attorneys.    I am presenting myself.    So take it easy with the question.    Especially when it comes to my project.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    These expenses, they were paid by ORI Group of which we have the proof of payments.  The bank statements, that will reflect.  We have also attached them in our court papers.  They are there.  But should there be a need... should the Commission need this, we can submit.  We can issue it to the Commission.  But it is ORI Group that paid for all these expenses.  The only expense which we were supposed to pay for that we did not pay for of which it was not contractual is when it involved the purchasing of the programme.  That money we had allowed.  We had allowed on thecontract.  So that is the only money that we did not pay.  It was in the region of six hundred thousand, somewhere there.    No, I do not have that financial muscle.      The expected cost was R 9 million.    Ja.  So where payments were coming instages to me as the work progressed.  Ja.  Not... towards the end, payments stopped coming.  As I am talking to you know, I am indebted to those people that served ORI Group, other professionals because of this project.    Yes, that is correct.    Yes.    [No audible reply]     The entire workforce.    I did provide that.    Yes.    I did provide that.   Yes.    Four point one...?    Yes.    Yes.   This comprises goods and services that will be needed to execute a project.    ...and to give the desired outcome.    Field workers salary.    For all.   Two point... R 2 250 000,00.     Printing.    Office technicians.    Yes, there is.    We used different jargons internally.  But my project managers, they would fall under Item 18 team.    Ja.  So they will be... I will be the project manager under ORI Group.    And they will be assistant project managers.  Ja.    Yes.    This was an acknowledgement letter to him that we... we were thanking him.  That, thank you for theproject.  And this was sent to him via email.    Ja.    Yes, we are acknowledging... it was a letter, in fact, that said there was a condition in the contract that we must accept.    Ja, this was the acceptance letter.   Yes, and also to give our commitment.    Yes.     Can I have some water, Chair?     That is correct.  Chair, if I can say something in relation to that case?     Case number 69173/18.     Yes.  During the investigations, I came across the SI and something I observed there is like they went to the court to get the statements, the affidavits, and it appeared as if certain affidavits in that file grew feet.  So I do not know how to put – what needs to be done but I saw that being a limitation to them being able to executetheir investigation.  From the documents they were holding, I could see that there was alleged deliberate intent to withdraw certain statements from that file.     Ja, the SIU.     SIU, Special Investigative Unit, yes, when they came to interview.     Yes.    They were looking for affidavits and statements that were made.     But it was within that bundle.     But I could see that what they were looking for they did not find in that file so it is like somebody touched a file in the wrong way.     I just wanted to put that out there.     Yes, they were taken out.     I did not discuss with them, it just came across my mind now, as I am sitting.     Yes because the – I have seen bold statements of people saying they have paid so and so butthe proof of payments are there.  You know, a person would think twice before writing a statement like something that could be easily proven.  That is why I could see that there is a strong hand messing with things.  I do not know…     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.         I am on 35.     I am on 35.     It was the viewing of the paragraphs, the share files, the view of the houses, the areas where we worked.     The purpose, Chair, is – in the Free State you have over 600 000 stands so I, in my view, I will see the department to ask anyone to come and audit, they will not monies to do that, it will be – the scope will be too much, so what would be advisable and what would beproper and what I deem as the only way is to look at the aerial maps first of these areas where asbestos could be concentrated, then from thereon it is about training.  One can see if it is as asbestos from a shape file that is recent, you can see it more or less.  Then after we have done that then we are able to somehow get to a point to say this is how much work we are looking at.  So that was the whole purpose of that exercise, for us not to waste resources going to areas where we are not supposed to go because if you looked at the aerial photographs you will notice from the aerial view that the asbestos houses and those that are done with corrugated iron, over 50 years they look the same from the aerial view, so – but historically, we are aware of places where black people were allocated and people of colour, the coloureds and other smallholdings, sowe are able to see that on the aerial photographs so that it helps us not to waste resources going to areas that we should not be going to.  So it is cost-effective way of doing things other than what was done in other areas, that exercise was never done, people were just told to go and audit.  So we took the precautionary measures to make sure that we limit movement on the ground, seeing how big and vast the Free State is compared to other provinces.       Yes.     I saw that, I think it was televised this past Tuesday and me, just watching TV, there was a revelation as to say why we had a delay on Tuesday andthe Wednesday, is something I would leave to the Commission, also to the Free State as a given, to say – that is what I can see, if this can be fixed, will have attendance here.  But I will touch on that but I want to come to issue of the expert.   As I was preparing for this presentation at my house, I was with the kids, watching TV, I heard my – I am the author of the four files that were submitted to Free State and other …[intervenes]     I am the author of the four reports that were submitted to the Free State.     So I know how they look, so I – just to go the relevant attachments and packaged everything.  So my file at home was looking like this and as I watched TV, the expert, the file was looking like this.  So immediately I could see there was a problem and even the things that he touched on, he said – to the asbestos project, to remove the roof it is about 6’, 7 000, the house -  I said but that thing is there in the report I wrote, it is there.  He spoke about the bill of quantities but I think also us speakers that comes here, Chair, it is our responsibility also just to educate to say people will talk about phase 1, phase 2, phase 2, before you know it, people are confused and Iwas somehow concerned to say was the expert really relevant or not on two primary issues.The expert came clear to say he is accredited by SANAS.SANAS reports to DTI together with the companies – the companies and the soft engineering part of things but though you find the panel of Public Works whereby the built environment reports to that.   So when I talk about the build department I am talking about the architect, the engineer, the structural engineer, the electrical, the mechanical.  I would have expected -the environmental specialist, I would have expected that person to come and say they are specialists because of two fundamental issues.  What the expert was talking about, he was narrating what happens in phase two of the project.  What is phase two?  Phase two is the implementation.  Phase one is the inception, conceptualisation, detailed preliminary.  That is phase one and the Department of Labour is silent, what happens before phase two.  There is no legislature that talks to that.  So you find someone who is specialising on a small thing within the bigger scheme of things coming here to say they were expert and I am saying that with all due respect.  You are wasting the Commission’s time.  He wastalking to his experiences under implementation.  We know this project not a single asbestos roof has been removed.  So what was he doing here?  I wanted to give that out. But on the issue of the reports, I would see there was something wrong with the report because what he making reference …[intervenes]     Yes.     It is different, Chair.     There is auditing during the construction phase.     Yes.  This type of work, the environmental part will be handled by an environmental specialist during planning stage when you are doing the project conceptualisation, inception and so forth.  This is way before the expert comes.The expert comes, for him to be absorbed into thebuilding environment is when he comes in as a contractor.  That is phase two.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.     Yes, I agree.     Yes, that is correct, Chair.     It was part of it but the extent of the scope, how the expert put it, he – I think he went too much into details.     That is – there is two assessments that you do, Chair.     There is one before construction, there is one given at planning stage, that is the one we did.     But now when the department says we are ready to now – let say remove the roof of this building, that is where such specialists they come because now sometimes you can maintain the asbestos or you remove aportion, you can do this – but in Free State, the intention was not to – whether to maintain rooms or do this, it was to completely remove the roof and replace it.  So, by me saying that, there was no need for anyone to go underneath, inside the houses and check this, the roofs had to be removed.     When you assess in the context of a new contract …[intervenes]     Yes, when you assess it is referring too much to the structure integrity of the loading bearing walls.  The roof, it is a given, it has to go.  So when you say assess, the expert in this context, it could be maybe maintain this or paint it there or do this, so it would be more detailed to that extent.  So but our assessment, as I understand it, is about the – looking at the house to say was there a crack on the house, can this house still stand with the – if they lift the roof?  If the answer is no, then the whole house must beremoved.  If the answer is yes …[intervenes]     The assessment was heavily on the entire structure of the house which is something that falls outside the expertise of the expert, Chair.     That is number one.  So the decision that asbestos must be taken away, it is a given.  It was – we are not assessing the asbestos, we are purely identify the asbestos and you reference it as to where it is, how many are there, asbestos, where are they, what size and so forth and how far are they from the landfill sites where they must be disposed of.  That was the importance of the assessment.    No, it does not.     No, it is …[intervenes]     No, you do not have to – yes, that is correct, Chair.     Yes, you do not test the asbestos, you identify it.     We train people on how to identify asbestos.  From outside, first of all you look at the shape and the colour.     Ja, the roof outside.     Ja, if you cannot see the colour, if it ispainted, you look at the shape.  So we train our people what to look at and mostly on houses with asbestos you will find they will not put in gutters and so forth.  So these are things that people look at and we even encourage them to say if you can, go inside the yard, look underneath and then …[intervenes]     Yes, yes, Chair, and …[intervenes]     Yes.     And to my amazement, I will say 95% of people that were trained, they knew what was asbestos.     Ja, the audit part is the asbestos.     The assessment part is the structure, the integrity of the house.  We put other questionnaires therefor us to have an indication as to what exactly.  But the bulk of the works was done by the programme, things like your geophysical and so forth.     So I will say maybe on the assessment, 40 percent was done by the fieldworker to say when you get to a house, we look for these things when you assess this, the structure integrity of the house.     You look at the cracks, you must becertain and then you record it like this, is the house plastered which is very, very – an issue if the house is plastered a lot.     The house …[intervenes]     No, it is going to inform the bill of quantities.     The bill of quantities will inform the budget.      Alright.  What is happening now inMamelodi, I think the past two years, when they were doing these houses, also I so somewhere being removed in Soshanguve. If the house is not – is plastered and it had asbestos, when you remove the asbestos, the wooden posts must also go away, you find some of them – they are no longer in good condition, so you put this steam and then on top you will have to plaster, you will have to fix, so it is important that you match these things.  Where there is a geyser on the roof it adds to the cost, someone mustremove that geyser and put it there.  So these are some of the things …[intervenes]     No, the person who is making the assessment, you make that allowance, that record if there is a geyser.     Because we know and later on when should the department appoint whoever to come and do …[intervenes]     …these houses, that thing will be an issue.    To say that there was a geyser here.     Yes, it adds to the cost.     Yes.     Yes.     We – there are number of things which can cause structural problems.  One of them could be the foundation also but on this project, it was agreed that we will not be doing geotechnical studies, visual inspection would be sufficient.   I want to come there, Chair, just to show you that asbestos here is not the thing, it was about the structural integrity and they are even comments about more people could have been appointed, the councillors could have chosen so and so and said then count these houses and…[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.  No, it is not ignorance.     Yes, it is not ignorance, Chair.     That is what I am saying, some of us will come on these platforms, we fail from our respective fields,we somehow, we need to inform.  To count and to audit are two different things.  We know of projects in Gauteng whereby they were committing that, people were asked to go and count the potholes, to go and measure them physically but they did that in the houses.  We know, we know, we see these things.  So to give a task like this to locals without training, without due referencing, without all this equipment…     It would have been done in 1994 but it wasnot because this is an exercise that needs people that are competent to do it.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     That is correct, that is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.     There is a distinction between what Human Settlements does and what the municipality does.  I accept that – I do agree that there are asbestos pipes that you do find but one needs to understand how government works and what government is responsible for.    Those pipes, you would address it with themunicipality but in this case, you address it with Human Settlements.  So the asbestos is there but what we are looking at was on the houses, not the pipes.     I am saying the pipes that were being referred to, normally those will be about pipes which are on the street, the municipality is taking care of that but from there on, if you come into the house – but I havenever seen a pipe of asbestos so there was no need for us to go to that extent.  Your focus on the house is the fascia boards, we looked into that.   The roofs, we looked into that.  The windows, I have never seen – some of the houses you will find hundred percent, even the walls is asbestos, that is the situation in Pieter Steyn.   So we look at such things.  Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    And assess, yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Matriculants that could read, write and that would demonstrate understanding.  During the training they were allowed to go and assess.     Can be approved by an expert, can be endorsed, but anyone with competency can do an assessment.     And go on site.     Yes we had people that were going on site, looking at the houses randomly.  A project of this nature an engineer cannot physically go to each and every house, no province would – it would be unaffordable that project.     That is correct.      MasterTrade approached me regarding now the quotations and say can you draft a quotation that can be submitted to Blackhead and I drafted the quotation, this was an all-inclusive quotation. My fees andMasterTrade fees also in excel and I emailed it to him     It amounted to R44 208 567,90 that was excluding vat for him to submit to Blackhead.      At that time, I did another spreadsheet for MasterTrade whereby I was showing him the profit margins.  The profit for him would be around R50million that was supposed to be his profit.  There is a similar spreadsheet Idid for him but I would not want the idea that one looks at the R44million and say minus my fees and say that was his profit, no.           It was a joint effort I sent him, I say the profit there is a spreadsheet that I did for him that showed him.  The profit joined between myself and him it will be R33million, around 33 mil, then we will split it in half ways.  He will take half, I will take half.  That was the nature of the agreement.     The expenses is what I reflected on my contract but first of all I sent him a draft I think around the 8 t h of October by email following my discussions with himsort of like an agreement we had but now transacting that to paper by email.  And on that email, I specifically asked him to edit and read and sign the draft and he did do that, he came to me it was signed but before he printed it out, he called me on the phone and we negotiated further.  But he did not tell the truth initial this was a proposal I sent to him and say send it to Blackhead and he sent to Blackhead.           Then he came back and he said Blackhead wanted a discount they were not happy they say they feel theamount is too high and by then I had sent him the draft.  So after eight to nine days sitting with the draft he edited and produced the contract that we now have in front of us, that is how the figure went down.  So initially we were supposed to go fifty, fifty but there were stories that were told that brought my fees down.      That is correct.          Please say this again.     The expenses of R9million.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     For MasterTrade historic, oh let me not rather say historically - from my experience with the projects I have worked with here.  I do not know how - what is his engagement with other people but to me MasterTrade is – I see as a broker, as a middle man that is his function.      That is my view.         In my…[intervenes]        Why did MasterTrade need me?     Because he would not have been able to render that service to Blackhead.     It is the expertise, the background.     On other projects MasterTrade he has been working as a social facilitator.  When I say socialfacilitator, I mean when there is a project, he will be someone that will go to the ward councillors, the politicians and the people and speak social issues and taking care of the politics.  That is what he has been doing.  Even on the – he made some mention about the politics he did in Pretoria saying there -giving an impression that Blackhead was aware.  Maybe he lied to Blackhead I do not want to say he lied.  That is maybe that is the information he gave Blackhead to say I did this, I did but he did not do it.  He was a social facilitator taking care of the politics onprojects.  So I thought maybe on the Free State Project he will do that but I found myself doing that in Free State he never did it.      Sorry Chair I closed the file on this thing.     We met when he needed assistance with a set of a project in Tembisa they were doing beneficiary administration there.  I gave him a quote, he paid, there is a proof of payment and I gave him an invoice.  And then there was another project in Komissiza they were doing regulisation there.  I think with Mochota Nation LTE(11;27), Tembisa was also, it was also LTE.  So he was working under those people.           So he would approach me and say brother help me but he would approach me in my capacity as the sole Director of ORI Group and I will give him a quotation it would be followed by an invoice and there will be a proof of payment.  All this things I am saying now they are discovered in the court papers everything is filled there. Our relationship with MasterTrade from the word go has always been formal.  I have never dealt with him like I willyou know dealing with my brother there with my brother there on top and say, ja.  I am not referred as a friend.      It has always been formal in business.     Yes.       And they did not have the expertise but I do not know if Blackhead was aware of that.     But I saw some papers where he wrote as if - taking all glory and the credit but he never did the work. He has always been and I will repeat that he hasalways been a social facilitator when I met him.      Yes, you know this term social facilitation is even recognised by Gauteng with regards to a tariff to PRT’s.  I think there is an item for social facilitation you do get paid to perform that task and I have seen it also withmega projects.  I remember when we were doing the King Shaka International Airport I was doing the model for that for the airports there.  There was a company that was taking care of the politics so this is a trend I can see when it comes to this mega projects.         There is a need to have someone who will make sure that - when I say they are taking care of the politics I am not referring to bribery or anything.  To make sure that the message reaches your councillors, your locals, your MEC and there is unity within the wards there is no competition.  So that will be a function of a social facilitator that is what he will do.     That is a good position Chair.      If you think of it.     Why must we…    I would say from experience Chair I have noticed that the moment the project when it is a road it goes through five or seven or eight wards I am talking about the roads now.     And the skills required maybe is ten people or seven people that is where fights starts now to say who must work there.  So you do need someone likethat on the project to you know to engage the councillors and the people on the ground.     Yes, normally with mega projects – and then you will find this informal structures erupting they call them business forums…[intervenes]        Yes, they don’t account to anyone and then the councillor cannot control those people so that is where these social people they are able to relate to them. But this is the reality of what is happening on the ground.     Yes.     The role of Mr Mpambani I think that one Mr Sodi is best equipped to explain to the Chair because Mr Mpambani was part of the JV I was reporting to them. They were my seniors.     On the ground Mr Mpambani did not do anything.           Yes.     I just want to establish something which maybe I forgot to establish, to explain.  In terms of the hierarchy of things it was the two Directors Blackhead JV and then under it, it was MasterTrade and then underneath it, it was myself.  And then across there was a manheading Zenawe, Martin Zwane it was a company on his own but also doing with the management and looking after the interest of I would say Blackhead or the JV.           But I also know there were other professionals that worked parallel to what I was doing because every time I do a report I will be required to send it through to Martin Zwane who was a project manager on there of the JV to review it and maybe and advise if I need to do one, two, three, four.  There are four reports which I submitted or those four reports…[intervenes]       Okay.     Look I want to say partly there was work which was done by a man by the name of Steve.     Yes, Steve.     Martin Zwane?     It was only Martin Zwane and Steve and when we get to there the issue of the reports, I will indicate which ones where I was given, where we worked jointly.  But the person that I was – I worked throughout with him was Martin Zwane but I am the author of all those reports, yes.    Yes, that is correct, R147.00.         Yes, that is correct.      I will not say it is a discount, no I think…     Ja, I was comfortable with what I was being paid.  I was comfortable with that R21million.      Yes, it is.     Yes, that is correct.       184.      Yes, through my nine assistant project managers, nine or ten.        It was progressive but we could train 28 people with four hours would be enough to train them and then what would happen the next day we would follow them for the whole week and see how they are performing.  And even on the system I was able to see if mistakes are being made and we correct it right there.     Yes, four hours.     Yes.     I had the quality assures, assistant project managers, district managers.  District managers these were, they were reporting directly to me, taking care of different districts.  GI special needs I was – ORI Group hired a senior project manager which is me, HOD for ORI Group.  We bought food, we hired cars, accommodation, training all these expenses were paid by ORI Group.         Was anyone necessary to…[intervenes]     To do the work.     Not in my view.     Each field worker I paid R6,50 per house.      Which paragraph is that?     The most ja ineffective will take five minutes.     They can do it in three, four minutes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes I mean a house with an asbestos roof.  I think I have lost you but I agree with what you have just asked me now.  Where are in terms of the…     Yes, I agree with that.     By also doing assessments so if you had on that gadget there was a questionnaire that the field workers would fill in needing them as per our training to say when you do assessments document all these things also.           So yes a photograph was important and it was not required by the way but it was something which we felt you know we needed proof also ourselves from the field workers and there would be that questionnaire that they would fill it in as they are doing their assessment.        Can you please say again.     Yes, I am there.     Yes.    Steve Matao when we doing the critical scope report.  He assisted in terms of contributing towards the remedial work that was needed and there were other like beyond that the work he did I never saw it.      Yes.     Mr Zwane from the preliminary reports to the final report to the houses to be prioritised reports and I think that is all the reports and with the implementationplan.  All those reports he would view them and make comments on the reports.  As a project manager on behalf of the JV.  That was his task he would make sure that the project is on track we not slacking behind and that the quality of documents were produced and other functions as project manager would perform in line with the agreement with Blackhead.           As for Steve – so Martin Zwane he was there throughout.  As for Steve he came later when it was required of him to do so to look for – what I did with him Ido not want to speculate.  I sat with Steve and Martin we look at the remedial work on this houses and jointly we compile that document together.  Beyond that it is only Martin Zwane and Blackhead that can give an indication as to what Steve did but it is correct of me to say I was aware that I was not the only person working on the project.  There were other people like Martin Zwane and Steve, I was aware.  Those two I did work with them with the project.     Chair if – let us say for arguments sake if the house is not plastered, this house is plastered, this house is plastered, this one is not plastered.  So if you were to remove the roof and replace it the house that was not plastered will just put back the bricks.  There is no additional cost of trying to repair the plaster but this house that was plastered if you remove the roof you will damagethe plaster.  So to some extent you will have to chip maybe 300,00 from the roof chip it, clean it and put back the plasters.       So that is why it is good to document it because we know it will be a cost, it will come with cost implications later on.     Yes, yes it is correct.    Please put your question again.    Okay.  Every single house what we will do we came up with a template to say the Department when we give a report on a particular house, we would want all the information to be contained on one page.  We give a design and we also give a questionnaire on what the Department would want to see.  So an example of that of what transpired is as per page number 3.   Page…    Yes.    Ja it is page number 3.    Ja FS9.  Yes.  That would be the outcome.    Yes.    Yes.    No it was not required.  It was a given from us.    Yes. ADV PRETORIUS    Yes.    It is mono-pitch.  It could be also pitch.     No it is mono-pitch and I must add it to you that to say to take those off these houses was not a requirement.  This is something we did extra.  But that iswhy it was important to go on the ground and physically look at these things.    No it is not.  It is not a bonus.    No I am saying it was a control measure on our side to enforce quality and to make sure that things are done accordingly.  So on this page you – on this report.    Yes.    No I am saying this is not something that we were paid to do but we did it for Free State.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes that was the structural.    What we will qualify as a crack to be notedhere it will be a crack that is more than 3 millimetres.  So once it has been noted here it is something that the assessor is indicated that we need to look at – we need to look at.  So there was a need for a warm body to go into the house to go into the yard and physically look at the houses.  So the people were trained as to how to assess this.  These are the cracks that you must note not just any crack.  If it is a minor crack it is left alone.  It will be recorded as no crack.    That is true Advocate hence there was a need.  If you can look at after the final audit report there was a need by province to say, guys elaborate further.  That iswhy we came with the critical scope report whereby we indicated when we talk about the crack what is it meant by that?  What must be paid attention to?  So there is that document that said it was a joint effort that we did with Steve and Martin.    To do more work in terms of assessment?    No.  What we did was final.  One from the document we produced that is why I was saying Chair I would like to go back to my observation I made on Tuesday.  As I was sitting at home watching the commission from the file the expert had because that is a similar file, I saw also the investigators were having I could see there were serious documents missing from that file.  I did not want to put it out there to say the department somehow, they need help, they need to go back to the author and say, help us put this thing together.  Because there were issues that were mentioned even by the experts of bills of quantities.  He evenmentioned to a particular rate of removing the roof.  All those rates were there.  To some extent he gave even the value of how much the project would be.  But he never mentioned a single word about replacing the roof or putting it back.  But that is a discussion for another day.  I just wanted to give that to you Chair that the work we did one needs to understand the processes that projects follow.  From inception to conceptualisation to preliminary to detail.  So it is not all projects whereby you do everything until construction drawings.Some projects you do untilpreliminary.  Others you do like until detail.  But a document that was produced here is sufficient for any contractor to tender and start working.  Well there will be other things maybe there and there that might be required but this is sufficient.  And this was discussed and agreed upon with the department to say, this is what we are going to give you and the answer was, yes go ahead and we did just that.    Yes that is correct.    Chair a crack that is worth noting will either be caused by the foundation or the roof.    And it is not every crack that you would register as a crack that is worth to be repaired.  It has to be within certain millimetres.  So as a – as a rule we gave it to them and fill in the millimetres.      So sometimes if you find a crack that is inside the house to answer your question now it does not – it is not visible on the outside.    Hey there could be a lot of debates to say is this worth noting or not?  But a crack that is worth noting is a crack that goes throughout.    Because it shows that there is a structure – there is a serious structural problems that is what the fieldworker knows.    It was a visual yes, yes it was.    I wish to make a comment.    Yes.    Hm.    We can still have another.    I can still – yes I can still participate Chair.    Of which the staff will guide me as to what needs to be done.    In terms of the protocols and so forth.    But the statement I wanted to make.    Was to – was to say – was also to help the commission.    Was to help the commission so that you know people that must account when they have to come here and they know that things are not in order.    It might be hard for them to account.    So I am appealing to them.    To say go to the author.    Get all the documents so that when you come to the commission you can speak about what you know.    That is all I am saying.    That is in closing.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I have looked at those expenses.  I have seen his expenses.    What page is it?    Hey Chair.    Chair this is the question I have been waiting for the whole day.  This question.    Yes.    What is written about these costs cannot stand in any court or anywhere because it does not exist.   And they do not be even proven.    Yes.    No.    It is not true. 
MANYIKE:It was not arrangements between contractors and the department it was an arrangement between the department and the professional resourceteams.  The assessment audit for 300 000 residential units in the Free State province.  You do not go inside the house…[intervenes] 
INQUIRY RESUMES:   
COUNSEL FOR MR SODI:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  I shall not be long and I can assure you Mr Chairperson that Mr Sodi is here to cooperate fully, there is no issue whatsoever.    Thank you.  What ...[intervenes]     Mr Chair, it is set up for Mr Pretorius.  It is unnecessary to move everything.    It is part of our spirit of cooperation.    What I would like to just put on record, if I may is that Mr Sodi has tendered his full cooperation and respect to this Commission.  There is no issue about that.    He does, however, as you in your life as the Deputy Chief Justice would appreciate havecertain constitutional rights, not before this Commission ...[intervenes]     Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Chair.    What I was saying is, Mr Sodi ...[intervenes]     Mr Sodi tenders his full cooperation.  We are working in the spirit of absolute cooperation in respect for the inquiry.    The only thing that we wish to record is to contextualise his evidence and to explain that he has, as you would appreciate in your other capacities as the Deputy Chief Justice’s rights.  Not in this Commission.  He is aware of the regulations.    Which I will refer to.  But he just wants... wanted me to record on his behalf how it came about.    And to contextualise his testimony.    So just to give you a brief chronology, so you... which does also appear from his statement but I just want to highlight a few dates.    Put a few things on record and then he... then we may commence with his testimony.  So the first notice that he received in terms of Rule 3.3 to appear here was in relation to the evidence of Mr Dukwana on the 19t h of August 2019.He then received an email from the investigator requesting an interview on the 7t h of October 2019.  That interview was attended by him and... at the offices of theinvestigators on the 22 nd of October 2019.There were then certain arrangements made and it was anticipated that he will be attending and testify on the 9t h of December 2019.  There were problems then but not on the account of Mr Sodi.  It was caused by the legal team who were not available.  So it was then decided that on the 11t h of December 19, he would receive a summons which he did.  That summons requested a date and no dates have been set in stone but we then discussed the dates.We were cooperating.  There was a request for a statement from him on the 12t h of February .  Unfortunately, we then went into the National Lockdown whilst we were in the midst of preparing that statement which commenced from the 27t h of March 2020. We worked through the lockdown Mr Chairperson and we have provided his statement that was his first statement on the 3r d of April 2020.08.07We were, subsequently, faced with a request for further additional information on the 12 t h of May 2020 which we then undertook to provide.It was difficult because of the lockdown and at the same time, and this is the major issue that I wish to place on record, was that on the 14t h and the 15t h of May 2020, we were informed that there was a criminal docket opened andthat the Free State HAWKS were investigating Mr Sodi which is the purpose of this address.We then explained that we had the difficulty obtaining certain banking records.  We were declined the records but then there was a process of negotiation and the Commission made some banking records available to us that would take us to the 15t h of June 2020 when we have received that.Subsequent to that, we have received several Rule 3.3 notices enable to prepare together with a request for further information.We were then told Mr Chairperson that we will be testifying at... sometime between the 1 s t to the 4t h of September 2020 and we agreed dates and cleared our diaries for that.We then had a meeting our attorneys’ offices at Fluxmans Attorneys with the investigators on the t h of July 2020, and we... even at that meeting confirmed that it would fit in with the dates of the 4 t h to the... the 1s t to the 4t h of September 2020.However, subsequent to that, the dates were brought forward as I am quite certain that you will be aware Mr Chairperson.  So it was moved on the 14t h of July 2020 to this week, the 3rd to the 7t h of August.  We agreed to the 7t h of August and had to clear our diaries which we then did.And the problem that we had, which does appear fromthe second statement which was provided, is not all of the information has been available or been made available to us in a short time because it was expedited.But Mr Sodi will and you will hear it from him as well under oath, provide the further information as and when he is in a position to do so once he has those documents to hand.Summons was served on the 20t h of July 2020.  What then happened is, I have no doubt that are aware, is that the Regulation 11 of the Regulations pertaining to Proclamation4 of 2020 were amended to make that evidence now applicable.Subsequent to that, on the 30t h of July we received further Rule 3. 3 notices that the people were attending.  And then on the 4 t h of August 2020, which is Tuesday of this week, we have provided Mr Sodi’s additional affidavit where there are.And I need to put on record, certain information and documents are still missing but we will make them available.  What we wish to refer to, as clearly as you Mr Chairperson you would be aware, his rights in a criminal trial.This is not a criminal trial.  He has been made aware of the provisions of the regulations and most specifically 6, 8 and 11.  Six being his right to presentation, eight being hisobligation to answer and eleven being that previously all this information was regarded a secret but now a provision is made for the sharing of information.I need to record, unless to be criticised later on Mr Chairperson that should any criminal trial be instituted against Mr Sodi in due course, it is our instructions and it is his right to then rely on his constitutional rights as embodies in Section 35 of the Constitution which protects an accused, arrested and detained persons.  He will then fit into that category that here you can berest assured and we have been assured in similar terms, Mr Sodi is here to fully cooperate and answer every question to the best of his ability on the information available and in the time available to prepare.I thank you Mr Commissioner.  May I ask one question unrelated to that?      And it is more and I... please, do not see it as an impertinence.  There was a talk of either running late today or running on another date and the election was that we would run late today if possible, with the view to finalise and getting as far as we can.  Until what time would that be just so that everyone can make necessary arrangements?     Thank you.    No, we are in a similar position. Thank you.      Thank you Mr Chairperson.    I concede that.     We had difficulty obtaining the documentation.    And there were delays in December and similarly caused by the lockdown.    That is submitted on his part.    Yes, it is fair.  It has been put on record.    Thank you.    Thank you.  Thank you very much.    Insofar as necessary, we confirm the oath.  We were present and we confirm that it took place. We have no issue with that.    Thank you. 
MR SODI:  Peane Edwin Sodi.    No objection.    Correct.    So help me God.   Okay.    That is correct.   Yes, I am there.    That is my signature.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.   Ja.    Ja, I can see it Chair.    I have got it here.   No, I got it.    Ja.   That is fine.  Which page are you going to?    Okay I am there Chair.    That is my signature Chair.   That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    It is Peane.    Ja.    I am there Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Okay I am there Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    If I can just explain that Chair?  The whole intention was to first of all to do Phase 1 which was the Audit and Assessment.  The next phase after that would have been the Implementation Phase.  So our plan was, should we be successful and get appointed for the Eradication Phase, we would have to work with an entity that is accredited to handle asbestos.So that was the plan.  It is an arrangement that was happening in the past where if a particular entity is appointed to do something but they are not accredited, they can sub-contract someone who can actually do that work on that on that deal.  So this is... this was the understanding.     Okay.      Ja, I am there Chair.    That is correct.  I am aware of it.    Chair, the... I admit that we had the necessary skills and expertise to conduct the audit and assessment but not to handle asbestos.  For that, as I have indicated Chair,you need to be accredited.  Not anyone can handle asbestos.  So the answer, the quickest answer to that is that we would not even have, you know, gone to that stage because we know we cannot handle asbestos due to the fact that we are not accredited.    Ja.  Is that the Service Level Agreement?    I am there Chair.    H’m.    Chair, unless it is a matter of perhaps, you know, misunderstanding but my interpretation of this particular clause that Mr Pretorius is referring to does not say anything with regard to being accredited.  It talks about the entity or the service provider having the necessary experience and skill to render the service.  So service in this context would have been the first phase of the project which is the Audit and Assessment.Certainly Chair, with regards to the second phase, as I have indicated, which is the actual eradication of asbestos, we do not have the necessary skill experience simple because, as I have indicated, we are not accredited to handle asbestos.So it could be that maybe you are reading it differently Chair but my understanding of what this clause is saying.    Ja.   That is fine.    Okay.    Well, I agree Chair that the client in this case, the department, wants law but we are talking two different phases of the project.  And even if Chair, the department hadto say ...[indistinct] [coughing]...    Ja.    Okay Chair.    I am saying the department, obviously, in making the appointment would have made sure that whoever they are appointing as a service provider has the necessary skill and capability to execute the project.Chair, you would recall I mentioned but even if you had to be appointed for the eradication of asbestos, that is us in this case, we would not have done that ourselves.So we would have had to find someone who is accredited and entered into some... whether some kind of a JV or a partnership and tell them to actually do the eradication.But we certainly would not have gone ahead with the eradication as it is because we are not accredited to do that. That is the point I am trying to pass across Chair.    Ja.  Look, you are absolutely correct Mr Pretorius.  Chair, as it turned out in this case, as much aswe signed the SLA, the IPW, which is an instruction to proceed with work, was issued subsequent to the SLA.  And that IPW is the actual contract.  So and it was very specific that our appointment was limited to just the auditing and assessment.  It never said anything about eradication. So the IPW in this case, takes precedence over the SLA.  So it becomes the binding document the service provider and the client.    Okay.    I have got it Chair.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.   Yes, correct.  I agree with that Chair.    Ja.    That is correct Chair.     Chair, the quick answer to that question, as I said, was we had anticipated, we made an application or request to be appointed for the two phases which is phase one and phase two, phase two being the eradication.  Even if we did get appointed for phase two, we would have had to find an accredited service provider to perform that service.  That is what would have happened. You know, the question from what I am hearing from Mr Pretorius, why would the department not go directly to someone who is accredited?     Ja.     That is correct.     Yes.     Okay.  Chair, look, I will acknowledge that.  Inretrospect perhaps we should not have asked for the department to appoint us for phase two.  And, like I said, as a tenderer, we were never appointed for phase two.   Let me perhaps just explain what happened previously.  I think it was in Gauteng, with the same concept where you have service providers who appear on the PRT panel and this is the panel where the department would go, you know, when there is a need for a service  to be provided.   And what happened previously, in this instance was that they needed in Gauteng, specifically, they needed to appoint entities to do the eradication of asbestos. However, on that panel there was not a single company that was accredited to handle asbestos.  So what they then did was to say look, because we have got nocompany that is accredited, we are going to have to appoint one of the – make some PRTs, okay, to do that but those PRTs would have then to go out to the market and find companies that are accredited, so that they can do the job and the reason for that, as I said, was because the whole PRT system all the panel system is to shorten the procurement process.   So what happened was they said look, we acknowledge that we have got no one on our panel who is accredited but we will appoint some companies that willthen have to subcontract and this was the thinking as well, from our side, you know, when we drafted this letter.  It was the same thinking.   You know, it could be criticised and I understand where the criticism, Chair, is coming from and I admit to that, you know, that, you know, it would be improper for anyone to be, you know, to be asked to be appointed to do something when you do not have the necessary, you know, skill or experience of capacity.  I take that point, sir, and I …[intervenes]     I concede to that, ja.     Yes, I concede to that, Chair.        Ja.     I do not know.     I would not have, ja.  I – no, I do not.    Correct, correct, I admit, ja.     Ja.     That is correct, sir.     You are absolute correctly, sir.     That point is taken, sir.     I admit to that.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     No, Chair, I understand.     No, no, I perfectly understand your point.     I admit to that.     Perhaps what I can just add and I do not want to labour on this or take too much time on this point but the Chair would probably be aware this whole asbestos thing really started around late 13/2014.I remember…[intervenes]     Ja.  I am talking about the actual eradication.  Now I remember very well, around 2013 or 2014 there were about – Chair, about three companies in the whole country that were accredited to handle asbestos.  There were about I think four sites, landfill sites, if I am not mistaken, in the whole country that had the necessary permit to accept asbestos.  So it was a new thing and I can understand and I am not speaking on behalf of, you know, government official that, you know, we do not really have capacity in terms of service providers that are accredited, you know, to deal with this matter.   So I suppose then that is why there was, you know,a way of being creative, if you want to – for the lack of a better to say we have a crisis we need to deal with, there is probably about three, as I said about three service providers in the whole country that can do this.  They are not going to be able to do this on their own, so you know, let us find a way that we can be able to assist.  But I do remember vividly then that that was one of the challenges that government had.  I do not know about now, that number may very well have increased but about six, seven years ago it was – you would struggle to findone, actually.  But I take the point, Chair, and I admit that, ja.     I take it.     No, absolutely, Chair.     And I do not want to talk about what could havehappened.     But had we arrived at that stage after the assessment we would have disclosed to the department.  I know we should have done it at the beginning but we would have told them that guys, we do not have the credentials, you know, we are not accredited to handle asbestos.  So we would have to go and, you know, find a partner.     But I am sure that would have happened, Chair,I mean, you know…     Ja.     It is later in the year.     Correct.     Okay.    Yes, ja.     I take the point, sir.     Absolutely, Chair.     Okay.     Did you say page 467?     Definitions and interpretations, okay.  I do not see where you …[intervenes]    Ah yes, okay.  I see that.     That is correct.  That is correct, Chair.     I see that, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Ja.     Chair, I have to mention here that I never discussed or have any discussions with the department with regard to the contract.  My late partner is the one who was having this kind of negotiations.  It may very well be that at some stage he may have disclosed to the department that we are not accredited forasbestos and maybe that is why it will explain the reason that we only got an IPW – sorry, we got an IPW for the assessment and all that.   So with regard to the, you know, the discussions with the client, I have never had discussions with them.  The only time that I got to interact with the client and specifically one individual, who is the HOD, was when the project was already being implemented and my interaction really was more to find out if the deliverables are indeed what they are looking for and if we are, you know, meetingthe level of standard that they are expecting. So, Chair, to answer the question, I do not know if that discussion ever took place.     Ja, I do not, ja.     Chair, I would not know if, you know, it would have given the department the opportunity to interrogate theprice, I unfortunately cannot speak on behalf of the department certainly with regard to that aspect.     Like I said, I was not party to the discussions, Chair, and I cannot confirm if discussions every took place or never took place as I was never involved with, you know, discussing the contractual matters with the department.  I would not know if that actually happened.     Ja, look, we, Chair, we submitted – we proposed at least in as far as phase one of the project isconcerned, we proposed a fee, whatever it.  In the initial – I think the initial letter or proposal that we submitted to the department – and I can speak to that because certainly I was involved, with the drafting of the proposal.   The initial figure that we proposed for the actual assessment was about 1 350.  That is what we submitted to the department and it was submitted as a hard copy by my late partner.Subsequent to that, he came back and said the department has mentioned they cannot afford that rate andthey settled on R850 per stand and that is what we eventually were appointed on, for phase one.  So ja, the discussion with regard to the fees was handled, as I said, by Mr Mpambani.     It is a big difference, ja.     Ja.  And maybe, Chair, if you can allow me maybe two or three minutes.     Just to give a context to this thing, maybe to assist us with some of those questions.    So in late 2013, there was a huge storm in Gauteng which destroyed a lot of houses.  This was around December of 2013.  The department of human settlements appointed contractors to go and fix these houses.What was discovered was that a lot of these houses that were damaged were actually roofed with asbestos.  Because it was roofs that were blown away and, you know,and so forth.  So that is what led to the department say hold on, why do we not take stock and understand the nature of the problem that we are dealing with because most of these houses are asbestos roofed houses and this would be houses that would have been constructed pre-1994.  This is now what led to the actual, you know, assessment to say we need to plan, we want to plan, and we also want to eradicate and the only way that we can be able to understand what is on the ground, what the problem is, is to actually get people to go literally door to door, street by street and verify and come back and tell us, say Department of Human Settlements, you have got so many houses in Gauteng that are roofed with asbestos.   That would have enabled them obviously to then plan, you know, to make sure that they put the necessary,you know, budgets in place and start with the eradication because they would not have able to put a budget without knowing what sort of quantities they are talking about.  So that is what led to this assessment and audit project which started in late – sorry, I think it started in 2014.   Now what happened then was the department appointed eight contractors from their panel.     So it is taking me to – and it is important that Imention this.     Because it is taking me to the question that you asked.     Now that appointment – those appointments were very specific.  Department said listen guys, we are appointing you to go out there and do an audit and come back and tell us what we are sitting with or what we are dealing with.   You are going to be appointed at this rate, all of you.  Okay, you either take it or you leave it and also, do not come back and tell us that you need variation, this is a price that we are giving.     All of you.    Like a variation, you cannot come back and say.     Ja.  For instance, this then audit 50 houses.     And you find 100 houses.     You cannot come back and say guys, I found an additional 50 houses, please pay me for those houses.    So that is what is what I am referring to.     So that was very clear to say this is the rate, it has been predetermined and we – there is a way that they said we determine this rate which obviously we would not have known but, I mean, they would have used …[intervenes]     That is correct, so …[intervenes]     No, no, it was R650.     It was R650.     Per house.     So that is the rate that was given to all of us.     I mean, at that point in time, I mean – so we get disappointments, I do not know whether I am going to make money or lose money and we accept - you know, we take the rate and we – obviously this is the first time, so this hasnever been done at least in government.  So it is really trial and error but we know what needs to be done, so we acquire the necessary gadgets, the necessary software, we employ, you know, the fieldworkers, we do what needs to be done and that is what happened.     Ja.     Okay, so now – and this is the point that I want to make to you, Chair.  Two things.  One is, in Gauteng we were appointed for certain parts of Soweto and it is easier to get in and out.  Logistically it is not a problem, you know, there is not much travelling, you know, that is going tohappen, you do not need to be booking accommodation for people that are going to be working there, especially your technical people because we are in the province, you know, so we are working here so it makes it easy.The Free State, on the other hand, we are now appointed for the entire province and as you may know, Chair, you can travel from one township to the next, you know, it can take you up to three hours.  Those are the dynamics that we did not have in Gauteng.  There were a lot of unknowns that we factored in.  Give you another example, in Gauteng we were appointed to – I think it was about 250 000 units.  We ended up auditing about 200 000 more but we were only paid for the 250 000 and now here we are talking the Free State and we are told that you are going to audit 300 000 structures, the whole province.   Knowing what we knew already, we anticipated that the chances are that we are going to find more, that is what we thought, we thought if just in one township we did 0 000 more, now we are talking the entire province.  So there is a bigger chance based on that experience but we could end up maybe doing double that number or even triple that number.  So this is sort of what influenced that.     Absolutely, absolutely.     What page is that?     Correct.     That is correct.     Yes, it is the …[intervenes]     Yes.     I conceded to that one, sir.     You are referring to the first bundle, am I right?     Okay.     Okay, is it page 468?    Okay.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     Chair, I certainly did not inform the Department that we were going to sub-contract the work.  I, Chair, was more concerned about being able to deliver on the project, that was my primary focus.  Again, like I said, I wouldn’t know, if my partner, who was instrumental in engagement with the officials on contractual matters, would havedisclosed but from my point of view, personally, I did not have that discussion with anyone in terms of that.     No, we did not give the department a breakdown of the costs.  What happened, Chair, was, we agreed with the Department on the rate payable per house and that is where it ended with the Department but we didn’t say, to them, you know, this is how the 850, forinstance is broken down, no we didn’t go that far.     So the feedback, Chair, that I got from Mr Mpambani was that he came back and he said that the Department had indicated that they will not afford the rate that we proposed, which was R1350, he said they negotiated and agreed and settled on R850.     Chair, I’m not sure if I understand this question, do you want to…     There was no competitive bidding process yes, I agree with that.     No, no,  I agree with – that there was no competitive bidding at least when it comes to the Free State appointment.     Ja, Chair, certainly with – as far as I know that was never requested or – because that is a scope that fall in phase 2 but they were certainly comfortable that we had the necessary skill and expertise to execute phase 1 of the project, which is the whole reason why the Treasury Regulation 16(A) 6.6 was utilised because they were aware that we had done a similar project.     I’m not sure, it may…[intervenes].     No, I…[intervenes].     I don’t accept that sir. I accept that the Service Level Agreement that was signed between the two parties referred to both phase 1 and phase 2 but the instruction to do work was only phase 1, which is what I said is theactual contractual document between the Department and the service provider which supersedes the SLA.     Yes, correct ja.     That’s correct.     Well, Chair, I probably have a different understanding and I’m certainly not disagreeing with Mr Pretorius or…[intervenes].     Yes, ja, that’s right.     Thank you for the education.     Ja.     This is the first Bundle?     Okay.     So, Chair, in 2009 the Department of LocalGovernment and Housing…[intervenes].     That is Gauteng, issued out an invitation to bid for Engineering firms to be on their panel for professional resources. We, Chair, it was a bid that was out in the newspapers, we responded to the bid and we submitted our bid.  It was, obviously, you know, evaluated and we were appointed on the panel.  I think that appointment happened about 2010 and the duration of that panel was three years, effective from around 2010 but I do know that it wasextended from time to time right up to, I think, about 2014 or so, that’s my understanding.     Okay.     This is exactly, Chair, in line with what I said was my understanding with Service Level Agreement was that, often, like in this case it is broad, it’s not specific in terms of what kind of service must be offered.  Those kind of details will then be produced in an instruction to proceed with work.  So, I admit that this Service Level Agreement which was signed in 2010 is very broad, it doesn’t talk to what ought to happen, that gets to be produced elsewhere.     That’s absolutely correct Chair.     Right.     These – let me explain it this way. So, Chair,we are talking here about a panel for the Department of Human Settlements. So, essentially, what that means is that if the Department choose to create a panel, they are saying, anything that has to do with Human Settlement will be contained in broad terms in the SLA.  The specifics of what needs, or ought to happen will then be produced through an IPW but anything else related to Human Settlement will then be covered in the SLA, as I said, in broad terms.  So, you would find that the composition of your PRT, for instance, to give you an example, would be Civil Engineers, would be Structural Engineers, Town Planners, which would be Environmentalists, it would be Geo Technical Engineers. So that would typically, what would consist a professional resource team.  So if you look at, Chair, a lot of the PRT’s you’ll find that, not onecompany, in most cases – very few companies that go on their own and say we are a PRT on our own.  You’d find that in most cases you would have to then, you know, get into a partnership with other entities that can provide services within Human Settlement.   To give you an example, when we submitted this bid in 2009, we wouldn’t have met the requirements if we went in purely as Blackhead Consulting because at that point in time, we only had Civil Engineers, we had Project Managers and I think we had Structural Engineers.  The bidwas very specific in terms of the requirements that you need to have a full suite of all those services.  So, when they do their adjudication when the client does the adjudication, Chair, they will say, okay fine we see there is a Blackhead Consulting PRT and if you are the leading PRT you can just use your name. For instance, we were the leading member of the consortium if you want to call it that but the thing with consortium there were other companies that formed part of our bid which provided services that we did not have in-house. So when you then get to be appointed, the adjudication will be based on whether or not you meet that criteria and you are able to demonstrate that you have all those other services that are required. So this SLA, Chair, would not have been specificthat one of the things that you do, for instance is asbestos eradication.  It also wouldn’t have been specific but one of the things that you would do is, maybe, Geo Technical Investigation, that will come along should there be a need for such a service and the only reason why the Department of Human Settlement would have dealt with this asbestos matter, is because it is within Human Settlements, the roofs are on houses which is Human Settlement. So this SLA would not have been specific to that extent Chair to specify that you know you need to have, for instance,expertise in handling asbestos or at least in the assessment of it.     I’m there Chair.     That’s correct, that’s correct Chair.     Okay Chair.     Gee, Chair, this was like ten years ago, so I wouldn’t…[intervenes].     I think it was – I won’t be accurate but it was anywhere between 50 and 100.     Ja they usually are. ADV PRETORIUS     Chair, as far as I know, no, he didn’t have …[intervenes].     Chair, his – I mean I can safely say that his knowledge of the asbestos matter was very limited.     But I’m certain…[intervenes].     Ja but I certainly can’t rule out the fact that he may have known he was a very smart, intelligent man so it’s possible that he may have known.     I don’t remember that discussion.     It may, very well have happened Chair, but I don’t seem to remember.     Events that, you’d appreciate Chair, happened many years ago.     So some of the things we may recall some – ja, so I don’t want you – make a conclusive…[intervenes].     Are you referring to 9.8, do you want me to comment on 9.8?     I’ve – Chair I think…[intervenes].     I mentioned it already.     Chair, I remember this period very well because I had never seen anything like that, I mean, the storm that happened in December of 2013 was hectic and a lot of the houses, a lot of the roofs were blown away and this was during the festive period and it continued raining and people had nowhere, because now the roofs are blown away and it was a disaster for a lot of the residents.   I mean I remember visiting one township I think it was in Kagiso something like that.  It was – it was too painful to watch you know.  And it continued raining and obviously people could not stay in those houses.  Now this is what led to – as I said this is what led to the department to say, if we look – if we do an assessment of most of the houses that aredamaged here probably about 90% of them were roofed with asbestos.  So you would find that if you walk street by street you would find a house with a roof blown away that was used – you know that was asbestos roof.  But next door for instance it is a house which is tiled and nothing has happened to it.  And this is why they said, look clearly because of I suppose the age of some of the houses and the asbestos roofs this is a problem and we do not want to be caught off guard again you know and expose our residents to things like this.  So we need to be proactive.  Obviously,there were reactive as a result of what happened you know but then they decided, listen instead of being reactive in future let us plan properly okay?  Apart from the fact that – like I said some of these houses are very old I mean the majority of them if not all were built prior to 1994.  There was a health problem you know that you actually exposing people that are living in those properties to health – to you know health issues.  And I think it was – it was a cautious decision which in my view was the right decision to make to say, guys let us deal with this problem once and for all.  I do not know if Chair if they have been able to eradicate asbestos in all the houses but I do know that certainly there was an effort from the department’s point of view to say, let us deal with this issue and deal with it once and for all.  Obviously there would be budgetary constraints so – but Ithink the idea was that for – if we can afford it or depending on the resources that you know the amount of resources that we put let us deal with it and make sure that this problem is sorted once and for all.    Correct, correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chair that is what led to thatprocess.  As I have indicated it was obviously preceded by the contractors who were then appointed to fix the roofs as a matter of urgency.  And then said, look now that this is done now that we – our people are okay, they have gone back to their houses, the roof – you know the roofs are sorted let us now do this thing properly.  And that is what led Chair to the appointment of these eight contractors to say, guys please go out there in all the townships and come back – come back and tell us what we sitting with or what we dealing with?  So that we will then be able to plan and budget properly based on the information that we have got.  And that was the whole idea for the exercise to conduct the audit.    If my memory serves me well Chair it was around that ja – around 2014 ja.    Well Chair what I do know was that I certainly speak for – for ourselves at Blackhead but I think this is what happened with all the other eight contractors we were basically called to a meeting and said, guys you have been selected from the panel okay.  Here are the IPW’s you go out and do what you need to do.  So that is – that is the processthat was followed Chair.    The process as I understand it was by reference to an existing panel.    Ja. So…    Absolutely, absolutely Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I am seeing this document for the first time Chair.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Ja Chair unfortunately my file does not have that page but I appreciate that you read it out I do not have it here.    It does not have page 91 but I think I am fine Inkosi.   Ja there is a page missing.    Ja I have got it now.    I see that.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    I have got it Chair.    Well Chair you would need someone competent and qualified I may add to make a conclusive opinion on the structural integrity of the house.  And that would typically be an engineer.  And so I would agree with that that we need a competent to do that.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Sir.  So you need to get a competent person to make a determination that if you removing asbestos and perhaps replacing that with a tiled roof that the you know the load bearing walls would be – you know adequate enough to be able to carry that structure because otherwise you might just be creating another problem if you have not made that assessment.  And that cannot just be made by anyone.  It has got to be – and this is why it qualified here but it has got to be a competentperson.    I am – yes and no.  I am saying perhaps no because we pretty much know the standard or the sizes of these houses.  You know a lot of them are exactly the same size.  If you look at for instance the RDP houses maybe 90% of them are all 40 square meter houses.  So if you know thesize of the house already it would be pointless to go and get someone to still come and measure it because it is already given.  The plan will tell you that these are 40 square meters so you do not really need someone to come and verify.  You can verify but you know it is – if the plan is there and it tells you the size that is sufficient and therefore an engineer can then based on the size that can be able to design the roof of that particular house.    That is correct Chair.    We can move on Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Ja that is what I mentioned to the Chair earlier and again I do not want to re-emphasise this point but I just want you – again coming back to the issue that the question that you raised and it has been raised many times about the rate that we charged specifically in the Free State.  Wasbecause we knew we had the experience of what we encountered in Gauteng we had to put that in mind when we approached the Free State.  And this was one of them.  Because like I said it was very – it was made very clear and very specific in no uncertain terms by Gauteng but guys you are – your appointment is for x number of houses.  If you come back and you have done more – it does not matter how much more or how many more it is neither here nor there you will still be paid for the original scope that we paid.  It was an experience that we had and we said, look because nowyou have an experience you are applied for future which is what you know you would normally do in any circumstances.  You learn – you learn from the past so that you can be able to apply lessons for the future.  So – so we had to factor that in Chair because of this – of this discrepancy here.    No.    Ja.    Ja.  Chair it is an exercise that had to be done in the Free State but even then, it was inaccurate.  Because what ended up happening was that the number of houses that were audited actually exceeded that 300 000.  I cannotremember the exact number.  So one had to be careful there to say, what we have is the minimum number of houses that they know these ones are definitely there.  But you may very well find that there is more than that.    Ja.    Chair we would have preferred that because – because then otherwise you know you just focus on your scope.  But as we had learnt in Gauteng it was not the case.  It was – if they say go to this particular township.  According to our records we have 100 000 houses okay and that iswhat we are appointing you for.  So you go there and do the audit.  If you find 200 000 houses for instance and because maybe their records might be old or inaccurate.    So if you find more, they made it very clear.    That is your problem.    But you must still audit them.    But you are not going to be paid for them.    You understand Chair.    So that was the whole thing.    I have got it Chair.    Chair, it must have been around 2010/2011.  Somewhere around there.    Ja, it was at a function.  So Mr Mpambani and his ex-partner... I cannot remember his name Chair.  But they... at an event, it was an annual event which happened every December.  It was quite popular.  There is one December, I cannot recall exactly which December it was, but I got tempted to go and check it outand I drove there and that is where I met him.  We exchanged numbers and kept in touch, you know, on the odd occasion right up to 2014 when we now officially met.I cannot describe that kind of relationship as being friendship because it is someone that I just knew as a businessperson who have this... what at the time seemed to be quite a successful event taking place.  Ja, that is...    That is how it came across.  He came across because I recall that at that event Chair when I was there, I saw a few couple of faces.  You know, I cannot recall exactly who they were but the people... the faces that I saw there and I concluded that he is highly-network based on my observations there.    Sorry, what was the question again?    Can you just repeat the question Mr Pretorius? ADV PRETORIUS    Ja?    Chair, I received a call.  I think it was around February 2014.  I received a call from Mr Mpambani and he asked if he could come and see me.  And of course, I knew him and I said, “Ja, sure.  Come and see me”.   I was at my house.  He came to my house.  And he said, “Look, I am aware that you are busy with this Asbestos Auditing in Gauteng.  I would want to go and pitch the idea for a similar exercise in the Free State”.And this was someone that I could see that he knew what he was talking about because he said to me that I am aware that this eventually... this is supposed to be a national project.  It is supposed to be done in all the provinces where there are houses that have roof asbestos.  And I knew that myself.And he said, “Look, because you are already doing it here, you have got experience.  Do you mind if we partner together for the Free State?”My answer was I do not have a problem with that because I also knew that at some stage the provinces were going to follow suit.Gauteng happened to be the pioneer.  It had not been done by any other province.  So Gauteng was the pioneer.  But I knew that eventually it was going to... it is going to be rolled out in other provinces because there was... I also knew about a cabinet decision that was taken many years ago pertaining the use of asbestos and eradicating asbestos.So I was aware about these things and being a businessperson, I thought this is an excellent opportunity.  Here is this person who comes to me.  I never thought of going to the Free State.But he says, “Look, I am from there.  I grew up there.  I know for a fact that there are so many houses that are roofed with asbestos.  So I think there is opportunity.  Do you mind if I, you know, go and pitch the idea and see if the Free State government is keen or interested”.Of course, my answer Chair was “go ahead”.  And that is what happened.  He told me that he went to the Free State.  In his own words he spoke to the relevant officials.  I did notwant to ask the names because I could see that he was keeping that to himself that these, you know, relevant officials.“Do not worry about who they are but I have spoken to relevant officials”.  And he came back and he said, “Look, the suggestion is that we must submit a report”.  Okay.And that is what led to the initial letter, I think that we wrote Chair.  It could have been February.  Sorry, my dates might be mixed there but there was... subsequent to that meeting when he came back, we wrote a proposal andsubmitted it.He took it and hand delivered in the Free State.  And that was the beginning stage of the Free State Project.  It started there.  And he, obviously, engaged with whoever that he was engaging with. So from February, when we first wrote the letter Chair, the process, the entire process really leading to our appointment and the signing of the SLA was taking about ten months, give or take because it was only around, I think, around October, somewhere around there when the SLA was signed.But there were to-and-from letters and so forth and so on.  So I was under the impression that this process that is being followed is the right process, you know, and hence it is taking so long.And of course, I was aware about the letters that we have written for instance the Free State, addressing the letter to Gauteng, to... I was aware.  I saw some of those correspondence.So in my mind, that was a process and they had to make sure that it is followed properly.  Hence, it took so long for the JV to be ultimately appointed.But during that process, it was him, Mr Mpambani who was, you know, running around and meeting with whoever he was meeting to make sure that things happen.   That is correct, sir.  He did mention that he is speaking to relevant officials in the Free State and that is where it ended.      Chair, I actually used his exact words here.  You know, he said, “I will try and unlock this opportunity in theFree State”.  My understanding of what he meant was that he was going to engage and pitch the idea, you know, so that it ... that could then lead our appointment.  That was my understanding.But as I say, I use his exact words which is what he said to me.  But my understanding was that he was going to pitch the idea, engage with them and which is what I believed what happened Chair ultimately.    Ja, because... absolutely Chair.      Because he said in one meeting that he engaged them and they appreciated that he did.  There is a problem with asbestos.  He also mentioned, if I recall correctly Chair, that their concern was that, as much as they want to implement this programme, it was not in their budget for that financial year.He mentioned that and he said that there is a process which they mentioned will be undertaking but it is going to be a lengthy process.I did not mind whether it is was going to be ten months or twelve months because I was busy in Gauteng.  I was busy with another project.  So I allowed him to do what he was supposed to do.   Chair, I do not know about removing the obstacles but what he said to me ...[intervenes]     [laughs]  This unlock...    I do not want to entertain that much.  But this is the interesting thing.  So what he said when he came, he said, “Look, when I brought this topic, when I mentioned this thing, immediately they said we know, we are aware”.So it does not look like there was any convincing that happened there Chair because already they knew.  And I think they would have known, I would assume, that for instance a province like Gauteng is busy with a similar project.I mean, these are all, you know, sort of departments reporting to the same ministry and I know that they have got this quarterly meetings, you know.They call them... I think it is called Min-MEC.  So ministers and MEC’s.  So they will meet, I think, every quarter.  And a minister for a particular department would meet with the MEC’s for those departments from the various provinces and that is where information would be shared, exchanged, you know, seeing what other provinces are doing and so forth.So I would imagine that the Free State would have known that there are other provinces that are... there is another project.    Chair ...[intervenes]     It... you could.... ja, it... you could very well be right Chair.    You could very well be right.    I ...[intervenes]     Yes, exactly.    Exactly.  And just adding onto that Chair.  I know that he not only went to Free State.  He went to other provinces.  I know he went to Mpumalanga.  He went to the Northern Cape because he came and told me.  You know, I have got meetings there.  Like I said, this was... he was a smart guy and like I said he was highly-networked.  So he was able to criss-cross the country and...And I found that that is one thing that I admired about him because it was like, you know, there is something that I can learn from this guy, you know?    And I took a liking to him, you know.  That is why for me it was not a difficult thing Chair to just work because I could that he see that he possessed something that I did not have.So the unlocking this aspect for me was to say, “Listen, I am able to jump certain hurdles for instance and go to the decision-makers”.  I, you know, I would not have to go and speak to a junior official who has to speak to his boss and speak to a boss.    I can go speak to someone.   That is how I understood it.    That I can go and speak to someone who has got authority to say yay or nay.    You know, that is how I understood it Chair.,    Chair, that was the intended objective.  Like I have indicated, the other provinces where you... you were not appointed.  At least three or four provinces that he went to, only one province was a success.  Let me put it that way.  So that would have been the intended goal Chair, you know, to get appointed eventually, you know.    So again Chair, what I understood by that was that because he has got access to the key decision makers, he is able to get quicker answers.  You know, if something was going to, I am sure they will be able to tell them straight away but this is going to work or this is not going to work.You know, if perhaps the obstacle in this case may be    Sorry, who represented who?    Oh, okay.  Chair, it was myself as a director of Blackhead Consulting and Mr Ignatius Mpambani as the Director of Diamond Hill.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    Chair, this is what I envisaged right at the beginning when we started having this discussion.  With regard to the contract, Blackhead executed... when I say Blackhead, I mean Blackhead employees executed that problem.We only appointed one person from outside the company, Mr Zwane to, you know, to lead the technical team,you know, based on his technical experience but we used our own internal resources to execute the project.We acquired the gadgets that we need, the software and so forth.  When I had the discussion with Mr Mpambani, I already knew... because it was not something that he hid from me.I knew that he had never done this before and he was upfront about it and he did not have the expertise to do it.  And that is, I would imagine sir, the only reason why he would have come to me.  He could have gone to anyone elsebut he came to me because he knew that we already doing this project in Gauteng.What... and this again illustrates my point which I will come to later but this MasterTrade thing came much later.  In actual fact, I was very reluctant even go that route. You know, he came to me and said to me, “Look, I have got this friend.  He has done this kind of work before.  His business is slow at the moment and he needs some kind of work to keep him going”.  You know.This was probably Chair in the last quarter.  Probably maybe around October or so when he came with this idea.  It was all along.The plan was that we would execute this project.  I would still do it the same way that we have done in Gauteng.  But what would happen, maybe to answer this questionquickly and come to the MasterTrade thing, was that we would... we would obviously factor in all the costs associated with the implementation.So if I was going to use all my resources for instance, we would charge time and... you know, on the expenses and whatever costs that are associated ultimately on the project.And whatever then remains after having taken out all the costs, whatever then remains will then be shared equally between the two parties.That was the intention.  It was that we will do...remember, he came and presented the opportunity to me and I was quite happy to go on a fifty... on an equal, you know, sharing of the project with him.But I knew that we were going to do most of the work, and like I have said, ultimately the intention was that we would then the draw out the costs or take out all of the costs and whatever remains and then share with him.I did not anticipate that he was going to bring any meaningful resources to the project really, except that we could have said for instance, you know, where we need... as an example Chair but if we go to one particular township and we say that we must employee field workers.Let us say we employee fifty.  We could have got into an arrangement where we say, you know, if it is fifty, thirty-five is, you know, it is from... it is your cost and the other twenty-five is my cost.  You know, we could have done it that way.  But that was not... I did not want to complicate things that way.  I was quite happy that we would do the work, we will draw the cost of doing business and whatever remains.    Ja.    Do you mind Chair if I just finish on that point, the point that I touched on MasterTrade?   Or is it maybe... is it premature?    Okay.  So I was saying, just to finish it off, if you do not mind.  That... so ultimately what happened was towards just before we could actually start with the implementation of the project in the Free State, he then comes to me and convince me to listen to this MasterTrade.  To listen to the presentation and be there.  And I said, “Well, it is okay.  Let me go and listen to the presentation”.  And the presentation happened from MasterTrade representedby Mr Radebe and Mr Manyike who was here and they certainly at that point in time represented themselves to be both coming from MasterTrade so it was never disclosed to me but actually these are two different contracts.  They said we are from MasterTrade, we have done this work before, we can demonstrate what we have done and you make your decision and they presented and I was convinced that they could do the work.The one thing that was a big concern for me and this is what I said to Ignatius after the meeting because Idid not want to raise it during that meeting.  After the meeting I said to him I am worried that these guys will not be able to execute this project on that cost proposal that they presented, which was R44 million.  I said to him, I said I do not think – I have my doubts and I am talking from experience, so I want you because Sidi is your friend, I want you to go speak to him and verify that and just make hundred percent sure that they will be able to execute the project.And that is what happened, he went to him and he came back, he said this guy says they can do the job and I then said well, look, we already, you know, given our – agreed on a rate with the department I think at that time and here these guys are saying they can do this thing for 44.  Look, as a businessman I said to them like, you know,what do we do, do I go back to the department and say hey, that rate is too high, reduce it because we have got someone who can do it here for, you know, far much less?  I will be honest, I did not do that.  But what I did, I brought in Martin who was the late in the project that we did in Gauteng.  I said Martin, I want you to be my eyes and ears, I want you to oversee this project.  Yes, we are appointing a subcontractor but I want to be comfortable that we will still be - I am convinced I can do the job but I want you to be there and monitor, soeverything else that happens they must be accountable to you, they must report to you and nothing should go out without you verifying. And this is where this whole, you know, thing, this is how it happened.  It was only much later, Chair, some months down the line, when I was told that there is a dispute between ORI and MasterTrade.   I am like but who is ORI?  You know?  Who is ORI?  And they said ORI is – it is Kgotso and MasterTrade is Sidney, I said but hold on, I am under the impression these people work for the same entity.  Said no, it is not the case and I took issue with my late partner.  I took issue with him, I said but why were you not honest with me about this arrangement?  You will see later on as well, Chair, that …[intervenes]    I confronted Mr Mpambani about that.     Ja and asked him why were you not honest about this arrangement, surely, I mean, Sidney is your best friend.They were best friends with Sidney from MasterTrade.  I am sure you knew all along that these people are from different entities and his answer was like, well, I did not think it was necessary to disclose thatinformation and that is where I started picking up the dishonesty coming from my partner but as you will see later on as well, Chair, that I discovered even, you know, worse, that this guy was the wrong person to even start working with and that is why, you know, we went into civil action with this company, details of which, you know, are before court as we speak.But I just wanted to paint that scenario, Chair, so that you understand because I was concerned.  First of all, I was concerned about the cost proposal from MasterTrade and I raised it because I just did not – I did not think that they were going to be able to execute the project [indistinct – dropping voice]     I know you are tired, Mr Pretorius.     Correct, I heard those today for the first time,     I would say so, certainly so, Chair, that from my side I was as honest as I could be with Mr Mpambani.  I mean, even when he approached me, if I was not an honest person I could have simply said to him listen, you do not have the skill or the experience to do this project, you know, maybe for your efforts take 20 percent of the – I could have done that, you know?  But I am a fair person and I consider myself to be a fair person and most partnerships that I get into, I – it is mostly equal basis, 50/50 or 49/51.  So but I realised much later that I was inpartnership with someone who was not honourable.     That is correct, ja.     That was his initial role to pitch the idea and sell, you know …[intervenes]     As I said earlier on, Chair, that was the intended objective.     That is – again, it talks to the second pointthat if there were issues in between, you know, if maybe there are - for instance, if there is more than maybe one decision-maker – let us say there is two or three, that he would make sure that maybe he goes to all of them, you know, and get the buy-in, you know, that is how I understood it.     That is correct, Chair.    I came to know of people in the department who were looking after the project, so this project manager and the chief engineer.  I never met them but I knew from Martin that the reports are presented to the chief engineer, who was – I think he said he is Mr Makeba, but I never met these officials even to this day.  I have never met them.     Chair, I think I was in – the correspondence was with one official, it was just the HOD.     Mr Tim Mokhesi and I never met Mr Mokhesi up until the project started running.  So the correspondencewas – it was letters, I think it was – you know, it was a few letters that were exchanged between I think Mr Mokhesi and myself but physically we had never met, right up until the project started, that is when I got to meet him.  But beyond Mr Mokhesi, I have never met any other official from the department from the Free State.     So, I have – Chair, I have alluded to this pointthat after our meeting, you know, he indicated that he was going to meet the relevant officials in the Free State and then he came back and he said that we should submit a proposal, that is what he was advised, that we should submit a proposal and that started the whole chain of events for the next ten months almost.     That is what he said, Chair.     It was prepared, Chair.     That is correct, Chair, he took a hard copy and delivered it himself    I know this document, Chair.     Ja, I know it.     Yes.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, that is correct, Chair.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct.     Are you on page 464?     Page 384?     Okay, okay.      Alright.     No, I think I am lost, which page are we at now?     Okay, I am there.    Okay, we received a letter from the Free State  appointing Blackhead as PRT to the department.     Okay, which page is the letter …[intervenes] ADV PRETORIUS     Okay, I have gone through it.     That is correct.     Chair, what I understand this letter – this is my understanding of what this letter is all about, is if you look at the heading.  This heading is similar to the appointment that we got from the National Department of Human Settlements, appointing was onto their panel.  So myunderstanding is that what this letter seeks to do is to extend thereupon and it says there in bullet point number one that” “The department wishes to extend your current contract secured by National Department of Human Settlements in line with Treasury regulations.” So this is what the Free State department had done secure but our contract must be extended from national to the provincial Department of Human Settlements.     I will try and be brief.     Not as far as I know, Chair.     Exactly, that is my understanding, Chair, that, you know, our contract from national was extended to the province.     H’m.     That is correct, Chair.    That is correct.    Chair we - at a contract we are appointed onto the panel at National Department of Human Settlements, so the contract would refer in this instance to us as Blackhead Consulting together with the department.       The National Department, to be on the panel.      That’s correct Chair.      That is correct      Chair my memory is probably going to fail mehere.      I think it was around 2013, I could be wrong, but that letter ...[intervenes]       Ja, I think it would have, ja I think it was the year before, if my memory serves me well I think it was the year before, but it will be easy to find that appointment letter, so that at least we are sure about the actual date.      I would have it.      Chair I think, I could be wrong, but I think you dealt with this letter yesterday when Mr ...[intervenes]      Yes, that’s the letter.  That is the one, you dealt with it yesterday.     Chair there would have been an SLA I think.     Ja.       I cannot say for sure, you know but ...[intervenes]      No definitely, there definitely would have been an SLA, because typically what happens is when you getappointed ...[intervenes]      To a panel you will sign a service level agreement, so I am sure that a service level agreement can be found.     I will look for it, but ...[intervenes]       That is correct, that is correct Chair.     You are absolutely correct Chair.      No absolutely yes, that is correct.  That is correct Chair.      Yes.      Yes, yes, sorry about that.     That is correct Chair.        I see that.      Chair maybe I should try and ...[intervenes]      Exactly.     Ja, it is late in the afternoon.       That is correct Chair.      That is correct Chair.      That is correct Chair.      That is correct Chair.     Can you just assist me with the page where we are now?       Okay, alright.  20.4 you said?     That’s correct Chair.       That is correct Chair.         Okay, so we got on the 1 s t of October received a letter appointing the JV as a service provider for the asbestos eradication.      I take it.      So we are saying here that between the 1 s t of October Chair 2014 and the 2 n d December of 2014 the JV conclude an SLA with the Free State Department in terms of which the Free State Department appointed the JV to carry out the asbestos audit.      Just repeat the question.      That is correct.     I see that.         Ja, Chair can I just maybe explain the mechanics of you know IPW and how they’re structured, especially relating to the payments, so the – IPW’s are very specific in terms of how payment is supposed to happen, it says 40% of the total value of the project shall be paid to a service provider, up front, and the balance of the 60% shall be paid to the service provider upon the completion of the project and the reports and deliverables being submitted.   So that is how they structured, I am not sure about now, but I mean certainly having done you knowextensive work in Gauteng, which I got to later understand was the pioneer in terms of setting up this IPW structure.  That is how it worked.The requirement usually upfront would be at least submit a programme implementation plan.   If there is an inception report on the project that you are doing you submit that and so forth, but the nature of it was that 40% would be up front and then the balance would be paid once the work is complete.So to give you an example, there are projects for instance, that we certainly did, which could take up to two years to be completed, and I think that is how it was conceptualised, to say look you know there are certain things that you have got to understand that it would take time, not because the service provider is slow, or maybethey don’t know what they are doing, but because maybe these other inter-dependants, maybe there is another department that must approve, so there was a realisation that it was structured in such a way that to ease the cash flow of the service providers we assist them with the payment for the 40% upfront, and then only once they have done with the work or the project they can claim for the balance.To give you another example if you had to let’s say establishing a township, you know a lot of things requireEIA, the environmental impact assessment, that process to get you now a report finalised on average takes anything between 12 an 24 months, so for instance you could be appointed now, they say go to an EIA on this project, and you do whatever you have to do, the investigations, and you get specialists to come and assist you, but you only get paid once the report comes out, and that process can take very long, and I think that’s why this model was put in place to say we want to be fair to the service providers and assist them with the cash flow.  And that is the whole idea Chair for the payments to be structured in that way.      Well that could very well be Chair, ja.      Okay, I am there.      That is correct Chair.     Ja, I understand what the paragraph means and I can explain it Chair.       Ja, so when Mr Mpambani came back to give me feedback about these engagements that he has been having he said look the feedback is that we could be appointed, or we will be appointed, however the department at that point in time had not made provision budget-wise for these particular aspects.  He went onfurther to say they had impressed upon him to say that look we will start the process, okay, of making sure that the item is in the business plan, so you can start working on risk using your own files but bearing in mind that there is a possibility that the business plan might not be approved, and if you had gone ahead and rendered services and used your own funds, and the business plan is not approved don’t come back and say you are going to sue us, you are doing it on a risk basis, so if you spend money and we don’t succeed in getting the business planapproved that is your own baby, it is your own problem and you deal with it.That is my – that is exactly what the understanding was, and it so happened that when we started, actually started with the project, at that point in time, I think it was October, you know we can always check the dates, the business plan had not been approved, and I can demonstrate with evidential proof that we injected funds, I think it was about, just over R4million, into the project but we knew, and I knew specifically, I was – this was emphasized to me that if they come back and say look sorry guys we didn’t get the approval you would have lost your money and that was my understanding.     He is asking me long questions Chair, he expects me to give him short answers.      As long as it is any day except Monday to Friday Chair, that is fine. 
PEANE EDWIN SODI:  (d.s.s.) 
STENOGRAPHER:  [Indistinct]  
EXAMINATION BY ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Sodi, would you sit close to the microphone, please? 
SODI:But, you know, that’s my layman’s understanding that the actual binding document between us and the Department, which was very specific, in terms of how much was going to be paid, what services were expected to be performed, what sort of deliverables wereexpected by the client, you know, and how the payment was going to be structured, all those were contained in the IPW, that’s why I’m saying from my own layman’s understanding, the IPW would supersede SLA because it is very specific in terms of what ought to happen and how it’s suppose to happen but I certainly take Mr Pretorius’ point as well, I’m not saying that I’m…[intervenes].
