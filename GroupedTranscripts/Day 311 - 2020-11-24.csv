CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Mr Kennedy, good afternoon everybody.    Are we ready?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, no thank you Mr Burger and your attorney for making yourselves available at very short notice to assist the commission to make use of the time that it has.  Thank you.    Thank you.  Yes I think we will have to do the oath again.    Or affirmation.    Thank you Mr Burger; you may be seated.  So you confirm Mr Kennedy we will be using Denel Bundle 10 is that right?    Yes Exhibit W25.1.    Or – okay alright.    That is fine.    That is fine.    Yes.    Okay no that is alright.    I guess you would need to read it to see whether you remember having read it at some stage.    Yes.    Mr Kennedy you did not say minimum hey you said maximum?    You did not say minimum – it is written maximum but I heard you as if you were saying.    As if you were saying minimum.    Yes.    I recall this from the evidence that was given to me.    Just one second Mr Kennedy.  I wonder if they can reduce the air conditioner noise but if – ja I hoping that that will not be problematic in terms of heat.  But if it is too hot please somebody must tell me.  Mr Kennedy how is it like?    It is very hot.    Oh.  No, no, no.    No maybe if – maybe what you can do because it is not like I cannot hear – maybe what you can do is put your microphone I do not know where it can be closer because I was hearing you but I wanted to improve my hearing in terms of what you are saying. So I do not want everybody to complain about heat.    Maybe – maybe where I am it is not as hot as where you are.  Okay alright but I think if you do not speak too far from the phone – from the microphone.    It will help me.  Yes.    Yes, ja.  Okay alright.    Okay.    I – this is something you may have dealt with previously but I may have forgotten what you said.  What did you think then was the process that should have been followed if the open tender system should not be followed if you thought that was not the right process?      What is the process that you thought should be followed?    Yes Mr Kennedy.     Well, I think from what you have said.  One of the things you have said is that at the time you accepted that you were going to be acting in breach of this policy.       Is that correct?     But you considered – maybe I should not say this.  You must say it if that is the case.  What – did you consider that the breach was justified in any way, and if so, what is that you – that you thought justified the breach of the policy?     Did you think that the GCEO could give an instruction to anybody to actually act in breach of company policy?     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     But you would also accept, would you not, that it is people – it is particularly people as senior as you     Yes, yes.       And it was not done.     Ja.     Yes.     Certainly not by you.     Not by...     Ja.  Mr Kennedy.     [laughs]  It has to be correct Mr Burger.     The proposition has to be correct. [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     ...or the questions is    So Mr Kennedy is saying, you were part of the collective group that overruled her.  Do you agree?     It does not have to be – the word does not have to be used, overruled.       The fact of the matter is.  Two views were on the table.     Have you and in the view of the other view ...[intervenes]      ...and you said    Ja.     Ja.  H’m.     Yes.     H’m.     Hang on, Mr Burger.  If sympathising with her is important to mention you can deal with it later, I think Mr Kennedy’s question is not directed at sympathising or anything, I think what his question is directed at saying, knowing what you know now, one, that you were part of those who approved acting in breach of the policy despite her making it very clear to all of you that this would be in breach of policy and even quoting what the policy says and bearing in mind how you know she must have felt at the time when all of you in that meeting did not – or rejected what she told you and knowing she felt because you have seen how she was moved to tears when she was giving evidence before me when that issue arose again, are you able to say you feel that you should – or all of you should actually apologise to her for making her feel like this on something that at least now you see was quite clear or is that not the position?  I do not want you to say you apologise if that is not you feel.     Okay?  But what is quite clear and I think you acknowledge that at least as of now.  I will go back to the question of what your knowledge of the policy at the time because I wanted to go back to that but now you acknowledge the policy is quite clear.     The policy is quite clear.     And you were part of those who made a decision that was in breach of the policy despite that the fact that she brought the policy to your attention and we know how she felt about this because we saw how even years later when she was testifying how she was moved to tears when she was talking about this.   What do you say when you now look at the whole picture, about the fact that you were one of those who rejected what you now see was the right advice as to what should be done?     And bearing in mind that you were the CEO of the division.     Well, there was a way, Mr Burger.  One is, you read the policy or she told you – quoted the policy and you did not see anything in the policy that said that the Group CEO could override the Group Supply Chain Executive, is it not?     There was nothing like that.  And you were aware, were you not, that in terms of the policy, generally speaking will make rules and will also state where there are to be exceptions to the rules, were you not?     So, in other words, the policy tells you this is the general rule but in certain circumstances you can depart and it tells you if you have got to get approval from somebody else in order to depart from the general rule, is it not?  You knew that.     In terms of the policy.     And in taking the view that the Group CEO could instruct you to do something in breach of the policy, you did not check the policy whether it allows that, did you?     And that was no right, you should have checked, particularly because of you position as the CEO of the division.     Yes.     Yes, okay.  Mr Kennedy?     Just one last point in regard to that.  I said I was going to go back to the question of your knowledge of the policy because I had a little bit of some concern because last time you testified I think the idea that you did not have much knowledge of the policy seemed to loom large in your evidence.  Is my recollection correct?  To a very large extent you seem to be saying, you know, I am not a supply chain management policy person.     Yes, that is what I wanted to come to, that one of your duties must be to uphold the policy of the company.     And if you are serious about your duties as CEO you are going to make sure that each time you are going to make sure that you know the policy as much as possible and where you are not sure you will consult it and where you are not sure you could even ask for legal advice, is it not?     Mr Kennedy?     What page?     X24?     824, okay.     Okay, thank you.  Is that the – which bundle, the one we are using at the moment?     Okay, alright, 824.     Well, I am sorry, Mr Kennedy, before you proceed.  Mr Burger, you say that this reference to Regulation 16A 6.4 was not based on your knowledge, you spoke to somebody.     Head of the legal department.     Ja but I would have thought that if you – it was not based on your knowledge but based on what you had been advised by the head of legal your letter would be couched in those terms to say I have been informed or advised by the head of legal that actually it is Regulation blah, blah, blah, that does – you would not present it as your own knowledge because here it is presented as your own knowledge, would you not agree?     Yes.     Yes.  Okay, Mr Kennedy?     Well, you see, Mr Burger, there may be a concern here that maybe we are seeing what may have been a pattern.  Ms Malahlela raises concerns, valid concerns, and she have used her concerns that rejected on what we all now, including you, accept were not valid grounds. Mr Mlambo also raises concerns about procurement policy and there is a long letter from you written to you but in this long letter there isn’t a response on it, so one begins to say – excuse me – one begins to say how could it be that such legitimate concerns, when such legitimate concerns were raised by certain individuals who were very concerned about ensuring that the policy of the company was followed, how is it possible that each time you did not see their point of view.  How is it possible that you did not respond to the actual concern in the case of Mr Mlambo, one begins to ask that question.   Do you want to say something?     Yes.     So you – from what you are saying it seems you are saying to me maybe the reason why your letter didn’t address his stated concern was because you may have been trying to address not his stated concerns but what you believed was him being against VR Laser?     Ja, but not the point that he had raised because he didn’t raise the merits as it were, it was the process. MR BURGER;   Correct Chair.     And one would have expected that at a level at which all of you cooperated all of you would have known including yourself the difference between the process and the merits of a particular supplier, to say when the objection is to the process let’s address the process.   You can’t say let’s breach the process because the supplier is such a good supplier.  It doesn’t work like that, the process is there and you only depart from it if the policy allows you to depart from it?     Yes, Mr Kennedy?    Hang on Mr Kennedy I am sorry to interrupt you.  There is a question you formulated in a certain way earlier.  I am very interested in Mr Burger’s answer to that question.    What did you do in response to this – to – after you received Mr Mlambo’s response; what did you do?    You…    Obviously having read he – what he said at page 838 – 838 you realised that he was saying that the Treasury Regulation on which you relied was irrelevant.  You realise that that is what you are saying.    Yes.  And one would have expected that if you were genuinely engaging in a discussion to try and see exactly what the correct position is you would have wanted to look into that issue.  Why is he saying it is irrelevant when I believe it is relevant?  Is it not?   That would be the natural thing if you were really interested in establishing is his point of view the correct one or is it my point of view that is correct?  He has now said something that I was relying on is irrelevant.  You would want to look into that, is it not?    You did not ja.    But you accept that that is one – that is what one would have expected    From you if – and it did not happen?    Why did it not happen because this was – if his – if his point that that regulation was irrelevant was valid it could have made a big difference in the view you took could it not?    Yes.    Yes.  But why did you not pursue that and even go and look at the regulation yourself or go back to the head of the legal department and say, Mr Mlambo and expert in Supply Chain Management says this regulation you told me about is irrelevant what do you say?  Because if he is right this might change my whole view.  Why did you not go to the head of the legal department and say that?    Yes you see precisely because you acknowledge that he was very knowledgeable on these matters.  It is precisely because of that that one is surprised.    Why you did not say look this person who is very knowledgeable in these matters is saying this regulation is irrelevant I must therefore take his view very seriously because he may be right or he is probably right.  And – so I am concerned as to why despite you knowing that this is somebody who is knowledgeable in these matters and he could go back to your evidence that you did not know much maybe about these matters all the more reason why you would be expected to take his view very seriously before there is – was any finality and if necessary get some advice from other knowledgeable people.  But at least go back to the head of the legal department and say, hang on here is Supply Chain Management Guru here says this is irrelevant we cannot take us views lightly.  Tell me why he is wrong?  You understand that?    Yes.  Because now I would expect that you would agree now that when you look at that regulation as he has quoted it he was right, was he not?    Yes.  Mr Kennedy.    I know I interrupted you but I thought you had asked an important question that needed to be answered.    I am sorry.    I may – I might not have heard you correctly Mr Burger but I thought when you made the comment about being strangled I think that is the term you used by the PFMA.  I thought you said we sometimes felt that – I do not know whether you said we strangle ourselves or we were strangled by adhering to the PFMA.  Did I …    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes. MR    Yes.    But I am – the reason why I am raising is that Mr Kennedy subsequently asked you whether that is what you had said and he seems to have heard it in the same way as I think I did namely that when you made that remark you were saying you thought by which I understood you in the company thought sometimes I do not know whether you said strangled yourselves or the...    Or the PFMA has strangled you.    But later on you said it was an opinion held by some people I do not know whether you said in the legal department.    But – and you said it was not an opinion of – held by you.    So that is why I am going back.    To say I thought I heard you to be including yourself as one of the people who felt that sometimes the PFMA strangled you or you were strangled by the PFMA.  So I am checking whether I did not hear you correctly to be saying we.    As opposed to other people.    Yes.  Yes.  But I must put this to you that it seems as I understand your evidence that with regard to whether you were one of those who held that opinion about being strangled or strangling yourself it seems that when you made the remark you may have included yourself.   But later on when you were answering a question that Mr Kennedy put to you, you seem to have said that was not your opinion it was the opinion of others.    Hang on – hang on let me finish – let me finish.  But when you are answering me now I understand you to be – to include yourself?    Now I am not sure I just want to make sure that I have understood you correct but this is how I have understood you.    The – your answer to Mr Kennedy?    You were not including yourself?  You did not hold that opinion that sometimes you strangle yourself – you strangled yourselves.    Trying to comply with the PFMA that is not an opinion that you held at the time, is that what you are saying?    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.  But – but did I understand your evidence correctly that when you were answering Mr Kennedy you had said it was not your opinion that is what I want to check?  What – had you – did you say that to Mr Kennedy?   Hm. Well there may be some inconsistency but Mr Kennedy you – you …    Ja.    Well Mr Kennedy we are at half past four and I have certainly from my side we can continue but we – maybe we need to agree.    At what stage we might take a short break and maybe we could take it now or maybe we can still go on until five and take it from there also depending on the witness he might need a break.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  No …    Okay so maybe if we are – if you think we might be finished by five o’clock then maybe unless the witness or his attorney needs a break maybe we can just go on.  Mr Burger you do not particularly need a break now?    Oh you are fine.    Are you fine?      Okay alright then let us proceed then.    Yes.    Okay alright.    Okay alright.    We are now back in Bundle 10?    Yes.  And it is page 7?    720.       Mr Motsepe.  Mr Motsepe.  Is it not Motsepe?       Ja.     Why did you say that at Denel there was a separate department or you unit that looks after the image of the company?     What was that to say, it was something that none of you should concern yourselves within the context of the contracts?     Yes, but what I mean is.  Am I correct in understanding you to have taken the view that the discussions or engagements that you were having with them, should not bring in issues of the image of the company because there were other people whose job was to concern themselves about that.  Is that what you meant?     So was your attitude that it did not matter how much, having the contract with a particular entity who could potentially tarnish the image of the Denel, it was fine for all of you to approve that contract being entered into with such an entity because the Group CEO said do not concern yourselves about the issues of the image of the company?     I would have expected to you have been.     Well, I am not sure if it is in 2020 Mr Burger because this was 2016.     Three years after the landing of the Gupta aeroplane at Waterkloof.       The Gupta jet landing at Waterkloof happened in 2013 around April.  So this was April 2016.  This was three years later.     And my recollection and the evidence that has been led before the Commission in regard to that landing, has been that the whole country was shocked that a private jet or an aeroplane hired by or owned by just some private people, foreigners or citizens or whatever they were, could be allowed to land at Waterkloof.  And there was a big issue in the whole country. And for some people who might not have taken notice of the Gupta’s or the influence that they appear to have within government, that was the moment that made them sit back     Or you accept that there was some negativity.  It is a question of how much there was, how much negativity there was.     By 2016.  Actually, I see that you say in     So by then you must – there must have been in your own view quite some negative media attention surrounding the Gupta’s.     Yes.     Now, I would then have thought that it would have been a matter of concern to you and either senior people at Denel or DLS to conclude a contract with an entity that was connected with people who enjoy that negativity about them. Because if Denel concludes a contract with them, Denel’s own image and reputation may be severely damaged.  They may be seen as friends to these people. And why would that not be something that you would     So what I am putting to you is that.  I would have expected this to have been a matter of serious concern to any senior person within a company, particularly at your level. And especially when it was being pointed out by other people within the company.  Because you do say that some of the people were concerned.  One of them Mr Mlambo, I think you said. Even though, in regard to this point, he might not have raised that but you say there were other discussions from which you knew, as far as you are concerned, that he was concerned about that.     Well, you may have looked away and you may have decided at some stage that you did not want to take political sides, but there is always what is right and there is always what is wrong.     And leaving aside political sides within the context of the Gupta’s, the negative press that you talk about here, was the press that was saying they were involved in acts of corruption.   It was the press that was making all kinds of allegations.  And I accept that it was allegations at that stage.  We will see by the end of the work of the Commission where we are with that particular allegations that they were involved in corruption. And I would have thought that when it came to allegations such as that, you would be concerned to say, it is not a question of taking political sides.   It is a question that I do not want Denel to be associated with an entity against whom there are all kinds of allegations of corruption.  You understand?     Yes, okay.     Ja, ja.  Mr Kennedy.     Yes.  Ja.     Ja.     Yes.       Okay.     That is fine.  Let us take a ten minutes’ break.     So coming back at about...  Well, let us just make it – we will resume at ten past five.       That will give you enough time with your team.     Okay we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Yes, Mr Kennedy?     Well, let us understand that clearly, Mr Burger.  You would be able to make a distinction between what he said and what you understood him to be saying, hopefully the two will be in harmony, but they might not be in harmony.  The political pressure that you say he generally spoke about that he was under…     What was your understanding of what he was being politically pressurised to do?     That is what I want to hear, what are those things?     As you understood them.     Do you recall any people that he thought should be treated in a special way when they visited the company?  By any chance to you remember any names or you never got the names?     Ja, individuals.     No.  But did he mention or you have forgotten or he never mentioned?     Yes, okay.     Yes, okay.  Okay and in terms of companies that he thought should be …[intervenes]     Okay, that is fine.     No, no, that is fine.     Okay.  Well, if you do remember later on you can give us a supplementary affidavit.     Mr Kennedy?     Did you say 824?     Thank you.  Mr Burger, the answer that you have given with regard – when you said you do not know where …[intervenes]     The answer that you gave to Mr Kennedy just now which involved you saying you could not get a quote within a day.  Remember that answer?     Was that in relation to page 825 where Mr Mlambo made the handwritten note saying DVS and MLT (sic) must submit proof that they cannot meet the requirements prior to the contract being awarded to VR Laser or that is in response to something else?     Or you are not sure? MR     Ja.  In terms of what were you – was that in the context of that because that question arose because, as I understood the position, it was said that there was urgency.     That is why he – what he required could not be given.  Is that what you were talking about because I am not sure that that required quotes if it was in the context of this handwritten note.  All he wanted was proof that they cannot meet the requirements, they cannot do the job, I guess is what he meant, as I understand it.     Yes.     How long do you think it would have taken from your understanding of ...[intervenes]      A week, two days?     But a week wouldn’t have made any – a week’s delay wouldn’t have made a big difference as I understand the position.  As I understand the position in the scheme of that contract it would – a day or a week wouldn’t have made a big difference as I understand the position there.     Yes.       Ja.     Yes, yes, Mr Kennedy you must help me, I may have been misunderstanding at least you and I have been there with all the witnesses.     Was your question in the context of this note?     Because now I don’t know whether it was Mr Burger or another previous witness, my impression was that really it wouldn’t have made much difference if there was a delay of a few days.     Yes, but now Mr Burger is talking about guns and so on, does that relate to guns?     But I mean I would have thought that Mr Ntshepe would have known if there were good reasons for urgency?     Ja, he discounted that.  Did you know, Mr Burger even with the -  within the context of guns that you are talking about, the testing of guns or whatever, do you know what the deadline was as at the time of this memo, namely 29 October 2015?  Because if you don’t know the deadline you – if you don’t know the deadline you might not be able to say that the deadline would not have been matched if there was a delay of a week, but if you know that the deadline was within the three days after this then you would know that you couldn’t afford that deadline but do you know what the deadline was?     But the long and short of your evidence in this regard is – I must just check with you – that you know that there were some time pressures.     But you don’t know whether those time pressures were such that a delay of a week would have made a difference or not, that you don’t know, or do you?     Yes, yes.     Okay no that’s fine.     Mr Crous do you still want to – would you like to re-examine?     You have no re-examination.     Okay thank you very much.  Thank you very much Mr Burger for coming to give evidence, if we need you to come back we will ask you and I am sure you will come back, but thank you very much for availing yourself and you are now excused.     Thank you.        Yes, okay no that is fine.  We are going to adjourn for the day and tomorrow I will be hearing – this is for the benefit of the public, I will be hearing evidence relating to OEH, the OEH Company, that evidence started yesterday, it will continue tomorrow and for the rest of the week. We adjourn. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Good afternoon Chair.    We are thank you Chair and thank you for accommodating further evidence of the Denel witness from whom you have heard.    Parts a week or so ago Mr Burger.    May I thank Mr Burger and his attorney Mr Crouse for accommodating us.    At short notice this morning.    Thank you Chair.    That is correct and it is Exhibit W25 in Bundle 10.    That is correct.    Chair we will in fact be referring to some other exhibits as well for purposes of cross-reference.    Particularly …    Annexures to the affidavits of Ms Malahlela.    And Mr Mlambo.    Mr Burger you will recall on the last occasion that we dealt at length with the award of the Hulls contract – the Platform Hulls Contract by DLS to VR Laser, do you recall that?    And then we just started with certain aspects relating to the next award to VR Laser by DLS while you were the DLS CEO and that was the Sole Supplier Contract or the Single Supplier Contract for various…    That was for various steel fabricated parts, correct?    Right.  And we dealt mainly with these topics Mr Saloojee giving you the instruction and of course his version is that the initiative came from you but we have covered your evidence on that.  Why you accepted the instruction and you made the acknowledgement to your credit that in retrospect you realised that the correct procedures were not necessarily followed in the award of that contract.    Right.  Now I just want to go into some of the background that led up to the actual finalisation of the – of the contract.  May I ask you to look at Bundle 1 – Denel Bundle 1?  You have listened to the evidence have you not of Ms Malahlela and you have also been provided with a copy of her affidavit for your comment, correct?    And you are aware that at an early stage according to Ms Malahlela’s evidence she raised a serious concern about the award of the Single Supplier Contract to VR Laser particularly because there was no tender or RFQ -  Competitive Procurement Process?    And were you not aware of that at the time?    So you found that out only 2016?  You sure you were not aware of that in 2015 at all?    Then how – then how do you come to say that you only found out about it in 2016 if you say you cannot recall if you found out about it during 2015?    So you can?    Well can I take you in Bundle 1 to page 659?  Now this is an email from Ms Malahlela dated the 23 March 2015 so it is early in 2015 addressed exclusively to Mr Teubes.  It is not copied into you.  Can you recall if you saw this email?    Right.  Is it possible you may have?    Okay.    Yes perhaps I can just read the relevant parts to the witness Chair?    This is what Ms Malahlela said to Mr Teubes. “Hi Reenen, I have given – gone through the document and I realise that you have taken out my recommendation and now the document has the name of the supplier specified.  I do not mean to belabour the point but I am still of the opinion that should management approve this request DLS must go out on tender or RFQ for the appointment of a single source for this scope of work. Once we have identified the supplier that meets DLS’s requirements through a competitive process then we can appoint such a supplier for a minimum of three years as a single source specification and evaluation criteria must be sent to all suppliers listed before time etcetera.” Now Ms Malahlela gave evidence …    I am sorry?    Oh I am sorry – did I say?    I am sorry did I misread it?  I apologise.    From maximum of three years as single source.  Thank you Chair.    And the context she gave to this in her affidavit and in her oral evidence was this.  She had initially prepared a motivation recommendation and unfortunately it is referred to in her affidavit but not attached – just the recovering email and it appears that the memorandum itself has gone astray.  But there is no dispute between here and Teubes that she initially when she put out the recommendation as the head of Supply Chain at DLS said this needs to go out to tender.  And here she is replying to Mr Teubes.  Because if we look on the next page – page 660 in the middle of the page – in fact the foot of the page the bottom email is from her dated the 12 March 2015. “Please find the attached document as requested.” And her evidence has been that was the – that was the recommendation in which she had recommended that it this is to go out on a Single Source Supplier Contract there would have to be a competitive process.  And he then replies the middle of page 660 on the 20 March and he    Yes but my question earlier was whether you saw this email and you have already answered that before.    My question now is did he discuss it with you – Mr Teubes whether by email or person to person or however?    Yes I think we understand what a RFQ process involved we have been through this a number of times before.    My interest is really in the – in – on the question of accountability and who discussed what with whom and who gave approval, and who was taking the initiative?  For example you have said in your affidavit repeatedly and adamantly Mr Saloojee was pressuring you to award the contract – this contract to VR Laser.  He says no he was not pressuring you – you were pressuring him and your colleagues.  And that – I believe that it may be of interest to the learned Commissioner in the commission to know where the buck stopped?  Because you as CEO have already said in great detail on the previous occasion that there was huge good reason why DLS should give a Single Supplier Contract to VR Laser and nobody else.  You recall that?    Which seems to perhaps make sense if you were the one who was driving the process and – and I think it would be fair for the commission to understand whether you were aware of this at the time or not.  So with respect to you Mr Burger may I suggest you do not dwell on what is involved in a RFQ process?  We know that Ms Malahlela was saying you should go out on a tender or RFQ process.  We know what those processes involve and we know why they are there to try and ensure a measure of competitiveness and that is why she was promoting the idea.  But it was not being picked up by management of which you formed part.  If you cannot remember whether this was discussed with you by Mr Teubes or Ms Malahlela at the time you must say that.    And then the last paragraph.    It is very hot.    I am finding that – but quite honestly Chair…    It is very important you hear the evidence.    Thank you Chair.    Yes I have moved it Chair.    Thank you.    I hope it is better.    Mr Burger can I take you to the last paragraph of this email?   “I do not think we should piggy-back on the process that was followed for the Platform Hull.  We should go out on a separate RFQ tender process where we invite all suppliers that we think are capable and then do such appointment.  We will ask Michelle to schedule a meeting.” So she specifically saying it does not help that we went on a RFQ process for the Platform Hulls Contract and we have dealt with this in your evidence before.     That involved three bids that was the RFQ process which was to an extent a competitive process.    So she is saying but we cannot just piggy-back on that because that process was for that contract – for those items – Platform Hulls.  And as you confirmed in your evidence last time this was for a different type of component.  You cannot say well because I have awarded you Contract A therefore you entitled to Contract B. That was her rationale.  Now does that not make sense to you now?    Yes.  And in fact in the previous paragraph I am not going to read it into the record she in    Thank you Chair.  So we have just seen the email from Ms Malahlela to Mr Teubes and that was in March 2015.  Now we know and you have agreed in your affidavit as I understand it that the MOA was signed in May 2015.     You recall that/    I would like you now in the same bundle to please turn to page 672.  Do you have it?    Now this is an EXCO committee meeting minute of the 29 October 2015.  Unfortunately it does not as one normally would expect state who was present and who may have been absent or who chaired it.  May I just refresh your memory as to what it says.  Paragraph 1.1. “A concern was noted with regard to placement of orders on VR Laser.  The predicament here is that the GSCE approval – sorry approved this deviation from the procurement process on the following condition.  “Under no circumstances shall products or services that can be procured from a group entity or division be procured from an external supplier to a non-Denel company unless there is approval by the Group Supply Chain Executive based on sound business reasons.”  This is also in line with the Group Supply Chain Policy and the DLS Supply Chain Procedure.  The above provisions are in direct conflict with the MOU that DLS signed with VR Laser where VR Laser is the sole supplier for all complex welding and machining work to DLS for the next ten years.” And there was a resolution. “The committee took a decision that the MOU takes precedence over the GSCE’s condition and the Group Supply Chain Policy and the DLS Supply Chain Procedure.  The committee stated also that given the – it says resend history – presumably it should be recent history with regard to prize – it should be presumably price and turnaround time VR was the preferred supplier with all opportunities.  It was further stated that in terms of the MOU VR Laser prices must be market related and in line with the Provisions of the MOA before an order can be placed on them. Due to this reason and previous experience with VR Laser committee felt confident that the VR Laser prices will be market related and reasonable.  Celia Malahlela was tasked to draft a letter to the GSCE and explain the decision taken in this regard.” Now Mr Burger do you recall being at this meeting where this was discussed and this was decided?    And the concern – the predicament that was raised in the first bullet point and the heading 1.1 a concern was noted.  That was concern – that concern or concern about the predicament was raised by Ms Malahlela herself, not so?    Yes.  And this clearly is that we have not complied with the Group Supply Chain Management Policy because the GCSE or the GSCE rather Mr Mlambo had not approved the transaction relating to whether an outside supplier rather than an internal supplier could be used.  Correct?  That was the concern she raised.    Right.  Now this was raised in October 2015.    Formerly in a meeting and it is minuted.  So your evidence cannot be correct earlier which suggested although you seemed to go back on that later that you only heard about it in passing from Ms Malahlela only in 2016.  It cannot be correct can it?    Yes.    Yes and presumably this is the EXCO meeting.    Right.  Now if I can take you back for a moment in the same bundle to page 669?  But let us start at 662.  This is the Denel SOC Limited Procurement Policy Group Supply Chain Policy.  Correct?    And that became effective as it is indicated near the top right on page 662 on the 19 November 2014.    Now if we look at page 669 Clause 6.10.1 under the heading Intergroup and Group    Of that EXCO meeting that you attended.    Ms Malahlela was specifically quoting and recording a provision of the Group Supply Chain Management Policy that she contended had been breached, correct?    Right.  Now is it correct that you had a discussion about this and you discussed it in these terms. Which one takes precedence?  Does the MOA/MOU take precedence over the Group Supply Chain Policy the policy take precedence over the MOU/MOA?  Is that the frame of reference of the discussion?    But what did you understand Mr Burger to be the status of the Group Supply Chain Management Policy?  Can I just suggest something that I would with great respect suggest must be very obviously particularly to somebody so experienced in business and that is you have a policy which lays down rules for the Denel group which you must comply with when procuring goods or services, correct?    And you do so through contracts, correct?    So when you procure through a contract you must comply with the rules that are set out in the Supply Chain Management Policy, correct?    So could you explain to us please how on earth you came to decide in this meeting that the agreement takes precedence over the policy?  Surely it is the other way around?     Yes, we will get to that memorandum in a moment.  What I want to put to you Mr Burger is that, the mere fact that a contract has been entered into in violation of a policy does not mean that there are no implications.       Thank you, Chair.  If the policy was not a law that you did not have to comply with – and if you entered into a contract that was contrary to that policy, well then the contract must just fore stand.  What is the point of having a policy at all?   Oh, because it would mean that people could, as actually happened here, go into a – signing an agreement with full knowledge thanks to Ms Malahlela that there was there a breach.  She first raised the issue of noting your RFP process.  That was rejected by Mr Teubes.   And secondly, she raised the point that you have not got GC / GSCE approval to go outside the divisions.  But if you could – if you felt that well that does not matter because it is not the law, it is only a policy.   What is the purpose of having a policy if you are not going to comply with it?     And in fact, the policy – you talk about exceptions.  The policy specifically says that where you wanting to procure something that could be purchase to procure in-house, you want to go outside to an external supplier.  You have to get – there have to two things satisfied. The one is, you have to get the approval of the Group Supply Chain Executive, not from the Divisional CEO, namely Mr Burger, or his deputy or his assistant, Mr Teubes.   Only the GSCE could give that approval.  Do you agree with me?     Well, in fact, that approval at a higher level than Mr Mlambo had, took place long after this.  It did not happen at this time.     May I suggest we focus on the topic of my question?     Do you accept that?     Is that fair to say?     Let us try to confine ourselves to that.  You were the CEO.  You were there to ensure that there was proper compliance with whatever was required.  And here we     And then a further problem is raised by Ms Malahlela a few months later.  There is another reason why we have a respect in which we have not complied with the policy and that is, we never go the GSCE approval.   Now it just seems to me that the policy does not really have any sense or usefulness if twice in a row its provisions     Did you not ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Well, let us accept all that evidence Mr Burger.  But may I go back to the question?  You     Sorry, the principle?     Will you not just answer the question?  Was she for or against this resolution?     Against it?     So was a minority.  Was she joined by you Mr Burger?  Did you take her side or were you against her side?     I am asking what you did Mr Burger.  Let us not hear about how you allow other people to express ...[intervenes]      And you supported it?     Right.  So you were part of a collective that overruled Ms Malahlela.  Is that a formulation that you are more comfortable with?     Or is it wrong?     Right.  So, did you – to go back to your point earlier that you know had a contract, whether you liked it or not, you did have a contract with an outside supplier and you felt that the policy was really just an internal matter that should not affect your relationship with the outside supplier.       Why not Mr Burger?     So you were aware at that stage that there was media controversy and public controversy about Denel’s involvement with Gupta associates and businesses, correct?     Yes.  Now you say that you thought that featured more in Ms Malahlela’s approach.  What are you suggesting?  That she was trying to use wrongly Supply Chain Management Rules to try and get the company to stop doing business with the Gupta’s or what?  What are you suggesting?     She was correct, not so?     And in fact, she was also correct that the Supply Chain Management Policy was breached.  You have already acknowledged that, to your credit.     Did you see Ms Malahlela when she ended her evidence in tears here?     A long time after she left Denel, she is still moved to tears and gave evidence that she tried her best as the citizen of this country and as an honest, loyal servant of...  Sorry, that is a bad terminology from the old days.   A loyal employee of a state-owned corporation where she tried repeatedly to get her bosses, including you, to comply with the policy and you would not.   And she did it in the context of where there was indeed growing controversy about Denel’s links with the very controversial Gupta family and their associates.       And despite knowing that she had views as a professional that was not acting in bad faith, not so?  You already conceded that.     Yes.  So she is saying to you    Perhaps as a human being Mr Burger, what you feel.  May I remind you – I have taken you through this already.  Your 138-page affidavit, I think it is, spends probably, at least half of that, saying how innocent you are and how this has been such a terrible thing for you personally to have to go through the glare of the nation and the glare of the media, associating you with the Gupta’s and associating you with allegations of corruption and so forth. I have never received a penny from the Gupta’s or anybody else.  You protest your innocence repeatedly but what you do not have there is an acknowledgement, that you     But not followed.     But not followed.     No.     Yes.     Do you feel any regret?  Just at a level of a human being as to effectively her career was wrecked at Denel.  It is effectively what she was saying to the Chairman last time.  Took some months to try and manoeuvre her financial situation so that she could be at a point that she could actually leave, totally demoralised and heartbroken, effectively.       And again you say    Was it really similar, Mr Burger?     Was it really similar?  You breached the procurement policy in important respects despite the fact that she was telling you do not breach the procurement policy?  Is that truly similar?  Who was right and who was wrong?     Yes.     So are you playing the victim then, you say well, poor her because poor me.  That is effectively what you seem to be saying.     Thank you, Chair.  May I take …[intervenes]     And none of this was done.     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, may I now ask the witness to turn to page 824?      824.     824.     824, correct.     Yes, the same bundle 1.     Now this is a memorandum that was sent by Ms Malahlela to Mr Dennis Mlambo, the supply chain executive at Denel head office level, dated the 29 October 2015, correct?     And that was sent on the instructions of Exco.     Following on the meeting held just before this memo was sent.     The one we just looked at the minutes, correct?     Yes.  And you will have heard from Ms Malahlela’s evidence that she complied with the instruction although with some misgivings and she said at     Right.     Now of course we have seen in this memorandum that has been dealt with at some length by Ms Malahlela  and Mr Mlambo that she has referred to the previous indication by the Group Supply Chain Executive that products such as these should be sourced in-house unless there was a good reason to depart from this.  And then in the second paragraph she actually quotes the Group Supply Chain policy, the very same quotation that she had given in the earlier document that we have looked at that it has to be approved by the GCSE if you are going outside the group and he or she as the GCSE can only give such a decision based on sound business reasons.     So she was alerting him to that and then she says in the third paragraph on page 824 that DLS in fact had already signed.  This is in May, so that was five months earlier, DLS had signed an MOA with VR Laser for the scope of work.  It then refers to the BBBEE credentials and it refers also to provisions of the MOA relating to prices being market-related, etcetera.  And then she says,     “…supply chain approached DLS Exco  to make a decision as to whether to honour the MOA and placed the order on VR Laser or to follow the supply chain policy and procure from inter-group namely DVS or LMT for this project.  Given the timeframe, urgency and history, Exco has recommended that the work be done by VR Laser.” And then she concludes with the passage I have already read.  And of course we know that Mr Mlambo refused to give the approval that she was requesting here on behalf of Exco and we see his handwritten note under the blank area where it says approval, he refused to sign it and then     Now that was sometime later.  What happened before Mr Ntshepe signed, as we see here, to say he has approved, in other words he has approved the stance of your Exco that you must honour the MOA with VR Laser.  Something else happened and that was you attempted to persuade Mr Mlambo to give his approval, is that right?     Well, I do not want to invent anything.  To be fair to you, let me take you to page 837.  If you cannot recall, this may jog your memory.  837, it is just a few pages further on.  Now that is a letter from you on the Denel Land Systems letterhead and we see in very small print the date is the 29 April 2016  Do you see that?     And that is in fact a letter that came from you.  Is that you name and signature on page 838?  Correct.     Now this is what you say in your     “I confirm my discussion that a single  source supplier agreement hereinafter referred to as the MOA was entered into with VR Laser on 19 May 2015 pursuant to a motivation being submitted to DCO.  The motivation was recommended for approval by both the Group Executive Business Development Mr Zwelakhe Ntshepe and the Group Chief Operations Officer, Mr Johan Wessels, whereupon it was approved by the Group CEO at the time, namely Mr Riaz Saloojee.  The approval by the Group CEO of VR Laser as a single source supplier is in accordance with regulation 16A 6.4 of the National Treasury Regulations 2005.  Copy of the approval dated 22 April 2015, the signed MOA and the applicable National Treasury Regulation is attached marked A, B and C respectively.” Now you have indicated that around this time you were not fully knowledgeable about the law relating to public procurement and what exactly applied, whether this was lawful and so forth.  May I suggest to you that you seem now to have acquired some knowledge because you are here referring to – whether your reference is correct or not is something Mr Mlambo deals with later but you certainly here seem to know quite a bit about the National Treasury Regulations, you are in fact quoting the specific clause of the Regulation 16A 6.4 of the 2005 regulation and you then attach it.  May I ask you where you got that knowledge from, have you had that all along or – I see you are smiling?  Had somebody enlightened you, is that you asked for somebody to assist you on this?     Ms Govender?     To assist you on that.     Yes.  And let us just get the context of this.  We know that Mr Mlambo had been sent for his approval the recommendation we looked at a moment ago saying that will you what has been done.  Can you recall if he had rejected his approval at the stage you had the meeting with him and then your letter?  Was he still deciding it or was it after he had put in this handwritten portion on page 825?     Yes.     Yes.     On your part or on his part or both?     Both, yes.     You knew there was a problem, not so?     Yes.  Okay, let us see what else you say in your motivation for him to give approval.     Thank you, Chair.  And you did not refer in your letter to the fact that Ms Malahlela had already raised concerns about noncompliance with the policy, not so?     On the contrary you were saying this can be done in terms of the National Treasury Regulations.     I see.   Well, let us carry on at the foot of page 837 with what you said to Mr Mlambo.   “As indicated during the meeting and in terms of the abovementioned approval…” Presumably the GCEO’s approval that had already taken place, is that right?     I am looking at the letter at page 837.     And I am looking at your last     Yes.  And then you carry on    Yes.  But Mr Mlambo’s concern was not so much as to whether VR Laser was good at its job, Mr Mlambo’s concern was the supply chain management policy says that before we go outside the group there has to be a good business reason why we go outside the group, not is the outside supplier a good supplier, but why can we not use our in-house suppliers?  Now presumably, if he had been presented with reasons that the in-house entity such as LMT and DVS did not have the capacity, that would have constituted a sound business reason but none of the reason you are putting forward here had anything to do with that, not so?  You just simply say VR Laser are great, correct?    Yes.  And then you conclude your     Can you explain why you made no attempt to actually address the real problem which is why you could not source them from LMT or DVS, I am not asking why you could not source from those, I am asking you why you did not even raise that point in your letter because that was the point of concern to him, not so?     Well, that you did say in the letter.     That is his only thrust of his concern, was you have not complied with the supply chain management policy.  If you want to comply you must ask me, the Group Supply Chain Executive, for approval as to why we should not give the contract to an in-house entity which at that stage was LMT and DVS, correct?     And to do that you have to satisfy me, as GSCE, that there are good business reasons for sending it outside the company.  So all you have given him is well, we have done an agreement with them, seemingly suggesting well, if we have done an agreement and it is in breach of the policy well, tough.  And secondly, well, VR Laser are great guys. With respect, it does not actually address at all Mr Mlambo’s concern which seems to be to be a valid concern.     You did not go through any of the argument that Mr Mlambo had invited you to give, why should you go outside the group entities?  Why should go outside?  You did not address that at all.     Thank you Chair.  I want to pick up with something you said a little earlier and that is that you were aware of the sensitivity arising from the media controversy concerning Denel’s doing business with VR Laser and their links with the Guptas.  Now if it is true what you have said in your affidavit repeatedly that you were aware that the Guptas were linked with this, you were aware that there was this controversy but to link you with any wrongdoing is just completely inappropriate, because you were simply trying to do your job, objectively and honestly in the interest of Denel. Surely it would have made sense for you, especially when Ms Malahlela and then at Group Level Mr Mlambo had both raised repeatedly real concerns about non-compliance with procurement procedures, it would have been at least expedient and sensible for you to say I think I need to protect myself to make absolutely sure because this is something that could well backfire.  The spotlight of the media and the public and possibly courts, and possibly commissions in the future may be looking at all of this because there is so much controversy, I better make sure that I am squeaky clean on this, and yet you go against the guidance, the very strong advice of the two experts, the one in your division who was part of your own personnel as well as above you at Head Office, and you seem to have just thought well I can ignore what they say, isn’t that really what you were doing?     Exactly.     I am sorry I am not sure if I understand your earlier evidence.  You raised the concern about the media controversy in the context of the earlier memorandum from Ms Malahlela that we looked at some time back, not this correspondence between you and Mr Mlambo’s latest April 2016, you in fact gave evidence that you believe it was in the latter part of 2015 that media controversy was becoming so intense and that was in the context of her motivation dated the 29 t h of October 2015.   Do you remember your evidence that was that ...[intervenes]      The point remains though whether it was intense or pale, whether it was light or heavy intensity you were aware at this time that the media were scrutinising in the public domain with some measure of real interest, in fact you suggested that they went really overboard with exaggerating and distorting the facts and so forth.  Surely your – alarm bells should have been ringing, I being the CEO of a State Owned Corporation must make sure that my operations are squeaky clean in complying with legal requirements, and here you are twice told by supply chain officials, Ms Malehlela and Mr Mlambo you cannot do this and you have been telling the Chairperson as I understand it well you thought you could do it, they were telling you, you can’t do that and still you went on ahead and now you acknowledge to the Chairperson with the benefit of hindsight you know what they were right all along.  It is just a mystifying, can you perhaps explain?       I would like to pick up on one point that made you, that higher authority approved it, and it is so that Mr Saloojee signed it but the Chairperson has all the evidence before him as to which version applies to which witness, but of course Mr Saloojee’s attitude has been well I wasn’t alerted by Mr Burger about issues relating to non-compliance with these supply chain management policy, so I assumed that he was doing the right thing.  He was the one who was pushing me resolutely to expedite the approval and signature of this process. You on the other hand say well I thought that although I knew Malahlela and Mlambo were against this on the basis that there breaches of the supply chain management policy I in my wisdom thought no they are actually wrong and well it should be fine because the Group CEO has been persuaded to sign so obviously he must be happy.   It just seems it is sort of passing the buck back and forth isn’t it Mr Burger?     Do you at least accept this Mr Burger, again with the benefit of hindsight, which as they say always gives you 20/20 vision, that it is not particularly surprising that where you went into a contract, one of three contracts within the Denel Group, two of which you were actively involved in, you went in knowing that you were doing business with VR Laser, that has had good track record and its previous owners had recently been acquired by Gupta Associates, it was part of the Gupta Group, where you knew that there was press, media controversy and so forth, and where there had been questions raised subsequently as to compliance with the correct processes.   Now isn’t it something to be expected by you as a CEO looking not only to making the best business decision but one which as part of being the best business decision should take into account in its protection reputation, avoid reputational damage and the Commission has heard considerable evidence from various witnesses as to the terrible damage that has been done on – to Denel and its ability to trade, trade successfully, exploited opportunities that are otherwise available to it.  There has been devastating impact on Denel’s image and that largely arises – so the evidence has been, and your own evidence seems to be to this extent as well that there has been huge controversy in the media and in the public domain about the links between Denel and VR Laser and its links with the Guptas.  It just seems in retrospect perhaps you can accept that it makes sense the people are wondering how did you give a contract like this to VR Laser in the first place, and how did – why did it happen that this was done by our own admission now in breach of procurement policies by your own admission now in the face of specific advice to the contrary given by your colleagues Malahlela and Mlambo and do you accept that it – there is some sense to the fact that people are raising the sort of questions that I am asking you here, because if it was just so genuine and bona fide as your affidavit has repeatedly tried to make out how could it come about that at least two contracts involving you were given to VR Laser Services where by your own admission there had been breaches of policies, and you expect the Chairperson and the nation to believe well that has nothing to do with the fact, it is a pure coincidence that this happens to have involved Gupta associates who have been involved according to other evidence in numerous other acts of corrupt and illegal activities.     If your opinion was that neither LNT nor DVS had the capacity and reliability to be able to produce these items why didn’t you bother to say that to Mr Mlambo because that is exactly what he was asking for, he was saying give me a good business reason why we can’t keep this work in-house.     Let’s look at Mr Mlambo’s response on page 838.     838.  He says this is again his handwritten response instead of signing where it says approval he instead leaves that blank and simply writes in     Right and he is saying still this is now almost a year later, almost to the day a year later, 29 t h of April 2016, the MOA was signed I believe it was on the     And then paragraph 3 says    Regulation 16 [a] 6.4.  Now as it happens, can I ask you to turn to page 719, as it happens Mr Mlambo, same bundle, has for the convenience of all of us in his affidavit quoted the treasury regulation.  719,     And you accept that that was part of his duties to highlight if there were any breaches of the procurement policy?     Yes, now what did you do in response to his response that we have just seen?     He does not actually say that expressly in his words.  Did he say that in the meeting?    It is not a bit unfair on Mr Mlambo and a copout on your part Mr Burger?  Why point a finger of blame at Mr Mlambo?  Mr Mlambo was also emotional; he was not brought to tears but you could see he was very emotional in his evidence too.   And he gave evidence that he acted in a particular way as he did and ultimately he too was demoralised to the extent that he then gave up an otherwise very impressive career at Denel.  Why criticise him?  My questions are directed at you.  You are sitting in this witness box.  Now you say there was a difference of opinion.    Yes.  Now let us assume for a moment that both of you were acting completely in good faith.  You were both acting honourably and you both had a genuine belief in your respective opinions.  My question was that elicited your last answer where you pointed finger of blame at him was why did you not respond Mr Mlambo’s response to you?  So let us look at this difference of opinion.  For example the Regulations – Regulation 16.A6.4 of the National Treasury Regulations that you had now become aware of.    Yes.    Thank you.    Indeed thank you Chair.  Mr Burger the learned Chairperson asks you why you did not go to get advice and it would have made sense.  If you had gone and got advice from for example as the Chair has suggested from the head office legal person and the head office legal person might have felt well let us bring in an attorney or an advocate as often happens with entities such as this.   We have internally two different views which one legally is correct?  We get objective independent advice.  If that had been on your side – if the advice from Senior Counsel or whoever or from the head of legal at head office had said, in fact Mr Burger is right the regulation 16.A6.4 or whatever it is actually did apply here, Mr Mlambo is right – is wrong Burger is right.  That would have vindicated you not so?    Yes.  It would have protected you.  It would have made you look good.  If on the other hand the advice was no Mlambo is correct and Burger is wrong then the advice would have been this is what we need to do about it?  At least you would have looked good in this sense that you would have been accountable and showing initiative and saying well we have got this difference of opinion as you have put it to the Chair a moment ago let us have somebody determine which of us is right and whoever is found to be wrong is then told that they are wrong and we can then move on and take corrective action.  But here you seem to have done nothing.   May I ask you Mr Burger what was the point of you asking Mr Mlambo for approval if when he refuses to give approval and gives his reasons for rejecting approval you then do nothing?  Surely there was a problem here.  That is why you were asking for approval.  If you felt relaxed about this you would not have asked him in the first place, not so?    Yes.    Yes you need – you needed his approval.    You knew that you needed his approval.    Correct?    You knew why – why did you know that you needed his approval?    Yes.  So now he does not give your – give you his approval so do you have a problem?  You now know at least by now you may not have known it previously if in your lack of knowledge previously you were not aware that it was necessary but at least by now you knew that it was necessary that is why you asked for it.  And you put up some reasons and he comes back to you and says, your reasons are not good enough, they are not relevant reasons, they are not persuasive reasons I am not going to approve it.  But you do not do anything to deal with it.   Is the answer perhaps not simply this that at a pragmatic level the reality was the CEO had already signed it?  So if Mr Mlambo was saying well this was done improperly, irregularly and he is not going to approve it where you knew he had to approve it well tough we will just carry on.  Was that – was that what went on in your mind?    So a lack of guidance by whom?    But he was giving you guidance.     He was not not giving you guidance he was giving you guidance.    Which you just refused to understand.    So you will not take approvals with – sorry orders without approval, is that what you saying?    Yes.    But is that not what you did?    Did you not place orders after this note was issued?  Or did you write or speak to VR Laser and say, I am sorry we cannot implement this contract.  I want to; I think that Mr Mlambo is being difficult but I am sorry we cannot place orders?    Yes.    Yes.    I am interested in the – in the issue about frustration and of course the law does cause complications and frustrations for business and government officials but the law is the law.  Now you used a phrase earlier and I may have misheard it but I think you said you felt that we were often strangling ourselves too much with the PFMA.  I am not sure if the notes that I made of your comment is quite correct but is that what you were saying?    Or meaning?    Well can I ask you what you did think?  You were frustrated, you knew that Mr Mlambo and Ms Malahlela were giving you advice based on their expert knowledge of the PFMA, the National Treasury Regulations that you were now so happily quoting from and being told by Mr Mlambo you have got it wrong.    So were you saying well I am – I did not respond to Mr Mlambo and I did not take it higher – I did not take it for example to the Group Legal Advisor to get a properly considered view because I was frustrated?    Mr Burger may I suggest to you that if you did in fact do something you would have remembered it.    This was surely a major issue.  You had now been advised and decided that it was necessary to get the approval of the Group Supply Chain Executive because that approval was necessary in terms of the Supply Chain Management Policies and that you had to get it in order to process further orders.  Correct?    And …    Sorry Chair.    May I proceed?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Burger I would like you to leave aside Bundle 1 now.  I would like to go back to Bundle 10 which contains your affidavits.      Yes.    Chair subject to your guidance I would be happy with a break but may I suggest respectfully that we finish this particular topic with the last few questions.    And then take a break because I was going to ask in any event for an opportunity to chat with my team.    Members to see what other issues we want to raise.    We getting very near the end.    I had hoped that we be finished by five o’clock in any event.    Thank you Chair.  What I am suggesting is just to complete this line.    Which should take about five minutes.    No more then take the break then.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Burger please turn now in Bundle 10 to page 720.  Have you got that?    Yes Chair.    20.    This is part of your affidavit and it is a section where you were dealing with a response to various questions that were being put to you by members of the investigation team, is that right?     And in that paragraph 162, the question that you have quoted in italics, that comes from the     You did not feel it appropriate that you should raise it.  You simply left it to him because he was at head office, is that right?     And then you continue    Mr Motsepe, yes.       Zulake Ntshepe.     He was Group CEO, correct?     Yes.  And he, in fact, did overrule Mr Mlambo in the note that we have seen.     That followed Mr Mlambo’s concerns.  So am I right in understanding, you felt that at divisional level, if Mlambo does not like what I am doing – and he has already given his reasons for that – he can raise it higher up than himself and that is what he did.       Yes.  But would you agree that it is not right to imagine, as you suggested here, it was his right to authority to uphold your approach and reject Mr Mlambo’s approach if that in breach of that law?  You would accept that the Group CEO cannot do something unlawfully?     Ja.  Now just while we are here.  On     Did he say that?  Or is that something that you just inferred from what he was saying?     It is not in any of the words that we do have in front of us, in the documents for example that we have looked at a moment ago.  He raised a number of concerns that you have now acknowledged at legitimate.       Based on the provisions of the Supply Chain Management policy.  Nowhere do you see anything     So where did you pick that up from?     Yes.  Did ...[intervenes]      I would just like to ask one follow-up questions before we ask for the stand-down.     And that is.  Even if you had answered that question – asked that question and even if you had decided that it was in the interest of Denel, despite the fact that there were so much controversy with the Gupta’s, that the deal should have been done.   Does the fact not that there was controversy about them, did not that provide all the more reason for you, if you were really genuinely concerned about doing the right thing for Denel and its image, that you should have made absolutely sure that everything was squeaky clean as far as compliance with the law and with procurement policies was concerned?     Chair, may we then ask for a brief stand-down, perhaps around ten, maybe 15-minutes maximum and then my team will be able to give their input and we will be able to complete.     I do not believe we should need more than about ten minutes thereafter.     I understand from Mr Crouse that there is at least one aspect on which he, as he has indicated to me, he may want to re-examine.     But it should not be very long.     Thank you.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Just a few follow-up questions and then we will be done.  The evidence earlier relating to officials becoming too entangled in the PFMA, that was a view that was expressed by some legal people.  Was that people within your legal department who were suggesting that some officials were imagining that the PFMA was more complicated than it really was?  Sorry, just switch on your mic, please?     Yes.     And can you recall who said that?     Okay.  Then you were asked questions about that letter that you sent to Mr Mlambo where you referred to Treasury Regulation 16A, etcetera.  How did it come about that you got that advice?  What prompted you to get that advice?     Mr Teubes?     And the reason why you went to them for their advice and input was because you and they realised that Mr Mlambo had to approve this in terms of the policy.     Right.  Can I ask you in bundle 10, still looking at your statement.     To turn please to page 646, paragraph 86 and 87 at the top.  646.        In fact let us start, if we may, on the     Alright.  And then the top of the next     And presumably on the strength of that it came as no surprise to you that the following year in 15 he was encouraging you to appoint to appoint VR Laser as a single source supplier of DLS.     Now you gave evidence on the previous occasion that you did not feel that this was necessarily appropriate but you left the politics to him and as it happened for technical business reasons, not political favouritism or anything like that, but for good business reasons for Denel you felt it would be a good idea to give VR Laser a single source supply contract, is that right?     Yes.  But I want to go back to a line of questioning I put to you earlier and ask you with the benefit of some time since I asked you the first question in that regard, whether you have reflected on it, whether or not it was a good business idea for Denel to go into a single source supply agreement with VR Laser - I am talking here about DLS specifically – whether or not you felt that was good and whether or not you felt well, this is a good opportunity, I can now exploit this opportunity to get a supplier that I have always liked and want now,.  Should you not have actually reported that to somebody, that Saloojee had effectively been pressurising you to give business to VR Laser because of what you say he said, political clout, in other words, their connections, not their business credentials.  He obviously is accountable for whatever he said.  He, of course, denies that and he will be asked questions in that regard but what about your own accountability?  If your superior, albeit your superior, albeit that he was – he had more senior position in the group than you and you were accountable to him, surely you are accountable also as an official to the nation at large and if somebody is making such a proposition to you which clearly is inappropriate, was it not incumbent on you to report that?     Are you saying that Mr Saloojee indicated to you a number of time that he was under political pressure in the sense that he was being pressurised by politicians to ensure that work from Denel was given to political favourites such as the Guptas?     So what did you understand by his reference to his being under political pressure?     But should you not have seen that at least when he was saying to you in 2014 you should be giving favourable treatment to VR Laser because they have political clout?  What else could that mean?     But that he was saying to you people want you to favour them in business not because they are good but because they are politically connected.  Is that not exactly what he was saying, according to your evidence.     Thank you, Chair.  I just have one topic still to raise and that is after Mr Mlambo again refused to approve the single source supply contract retrospectively.  Did you then take the matter up with Mr Ntshepe, the CEO?  How did …[intervenes]     No, I am not asking …[intervenes]     But I am asking who raised it with Mr Ntshepe at the level of Group CEO the fact that there was now a need for a decision?  Earlier you said you believed that once Mlambo was refusing to approve it would be dealt with higher up but in fact we know that Mr Ntshepe then signed.  He said approved and then he signed.     I am talking about the single source supply agreement.     Yes.     But – if I can just have a moment, Chair?  If you look please in bundle 1.  Have got bundle 1, page 824?  This is a document we looked at earlier.     824, yes, Chair.     Yes but if you look at the second last     And the MOA was the single source – single supplier agreement.     Yes.     Yes, but it did reflect the fact that the MOA had been found by Ms Malahlela and later by Mr Mlambo not to be in compliance with the procurement policy.     Yes.  So how did – who took the matter to Mr Ntshepe and obtained his signature as approved on the foot of page 825?     Now Mr Mlambo has testified that after he wrote what appears in handwritten form in the middle of page 825 he was effectively ignored.  You did not come back to him, other executives did not come back to him, Mr Ntshepe never came back to him, he found out later through the backdoor, as it were, that Mr Ntshepe had just sommer approved this, overruled him and did not engage in any discussion with him let alone with you and with him.     You confirm that as far as your understanding goes.     Right.  May I just have a moment, Chair?  In fact I am reminded that Mr Ntshepe himself gave evidence here.  When he was asked how long it would have taken if Mr Mlambo’s questions and concerns had been addressed and taken seriously, how long would it have taken, for example, to put up a proper business reason.  He said about a day.  Can your evidence seriously be correct that there was such urgency to this matter that needed an immediate decision by the CEO thereby ignoring the Group Supply Chain Executive’s concerns?     Thank you, Chair, we have no further questions.     Yes.     It was.     That is my understanding Chair and that would have been Mr Ntshepe.    The demo elements in the first paragraph do relate to guns as we understand it, or something related to guns.     Yes, and he discounted that.     Can I just ask your indulgence just to ask a follow up question just to try and get some clarity on the issue.   Ms Malahlela gave evidence as I recall in explaining the memorandum that she wrote at page A24, do you have that?     A24, that this was specifically asking for approval retrospectively for the MOA for the single supplier contract, and what she was doing in paragraph – in the first paragraph that refers to the T5 demo was simply reminding Mr Mlambo that previously he had given approval for the T5 demo as she says in giving the approval for the deviation from the normal procurement process and list of supplies to be used for the T5 demo the Group Supply Chain Executive, that is Mr Mlambo, gave an instruction that DLS must first explore how Denel Vehicle Systems ...[indistinct] ratio and LNT inter-group companies will be used in the project on condition that they meet the quality, then she reminds him of what appears in the supply chain policy and then says having identified a need for a single source supplier for the supply of steel components in May 2015 DLS signed an MOA. So the first paragraph was simply referring to a historic fact that  had already occurred, namely he had approved previously the special procurements by way of a deviation for the T5 demo but subject to specific conditions, try and deal with him them in-house, so she was just reminding him of his approach previously which said don’t go outside the group if you can go inside the group, and now she is saying after reminding him of what the supply chain policy says in that regard requiring a sound business case to be made out, she now says there has already been an MOA recently, in May 2015, five months earlier, with VR Laser for the single supplier and on the basis of what you have already Mr Mlambo raised in relation to the earlier approve for T5 and in relation to bearing in mind what the procurement policy requires may we now ask you for approval, well she is saying not herself but Exco has said may we now ask for your approval, not of the T5 demo contract, but of placing orders under the MOA for single supplier, that is my understanding.  Am I correct?      But Mr Burger may I take you back to the minutes if my colleagues can just help me with the reference.     Yes. MR BURGER;   That I remember.     Yes. MR BURGER;   And that because of that conflict but my understanding was to – there is a conflict so placing an order now there is a conflict, can we please get approval to place the order.     Yes, but that is a conflicted – that relates to the MOA or the single source ...[intervenes]      And because how people formulated it was the framework for the debate was which takes precedence, which trumps the other, does the MOA trump the procurement policy or does the procurement policy trump the MOA, not so?     But in the placement of any order going forward, not so?     Yes, if I can take you back to the minutes, page 672 in the same  bundle.     Yes.  Under the heading resolution, committee took a decision that the MOU takes precedence over the GSCE’s condition and the Group Supply Chain policy.   Now the condition related to the T5 demo previously not so?  That was his condition correct?     Yes and the Group Supply Chain Policy and the DLS Supply Chain Procedure and that is why – that is why Mr Mlambo was then approached after this resolution was taken in Ms Malahlele’s memo so it specifically related to requesting approval by the Group Supply Chain Executive Mr Mlambo of orders being placed under the MOA single supply contract, is that right?     Okay, thank you very much, thank you Chair, no further questions.     Chair that is all we have for you in formal open session today, may we then ask for the matter to stand down and may I approach you chambers just to confirm arrangements in relation to the two remaining witnesses in the Denel stream. 
MR BURGER:  Huge pleasure Chair.    Abraham Stephanus Burger    No.    I truly affirm.    Yes Chair I do.    I recall Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Yes I have Chair.    I learnt that from her evidence yes Chair.    As I – as I stated in my affidavit the – the first time I heard about not being happy with the process followed was – was in – in the early parts of 2016 when she first mentioned this to me in – in the passing and said we did not follow correct procedure.  I was surprised to hear that.  Shortly thereafter there was an EXCO meeting and where I recall it was raised again and then this was in 16 and then she followed it up with an email to me when I was overseas and I know I reacted quite sharply on her email because I thought the way she put it in the email was – was in a much more serious tone than what I heard it in the passing and at the EXCO meeting and I thought that was serious enough to be discussed on a one on one basis or in a committee and not writing an email while I was abroad.  So yes that is when I found out Chair.    I – I cannot recall that.  I really cannot recall that – it being discussed.    I cannot recall – I would not have reacted in the way I did and stated at that time – this is four years’ ago this is the first time apart from raising it in the passing is the first time that you now officially raise it with me.  So that is why I say at the time in 2016 I could not remember that she did.  I can less so now – so…    I can less so now recall that she – she mentioned anything of the likes to me.  I saw – I heard in the affidavit that it was discussed with Mr Teubes.  I was – I was – I cannot recall any of that currently.    I cannot recall Chair.    I – I have not even read it Chair so I – I…    I cannot recall this.    I – I did not see this email.  I cannot recall.  I recall this email from the evidence that was given recently – I cannot recall this email – having seen this email then.    Okay.    Chair this – it is really difficult to recall.  He might have asked my opinion on – do – what is my opinion?  Should we go out on open tender or on closed tender for that matter?  My opinion at the time was I stated it quite a number of times that the way to go out on open tender with something like this or on – firstly to go out on open tender is – is more or less impossible.  The – to do it on a closed tender – multiple tender is to prepare drawings; is to supply potential single source suppliers with these drawings for them to – to tender a price, demonstrate their capability, demonstrate their quality and so on; on an actual example and then…    Ja.    I recall that vividly Chair.    Chair I cannot recall.  I was – I was however of the opinion that a process was followed a year earlier and based on that I did not feel it necessary to go out on a tender again.  That was my opinion at the time but I cannot recall this being discussed.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    It makes sense to me now Chair.  At the time it did not but it does now.    Chair I am running the risk of repeating myself but at the time I state again I got an instruction; I welcomed the instruction; I – it was minuted in the EXCO minutes of Denel Land Systems.  I wanted to make very sure that the – the engineers and the operation supported that – that initiative.  I told Mr Teubes that we should do this and for that reason he ensured that the engineers did a study and to – that it was supported by the study.  The emails that followed it is very clear if it is analysed that I was not – I did not want to sign the MOU or the MOA.  I instructed in that it must be Mr Saloojee.  So it is all of these things that – that demonstrates that this does not – did not – the initiative did not come from me.  The very fact that in the past we used to on lower levels approve MOA’s probably made me not focus enough and understand enough that we should have gone out on tender.  In today’s current scenario we should have gone out on tender; we did not.  I – at the time I did not think it necessary.    Chair.    Hundred percent Chair.  Prior – prior to 14 earlier 2010 thereabouts I cannot remember the exact date a person like the Supply Chain Executive without further authority approved Single Source Agreements.  Because we believed it had certain advantages for the company.  If the – if the Group CEO said we should do something like this I was hundred percent convinced at the time that this was within his delegation to do.  I knew and I said that my delegations were curtailed quite substantially but I was under the impression if that gets approved by the Group CEO then it is fine.  And that was my departure point and therefore I did not give it a lot of concern until now.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    I have got it Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair I cannot – cannot remember.  I know about this email I cannot remember who said what but I presume it was her that raised those points.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Ja.  Chair I cannot recall the exact date.  I know it was substantially later.  I know there was an EXCO meeting where it was discussed maybe it was this one and it was October 2015 I cannot recall.    The – but as I said it was – it was discussed in an EXCO meeting.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Yes.  Correct.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    In my mind at the time there was a policy and that policy was a Denel written policy and that policy the custodian of that policy my understanding was the Group CEO.  So what is – what is written here is not hundred percent my understanding.  The resolution was that our recommendation is very strong that there is a legal contract between us and VR Laser and that legal contract must be respected.   There is a conflict between the contract and group policies.  And my understanding at the time was, the group policies is an internal matter and therefore can be accepted by the necessary level of authority. So.  And for that reason I said not to get into a legal dispute with a valid contract.  The precedence should be on the contract but we should get approval from our bosses that we can do this. So I cannot recall Chair that we took a decision and just implemented it based on that decision.  We took a decision as a recommendation to hire(?) and if I recall correctly, there was a motivation that was written that was sent to Denel’s corporate office in this regard.     At the time, I was most definitely aware that it was a breach of any laws.  I was aware that it was a breach of the Denel of the procurement policy. And Chair, I have to say.  This Single Source Agreement was not a document that was kept in a dark corner and nobody knew about it. Every single body knew about this and including my boss at the time.  And for that reason, if we did something unlawful and incorrectly, there should have been action or there would have been action taken. So Chair, I – at the time I knew about Ms Malahlela’s concern.  There was a discussion.  She raised her objections.   There were many people sitting around the table.  I was the chairperson of that meeting.  I tried to summarise the discussion and it is written in the resolution and therefore we went to corporate office with the resolution. So Chair, I have got really not anything to add to that.     Correct.     Correct, Chair.     Chair, I got an instruction to form a Single Source Agreement with VR Laser.  The content or the objective of that Single Source Agreement was minute in Exco meetings.  And I was under the impression that it was approved at the correct levels. So by the same token, the very same person that signed that agreement also signed the policy and also approved the policy for Denel. So I thought if there was a conflict between the two, it is easier to deal with an internal matter than an external matter.   And for that reason I said, I support – and it was not my decision, this was a committee decision that was minute here.   For that reason I supported that this – that we should uphold the contract between us and VR Laser.  But at no     Chair.  [laughs]  It is a difficult question and I understand why you ask it.  I thought it – me, though that it made absolute business sense at the time why that Single Source Agreement existed and therefore there were good business reasons for it and given the good business reasons, I thought the Group CEO could override the policy.  I really thought so.     I also agree that he cannot just do what he wants.     I understand.  I understand your concern.  So, yes he cannot do what he wants but I was under the impression this was for good business reasons and given the good business reasons, yes.     Ja, Chair.  Hindsight is perfect sign.      Yes.     It was not done.     Well, not that I can recall Chair.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Chair, no.  I think that is, with great respect, taking the point a little bit far.  The policy is there to govern the organisation and to make sure that good decisions as a norm but like everything in life there are always exceptions and that does not mean that one can ignore the policy.   It means, in my mind, that if you are doing something that is not stipulated in the policy then you have to get approval at the correct level of the organisation.   And in my mind, this – having a policy like it is better to manufacture something internally than externally.  It is a good policy.   I agree with the policy.  I am not questioning the policy.  But in this specific case, with the problems we had, with the risk we were running – I have already indicated this would have been a good place where we have complex fabricated steelworks done.   And Chair, my apology for saying it again.  It is also common knowledge that you have – when you deal with highly complex things, having Single Source Agreement is not a bad thing.  It is a good thing in this complex environment.   So I did support it.  I supported the idea then.  I support the idea now.  But it does not take away that the policy is a good policy and it makes sense in general terms.     I do agree Chair but to qualify that.  I also thought and this how all decisions worked that if his boss and his boss’s boss listen to the arguments, they had the authority to decide what is the best for the company.     Ja.     Ja. ADV KENNEDY     Ja.     I do accept.     Yes ...[intervenes]      Correct, Chair.     My I repeat Chair?  I reject the fact that it was overruled by me.  I state again.  There was a meeting held that consisted of executive members.  She raised her concerns.  It was discussed.  A resolution was taken by the committee, not by me, by the committee.  And a joint resolution was written down.       Sorry, sorry.     In this resolution, it is not minute that Ms Malahlela raised her objection about the decision.  It was taken as a group, a group discussion and a group resolution. And Chair, I hear what Mr Kennedy is saying but at the time it was an Executive Committee meeting and a joint resolution was taken.  It was not just – it was discussed and it was accepted.     Chair, in all meetings there are difference of opinions.  In all meetings.       In all meetings, there a differences of opinions and ...[intervenes]      She was – she put her point on the table and she was against it.     Correct.     How these meetings usually happen.  I am the chairperson.  The chairperson does not say, I – what you say is nonsense.  I will – I think it should be different.  How it happens, everybody gets an opportunity to state their opinion and I ...[intervenes]      I repeat again.  The – I formulated the consensus view of the meeting and that is written in the resolution.     I supported it.     [No audible reply]      I ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Chair?     Remember I said ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Correct Chair.  I – why I was hesitating is, is I wanted to qualify.  The word overruled is a very strong word.  I do not recall – and maybe the other members that was in this meeting should divulge – but I cannot recall by     Ja.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair, I ...[intervenes]      Correct.     Correct, Chair.      No, Chair we did not.     Because I held the view at the time that it – it was within the mandate of the Group CEO to sign something like this and that it was a document that was done according to the policy or to the Delegation of Authority.   I have to add, however, that this – the time when the arguments became stronger, was the time when the press became more vocal about the Gupta involvement. So – and the opinion of me was that that was not my place to give an opinion of that.  But from a – from Ms Malahlela’s side, she was vocal on that she did not support the idea of tarnishing Denel’s name of the link between the Gupta’s, and that was, in my mind, her real concern.   And therefore, I took note of what was said.  Everybody around the table took note of what was said and the resolution was taken.     Chair, if I recall correctly.  It started late 15.  It started with everything.  In the beginning of 2016, there was a quite a lot of media attention.     I am not suggesting anything.  I am just saying that the - Ms Malahlela thought it will bring Denel in disrepute and, I mean, she was correct.     [No audible reply]      Ja, ja.     I did Chair.     Correct, Chair. ADV KENNEDY     Correct, Chair.     For sure.     Chair, I am not sure what I should say on what was ...[intervenes]      Okay Mr Kennedy.  Sorry, Chair.  Quite a lot of statements were made.     And I cannot recall them.  Just a word of correction.  I did acknowledge that she was correct in her summation.  I do acknowledge that.     Secondly, I want to state again that she gave her inputs and her inputs were taken seriously at the time.  It was not just overruled, just ignored.  I think the word that was used.  Her inputs were acknowledged and taken.  The ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Chair?     Not followed.     No, not followed after a discussion within the Executive Committee.     It is – I never realised she was that traumatised by what happened.  I was also hoping that she had due to the cultural that existed in Denel Land Systems, she really felt part of Denel and wanted to do the best for Denel.  I accept all of that.  And ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.  Having looked at her and seeing what she has gone through of course I feel deeply moved.  If one takes cognisance of my own affidavit and the circumstances in which I left Denel I can truly sympathise with her.  My situation was very similar so I can really sympathise with her.     Say again?     She was correct, Chair.     But …[intervenes]     No.  No, Chair, Mr Kennedy is laying words in my mouth.  I am saying I can sympathise with her because I had a scenario that over years responsibilities, accountabilities …[intervenes]     Yes.     I do, Chair.     I do, Chair.     Chair …[intervenes]     Chair, I cannot take away the frustration and the objective I wanted to reach to have various suppliers of good competency delivering with quick turnarounds to Denel Land Systems and I cannot – I cannot take away the feeling I had then and I still have today that all things being equal, VR Laser was a good company to form a single source agreement with.  So that is on the one side on my emotion or on my feelings. On the other side, she was correct.  She was correct that the mere fact that VR Laser is today bankrupt, does not exist anymore, it was a bad decision in taking what happened up to now.   So if that decision was such a good decision at the time then Denel should be delivering hulls now for a month.  That did not happen because they are bankrupt, so – for whatever reason.  So that emotion is also in me that if only I had a crystal ball and only I could see, look into the future.  The one thing I can say about Ms Malahlela, I had huge respect for her, she was – her work ethic was extremely high and she – her recommendations were always based on what she thought was the best for the company.  I, however, at the time expected that from everybody, not just her, everybody in the division. So, Chair, I can only acknowledge the facts are the facts.  The whole single source agreement and the whole agreement today is a mess and it is to the detriment of Denel.  So therefore she was obviously correct in her assessment and I acknowledge that but there was no way at the time for us to have known that, so …[intervenes]     No, Chair, I did not.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     No, Chair, I did not.     No argument, I …[intervenes]         Ja.  Chair, I understand that when you are CEO of a division of a company, want to know what is in the policies …[intervenes]     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     No, Chair, it was not but I know that should be case, one should study the policies and one should know the policies.  These policies, this specific policy also changed every so often and I was really focused on growing the burns unit and not try – and not being  bureaucrat and making sure that all policies being adhered to, I was – at the time I was focusing on growing the business, having meetings with the clients and I was away a lot of times from the company travelling abroad.  So it is a mistake, it is a fault on my side but that was what the situation was at the time.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct.  Correct, Chair.     If you say so, Chair.       Yes, Chair.     Yes, that is my name.     Correct.     Ja.  In matters like this I would not have the knowledge, Chair, and I still do not have the knowledge but I am – if I remember correctly, this letter in all probability would have - I would have requested the head of legal at Denel Land Systems, Ms Denise Govender to …[intervenes]     Ja, to support …[intervenes]     To support my – in all likelihood, yes.     Chair, I really cannot remember.  What surprises me here, this letter was written in October 2015, the first letter.  I cannot remember when he wrote his note. I do not know when Mr Ntshepe approved it.  This letter is six months later, you know, in 29 April 2016.     So I can remember frustration.     Lots of frustration, that I can remember, but …[intervenes]     Both probably.     Both probably.     Oh yes, for sure.     Yes, my …[intervenes]     Head of legal supported me in writing this letter, yes.  I am pretty convinced, I am not saying hundred percent.     I agree, Chair.     You are right, I agree.     Ja …[intervenes]     That was my impression at the time, yes.     On the previous – on the October one?  Are you referring to the October one?     Yes?     For the single source agreement, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     I said VR Laser is great and we have got an agreement with them.     Correct, Chair.     Ja.  Once should – the letter is probably not complete, you are correct.  The point we wanted to raise was we have got an agreement and they are a good company to have an agreement with …[intervenes]     Ja.  And that was my main thrust of the letter.     Correct.     You are right and I also did not go through the whole argument of why …[intervenes]     Yes, I was trying t say, Chair, the reason I did not do that was because I did not also write a long story about the DVS was not a fabrication house.  Yes, they did make hulls in the past and also the frustrations and the technical failures we had with other products we placed on the LMT, so I did not go through those arguments.  At the time when we wrote the letter we thought we will get approval based on those arguments.     Chair I cannot argue with you, the long and the short was there were different camps.     And Ms Malahlela and Mr Mlambo both felt that V R Laser was not the right company to place an order on.  I have to qualify what I am saying now, Ms Malahlela still supported V R Laser in the early days, in 2014 to the middle of 2015, it then changed and it was clear that Mr Mlambo was not in support of VR Laser doing business for all the reasons given.  The opinion I had at the time it had more to do with what’s going on in the public domain than what their capability was and never could anybody say they are not good at what they are doing.  Everybody agreed they were good at what they were doing. So there were different schools of thought and from my perspective I thought it was a good idea and therefore I supported it.  In hindsight you are absolutely right, I should have written a letter that is more wise, the risk of doing that and was – if I write a motivation letter because of all these policy reasons and all these governance reasons it is better to go to LNT than or to DBS than to VR Laser, I am sure that he will not support the idea.  I knew what his position was, it was not a surprise to me, I knew what his position was and therefore I tried to put the relevant issues on the email, but in hindsight Chair yes, I mean ...[intervenes]      Correct Chair.     Correct Chair.      No Chair I have to repeat the time when this became public knowledge and became a real problem was more or less around when this letter was written.     It wasn’t prior to that so much in our faces.  So it was only later on ...[intervenes]     No correction, correction Chair.   It is true that we became knowledgeable about the press situation I cannot recall saying it became intense at the end of 2015, but I do recall around middle of 2016 it started getting intense but I knew about it at the end of 2015, yes I did, but it wasn’t intense at that stage.         Chair, and I am running a big risk of repeating myself, which I don’t want to do, but we went through a process wherein the highest authority in the company supported this, gave instructions to do this and for all the reasons I had given we thought it was a good idea and we also had the scenario which I explained about the press articles in India where single articles can really influence the future of a company and I did state earlier that that made me realise that I should not pay too much attention to what is going on in the press, and that we should do what is the best for the company and I have tried to do that. Yes, both Mr Mlambo and Ms Malahlela did raise their concerns but this was at a later stage after the agreement was signed, so I had an option, I had an option to cancel the agreement based on the media and Ms Malahlela and Mr Mlambo or make sure that it is supported by Denel and as I said on numerous occasions the whole media coverage was not done on a divisional level or the image of the company, that was done by corporate and I said we have here a valid agreement, I am not sure on what basis I would have cancelled it, and for that reason I supported the agreement, that it was a valid agreement.   In my life in Denel I always thought Denel employees were very good at the initial stages of partnering with people, it – and my opinion was always that early stages of partnership was a good time, but when the going got tough Denel didn’t always honour their commitments to their partners and I wanted to make sure that if we have a partnership agreement with somebody that we do our bit to uphold the agreement, so that was in my mind always, I never ever, and I say this again, thought that there was a conflict with the law, that never passed by – I was under the impression this was supported by the group, there were people both Ms Malahlela and Mr Mlambo that did not support it and therefore I wrote these letters to say please approve it and if it is not approved then higher authority must take the decision.     Correction Chair, the Group CEO was not persuaded to sign the agreement, he gave me instruction to sign it and all the evidence with supporting documentation is there to prove that he gave me instruction to do that, so it was from that perspective.     I cannot speculate on behalf of corrupt and illegal activities Chair, what I can say is that the passion and the beliefs I had then are the passion and beliefs I still have today.  I cannot speak on behalf of other people and on behalf of the Guptas, I don’t know them.  The problem here is that it is so much easier to distance yourself from this mess and I would not be able to live with myself to say it wasn’t me, it was my boss that instructed me to do it, I didn’t want to do it but it was him that instructed me and by doing that clear my name.  I am trying to bring across what actually happened and if we can take one little step back and I will cover both of them now for you. The hulls contract was not supported by me, it was supported by everybody in Denel Land Systems, all the senior personnel and there’s emails to prove that.   The single source agreement was supported by all the executives because they thought it was the right thing to do at the time.   Yes, Mr Mlambo and Ms Malehlela did raise the concerns and they did say these things but at the time when we were in the trenches fighting the fight we really, we really thought that was the best thing and it was not my opinion, it was the opinion of all the executives in Denel Land Systems. So that is the first point, the second point is looking back Chair it is a mess, the place is bankrupt and they are not producing any health so obviously I wish I could turn back the clock and say let’s try and do it in a different way, for sure I would have done that.  The one thing I would want to say however is the reason why this is in a mess is for whatever the reasons and whatever their association by the owners they could not have a bank account and they are bankrupt as a result of that  So too is LNT bankrupt today, not because – or in business rescue, not because it did not place a hull contract on it but because they could not execute their orders, so whatever decision I would have taken at the time be it VR Laser or LNT I would sit today and say I am sorry that I took that decision it would have been the wrong decision because both instances would not have been able to produce the hulls.  So with the benefit of hindsight Chair I wish I could have it differently, I wish I could have done it differently, for sure I would have, but at the time I had a certain opinion and I am reflecting that opinion I had the and I did not change my opinion from then to now for whatever reasons there are, I am saying this is what actually happened.     Yes Chair you will recall that just a little earlier I sent him a very long email of ten points or something that I said LNT cannot be trusted to do this so that’s – I didn’t repeat it again.  DVS was in my mind not a fabrication house, it was a vehicle assembly plant so it was for me almost irrelevant, so yes.     83?       Correct, correct Chair.     No I haven’t Chair, apart from saying please discuss this with your line manager.     I understand so yes.     Yes I do.     I absolutely do yes Chair.     Sorry Chair I say again that there were differences of opinion. It would have been my understanding because what he is saying is cancel the agreement with VR Laser.  It would have ...[intervenes]      No he is saying that it is not in – what you read now the agreement is not really valid, should not be valid.   So – and there was a difference of opinion as I said before, so from my perspective if he was – if he felt so strongly then as he is feeling today I would have expected, because he was on all the emails that came from VR Laser for late payment or non-payment he was also copied, I would have also expected him to raise this issue with my – with his bosses to say we have got a dilemma here, this is a problem, I suggest we do the following, go into negotiations with VR Laser, tell them that that agreement is not valid, let us try and get it behind us and let’s do it, proper governance.  I would have expected that to happen.  That never happened.    Correct Chair.    Chair I cannot recall.  I think we had a discussion and agreed to probably and I am guessing now probably agreed to disagree.    But I cannot remember what we actually did about this.    Correct Chair.    Chair I did not.    I did not.    Would have expected.    No it did not.    It could yes Chair.    It probably would have.    Ja.  I did not analyse it as you are analysing now Chair.  It was for me at that time and this is – this is a year of negotiating on the – starting with the hull contracts going through the Single Source Agreement, going through these other agreements I knew very well what is – what his position was. He did not support the Single Source Agreement and whilst there were many others that did support the Single Source Agreement.   I was not in my mind equipped enough to have a legal argument with him with regards to what is correct and what is not correct in PFMA.  The feedback I got numerous occasions was that the PFMA is sometimes we strangle ourselves too much with the PFMA and there is room for more flexible decision making within the PFMA.  And for that reason I did not even try to venture there because I knew I would tie myself up in knots if I had that.   And I also stated earlier that – that he was very knowledgeable of these facts and I accept that and I – but at the time I can only say what happened was I – I got his feedback; I – it was not such a big surprise to me and it confirmed that he was on the one side and we are on the other side.    Yes.    I understand and I take your point Chair.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    It is not about feeling relaxed it is about the process dictated that we should…    We should get his approval for.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Because I know the Delegations of Authority.    I stated in my affidavit a couple of times Chair that I – I was frustrated with the decision making at group level.  It is a frustration I cannot hide it – it was there.  I was also frustrated with – with in my mind the – the lack of guidance and the – and the number of stumbling blocks we experienced when we brought things like this to head office.    By people like Mr Dennis Mlambo.  So…    No I am saying in general.    I understand.    But – but the – and this was a build-up over a long period of time.  So to answer your question I was frustrated.  I do not take that feeling away and it was there.  And maybe there is some truth in what you saying in the back of my mind I said I here you, I take note of what you saying but you know what the document is approved by the Group CEO I will not – I will not place orders without approval but I will probably take things like this to higher levels of authority.    No I am saying we will – if he rejects something like this we will not just place an order.    We…    I cannot remember the…    Chair you talking about the Single Source Agreement    Okay.  Now I am talk – I am referring to separate orders on the back of the Single Source Agreement.  So we went through the process if it was within a certain level of delegation we would take it to the Group CEO.  So – but you asked me a question earlier, was it not – was it not a feeling of it was approved by the Group CEO and I am trying to give context to the fact that maybe there was an element of truth in that.    I – I was frustrated and I felt look going – talk your troubles out with your boss – your Group CEO and give me guidance.  I was frustrated.    I am…    That was the opinion held by certain legal people that said any organisations sometimes act too conservatively and because of acting too conservatively as a result of the PFMA misses opportunities that there might be and that the PFMA is more lenient than what we think.  That was – that was opinions people gave in the passing like for instance the legal people within Denel Land Systems.  So I am not saying that is what I thought I am just saying..    Ja.    No I would not – I would not have received this and done nothing.  I just cannot remember.  In all probability had a discussion with the Group CEO and say what must I do?    Ja.    Correct Chair and if – if the impression I held was the Group Supply Chain Executive needed in all accounts needed to be consulted I was under the impression that if higher authority listened to both sides of the story they could make a call – a judgment call what is the right thing to do or not to do.  That was my – that was my thinking at the time and my impression at the time.    Sorry Chair that was a different point.    That was – I was responding to getting his – his signoff on orders or not his signoff on orders.    But to your point.    The – I am reflecting.    To say that …    Yes.    Yes.    It was – yes.    Yes.    Okay.    No.    I think Chair you heard correctly.  Let me try and rephrase it to be absolutely clear.  There – there were discussions within the Denel Land Systems EXCO.  If you – and there were views held that some – by different people also by legal people that – that sometimes we apply the PFMA too strictly and strangle ourselves in doing that.  The arguments put on the table when – during those discussions without knowing the PFMA – without sitting down and studying the full implication of the PFMA I supported that view because it made logical sense to me that the – the PFMA should not be that rigid.   So you can also include me in that discussion because I supported that view.  What was clear to me at the time was there were different – differences of opinion on how to interpret the PFMA and that – that is why I refer my legal person – supported me in that letter that I wrote to Mr Mlambo I referred to the – to those paragraphs.   But Chair I just – I just want to say something and speeding as an example and sorry to do that is very clear – it is very unambiguous.  You drive at 60 kilometres you supposed to not drive that faster than 60 kilometres.  If you drive faster than 60 kilometres and somebody catches you you will be caught and there will be a fine.  Very unambiguous and very clear.   What I have come to learn in the last weeks and months is that I – I was wrong.  I was wrong in the sense that the PFMA is not so flexible.  The PFMA is actually fairly clear and if I reflect back I would say it is – it is like a Formula 1 driver trying to win a race within the Road Ordinance Act trying to win a trace.  And the law is very clear you are not supposed to drive faster than 120 or whatever the case may be.  If he complies to the – to the rules of 120 kilometres an hour there is no way he can win a race.   So – so – and – but there is very good reasons for 120 kilometres an hour because if you let everybody drive fast at 120 there will be chaos.  So – so I understand that law but – but in my mind we were – we were operating in an environment where quick decision making was necessary; where sometimes you have to drive faster than 120 kilometres an hour.   And for Denel to succeed successfully in the international market I am – I am tempted to say that it is going to be very difficult under the PFMA laws that I understand today which I did not understand so well then but which I understand today.  And my advice would very strongly be it is for the future of Denel probably better to – to operate under a more privately owned scenario and that is just my opinion Chair.  But – but that is the only way I can explain it.    Okay.  No, no, no.  Sorry I – I did not state it clearly enough.  It was …    Correct.    The second one Chair.  The last – the last one.    Correct.    No.  It is a big…    Sorry Chair I am battling to express myself.    I am saying the – it was an opinion held by people that – that we are too critical on ourselves when applying the PFMA and it – it was discussed in the meetings and it was – it was an opinion I also held at the time that we were strangling ourselves.    With the – in the way we were applying the PFMA.    What – what I tried to say to Mr Kennedy was I was not knowledgeable enough on the PFMA so I could not form an independent opinion by – I did not study the PFMA however and that is why I said it was not my opinion that I put on the table to say – to be part of the argument.   It was a – it was an opinion that I shared when there were arguments on the table that – that said we are strangling ourselves with the PFMA I supported the fact that we were strangling ourselves with the PFMA.  But I did not – I did not actively put arguments on the table from a point of knowledge and from a point of expertise.    I am happy Chair.      I am fine.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     I presume you are referring to ...[intervenes]      Correct.  I ...[intervenes]      Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Fully.  I agree Chair.     Chair, I actually said it 15-minutes ago that my opinion was that Mr Mlambo did not particularly support the contract because of the shareholding and the ownership of VR Laser.     I cannot remember his words but maybe it was something that he – that is how it was projected to me.       Yes.     H’m.     The – as an example, when I received the letter from Ms Malahlela when I was overseas – this letter I am referring to her in the first paragraph – I – that was for     The ...[intervenes]      Chair, there was a Public Relations Department.  I cannot remember exactly what it was.  Or a Media Committee or something.  I cannot remember the name of the department.  That dealt with the image of Denel and they dealt with interaction with the press.     Ja, Chair very much so.  I mean, I was told in no uncertain terms by the then Group CEO that this was not a domain I must concern myself about. And so the legitimacy of contracts, because of media or threat of a media scandal was not something I really concerned myself about at that time.  And I tried to explain how the delegations and the accountabilities moved to head office during that time. So, yes, I truly left that to the Group CEO as well as the Media Department to deal with that.     H’m.  Chair, yes, of course, I was concerned about the image of Denel.  I mean, I am still am.     It – at the time, there was much speculation of what is right and what is wrong.  And in 2020, it is much easier to ...[intervenes]      Yes.     H’m.     Correct, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Absolutely Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Chair ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Chair, I state again.  I was – obviously, the image of Denel is and will always be of importance to me.  Number two.  Denel is operating locally and with foreign governments in a very much politically environment. I have soon in my career, took a position that I do not want to be – I do not want to pick sides and I do not want to have an opinion on what is politically correct or incorrect. And that attitude, I must be honest with you, served me well for a fair amount of time but it caught up with me.   The dilemma of picking of political sides is that sometimes you are in and sometimes you are not in and you, as a result, lose your job as a consequence. So I, early on in my life, I said I just want to be a businessman.  I do not want to pick political sides.  And therefore, apart from – while I acknowledge that the image was important to me.  I also did put my head in the ground a little bit when it came to these things. And you are right.  In hindsight, I should have stood up     No, you are right.     I understand fully Chair.     I did not take that view.       I take it – I take your point Chair.  I can only say that during the Single Source Agreement, I was really under the impression this was something that the Group CEO had the authority to do.  That it was in the best interest of Denel.   And by 2016, the agreement was in existence and my view I had then was the horse has been bolted.  If there is evidence of corruption, then we have something to act on.  But in the absence of them being blacklisted or evidence of corruption.  How do you act on that?  And that was my opinion at the time.       Correct, Chair, but this was a general discussion, this was not a VR Laser big discussion.     It is a general view that was …[intervenes]     It was a general view and if I remember correctly, the head of my legal department Ms Denise Govender also held that view.  So but I stand corrected but I am pretty sure that was the scenario.     The normal practice was that any letter that was written for head office – not any letter, in 90% of the time of normal run of the mill letters like approval for certain things would be written by the person that wants to get it approved and I would read it, I would make sure I understand it and I support it and I would sign it.   This letter was one of them and words in that letter, although it was a long time ago, words that were used in the letter were words like inter alia which is a typical legal term and something I would not write now.  I am fairly sure that that letter was not written or I would surprised if that letter was written by Ms Malahlela and for that reason I think it was between the Chief Operating Officer, Mr Reenen Teubes, who wanted to get this contracts placed and our legal department, Ms Denis Govender, that that letter was constructed and there might have been back and forth with the letter and I might have given inputs to it but the bulk that letter was written by – and my guesstimate would be – and/or I am pretty sure by Ms Denis Govender, most of it, with inputs from Mr Reenen Teubes.  What typically…[intervenes]     Ja.  And what typically then would happen is I would scrutinise it, make sure it make sense and so – and then take it to head office.     Correct, on the last bit of the statement and the earlier part of the statement, I did not go to them to say go and write a letter, they wanted – from operations’ side they wanted to place a contract on VR Laser.  We might have had a discussion or they just brought the letter to me to say we need to get approval and therefore they did know that Mr Dennis Mlambo must sign it and presented a letter that, like in most cases, I would go through and sign it off and give inputs, if necessary but I did not initiate that letter, if that was the comment made.     Yes.     I have got it, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, I think knowing what I know now, having listen to evidence given supporting that Mr Saloojee was deeply involved than even what I thought at the time, it would have been the correct thing to do.  I have got no doubt in my mind.  At the time, however, the –what I call political pressures, those things, Mr Saloojee made no bones about the fact that he is under political pressure for many things and that is his domain and I think over a long period of time I got used to the idea or accepted the idea an wrongly so that when a comment is made like that, that it needs to be supported.  If I could have my life over I would have done that, Chair.     No, Chair.  No, I would not go that far.  He did not elaborate in that …[intervenes]     That, well, it is political clout, he is moving in political circles, that he said a number of times to me and he has to conform to those pressures.  I did not see it as anything but – you called it favouritism and maybe that is – it is a good description.  I did not see it as any funny business in that regard.     Ja.     Ja.  No, you are right, Chair, and I – if it was the only case then one can make a big argument about it but it also happened in terms of the [indistinct] 13.58 business that I had to place on them, so – as I indicated in the previous interview.  So it was common knowledge that Mr Saloojee was in general under political pressure and so I -  it is – not just relating to this, in general.  So, you know, with the clarity and the advantage of time passing, you are right, I am not disputing that.  At the time when we were fighting the war, the – I just accepted that that is the way it is and it in principle always been the case.  It is not new to – there has always been some form of political imperatives that needed to be supported.     Yes, Chair?     Chair, it is a wide range of things.     Ja.     Yes.  Things like the transformation of the organisation, the necessity to have deputies and fast-track the deputies to senior positions, the decisions to only appoint black female engineers in a very difficult time to get experienced people and if one argued a different angle to say we have got a programme running, it is good to do 80% of that but let us try and also get experience in, then the argument was understand the enormity of the political pressure.   So those were the more general type – understandable and I am not saying it was incorrect, understandable pressures he was under.  He was – he also comment fairly regularly that the interactions that he had with certain people of importance, if certain people visited the organisation, should be treated in a very special way because of their political position or whatever the case may be.   So it was a wide range of things and in particular he also said there are companies of importance and with political clout that needs to be supported, for whatever reason that may be.     Individuals?     No, Chair.     I cannot remember, it is six years ago, Chair.     He might have mentioned, he might have mentioned.     Sorry, Chair, maybe – there was – I can remember there was a called Tub and I am not hundred percent – I am fairly sure it was Mr Saloojee that said there was a company called Tub and there was a lady owner of that company and he also referred – and I cannot remember her name now.     But he did mention her name specifically …[intervenes]     As a very important person.     Will do, Chair.     I did not have a discussion with – I cannot recall, Chair, whether I did.  My argument would not have been I think we should cancel the single source agreement, I would not have said that.     Based on the inputs given by Mr Mlambo.  Whether – I might have had a discussion with him about his – I am pretty sure I had a discussion with him about his discontent with the whole process, so yes.     Oh sorry, are you talking about the specific T5 contract that was placed?       The single source supply agreement?     No, I took that to Mr Saloojee, Chair, I did not take that to Mr Ntshepe.     824.  Ja, this agreement was not the single source agreement.  This …[intervenes]     This was for a complex fabricated steel plate that was needed for the T5 demo on the back of the single source agreement.       Correct.     Correct.     But this request was for the T5 steel plate.     Correct, Chair.  Correct, Chair.     In all probability, Chair, and I cannot state this a hundred percent but in all probability this was brought back to me by Ms Malahlela and this was a very urgent requirement because we had to go and do a demo and I in all probability took this to Mr Ntshepe.     Yes, Chair.     I cannot recall having a discussion with Mr Mlambo.     Chair, it is impossible to get a quote on something like this in a day.  It is not possible.  So I do not know where he got the day from, it is just not possible to set up and do an analysis of the drawings, it is a complex drawing.  Other people take weeks.  I cannot comment on that but one can argue the fact that Mr Mlambo should have been taken more seriously and I have already acknowledged that, Chair, I do not want to go back on that argument.  But I can only say and I say it with a fair amount of shame, but I was convinced that it was the right thing to do at the time, I was convinced that we had an agreement, I wanted to honour that agreement and I was pushing for the work to be done there because I knew it would come out to be the correct configuration.  So, yes.     My apology, Chair, I did not hear.  My answer…?     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Correct, Chair.     Yes, Chair, when I read his comment, my deduction was both the – well, not DVS but LMT for sure, would in all probability want to do the work.  So they would say – they were not supply proof, I cannot meet the requirements, they would say let me work out a quotation, let me speak to my engineers how quickly we can do that, let us see what the processes are, we will come back to you with an answer.  That is what I read when I read this, I did not expect LMT to write back, sorry, we cannot make it.     Not – in my mind, this would have protracted the whole thing.  I took this to Mr Ntshepe and said what must we do, with his background in marketing he knew about the urgency and ...[intervenes]      I would guess ...[intervenes]      A week I would guess.    Sorry Chair, no this has got nothing to do with Badger or the Hoefyster Programme.      This was – there was a deadline for a demonstration in a client’s country.     And we had to prepare a gun to – and usually in a client’s country there is a specific, a very, very specific time slot when demonstrations or evaluations, not demonstrations, evaluations are held and it is usually to summer temperature and ranges are available and the time scale on this invoice it is clean to we had to still build the gun, test the gun and ship the gun, so there was really huge diversion on this specific programme.  If it was Hoefyster I accept your argument but this was not.     Chair I cannot – the deadline for one thing wasn’t the urgency, there was say a month later or I cannot recall, but there was a month or two months later the gun had to be, we actually didn’t ship it because of the ...[indistinct], we flew it to the country because of the urgency so there was an overall time pressure to make this happen.  On top of that I can recall that after we received the components and we tested the gun there was a problem in the ammunition feeder for this gun, so then we had to rectify that and there were extreme pressures.     Correct Chair.     Chair we almost didn’t make it and the reason was not because of the late placement of this particular item, what happened was we received all the items, we assembled the gun, we took it down to the gate to get it tested and it didn’t function properly, and we had to redo certain things.  So there was and it almost didn’t work, and we almost didn’t make the ship or the flight for this, but at the time you could have argued but in your schedule maybe there is a week to sort this in and I would have conceded to you yes you are correct Chair there is that week, we could have done that.     But in hindsight in this case it didn’t affect that there was a functioning problem, it was a good thing that we didn’t waste time, so – but I cannot say a week would have worked or wouldn’t have worked, I just remember very strongly the time pressure   Yes.     Chair I never saw it like that, I cannot recall any retrospective request for approval of a single source agreement, that I facilitated.     Sorry Chair, I remember about the conflict between the single source agreement and ...[intervenes]     Correct.     Yes, Chair but in the placement of a specific order, that was my understanding.     Ja, I do not recall this as being a general paper and I haven’t studied it enough, I see it now again, but yes because it was a conflict, I remember that there was conflict between the MOA and the procurement policy.     672?      Correct Chair.     It is correct Chair but I thought this was driven by a specific requirement and not a generalistic discussion.   I confirm to all of this but I just – I was under the impression it was driven a specific requirement which is not defined.     Thank you Chair.

BURGER: On discussions we had in executive committee meetings where it was stated that people may sometimes make too bit an issue of the PFMA and that it is not so rigid as what certain companies or divisions might think it should be and that there is a – there is room for decision making within the PFMA.  I – it is just a comment I made.   No, Chair, I am very sure, the …[intervenes]
