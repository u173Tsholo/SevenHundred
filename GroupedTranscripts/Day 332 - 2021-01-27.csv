CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Yes. Good morning Mr Moerane.    Yes.  You wish to say something about the proceedings yesterday?    Yes.    Ja we certainly did not hear you.    And we assume you …    We – I assumed you might have left.    Yes.    No, no thank you very much.  Thank you.    Yes.    Okay, no, no that is fine.  Well I am – although I said you might have left it was not – I did not think that you would leave without permission.  I actually thought there might have been…    Just technical.    Yes.  Yes.  So – but thank you for making yourself available just to set the record straight and of course you have confirmed that you did not intend to re-examine Mr Jafta.      Yes.  Thank you very much.  And for purposes of today do you wish to be excused or are you going to be with us?    Oh okay.    Oh okay.    Okay no.  So you are with us for the whole week?    Ja.    Ja okay no that is alright.  Okay we are going to adjourn and then for a brief period and then resume but I see Counsel there is Counsel who wants to say something.    Yes.    Sorry.    Yes.    Yes.  UNKNOWN    No thank you Counsel.  It is a legitimate for you and your client to raise the matter.  Mr Pretorius do you want to say something now?    Or later?    Okay alright we will take an adjournment it is twenty five past. It may well be that the logistical arrangements are about to be ready maybe it will be ten minutes adjournment.    But it should…    Yes.  Yes.    Okay we will adjourn for ten minutes.  We adjourn.     Yes, Mr Pretorius.  I see my registrar has not put any file here.     Yes, Mr Pretorius.     So the fact of the matter is that – or the grounds for the order are, one, because of her status as employed by SSA.     Two, that there have been acts of intimidation relating to people working with her or something like that?     The investigation in which she is involved.  Okay alright.  I see there is counsel who wants to say something.     Is it all of your clients who are opposing it?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     H’m?     Would you complain as a soccer fan that the substitute should be wearing his own jersey, not the other player’s jersey? UNKNOWN     [laughs]       [laughs]       Well, the first order that is asked for in the order that has been applied for, asks me to condone the fact that no notice is given to implicated parties.  So in other words, there is a clear understanding that, on the part of the Legal team, that the norm is to give notice to implicated parties but in this particular case, it is submitted that the circumstances justify not given notice to implicated persons and that would be dealt with – that would have been dealt with in the affidavit.     And of course, you know that there cases even in court where a party who brings an application may be justified in not giving notice and has to ask the court to condone that failure.  And if the court does not condone that failure, obviously, the court insists that notice be given.     Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.     Well, I think let us deal with both now.     Since he has...  Ja.     They were served with Mr Y’s affidavit?     Ja.     So effectively, Ms Y ...[intervenes]    Now Ms Y(sic) is coming to say ...[intervenes]      Ms K.     Ms K is coming to say    That is the basis on which she is coming.     Ja, okay.       H’m, h’m.     Yes, yes.     H’m.     Yes.     Yes.  It is a matter of ...[intervenes]      It is a matter of, if two people have personal knowledge of the same events ...[intervenes]      ...and once becomes unavailable to testify, another one comes in to testify in regard to the same events.     Because she too has personal knowledge of those events.     And she would go along the lines of the affidavit that was served on the implicated parties.     Ja.     Ja.  H’m.  Okay.     Ja.     Ja.  H’m.  Then you wanted to say something about not giving notice and...     Ja.     Ja, okay.  Counsel for various parties, what do you say in response?     Mr K’s(sic) affidavit has been submitted to the Commission.     Yes.  Well...  Ja ...[intervenes]      Continue.     I think there is a confirmatory affidavit.     Yes, you see ...[intervenes]      You see, this is a matter where the implicated parties, notice is not given to implicated parties because of the nature of the application but what has happened, as Mr Pretorius indicates, you have been given Mr K’s(sic) affidavit.     Mr Y’s affidavit.  You know these alphabets, one is going to end up getting confused.  So basically, Ms Y(sic) is in substance going to say, I am making an example, when that car accident happened which Mr Y watched or saw.  I also was an eye-witness to it.   And I have read his affidavit and I am going to confirm what is in accordance with my recollection of what happened.  And it is in line to a very large extent with Mr Y’s evidence.  But where I differ or where my recollection is not the same as his, I will specify.       Well ...[intervenes]      You see ...[intervenes]      Maybe confirm is not necessarily – maybe it might be a term that might be confusing to some people.      She claims to have personal knowledge of the same matters that Mr Y deals within his affidavit and therefore she would not be giving hearsay evidence.   UNKNOWN     Ja, I am not ...[intervenes]      Ja.     I will give you – are you done or do you need more – you are done?     You are done.  Thank you.  I heard that there might be somebody else.       Ja.     Yes.     Well, I was clarifying that maybe confirm is not the right word because she has personal knowledge, as I understand it, of the same events.     You will be given an opportunity after to respond to her affidavit or to apply for leave to cross-examine her.  That is what has happened in matters such as this where this kind of application is done and a number of them have been brought and granted on that basis.   The – you would – you may have noticed from the media sometime back that there were witnesses who gave – there were witnesses connected with Transnet who gave evidence from secret location dealing with evidence about certain people that they said had – were collecting bags of money from the Gupta residence.  The same thing was done.   The same thing has been done with other witnesses who have given evidence from a secret location.  You get – the implicated persons get the ...[indistinct] after to refute the evidence.  The norm is you get the evidence before but there are exceptions.  It is just like in court, as I indicated to your colleague. The norm is if you are going to bring an application for an order against somebody, you serve the application on that person so that when you move that application in court that person is represented and is able to oppose but there are circumstances where the court departs from that, the implicated person does not get given notice and the person who brings the application asks the court to condone that for reasons that are given and, if the court is satisfied, then it gives the implicated party and opportunity  afterwards to deal with the allegations.  That is the principle. ADV     Ja, you see, you are all getting confused with something that really is either here not there.  You know, I am saying, as I understood the position, Ms K is saying in effect to a very large extent, take this affidavit by Mr Y as if it was my affidavit because I have personal knowledge of the contents of that affidavit.  I am going to come and testify about exactly those things but where my recollection or my knowledge differs from that of Mr Y, I am going to say so that, no, my recollection is different and but a lot of things that are there in that affidavit reflect my own knowledge.     Yes.  No, thank you very much.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.  It think there is another council who wants to say something?     Oh okay, alright.     Yes.     Well, what Mr Pretorius has said is that she will not go outside the affidavit of Mr Y and she will not give evidence, her own evidence insofar as it relates to matters that are not dealt with in Mr Y’s affidavit.  So in other words, when you look at Mr Y’s affidavit, that is what she will confine herself to.     As I understand the position.     Okay.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.  Well, there is another – counsel?     But there might have …[intervenes]     They might have thought he would recover in time for the hearing.     But the substance of what Ms K is going to talk about, testify about, is in Mr Y’s affidavit.  You know it.       All you have been told is …[intervenes]     All you have been told is instead of Mr Y saying these things in this affidavit, Mr Y, it will be Mr K.  The substance of what will be said about your client or whoever is there, it has been given to you, you know it.       Yes.  Well, Mr Pretorius, I think if he has not dealt with that, he will deal with that.  I think let me hear, I think there was another counsel who wanted to say something.     Thank you, thank you very much.  Registrar?  Mr Pretorius, what do you say to that?     Well, Ms K has brought an application.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes.  I am – I have heard what the various who have spoken have said, I am going to grant the application and if they wish me to furnish reasons for the decision, they may request reasons and I will provide them.     Yes, thank you.  I am satisfied that the application should be granted and insofar as any rule may not have been fully complied with, I am satisfied that in all of the circumstances CONDONATION SHOULD BE GRANTED. Now in terms of the actual order, I shall make the following order. ORDER 1.  It is recorded that this application was heard without prior notice to affected parties and failure to give notice is here condoned. 2.  Having heard argument presented by Mr Pretorius, from the head of the Commission’s legal team and having also heard counsel representing some of the parties I make the following order. 2.1 The witness is to be referred to during her evidence before the Commission and after her evidence insofar as the Commission is concerned as Ms K. 2.2 The witness’ identity shall not be disclosed or published in any manner. 2.3 The names and initials of the witness shall be redacted from all affidavits and  documentation presented in evidence. 2.4 No photograph or video or other image of the witness may be taken, published or broadcast. 2.5 No person may photograph or publish any photograph or other image of any person engaged in and/or responsible for the protection of the witness when she gives evidence. 2.6 The witness need not be present at the Commission’s hearing venue when giving evidence but she may instead give her evidence from a separate and undisclosed location (the protected witness location.) 2.7 No camera will be permitted in the protected witness location. 2.8 No person other than the Chairperson, members of the Commission’s legal team, the Commission’s safety and security advisor, those necessary to assist or protect the witness when she give evidence or another person specifically designated by the Chairperson will be permitted to enter or are permitted to enter the protected witness location unless they have prior written permission, the prior written permission of the Chairperson of the Commission. 2.9 It is recorded that the oath has been administered to the witness in front of the Chairperson. 2.10 And audio link from the protected witness location will be provided so that the witness’ evidence can be heard in the Commission’s hearing venue when such evidence is given. 2.11 Subject to the usual rules applicable to the conduct of the Commission’s proceedings, 2.11.1 members of the public, including the media, may be present in the hearing venue in such numbers as may be directed by the Chairperson. 2.11.2 Sound reaching the hearing venue via the audio link in the protected witness location may be broadcast and the proceedings in the hearing venue may be relevant and broadcast. 2.12 This order may be amended or supplemented by the Chairperson at any time if, in his opinion, that is necessary to protect the applicant or the witness or any person in connection with the applicant or the witness’ evidence or to ensure fairness to any implicated person. 2.13 In order to protect the identity of Ms K, the secretary of the Commission was authorised to sign the notice of application on her behalf. 2.14 This order shall also apply with the necessary changes required by the contents should the witness be directed to give evidence.” No, 2.14, Mr Pretorius, does not seem to be necessary.     Ja, it should not have been there, so the order goes up to 2.13.  That is the order I made.     Ja, okay.     Okay.  Thank you.     Ja, I guess maybe we should have a short adjournment so that when we start we go up to lunchtime.   Ja, let us have a 15 minutes adjournment.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS     Okay, let us continue or let us start.     By the way I just want to repeat the oath has been administered to the witness.     Sorry Mr Pretorius.     No, no hang on, is page 418 the last page of Mr Y’s affidavit?   I am not asking the witness, I am just asking Mr Pretorius.   It appears to be.       You notice what I have noticed.     Okay is page 418 the last page of Mr Y’s affidavit?     Yes, no, no you are right.   It looks like to me it may be that there is something at page 418 that shouldn’t be there, or am I mistaken?     Oh, okay.     Oh, okay, well that confuses.     Because we should either have a pseudonym that is written there at page 418 or Mr Y and not both.     Okay, I may have missed that, it is just that also I think it is better to have one, whether it is Mr Y or ...[intervenes]      To avoid confusion yes, okay alright.     Okay you may proceed.     I am sorry Mr Pretorius, well yes Ms K as you give evidence just always be alive to not saying anything that could make you identifiable, you understand.     Yes, yes, that is why Mr Pretorius says you need not mention your position.     But am I correct in understanding that the distinction you seek to make between yourself and Mr Y is that you were involved in the actual operations but he was receiving reports about those operations?     Okay, alright.     Well that is Ms K’s affidavit.     Yes, and her affidavit will be Exhibit?     The affidavit of Ms K which starts at page 340 together with its annexure which is the affidavit of Mr Y is admitted as Exhibit YY9.     Should I have Bundle 01, Mr Pretorius?     Ja, okay.     I’m trying to make sure that we are not going to do something that will be confusing. For quite some time, what we have been doing is to refer, effectively, to the file as Bundle and the documents inside as Exhibits.  Of course we have got SSA Bundle 01 on the outside on the spine which is fine but I think you have in mind that, I think it refers to Exhibit YY1.     I realise, of course, what can be done is – ja it’s …[intervenes].     Ja, maybe we should – maybe we should just refer to it as Bundle 01, SSA Bundle 01 and …[intervenes].     [Laughter].  So, what is quite clear is that, in Bundle 01 – SSA Bundle 01 there are various documents that have evidential value that are going to be used.     Exhibit YY1, ja.     Yes.     Yes, is that the Q and A and B and C, is that what you’re referring to?     Yes, I’m looking at page 2.    Ja.      Yes.     Yes, well I think, let us say, each document, I guess, has got some kind of heading that I can find it?     Yes, I wonder whether – at least those that will refer to, we can’t, as we come to them use the heading, say Exhibit YY01, that or something like that or would that still be quite cumbersome?     Yes, so…[intervenes].     Yes, so could we say that, effectively, the Exhibits – documents are all Exhibit YY01.     But they- there are different documents under YY01 and you have to identify the page where the…[intervenes].     Yes, yes okay alright.  This file then, we’ll refer to it as SSA Bundle 1 of 01 and then the documents will, for convenience, be Exhibit YY01 and each document will be referred to with reference to the pagination and the heading of the document, is that fine?     Okay, alright thank you.     From the SSA?    You are right in because what you saying is no one can dispute that – that is what it says.    That is what it says whether it is constitutional is another thing but you are talking about what it says.    I think you are right.    I interrupted you.    Oh.    Ja okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja okay.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Ms K     What you have just said does it mean that you are saying you are not in a position to say the entire CDSO fell outside the lawful mandate of SSA but you are saying you are confining yourself to those operations of CDSO that Project Veza has been investigating.    Okay alright.    Mr Pretorius make it clear your question may be in understood as if you are inviting her to – to include those who might not be mentioned in the paragraph that she knows to have played a critical role.  I do not think that is what you intend.    Yes.    In other words Ms K as I understand it what Mr Pretorius is saying is that he notes that you have already said that you are in – you are largely in agreement with what Mr Y says in paragraph 3.13 and he notes that you have said there are other names that are not mentioned. 1.  He wants you to confine you to the names that are mentioned but I think he wants you to mention only the names in respect of whom you have personal knowledge of their involvement.  But only the names – only names that are in the paragraph.  He does not want you to introduce names that are not in the paragraph.    But you mention those in respect of whom you have personal knowledge of their involvement by virtue of the information you obtained through the investigations that you are busy with it.  Mr Pretorius did I capture correctly?    Oh okay.  Okay let me repeat.     As I understand it Mr Pretorius notes that you say there are certain names which are not included in paragraph 3.13 that you think may be…    Oh.  Okay.  I think I will have to bring my microphone closer.  Can you hear me well now?    Okay. 1.  I think he does not want you to mention any names that are not in paragraph 3.13.  You understand that?    Even though you may think that those other names.    Which are not here also played a role.  Okay.  That will be dealt with some other time.    You confine yourself when you mention the names in paragraph 3.13 you confined yourself to those names that you have personal knowledge of as people who were involved.    In these things based on your involvement in the Veza investigation.  You understand ?    Okay alright.  You can then continue.    Maybe – yes – yes read the paragraph insofar as what you are able to confirm.  Okay.    Read it ja.    Yes we will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock.      We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.     Thank you.     I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  You are at 4.7?  Is that where you are?     Well, just to make sure which – what Ms K confirms and what she does not confirm.  Let me do this.  You see the first sentence in paragraph 4.7 Ms K?  Do you see the first ...[intervenes]      It says    Okay alright.  And then there is    Otherwise, you can confirm the rest of that sentence.     Okay.  Mr Pretorius, do you want to proceed from there?     Well, I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  It seems to me that whatever their duties were, they did not perform them within SSA’s structures, at least initially.  They seemed to have performed their duties, whatever their duties were, outside of SSA.  If...  Does that help you understand what it means?     Ms K?     Oh, is the position that, as far as you know, the manner in which they performed their duties, whatever their duties were, was the same throughout the period you are aware of them performing duties?  There would be initially and then maybe later it is different?     Yes.  You know them to have been doing whatever their duties were ...[intervenes]      ...in the same way throughout that you were aware of, of them?     Okay.  Do you – are you aware of only way in which they were performing their duties, whatever their duties were?  In other words, you are not in a position to say initially this is how they performed their duties and later they performed them differently?     Yes.     Ja.  Okay alright.  Insofar as there is a reference in 4.8.6 to them performing duties outside formal SSA structures.  You have said that they would go to provinces and I am just trying to understand that because you did say something even though you say you would rather not comment.   Would the position be that, as far as you understand the position, they would use the infrastructure of SSA for performing their duties for whenever they needed to but they themselves were not part of any formal structure at SSA?  Are you able ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes.     H’m.     Yes.     Yes, but do you know whether whenever, for example, they were in a particular province they would go to the SSA offices in that province and make use of the facilities there?     You do not know?     Okay alright.     But other than 4.8.6.  Are you in agreement with the rest of that summary, starting from 4.8.1 to 4.8.6 that Mr Pretorius gave earlier?     Okay.  4.8.4 you are not in agreement with or you are not sure about it or you are sure?     Okay alright.  Okay.  So you are in agreement with 4.8.1, 4.8.2, 4.8.3 and 4.8.5.     You are not sure about 4.8.6 and 4.8.4.     Ja, okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.     Before you do that Mr Pretorius.  To the extent that Mr Y’s affidavit may have references to File 1, File 2, File 3.  Because I think you said that you put those into one file.  It might be a good idea that in the one file that you put all of that in, there should be sections which can represent what is – what was in File 1 as he knew it and what was in File 2.   So that one can then say into the record when he refers to File 1 that will be section so and so in this bundle and so on.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, ja.     I am sorry.  What page on...?     Oh, page 6.     Okay.  Thank you.  Ja, I have got it.     Before you proceed, Mr Pretorius, just for the transcribers, in reading paragraph 4.12 Mr Pretorius indicated that before the word realigning you opened quotes but you forgot to mention where you closed quotes, the quotes would be closed after the two words counter intelligence. Ja, that is fine, that is just for the transcribers.     Let us continue.     In other words …[intervenes]     In other words, it is the last sentence of paragraph 4.1 to that you are not able to associate yourself with.     Ja, okay.     Just to make sure I understand what you agree with and what you do not agree with on 4.13, Ms K.  As I understand it, the first sentence which is three lines, simply says what was in the motivation.  It says the general motivation that was given for the centralising of these key assets within counter intelligence was explained     Okay, that seems – what you have just said seems to suggest that you might not be sure with regard to the first sentence but you are quite comfortable that the second sentence is true, is correct.     Yes, yes.     Okay, okay.  No, that is fine then.  Yes, Mr Pretorius?     Mr Pretorius will you remember to arrange for Mr Y to do a supplementary to just correct that?     It should be read to say Dorothy.     Yes.     Ja.    Mr Y deals in some detail.     Well, I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Well, maybe let us take this opportunity for me to get clarity because there are two Dlomos here.  I have seen a reference to Ambassador Dlomo and then there is – I think there is Thulani Dlomo and Dennis Dlomo.   Now, Ms K you say provided the understanding is that this reference to Ambassador Dlomo is a reference to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo.  I am wondering whether they were both referred to as ambassadors or were ambassadors both of them at some stage.  Is there only one of them who was an Ambassador?     They were both Ambassadors at some stage?     Oh, which means, therefore, in the affidavit wherever there is Ambassador Dlomo without a reference to the name it might create difficulties unless the context indicates which one, such as if one was …[intervenes]     If only a particular one was associated with DSO, CDSO, then if that is the context then we would know that is the one who was associated with that operation.     Yes.  Okay.     Oh, okay, so for purposes of Mr Y’s affidavit, where there is refer to Ambassador Dlomo you are referring to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo.  Ms K?     Yes, okay.  Okay, it is just that it is important because serious allegations are made so one does not want to understand certain allegations to be attached to somebody that was not intended.  So it is important to understand who is being referred to in regard to what allegations.  Okay, Mr Pretorius?     Well, I am sorry, Mr Pretorius, we have got to always make sure we know what she agrees to.  You have read paragraph 5.4 Ms K, have you not?     Oh, was that not the one you were talking about?     Yes, ja, okay.  You see, I thought we were already at 5.4  Okay, alright.  I think that the way that you have been doing it, Mr Pretorius is good to actually read so that she is able to say that is what I am not agreeing to, that is what …[intervenes]     Yes, no, no, that is fine, ja.     Ja.     Well you can only agree with the statement if you have seen the presidential handbook and you have seen that that is what it does.     Okay.     Okay, no that is fine, that is good enough.      Thank you.     Well, I also wanted to say exactly the same thing, Ms K that Mr Pretorius was not criticising you he was actually meaning to say, you are being cautious and that is a good thing.  So that that which you confirm, everyone will know you confirmed because you believe you have knowledge of that and there are proper grounds and when you are not sure you make it clear that you are not sure and therefore you are not going to confirm something that you are not sure about.  That might not mean you saying it is not true.  It might simply mean that you are not in a position to say whether it is true or not and obviously when you say it, it is where your understanding is that it is not true, you must feel free to say this part is not true or as far as I know the position is different and as far as I know, this is the position. So that is good it is not a bad thing.    One second Mr Pretorius.  I think Counsel for SSA has something to say.    What paragraph?    5.9?    Ja.    Ja.    It is CDSO.    Oh Toxicology.     So you ask whether it relates to the Toxicology Unit only?    I thought it would have been clear that it is the unit but I may have misunderstood.  Mr Pretorius.    Thank you.    Ja I think what – I think what Ms K – Ms K.    Ms K.  Ms K.  I think what Ms K was saying previously Mr Pretorius she seemed to be saying as far as the guarding of the Presidential aircraft is concerned one cannot say that this unit was removing or interfering with the mandate of the SAPS because that is as far as she knows supposed to be within the mandate of SANDF.  I think that is the only qualification she sought to make.  So if I am correct in understanding her in that way she sought to say insofar as this unit sought to guard the Presidential aircraft they may have been or they were encroaching of SANDF’s mandate but in terms of the rest they were encroaching on SAPS mandate.    Ms K is that correct?    Ms K is my understanding correct of your evidence?    Okay clarify further.    No that is fine, that is fine.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius I just want to clear this.  Is it correct Ms K that all your knowledge in regard to these – these matters that you are sharing with the commission is based on what you found during the investigations either by way of documentation or what you were told by people that you interviewed in the course of conducting the Project Veza investigation?    Yes.  So that the – the – there would not – you would not have personal knowledge – you would not have personally witnessed the events as they occurred as such that your investigations – your investigation that is Project Veza investigation re – may have revealed evidence that certain events or certain things did happen.    Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    Oh I think what Mr Pretorius is saying is you do personally know certain people within the SSA that we are talking about here.    You will know that.    Yes people that you know as having been at SSA at a particular time.    Yes.    Okay alright.    Hang on let us take an adjournment. I see it is four o’clock and let us talk about how far we will go.  I am prepared to sit longer.  What is your – how does the plan look like in terms of tomorrow and …;    Yes.    But we should do as much as we can I would imagine.    Ja.    No you are standing and I am seated.    Yes.  So – so in terms of Ms K giving evidence – her evidence spilling over to tomorrow in terms of the legal team did that fit within the plan or?    Oh she is not pushing out a witness.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine particularly if the plan for tomorrow was – it is not like there is a witness who will be pushed out.    Oh okay no that is fine.  Well I think then I would be guided by your assessment even whether we should go up to five.    Yes and then ja and then continue tomorrow.    Continues – start at ten tomorrow?    We start at ten.  Okay no that is fine.  Maybe we should do that then – what I am – what I am not sure about and do you think we would finish tomorrow because I am looking at how much we have covered in terms of Mr Y’s affidavit. We have done 25 of 80 pages.  Unless that suggests we might not reach.    Ja.    Oh okay.    Okay.  Okay.  No that is fine.  So Ms K you are following the discussion?    Yes you have no problem?    Okay I think we will then adjourn now and then we resume tomorrow at ten o’clock.    So you - you will come back to your place from where you are giving evidence tomorrow at ten Ms K.    Okay.  We – we are going to adjourn then until tomorrow at ten.  We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair.  Chair in relation to the next witness there is first an application to be brought and in relation to the next witness certain logistical arrangements need to be made about the venue from which she will testify which is a secret location or an undisclosed location rather.  So until those arrangements have been finalised which should be very shortly may we take a short adjournment?   We also have Advocate Moerane who is on line who wishes to just make a brief statement in relation to yesterday’s evidence and his client Mr Jafta.    Well…    If we had been afforded the courtesy in advance of what my learned friend was going to say including the serious accusations he makes one would have thought that it is proper that we be given notice of what he has to say. We will look at it and we will respond in due course. But Mr Fraser ’s rights are protected by the fact that he can make any application he wishes to you in a formal sense and should he be in a position where he needs more time or more consideration before he brings an application to cross-examine which he may do to give his own evidence which he may do he can rectify the situation.  Insofar and I do not make no concessions at this stage insofar as there is a legitimate complaint.  He has his remedies. But only in fairness as Mr Fraser ’s representative seems to insist on yes we should be given notice of these matters so we can deal with them properly.  Thank you.    Yes.    It should not be longer than that I will check now.    Thank you.     Chair, can I just respond please?     Correspondence that has been addressed to the Commission has been responded to, there have been engagements but the evidence of a witness, the circumstances under which a witness gives evidence is not a matter of negotiation between that witness, that witness of representatives and the legal team, these matters are for you to decide, evidence will be properly be placed before you and they can respond.       Quite frankly, the notion that we must negotiate, whether a witness gives evidence and the conditions under which a witness gives evidence and what the witness can and cannot say is just nonsense, Chair.     As soon as Mr Y recovers, I do not know if my learned friend heard, Mr Y has recently emerged from a coma, he is seriously indisposed.     It is nothing that I can give any guarantee about.  And my empathy goes towards Mr Y.  He will come, if there is space on the calendar, and he will come if you decide, Chair.     So the matter in your hands.       I might just add it might help my learned friends that indeed Ms K has prepared an affidavit, which will be put before you, annexing Mr K’s (sic) affidavit.  To the extent that she cannot confirm what Mr Y says, she will say so.     Well, Chair, in the first place, it seems that the intention to preclude Ms K from giving evidence in camera should not be confused with the intention to prevent her evidence at all.  Quite simply, the Commission must hear the evidence, in our submission, it is important evidence.  But in relation to the application for protected identity, the rules make it clear and , as all rules, they are there for the convenience of the court, or the Commission, not in order to obstruct due process and to prohibit the Commission from doing its work. I make no sense for my learned friends to insist that an application to give evidence in camera or an application to give evidence under conditions of protected identity should not itself be brought under the same terms.   What my learned friends are asking for is an application in the name of the witness concerned giving full details of the witness concerned so that they contest it.  One cannot conceal the name, so you have given an order that that is so and that is what we have asked you to do.  It is perfectly logical, it is within this practice and it is perfectly within ordinary practice to do that.    And she brought the application long ago, Chair, before you.     As did Mr Y.     Yes, it does not apply, Chair.     Yes, 2.14 was only there should the Commission revert to virtual hearings.     Thank you, Chair.     I am not sure what the Chair wants to do about the short adjournment or should we just proceed?     Yes, Chair.     Thank you Chair.  Ms K can you hear us?     Thank you.   Ms K would you look at the bundle before you ...[intervenes]      Yes, you confirm that Ms K that you have taken the oath?     Thank you.   Ms K would you please look at the bundle before you marked SSA Bundle 02?     And go to the divider YY9.     If you go to page 340 and we are referring to the black numbers in the top left hand corner you will see an affidavit.     So YY9.     The last divider in that file.     Do you have it?     Alright, please go to page 340.      You see there the affidavit of Ms K?      And if you go to page 341 the signature has been removed but this oath was taken or not the oath rather the affidavit was attested to on the 26 t h of January 2021.  Is that right?     This is your affidavit?     And annexed to your affidavit as Annexure K1 is the affidavit of Mr Y, do you see that?     And if you go to page 418  you will see that that affidavit was attested to on the 30 t h of November 2020.     Thank you.   Just by way of background Ms K you and Mr Y, amongst others, are employed by the SSA and are involved in the conduct of investigations or an investigation?     Sorry, do you want to admit ...[intervenes]      Sorry.     I am getting advice.  I am receiving advice from several quarters, I am distracted.     419 is the last page which is the signature of the Commissioner.     That is a pseudonym.    It is a pseudonym that has been placed across all affidavit by the investigator, it is a pseudonym in addition to Mr Y.     Yes, it does and we will correct that Chair.    Correct.   You are absolutely correct, we will correct that Chair but if one goes to page 343 you will see that the pseudonym says “also known as Mr Y”, so pseudonym A also known as pseudonym B, it is very complicated but it is there and we can tidy it up.    No you are quite correct Chair, we will stick to Mr Y.     Yes, this world is confusing enough as it is.       Yes.  Ms K are you there?     Both you and Mr Y have been involved in Project Veza, is that correct?     And you have worked together for a period of time in the course of that investigation?     Yes, please do.     Right, you worked together with him on the project, in other words he was the sponsor of the project on which you worked?     Alright, you need not refer to your position.     Okay.     Yes, Ms K I am trying to put the propositions to you in general terms so that the precise nature of your position is not disclosed, which would make it easier to identify you so if you would just bear with me.     Let’s put it this way, both you and Mr Y have had continuous interactions in relation to the work of Project Veza?     And you have shared knowledge.        You have shared knowledge concerning the activities of the project, correct?     And as we go through his affidavit, which is annexed to your affidavit where you don’t know or have no knowledge of what he says you will tell the Chair, is that correct?     So when you deal with or attest to what Mr K or Mr Y rather says in his affidavit you will have your own personal knowledge of that fact, correct?     And given the proceedings of the last three days and the nature of the evidence you were giving, a sensitive nature, may I ask you please to be very cautious not to implicate any person other than those who are mentioned in the affidavit of Mr Y.  There will be times when you will give your own comments, but provided you do not implicate any person other than those implicated in the affidavit of Mr Y that would be in order.     Thank you. Chair may we admit Exhibit YY8, sorry YY9 into the record.     And annexed to Ms K’s affidavit is Mr Y’s affidavit and it forms part of that affidavit for that reason.     YY9.     Then Ms K you have before you another bundle of documents.  It is called SSA Bundle 01, do you see that?     You will testify in due course as I understand it that the Commission issued a request for information to the State Security Agency for certain information and documentation, three lever arch files were provided to the Commission pursuant to that RFI, the request for information, that – those three bundles, rather contained documents and information which had been declassified by the Director General, the Acting Director General, is that correct?     For convenience sake we’ve compiled a single bundle comprising those three lever arch files and that’s marked Bundle 01 Exhibit YY1.     These are documents which are relevant to the investigatory work that project Veza have done, am I correct?     Yes, the document comprises – if you will bear with me one moment, some 886 pages, Chair, I ask that, that be admitted.     As Exhibit YY1, it’s the reference bundle.     Yes, Chair, otherwise we would have 886 separate…[intervenes].     If it assists, Chair, we can refer to it as Bundle 01.     Also known as Exhibit YY1?     Yes, Chair.     Chair, if one looks inside the Bundle 01, you’ll see an index.     So, the documents or groups of documents to which we will refer each has its own marking.     It’s on page 2.     It’s marked, Index.     The various documents under – are grouped under heading 1 and then from heading 2, 3, 4 and 5, documents relating to particular projects are listed.      We won’t be referring to all of them but some of them.     Yes, Chair, we will guide you through as we go through.     Ja, for record keeping purposes, it’s probably better that the documentation be collated under one heading and then we refer to page numbers, for reference purposes that will be much easier than going through the Bundle looking for a particular heading.     So the sequence of pages is important.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, the page and a description of the document.     Yes, Chair, thank you.     Ms K, can I take you to the affidavit of Mr Y and just for clarity sake you will tell the Chair what you, of your own personal knowledge can testify to in relation to what Mr Y has said in his affidavit, correct?     And where you cannot, from your own personal knowledge testify to what Mr Y has said in his affidavit you will alert the Chair to that fact, correct?     You do have added information which may implicate other people but that information you won’t present today or tomorrow, that information will be presented in due course in a separate affidavit, correct?     Thank you.  If you would then, go please, to paragraph 2.1 under the heading, “Co-operation with the Commission”.     Do you have knowledge of the fact that the SSA and in particular the Director General received a request for information from the Commission?     Yes, and can you confirm that in that request for information the SSA was asked to provide information with regard to the SSA’s investigation into irregularities within the Chief Directorate Special Operations?     And do you know, to your own knowledge, that a number of reports, presentations, assessments, in fact a number of documents were handed over to the Commission in response to this request for information?     Do you also have knowledge of a summons being issued by the Commission dated the 26 t h of August , requesting certain materials from the Commission?     From the SSA by the Commission, correct Chair, thank you and do you know that further materials were produced in response to that summons?     And subsequently, further request for information – request for information were issued by the Commission to the SSA and they were responded to?     In paragraph 2.4 there’s an assertion by Mr Y about where these documents, relevant to your investigation were found, do you know that they were found during an inspection in a walk-in safe at the SSA?     This doesn’t implicate anyone so I want to ask you.  Were those documents lodged there, in the normal course of administration?     Alright, you needn’t go further.     You needn’t go any further in regard to that, there will be further evidence if it’s necessary but what I do want to ask you is, the documentation provided to the Commission in response to the requests for information and summons were handed over and then during a long process were declassified for the purposes of making them public, is that correct?     And those are the documents contained in the bundle that the Chair and I have just been discussing, Exhibit YY01, Bundle 01, is that correct, that Bundle before you?     Paragraph 2.6, Mr Y says that the documentation provided to the Commission was also handed over to the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation on 10 June 2019, do you have knowledge of that?     It was also handed over to the Investigating Directorate ID on the 15 t h of October 2020, correct?     And this was done pursuant to two inquiries opened by the SSA on 10 April 2019 in terms of the Prevention and Combating Corrupt Activities Act, is that correct, do you have knowledge of that?     Right, now in paragraph 2.7 the origins of Project Veza are described. In paragraph 2.7 reference is made to an internal investigation of the SSA, I presume, called Project Momentum, do you know of that?     That project was initiated as an investigation, an internal investigation to address allegations of corruption within the SSA, is that correct, do you know that?     Right and we are told that limited progress was made in that investigation because of challenges experienced in relation to access to information, is that also, within your knowledge?     The investigation, the affidavit continues, was therefore re-enforced and re-launched by the Acting DG, Loyiso Jafta on 5 December 2018 under the name Project Veza.     You confirm that, do you?     Right, and the mandate of Project Veza is described in paragraph 2.8, the investigation team was tasked with investigating irregularities and criminality arising from the contravention of the SSA’s governance, operational and financial prescripts during the period 2012 to 2018, do you know that?     Right, the affidavit continues to say that the investigation has focused on various units with the SSA, chiefly the projects carried out by the CDSO, that’s the Chief Directorate Special Operations which is defined earlier, as the covert operational structure within the SSA but also the cover support unit and operations run from the office of the DG.  Do you know that and can you…    Alright.  The method or methodology adopted by Project Veza is described in paragraph 2.9 as multiphased, multidisciplinary.  I presume that means in other words an all-encompassing approach to the investigation, is that correct?    And its vision is to assist or to attain a sustained institutionalised keen governance culture within the SSA, do you know that?    Right. Mr Y deals with his own experience there but I presume you know him to be a person of experience within SSA?    He says in paragraph 2.10 that he – that is Mr Y is giving the evidence contained in this affidavit on behalf of the Project Veza investigation team.  You were aware of that I presume?    It continues to say   Alright.    We need not mention any names at this stage.   “It should further be noted that several individuals including implicated persons who have been assisting our investigation team have also been intimidated.” You have knowledge of that whether direct or indirect?    Right.  And finally, the statement is made in paragraph 2.10 to the effect that there have been attempts to interfere with and even sabotage the Project Veza investigation.  Do you have knowledge of that allegation?    Really.  Alright.  Perhaps we can put the detail of that in a supplementary affidavit and deal with persons involved in that regard.  If we can move onto paragraph 2.11 please.    The statement is made that this affidavit that is the affidavit of Mr Y deals with the creation and unlawful operations of a parallel intelligence structure within the SSA and the financial irregularities that accompanied it during the period 2012 to 2018.  Do you know that?     “However some of the activities the affidavit continues reflect a continuation of the irregularities that accompanied the implementation of the principle agent network Pan Program during the period 2007 to 2010.  Both the Pan and Project Veza investigations uncovered the unlawful use of parallel intelligence structures to bypass internal controls and avoid accountability for gross financial irregularities and abuses of SSA resources for improper purposes.” You will testify to those issues in detail but at a general level are you comfortable to assert that as being within your own knowledge?    Thank you.  Paragraph 2.12 deals with the structure of the affidavit and that is a convenient summary of the contents for the reader of the affidavit.  We will be covering all those topics so we can go through to the introduction over the page paragraph 3.    For the sake of completeness and to place the evidence that is given in this affidavit and that will be given by yourself into its proper context you have set out and Mr Y has set out in this affidavit certain constitutional principles.      And I would just like to highlight them in summary for the sake of context and completeness.  Paragraph 3.1.1 refers to Section 198(C) of the Constitution which stipulates that National Security must be pursued in compliance with the law including international law.  I will go on because no one can contest that this is what the    Paragraph 3.2 sets out   And then reference is made in paragraph 3.4 to the Counter Intelligence Mandate but we need not go there that is part of legislation which no one can dispute.  The – well provided it is constitutional of course I must correct myself.  If we can go to the following page?    Yes.    Yes correct.    Yes.      Yes.  Whether it binds the SSA of course.    Might have – but perhaps we need not deal with those subtleties at least at this stage.    But we have to.    Given the events of the past week.    And in fact Chair to be serious there is a contention which may be raised in submissions that there may be some contradictions or conflicts between the 13 amendments to the Intelligence Services Act and the Constitution.    But that is a matter for later consideration.    If we can go over the page please Ms K to paragraph 3.5 which deals with the which deals with the…    The organisational and governance structure of the SSA and the point is made that political responsibility for the SSA lies with the duly designated Minister of State Security and the governance structure of the SSA falls under the leadership of the Director General in this case the acting Director General.  Correct?    Then certain comments are made in paragraph 3.6 and I do not think we need to deal with it today in relation to the role of the Minister of State Security but they are there for the record and I do not wish to ask you to comment on that.  In paragraph 3.7 there are some internal documents some of which remain classified some of which we have.  There are the MPD’s that is the Ministerial Delegations of Powers and Direction of Payment.  Is that correct?    And several operational deceptives referred to in paragraph 3.7.2.      Yes.  So…    So do I understand correctly that the activities of the SSA are governed in detail by various regulatory instruments which may be termed internal instruments, is that correct?    Right.  Let us go on to make some high level observations if we may in relation to the evidence that has been collected by the Project Veza investigation team.  Now as I understand the position from what you have told us Ms K that you in particular have working knowledge and direct knowledge of the evidence documentary and otherwise gathered by the investigation team.  Is that correct?    That you as a member of the investigation team; the Veza investigation team have knowledge of the evidence collected by the investigation team; the documentary evidence and other evidence that the team has collected.  Is that correct?    Right.  And the conclusion is drawn by Mr Y in paragraph 3.8 that the team has established or it has been revealed to the team that the operations run by the Chief Directorate Special Operations fell outside the lawful mandate of the SSA.  Did not follow prescribed procedures and totally ignored the applicable governance, financial and operational directives of the SSA.  That is a comment at a high level – it is generalised and perhaps it is absolute but can you attest to that yourself or do you wish to qualify it in any way?  And by qualify I mean…    Right.  And then in 3.9 it is stated…    Thank you.  Then paragraph 3.9    And it continues to say   It continues to say   Paragraph 3.11 makes a further    Yes.  You speaking to evidence which has been before in documentary or by way of in documentary form or by way of oral evidence of which you have into that degree direct knowledge, am I correct?    Insofar as the matters you have just spoken now form part of a project which we will deal with later.  We will deal with it later will we?    Thank you.  3. – the remainder of 3.11 and 3.12 are matters that we can deal with from a legal    Yes.    Right and then paragraph 3.12 talks of three categories of person covered by your projects investigation or the Project Veza investigation that is the initiators, persons who conceive and direct illicit or illegal operations and we will deal with those in the documentation in due course.  Facilitators’ persons who execute those operations under the direction of superiors and primary and secondary beneficiaries that may fall into various categories.  That is an analytical statement I am not sure that it requires any comment but if you have any comment or wish to confirm it you may.    Right.  And we will deal with that in detail when we deal with the evidence regarding the various projects.  Do I understand you correctly?    Alright.  If you would look at paragraph 3.13 and you would bear with me a moment please.  If you would look at the names in that paragraph and before we put that paragraph on record just say whether you know.    That the allegation regarding that individual is a fair allegation or correct allegation from the knowledge that you have not what Mr Y has in the course of your – obtained in the course of your investigations.  Just have a look there and then just read out the contents of paragraph 3.13 if you would to the extent that you can confirm it?    Alright well just name those that played a critical role in the matters that you investigated and not others that you do not feel sure about.    It is not what I intend at all Chair.    And perhaps I should clarify and repeat as Ms K wants me to do.  Do you see there in paragraph 3.13 a number of names are recorded?  Please just mention the names that you from your own knowledge are satisfied played a critical or important role in the matters investigated by Project Veza?    Yes.    Yes so Ms K do you follow what I have tried to convey and what the Chair has conveyed?    Yes could you mention those names please that you are satisfied played a role or were involved in matters investigated by Project Veza?    Right thank you.  Chair it is one minute to one about to start a new topic would this be a convenient time?    Thank you Chair.     And do you agree with them insofar as they are conclusions drawn?     Yes.     Alright.     Right.     Yes, thank you, Chair.     So one could draw one’s own conclusions from the facts there.  You do not take any issue with the facts continued in paragraph 4.12 as opposed to the conclusion …[intervenes]     Thank you.     Let me understand what you are saying.  Are you saying that there was no significant concentration of power as far as you are concerned or that you are not sure that you could agree with the way it is described here?     Okay, thank you.  4.13 reads    To be complete, he did say or does     Do you agree with that?     Thank you, Chair.  If we go then to 4.14 where the reason advanced is quoted in that paragraph.     If you look at paragraph 14, 4.1.14?     Right.  There the deponent, Mr Y, talks about the reason advanced for the relocation of the CDSO.  Do you see that?     And it merely quotes the motivating document.  Are you happy with that?     You agree with that.     They merely quote it from the document.  And then paragraph 4.15 deals with the proposed relocation of the cover support unit and its explanation on the basis set out there to provide backstopping.  What is backstopping?     Right.  The affidavit continues. “Although in theory the CDSO, as a legitimate deep cover operational arm of the agency, would benefit from a close working relationship with the cover support unit, the deployment of close protection officers does not require backstopping.” Do you agree with that observation?     Yes.  Continue    It follows or rather, what follows is     Right.  4.16 continues to make certain observations in relation to the recommendation that we are dealing with and refers to the justification given for the establishment of the presidential security support.  That is a matter of fact, those quote are there in the motivation or the recommendation document but halfway    Right, what are those?        Yes.     In any event, the comments made after word “significantly” to the end of the paragraph are largely factual, do you agree with them?     The last sentence reads    Yes.  Then 4.17 describes how the document that we are considering, described the recruitment and appointment of 20 officers.  The last     Yes.  The next comment is relevant     The 4.19     “Dorothy played a key role in the implementation of the structural changes.  In February 2012 she was seconded from Mr Noosi’s office to assist     And then …[intervenes]     Yes, will do.     Yes.  The word Dorothy should be inserted where appropriate.     I will not mention the name it should replace.     Anyway, that person, and I am not going to mention, Ms K, the appointment in 2013 referred     Thank you.  4.20    Alright. “The effect of this proposal, which was compiled by Dorothy was that all three units, the Chief Directorate Special Operations, the Presidential Security Support Service and the Cover Support Unit were brought under Ambassador Dlomo’s control as General Manager Special Operations.” Is that a correct recordal of the facts?     Alright.  Now there is an observation made in paragraph 4.2.1 and I will invite your comment on that as to whether you agree with it or not. “The timeline set out above demonstrates that the restructuring within the SSA, decentralised control of counter intelligence operations under Ambassador Dlomo was a plan in the making long before he was officially appointed in January 2012.  The groundwork for this restructured and repurposed CDSO was laid by Ambassador Dlomo in 08/2009 with his recruitment and training of   the co-workers who would subsequently be deployed for the President’s projects at the SSA.” Those two sentences, do you have any comment, do you agree with them, are they reasonable?  Are you in agreement?     Thank you.  It continues, the     Alright.  It continues   Right. 4.22 – oh and you agree with it, do you?      Thank you.  4.22    Thank you.     Thank you, Ms K.  In paragraph 5 you deal in some detail …[intervenes]     Yes.     In paragraph 5, the Directorate for Presidential Security Support is dealt with in some detail by Mr Y. and let us go through it paragraph by paragraph.     5.1, the first sentence says that    It continues, the paragraph     Right.  Thank you for reminding us. ““More generally it reflects the shift…”     As I understand it, Ms K, when you refer to Ambassador Dlomo in this affidavit of Mr Y you are referring to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo, is that correct?     Alright.     The remaining sentence in paragraph 5.1 is the last sentence.  Do you have any     And then 5.2 repeats evidence that is contained earlier.  We can go to 5.3 which refers to the Presidential Handbook as does 5.4.  Do you take any issue with the fact that the Presidential Handbook sets out the extent of administrative, logistical and security in general support services to be rendered to the President, the Deputy President, their spouses and children?     Paragraph 5.3.     Yes, sorry.  5.3 on page 361 of bundle SSA02.     Quotes from the Presidential Handbook and provides, in summary, that Presidential Handbook deals in detail with the various services to be rendered to the President including security services.     And paragraph 5.4 also point out …[intervenes]     Coming to 5.4, Chair.     Ja, I was talking about 5.3 but your comments are valid in relation to those.     And given the circumstances of the nature of this evidence and its format, it is perhaps wise to go slower rather than…     Thank you.     Ms K, I hope you will bear with us, then.       The paragraph 5.3 reads    Yes sure.     And the one you did get your hands on and assume provided to the investigators, the Commission is in fact in the bundle.  It is in the legislation bundle, which you do have Chair.  So we can cross check that if necessary.  In any event, the stated objective, the     And again - whilst you may not remember the exact words I take it; you do not take issue with that we can check it.     Right, 5.4 goes further to say that the presidential handbook outlines that firstly, the responsibility for the President's medical and health care resides with the Surgeon General and the South African military and health service unit of the SANDF.  Secondly, the South African Police Service is obliged to take, and I quote “Full responsibility for the protection and security of the President and Deputy President, with the intelligence services providing regular and comprehensive security assessments.” Do you agree with those observations, are those facts real?      According to the handbook    5.5.  I am sorry did you want to add something?      “5.5 notwithstanding this clear assignment of responsibility and the existing structures rendering medical and security support services to the President, the SSA established the Directorate for Presidential Security support to perform exactly the same functions.  In terms of formal documentation, outlining the mandate of the Presidential Security support service the Directorate comprised the following functions. 5.5.1 VIP protection. 5.5.2 cyber security. 5.5.3 technical surveillance countermeasures and 5.5.4 toxicology. Is that what was contained in the formal documentation outlining the mandate of the Presidential Security support service?     Thank you if you go to paragraph     Right, well the next sentence deals     Right, the paragraph continues    Yes, the only part that you have not commented on is whether this series of arrangements was to the detriment of the effective working of the protected services of the South African Police Services.  Can you comment on that?     Right, it appears Miss K that you have been very cautious and careful to restrict your confirmation of the correctness of the affidavit of Mr Y to matters that you are reasonably certain of, is that a correct observation?     Yes, I understand.     Ms K, please do not misunderstand me I am not being critical at all, in fact quite the opposite. It does appear and it is a good thing for the evidence that has been led that you are exercising the caution that you are.  So I am not being critical at all and I trust that you will continue giving evidence in this way.      Let us not misunderstand one another.      Yes, and Ms K as the day goes on or as the day's drag on please continue along the same     Right. “Members of the unit would be deployed as advanced teams to detect any potential risk or threat to the President or Deputy President when travelling.” Is that correct, is that what you were told?      “The information if any that was generated from these trips would be channelled only to Ambassador Dlomo and not formal information management structures or structure within the SSA.” Is that a correct statement or is that what you were told?      “There is no indication that threat and risk assessments which according to the presidential handbook should have been provided by intelligence were made available to the South African Police Service or the SANDF regularly or at all.” Do you have a comment on that, is it correct?     Alright, we can leave it there,     Right, would you partially agree to the extent that there was a degree of side-lining?     Right, if we can go on the next sentence says that - and obviously refers to the     So what you are saying in relation to that sentence as I understand it that people in the unit subordinate to Ambassador Dlomo told you that they reported directly to President Zuma, am I correct?     Right and then the last sentence     Right.  The protection service is said in this sentence to be possibly performing intelligence functions, do you have to comment on that?     You have already confirmed, I am sorry, I interrupted you.  Do you have anything to add?     Thank you and the last part of that sentence as it had been trained to do, I think you have confirmed earlier that the training involved intelligence training.  Am I correct?     Let us move on then if we may to the Toxicology Unit, described in paragraph 5.9.  The first     Thank you.  Paragraph continues     “This was done in conjunction with an organisation referred to as a Foreign International Development Agency for Food Safety and Security.” Now, we have taken out the name of the country where this food and safety security Agency existed but apart from that, are you comfortable with the contents of that sentence?      “Based on our investigations - the affidavit continues, this organisation does not appear to exist in any official records.”  Can you confirm that?     Right, paragraph 5.10     “In terms of the agreement the foreign side would provide course curriculum, training equipment and installation with an overall implementation date of  January 2013.” Is that a correct statement?     “During 2012 - the affidavit continues, individuals were identified through referrals and invited to submit their curriculum vitae.  Four individuals were selected, two toxicologists and two lab assistants. The individuals were not interviewed, but were allegedly vetted and sent for polygraph examinations conducted by the foreign country before attending a three week course in their country, in other words the foreign country, in December 2012.” Is that in accordance with the knowledge that you have of this project?     Thank you, 5.11 says    Thank you and we deal with Project Khusela in more detail below, but let us continue.     Right, a vivarium, I suppose is to test poisons.  I do not know let me not speculate, it is a container that contains live animals.  Do you know that?      “There appears to have been - the affidavit continues, a double dipping of funds, as members of the Toxicology Unit reported to the Directorate for Presidential Security Support for their travelling funds, subsistence and travel allowance and accommodation costs, while funds were also paid to Project Khusela as part of the CDSO operational expenditure.” Is that a correct statement of facts?     Do I understand you correctly that operatives within that unit drew money both under the head Project Khusela and under the head Toxicology Unit?     Okay, thank you for that.      “The leader of the Toxicology Unit who was one of the trained toxicologists indicated to the investigation team that she had used her own business entity Remix which is a pseudonym which had been established in 2007 as a special purpose vehicle for receiving and dispersing operational funds from the SSA for this project.” Is that a correct statement of fact that you were told that?    Could you just...    Right.  Paragraph 5.12 reads   Yes thank you.  If we can go then to paragraph 5.13 the allegations or the statements set out in this paragraph are important so I will deal with them    So do I understand you correctly Ms K to say that there is what you termed a legitimate Toxicology Unit within the SSA and the Toxicology Unit we referring here was another unit under the CDSO.   Is that correct?    Okay.  But if one qualifies the first sentence by referring to the Toxicology Unit established under the CDSO are you comfortable with the correctness of that statement?    Okay and the second sentence?    Yes.  And although on the face of it it may seem to be a light hearted statement.  It is actually on    You deal anywhere with the budget that was allocated to this Toxicology Unit.  If not it is extra evidence and we should perhaps deal with it elsewhere.    The budget that was allocated.    To the Toxicology Unit I do not think we deal with it in – or sorry I do not think Mr Y deals with it in this affidavit.  Am I correct and it would not necessarily…    Alright so it is relevant to this point that a significant amount of money appears to have been spent on this unit.  What amount was spent?    Right.  The affidavit continues   Right.  Let us go on then to the    Right.  The affidavit – the affidavit in    Continues to read   Alright.    5.15 I will read the whole paragraph because it can be read as a single concept. “Although Ambassador.”    Well so may have I misunderstood.  I thought the question was clear that the expenditure in relation to the Toxicology Unit firstly is dealt with elsewhere in this series of documents.  But secondly was R1.8 million per month for the Toxicology Unit.  Do I understand the position correctly Ms K?    So it could have been more do I understand you to say?    Thank you.    If we may proceed then to paragraph 5.15.  You have dealt with 5.14 I understand is that correct?    5.15 reads   Right I think the paragraph is – it tends to convey that the Presidential Security Support Service encroached upon the SAPS mandate to protect the President and the project in relation to Presidential aircraft also encroached on the SAPS mandate to protect the President.  Do you read it in the same way and so is it correct?    Yes I – I understood that Chair.    Ja.    Yes.    So for that reason Chair I was going a little slower because there are a number of concepts now that are being…    Included in a single sentence so let us just try and clarify that.  I think it is clear but just for the sake the record let us just clear it up.   The aircraft protection project resided under CDIS, am I correct?    Yes.  The Presidential Security Support Service resided elsewhere Chief Directorate Special Operations, is that correct?    And it would have encroached on the SAPS mandate to render Presidential protection, is that correct?    Alright so all those propositions are wrapped up in that sentence but I think we have clarified with the assistance of Chair.    Alright that is useful to understand thank you.  So the next sentence it is reasonable to infer that this was done to deliberately remove all things related to the protection of the former President out of the realm of SAPS, SAPS and to instead place them under the control of Ambassador Dlomo in the various units under his control.  Is that a fair representation of an inference that can be drawn?    Yes so we have the facts on the one hand.  We have what you were told in the course of your investigation on the other and we have the conclusion drawn by Mr Y and your comments.  Is that a fair summary?    Alright let us go to 5.16 if we may?      Perhaps one should add to that your personal knowledge of the structures and personnel within SSA.    You also have personal knowledge of the SSA organisation it structures and the persons of the persons within the SSA, is that correct?    Right yes that was the point I was making. Perhaps should have been qualified more accurately Ms K that there are people who occupy positions within the SSA and you would have direct knowledge of who they were and the positions they occupied, am I correct?  Certain people.    Right it may help us to understand the scope of the investigation more accurately if we asked you over what period of time did the investigation last or for what period of time has it already been in existence I should say?    Yes Veza.    Right but Veza at least has been going on-going for two years?    More than two years, right.      And during that time if you could give the Chair an indication of the number of people approximately not precisely you would have interviewed?    Chair we are not going to finish today.    That is clear.    We should do as much as we can.    I must confess my stamina does not match yours so I would like to minute it.    Yes that is true there is a mitigating circumstance.    Yes it does fit within the plan Chair.    I would prefer if we could – well it all depends on Ms K of course.  Perhaps we should consult her.    But I would not – because I have still got to prepare.    I would prefer if we could stop sometime around five o’clock.    Yes, no there is no witness to be pushed out.    Yes I think Chair it would if I may ask that we adjourn.    Yes Chair.    At ten.    Well barring any intervention from my right Chair we should get much further.    In fact virtually finish tomorrow.    But it is not certain we may have to go to Friday. 
ADV MOERANE:  Good morning Chair.    Yes Chair.  Chair will recall that at the end of Mr Jafta’s evidence you called upon me to indicate whether or not I had any re-examination.    I responded to that but apparently nobody could hear me.    And …    Yes, yes.    But – no, no, no I was not going to leave until and unless I was excused.  Chair     But the long and the short of it is that I – I did not have any re-examination for Mr Jafta.    And secondly.    If any such technical glitch occurs in the future Mr Ndebele is there ably to represent him.    Yes.    No thank you Chair.    That is correct Chair.      No, no, no I will be here.  I am actually briefed to represent the State Security Agency.    Not the particular witness but the Agency.    Itself.    For the whole week.    That is correct. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:  That is correct Chair.     And this is in relation to what was presented yesterday Chair yesterday’s evidence.      It is in relation to yesterday’s evidence that is why I felt perhaps it is appropriate for me to with your permission to …     To place the following on record.     Our instructions are to oppose this application.      All of our clients Chairperson.     Oppose it.     It is common cause Chairperson that we were never informed or rather provided a copy of this witness with a 3.3. Notice.     And the rules of 3.3. provides that if the Commission’s Legal Team intends to present to the Commission a witness whose witness – whose evidence implicates or may implicate another person, it must through the secretary of the Commission notify that person that is the indicated person in writing with a reasonable time before     Basically.     But that as well.  We have – we have – especially – ja, they are not that yellow team.  But at any rate.  It is common cause or rather Rule 3.5 provides     Chairperson ...[intervenes]      Well, Chairperson you know, a few minutes ago Advocate Pretorius was complaining about me not having spoken to, at least, you know, the courtesy of letting him know that we are going to read our letter into record but it is not understanding the same case that he expects from us to ask.   I hear from you for the time now Chairperson that the first prayer that is being asked for is condonation, you know, not complying with the rules in terms of at least informing us. We do not know – we are at a terrible disadvantage Chairperson.  We find ourselves having to respond to serious implications that impact on our clients’ rights without knowing what the real application is about and what the reason therefore is. It is my submission Chairperson that this is an injustice that cannot be allowed to persist in these hearings.       And I assume my colleagues as well would also want to respond.  And briefly Chairperson.  If what was told – we are told is correct that Ms K is here to confirm the contents of Mr Y’s affidavit. And we were told that that’s basically what was going to happen.   We submit Chairperson that this is unbecoming.  You cannot contain(?) what is not before the hearing.  But again, we – let me be allowed ...[intervenes]      Well, but it no status, at least at the moment.     So technically it is not before the Commission.     And if the purpose is ready to confirm that affidavit.  I know we have a problem of time.  The Chairperson has a problem with time.  A confirmatory affidavit should suffice.  With regards to ...[intervenes]      No, all I am saying is.  Submit a confirmatory affidavit.  You do not – let them testify.  You see Chairperson we cannot ...[intervenes]      So I beg ...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear.]     Mr Y.     Well, Chairperson our submission is that.  If they saw, experienced the same things then there is no need for Ms K to confirm that Mr Y saw and experienced.  She can submit her own affidavit ...[intervenes]      ...that deal with ...[intervenes]      ...those things that ...[intervenes]      Chairperson ...[intervenes]      So we then follow what you are saying.     But the reality Chairperson is.  We submit that Mr Y’s evidence cannot be introduced by a backdoor.  There is always a possibility that Mr Y can decide that no, no, no.  I am not proceeding with this affidavit.  He may, for whatever reason, want to distance himself from the contents of that affidavit. Hence I say, if they saw and experienced the same things, then there is no reason why we do not – why first Ms K’s affidavit has to be aligned to Mr Y. And two, why she is not submitting her own affidavit, explaining all the things that she recollects.  There is no reason.   The reality is that.  We are trying here to justify failure to comply with the rules.  And that Chairperson should not be allowed to happen.  People’s lives are being affected here.       I am done Chair.     Chairperson, we just want to place it on record ...[intervenes]      Chairperson, we just want to place it on record, just like what my learned colleague has done.  And to notify Chairperson that on the 24t h of January, we wrote to the Commission’s Legal Team objecting to the evidence of Ms K or Ms K coming to give or to confirm, as the Chair was saying, the affidavit of Mr Y.  Chairperson ...[intervenes]      Ja.  Chairperson, just like what we do.  We extent courtesy everyday to the Legal Commission, to the Legal Team of the Commission with my learned colleagues.   Yesterday, we extended the courtesy of trying to engage with the Legal Team in terms of what is it that Ms K is coming to do today.  And then we were told by members of the Legal Team that she is coming to confirm.   So we want to place it on record to say, just like what we did yesterday when we started, that should it happen, as we are seeing now my learned colleague has raised, that the client – his client was implicated.   Now should it happen that another client – our client or my learned colleague’s client is implicated.  Then how do we move forward in terms of that issue?   Are we going to say – are we going to accept what the witness has said?  Or are we going to now be placed in a position wherein we need to review?     Yes, Chair, my learned colleague has me to stand down for him to [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Thank you, Chair, mine is rather make comment rather to oppose the application as brought by Mr Pretorius.     Because we understand that – and the extent upon which our client has been implicated.  We find comfort as well to say Ms K will only be confined to what she understands based on the fact that she has been involved in the investigation as she will then lead and be led. However, the discomfort that we have, as much as some undertakings were made in previous witnesses to say you are not implicated, therefore you did not receive the Rule 3.3 notice but when the evidence leader, in the course of leading the witness, then certain people are implicated and it was brought to your attention.   I would only on the instructions of my client find comfort if I could hear that Ms K’s evidence is only going to be confined insofar as it relates to her involvement with Mr Y’s evidence, which is under oath.  Those are my submissions, Chair.     Let us assume, let us assume …[intervenes]     Without debating, Mr Chair, it is just for clarity.  Let us assume there are certain aspects Mr Y would – rather, Ms K would rather not go to because it would not be competent to give such evidence, can we have an indication from the legal team whether Mr Y at some point, having been indisposed at the moment, will come and testify to some of the aspects of his statement so that we get an opportunity to respond to some of the issues we respond meaningfully rather in a piecemeal fashion.  Those are my submissions, Chair.     Thank you.  Good morning, once again, Chair.  Mine is more on what the Chair has been referring to and referencing at least to the practice in the courts and to the extent that I understood what the Chair has said that it is a norm and possibly I understand the Chair saying it is a norm in this Commission. May I refer the Chair to what is commonly – the rules applicable here and my learned colleague, I did not hear because my colleague from the State, or the Commission rather, has requested that we deal with his application in separate by the fact that you then directed, Chair. That is, I would want to confine myself to what is the application brought to you today and to what extent that application should be opposed and how it should be brought.  My learned colleague has pointed out that two weeks’ notice, which is in turns of Rule 9.2, should give and reasons should be provided to you, Chair.  And the rules, therefore, enjoins the Chair to then exercise his discretion.  But it does not do so as a wide discretion because the rules at Rule 11 then provides for general applications that will apply, vice versa, to the Commission and to the participants in the Commission. May I then direct, with permission before the Chair to Rule 11?  I will probably want to read selected     As it pleases the Chair.    I am sorry Chair to take my learned friend a bit back on the paragraphs 5.9 that deals with the Toxicology Unit.  It was put to the witness Chair whether…   I think she -  it is under the heading 5.9.    Yes.    Up to 5.13.    Towards the end of 5.13 my learned friend asked the witness whether or rather how much was spent on the Toxicology Unit?  Her response was R1.8.    No, no specifically how much was spent on that unit – Toxicology Unit.    Not CDSO and her response was R1.8 million.  Now given the fact that the Toxicology Unit was part as alleged to say the least for now was part of the CDSO is that R1.8 a collective amount of is it specific for the Toxicology Unit?  That is the clarity that we seek Chair.  Thank you.    That is correct. 
COUNSEL: Chair we – yesterday we instructed our clients to place the following on record.  In the morning we are short by the Chairperson and the evidence leader Pretorius but none of our clients would be implicated by Mr Jafta’s evidence.  With that in mind and the need to mitigate the costs to our client we are inclined and we had indicated to the Chairperson that we are inclined to leave the hearing but thankfully our client’s instructed us to stay for the duration of Mr Jafta’s evidence. Regard being had to Mr Jafta’s written statement we understood why the Chairperson believed that none of our clients would be implicated by – in his testimony. The assurance notwithstanding Mr Jafta testified that a sum of R125 million and assets to the value of R9 billion were unaccounted for in the financial year 17/2018 and he attributed this to projects allegedly carried out of the office of the Accounting General – sorry Accounting Officer. It is common cause that SSA’s budget per annum is nothing close to R9 billion for them to lose that much in a year.  This obvious and we submit deliberate falsehoods will be rebutted in due course. Understandably the Chairperson was shocked   Well, they have rules for substitution.   Well, Chairperson the word confirmed is introduced by the evidence leader.  So ...[intervenes]  
REGISTRAR:  All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    All rise. 
MVUMBI: Yes, I hear, Chairperson. But, Chairperson, can Chairperson agree or – I do not know, is it too much for us to say it is common cause that Ms K cannot come to the Commission and give evidence to the Commissioner on an affidavit that is disposed (sic) by Mr Y. 
ADV MVUMBI:   No, Chairperson, I think the confusion would have not even been there if the legal team of the Commission is willing to engage.  Like I pointed out yesterday, the team – the legal team of the implicated people and it is a matter of time, it is a matter of us agreeing that after this presentation of the Commission of whoever witness is there for today, just like what Chair suggested yesterday, that maybe we stay for an hour, address the issues of the witness that is coming tomorrow. When Chair goes home later on after the Commission, is at a position of knowing all these issues that we will be raising here today and then that will make this Commission like very, I mean, easy.  But now we are faced with a situation where every morning we must do ground check, we must do housekeeping, which is not acceptable and at some point we even withdraw ourselves to certain issues because we are learned colleagues here and we must treat each other with respect.  And indeed we try to do that and we cannot go to the public and behave like people who do not have ethics.  Cannot do it.  That is my submission, Chair.     I have just received from my clients, the information that we had is that the evidence team has known for probably a while that Mr Y has been ill, has been in hospital, so it is not something that is new that came to their attention now.     So they could have [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     But they have had enough time to at the very least submit or give to us a Rule 3.3 notice that talks to Ms K and they elected not to.     But Mr K – or Ms K is not …[intervenes]     …Mr Y’s alter ego.     But Chair, that is ignoring the rule.  The rule says give us a statement or a extract of the statement, it does not say give us someone else’s statement upon which you rely. 
INQUIRY RESUMES:    
MS K:   Yes Advocate Pretorius I can.     Yes I do.     Yes.     Yes.     Sorry Advocate Pretorius is that – you said YY?     9?     Okay, yes.     Yes thank you.     Yes I am there.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes sir.     Yes I do.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes Chair, I don’t know if I should clarify the working together part.     I cannot say that we work together because Mr Y is not a member of the team, he is rather a co-sponsor of the project so he was getting high level sort of reports, just like the sponsor of the project, so he was not a member of the team and I needed to clarify that because the work that we did he did not really know the day to day running of the project.     Co-sponsor yes, but there was another co-sponsor and a sponsor, I am the project manager.     Okay, yes.     Yes Chair.     Okay.     Yes we have.     Pardon?     Yes. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes.     Yes I will indicate.     Yes.     Yes I understand that.     Yes I do Chair.     Yes, it is.     Yes.     Yes, they are. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes.     Yes, that’s correct.     I will.     Yes, I understand.     Yes, I can see that.     Yes, I can confirm that.     Yes, I can confirm that.     Yes, I can confirm that.     Yes, I am aware.     Yes, I do know that.     Yes.     Yes, I do know, I can confirm that.     I’m not certain.     Pardon, sorry?     Yes, that’s correct.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, I do.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, I do have knowledge of that.     Yes, I do know of it.     Yes.     Yes, it is.     Yes.     Yes, I confirm that Chair.     Yes, yes I do.    Yes thank you for that Chair. ADV PRETORIUS    Yes I do know that yes Chair.    Yes that is correct Sir.    Yes that is the vision.    Yes I do.    Yes I am aware.    Yes I do although not direct but I do know.    That.    Not direct but there has been reports to us. ADV PRETORIUS    Yes by some of the people that have cooperated with us.    Yes I do I do have knowledge of that and experienced it myself directly.     Yes.    Yes I do know Chair.    I would accept that with a 00   Yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Yes that is correct Sir.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes the operational directives.    Thank you.    Yes that is correct Sir.    Could you please repeat that?    Yes I have knowledge of that.    Yes I would like to just indicate that for me I do not think this means that it is all the projects because we do not know the entirety of the picture but most of the projects that we analysed and the documentation that we analysed showed exactly what Mr Y indicated in 3.8.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chairperson.    Yes I do Chair.    Yes it is.    Yes it is accurate Chair.    I cannot wholly confirm the cessation save for one instance which I do not know whether it is political interference but what I could gather from one of the implicated individuals during an interview was them admitting to taking money to fund the – protect Luthili House campaign.  That she indicated that the money was used to bus in people from KZN who were purported to be MKVA members and the SSA paid for their accommodation, food and transportation.  So as for the rest I can – I do not have the evidence because the investigation itself was – and the conclusions thereof are based on evidence – things that I could analyse and actually gather and as well as the team in you know in terms of analysis sent evidence that we can – we could actually analyse ja.    Yes.    Yes I think we will and maybe I will comment further when we get there.    In general.    Yes in general yes I agree.    My only comment is that this illicit value chain is very important in the sense that it shows how organised and orchestrated some of these activities seem to have been based on the evidence that we have.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair a large extent I do agree and confirm what is reflected there on 3.13 although I think – want to acknowledge that some of the individuals mentioned here actually their involvement was at varying levels and also there are other individuals that are not implicated – actually listed here who obviously I believe played a very critical role.    Could you please repeat that?    The Chairman was a bit inaudible in some parts so I did not catch most of what he said.    Ja.    Cannot hear the Chair.    Yes.  Yes Chair.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I do Chair.    Okay the first – the first one – maybe I should just read the paragraph.    Okay.     “An executive level the abuse of SSA’s mandate occurred primarily under the political leadership of Minister Siyabonga Cwele, David Mahlobo and Advocate Bongani Bongo and was executed or implemented primarily although not exclusively by Mr Moruti Noosi, Ambassador Thulani Dlomo, Ambassador Sondocugo and Mr Fraser – Arthur Fraser.     Yes, I can Chair.     Okay.  Yes.     Yes, I do Mr Chair.     Yes, I do.     Yes, it is.     Yes, I can confirm that.     Sorry, apologies Chair.     I just want to indicate that the latter part of that paragraph which talks about previously members of President Jacob Zuma’s Protection Team.  That I am not certain of.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, it is.     Yes, that is correct Chair.     Yes, I do.     Yes, that is correct.     I can say largely yes because I had the interview myself with the individual that provided that and there is a statement to that effect.  And we even have – what the report and you know for all of those personnel.  What I cannot confirm is the bypassing of official recruitment and vetting processes at SAPS and SANDF.  But in – with regards to SSA, I can confirm that.   The only thing I know for sure which I heard from one of the implicated individuals when I interviewed them was that they had, before they were brought over to SSA, they were at SANDF.   So I am not sure whether they were there having followed official recruitment and vetting processes.  But I can with authority indicate that on the SSA’s side there was bypassing of that.       Yes.     Yes, it is Chair.     Yes, I agree with the paragraph in its entirety.       Yes, I have. ADV PRETORIUS     I cannot confirm that they were absorbed within the JSPS Cluster in its entirety.  So maybe...  Ja, I cannot confirm that it is – I do not – Ja, I cannot confirm that.     [Indistinct] [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Pardon?     I can confirm that where it pertains to CDSO or that there was this appointment and they were absorbing things CDSO or his co-workers.  But I cannot confirm that they were also deployed to various structures in the JCPS Cluster.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.     Yes, I can.     The part that I cannot confirm Chair is the part where it refers to the deployment to various structures within JCPS Cluster.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     I am not sure what it means because it is not contained in our operational directives that govern the covert operations.  It is just a term that was coined, as far as we know, only in the MPD, you know, when it comes to the operational side.   But I am not sure what it means because even when you read various documents and submissions that were compiled by CDSO members, they use co-workers and sources or engines interchangeable.  So I am not sure what it means.     The evidence that I have looked at that is at our disposal was that the – I think we will address it later in this affidavit – is that these people were given contracts but when I – when we analysed those contracts, nobody signed on behalf of the SSA but these people were made to sign and made to believe that after five years they will be absorbed into the organisation.   So I am not sure if that is legal as there is no one representing the SSA in that particular contract.  So I do not – based on that, I do not think they were formally employed by the SSA.     Yes, I do.     Yes, it is correct.     Yes, I do.  I do know – I am aware of this.     Yes, I do.     I am not sure about 4.8.6.  So I have no comment on that one.  But I am not going to say, I agree with it.  I am not sure what it means.       [No audible reply]      Chairperson, what I can say is that.  Some of the duties – SSA would be deployed to, whether it is the provinces or whatever the officials and co-workers as well.   But you would find that the provinces are actually not fed with whatever they are collecting in that area.   And apart from that, whatever they were doing, the information was not channelled through the formal channels of information management and intelligence management within the SSA.   So in that respect I would say that.  But I am not sure about this “at least initially” part.     Yes, yes.     I ...[intervenes]      Chair, could you please repeat that?     Yes, I am not aware Chair because as – even as we engaged with the people involved, they do not actually divulge fully what their duties were.     And I do not – so I do not know how their duties evolved at the beginning or whenever.  So that is why I would rather not comment on 4.8.6.     Chair, maybe I should explain my understanding in terms of how they operated.     By way of an example.     There is a period, a six months’ period where about 25, 22 to 25 members of SO travelled across the country.  They would spend a month in a province.  Another month in another province.  Six consecutive months.  And that would include admin, HR, everybody even general workers.  And they would just say it is for operational purposes.     So.  But it is my understanding that most of the provinces did not understand what they were doing there.     But ultimately, it was costing the organisation a lot of money for all the people to spend a month, six months, six consecutive months in various places.  So I am not sure if that helps in terms of my understanding.     No, I do not know that.     I do not know any of that.     Yes.     My agreement is 4.8.1, 4.8.2, 4.8.3, 4.8.5.     It is – as I indicated earlier.  I am not sure about the deployment in the security cluster.     Yes, Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes?     Yes, I do not know.     It is correct.     Yes, I do Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes, it is. ADV PRETORIUS     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes, I do.     Yes, they are within my knowledge.     The conclusion that it was – it is more significant concentration of power?     I am not sure but the rest of that I agree with.     Because that is factual.     Yes.  Yes, save to – save for that, that last sentence that refers to the significant concentration of power.  So I would – I agree with the – with 4.12 just up to CSO.     The second last sentence.     Yes.     I am not sure if I can agree with the way it is described.     I have read that, Chair, and where it says on 4.13,     Yes.     Yes, thank you.     I align myself with the view that he expresses in     No, Chair, I am comfortable with the first sentence because what is in the quotes is taken directly from the document that is in evidence.     That is in evidence that we had analysed.  So I am comfortable with it because it is factual, it is stated there.     Pardon?    Yes, I see that.      Yes, I do.     Yes.     Yes, I do.     It is arrangements that are meant to support cover structures, operations, identities, so in that in that covert environment, even just in terms of operations, it is actually a [indistinct 10.26] that is there.     I partly agree because if it is close protection officers they are right there, they are being seen, so I do not know what backstopping would be required in terms of that.  So I guess I do agree.     Yes, I do.     Yes, I do.     Technical Surveillance Counter Measures.     I think it entails issues of like sweeping for bugs.     It is a – ja, I am not going to expand further on that.     I do agree with that.     Yes, this is factual, there was no mention of the roles that the others – the other departments had to play in that space.  So, in essence, it has created an impression that there was sort of like a vacuum in that space without actually providing an in-depth threat assessment in that regard.     I do agree.     Yes, I do.     Yes.     Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.     Yes, I agree with it.  In fact this is what we heard directly from her during an interview as well as another HR person that was assisting her.     I believe so although this document was never – the copy of this document that I saw was not signed.     Yes.     I agree with them, Chair.     I agree with the conclusion.     That is factual.     Yes, I agree with it.   I agree with all of them, all of these conclusions.     Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, it is.     Yes provided that everybody understands that we are referring here to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo.     They  are both…     Yes, Chair.     Yes, but …[intervenes]     Yes, Chairperson.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, I would say so, Chair.     Yes, I agree with that.     Where are we now?     Sorry, I am lost in terms of the document.     Yes.     Yes, I agree.     Yes.     I have to accept the correctness of that statement because if something – if that is the objective of the document I cannot dispute it.     Yes, we did have a copy of the presidential handbook.     And this part was actually drawn from there and we the only thing that we were certain of is the year because sometimes the handbooks revised but the one that we could get our hands on stipulated the rules as reflected here.      Yes, I do.      No, I do not.     Yes, I do.      Yes, it is.     No nothing.     I just want to refer to the document so that I do not miss quotes and confirm without - yes, this is accurate.  This is accurate, Chair.     I do on the basis that among the documents that we have, and also in our engagements with the relevant people who were responsible for these responsibilities within SSA, we could not trace whether there were MOU’s or with these departments which were coordinating the work, you know that would indicate that this service was requested from SSA.  So in that regard, I do agree that they did usurp the functions but if there is a document out there that can support that there was an agreement, then my view would be different.     Yes, when we spoke to Ms Dorothy that is what we were told.     The first one where we talk about legitimate SSA channels would receive the requests, I agree with that because it meant that PSS would still under SO’s still deploy their own people and do whatever outside of these formal channels. And also in terms of their unclear lines of communication, there were reports of tensions from the people who worked in this PSS from the SSA side when some of the implicated individuals did indicate that there was that tension that existed because of this arrangement.     I cannot confirm that it was to the detriment of the effective working of the protective because I have not engaged with - and the team has not engaged with SAPS and we have not gotten a view from that side, so I cannot confirm that.     I am not being overly cautious but I have to be conscious of the terminology that is used and what it means, what its implications are.  So if I am not sure and I do not have direct evidence of the detriment that was caused, I cannot support and say, and come in and act and speak authoritatively on that.     I did not, for instance I did not see any documentation that showed any complaints from SAPS in this regard.  All I saw we request and itineraries sent from SAPS PPU to SSA but they would say for TSCM, that is all.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you Chair.      Yes, that is what was indicated to us.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, it is a correct statement.     I think there is no indication that is true but I – no I think I have no comment on this one because it is very ambiguous for me because I see it as if it says there is no indication that certain risk assessments which according to the President should have been provided by intelligence or made available to SAPS and SANDF regularly or at all. I do not have a proof of that, I do not know.  All I know, I can say is that we have not seen any intelligence or intelligence products that came from this unit or SO in general.  So that is why I am not sure whether to agree with the statement or not.     I do not have any issues with the first sentence. However, the second one that says the lawful structure for the personal protection of the President namely SAPS was entirely side-lined.   I do not totally agree with that, mainly because there was - if I have seen documents that are bearing the emblem of SAPS and assigned by a senior member of SAPS that are being sent to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo then I cannot say they were entirely side-lined and because I was not on the ground I cannot, so it may have caused tension but I am not sure about the word entirely.      Yes, I would partially agree.     I think it is something that we did use, not that there is any proof that I have seen that he was doing exactly that. The only information that I can confirm is that some of the people that were involved in some of these projects carried out by CDSO did indicate that they were reporting directly to President Zuma.  In fact, some of the people that we interviewed in fact one did indicate that they were reporting directly to the President.  So I do not know whether that would be supporting that Ambassador Thulani Dlomo reported directly. I do not know because all of those people were reporting to him, so maybe it follows that he reported to the President.     Yes, they said - one of them even said they felt very powerful because they were reporting directly to the President.     Seen that they were deployed SSA there was an entire unit just focusing on that within CDSO I would say that, that sentence is correct.     We assume that all SSA members because as much as CDSO had the core workers were non-SSA members, there were also members of SSA who were involved there, a handful of them.  So I should assume that they were performing intelligence functions.  So ja, I do not know what…[intervene]     No, I think they were performing those intelligence functions, but whether these were in line with our mandate or you know whether it also followed our information management system whatever, whether - how that information was channelled, I cannot comment on that but I am assuming that they were performing intelligence functions.     Yes.     Yes, it is correct.  I am just not sure about the date, the year but it is correct the rest of the sentence.     Yes, it is. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes, according to the witness statement that we have, yes.     Yes, I am.     Yes, when we did the search, we could not find that organisation.     Yes, it is.     Yes, it is.     That is what we were told by one of the toxicologists.     Yes, that is correct but I have to also mention that while Project Khusela was purported to have replaced Project Accurate, Project Accurate still continued while Khusela was in existence.     That is what we were told, I do not know if it is correct, but that is what we were told.     I do not know what it is either.     That is how it appears based on the information that we gathered. ADV PRETORIUS     The documentary information shows that people were taking TA’s directly for Project Khusela but at the same time, the people that are working under toxicology, saying they were working, they were reporting to the PSS.  However, whoever was leading PSS says that unit never reported to them.  So that is why we asked, there was - we were faced with this I think we had to analyse whether were they travelling under PSS or were they – and getting money in that regard.  But or what we are sure of is that there were times that were taken directly for Project Khusela and when the settlements were done for those TA’s they attached receipts you know for travel and whatever by the Toxicology Unit, so that is why we – it is not actually clear.     That is the suspicion, that is why we are saying it appears.     Yes.     It is not entirely accurate.      My understanding is that – my understanding is that Remix had been established in 2007 independent of the SSA.  So the person indicated that their company was an environmental kind of company and later on when they – because they were get – they were receiving the R1.8 million a month cash from SO Operatives they felt that it was too much to handle that money in cash so the owner of the company offered Ambassador Thulane Dlomo that they can use her company so – to disperse these funds – these funds.  So that is the situation so I think it is not completely accurate the way it is put there.    The investigation was – the investigation team was informed by one of the Toxicologists that they never checked the Presidential aircraft.  So that one – that part is correct.   The second part which refers to in one document Ambassador Dlomo is cited as a donor to the establishment of the Toxicology Unit and referred to as Chief that is not completely accurate. He was – they – he was referred to as Chief Thulane Dlomo in documents where there was sort like an agreement with that foreign international development agency that we spoke about earlier.  So he appeared there as a co-sponsor for the project.  Not necessarily for a donor for the establishment of the Toxicology Unit.   I hope I am making sense.    I would be more comfortable with the paragraph if the – the first sentence – the first sentence is talking about having little impact since its establishment in 2012. I think there needs to be a qualifier there because we should say the Toxicology Unit under the – the umbrella of CDSO because ultimately there is still a Toxicology Unit within SSA but it is not necessarily linked to these activities. So in my view if we saying it appears to have had little impact since its establishment in 2012 it would then be misinterpreted to mean that we are saying the legitimate unit now that is under Counter Intelligence has not been affective.  So I am not in a position to say that.    Yes that is the one that we are talking about under – under CDSO.  However some of the members including the person that we interviewed who was recruited and polygraphed by these foreign people from a foreign country was ultimately absorbed into the Toxicology Unit that exists now.    Yes I will be comfortable with that.    I agree with that – that you would have expected that they would have detected – especially because there was no many – so much resources that were dedicated to protecting the President this would include the VIP Protection, the Toxicology Unit, the guarding of the plane, all of it by SSA.  So you would expect that at least you could detect that – the poison so I do agree with that statement.    Yes she did indicate that to us and ja.    Kindly repeat that Sir.    Yes.    I think it is – I think it is dealt with under the – the item where we talk about contracts.  The contract with Remix.    It was R1.8 million cash per month.    No except that I agree with the statement.    I think this is a correct reflection because we gathered this from – from an interview we had with a person who was very key in this project.    Yes.    I do because this is their – an account from a person that was involved in that space.    And they did say they were – they never got any training.    I think I understand where the question comes from because it is – the R1.8 million that was taken per month was for Project Kusile which was focussing on the Toxicology segment of the work of the CDSO.  So as a project so I am not sure whether the entire unit utilised only that amount.    Yes it could have been more.  Because the R1.8 million per month that I am talking about only refers to Kusile which is purported to be dealing with this area exactly.    Yes Chair.    In my – in my understanding is that the guarding of the Presidential aircraft falls within the mandate of SANDF.  So as much as – so I am not sure if this is completely correct.  Maybe it is just a typo or maybe I do not understand this completely.  But otherwise the essence of what is indicated in this paragraph I agree with.    No, no that is inaccurate Sir.    The – this is under – yes Chair.    I think so.  I think so Chair.  But I want to also clarify that …    That the intrusion of Presidential Security Support Services there it is more like we say similarly but it is actually not PSS that provided that service of guarding the Presidential aircraft.  It is actually another Chief Directorate – Chief Directorate Internal Security.  I just need that to be understood.    So it is not PSS.    Yes you are correct Chair. ADV PRETORIUS    Yes in my understanding.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    But I – sorry Chair.  I think it is important to note that both CDIS and CDSO fall under Counter Intelligence which would have made both units report to Ambassador Thulani Dlomo as the DDG Counter Intelligence.    I partially agree mainly because one of the people that we interviewed did indicate that they think that was the aim to take over everything you know around the President.  Particularly the protection everything that had to do with the protection.    Yes. Yes.    That is hundred percent correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    Pardon please repeat that.    I did not get the first part of that question.    Personally.    It is people that …    Not everybody most of the people that we – are implicated and we are in – we are investigating I actually met as we were scheduling interviews.  So at the beginning I was just dealing with names of people.  So I can say that 99. Maybe 9% of the people that are implicated in this project were not known to me.  So as – except maybe people that would be in senior positions where you know that who is the DG, who is the you know those prominent positions.    However the other people I basically met them during this investigation for the first time.    Yes.  And to also establish what positions people held most of our interviews started with just the beginning when a person joined the SSA what positions they held throughout.  So that also gave the team some kind of background in terms of where the person been, who they may have been exposed to and the kind of experience they may have had.    The investigation?    As indicated in the introduction there was Project Momentum which started in June 2018 so in December that is when Veza was established to reinforce what Momentum had already begun.  So that was December 2018 that I was – we were all – we were appointed but some of the members that were in Momentum continued in this.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I am Chair.    No I do not have any problem.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.
