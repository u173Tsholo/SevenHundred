CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.     Yes.    That is Exhibit Ya.    Thank you.    H’m.    Ja no that is fine.  I think we have had a number of people including some of the witnesses who have testified saying that the Law Enforcement Agencies had lost credibility and that they have no confidence in them that is why th ey did not report or do certain things and – and the nation might need to know whether there is a basis for that in regard to the Law Enforcement Agencies or whether those beliefs and perceptions really had no basis because Law Enforcement Agencies plays s uch an important role in society.  So we might have just – I think you are right to say let us hear all the details it might be a quite a challenge but it may be necessary if a credible determination has to be made at the end one way or another.     Ja.    Ja no, no, no that is fine. It also – the role of Law Enforcement Agencies exactly what they did and what they did not do and to what extent they may been influenced or affected by state capture might also be relevant to the question of the levels of corruption that have happened where we are.     Because if they are not acting the way they should act in regard to corruption then corruption may have reason because…     Of among other things the fact that they were not acting, they were not seen to be acting or people who were busy with acts of corruption knew that the Law Enforcement Agencies were not going to enforce the laws.    H’m.    Ja thank you.    Ja.    That is fine.    Now is the one that we are talking about?  I know that I have been given some document and the witness has been given some document.  I do not know if it is the same document, do we have the same document?    It is the same document.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine.  Ja.    Well in the end an analysis of various events that occurred and why they occurred, the way they did and why they occurred at the time that they occurred you know will be important particularly in relation to the Law Enforcement sector.  I do not know what I will make of this analysis at the end but I am quite interested in the analysis that was made by people who were involved in the events in one way or another at the time.  So Mr Pretorius has said that you may be – you may have to be of assistance I think that it will be important at some stage that as a witness who was party to the writing of this analysis that I get the benefit of hearing how you saw things and you be questioned on your analysis and you are able to defend it if you want to defend it and engage in a discussion of how justified that analysis is because I think it is quite important.  Of course as Mr Pretorius says there may be other who – who were party to writing it the same would go for them.  It would be important at some stage to look into – into those issues and – and give an opportunity to discuss the analysis and see how justified it was and you all get a chance to so to speak defend it or promote it or advance it so that at the end of the work of the commission it can be taken into acc ount in the knowledge that it is – it has been tested.    You talked about his statement did you mean the interview?    Okay.    Okay.    Thank you.    What is the page number again?     1301?    I am sorry.  Actually as I understood you they kind of handed over to – Crime Intelligence handed over to IPID to say continue?    [Intervenes].    Ja.    Ja.  No, no that is no that is fine.  I think, I think Mr Pretorius and I were not asking because we were saying this is no accurate but to say we have had the benefit of more details from you.     Ja.    I think Section 7(2) Mr Pretorius.    I think you read Section 2 flowing from Section 2.    Ja.  Section 7(2), ja.    Yes, I have got it.    I’m sorry Mr Pretorius I don’t know whether maybe it might be worthwhile just mentioning what the statute says in regard to that issue because at least Section 7(4) to the extent that that is the provision we are talking about, it doesn’t also refer to a report, it simply says the Executive Director must refer criminal offences revealed as a result of an investigation to the National Prosecuting Authority for criminal prosecution and notify the Minister of such a referral.  Would that be the provision that we are talking about when we talk about the requirement that the Executive Director is the one who must refer matters to the NPA, or that would be another one?     Yes.    Including reports, talking about reports for example in terms of the regulations or that’s where reference to reports might be.     Okay, okay.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.    Is it possible to look at it this way, that Mr Khuba when he submitted the first report regarded the investigation as complete at that stage, and that whatever  new evidence came up, came up later, which might strictly speaking have meant that once there was new evidence it should thereafter no longer have been regarded as complete, but from his point of view prior to new evidence coming up is it possible that that’s what they are talking about, you know the situation much better than I do because you’ve looked at all of these things and dealt with them.    Hmm, hmm.    Yes, so these, so what Mr July was telling you I think he started by saying suppose, I’m not sure whether that’s – but to the extent that he was telling you that Mr Khuba’s version was that that first report the investigation and that first report was final and tha t investigation was complete to the extent that that’s what he was saying Mr Khuba told him that was news to you.    You had not  heard that from Khuba or anybody before?     Okay thank you.    I think Mr McBride say it’s Exhibit YC.     What’s the page again?    1220?    1020, okay thank you.  Yes?     I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, Mr McBride you are emphasizing the status of that first reports quite a lot, and I just want you to confirm that you emphasize its status as having been a preliminary report or not a final report, or the investigation relating to it not having been completed because the part of the point you make is that the moment it’s accepted that that report was not final, the moment it’s accepted that that investigation was not complete this  whole thing about the charging of people falls away, and should have fallen away, the problem is why it was not recognised that that investigation was not complete and that that report was a preliminary report, that’s part of the point you make.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Did any – did anybody ever say to you including Mr July or challenge or question your right to ask Mr Khuba to do further investigations when you asked him after your appointment as Executive Director? Did anybody ever question whether there was anything wrong in you saying to Mr Khuba ‘just do further investigations here’, as you understood then?    H’m.    H’m.    You see it would have been important it seems that at least Werksmans, Mr July they look at that question whether you were entitled to ask Mr Khuba to do further investigations because if one accepted that you did have that right and Mr Khuba did further investigations whatever he got out of that investigation – further investigation whether it was against General Dramat or in his favour in terms of prosecution had to be taken into account.  In this case you say it happened to be in his favour and if it was in his favour it had to be taken into account as well.    And I imagine that there is an argume nt to say to the extent that Mr Khuba may in his earlier report have reached a conclusion that was inconsistent with the outcome of the further investigation.  He may well have been entitled to say well I cannot maintain that position in the light of what I have found out now.    So the question is, if the minds were directed to these issues maybe certain conclusions would not have been reached and the question is, I think from what you say is why they were – they escaped these issues as [indistinct] people?     Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    If you can avoid it.    Yes.  Are you asking for…     A longer tea break?    Twenty minutes. Twenty-five minutes altogether?    Okay alright.  That will take us to twenty to twelve?     We will adjourn until twenty to twelve.      We adjourn.    We had to extend our break by a further 10 minutes at the request of Mr  Pretorius so that he could attend to something relating to the evidence.  Thank you.     I think the emphasis behind Mr  Pretorius earlier question may have been to seek to establish whether what was new was an analysis of information that had been in existence already or whether it was new information with new analysis.     Yes.    Yes.    Okay, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Inconclusive hey?    Before you do that can I just establish was it ever established who had made the alterat ions on that first report?     Or you do not know?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Not Mr Sesoko.  Mr Sesoko?  I thought he had been given instructions not to.    In the first one.  I am talking about the first one.     The one that was said to have been altered.     Okay.  Let me repeat.  Maybe I have confused you.  You know when we talk about alterations to a report, to the report here.  As I understand it that is a reference to what we have referred to as the first report or preliminary report.  Now that is the report that had been done by Mr Khuba?    Before you were appointed Executive Director.     So I seem to get at some stage w hen I read some of the documents that it seemed to be unclear as to who may have effected certain alterations on that first report.  So my question was whether as far as you know it was ever established as to who had effected those alterations.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    No, I accept – I understand that because you did say that I think last week insofar as one talks at a general level.     I am just talking about the specific alterations that Werksmans and the Minister were talking about which were from the basis of you being charged to say certain alterations were made.  They were made with a certain motive or intention whatever.  So those specific alterations those are the ones I am talking about whether i t was established whether Mr  Khuba had made them or Mr  Mosing or was it never – was it in dispute as to who had effected them as far as you know?    Oh, okay.    Okay.  So, but the actual alteration was said to be on which report?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  So it was the first report?     Ja, but it was changed after there was the final report?    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.    Okay.    Are you going back to the statement?     Okay.    Does that mean you are done with the Werksmans Report or you will come back to it?     Oh, okay.  No that is fine.  Then I will wait.     Okay.    Please repeat the page number Mr Pretorius on EXHIBIT YC.    1007, thank you.    As a matter of interest do you know whether there is a reason why a transcript for interviews with other people are available but the one with him is not available or is that something that was not canvassed - they were not asked?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    But you also referred to the use of some recording that Mr Sesoko himself had made, was that a mechanical recording or just notes that he took, do you know, do you remember?     Yes, yes, but you say that was transcribed.     Yes, okay, alright, thank you.       Yes thank you.    No, no that’s fine.  Mr McBride during your interview with Mr July in whatever way or terms you may have put it, did you ever say or ask him something along the lines, what’s the whole point about this alteration of the report when there is new evidence, what’s the whole point, you know, if it’s altered because there’s new evidence what’s wrong with that?      Did Mr July or anybody who may have formed part of his team where during his – your interview with him, did they – did anybody ever say, but the recommendations you people made in the final report are not justified by the evidence that you are relying on or anything to that effect or did they expre ss criticism of the final report based on evidence that was available?      Yes.     Yes.     Thank you.   Did you say the pages 1443?     Thank you, you may proceed.     So Mr McBride as far as you can recal l, and I didn’t pick this up on the Werksmans report but you have looked at it much more closely I think over some time.  As far as you recall it never addressed or addresses the question of saying, if the alteration came about as a result of the further i nvestigation that was done, what was wrong with it, what was – was there anything unlawful about changing it in order to be in line with the later investigation, it doesn’t address that as far as you recall?     You know it’s – by the way we’ll hear, you know, other witnesses but you mustn’t feel bad about emphasising some of the points you have been emphasising about this report because if anybody is going to recommend, you know, that people be criminally charged they really need to apply their minds properly to issues because people being charged criminally is not a small matter.     Are you back to the statement?      Before you go – you deal with those Mr McBride, just to understand because you did mention earlier also that you and I think Mr Sesoko ran out of funds at some stage.  Now the application that you made to the High Court yourself and later the matter went to the Constitutional Court, the applicants there were reflected as yourself and IPID is that right or was it only you?      At the time you went to the Constitutional Court was it only you?     In regard to that same matter about which you went to the Constitutional Court were you the only applicant at the High Court level as well?     Amicus okay but wasn’t there an application that was brought by you and IPID, there was such?      Oh okay but that’s how far IPID went?      So the protection of the independence for IPID that ultimately the Constitutional Court confirmed is effectively protection that was confirmed, not just for y ourself but also for future Executive Directors of IPID and for IPID on your own so to speak without the institution itself?     And you paid for all of that.     And IPID did not pay.    Out of your pocket.      Yes, in regard to the matter that went up to the Constitutional Court I would imagine you got reimbursed went a cost order was made against the Minister?     Ja.    For that month?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    H’m.    Ja.    Okay thank you.    In regard to Part B was IPID – or let me first ask.  In pursuing Part B were new papers prepared or was use made of the papers that had already been filed in the urgent application, do you remember?    You cannot remember.    Okay but it was one applicant and that was you.     Leaving out the amicus and so on?    Okay.    Okay.    Okay thank you.    Yes we will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two.  We adjourn.    Yes you may proceed Mr  Pretorius. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Yes.    Well here is a starting point where any inquiry into what the Minister had asked Werksmans should have started.  In the terms of reference which from the Minister to Werksmans which is quoted in the Werksmans Report at page 1375.  The first term of    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    But in terms of – I mean you know what the discussions were between yourself and Mr  July during the interview.  At least assuming that what they were talking about reflected what the Minister had in mind.  When they talked about the alteration as you understood the position were they talking about a report that contained certain things at a certain time but after a period those things or some of those things had been altered in that re port as opposed to different views or recommendations being made in another report.  In other words if a report was one page were they talking on a basis that look this report which is one page before it had this sentence.  It now does not have that sentence.  Before it had this paragraph now it does not have that paragraph.  Before it did not have this sentence but it now has a new sentence.  That is what I am trying to establish whether this reference to alteration because that is the meaning it gives me as opposed to a situation where you say somebody has in a certain report – let us call it in a first report has expressed certain views and then in another and later report he has expressed different views.  Now if you ask me if a person expresses differen t views or recommendations in a second and later report.  Views that are different from the ones he has expressed in the first report.  That is not altering the report.  That is expressing different views in a later report but for me that is not altering the first report.  I mean it is true that – it may be true that the effect is that recommendation A which was in the first report is no longer the recommendation that stands but that is not because it is being altered in the first report.  It is because it is over written by a later report where there is a different view.     So I am trying to establish whether in truth there was ever any alteration of the first report in the sense that I understand alteration to mean as opposed to there were simply a change of views, a change of mind on the part of for example Mr  Khuba who might have expressed a certain view before in the first report. In the second report he associated himself with a different view or recommend ation because of a new investigation and then when it comes to – when it came to you and Mr Sesoko you had never expressed any view in regard to the first report you were expressing your views and recommendations for the first time in the second report.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, but to go back to my question.  Is it your understanding that what was an issue was never really about anybody going to the so called first report and changing sentences and crossing out somethings and adding somethings into that report as such?  As far as you recall what was an issue was that in the secon d report in - the final report views were expressed your recommendations were made that differed from the views and the recommendations made in the first report.  Is that your, is that your understanding of what the whole issue was about?    I am sorry just repeat that sentence.  Just repeat that sentence.  Your view is that there was a change or no change?     Yes, but hang on.  I am sorry to interrupt you.     Your understanding, is your understanding that one nobody could talk about you or Mr Sesoko having changed your views or recommendations about anything because you never participated in the first report.  Is that correct?     You never participated.  You had no role to in the first report?    To the extent that anybody could talk about a change of recommendation or anybody changing his view or her view that would only apply to Mr Khuba because in the first report he had expressed certain recommendations.  Those recommendations were different from the recommendations made in the second report which he co -signed?    That is correct.  So, so I am trying to establish whether this whole thing was about why Mr  Khuba changed his view that these people must be prosecuted.  Was it about – why did he change his view or was it about why did he go to the first report physically and cross out certain sentences or paragraphs or add things that were not there physically?     Hm.    You do not know?    Yes Mr Pretorius.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    The reference to deletion there would be more accurate to say they are actually talking about a failure to include in the final report something that was in the first report as opposed to deleting something that is in a certain doc ument, on your understanding?    Hm.    Well it may well be, it may well be that if you have got a hard copy of the first report but you have got the same report in electronic form and in preparing the second report you use the electronic version of the same report and then what you want to include in the second - in the final report you delete somethings and maybe that is the deletion they are taking about the deleting what is in  the electronic form as opposed to deleting what is in the hard copy.     Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes, yes, but the difference of course would be this, that as long as the hard copy, if there was a hard copy, I assume there was a hard copy that had been given to the NPA, if that hard copy remained as it was it represented what had been given and it had not been interfered with and what you had produced by copying and pasting if you want was another report, but you – that hard copy still stood as it was before?    There’s been no successful prosecution or there has been no prosecution at all or what is the position?      On the bribery case there’s been no prosecution?       Okay.    Yes.    I don’t think you said you were speaking on behalf of the legal team, I think you said the views expressed in the document that you put up were not unanimous.    Well it remains before me it’s available to me to read, I have – before that I had a look at least parts of it and you did say it’s not unanimous and you did – whatever you said is on record...(intervention).    Okay maybe before you tell us about the situation becoming more complicated I must just repeat that what I said was, maybe let’s not have a situation where we must adjourn Mr McBride’s evidence because we – the Commission doesn’t have a lot of time.  Let me hear his evidence but I still indicate that probably the way forward should include that submissions be invited from legal professional bodies, I may have mentioned one or two other people or instit utions to make submissions before any decision can be made as to what should happen with regard to any evidence that might relate to my younger brother and my plan is still that unless something that – unless something else happens my plan is still that I should invite certain legal professional bodies, I haven’t finalised in my own mind who else to make submissions so that at a certain stage I can then, if need be, make a decision whether – what should be done, you know, the – it’s an unusual situation bec ause if I was sitting in Court as a Judge it may have been very easy but I’m sitting here as Chairperson of the Commission and to make things more complicated the Commission wasn’t appointed in the usual way in which Commissions are appointed.  There was a remedial action from the Public Protector who prescribed – made certain prescriptions, there was a High Court decision which gave effect to the Public Protectors remedial action as to the selection of the person to be – to Chair the Commission.  So all of  those things will need to be looked at so that if I am the one who must make the decision as to what should happen to it I make it with the benefit of submissions from different bodies.  I don’t know whether it’s a matter which – I think there was reference to a possibility to – I think it’s in the memo or note that was written that was – that we talked about earlier, there was reference to the possibility that maybe the President could be asked to amend the terms of reference...(intervention).     Ja or the regulations so there are all kinds of things and certainly if I’m the one that must make the decision I would like the benefit of different submissions from professional bodies but I certainl y accept that the note you put up is there, it’s available to me to read in full – ja.    I would be inclined to say let’s get more information if General Booysen has something to say as well, let’s hear what he has to say before any decision can be made and if McBride is happy to pend that part of his evidence there is no problem, Mr McBride do you confirm, what’s your position?     No, no that’s fine I think that’s – that is the way to go because assume that the decisi on was to say, well if one looks at what Mr McBride has to say about Mr Mxolisi Zondo in regard to Mr Seseko’s disciplinary hearing if one were to say, when one has regard to the nature of what he has to say in the scheme of everything I should hear it then there would be a problem, if later on, General Booysen or somebody else comes up with something else so it might be better to say – because if in the end the decision would be in the light of what General Booysen may say in the light of what someone else  may say, I should not hear it then I may as well not hear the part of it that comes from Mr McBride.  So it’s more convenient to say, let see exactly what’s in – what every witness comes up with.     Ja thank you. But there is no evidence that should be heard that will not be heard. It is a question of who must hear it.  If it is evidence that should be heard it should be heard.  It is a question of who should…    Yes.    Yes.    Ja, ja.    Ja.    Yes.    It is a very complex…     Matter I think I have had time to reflect on it. It is complex because in terms of – not just in terms of reference in terms of a high court decision giving effect to the Public Protector’s remedial action evidence relating to matters that fall under the terms of reference as they stand they need to be heard by this commission.  Is the question if now it is somebody is it still being heard by this commission?    If it is being heard by somebody else.  But at the same time there may be situations where what – however you look at it I should not hear certain evidence.  I do not know.  I know that in the constitutional court we have dealt  with matters even where a colleague of ours is involved and we deal with them and we deal with them in the best way we can.  But it is not always the best situation.  So – so it is not an easy matter.  It is a matter that needs proper submissions to be made.    So that in the end there can be nobody suggesting that any evidence that should have been evaluated in a certain way was not evaluated in a certain way, in a proper way or was – evidence was heard by somebody who should not have heard it.  So we need to look at everything properly.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, yes, no that is fine.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  Okay thank you.    Yes alright.    Yes I think that – let us do that if – ja let us do that.    Yes.    Yes but we – for now you will play the recording.  Hey Mr Pretorius?    It is okay it is taking over – it is overtaking – it has been overtaken by events.    Okay not it has  been overtaken by events it is okay.  Okay alright let us hear the recording.  [LISTENING TO RECORDING]  [NOT AUDIBLE TO TYPE]     And some English as well.    And some English as w ell.  Some English.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    1459?    Oh yes.    Yes.    Well before we do that let us talk about how far we will go today.  It appears to me subject to you and Mr McBride being agreeable so that we should try and not finish before five.  What is your attitude I know you have been standing there for a long time?     A difference.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    The only thing of course is that if we ad d more time today we enhance our prospects of finishing tomorrow with him.     And maybe even earlier than later.  That would be the case if we do not add more time.  That is the on     That is the only consideration.    Hm.    Well I would like.    Ja.  I think after finalising what we will do beyond whether we proceed to five then we can take a break and then resume.     No.    Well I have not asked Mr  McBride.    Mr McBride what is your situation about proceeding to 5 o’ clock?    Oh, if we did not have to, but you remain available tomorrow?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    With Mr.    Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Well, but if we finished at half past four then you would be fine?    It would not inconvenience you.  Okay.  Well I am trying to strike a balance.  Finish at four and five, but half p ast four is fine with you?    Yes.  Okay.  Not that is fine.  I think let us take a break now rather than later.  It is about 26 minutes to four.  Let us say we return at quarter to.  Is 10 minutes fine?     Quarter, 10 minutes?    Should it be 10 to?  Quarter to four is fine.     10 to.  Okay. We will adjourn and resume at 10 to four.    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Yes you may proceed Mr Pretorius.      In other words reinstatement?     Yes okay.    Well Mr Pretorius if the time constraints to which you refer are such that, if they affect today as well as opposed to other days I will understand if there’s a request that we should not go to half past four, I just want to check whether adding that 30 minutes might just be an unnecessary inconvenience.     Oh, okay, okay.  Mr McBride so is your position that we should cover as much as we can today?     You say you didn’t see Mr Kgamanyane at work again.    Before your suspension he was Provincial Head in the Free State isn’t it?    He did go back there or you don’t know?     Yes, and certainly the Head of the organisation from which he comes should be informed or should have been consulted.     In the meantime General Ntlemeza had become, had taken General Dramat’s position as head of DPCI?     Oh, either he was acting or he was permanently appointed, ja.    Okay, but you were not consulted, your views were not sought and you did not – you were not asked for your consent or anything like that?    Mmm.    Page 1554 you said?    Okay.      Was he employed on a permanent basis during your absence or it was it was just a temporary arrangement?     Oh.    Just give me the page again?     Thank you.    Yes thank you.    Is that the end?    The technicians are looking at you.  [LISTENING TO RECORDING]    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I think he just looking for something before you…     You trying to look for something that will help you with the timing?    And sensitive in this context has a lot to do with the positions in government or society of the persons who were affected by the investigations?    Part of it?    Yes.  The other part was exactly what was being investigated?    Okay thank you.    I think Mr Pretorius your question was such that I think he had to think whether the conversation irrespective of who it was between whether it was proper or not.      So his answer that at whatever level it was improper.     Maybe should be understood in that context.     So ED was basically E for Executive D for Director?     Ja.    Ja.  Okay.    Before you proceed Mr  Pretorius.  Mr McBride a few minutes ago I wanted to ask you whether you are still comfortable.  Are you still okay?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.  You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    [Intervenes] Khuwa.    It must be Khuba on.    1564.    Yes we can take the – can adjourn for the day.  So tomorrow at half past nine I will deliver my decision in Mr Tom Moyane’s application for leave to cross -examine.  I will not just hand down.  I will give full – read the decision.  So that might take maybe 45 minutes.  I previously said we would start at half past nine.  So I think that certainly in terms of resuming the evidence of Mr McBride I do not think we would resume it before 10.  So I think Mr McBride you do not need to be  here before 10.   Ja and then once we have finished delivering the decision then we might take a break and then resume or resume immediately.  So we will adjourn until tomorrow.  So with the evidence i t will be after the delivery of the decision in the other matter. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.  Morning Mr Mc Bride.    Chair just two matters before we commence with the evidence once more.  The first is we have referred in evidence to two reports, the preliminary or first report fro m the IPID to the NPA and the second or final report which – both of which have been a matter of some controversy particularly the differences between the two.    The first report appears at page 191 that is the January 2014 report of the bundle, Exhibit Y.     Ya yes.  And the second one appears in the same bundle or same exhibit at page 227.     The second matter that required mention Chair is on Friday I said that I would consult with the witness in order to determine at what level of detail it was necessary to continue and whether matters of general import and general principle could be dealt with in such a way as to exclude debates about the rights and wrongs of the many issues raised by the witness.     On consideration and because there is no fixed determination made clearly by yourself yet Chair nor  by the legal team as to what actually occurred and why it occurred and because of the need to hear all the evidence first and then only make an assessment as to why Law Enforcement Agencies acted as they did whether they were deliberately, actively or pas sively part of any state capture project that you might find to exist.  It is necessary to hear the detail first and not to cut out any of the detail so that all the facts are before you when you need to make a final assessment.  There are various possible explanations for what occurred but first we have to show in details what did occur because what is beyond doubt Chair is that the acts or the lack of action on the part of Law Enforcement over the past ten years at least to central to the inquiry that you  must make.      Yes Chair.    So all we know for the moment is that the evidence that has been given under the rubric of Law Enforcement Agencies is critical to the terms of reference to understand what happened and why it happened and how it could be prevented from happening again.  And – but in order to determine the precise nature of the role without any pre -conceptions we have to hear all the evidence in its detail sadly and you will bear with us in tha t regard Chair.    Yes.    Yes    Yes that is precisely the point and that is particular reference to 1.5 and 1.9 which directs the Chair to examine the nature and extent of corruption.     Across a range of state owned entities and at all levels of government.     Thank you Chair.  Mr McBride if we could go to paragraph 43 of your statement it is on page 9 of Exhibit Ya.      We – we will deal with the Werksmans Report as part of your evidence this morning in such detail as may be appropriate but before we do that you will recall at paragraph 36 of your statement you raised the issue of the failure of communications between Werksmans on the one hand and yourself on the other.    I have been given two emails by the representative of Werksmans I presume in response to those allegations and the allegations regarding the incorrect addresses which were used as you state in paragraph 36.  Chair these will be handed up, copies will be made in due course and they will be included in the bundles.  Just by way of background when you physically le ave the offices of IPID in 2015?     Prior to that any communication addressed to you at IPID would have been received had it been correctly addressed?    The communications you referred to in paragraph 36 of your statement.  When would those have occurred?    Or not occurred becaus e the communications were never received by you because you say incorrect addresses were used?    Yes.  So the two emails that were handed to the legal team are dated respectively 13 April 2015 and 2 April 2015.  Just for the record would you look at them please and see if those are addressed correctly subject to of course the next question which is; were you there at all?     Yes you were no longer there.  But it is shortly after that that you actually had an interview with Werksmans?    So the incorrect communications that you refer to in paragraph 36 would be relevant the period before you left?    The second issue I would like to deal with before we start again with your statement you testified to a press statement made by yourself in conjunction with Mr Pillay and Mr Dramat?    Would you look at the documents now being shown to you please. Chair I will again hand up a copy to you.    It will be included in the bundle.    We may deal with this at some stage or we may just place it on record and deal with it in submissions or you may be recalled at some stage to detail the analysis that is begun in this article.  But in this article I understand there is an analysis of the state of play within Law Enforcement Agencies the similarities in various fields of investigation or non -investigation and an analysis of the possible causes and directions that the acts  of NPA are talking?    Much of it you already mentioned in your evidence but the question asked by the Chair which I ask you now is – is this a direct recording of your statement or is it extracts including commentary by the reporter?     It is the same document Chair.    About which you raised questions earlier.    It is there it will be paginated and included in the bundle.    But just to highlight some aspects of the article.  On the first page of the article the comment is    It continues   A few lines on – well let us just    Is that correct?    And then you state that it is incorrect – it is uncertain how the leaks happened.  Over the page you    In the next paragraph   Alright.  Now of course this is a high level analysis that you together with Mr Pillay and Mr Dramat have embarked upon.  It is something that the commission is investigating and will only make its own conclusions at the conclusion of all the evidence that it is to hear.  Insofar as your assistance may be req uired or the assistance of any other witness I take you quite happy to cooperate with the commission?     And we know that at the very least Mr Dramat and Mr Booysen together with many others to give evidence in relation to the same theme of conclusions?     Yes.      Yes.  And in the meanwhile we have to test the patience of the Chair and the public out there and deal with the detail.    If we can refer then to your statement before Werksmans and the statement is contained in one of the bundles; it is bundle B I think is it?  Exhibit Yb Chair.  We had begun with your statement on Friday and we we re busy dealing with extracts from your statement before Werksmans.  You raised a number of points which we have already traversed Mr McBride.  And amongst those points was the propriety or lawfulness of the investigation as a whole and you have told the C hair your views in that regard.  Some of – if not all of which were vindicated by the constitutional court judgment which later followed.  But for the present let us just deal with page 888 of Yb.      Yes.    My apologies Chair.    It was – this is a transcript of the interview which it seems common cause as a correct transcript.  Is that correct Mr McBride?     Up to page 888 as you have told the Chair and just to place your further evidence in cont ext you have raised two issues.  One was the issue about communications between yourself and Werksmans prior to your conducting this interview or agreeing to this interview with Werksmans.  The second appears on    You said   Those were the issues you  raised.  If we can go then please to the judgment of the constitutional court to see how Acting Justice Bosielo came to his conclusions and to give an overview of the conclusions he reached in the constitutional court judgment in regard to the independenc e of IPID and the powers of the Minister.  It is bundle C Chair, page 1301.     Exhibit Yc I should say.      1301.      1301.  1301 Chair.  It was a unanimous judgment of the constitutional court.  The cover page is at page 1301.  I do not intend to take the Chair through the whole of the    Yes.    Right.  And the respondents were the Minister of Police and the Minister for Public Service and Administration?    Because it is not clear at all times what power the Minister was relying on, is that correct?    Right.  And as friend of the court amicus curiae the Helen Suzman Foun dation was also a party that made submissions?    It dealt with your challenge to your suspension, is that correct?     Right.  If we could go to    And you have stated that the investigations were first initiated under Crime Intelligence?     Paragraph 10   Then paragraph 11   Paragraph 11 reads   You have testified in addition to the matters dealt with by the Constitutional Court with the distinction between the report on the one hand and the statements contained in the docket or case files on the other?     We do not need to address that again.    Although the report being the March or second report differed from the first report.  All the underlying evidence remained unchanged in the case file or docket?     Paragraph 12   I am sorry Chair.    Did I?  It is Section 7(2).  I am sorry Chair.    “The High Court found that inasmuch as the DPCI is independent despite there being no expressed constitutional infringement of its independence by parity off reasoning “the effect of the constitutional infringement of the independence of IPID is that the operational and structural independence of IPID must be at least as strongly protected a s that of the DPCI.”” Do you see that?    You have given evidence Mr McBride of a range of incidence and occurrences which the legal team will consider and your contention is that on several fronts the independence of IPID was interfered with both in respect of investigations of IPID and in respect of proceedings instituted against yourself and other officers of IPID.  Is that correct?     And that was the basis upon which you went to the Constitutional Court?     Specifically in this case in relation to disciplinary proceedings?     Then paragraph 16 reads   And your evidence if it is to be summarised in a single concept is that that independence was on a number of occasions testified to by you.  It did not occur?     Then if we can go through to    And that was the point you raised?    Paragraph 41 reads   Is that your understanding of the matter?    If we can then return then to your statement or rather the transcript of your interview before Werksmans.  You say - it is recorded that you say in the paragraph at the bottom of page 888 and we are back now (advocate moves away from mic).    On page 888 of the transcript    You explain that to Werksmans, Mr July as you have already testified to the Chair.  Is that correct?     At the bottom of page 889 you and because these are your words perhaps you should place them on record.  What did you tell Werksmans concerning the investigation by Crime Intelligence?  If you could just read the first few lines of the last paragraph on page 889 of EXHIBIT YB.     No, the first issue.    The second issue you raised.    Do not report to.    There is a word missing.  What would that word be?    Right and then at line five you make certain further remarks.    So right at the outset it appears you raised two issues before Werksmans.  The one was the general complaint really a constitutional issue as it turned out.     That the Minister should initiate these proceedings against you at least furt her to the extent of employing a private law firm – Werksmans – to conduct the investigation.    Right.  So not only are you raising the – let us put it – the external concern that the Minister had initiated this whole process.    And we have dealt with the Constitutional Court judgment in that respect but also the receipt by you of issues that concerned you about the internal independence of the whole investigative process not only the fact that Crime Intelligence had conducted the investigation as we know into its own members and, but secondly that even within IPID the independence of the investigation seemed to be compromised.  All those issues were placed before Werksmans?    And what you are also saying to Werksmans as I understand it is that when you asked for your report and you received the report on your assumption of office t hese matters were related to you and they were of some concern to you about the proprietary of the whole investigation that led to the issuing of what may be termed the first report.  Am I correct?  That is the remark you have just made.    Then you raised a further issue at the top of page 890.  Would you place tha t on record please?  From line 2.    By Khuba?    Continue then at line 10.    Just before you go on it appears as we have already remarked to the Chair that Crime Intelligenc e were in effect investigating their own members?     Have any of the members of Crime Intelligence being arrested?     By whom?     Then if you go to page 891 at line 4 what did you tell Werksmans there?      But how does that then gel with the statutory requirements that the Executive Director must sign reports.  It seems that there’s a mismatch there.      You ordered a review and the procurement of further evidence?      And then the question put to you at line 14 what was that question?      Yes that’s – it says what it says,    Yes.    Yes.  Perhaps it is correct Mr McBride that we are focussing too much on the extent to which other people focussed too much on the word “draft” or “provisional” or “final”.  The truth of the matter is you raised when you were briefed in March 14 serious questions about the independence of the IPID report that was then in existence but – or the investigation rather that was then being conducted.  You say you were not aware of a formal report.  But notwithstanding the existence of a formal report – you had concerns which you have raised now which we have dealt with from time to time in your evidence.    And those were serious concerns about the independence of the investigation and the manner in which it was conducted.  You therefore ordered a review of the investigation and the finalisation of the investigation in r egard to warning statements and in regard to cell phone record analysis, correct?     You then signed a report that took account of the further investigations directed under your command, is that correct?     And then you submitted that.  So it seems that it is at least arguable that whatever the status of the so called first report or provisional report by whomever  it was signed and whatever its purpose all including Advocate Mosing knew that there was further work to be done?     And whatever opinion was recorded in the various reports it is still incu mbent upon the prosecutor to make his or her own decision not on the basis of IPID’s opinion but on the basis of the original evidence and the report?     Or in the file.  And that was never interfered with?    And would have been obliged to come to an independent conclusion?    Given the responsibilities of a prosecuting authority?    Alright.    Yes.    Chair is this a convenient time and may I ask that because I need to traverse a  particular issue that has now emerged as to what Advocate Mosing might have said about the earlier report being a draft report.  I just need to check som ething with the witness if I may in relation to transcripts and the bundle.  I do not want to spend too much time on the detail of the label attached.     To the first and second reports.  What is clear is that further investigation needed to be done and if it had not been done there would have been a serious problem laid at Mr McBride’s door.  But I do want to just place one piece of evidence in this regard before you and then move on.     The short adjournment.    Say twenty minutes Chair or twenty-five minutes?    Yes please.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Let us go to page 894 please.    Of EXHIBIT YB.  This is a continuation of the transcript of your interview with Werksmans.  At page 894 line 14 you say what further investigation or work needed to be done.  That was a new analysis or an analysis of cellphone records.  Was it an analysis of a new analysis of cellphone records?     Okay.    But an analysis had to be done.  I do not want to go into too much detail.     And additional statements and warning statements you say?     Then on page 896 you are asked - I just want to clarify this point.  At one stage you gave the docket  to the Minister and you say yes 14  April 2014.  Is that correct?     Well you say 14 April 2014 the date it was signed.  Is that the docket?     And you say later down the page that it was in November  2014 that it was given.    And then over the page you say at line 10 that is page 897 of EXHIBIT YB that of course later on it became clear that the Minister disagreed with your report and that the Minister said as much in Parliament and we know said as much to IPID itself in March 2015.    And it was in Parliament that you told the Chair earlier last week that you approached the Ministe r and said that you had made a mistake and there was a way to deescalate the issue?    At the stadium in Cape Town.  Alright.  Whatever Mr  Khuba or Mr Mosing - Advocate Mosing - might have said to Werksmans we deal with separately.  They can account for what they said, but your evidence is or your interview with Werksmans    Page 900 lines 3 to five.  You see that.    That is what you said to Werksmans.  Is that correct?     Is that correct?    And then at the bottom of the    “I did not say it was inconclusive report.”     So let me just repeat.  I may have got it wrong or not being clear.  It is put to you at the bottom of    And then if we can go to page 904 please.  On several occasions during this interview you make it clear that you were aware at the time of a single report which was in your view the final report which you signed which contained the additional investigative results which you ha d directed.  That you repeat several times but on page 904 line 10 you say in relation to a    Well as at the time of the interview 17 April 2015.    You do say at line 10 on page    At the bottom of the page 904   Those are fully analysed in the Werksmans Report in a spreadsheet.     You are aware of that?    The statements themselves you have repeatedly said remained in their original form?     It was an analysis of the statements contained in reports?     So were certain quotations in the first report omitted from the second report?     What was the reason for that?     Right and we will see what Khuba says about that.    Can you give one example to illustrate the point?  I am not going to go into a full analysis of all the transcripts.    Because we made the general points about the report.    We can put away that bundle for the moment then.    In that regard perhaps we could go to page 1237 of EXHIBIT YC.  This is a statement by Khuba on affidavit in the litigation to which you have referred.     Paragraph 21 reads   You would bear with me Chair.    The first or the cover page of that affidavit just for record purposes is in Bundle YC – EXHIBIT YC at page 1225.  Just go to 1145.  Also in Bundle YC at page 1145 is Khuba’s statement during the course of the Werksmans interview that    Is that correct?    Then in paragraph 43 of your    Paragraph 43 page 9 Bundle A.    Yes Chair.    Bundle YA page 9.    Well that depends on the answer to the next question.    But we may have to go to.    Beginning page 1017 which is still in Bundle C.  So perhaps if you could keep it at hand Cha ir.  The affidavit that you prepared for the purposes of the High Court application which later was dealt with by the Constitutional Court is Annexure G in Bundle YC and I am referring to not your founding affidavit for present purposes, but I am referring  to your replying affidavit because in the answering affidavit the Minister relied to a large extent on the Werksmans Report.  So if you could go to page 07 of Bundle YC please.    Page 1007.    Do you have that affidavit before you?    To place this replying affidavit in its proper context it appears that in the answering affidavits in the matter before the High Court where you challenged your suspension the Minister had relied to some extent on the contents and findings of the Werksmans Report.    And in reply then you dealt with the Werksmans Report?    Now we have dealt at some length with issues related to the Werksmans Report and your critique at a high level and at a detailed level with the contents of that report.  Perhaps it may be necessary at some stage to do a thorough analysis of the record, because the record is there as it stands.  We have been  provided by Werksmans with all the transcripts of evidence save of one person who is Advocate Mosing.  Is that correct?     Alright, sorry.  I got that wrong.  It is Mr Sesoko’s transcript that is not contained but other than that we have been provided with the terms of reference, the report and the transcripts of evidence of all who participated in interviews save for Mr Sesoko?    Alright.     Paragraph 6.4.5 is the recommendation that concerns yourself it reads, “In the absence of any information as to which  of the three co-signatories were responsible for the deletion of information from the first report we recommend that Khuba, McBride and Sesoko be charged criminally for defeating the ends of justice or obstructing the administration of justice and that disciplinary charges be brought against them in their capacity as employees”.  Just a number of remarks arising from your evidence and then we’ll conclude this part of the evidence Mr McBride, it seems that what Werksmans concentrated on was the deletion of portions of the statements quoted in the reports.  So not the deletion of the original or any alteration of the original statements which remained intact but those passages that were quoted in the first report and the second report.     There are no findings here it seems, in relation to the necessity for the additional i nvestigative results contained in the second report it simply seems to concentrate on the deletion of information in the report.      It seems then, in summary what you are saying is that to accord the so-called first report with a quality that it can never be changed or commented on or subjected to a further investigation is factually and legally incorrect you say?      Secondly you say that the assessment that gave rise to the report in its final form including the decision as what quotes to retain and what quotes to omit from the witness statements, is a matter of judgement by the authors of the second report and there was nothing untoward in the exercise of that judgement, that’s how I understand your evidence.      And it’s addressed to the actin g Executive Director Independent Police Investigative Directorate.      You say in paragraph 46 on page 9 that Khuba and Sesoko were suspended by Kgamanyane, the then acting Director of IPID on 21 May 2015.  You say that, that was on the instructions of the Minister is that correct?      Is that why you explained that in the Constitutional Court it was only you, prior to that it was IPID?     Mr McBride perhaps it needs a slight degree of clarification.  The original Notice of Motion and the application to the high court concerning your suspension is at page 143 of bundle of Exhibit Ya.  But let me just put the sequence as I understand it from a review of all the papers.  An urgent application was brought in regard to the suspension to which you have referred.  In that application there were two applicants, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate and yourself?     That application had two parts.  Part A for interim relief on an urgent basis regarding your suspension.  Part B a declaration of unconstitutional ity and we have been to – into that detail.  Part A the urgency the judge found that it was not urgent?     Yes but anyway Part A relief was refused?    That was the application for urgent relief?    Quite how it was phrased.  It is not necessary to debate that now.  Part B then continued later and at that stage you were the only applicant, is that correct?     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  But Part B eventually ended up in the high court.    And then went onto the constitutional court.    But when Part B was determined you were the only applicant?     Alright.      Again just to complete that line of questioning.  In the original application in which IPID and  yourself were applicants your founding affidavit traverses all the issues that finally came before the constitutional court?     That affidavit is at page 148 of bundle Ya.  But let us return to the point which we have arrived at.  You say you were suspended for a period of eighteen months.  You came back and you found that things had changed?     And you are now going to tell the Chair of how they had changed particularly in relation to restructuring appointments and dismissals and transfers, am I correct?     Okay.  In your absence how many senior managers were suspended or transferred?  You deal with that in paragraph 47.    Suspended or transferred?     I am sorry.  I interrupted you I am sorry.    We will come to the detail later.     Or some detail later.    Just a question before the long adjournment.  Do you recall the analysis that you did together with Messrs Pillay and Dramat?     The notion that a senior officer bearing some responsibility in a state institution is removed and that is followed by an overall restricting and other dismissals and appointments.  Was that unique to IPID?     Yes.  Chair may we adjourn?     My apologies Mr McBride.  If I can take you back please.  The Werksmans Report appears at page 1371 of Bundle YD that is EXHIBIT YD.  Would you turn to that please?     You will recall just by way of background to my question which follows that at all times we have spoken of a provisional or first report signed by Mr  Khuba and a second report signed by yourself, Messieurs Sesoko and Khuba.  Is that correct?    The second report differed from the first report?    Right.  Now that - an analysis of those differences appears at page 1404.  Leave aside the additional matters about which Werksmans makes comment as to whether it was necessary or desirable at all.  That is a different issue, but at 1404 is analysis of what is referred to as IPID Rep ort 1 and IPID Report 2. Do you see that?    Yes.  No evidence was ever tampered with or deleted?     The evidence always remained in the form of witness statements in the docket?     Yes.    Yes.    Right but in any event it appears from page 1404 that the statement of Ndanduleni  Richard Madilonga had been quoted in the first report?     And the quotes from that statement in the second report differed.  Correct?     And Khuba explains that in his affidavit.  I will come to that in a moment.  The same category of  observation is made in the report right through to page 1415.  Do you see that?    From 1404.    To 1415.  Now I am not going to go into the detail.  At a particular level we will be here for several weeks if we do that.    Save to say the issue taken by Werksmans appears properly regarded not to be any a lteration to evidence but merely to what Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko thought as relevant quotations to the report.  What is your explanation for these “changes”?  Just at a general level.     Well perhaps without any presumption what the DCJ is putting to you is this.  The first report was always there on file?    No one took that first report added, deleted, changed the recommendation, threw the original first report away and put the second report on file.  Two reports were always on file.  One in one form, the other in the other form.     Okay and what appears to have escaped perhaps the Minister ’s attention and Werksmans attention is the fundamental issue you raise with the first report that it was largely the project – the product rather – of the Crime Intelligence investigation.    And so that first report far from being incapable of alteration or supplementation or being subjected to another view it is arguable that no regard should been had to it and you should have started again.    If necessary the report maybe subject to further analysis and debate but just to highlight the approach of Mr Khuba it appears at 1236 of EXHIBIT YC.  You have testified that Khuba was doing an investigation into the rendition saga under the supervision of Mr Mosing – Advocate Mosing – of the NPA?    And Khuba had inherited the docket for want of a better word from Crime Intelligence?     Khuba had a number of concerns which he highlights in his affidavit but in paragraph 19 on page 1236 he    Leave aside whether that also interferes with the independence of IPID or not.  His explanation is    In paragraph 23 over the page,    But as far as you are aware that was the correct approach?     In any event to just make it clear     What did – to your knowledge what did he do as soon as he took office, you deal with this in paragraph 50?     Right now that case, was it investigated by IPID?     Or the regulations.    Yes.  Thank you Chair.    It will indeed be heard in the form manner and by the person …     That ultimately has decided…     At least under your initial direction.    Maybe that the person who finally hears it is appointed by someone else.     If that is possible at all.    It is a complex …    Matter.    Yes.    Yes.    To be fair to all concerned particularly yourself Chair to have heard the contents of paragraph 51 the opinion there would not have affected any  final decision that you might have made.  The situation is now different.     Where there is further direct evidence.    That requires a fresh approach to the problem.    And for that purpose you have the submissions of the legal team.     And any further submissions that the legal team might make.    Plus submissions of outside.    Bodies including the Presidency.    Paragraph 52 Mr McBride  you say that Sesoko also faced criminal charges together with Mr Khuba and yourself?    For fraud and defeating the ends of justice?    And you have already said that those criminal charges were withdrawn on the 1 November 2016?     Yes just to illustrate the point.  You have one case.    The one is withdrawn because it has a duplicate?    Alright.  The Chair will in due course consider all evidence placed before him and make a finding in relation to whether these are coincidences or whether there was a design behind them.  Let us go on with your statement.  Tell the Chair please what the fate of Mr Khuba was?  Was he also suspended on the 21 May 2015?    But just to complete what you say in paragraph 55 if we may?  The reasons for his suspension I understand were the same as the reasons for your suspension and Mr Sesoko’s suspension?    Then in paragraph 56 you refer to certain events that took place before his dismissal which followed.     In fact according to – if Mr Khuba does give evidence and according to your evidence Colonel Mlongo visited Khuba on a number of occasions?     And this telephone call is the last one of the last in these series of communications whether personal interactions or telephonic?     Chair if we continue to five that may help, but I am not sure in the end it will make much difference.     Because in any event we will not finish today and we are in for tomorrow as well.     So whether we finish at four or five.    I do not think it makes a material difference ultimately because as discussed with you over the long adjournment.    It is unlikely that we should call the next witness who is also.    A witness whose evidence is of some length.    So.    Yes.    That is.    Ja.  That is entirely in order Chair.  Thank you.    If we may just take a break.    At some stage between now and five.    Well I thought that we had reached “an agreement” on the issue Chair.     We would proceed today till five [intervenes].    Sorry.    Yes Chair.    At.    Quarter to four, yes.    10 to Chair.    Thank you Chair.     What was that interaction?  Chair we’re obtaining the warning statement, we just haven’t got it yet.      In paragraph 60 through to paragraph 75 ...(intervention)      Yes I speak entirely against interest Chair but it may require us to go further today because the problem is tomorrow.     From paragraph 60 of your statement on page 12 of Exhibit YA you deal with what you discovered on your return in regard to what happened to senior personnel within IPID, correct?    And there are various other matters in respect of whic h you requested information, is that so?     You requested information on various operational matters?     Take your time, it’s in paragraph 78.    I want to deal with the recording.  If you could go to Annexure Q which is at page 1557 of Exhibit Yd.      And then male 1 who is that?     For the moment just to place  on record there will be independent evidence in regard to this conversation including a participant in the conversation.     Alright.  So what we have  here is a conversation between a senior officer in Crime Intelligence and an investigator in IPID Mr Mlongo.  Mr Mlongo was at the time engaged in a number of sensitive investigations involving members of the South African Police Service?     Yes.    And on page 1560 the rank is discussed first Brigadier then Colonel?     The validity of such a statement is …    But at the bottom of page 1561    Who is ED?    It is 204 of the Criminal Procedure Act?    For the moment what needs to be explained is a conversation between a senior officer in Crime Intelligence speaking to an investigator in IPID who is investigating a number of sensitive cases.  An offer of employment at a level far more senior than that being held at the time by Mr  Mahlangu.  You the Executive Director “going down” evidence to be given in a case where you are to be an accused and he is to be presumably an accomplice that appears on the face of it to be the case.     And yourself.    Were you not charged with entering premises?    In a counter investigation.    But you were the subject matter of that charge at a stage?     Then I misunderstood what you have told me previously, but we will get there.     The people involved seem to be those referred to at the top of page 1565.  Is that correct?     Page 1565.  Well let is go to    And then at the bottom of the    But what is being discussed here is the context of the promotion, you are going down is the fact that one of the persons to be added to the list they do not have anything against him thus far but they are looking for a way of finding a case against him.  Am I correct?    I understand that but perhaps what we should do is deal with your evidence on the counter investigation.    First.    Then this will make sense.    But for the moment it appears on the face of it that this conversation  is talking about a potential case  against seven accused?    Included in this conversation is the prospect of joining Mr  Sesoko as one of the accused.  Correct?     At the bottom of the page there    Well Khuba is mentioned over the page.  It is spelt K-H-U-W-A, but I think it should refer to Khuba not Khuwa.  Do you see that?     Yes, Khuba is mentioned on  1565.    Not on 1564.  Where?    Oh I see that yes.    So.    Setsubi who is Sesoko and Khuwa who is Khuba.  Yes I see that.  Is that the one you are referring to?    Right and there is the question of finding evidence at the bottom of page 1564.     “But if we can find a way like we discussed that day like finding a laptop we could find the case that he committed.”     No I understand.    I am just dealing with what is said in the transcript.    For the moment rather than.    Commenting too widely on it.  It is [indistinct] – it is clear what is being said here.  Correct?     The last question I would like to deal with for today and then we can come back to this refreshed    What is the name of the secretary of Paul O’Sullivan?    Alright.  So she was also part of?    Okay.  So the people here and we will give context to this later, who are they?     Let us not go into the detail.  We are coming there I promise, just the people.  That is Mahlangu, the ED who is yourself.  Paul I presume is Paul O’Sullivan.    And Nkabinde, Binang and Prince.    You do not know who Prince is.  Now just to foreshadow what you will tell the Chair tomorrow is that IPID officials were investigating a number of police officials?     In response to that investiga tion there was what you will refer to as a counter investigation?     You say on – you will say as I understand it on spurious grounds a whole investigation was conducted as a response and that went to court and was the subject matter of a judgment by His Lordship Mr  Justice Stockton which we will deal with tomorrow.    This is an appropriate time Chair.  I think we all need a break. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.  I think for the purposes of the judgment and the Constitutional challenge the exact details were not brought.    Before the court.    And hence Judge Bosielo is raising the issues as is evident and in front of you.     Thank you Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.  Against in particular myself.    That is correct. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Yes Chair.    That is correct yes.    Absolutely.    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct, yes.    That is correct Chair.    The second issue.    Okay. “My issue in the briefing…”  And I cannot remember the exact sequence of events.  “…was firstly Crime Intelligence was involved in the case from the beginning.  [Intervenes].”     “The second issue was that my predecessor acting Ms  Mbeki had told Khuba – Mr Khuba just report directly to me.  Do not report to.”    And.    Sesoko.   “So for me already independence in the investigation was compromised the way it had been said.  In other words bypassed ahead of investigations.  Those were my issues immediately that was my concern.”     Yes.    Thanks Chair and also just to say in the interview with Mr July I am reporting on my first meeting with Mr  Khuba and the immediate concer ns that I raised with him when being brought up to date with the circumstances in which this case arrived at IPID.     Yes.    That is correct.    Yes.  That is my, my concerns about how the document reads, the docket reads.  IPID, how it was prepared by Crime Intelligence and the involvement of Crime Intelligence and the exclusion of the National Head of Investigations and sinister secrecy attached to what was expected of Mr  Khuba which Mr Khuba raised also with me initially that he himself was concerned but was put under undue pressure.    Yes. “This is what I was told.  Then also that…”     Yes.  That is right sir. “Then also that he must work with the Crime Intelligence guy and the Crime Intelligence guy also linked him up with Advocate  Mosing.  So for me already independent investigation was compromised the way it had been said.  In other words bypassed the Head of Investigations.  Those are my issues immediately.  That was my concern.”   “I was also concerned because it became apparent that Crime Intelligence operatives were involved in the arrest of the Zimbabweans themselves.  They were als o involved in the illegal repatriation.  Those are my concerns.  Then I questioned because there were many people involved who was involved at what stage in this crime that you mentioned to me and to what extent.  I also asked what crime has been committed  by who and who was involved in it.  What are the elements of that crime?  That is what it was.  Basically that is what it was.”    That is correct.    They have been arrested prior to this incident.    By some of those making statements which were brought to IPID had been arrested by General  Sibiya on a previous occasion when General  Mdluli was appearing in court subsequent to having been  arrested by General Sibiya.  General Sibiya and his team then arrested some of the same Crime Intelligence people who were dressed in plain clothes and were putting the DPCI Team under surveillance and they were then approached by General  Sibiya and his team and were arrested on suspicion of about to commit a crime. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Thanks Chair.    In essence to make the distinction it was specifically an analysis related to towers.     As to the.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chair it was – if I can put it this way - as far as I am aware there was, there was not any information related to cellphone analysis yet.    In the docket.    But some cellphone analysis was done but it involved as to who called who.     But the issue relating to the towers.     That is where this phone was on a particular day.    Or on a particular set of dates.    Had not been done.  It now had been obtained and needed to be.    Thank you.    Ja.  During the interview I, I might have got the, the actual date wrong.  We are still awaiting the date of confirmation when the [intervenes].     Yes that is correct.    That it was given to the Minister yes.     That is correct.    Not in Parliament.  It was at the stadium on [intervenes].    (No audible reply).    Yes, I got that.    That is correct yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I am not sure why Mr July was confused at that stage and why he put it to me that I spoke about an inconclusive report that I had signed.  It is a – it does not fit in the context.    Chair if I can just come in here.  That is very critical about the confusion of time and its passage because what I had indicated earlier is that in March on arrival in IPID I did not know about the report.  A year later Mr  July suggests to me well then a year later after everything and after signing the final report you cannot speak about inconsistencies between the two reports.  Whereas a year later I would have seen all relevant repor ts relating to the subject but I think his, his question there is - basically expresses his confusion with the passage of time which I made a point on, on I think Friday to that one must be conscience of the passage of time and different things happen at different stages.    Ja.    Ja.    That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Exactly and particularly what was the evidentiary value against the background of the new evidence.  So what had been said initially could – no reliance could be placed upon it.     Yes that is correct.    According to Khuba they were of no evidentiary value.    Yes and even now if you read what was removed it is of no evidentiary value in terms of the.     I think in one.    Ja, in one statement someone reports about someone going to a liquor store to buy some liquor.  In the scheme of things it is kind of irrelevant.  So Khuba leave it out and adds more relevant stuff.  So in terms of just stating from the original statements taking large, large chunks of quotations.  In the second statement he is more particular about what the value is and stuff that sort of adds up the report with no evidentiary values removed.     I.    No, it is established.    Mr Khuba said he had made the necessary changes.    Based on the new evidence.  So it was never in doubt that Mr Khuba said he had worked with Mr  Sesoko.    On Mr Sesoko’s.    Oh, in the first.    [Intervenes].    I am not aware of that.  That the first one.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    I think it is common cause between Mr Khuba and Mr Mosing.    That they would send the reports.    Of those preliminary reports to each other and on occasion Adv ocate Mosing would send it back to Khuba again.    With some alterations on whatever the issue was at that stage.    But it is not in dispute that that was taking place and that there was.    Yes.    Thanks Chair.  If I am understanding you correctly it would be - and to respond – it would be the report that was done during, after the review and the addition of the new evidence is the, the second report which Mr  Khuba then changed the analysis – the emphasis of analysis on the report under the supervision of Mr Sesoko and they had worked on Mr Sesoko’s computer.    Ja.    Well in essence the first report, preliminary report was changed.    By Mr Khuba.    To accompany the docket.    Ja.    That was - that was changed, yes.    The final report effectively changed.     That preliminary report.    I have it Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    One second Chair.    I have it Chair.    Yes sir.    Yes that is correct.    That is correct.    No that is not correct Chair.  It is Mr Sesoko’s entire interview and transcript has always been absent from the Werksmans Report.    Ja.  In fact with the - during the litigation period we relied on Mr  Sesoko’s own recording he made which it was transcribed and authenticated and we made use, use of that but Werksmans does not refer to it at all.     And they do not supply it even though Mr Sesoko was interviewed by them.     I do not remember it in detail now Chair, but Mr Sesoko is, Mr Sesoko is very legally minded and very direct.  So he would have put legal status of everything immediately on the table and from memory he indicated to me and I might have seen it in a transcript – he inquired to Mr July as to whether he was a suspect in anything.    And Mr July replied in the negative.    Which would reflect very poorly on Mr July.    On the fact that Mr July makes recommendations.    I have it sir.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, which is incorrectly titled “Deletion of Evidence” at paragraph 1 on top of the page.     No.    Absolutely and perhaps it is instructive from this why they misunderstood what was going on or that is.     A possible reasonable explanation.     Because they saw the report and the changes in the report and the omission of certain aspects of the r eport, their opinion as evidence.    Yes.    (No audible reply).    [Intervenes].    That is correct Chair.    Yes sir.    The changes according to Khuba, to Khuba as I said earlier is based on in terms of his analysis what was removed was no of evidentiary value and served no real purpose according to him for the changes at that stage.     Chair to answer your question I think I now understand your earlier question.     On this issue which perhaps I did not answer correctly.    Or specifically to answer your question.  There are a number of reports.    Which start from perhaps what I am  aware of is 2013, October.    Then it changes in November.    Because things are added or and.    It is sent to Mosing, sent back.    By the time it comes to January, the 22 n d the so called first report.    It has already had some evolution in it.     Because of the discussion between Mosing and Khuba.    And their working together.    And presumably acquiring.    For the statement.    So it will be between Khuba and Mosing.    And perhaps Moukangwe.    It is in a period where Sesoko was forbidden to be part of the  process.    And it is in a period where I had not arrived yet at IPID/    So it is between Khuba, Mosing and Moukangwe.    Who would know exactly who and I do not know if they will be able to recall after so many years who changed what when and the rationale for it.  In that report that became now – is now known for sake of convenience as the first report and I am not sure what the Minister means by the original report in his term of reference.     Absolutely.    That is that is correct.  An example off the top of my head was that some stuff of the so called first report would be repeated in the second report.     But some qualification added on to it.     To say this can no longer be the case because we have not proven X, Y and Z.  For example I remember a success report.  Did the success – someone sent a success report to amongst others General Dramat.    And therefore from the information that was available then without the benefit of analysis and review was at somehow by sending the report to Dramat he therefore knew something was going on.    It later transpired that it is not even clear whether the report was actually sent.  There is an electronic copy on someone’s computer but whether it was actually sent or not is not, is not known.  Whether it was actually received and whether it w as actually read and whoever – if he had knowledge of it was, was of any consequence at all of the arrest.    The success report is to the arrest.     For me my understanding is that there was a change at all to the first and that anything [intervenes].     The obsession with Werksmans the Minister and all the advisors was that there was a change of the first report and they elevated the first report to a status which logically it could not enjoy and that it was inviable.  It can never change unde r any circumstances.    Ja.    That is correct yes.    Absolutely none.    That is correct yes.    From the evidence and from the affidavits and from engagement Mr Khuba is on record as saying he sent a draft at some stage in 2014 to Mr  Sesoko’s computer and it is on that draft whatever it was whether it was the same a correspondent to the first report or not they worked on that draft and that is where there were changes.  If I would say that the second report is perhaps an enhancement on the facts or emphasis that was contained in the first report.  So that is all I can say.  I am not sure what transpired between – to give rise to the existence of the first report and whatever changes took place there.    And what was in the first report at the stage when I co-signed with Khuba and Sesoko and now known as the second report.    I do not know.    Ja.    Thank you Chair.  In fact when the Minister requested all of this information both reports were given to the Minister.    So there was no attempt to mislead the Minister by only showing one, one report.     Both reports are with the bundle that was sealed and given to the Minister on 26  November 2014.    That is correct.    Which Chair is indeed what Khuba proceeded to do to review everything that was there at that stage and the relative evidentiary value.  The way it – it can never stand up in court now that all the facts are – it could never ever based on – of the shenanigans that took place before it arrived at IPID in any event.      That is correct yes.    That is correct yes.    That is correct.    That is correct, yes.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    No.    On my understanding it would be a conscience decision not to include after review anything that was of no evidentiary value.    And if somehow non-evidentiary value quotations crept in initially there was a conscience decision not to include them, but in any event whatever was there in the first report was known because it was included with the package given to Minister Nhleko and there was no attempt to hide anyt hing or remove it for ulterior motives or anything like that.  I cannot take it much further than that.    Chair the way you put it now would be accurate is what I expect would have happened.     I do not expect that they would have started a report from scratch.    When there are some objective facts.     That do not affect it either way.    I would prefer if we did not have to.     Yes.  In addition Chair there is an aspect in terms of the first affidavit which I signed.     Which we have not consulted on yet.     And which means it is unlikely even tomorrow.    That we will finish.    And it is quite important, but I have not discussed it with.    Mr Pretorius.    Advocate Pretorius yet.    But I am - in the back of my mind it is there.    And it has been submitted last year to the.    Commission.    It would not inconvenience me.    The key issue is they are discussing Section 204.  That line before that says Section 4, but.     Ja.  It is when an accomplice witness testifies against his, his co perpetrators as it were.  Now what is b eing offered and what has been explained is that by Khomo is you will be the 4 and Mahlangu is saying I will be a useless 204 because I do not know anything about those questions that were posed to me.  Referring to some previous occasion which, which th ey can explain directly what it is and Khomo’s position is regardless of whether you know about the questions or not and in – so then the subject is changed about where he is driving but the issue is regardless of whether you know or not you will get promoted and obviously the other witness - Mr Mahlangu - would have to give context to that directly, what it meant or what it could only have meant or whether it could mean anything else.  Maybe there is an innocent explanation for it.     Well Chair there was an attempt to do that when the Mabula Team actually charged and I am sure we will get to it later.  Paul O’Sullivan, Sarah Trent, Binang one of the lead investigators and Mr  Mahlangu.    No I was not charged.    No, no I was not there at all.  I think when we consulted I covered that.    No, I was not there on the scene where they were charged and what he is discussing is the strategy to now include me also because now I am going down as the charge from entering premises evolves and snowballs  and miraculously becomes racketeering later on.    No, I was not.  I was not [intervenes].     Yes.    Yes Chair.  I am good.    That is right.    I am not sure whose laptop they are looking for.  I assume it is Mr  Sesoko’s in the context of the discussion.    Chair let me, let me answer this question because it needs a proper answer not that and I should be less reticent to just say it as it is.  All of this is a ruse to start a sham  investigation against IPID to scupper the Phahlane investigation.  That is what all of this is about.  This is a plan hatched how to counter IPIDs investigation.  That in essence that is it.  It is nothing, it is nothing else.  They can come and explain m aybe if they have an innocent explanation.  In the context of what took place in litigation between ourselves as IPID and the Phahlane Team and Mabula Team who in any case are suspects and the two judgments of Prinsloo and Stockton forbids this counter inv estigation to take place.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct yes.    Yes and also in the middle of the page when Khomo speaks about or Mr  Mahlangu speaks about Mr Sesoko he    Yes Chair.  I am on page 1564 in the middle.    That is.    On 1564 he is mentioned.    And the importance of that Chair is    It says.    Chair just in terms of – this is not unlike the hullabaloo about the rendition.     Ja.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Yes that is correct.    The only person I am not sure is Prince who they are referring to and I cannot work out even when I heard the recording who Prince is.  So I am not, I am not sure who that is but.     Trent.   She was charged initially with Mahlangu and Binang and O’Sullivan.     Yes.  So Mr Nkabinde is a person who was also approached at some stage to change his evidence and when he refused to own up to it he was kicked off the Task Team.  I am just going through it quickly and then made complaints to the present Minister of Police after being kicked off the Task Team an d then Binang was one of the initial accused of the counter investigation which was conducted by General Mabula and his team.  In fact it becomes even worse.  Binang and it was a subject of [indistinct] judgment.  Binang was investigating General Mabula and his team for a range of tortures spanning - some of the tortures date back to 2006, 2010 and some of the team of General Mabula appeared in court in 2012.    Ja.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is right.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And then against line 15 you are asked a question by Mr  July, what was that question?      And your answer?     You don’t have to go on because that’s not entirely central to the questions that we need to deal with.  At the bottom of page 892 you make a remark concerning your knowledge, at least at the time about whether you would see each and every report or whether the Executive Director would see each an d every report that goes through to the NPA, would you just explain the position then, I’m referring to your statement at line 22.      Alright.  You – what is the position with reports, is it true that on occasion Provincial Heads in IPID would send reports directly to the NPA without them going past you?     I must say I didn’t when we dealt with the statutory requirements di dn’t understand the statutory, to make that distinction between Provincial and National Report, it seemed to be a blanket provision that all reports to the NPA and I presume that means final decisive reports, must go through the Executive Director, that’s as I read the statute, but perhaps I’m wrong and perhaps you can correct me.     We will just check that.  Then on page 893 you deal with further material before Werksmans in regard to your knowledge of what reports provisional or otherwise had gone through to the NPA and at line 5 ...(inte rvention)      Alright but the overall duty to refer or to ensure that referral takes place I suppose possible to read into 74 is that of the Executive Director?      And the regulations which appear at page 62 talk of the investigation of criminal matters, that’s 62 of Exhibit YH.  The investigation must be done in accordance with regulation 5, the Executive Director or the relevant Provincial Head     Right.      In any event quite separately from that you were making two points to Werksmans, in fact in accordance with your evidence more but the two principal points for the moment were that you weren’t aware of an original or provincial report?      At that stage.     So you became aware later.       The second point you make is that at the time you received your report from Khuba in January of 2014 you were satisfied that the investigation was not complete.      Sorry March 2014, that was when the report was made, my error.  Then in paragraph, well the first paragraph on page 893 from line 5 what did you say to Werksmans?      Yes.     Then again you are asked a question at line 7, what was that, of page 894?      Aside from the logic in that question just continue.     And then your answer?    We will see what Khuba said in due course and if necessary hear Mr Khuba, but the logic is open ...(intervention)     ...at least on the face of it to question.    You just for reference purposes Chair you deal with this at page 1018 at one of your affidavits where you say in the court application, to which we’ve referred at paragraph 32, to avoid overburdening the papers in this matter I do not attach copies of the full transcripts of the interviews conducted by Werksmans with Khuba, Sesoko and Mosing, I attach only the pages that I re fer to in this affidavit and then you offer to provide the full transcript to the    YC correct Chair, paragraph 34.    1020.    No 1020 Chair.    Reference is made to what Mosing said in his interview with Werksmans but can you recall from your own memory of reading the transcript, we’re going to check the transcripts now and there may be a discrepancy between what is said here and what Mr Mosing said and we are checking that and we will deal with it after the tea adjournment but you say in paragraph 34 here    Was it not an earlier October report that Mosing was referring to?       To get back to your replying affidavit and your critique of the Werksmans’ report, we have dealt with a number of issues both in detail as regards to the particular submissions or contents of the interviews as well as your high level critique of the fact that there was an inv estigation by Werksmans at all under the direction of the Minister.  Your critique is recorded at page 17 and following of the replying affidavit, it’s a matter of record.  Is there anything you wish to add to that?      But to put it at its highest you were critical of the content of the report, the analysis of the evidence and the outcome of the report, is that correct?      Chair I don’t know if you require us to go into further detail on that, it may become relevant later as matters progress but then we can address it then but to go into it page by page analysis of all the evidence, all the detail, I think will not be productive at this stage.     If, just for the sake of completeness we could then go to Bundle YD – yes YD at page 1443 and subject to any need that might arise for a more in -depth and complete analysis we can end here to repeat the finding and comment on it para 645 of the Werksmans report.      Yes of Exhibit YD.     You’ve explained to the Chair that an analysis was done, and we’ve referred to Mr Khuba’s evidence in that regard with the assistance of Mr Sesoko, because we now know that Mr Sesoko was assisting for  the first time, he had been excluded in relation to the first report.     What if it is put to you that the deletion of the information was deliberately calculated to mislead the recipient of the report or the second report?      Yes and that Mr Khuba makes clear because he consulted with Mr Sesoko and they can come and give their evidence about that.     Right, thirdly you say that had you not done the work in relation to the investigation that resulted in the production of the second report, you would have been acting improperly and unlawfully.     You’ve already made it clear to the Chair in that regard that as far as IPID is concerned that although it makes its own comments and gives its own opinion the duty on the prosecutor to determine the fate of a persons, whether they should be charged or no would be, obviously to examine the full contents of the docket and those were never tampered with.      Finally if I could just ask you to look at – and I mean finally for this aspect of the evidence at p age 1152 of Bundle YC, you will recall that the attitude of the Minister the attitude of those that took IPID to task including yourself was the first report somehow had a status that could not be tampered with it appeared that, that might have been well t he motivation of Werksmans and making its recommendations but would you look at 1152 please.      This is a communication from the Director of Public Prosecutions Gauteng Local Division, a Mr Roberts SC.     It’s dated the 23 r d of April 2015, almost a year after the second report was filed.      That would have been who at the time?     Right, it says in paragraph 1, “the following further investigatio n must be taken or must be done before a decision can be taken”, and then there are a number of sub -paragraphs which talk about an expert analysis of cell phone data in relation to Major General Sibiya in relation to his alleged presence at the crime scene, it talks about transcript of sms messages sent or received by Lieutenant Colonel Malaleke, Major General Sibiya and Lieutenant General Dramat during the period of the operations.  It talks about further cell phone records and on page 1153 is a long list of other matters to be investigated.  The letter concludes at paragraph 2 on page 1154, “the matter must be regarded as urgent as the investigation must be completed on or before 12 May 2015”.  So that it seems that despite everything and despite all the a llegations and evidence including those that led to your suspension and criminal charges being laid against you that even on 23 April 2015 the investigation was hardly complete.      On the moment – for the moment rather the letter seems to indicate that further investigations were necessary before a prosecutorial decision could be made but you add the concern that cer tain information may have been removed from the docket but the best person to comment on that would be Mr Khuba I presume?     In paragraph 44 you repeat aspects of your critique  in relation to the report and you then talk about...(intervention).     Back to the statement sorry, paragraph 44 on page 9 of Exhibit YA.  You talk about the costs to the state of the whole rendition saga and you estimate the cost to the state to being in the region of 17million rand according to a reply to a parliamentary question put to the Minister in 2017, is that correct?      You were suspended for what period of time?    Right in broad summary what did you find on your return in relation to issues relating to restructuring, transfers, dismissals and appointments?  Don’t go into the detail yes we’re going to go into the detail but just to introduce this topic in a line or two.     IPID and you?     Let’s perhaps change the focus of debate to a higher level and I don’t mean  any (indistinct) judgement on the debate that’s taken place but what you deal with now is in fact what happened as a result of the whole rendition saga and the manner in which it was handled, leave aside whether it was dealt with properly or not you’ve given your evidence but you now tell the Chair of the outcome the demise of certain officials, the changes in personnel in the IPID and of other consequences that occurred as a result of the manner in which the rendition saga was handled.  Firstly let’s go t o paragraph 50, what post did Mr Sesoko hold prior to his suspension as a result of the renditions investigation?      Did he support your application to challenge the Constitutionality of certain sections of the IPID Act and other sections when you challenged your susp ension?     Right when was he suspended, do you recall?     And he was also charged with altering what we now refer to as the first report, is that correct?      Well look at line 5 – 4 & 5 of paragraph 50 of your statement. Remember that Werksmans made a recommendation that you and Sesoko as well as Khuba be charged because they didn’t know who did what?      No I don’t want to get caught in the same terminology and to give any validity to the substance of the charge but what was the nature of the charge against Mr Sesoko?      Right leave aside whether that charge was properly formulated in the light of the evidence and questions that have now transpired in your evidence here, that was the nature of the charge, correct?  In fact the charge reflected the views of Werksmans and the Minister in relation to the fact that there was one report that was the final report and you couldn’t actually do anything about that through later investigation or analysis, correct?      Who came in as the acting Executive Director under your suspension?      Alright now before you go on, tell the Chair briefly, there will be evidence to follow your evidence, but very, very briefly what was the Panday case all about?      General Booysen?     Right and did IPID then do some work in relation the case?      Right you tell the Chair that your successor or acting successor called for that file or case?      We will deal with that in more detail but was that case ever put on the Court role for prosecution?      Involving police officials?      Right just before we continue, you have told the Chair that the case file was requested by your acting successor Mr Kgamanyane and that, as I understand your evidence, there has not been a successful prosecution, despite your view that there is evidence on file?      Could we put it another way, no case involving the issues to which you’ve just referred has been finalised.     And then you refer to other IPID investigation files that were requested and you mentioned Major General Mabula and is it General Ntlemeza?      After your suspension?     Who was the official within IPID who was dealing with all these cases, Panday, Ntlemeza, Mabula and the like?     Right, we get now at notionally to paragraph 51 of your statement but I don’t want to deal with it now, I need to intervene Chair to deal with a matter that has received considerable publicity and to clarify from our point of view what we understand the position to be notwithstanding what has appeared in the press.  To take a step back Mr McBride made certain comments in his statement in regard to the findings of your younger broth er Advocate Mxolisi Zondo in relation to the disciplinary hearing of Mr Sesoko, not his disciplinary hearing Mr Sesoko.      In his statement Mr McBride expresses a very narrow opinion of what occurred at that enquiry in relation to sick notes submitted to Advocate Zondo on Mr Sesoko’s behalf and whether these should or shouldn’t be taken into account, there’s an opinion expressed.  When this matter was raised before you at the beginning it was stressed to you t hat there’s a record, that the record is complete and comprehensive, the record involves, not Mr McBride but another witness and any assessment of that record can, in due course be made by whomever might be appropriate. In relation to those circumstances, really what Mr McBride can or cannot say amounts to no more than an opinion and doesn’t really count for anything other than Mr McBride’s view.  Presented to you was a comprehensive piece of research and documentation prepared on behalf of the legal team. That was the only written submission you had before you, it was placed before you and never detracted from because I recall saying at the very end, that when this matter comes to be considered finally, we will deal with the issues and the report presented to you or the submissions presented to you rather would remain intact and relevant and as I understand it you accepted that at some state you would reconsider or consider all those elements in that report or those submissions placed before you on behalf of  the legal team. Now I – in order to allow the evidence to proceed I intervene to say, well it’s an opinion it’s no more than an opinion you could hear that and in due course you could make a decision in regard to your attitude towards this and other evidence and that was where it rested.  I might have said I was speaking on behalf of the legal team, I did say that all the views were not...(intervention).      Yes that’s what I said and I took it upon myself to offer a way through, I didn’t purport to change what the legal team had said, in fact it remained (in distinct) before you and I think you understood it...(intervention).      Yes but I did offer a way forward for which I take full responsibility and that was because of the nature and extent of the evidence because there’s a full and comprehensive record it’s not necessary for you to make any final decision now, you can make a decision later and to hear the opinion of an individual who was not directly involved in a factual basis would not detract from any decision that you might make in the future but the situation has now become more complicated Chair.      So Chair before we get to the complication, in the light of the various press reports, all of which I’ve not read and may not be accurate , just to summarise McBride originally intended to express an opinion on someone else’s disciplinary enquiry and the circumstances prevailing in that enquiry that there is a written record upon which any informed judgment can be made in due course, that’s not before you save perhaps in some annexure where the ruling of Mr Zondo exists that in order not to delay proceedings unduly it was decided as an interim measure and pending any decision you make, after hearing representations, not only from other profes sional bodies but also from the President’s office you mentioned, you will make a final decision and that it would not affect that process if you merely had reference or heard the opinion in relation to those facts of Mr McBride but the situation has now – oh and also the submissions of the legal team remain before you for your consideration, unaltered and those were the only written submissions before you.  The situation has become a little bit more complex now because we were informed this weekend, Chair, that Mr Booysen also wishes to make reference to an enquiry in which Mr Zondo presided or didn’t – may not have continued I don’t know the full facts and the extent to which the enquiry continued or didn’t continue but it involved General Booysen himself so it’s direct and Mr Sesoko may come to give evidence, again he will give evidence which is direct as opposed to opinion.  In that – in the light of that, and I’ve discussed it with Mr McBride perhaps everything, opinion and everything else should be pend ed, pending a full consideration of all the evidence together to see what to do because I would imagine that the evidence of Mr Sesoko, which is direct and the evidence of General Booysen which is also direct will be decisive of this issue rather than what Mr McBride might or might not have to say and Mr McBride is quite willing, I understand, and he can confirm it, to pend his evidence in relation to paragraph 51 of his statement until further notice.      So just for clarity sake because one doesn’t know how this will be understood by the media there was little prejudice to the overall process still to be considered by yoursel f by hearing the opinion indirectly of Mr McBride. We have subsequently learnt that there are at least two pieces of direct evidence that deal with the same matter which really overtakes the consideration of Mr McBride and in relation to that it requires f ull and comprehensive consideration for a decision by yourself on the strength of, amongst other things, the submission the legal teams have made to you.     You then returned to office?     What happened to Mr Sesoko?     Alright.  You say at paragraph 53 Mr McBride on page 11 of your statement 11 of Exhibit Ya that you made a certain discovery or observation on your return to office in relation to the statistical performance of IPID as it had been reported in your absence.  What is your evidence in that regard?     Docket investigating a particular police official?    You have a duplicate file implicating the same person on the same investigation?     So the two are in essence copies of each other?    And the other is also withdrawn because it had a duplicate?     So both disappear?    Yes.  But to – you deal with that later in your evidence.  To deal with the general point you make in paragraph 53 how was the performance of IPID in your absence reported including to Parliament?     Was this accurate?    Alright.  So in summary in your absence after the change of leadership.     In IPID it was reported you say falsely that the performance had improved.  This was a device that was used or there was a device used to manipulate statistics to achieve an apparent result which was not an accurate result?     Alright.    Okay.  In summary what has happened is that the leadership of a Law Enforcement Agency institution or a government institution is removed and replaced by other leadership.  It is then reported that under the new leadership performance has improved.  Is this occurrence unique to IPID at around the time?    Before you go there we will deal with that in due course in the following paragraph.     Dealings with the Rendition Report?    Did he also submit an affidavit on your behalf and your court challenge to your suspension?     Tell the Chair about that please.     The emphasis in paragraph 56 of your statement Mr McBride is som ewhat different where you say he was dismissed after he refused to falsely implicate yourself and Sesoko and upon his refusal he was dismissed with immediate effect.  I understand you to say now that no the real reason for his dismissal was a contradiction between his contents of his plea bargain and his supporting affidavit to you.    Let us deal with 57 then.  Thank you.    Alright before we go on with the leave of the Chair we want to play the recording  if we may?  It is very brief.    And there is a transcript    May I just say and ask the witness.  The recording is an isolated communication that happened after a series of communications, a series of visits you say?     The point I wish to make is that one can only understand the full import of the transcript and the telephonic recording if one understands all that p receded it?    So – and you will point this out to the Chair after hearing the recording.     The recording has been transcribed I am told not instructed Chair I am told accurately.      And it is in bundle D, Exhibit Yd at page 1456.  Is that right?     Sorry Chair do you have a question?    Sorry hold it.  I am sorry Chair.     I am informed Chair of two things.  I am not a linguistic expert Chair by any means but I informed  that the language is used are a combination of Setwana Sesotho and perhaps Sepedi as well and I am also…     I am also informed that – I am sorry Chair.    Some English yes.  That I did understand.    Chair the – I am also informed that the transcript is an accurate transcript.  That may be subject to debate in the future.    But perhaps we should have it officially transcribed.    In due course but for the moment my information is that it is safe to proceed on the basis of  the translation contained at paragraph – at page rather 1459 in Exhibit Yd.      Well 1458 it begins but the…     The parts that we will seek to place on record are at page 1459 and following.     But let us just place this telephone conversation in its proper context please Mr…      Thank you Chair.  Mr McBr ide at page 1458 is a translation of the transcript, or the transcript of the telephone conversation that we have just heard.  I don’t want to go into too much detail because Mr Khuba can give original evidence as to what happened in the telephone call.      And if the Chair is to rely on any evidence finally it will be that of Mr Khuba.      What this shows for pre sent purposes to place it into context and into the context of your evidence is that on the face of it Mr Khuba was offered or promised a promotion if he cooperated?     Yes, the later transcript will deal with the offer of a promotion, am I correct, or is that someone else?     Yes, alright so for the present the offer is that his job will be restored provided certain action is taken by him?     Right, to support General Ntlemeza is friend and not to support his enemies?      And this will be placed into full context once we have evidence of the full sequence of interactions  between Colonel Mahlangu on the one hand and Mr Khuba on the other.      Then it’s hearsay for the moment but Mr Khuba will come to testify to the extent that it may be put in dispute but what do you say in paragraph 58 in relation to a communication between General Ntlemeza and Mr Khuba?      Then Mr McBride from what you say and it must be common cause Mr Khuba has since been restored to his position through an order of the Labour Court.      In 2014?     And is it your evidence that the context of the statement you make in paragraph 58 is that General Dramat’s removal would facilitate General Ntlemeza’s career advancement?     Ja, well Mr Khuba will come and give that evidence.     Then I understand Mr McBride that you have time constraints and that if possible we should try and proceed with your evidence without detracting from its content too much as rapidly as possible..  I was informed that du ring the most recent break, am I correct?      Yes, okay no, thank you.       And you deal with the case of Felicia Ntshangase, the case of Nmkozi Netsayanda, the case of Mahoca, the Director of Litigation Services, the case of Moses Dlamini, the case of Mapachu, the Director Executive Support in the Office of the Executive Director and then you deal with restructuring the case of Vinesh Budu, Marianne Morwaswe, Suziwe Pale, Ndukule Qongo and Mamodishe Malope, all those cases, are you able to summarise generally what happened in this regard?  The detail is there in your statement, the Chair has your statement, it’s on record, what do you say about firstly the restructuring or transfer s or dismissals generally and secondly the period of time over which this took place and whether this took place and whether this was normal or abnormal?      What effect did these transfers and this restructuring have on the viability or ability to control IPID?      What happened to the person who was transferred to the Eastern Cape, would you tell the Chair about that?     Right.     Over what period of time did these transfers under this restructuring occur?  Was it months, days, weeks, years?     You refer in paragraph 75 to a report of the Auditor General dated 31 March 2016, was this a report of occurrences within IPID and the performance of IPID during the period of your suspension?     The report appears in Exhibit Yd at page 1464 and there’s an extract at page 1475, paragraph 27, if you could place that on record p lease.     D, small letter d, Exhibit Yd, page 1464 is the first page of the Auditor General Report and the extract is at paragraph 27 of 1475, if you could just place that on record please.     Right, just read that onto the record please, and comment if you will.      Is that the passage to which you wished to refer the Chair?     You returned to office you say in your statement at paragraph 76 on the 19 t h of October 2016?    And you requested a handover report?    Did you receive such a report from Mr Kgamanyane?    Your requests for a report on his response are in the bundles, do you need to refer to them?     The communication we’ve just referred to and that is Mr Kgamanyane’s response to your request for a handover report is dated the 27 t h of October 2016 and it appears at page 1554 of Exhibit Yd, would you mind going there please and just tell the Chair very briefly if there’s anything in that you believe bears emphasis.     1554.    That reply should be read in the context of your request at 1552.    Where you said in paragraph 3 the Exco has directed that the follow ing aspects should be covered in your presentation.    What were you seeking to establish or find out about?     Alright, I’m not sure that it’s necessary to go into any detail, but did you receive a cooperative response, and I’m referring to page 1554 .    And you say the response you received was to put it mildly not entirely helpful?     Right, can we go please to page 18 of Bundle YA, your statement, at paragraph 77.  Is it correct that Mr Kgamanyane faced disciplinary action for what occurred in IPID during his period of control?    Do you know what happened to that matter?    Yes.    Alright, let’s go then to the next topic you deal with on page 18, and that’s the infiltration of IPID by Crime Intelligence.  You’ve told the Chair that during the period of your suspension three members of Crime Intelligence became employed within IPID.    Would you like to comment in that regard?    Let’s take t hat step by step because you’ve just given a lot of evidence in a very short period of time.  The first point that y ou make in paragraph 78 is that Gommo and others during your suspension became employed by IPID.      Shortly after your return went back to Crime Intelligence.    It is at page 1557 Chair.    Again the full import of this recording can only properly be understood when direct evidence is given as to its contents and Mandla Mlongo in order to place it before the Chair would have to give direct evidence as to what occurred d uring the telephone conversation.    And what preceded and subsequently occurred after the conversation?     And as a party to the conversation Mandla Mhlongo can also give evidence as to the circumstances under which the recording was made.     Right that is all to…     So it is a matter of public record already is it?    Right.  Just ask that it be played.  Chair this transcript which shows the words in the original language used and then the translation follows.     Could you play it please.  Sorry before you start playing.  The transcript refers to a person by the name well not by then name by the title of male, m -a-l-e, who is that?    Okay.  Would you play it please?  [LISTENING TO RECORDING]    No it continues I am told.    Thank you.  Once again we will check the translation Chair.    I say that provisionally because I do not have the final agreement but we will endea vour to place it before Chair.    The second point perhaps this should be dealt with you by – dealt with by you Mr McBride.  The telephone conversation appears to have taken place on the 21 June 18 that is sometime after your return to IPID, after your suspension, is that correct?    Right at that time …     Well the heading to the recording says 21 June 2018 I presume that can be independently checked by our own investigators.    That may also be correct.    Yes we will come to that.    You say this could have happened in 2017?    In any event – what position did you occupy at the time?     After your return from suspension?    Mr Mlongo what position did he occupy at the time?    With IPID?    Alright.  When you say sensitive investigations can you name one or two?     Alright.      Right and Mr Gomo what position did he occupy at the time?     Had he gone back to Crime Intelligence by this time?     By the time of – yes that is correct Chair.  At the time of him making that phone call he was in Crime Intelligence.    Including General Phahlane.    Alright.    Firstly from what you have testified about the independence of IPID regardless of the detail should a conversation of this type ever have take n place between a senior official in Crime Intelligence and an investigator in IPID?     Yes we know that.  But my point – we will get to the content in a moment.  My point is that this is a senior officer in Crime Intelligence talking about job offers to a person in IPID who is doing investigations into members of the police force.     Yes.    Yes I am – I am just dealing with a different point apart from the content and that is that this is Crime Intelligence talking to IPID.    Alright.  Let us go to the content then.    And I will return to the question later.  It appears that at page 1558 and following and in summary the discussion takes place and it may even be termed an offer on closer examination of a post for Mr Mlongo, is that correct?     Now in relation to the post occupied at the time by Mr Mlongo would this have been a promotion, would it have been a transfer at the same level of seniority, what is the position?    So we know then that the two in the conversation are discussing a substantial promotion and a transfer.  If we can go then to page 1561 Mr Mlongo says but look is this not favouritism or corruption of some sort, will it not be viewed like that?  And the answer is, no, no that is nothing to do with corruption you resign at IPID and then you work where you like.     You do not need to comment.    Apparent on the face of it or its lack of validity.  But what I would like to do is ask you about what you know of the conversation at the bottom of p age 1561.  In other words on the one hand there is talk of a transfer or a termination of employment and reemployment at a much more senior level.  That is what we have established so far.    Then in the context firstly of what appears on the face of it at least to be an offer of a senior position in Crime Intelligence.  Secondly in the context of a conversation where the Exec utive Director that is you is quote “going down”.  Evidence is then discussed in the middle of page 1562 where
