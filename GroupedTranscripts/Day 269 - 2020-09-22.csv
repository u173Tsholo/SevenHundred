CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.      Are we ready?    Okay.  Mr Mokhesi the oath you took yesterday continues to apply today okay?  Alright.    In paragraph 19?    What was the answer Mr Mokhesi?    Ja.  Okay.    Mr Mokhesi you say the officials were not forthcoming.  But you knew who was the HOD at the time did you not ask the HOD even if he was out of the department?    No he never – he would not tell you if you did not ask him.  Did you ask him?    Why not?  He was the HOD.  He was in charge of the department.  You wanted to know how these contractors got appointed.  Why did you not ask him?  He was the most obvious person to ask.  Why did you not write to him?  Why did you not phone him and say; Mr Mokoena you were the HOD when this mess happened who selected these people?  Why did you ask – limit your enquiries to junior officials when you knew who was the HOD at the time?    Do you mean you took a conscious decision not to ask the person who was HOD.    Hm.      Yes.    Yes but why did you not ask the most obvious person namely the HOD at the time?  Because the fact that he might not have been in the department did not mean you could not ask him.  It did not mean you could not phone him.  It did not mean you could not direct a letter to him to say I want to know who made this decision because you were the HOD at what was the basis for the decision.    Ja but I want to know why you did not ask because it seems so obvious to me that a new HOD who finds this kind of mess would ask the previous HOD.        And you do not why you did not ask?    Well we will see when all the evidence is in Mr Mokhesi but I am just surprised.  One gets the impression that whatever investigation was being done within the department was not done with the vigour that one would have expected when so much of taxpayers’ money seems to have been lost.      Sorry?    Yes.    But if you could ask Mr Mokhesi if you could ask the junior officials why could you not ask the HOD of the time?  The fact that there was an on-going investigation did not prevent you from asking the junior officials why did it prevent you from asking the HOD.    Was it only the previous HOD that the SIU said was not cooperating or did it also say the same thing about some of the officials?    But you know – you see you are saying to me that letter from the SIU gave you justification for not asked the previous HOD.  But from what you are saying the SIU letter also said the officials were also not cooperating.  But you did ask the officials but you did not ask the HOD.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Well I want to add this Mr Mokhesi.  I go back to an issue I raised with you yesterday.  Well at some stage I was saying I got the impression you were – or you did not want to be categorical on certain issues but you were not in a position to tell me yesterday as to how many houses or – had been built by the end of the financial year?  How many houses had been built by the time – by October 2010?  And yet we are in 2020.  If you were really interested to establish certain important facts about this, I do not understand why knowing that you were going to come and give evidence about this you would not know that.  To say the department paid so much money but there were only 100 houses that had built to completion; ex number of houses were only built up to the wall; so many it was only foundation and when you look at all of that it could not have cost more than this.  Therefore, so much money was just wasted.  I could not understand why you could not have that information at hand.    Yes.    No, no, no I accept that you should not say anything you are not sure about and you still should not say you are sure.  But what I am saying is when you come give to evidence here as Head of the Department about this project it seems to me that you do not need to be told what questions you are going to be asked to know    Ja okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.  Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.    Well you did say that Mr Mokhesi to be fair to you and it is in accordance with my expectation that a new Accounting Officer would not just look at what happened when he or she came in but would look at – at what had happened before because the duty to rectify whatever mess happened before would be on him or her.  So when you say you account even for that it is in line with what I would expect namely you come in; you want to see what is the state of the department.  You see what has happened; you see what has gone wrong; you devise a way of rectifying those things even though they happened before your time.  So I am just saying to be fair to you; you made that point yesterday and it is in line with my expectation of what a new Accounting Officer would do.  Okay.    Mr Mokhesi the question is a simple one.  Do you have knowledge as to who ...[intervenes]      You do not have knowledge.     You do not?     Okay alright.     The first thing that you do?     Yes.     Who is giving instruction.     Unlawful.     I am sorry Mr Mokhesi, I did not hear that.     You have never seen it before?     Oh.     Okay, okay.     I am sorry.  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Mr Mokhesi, just take it easy.  Listen to the questions carefully and answer them to the best of your ability.   The question is simply whether you or somebody else under your instructions ever conducted investigations into those two questions?       Were there... let us break the question into two.  Did you yourself conduct any investigations into the two questions he has raised?     So you asked ...[intervenes]      Investigation.     Be investigated.     Okay.     Not specific ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Okay.  Mr Pretorius.     I am sorry Mr Pretorius.     Mr Pretorius, I think there is something wrong maybe with the... well, the aircon is not making any noise but you cannot hear me sometimes when I call you.  So maybe I will have to speak louder.     [laughing]  But... no, I wanted to say, you were saying that Mr Mokoena was of the view that the MEC had instructed.  But I wanted to say, it does not say that he was of the view.  He clearly says he was... they were instructed by the MEC.     Yes.  I just wanted to correct that.       That Mr Mokoena ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Ja.     Yes, ja.     Ja.     Yes.     But you at least... should you not at least take steps to establish whether... what version you are told by the person who is alleged to have given the instructions and then see whether in your mind you have any doubt which version is true?  Should you not at least take that step?   Because if both version and you happen to think that you believe the version of the one says he was instructed, you may want to take certain steps to enforce accountability in ways that do not involve disciplinary action but there may be other ways.     But you do know Mr Mokhesi that it is going to be very rare for you... for somebody to reduce to writing and unlawful instruction that he knows to be unlawful.  So you will find a document.  But does that mean that nothing will ever be done because that person...[intervenes]      No, no, no.  Let us not talk at the same time.     I will give you a chance.  So does that mean that as long as the instructions are verbal, nothing ever will be done because there is nothing in writing?  MR     Sorry?     Who are you looking at now when you say he must live with the consequences?     Yes.  No, no, no.  That is... I think that is understood.     But are you saying, as long as you do not have a record then nothing ...[intervenes]      Mr Pretorius.     Well, you see Mr Mokhesi, for me the later it is when you deposed to this affidavit, the more time it means you have had to get to the bottom of everything and to get all the answers you wanted.  If this thing happened in 11 by, and you wanted answers maybe of the financial year at the end of March 2011.     And you wanted answers by end of April, somebody could say this time is just too short for us to do a proper investigations.   So by end of April, you are not going to have answers to all the questions because more time is needed in order to give you answers to all the questions.  It will give you answers to some of the questions but not all the questions.   But when you are talking nine years later, seven years later, if you had used the time available, you wanted to use the time to get answers.  You have had all the time in the world.   You do not have to investigate in 2016 when you are deposing to this affidavit.  You should have investigated a number of years earlier and got all the answers to the questions that naturally arose in this matter.  You understand my thinking?     H’m?     You do not understand that?     Okay let me try and explain it again.  If something happens today and you want to investigate it and you say you want answers by the end of today, that time might be too limited to allow a thorough investigation.   If something happens today and you say you want answers by the end of the week, it may be that that time is too short for you to get all the answers because the investigators would need more time, okay?   But if you say, this thing that happened today must be investigated and you want answers in seven months’ time or at the end of the year, I am saying, the investigators would have had more time to investigate.   And therefore, chances that they will give you more answers to your questions or even all the answers to your questions are greater than when the time is shorter.       H’m.  You ...[intervenes]      Ja.  No, no.  It is important that you put your side as to what you did and if you believe you did it to the best of your ability.  That is important.  This is an inquiry.  We are probing certain things.   And the fact that you might not be able to answer a certain thing, it is one thing.  But we are probing to say, was this done?  If it was not done, why was it not done?   So you just answer to the best of your ability and where you believe that you were not required to do more than what you did, then feel free to say so.   But we are probing to see what was done, what was done, why was it not done.  And you just answer.  If you know why it was not done, you say this is the reason why it was not done.   And if it was done, you say it was done.  If it was done by somebody else and not you, you believe somebody else did it, then this is who did it.     You see, Mr Mokhesi.  You are the current head of the department or you followed after Mr Mokoena.  Is that right?     Ja.  You followed after Mr Mokoena.  By reason of that, one would expect certain things.  One would expect you to do certain things when you are arrived at the department and found what you found, okay.  And that has got to be looked into.   Yours is to just answer to the best of your ability.  There is no... it is not like as if you say something and we are not happy with it, we are just going to accept it.  That is not going to happen.   It will be probed and it is the right way that it should be probed.  But from your side, feel free at all times to put your side of the story so that when I look at all the facts, I will have your side of the story.     Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.     Okay, I am sorry, just repeat your answer?     That is the general – that is – your answer relates to the general but Mr Pretorius’ question is specific.     So if you answer that you do not know in terms of names or who made the decision as to who should be charged but there is a way of identifying who would have made a decision, who would have made that decision.     Because the question was who made the decision as to who [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes.     Okay, alright.  So the answer, Mr Pretorius is he made the decision.     Are you saying that at the time that you made the decision to go along with the recommendation to have certain people charged, at the time you made that decision, Mr – is it Tsoametsi, was no longer in the department?     Was he in another department within the same provincial government?     Sorry?     He was in Agriculture?     Did you ever bring to the attention of the HOD in Agriculture or the MEC, did you ever bring to their attention the fact that here was somebody who had devised a plan that had caused the department to lose a lot of money that they may need to look into because you could not discipline him anymore?  Did you bring that to the attention of his superiors in Agriculture to say the man that you have there used to be here where we – I would have charged him, I would have caused him to be charged with misconduct because we are charging people who were under him, junior ones, but he has gone, he is with you but I want you to be aware of this so that he can be held to account?     Well, when you made the decision, he was not a witness yet, is it not?  He became a witness when the hearing started when you made the decision …[intervenes]     But when any recommendation is made to you, including the recommendations that you are talking about, you are not meant to just rubber stamp, take them as they are and make your decision on the basis of them, you are supposed to satisfy yourself that they are sound, is it not?     Yes.  Now the information placed before you it seems should have indicated that he was the person who devised the plan.  Surely if that is what the information before you showed, surely you should have been concerned to say how are we going to charge only the people who carried out the instruction and not charge the person behind the whole plan?  Did you ask yourself that question?  In other words, it might be a wrong term but the kingpin.  How do we charge these – the real person who came up with this plan is the person who should be charged.  How do we not charge him but charge the others who carried out his plan?  Did you ask yourself that question?     So would you accept that you ought to have brought his role in the scheme or in this plan to the attention of his then superiors namely in the Department of Agriculture because it seems to me that a concern that you ought to have had would be if this person could do this in my department, he could do that in another government department.  They should at least know and see if they want to continue to employ a person who has played this role in this department which belongs to the same provincial government, it is not another provincial government, it is the same provincial government.     You accept that.  Okay, Mr Pretorius?     Yes, let us take the tea adjournment, we will resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Let us continue.     Well, you might confuse him, Mr Pretorius, by referring to labour law.  Maybe you should just ask – put the proposition whether it is fair to charge some and not others if they have all done the same thing.     Ja.     He wants you to comment if you are able to comment on that proposition.     Would you not regard it as unfair if two people have done the same thing to charge one and not the other?     You would?     Okay.     He is giving you a chance to comment on the proposition [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     You say it is.     Yes, did you also find it strange or do you not find it strange?     Let me ask this question.  At some stage did it appear to you that the then MEC Mr Zwane might not – might have played a role in this whole project that was not proper, not acceptable or did that – is that something that did not appear to you to be the case?     But with all the information that you were getting as the time went on from the time you came to the department, did you not get at some stage – did you not reach the conclusion that maybe this was something – his role should be reported to the Premier?     Yes.     Is your answer that you did not consider that it was your role to bring to the attention of the Premier the role that MEC Zwane appears to have played in this whole thing for him to decide what to do with the information?     Yes.     Yes.  So you would have to discuss with your MEC?     And then it would be up to him whether he took whatever information to the Premier.     Is that right?     Yes but did you discuss with your MEC the role that MEC Zwane seems to have played?     Ja, ja, ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Is your answer that you did not discuss these matters, MEC Zwane’s role with your MEC as such but there were reports …[intervenes]     That had been placed before her which, if she read, she would have known what role MEC Zwane [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes, okay.     Are we going back to his affidavit now?     Must I keep this other file that you were dealing with just now?     Or we can come back later?     Okay.  At some stage, Mr Pretorius, you were referring to the findings made by the Chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry.     Did you get to them or did I interrupt you and you ended up not getting to them?  The last paragraph I referred to was paragraph 89 on page 656 of FS19.     Yes, I think you were – I got the impression you wanted to refer to a finding that might have led to Mr Tsoametsi, but I may have misread what you had in mind.  As long as you have covered what you wanted to cover, it is fine.     So we are back to Mr Mokhesi’s affidavit at what page?     Okay, paragraph 98.     Not page?     I was wondering how we could go back so – to almost right at the beginning.     Ja, okay.     Well before you do that Mr Mokhesi I – it seems quite clear from your paragraph 107.2 that what was being done was to make misrepresentations of facts in order to create the impression that there was entitlement to payment of money or there was an obligation to pay money.       And what these cessions where it seems intended to create the impression as if there was cause for payment.       When actually there was no cause.      Yes, yes Mr Pretorius.       Paragraph 109 you said page 109 I think you mean paragraph.       Page 133 paragraph 109.      152?     Okay.      Have you got an estimate maybe in your mind of what percentage of the contractors and suppliers you are likely to get anything from?  I mean you said that the all or many of the contractors were put into a better place even those who were disqualified.             Some who had never built one RDP house were given a job to do - build 600 houses.  In terms of their financial muscle what are the chances that you are going to recover anything substantial from most of them?        Ja, ja.      But people who have been sued to try and recover money from are they limited to the contractors and suppliers of material or have you included officials and politicians who may have caused this situation by their conduct.            Yes.       It never got to the contractors.       Yes.   But my question is whether the department has also sued people who may have been in the department at the time.                In the department including politicians or their conduct that may have led to a lot of financial loss to the department?      That has not been done.      Ja, has it been raised as something that should be looked into within the department or its lawyers?      Okay, alright, yes Mr Pretorius.       Oh I also thought you said page 162.       So it is 152.      Okay.   ADV PRETORIUS     Page or paragraph?     Have you got any understanding why the criminal trials have not taking place arising out of all the investigations that have been done?  I see the disciplinary... the rulings, judgments in the disciplinary hearings, which were quite extensive and comprehensive, were completed in 15.   I think some people may have been judge at some stage, I am not sure.  Do you have any understanding and simply being the head of the department, you would have wanted to find out how the law enforcement agencies were proceeding or were progressing with the investigations and they would have told you.     How long ago was this understanding?     Would that be about 2013/2014?     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.  So nobody has been arrested or charged or anything?     Not to your knowledge?     H’m.  It is just that it is concerning because part of the complaints connected with allegations of state capture is that some of the law enforcement agencies were paralysed or did not do their job in regard to certain matters.   Of course, it may be that in this case they have done their job to the best of their ability given whatever resources they have and may be given the enormity of the job, I do not know, but it is concerning when the taxpayers have lost as much money as we are talking about here, you know.   And they lost it in 2010 and 2011 by the end of the financial year, the 2010/2011 financial year since March 11.   Now that is close to ten years and no arrests, nobody charged and yet, the taxpayers, on your estimate, at least lost about R 500 million or even more.   And ten years later there is nothing that the public knows that the department knows that gives confidence that something is being done.  That the matters are being given the urgent attention it deserves.   I mean, as I say the disciplinary hearings seems to have elicited a lot of information and quite comprehensive.  Your own affidavit was deposed to in December 2016.  2017, 18, 2019 – where next week, we are going to be October .   That is about four years since your very comprehensive affidavit was given and yet, nobody has been arrested, nobody has been charged.  It is quite concerning.   And of course, I have heard evidence in relation to PRASA for example, where also millions of rands were involved, where the chairperson of the board of PRASA, at a     Okay.  Thank you very much Mr Mokhesi for coming to give evidence. We appreciate it.  I know that we have not seen you for the last time because there is one evidence you still need to give in due course but thank you very much.  You are... I am not getting any indication that your counsel wishes to re-examine you or anything.       Thank you.  Thank you.  So you are excused Mr Mokhesi.  Thank you.       Yes.  You... maybe we should keep our resumption at two.     Yes Mr Pretorius are we ready?     Yes, please administer the oath or affirmation.     You may be seated Mr Mokoena.        Well the bundle will be referred to Bundles FS12, but we will admit each exhibit as and when we have to deal with it.   Mr Mokoena’s one is at what page     Yes okay, alright, once he has confirmed what he needs to confirm about it we will admit.     The bundle number will be on the spine of the file and I think he needs assistance.     I think let him just get settled, he is still trying to tidy things up in front of him.  Okay, alright.     So whenever you are referring to a page number Mr Mokoena just remember that that will be a reference to the black numbers at the top left corner of each page.     No FS you know, look at the top left corner you will see a black number starting with FS- maybe 12 and then -353, that 353 is the page number that Mr Pretorius is referring you to, ignore the FS and the 12, just focus on the last digits, the three digits.     I am sorry, do you want me to admit it Mr Pretorius?     The affidavit deposed to Mr Mpho Moses Mokoena appearing from page 336 to 353 of Bundle FS12 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit – is UU, UU3?     UU3, okay alright.     Maybe before he does so Mr Pretorius, what were your qualifications at the time you became HOD Mr Mokoena?     Yes, okay, thank you.      Sorry, sorry, try and look this side so I can hear your story so you – are you saying that the pressure that you felt which drove you to resign was that the Premier of the Province, Mr Magashule, was making announcements to the public that your department would build bigger houses than you were able to build or that you had funding for.      Okay Mr Pretorius.        Operation Hlasela?     Is that something you remember quite well or is it something that you are not sure about that as at October 2010 the Department had not built any houses under that project?     The service providers had not yet been appointed.     Who would have built the houses?     So obviously if no service providers had been appointed there could not be any houses built.     Is it possible that – well if you had used % of the budget allocation for that project and I understand that the budget was about R1.2 or R1.3million, billion, I’m sorry, billion, if you had spent 10% it seems that would have – that meant you must have spent less than R200million, just over R100million, is that right?     So there may have been foundations that had been built or erected but no houses would have been completed.     And you are sure about that?     Yes, now if the service providers had not been appointed who would have built the foundations, or erected the foundations?     Yes.     2010.     It was not on houses?     What was the 10% spent on, of the budget?     But it was not on the houses?     And you are sure about that?     Yes.     Is there any reason why whoever followed you, succeeded you as HOD, would not have found it easy to establish that simple fact that as at October no houses had been built, bearing in mind the information that would have been there, as far as you know, is there any reason why it would have been difficult for the next HOD to know that as at that time actually no houses at all had been built?     Yes, it should not be difficult, should not have been difficult?     And the fact that no suppliers had been – no service providers had been appointed before October 10 that also should have been easy to establish?     Yes, okay, alright.     I am sorry Mr Mokoena, you will have to raise your voice and as far as possible look this side as well, I know you have to look at the person who is putting questions to you but just raise your voice, I want to hear that story properly.     Yes, okay.     Ja, okay.      Or maybe – I am sorry Mr Pretorius, maybe briefly are you able to say why your department had not been able to build houses six months into the financial year, because by October that was six months into the financial year, why is it that you had not been able to build even one house, why was it that you had not appointed service providers on time, because you were the HOD.     And the period expired?     Yes.     Of course the failure to do whatever was necessary in order to make sure that by the time the tender period expired everything had been done, the failure to do that you must take responsibility, must you not, because you were the HOD?     Yes, okay.  Mr Pretorius?     And this was – was this in October when this meeting took place?     Okay.     Maybe, it may be that the other people who I assume were junior to you, were leaving it to you as head of department to ask Mr Zwane questions on the matter.   Isn’t that also a possibility?    Mr Pretorius?       I would like ...[intervenes]      Mr Pretorius I would him to finish telling me about that meeting who said what, how did it conclude before we move further.    Hm.    Before you go back to the board room is there anybody in the meeting other than yourself and Mr Zwane who spoke?  Did any other person speak …    Anything of substance?  Obviously, I am not talking about greeting.    Yes.  The others were …    Yes.  And you say the meeting ended on the basis that Mr Tsoa…    Yes was going to go and do some research about this solution?    And prepare a document – an internal document?    That would then be circulated?    Yes okay alright continue.     Well do you know that?  Because you said Mr Zwane did not want to disclose to you the identity of his advisor who gave him this advice and you are saying Mr Tsoametsi – Tsoametsi – is it Tsoametsi?    Ja you saying Mr Tsoametsi was his advisor but you are saying that the idea did not originate from Mr Tsoametsi; how do you know that?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    And research it ja.  But you do not know whether this might be an idea…    That came from him or not.    Okay.    So is that memorandum the document that Mr Tsoametsi produced pursuant to being asked by Mr Zwane to go and do research?    Okay.    I see from this document.    I see from this document that Mr Tsoametsi is described as Deputy Director General. Now you mentioned earlier on that he was an advisor or – to Mr Zwane.  I take it that you cannot be advisor to the MEC and be Deputy Director General, am I right?    But…    But …    The Department – your department at that time of Mr Tsoametsi how many DDG posts did it have?    Yes.    You see my understanding about advisors to Ministers and I assume that would apply to MEC’s evidence that I have heard suggest that you know an advisor to a Minister which I assume would be the same with an advisor to a MEC you know does not get involved with the operations of the department.  Those are left to the Head of Department or to the Director General.    And he or she is there to just advise the Minister or MEC.    Now that – that has given me the impression that when you are an advisor to the Minister you occupy a particular space that you are not – you cannot be Deputy DG of the department because that is now operations.  Is the position that simply he was paid at the…    Level of DD?    Which did not necessarily mean that he was occupying the position of DDG in your department.    Yes.    Yes but was there a DDG post that he was occupying as far as you know?    Yes.    It seems quite complicated.  Maybe we do not need to understand it for purposes – present purposes Mr Pretorius.    It is just that of course when…   When there is a blurring of roles sometimes that is where problems start.    Ja.    Okay alright.    Say it in Sotho first and then you can translate it.    Hm.    Did he not say anything about shoes?    Ja.    Ja.  Just repeat that what is – but it means literally in what he means in substance.    Okay alright.    Yes okay.    But he did not say he would fire you?    He said you…    He said if you did not want to implement the plan or the strategy you would have to submit your resignation letter?    Okay.      I am sorry. I am sorry.  I think I missed something somewhere.  Mr Tsoametsi brought this document to you.    Do you remember when it was when he brought the document to you?    It was the 25t h November?    And what was the purpose of him giving you this document?  I see it was addressed to you.    And approve the…    The – what was to be done.    And the document sought to spell out how the plan or strategy would be implemented.    Alright.  Did you have a discussion with Mr Tsoametsi at that time when he brought this document?    And did you say that you still felt uncomfortable?    And did he say anything to make you believe that there was nothing illegal about the plan?    Ja but did he say anything?  Did he try to persuade you?    Ja.  Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    And how did the meeting – your meeting with Mr Tsoametsi come to an end?  How did it conclude?    He left your office without the two of you agreeing.    And – and what was your way forward after he had left?    Oh immediately?    And you made it clear to Mr Tsoametsi you are not going to sign the document?    Okay alright.    So – oh okay I think that is what I missed.  So – so the MEC called you to his office.  You went there.  He asked you why you were not prepared to sign the document.    Yes.    Yes.    [Coughing] excuse me.  Was – was that meeting just between the two of you or was Mr Tsoametsi also present?    It was only the two of you?    Oh okay.  Did you not take the document at all or you did keep a copy and Mr Tsoametsi left with another  copy?  When Mr Tsoametsi left your office earlier did you keep a copy of the document or did you not keep any copy?    He came with – he came with one?    And left with it.    Okay.  So – so you had this meeting with Mr Zwane.  So he said he reminded you that he had told you that if you were not prepared to implement his plan then you must – you should submit your resignation letter?    And you had not obviously submitted any resignation letter up to that point?  So what did he say in the light of that?    Yes.    And how did your meeting end?  On what basis did you conclude that meeting?    Did you sign it in front of him?    Yes.    Mr Pretorius.    Why did you not say MEC I am sorry this is illegal I am not prepared to do – to sign it and I am not going to give you a resignation letter because there is nothing to resign for?    But you knew did you not that you could not be dismissed for refusing to do something illegal, is it not?    You knew that?    So if you refused to submit a letter or resignation he would have to dismiss you and you would have known that he could not dismiss you for refusing to do something illegal.    Yes.  So why did you not adopt that position namely I am sorry MEC this is illegal I am not going to be party to it and I am not giving you a resignation letter?    Yes.    Mr Pretorius.    At three weeks.    This is now in November?    Ja okay.    Well – was he correct to say he had power to allocate?    He had – he had power to allocate which contractors get what job?    Yes he had that power as an MEC?    Oh I thought that that would be the job of a DG and his or her officials and not a politician.    I am sorry are you saying that prior to him being an MEC for the Department of Human Settlements there was a practice in terms of which in the department you would show the list of contractors to the MEC whoever the MEC happened to be.    And the MEC would then allocate – indicate which – which contractors should be given jobs.    You would make recommendations?    Yes.  So – but what you were doing as officials was making recommendations to the MEC?    And the MEC would have the final say?    As to who should be given which tender or which job?    And who was the MEC before – for Human Settlements before Mr Zwane?    Yes.    And so with Mr Zwane you did the same?    Oh you did not make recommendations he came with his own list?    And he said that is my list?    Okay.  Mr Pretorius.     H’m.  Continue.     Was this list written on a paper, I take it?     Yes.  And it was 106 contractors all together?     Was your understanding that he meant that these were the only contractors who are supposed to be given the job?     And in the document that he gave you, was it already indicated how many houses, some of them must be given to build?     Were the units allocated to all the 106?     So it was a complete plan as to who must build how many houses?     Yes.     Okay, okay.     Mr Pretorius, if we do have that document here, it will be good to see it but if we do not, then it would be good to find out whether it still exists somewhere, the document that Mr Mokoena was given by Mr Zwane.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Do you by any chance have it somewhere yourself or other than what may be in the department?     Oh, okay.  Was it handwritten, was it typed, the names ...[intervenes]      The names were typed?     Okay.     Okay.  Not signed?     Okay.  Well ...[intervenes]      Was it on the letterhead of the MEC’s office or not?     Plain paper?     Okay alright.     Did you... you said that some of the contractors whose names were on the list were contractors that you did not know.       Is that right?     Was it just some or was it most that he did not know or are you not able to remember?     Many of them?     You might not recall how many but ...[intervenes]      And ...[intervenes]      You can tick.  Yes, yes.  Out of a 106, do you think that there were maybe more than 50% that you did not know?     Oh, around 40/45 that you had never heard of?     Yes.  You said that normally you used to, the principle that you followed in allocating construction work before was that those contractors who had a history of performing well when doing this kind of job for the department, you would give them more houses to build.     Was that principle followed in the allocation of houses that was reflected in the document that Mr Zwane gave you?     Are you able to say what principle was followed?  Was it the opposite of that principle or it was not necessarily the opposite but it was a mixture?     Yes.  Okay alright.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     So are you saying that when you looked at the list, you were able to recognise that some of the contractors on the list were you on your database of the department.     But you... are you saying that there were some who were not on your database and you did not know where he got them from?     Okay alright.  Thank you.     Make sure that you speak loud enough for the mic to capture what you say Mr Mokoena.     You said correct to the last question that Mr Pretorius asked you, is that right?     Okay.     Is that page 344?     So in other words, what makes you say ...[intervenes]      ...they were close to him or he was close to these contractors?     H’m?     Ja, in terms of their relationship.     But was he the one allocating them, houses to build under the Operation Hlasela Project?     He was the one allocating that?     Oh, okay.     Was that R 55 000,00 at the end of page 345, is R 55 000,00 per unit?     Yes, okay.     I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Just to try and follow and this is as Mr Pretorius just said, it was something that was covered in the review application but I just want to have clarity in my own mind.   You have a material supplier, you have a contractor, a building contractor and you have the department.  Now in terms of Mr Zwane’s solution of strategy, the material supplier would supply the material or deliver material to the contractor.     And then the contractor would then issue an invoice to the department.     And then on the basis of that, the department would then pay the contractor.     Or the material supplier.     Okay so the department will pay the material supplier.     But it would do so without checking whether the material had been delivered.     Match.  Ja.      Yes.  But of course, if the department wanted to check, they could check that, is it not?     If the capacity to check.     But did the department also asked the contractor to certify or confirm in writing that the material had been delivered?     Yes.     H’m.     Yes.     So your department would have something     Whether that was factually true or not, would be something that you did not know.     Okay alright.     How was that helpful in the context of the real problem that you were trying to deal with namely to do a wish list or a wish programme to say by end of March 2011, end of the financial year, we should have spent the whole R1,3 billion that has been allocated to us?  Now let us work backwards and see how we would like – what milestone we would like to achieve between now, October 2010 and March 2011.  How was that going to help you?     Yes but how was that exercise of preparing this document if it was prepared on that basis going to help you because what you should be looking at, I would imagine, is given our capacity, given the short time left before the end of the financial year, given the allocations we have, what can we realistically achieve?  Let us prepare a document that will reflect what we can realistically achieve.  If you were talking about such a document, I would understand but, as I understand what you are saying, that is not what you were seeking to do, you were seeking to say what would be nice to achieve with this R1,3 billion in three months?  It would be nice to achieve so many houses, to build so many houses in January.  It will be nice to build so many houses in February and it would be nice to build so many houses by end of March, but it does not help anyway.     So why were you doing it?     But did you not …[intervenes]     Okay, Mr Pretorius?     Well, that being the case, Mr Mokoena, you were misrepresenting to the National Department.  You were saying to them we are capable of achieving this and we are going to achieve it, it is realistic, so that if they bought that story they would not take the money away but you knew that that was not true, did you not?     So why did you misrepresent the facts to them?     I mean, it is concerning because you were the HOD, that is a very responsible position and you have certain responsibilities, you are dealing with taxpayers’ money under your leadership.  The department had not built a single house by October 2010, six months into the financial year and now you are coming up with a document that misrepresents the situation, you put – you send it to the National Department in order to prevent the National Department from taking money and giving it to other provinces who are prepared to work.  That was wrong, is it not?     It should not have happened.     Are you sorry about having done this?     Okay.     Mr Pretorius?     Before that, before you answer that question, Mr Mokoena, of course if you had stood your ground and said I am not going to be party to this, this is illegal and you let Mr Zwane do whatever he wanted to do, if he wanted to fire you, let him do that, if he wanted to do that or you reported this to National Department, maybe other authorities within the province, but National Department, it may be that the National Department would have taken the money and therefore the money would not have been paid to suppliers and would not have disappeared as it seems to have happened, over R500 million.  You appreciate that?     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.  Mr Pretorius?     I am sorry.  You were good earlier on to give a spelling of some of the names.  I do not think we gave yesterday, Maxatshwa’s spelling for the record, for the transcribers.  Maybe let us do that.     Have you gone back to his affidavit?     Okay.  This other file we can…     We will not need it for some time.  Okay, yes, thank you, page 347.     I see here you say that you ended up having – the department ended up having two acting HODs during your absence.     Is that right?     Because there is only one post.     Yes.     But were they both paid as acting HODs?     Only one person?     Ms Mokhele?     So is the position that although you did not withdraw Mr Maxatshwa’s appointment as acting HOD but you told him verbally?     That the actual acting HOD would be Ms Mokhele?     Okay, so it would therefore not be correct, would it be to say they were both acting HODs because you might not have withdrawn the acting appointment in writing but you effectively told Mr Maxatshwa that the acting – the real acting HOD would be Ms Mokhele.     Is that right?     Ja.  Okay, alright.     Okay.     At the February meeting with the National Minister – because I think you already asked on that, Mr Pretorius, is that right?     You said you agreed to stop the payments.  When you said that, did that include MEC Zwane also agreeing or you were talking about yourself?     He also agreed?     Okay.     Well you – it might be necessary to just clarify that because I think your affidavit says he did.     It might be helpful if you did a supplementary affidavit just to correct that.     Ja, I think they will assist you.     Sorry I missed out, I missed that, what is it that you say you didn’t put correctly?     Advance payments.     Mmm?     To make advance payments to some ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes.     Okay.     Okay, he didn’t try further?     Okay.     Yes, okay is the next witness after Mr Mokoena on Friday or is there one tomorrow?     Yes.     Okay so tomorrow another witness will be Mr Maxatshwa.     Okay and then Friday it will be another witness?     Okay no that is fine, let us adjourn then for today and then resume tomorrow at ten o’clock.     So we will adjourn Mr Mokoena, we will resume at ten o’clock tomorrow morning.     We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    In 30 seconds Chair I will be ready if I may?    Good morning Mr Mokhesi.    We were at Bundle FS14 at page 129 and we were about to deal with the conclusion of the so called cession agreements; material supply cession agreements.  But I wanted to deal with something before that; that is not dealt with to any extent at least in your affidavit. In paragraph 92.1     92.1 at page 127 of FS14.  You describe there the difference between the building contracts and the material supply agreements and you explained how the material supply agreements amended or altered the building contract agreements and the regime that was set up in terms of those agreements.  Do you recall that evidence?    Alright.  And then if one goes – in describing those agreements your affidavit does say that it is not clear how the parties who entered into the material supply agreements were identified.  In other words, who selected the suppliers?  Do you recall that evidence?    Was any investigation done under your watch at least to find out how the individual suppliers were appointed?    Yes.    Yes because the contractor had to produce the building ultimately or the buildings at a set price.    Yes.  And we know that subject to individual investigations and we know that there are some examples produced by those investigations that show that there were suppliers who did not act properly or honestly and suppliers who should not have been appointed in the first place. Is that correct?    Now one would have thought that in those circumstances one would have asked the question, who appointed the suppliers and why were these particular suppliers appointed?  I am not talking about the genuine suppliers like Corobrik and others.    So that problem arose both in respect of the contractors and in respect of the suppliers.    And you say that full information could not be obtained in regard to the manner in which they were selected.    I would like to put to you some passages in that regard from the disciplinary inquiry.  If you would just reach behind you please and get Bundle FS12.  That is the statement bundle.  This is the affidavit of Mr Mokoena.  Remind us please Mr Mokoena was who?    At the – during 2010/2011?    Correct.  If you would go to page 344 please of that bundle.      Yes.      In his affidavit which we will deal with hopefully later today Mr Mokoena is dealing with the implementation of the prepayment plan at page 344.  You have that at the top of page 344.    He says   In paragraph 20 Mr Mokoena says   Alright.  You say they were not forthcoming?    Apologies Chair.  We will deal with further allegations in this regard in the affidavits and in the disciplinary inquiry in due course.  But what is striking Mr Mokhesi that there was a disciplinary inquiry conducted against certain officials – the more junior officials.  The transcript of that inquiry runs into almost 3000 pages of finely packed detail.  There was a thorough investigation in regard to certain people but it seems in regard to others there was no investigation at all.  And the inference that is drawn is that certain people were being protected.    Well we will come to that in more details in due course.  Perhaps not in your evidence but in the evidence of other witnesses as well.  But does it not strike you as strange that we have a disciplinary record of nearly 3000 pages of questions arising out of a very thorough and very detailed investigation on the one hand and then in respect of certain persons questions simply just are not asked.  Is that not a strange situation?    Well we know that no questions were asked about how the 106 contractors were appointed by you certainly.  You see the point I am making is that certain people were picked for discipline that is another question how those names were arrived at but I am not going there for the moment.  Certain people were charged pursuant and an inquiry was held pursuant to a hugely detailed set of investigations.  Investigations that took 3000 pages to lay out and traverse in the disciplinary inquiry and there were disciplinary inquiries findings.  And I will deal with those findings in due course because one of the defences raised by those persons was we were following orders and implementing decisions by others.  Notwithstanding that defence they were still found guilty and they lost their jobs and some still are unemployed.  That is on the one hand.  On the other hand, in relation to who made the decision and how the decision was made to select the contractors once the procurement processes had been abandoned it appears that no investigation has been done at least that you know of.      Thank you Mr Mokhesi for that.  You will understand that part of the submissions that the legal team will make at the conclusion of this evidence will deal with the issue of accountability.  In other words, who was called to account for what happened not under your watch but before you came to the Department.  And so it is only fair that these questions be put to you even though you were not there at the time you were there at the time that accountability or non-accountability occurred.  I am sorry.    Yes.    Do you know for example from your own investigations Mr Mokhesi who devised the prepayment plan?  Whose idea was it in the first place?    Sorry by?    Tsoametsi yes.    From Mr Tsoametsi.    Yes but he wrote that memo on instructions.  You know that?    Alright.  Because that is question do you know where the plan originated?  Who was responsible for the devising of the plan?  Do you know that?    No, no I am…    Yes, no all I am asking you – I am sorry I interrupted you.    Did you finish?    All I am asking Mr Mokhesi is do you know from your own investigations who devised the plan.  That is all I am asking.     Alright.  Well, let us go back to page 344 of FS12 at paragraph 20.       That is Mr Mokoena’s file.     Affidavit.  And towards the end of 10, is the period we are dealing with here, he talks of the     Yes, and he will be asked these questions.     You can rest assured Mr Mokhesi.     But the question I am asking is also not a difficult one.  Did you under your watch conduct any investigations into allegations of this nature?     Yes.     Now the point I am putting to you is there is evidence that we know of and that the investigators have unearthed in relation to the question as to who devised the plan and who selected the contractors that became part of the plan. Now all I am asking you, were those investigations or a similar investigation ever conducted by yourself or by other people under your construction when you were Head HOD?  That is all I am asking.       About two questions.  Who selected the contractors that were to get contracts from the panel of contractors or the database of contractors?  And how was the plan devised and by whom was the prepayment plan devised?  Those two questions.     Did you ever ask ...[intervenes]      Well, that might assist us Mr Mokhesi.  Is there a document which contains those terms of reference for the investigation under your watch?     Thank you.  That will help us.     In any event, if we go back to page 344 of FS12 at the bottom of the page, the last paragraph if I can just place it on record again and then go over the page. “In relation to the six contractors mentioned above ...[intervenes]      Well, I am sorry to do this.  It is important that it be placed in context because I want to put a long passage to you.  Mr Mokoena says in paragraph 20 on     Yes.  Paragraph 21 on page 345     Yes.     He then goes on to say that ...[intervenes]       “Within Human Settlements, he used to work on a system whereby we graded our contractors in terms of competencies/performance.  Therefore, we made sure that those contractors who always delivered on their contracts were the ones that received the big allocations for the construction of houses.   This did not happen in relation to the appointment of these unknown contractors.   To provide some context, it just does not make sense to award a contract to a contractor to construct 600 RDP houses if that contractor has never constructed an RDP house in his life.   The latter is however exactly what we ended up doing based on the instruction of the MEC.  We, for instance, allocated between 500 and 600 units/houses to the first six contractors that appeared on the MEC’s list.   At that stage, the units/RDP houses were constructed for an amount of about R 55 000,00...[intervenes]      Well, I heard that...     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.  Perhaps I was not clear ...[intervenes]      ....what I mean.  He is saying now ...[intervenes]      ...in the course of the investigations that that happened in the past.     So his... that is his current ...[intervenes]      ...view of what happened in the past.  Thank you, Chair.     Mr Mokhesi, the simple point I want to make is, this is precisely the sort of issue that one would have expected to be the subject of thorough investigation after the event.  Would you agree with that?     Thank you, Chair.  The point that is at issue at the moment Mr Mokhesi is a broader point than simply your own knowledge and your investigation.   Although your own knowledge and your own investigation is part of the point that I am attempting to deal with you.   At paragraph 93 of your own affidavit at page 127 of FS14 ...[intervenes]      FS14, paragraph 127.  That is your...     It is on the left-hand side.  This is your affidavit.     93 on page 127.     You said second colon    I understand the point you make Mr Mokhesi about lapse of time but our investigators have managed to obtain at least some information in 2019 and .  Not as if the information has just disappeared.  The people are there.  They can be asked questions.       Well ...[intervenes]      And although some of the questions Mr Mokhesi might seem probing and might seem to call you personally to account in your official capacity, really what the Commission is looking for is your assistance to help the Commission answer certain questions that it has.   And the question that we are probing at the moment is the question to accountability.  We know what happened to a degree, not in all the detail that we would wish but to a degree we know what happened.  And we are now exploring if he was called to account for it.  We know that a number of employees who participated in the execution of the scheme were dismissed despite the fact that they said they were following orders, right?  And I will deal with that in due course. There are two questions that do not seem to have been answered let alone resulted in any accountability of note to date.  If we are wrong about that then that is where we would like your assistance. The first question is we know that there was no procurement process either in respect of the contractors who built houses and in respect of the parties who supplied materials but we know they were selected nevertheless and the question is, who selected them and on what basis and we would like your assistance in that regard.  If there was no investigation done into that question, we would also like to know that and perhaps even ask why not. The second question is, this recovery plan or this prepayment plan, and in some context, they are treated as different plans, who devised that plan?  Who is ultimately responsible and should be accountable for devising the plan and deciding on the plan in the first place, the very plan which employees then participated in to implement and got dismissed for?  What has happened to that?  Was that question investigated? So those are the sorts of things we are looking at now and if I could take you to the findings of the disciplinary enquiry because you refer to the disciplinary enquiry at bundle FS19, page 655.     Page 655 of FS19.  This is an extract …[intervenes]     Yes are you in FS19?     Yes, this document is the reasons or the findings of the disciplinary enquiry into several employees who were charged and dismissed as a result.  You know of those circumstances, is that correct?     Do you know who decided who should be charged?     Well, do you recall your answer earlier when I asked you, Mr Mokhesi, about who devised the plan, right?  We know that employees were disciplined and dismissed for participating in the execution of the plan.  You know that, correct?     And in fact – I will give you the detail in a moment from the finding, it is in the reference that we have just called up there, but I want to deal with one issue.  When I asked you who devised the plan you said as far as you knew it was Mr Tsoametsi who devised the plan and he did so in a memorandum and we have got the memorandum and we can show that to you in due course but what is interesting is that persons were dismissed for participating in the execution of the plan but to your knowledge, Mr Tsoametsi devised the plan and he was not even charged.  Can you explain that?     But surely it should have been a matter of course that if he moves to another department he is charged nevertheless.  You cannot just escape liability for misconduct just by moving from one department to another, surely?     No, I am just asking why?  Why not?     Well, would you accept at least the following proposition?  Those persons responsible for devising and ordering the implementation of a fraudulent plan with all the characteristics that we have canvassed in evidence should have been held to account.     Would this be a convenient time?     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mokhesi, just for the record our information is that Mr Tsoametsi and Ms Dlamini the CFO of Human Settlements moved to Agriculture and had moved by the time the disciplinary enquiry took place, is that correct?     And of course, we know that the MEC, Mr Zwane, also moved from Human Settlements to Agriculture at the same time.     Right.  And the activities that took place in the Department of Agriculture have also been the subject of this Commission’s investigations and evidence but we do not expect you to comment on that.  Mr Tsoametsi evidence, however, before the disciplinary enquiry is of some interest.  If you would look please at FS13, bundle FS13 at page 531.     Yes, I am corrected, I am referring you to the transcript of Mr Tsoametsi’s interview with the investigators.     Page 531.     Now his evidence was that he participated in the selection of contractors and also that he had through a trust an interest in one of the contractors which interest he did not see as a conflict of interest but that is not for you to account for at the moment.  If one looks at page 531 at line 12, Mr Tsoametsi says …[intervenes]     Yes, you will see Mr Tsoametsi, it is actually line 11.     Are you on the black numbers?     Yes.  Now I want to draw your attention to the next line which is line 11.  It is not marked     And then Mr Lambrechts, the     Alright.  Let us look at the findings.  Well, let me just put it to – do you know of the principle in labour law of selective dismissal, that it is unfair to select certain people who are guilty of the same conduct for dismissal and not to discipline others?  That is unfair.  Do you know …[intervenes]     Well, perhaps I should not have put a label to it because that is a specialist endeavour.     But it just seems in the first place unfair to charge those who were down the line in the pecking order, as it were, in executing the plan and not charging the person who devised the plan, on your version.  That seems unfair.     You do not want to comment on the fairness of that.  Even Mr Tsoametsi commented on that.     But there is another point I think that is more – perhaps more relevant for present purposes and that is instead of being held accountable, Mr Tsoametsi moves department and appears somehow to be protected against discipline.  What do you say to that?     You do not know?     Well, let us look at the findings of that disciplinary enquiry where Mr Tsoametsi actually testified and so this evidence was available obviously when this testimony was given.  At page 655 of FS19, I am going to ask you to change bundles please to bundle FS19.       Page 655.     You recall evidence relating to the war room?     Yes.     You recall that?     The war room was in fact not so much a room as a series of meetings that took place to devise and implement the prepayment plan.  Do you recall that?     Yes.  Please, if you would speak up, Mr Tsoametsi.     Sorry, not Mr Tsoametsi.  My apologies, Mr Mokhesi.  Mr Tsoametsi and Ms Dlamini both testified at the disciplinary enquiry.  Now we know that Ms Dlamini was the Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Human Settlements in 2010, 2011.  She moved to Agriculture with Mr Tsoametsi under the leadership of the MEC, Mr Zwane.  Both of them testified in relation to the activities in the war room.  Now the employees were dismissed for amongst other things their participation in the deliberations at the war room.  You know that.     Paragraph 86 Mr Tsoametsi says – or not Mr Tsoametsi  at this stage, this is the evidence summarised by Adv van Graan, the Chair of the disciplinary enquiry and he is referring to the evidence of Mr Tsoametsi     And of course Mr Mokoena, yes.  We will speak to him later today, hopefully but neither – it seems as far as our investigations have gone, neither Mr Zwane – of course could not be disciplined by you, he was an MEC, but nevertheless - Mr Tsoametsi or Mr Mokoena were held to account in any way.  Is that not strange?     You have not answered.     Is strange too strong a conclusion to draw?     Thank you.       In relation to the role played by the MEC, Mr Zwane, Mr Mokhesi, there will be evidence – not your evidence – that in fact he directed the creation and implementation of the plan, he participated directly.  Are you able to confirm that?     Let us get back please to complete that series of agreements.  You will recall there was the first agreement with the contractors.  You have described that to the Chair.  The second was the material supply agreement, the so-called tripartite agreement.  You have described that.  And then you went to some lengths in the affidavit in the review application to describe the material supply cession agreements.      Well, I am going to deal in summary with that in order to avoid …[intervenes]     Yes please.     We will come – the disciplinary record, FS19, we do not need that anymore for the present at least.     Yes.     Yes, no, the passage that I was referring to was the passage testified to by Mr Tsoametsi that the MEC made allocation and there will be further evidence but that is to follow, Chair.     Yes.  We are at page 98 of the bundle.  That is bundle FS14, paragraph 98, I am sorry.     Yes.     Not page, I apologise, paragraph 98 on page 129 of FS14.     Well, we are going to go pretty fast now, Chair.     Page 129.  There you – same paragraph 98, the next piece of the puzzle is the conclusion of approximately 167 purported deeds of cession term Material Supply Cession Agreements by the contractors and material suppliers and agreed to by the defendant.  Now it is possible just for the record to summarise that by referring to the judgment of the court in that application at FS14, page 603 and all I am going to do is to ask you if you agree with that finding.  It does appear to be consistent with your affidavit but it will save us a lot of time.     603, paragraph 13 of the judgment of Pohl AJ.      You have it?     603, paragraph 13.     The judge says    For the materials so supplied and what was happening here is that claim was being handed, ceded to the supplier.  Whether this was necessary or no we will come to in a moment.     The second point made was that    Because the claim had been now passed to the supplier. “These cession agreements were then used as part of the documentation to create the farce of legitimacy so as to make the payments look regular and in accordance with the law.  As indicated before, it was all done to circumvent the provisions of DORA.” That is the Division of Revenue Act.  Now I can confidently say to you that these findings mirrored precisely the allegations in your founding affidavit.  Do you accept that?     Yes.  Of course the reason for that is that it was entirely unnecessary to have a cession agreement other than to give it to the people who were paying the accounts in the Department of Human Settlements to give it a veneer of legitimacy because when the materials – when the arrangement was made with the suppliers there was no claim.     To cede because the house had not been built yet.     And that claim would only arise when the house had been built [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     The milestones, yes, when the milestones had been achieved.     And verified.  Only then would such a claim arise.     So it was entirely unnecessary to have these cession agreements other than to convince people to pay.  Correct?     If I could then go to – back to your affidavit please.  At paragraph 107.     Page 132, my apologies again, of FS14.  Paragraph 107.2, you referring to the documents attached to your affidavit and you say in paragraph 107.2     Yes, but it appears what happened and this is in the findings of the disciplinary enquiry at least in some cases is that money was being given to the suppliers and the suppliers were then passing that money on to the contractors.  Did you know of that?      So this is a way of spending a lot of money quickly is simply to give it to the supplier and the supplier then hands some of that in cash to the contractors completely illegitimate I would assume.      But that happened – just for reference Chair those findings are in the disciplinary enquiry findings at FS19 page 664 and FS19 page 676 perhaps for completeness we should go there.     Let us deal with the first reference in the findings of the disciplinary enquiry proceedings at FS19 page 664.  Now we know that NURCHA was one of the entities briefed to do investigations.  You said that to the Chair sorry page 662 of FS19.         662, this is a summary of the evidence of Mr Lees of NURCHA which was an entity that was engaged to try and remedy the problems that had arisen in 2010/2011 you have told the Chair about that.  Correct?      One of the things that Mr Lees said appears in paragraph 8 on page 664. Mr Lees established that some of the material…[intervene]     Do you have it?     664 paragraph 108.      The disciplinary findings.  Mr Lees established that some of the material suppliers were advancing the contractor out of the cession payments they had received for the material from DHS.  So that appears to be conformation of what you have told the Chair that suppliers would get money from the department and hand some of those moneys onto the contractors, completely irregular is it not.  Correct?         So your own conclusion at     Okay I am sorry we taking it to fast, FS14 page 133.      Page 109    Yes.      Paragraph 109.  Do you have it?      So your conclusion there in the affidavit is the department then used the material supply cession agreements to make payments to material suppliers.  But what is interesting is the manner in which they were used and you describe that in paragraph 110 Mr     Correct?     And the reason is obvious because the cession had not created a claim in the first place it was just used as a document to persuade the Finance Department to pay.         Correct?     In paragraph 114 you give an example of, some of the corrupt activities that took place     So before the contractor, the construction entity, the builder has even claimed for building the walls and the roofs you have already paid for the material which by that stage would not have been delivered.  Correct?   MR     I am sorry.      Oh the milestone had not been there.      And you make the point of course that the reason for this is that roofing material is the most expensive of all the material and in that way a lot of money could have been spent and received.      That is where the high cost are.      You make that point in paragraph 115 on page 134.  In paragraph 118 and I am not going to go into the detail of this, it I safe to say that the HSS the housing subsidy system has its own rules and regulations...[intervene]       And that system was manipulated to put in there supply of material as a milestone when it should not have been.  Correct?     In paragraph 132.     132, paragraph 132, page 143.     You say    You did not receive value for money, you were satisfied with that statement at the time and now.  Correct?     And then in paragraph 135 you make perhaps the most important point of this whole     Then paragraph 143 on page 147 if we could deal with that briefly please.   “As I stated earlier.”     The first question is was action taken against all the contractors and suppliers or only some?      Yes.      There may be other evidence or certainly a need for other investigation in that regard but we do know that many of them had gone into liquidation or been sequestrated.      Thank you Chair.  Mr Mokhesi at page 150 – perhaps before I ask you to deal with the matters that appear there.  There have been indications and I put it no higher than that for the present that have been drawn to our attention by the investigators that some of the suppliers and contractors who should have been sued were not sued.  Do you know anything about that?     Okay.      But that may well be the subject for further investigations but at that stage I can put it no higher than that there are indications of that.  If you would go please to page 150.        150.      You deal there with the regulatory framework and perhaps it is necessary to summarise that very briefly before we finish.  You referred to the framework of legislation and regulations that were breached in this construction and supply agreement project.             You start with the constitution we have dealt with that in evidence before you deal with that on that page.  On page 151 you deal with the Treasury regulations and the provisions of the Treasury regulations that are relevant and were offended they are there for the record it is not necessary to go through them in detail unless you wish to     Paragraph 162 and…[intervene]      Of course the provisions in the supply chain management policy were also offended.      No, page 152 paragraph 162.     Well I am…[intervene]     Page 152 paragraph 162, I could easily made another mistake.      And you make the point in paragraph 163 that there are very good reasons for the implementation of a fair transparent equitable and competitive supply chain management policy.  You say in     It means to – in 163.2    So if these procedures are not followed not only is it unfair on people who wish to bid for the work and do not get the opportunity to do so not only would it reduce corruption in the award of government business but importantly the process is there to ensure that people who are able to do the work get the work.  Correct?       And you would not have the problem of people walking off site or less problem of people walking off site not completing buildings which occurred in this case.  Correct?      Then the provisions of – well     What it does indicate however it is the importance of conducting a thorough investigation as to how the material suppliers were identified.  It is an important investigation.  Correct?       Then on page 154 Mr Mokhesi you deal with the division of Revenue Act and the requirements of that Act which we have canvassed.  In paragraph 168.2.1 and paragraph 168.2.2 you deal with Section 15.2C and B of the division of Revenue Act.  Correct?        And the reference that – perhaps I should have put to you yesterday appears at the top of page 155.  There I will read it to you the section of DORA     And then in paragraph 170 to 171 you talk about the conclusions of unauthorised expenditure as well as irregular expenditure in terms of the Public Finance Management Act.  We did not go into detail there but they are there for the record.  The conclusion you draw is in page 177.        177.     Paragraph I am sorry Chair page     But then in the second sentence of     And you stand by that?     Further detail is given and you deal there with the delay which we are not concerned with this in this application.  But if I may take you to paragraph 187 on page 162.  The head of department during 2010/2011 was Mr Mokoena.     He went to another provincial department.  Is that correct?     He did not go to a municipality?     Yes.  And you were appointed as the HOD.  You began in January 2012.     And then interestingly.  In paragraph 192 having referred to the investigations of the Special Investigate Unit, the SIU, you referred to a meeting that took place in April 2012.   “The then Premier and the MEC for Human Settlements called a meeting with senior department officials to discuss the fact that contractors appointed to construct the BMG funded houses were simply not performing.” Now this in 2012 in April.   “At that meeting it emerged that the contractors’ failure to perform under their contracts was largely caused by the fact that materials had not been delivered to them by the suppliers.” But we know that R 600 million had been spent, approximately.  The amounts vary but over half a billion rand had been spent on suppliers and yet, in April 2012 there were still complaints of none-delivery, correct?     And in paragraph 193, you referred to the fact that, in fact, the suppliers simply had not delivered material or at least a significant number of them had not delivered material.  That... was that the finding?     And then you talk in paragraph 194 of the department appointing Open Waters as forensic auditors to investigate certain of the allegations made by the contractors.  Now was that the contractors complaining that supplies had been paid for but not delivered?     Is that correct?     Just to summarise too.  We have the Nurcha remedial activity.  They were appointed by the department, correct? MR     Yes.  To do what?     Sure.     Correct.     Then you refer to the SIU report, the Special Investigative Unit support.     You have referred to the appointment of Open Waters as forensic auditors, correct?     And you have referred to the disciplinary proceedings.  All those reports and records Chair are part of the bundles and are summarised in the investigative report which is before you.  Mr Mokhesi, you have assisted us with a great deal of information.  Is there anything else that you feel you need to add?     As you please.    Yes, thank you Chair, the next witness is Mr Mpho Moses Mokoena, and may he take the oath?    Chair there is a bundle that has been handed to you, FS12, Bundle FS12, that is the bundle of the statements of the various witnesses, some of whom will testify, may that be admitted as Bundle FS12 and the affidavit of Mr Mokoena appears at page 334.     Page 336, Exhibit UU3.     Would you look at Bundle FS12 please Mr Mokoena at page 336, yes and we refer to the black numbers in the top left hand corner.    Are you at FS12 336?    Are you settled?  Alright, if you could go to page 353 please.  Also the black  numbers, top left hand corner.     Are you at page 353.    So when we refer to page numbers we will be referring to the last three numbers in the top left hand corner Mr Mokoena, if you would just look at the signature on page 353, whose signature is that?    And the document at page 336 to 353 is your affidavit?    And are the contents of this affidavit as far as you concerned at least true and correct.     Mr Mokoena are you currently employed?     Sorry yes Chair please.     Yes Chair, thank you.     Mr Mokoena you may be referred to somewhere in the papers as Gift Mokoena but another name?    Are you currently employed?    Between July 2009 and December 11 what position did you occupy?    To whom did you report in that capacity?    And what position did he occupy?    If you could go to paragraph 5 please on page 337, when did you join the Free State Provincial Government?     And you’ve told the Chair that you were appointed as Head of Department of Housing of Human Settlements in July 2009.     And how did it occur that your appointment came to an end in December 2011?    Could you go into a bit more detail please, what pressure was this?    Right you were describing the pressure which you experienced which led to your resignation in December 2011?     Is that beyond the thing that constituted pressure that he kept on making those announcements or is there something else?    So in short, the pressure you experienced, which led to your resignation was that there was an expectation placed upon you by the Premier to build more houses than you had funds and capacity for and bigger houses than you had funds and capacity for?     And these demands were public demands as I understand it?      Ja, that’s just for the transcriber.  After your resignation as Head of Department what position did you then occupy?     So you moved from the Province to a municipality?     What was the position in October 10 in relation to the budget that had been allocated by National Department and Treasury for the Construction of Houses.     It is a question that arose earlier, can you assist the Chair and tell the Chair by October 2010 how many houses had been built for that particular period?     Were there any houses built by that time?     So no houses by October 2010.     Yes, there would have been expenditure on title deeds, surveys, basic services and the like?       You have just told the Chair Mr Mokoena that by October 2010 six or so months before year end only 10% of the budget allocated had been spent.  What was their reaction to that situation at the National Department of Human Settlements, I am referring to paragraph 8 on page 339 of your ...     What happened then during October 2010, as you’ve described in paragraph 9? MR     Why was there that delay in completing the tender process before July 2010?     In any event you were dealing with the October 2010, what happened, was there a meeting?      Before you go there where did this meeting take place?       In Bloemfontein?     Who was present at the meeting?     Dlamini?     Right Mr Tsoametsi just for the record is that spelt Tsoametsi?     We will talk of him later.     And what was the purpose of the meeting?     Alright, so what was the problem?     And who proposed this solution?     And as far as you were aware who thought of or devised the solution?     You say that Mr Zwane informed the meeting that he had a solution for the problem?     What was that solution?     Did he mention anything about invoices?    Have a look at paragraph 11 please of your statement.      Did you ever any occasion to question the validity of the invoices during the implementation of the plan?     Alright, well let us get to that then.       Yes perhaps we are getting ahead of ourselves, we should slow down a little     Yes, the invoice issue arose in the statement and in the course of the meeting but – Chair, please, and in fact you are quite correct Chair.    From the beginning what happened at that meeting?  Who started speaking; whose idea was it; what was the idea and then your intervention and the response to your intervention?    Just if I may Chair?  Before you go to the meeting with the MEC after this general meeting may I ask you please who gave the instruction to Mr Tsoametsi to go and research the legitimacy of the plan?    So as I understand your evidence it was not Mr Tsoametsi’s advice that started the whole idea?    Well let us just clarify that.  The evidence this morning and yesterday was that Mr Tsoametsi produced a memorandum and it was said that that was the origin of the idea.  Now the memorandum – the only memorandum we know of authorised by Mr Tsoametsi is the one you refer to in paragraph 15 of your affidavit.  On page 243, do you see that?    Right.  Now leave aside what discussions might have taken place before the meeting.  The memorandum was that the first and the origin of the plan or did as far as you were aware were there some preceding discussions about it before the memorandum?    And if one looks at page 355 of FS12 what document is that?    Right. The date on the 25 November 10.    Now we have looked at this document and it perhaps not necessary to go through the whole document but this does not appear to be an opinion on the legality of the plan at all.  In fact, it assumes the legality of the plan and says how the plan should be implemented.  Am I correct?    To your knowledge was there ever a document prepared advising on the legality of the plan?    Yes perhaps there have more serious irregularities we have to deal with.    Not that that started…    Exactly.    Yes Chair.    In any event if one looks briefly at the MM2 at page 355 of FS12 I do not intend to take you through it in any detail but it is clear from the background section on page 355 that it assumes that the decision to implement the plan – the intervention strategy it is called had already been taken.    And it then goes on to set out how that would be implemented by setting out the responsibilities of the various parties.  That is the contractor, supplier and department.    Right we will come back to that in a moment and its signature.  But that document was presented to you on the 25 November 2010, correct?    Let us go back to the meeting that took place in Bloemfontein during October 2010.  You say that the plan was put as the plan of the MEC.  It was tabled; you responded to it and questioned its legality.  Mr Tsoametsi was then mandated to go and prepare a document as you say to do some research regarding the legitimacy of the plan.  We have looked at that document that you say is the – that document.  You then referred the Chair to a private meeting you held with the MEC after this meeting.  Would you tell the Chair about that please?    When he spoke to you in this manner that you have just described to the Chair did he use a Sotho expression?    Well would you tell the Chair what that expression was?    It may seem pretty obvious but what conclusion did you draw from his discussion with you at that private meeting as to what would happen to you if you did not comply and refuse to implement the plan?    Right.      The document we know from your evidence was ultimately prepared and presented on the 25 November 2010, correct?    Was it shown to you?    Right.  Did you read the document?    Right.  Did the document manage to convince you of the legality of the plan?    Why did you sign it?    This was now the 25 November 10?    There was a builder’s holiday to come on the 15 December 2010 for a month?    So effectively …    Ja there were four months left in the year – three weeks of which would be a builder’s holiday.  So just over three months left in the year.    And as I understand your evidence correct me if I am wrong because I may have misunderstood you that by this time still before the plan had been devised and the document signed no houses had been built?    In paragraph 20 you say shortly after your meeting with the MEC.  That is the meeting where – well     Either the meeting in Bloemfontein or the meeting where you signed the document, they may both have been in Bloemfontein but in any event did Mr Zwane approach you with a list of contractors?    Now the list that he gave you were those builders in other words contractors meaning builders or were there suppliers on that list?    Did you notice anything about the list?    Yes.  The evidence you have just given is let me put it - and it seems to me you are referring to a practise rather than a law or a regulation.       Because the first point that must be made is that no minister of MEC would have the power to appoint contractors.  That must be done through a proper competitive process.     The procurement law and regulations and policy must be followed.     So we are dealing here with an appointment process that takes place in absence of the procurement process.     My understanding and please correct me if I am wrong, but apart from a formal approval that might be required, an MEC as MEC, member of the Provincial Cabinet would have no power to appoint contractors at any stage of the process.  It is a matter of law.     In any event, he says here is a list of a 106 contractors, right?     Did he give you an instruction at the same time he presented the list to you?     Yes.  You have told the Chair that you have looked at the contractors that were listed and you raised some questions in your own mind and you communicated your concerns to the MEC.     And you said something about unknown contractors been given a high number of houses to build.  Will you just detail that for the Chair, please?     At the bottom of page 344, you refer to six contractors.     Yes.  I am told that we do not have that document but we will certainly make enquiries.  It could be mentioned in one of the reports and we will research that.     Otherwise, we will try and find it.     What happened to that document Mr Mokoena?     No, I am sorry.     Maybe I did not make myself clear.       The document itself, the piece of paper, what happened to the piece of paper?  Because the DCJ is interested in seeing that document.     Yes.     Yes. So ...[intervenes]      You have told the Chair Mr Mokoena that you raised your concerns about the contractors on the list, including concerns about the number of houses allocated to particular contractors.     What was the response of the MEC to you raising these concerns?     Was he amenable as far as you to revising the names of the names of the contractors on the list?     Did he say as much?     Before we move on, just two points, please.  At this stage, how long had you been working in the Department of Housing of the Department of Human Settlements in the Free State?     About 15-years?     Yes.  And during that time, did you come to know of the contractors who were good performers and those who were not?     So you were able to make an informed judgment of that list, correct?     The second point is, there has been evidence in the last few days Mr Mokoena of the context with in which these events would have taken place and that is the earlier tender process which had been abandoned.   You mentioned it now in your evidence.  And a number of categories of bidders formed part of the database, including those who failed the bid process.     And including those who were judged incompetent to be given work, correct.     Those ...[intervenes]      And amongst the 106 contractors, were there those that had been disqualified during the bidding process or can you not remember?     I think that fact emerges from the reports and we have summarised some of that of your benefit Chair.  In any event, at the bottom of page 344, Mr Mokoena you refer to the names of some of the contractors.  Could you tell the Chair about that, please?     344 of Bundle FS12, the last paragraph on that page.     Now you say these developers were very close to Mr Zwane in your own words but you do not really give the basis of that conclusion.  On what basis could you conclude that?     Well, it may be that from what you said, one could conclude that these contractors were favoured by being given contracts at all three levels but being very close to Mr Zwane implies something more than that or must be limited to what you have said is the reason?     So apart from the fact that these contractors appeared to be favoured by Mr Zwane in his allocation of the housing contracts, you have no other evidence of closeness.     Correct?     Well, that is your assumption.     You have no evidence of that.     Good.  Because it is a serious allegation.     But you also mentioned here that Mr Zwane communicated to you the need to expedite process payment.  What was that all about?     Right?     Yes.  But quite apart from the allocation of contracts to particular contractors, is it the job of the MEC and your experience to be involved in expediting payments to these contractors?     What was your conclusion about whether this was regular or irregular?     Paragraph 21, you talk about tenders and instructions of the MEC.  What was that?  I think you have already given this evidence.  Is there anything to add, paragraph 21.     Yes.  And you have given the evidence in paragraph 22 about how in your department you would work on a grading system.     And award contracts consistent with that grading system.     That was not followed in this allocation.     Well, what do you say there at the bottom of page 345?  You provide some more detail.     I think you have given this evidence but perhaps just for completeness so that we do not leave anything out.  What do you say there in the last part of paragraph 22?     So if you allocate ...[intervenes]      You get about 275 million.     Really?     It is a lot of money.     R 55 000,00 times 500.  I am sure someone can work it out for me.  But it is a lot of money.     Right.  This programme then, you say in paragraph 23, again with the signing of contracts with the contractors.  When did that take place?     Right.  And once these contracts had been signed, how did the plan continue to be implemented?     Alright.  We have learnt in the review application of the papers of the detail of the three chairs of contract.     The first being the contract with the contractor, the second being the try-part(?) contract for the supplier and delivery of materials.     And the third being the cession agreement.  But I do not want to go back through those detailed agreements.     So if I understand what you are saying that pursuant to this contractual arrangement of cessions and supply agreements and contracts with contractors, materials were delivered.     To the contractors.  And the claim was made against the department against which claim the department paid.     Now was... were you satisfied when you received the claim in the form of an invoice or how ever that in fact the materials had been delivered?     Yes.  And that is a subject matter of later investigations.       Just ...[intervenes]      Well, we have heard evidence and again one does not want to go back into the complexity of the relationship between these three chairs of agreement.  But we have heard evidence that, firstly that the agreements of cession were used as documentation to justify the payments.     And we have also heard evidence that the document required to verify a payment such as the certification of receipt by the contractor.  Those were not always present when payment was made.     Is that correct?     Right.       Yes.  But of course, the original agreement and the standard form arrangement of the relationship between the contractor and the department had its own safeguard because the contractor would have to source the materials.     The contract would have to pay.     And if there was anything untoward in that relationship, the contractor would suffer ...[intervenes]      ...if the contractor had now to pay for materials that had pay for materials that were not even delivered, correct?     So the contractor would in its own interest check that supplies were actually delivered in correct quantities of the correct quality because it ultimately is responsible for payment.     And only after a milestone has been reached, can the contractor then claim for those materials from the department, correct?     So that system has its own inherent safeguards.     None of those safeguards existed or very few of those safeguards existed in this new plan.  Is that correct?     And that was your concern.     You say in the third paragraph, not the third numbered paragraph on page 346, that during the period November 2010 to February 2011, an amount was spent in pursuance of this plan of supplying materials and paying materials supplies.  How much was that?     But this plan of paying suppliers to supply materials to contractors cost in a short period of time R 500 million.     And do I understand correctly, this would then be... or what was the purpose of spending the money?  Let me not put words in your mouth.     I would like to show you, if I may, another document which you do not mention in your statement but before I show you that document.  The position now is, November/December 2010, no houses have been build and the department’s plan is to pay half a billion rand and more to suppliers in order to avoid losing the money.     Correct?     If you look behind you, please and file or Bundle FS14, and if you would please go to page 226?     Yes.  The document on the right hand side of that page, begins there, at least.     That one.  Do you recognise that document?     What is it?     How did that document come to exist?     Alright, we will get to the war room later.     That war room we have learnt was a series of meetings that devised and monitored the implementation of the expenditure – the advance payment plan, correct?     Alright.  So – and we have heard from other sources about this document.  If I could take you please to the document at FS14, 233.  It is headed Cash Flow Projection.  Now more or less what was the date of this document?  When would it have been compiled?     October 2010?       And if you look at the cash flow projections, we can go through it in detail, if you like, but in summary what those projections represent is the completion of several thousand houses or units at a total cost of R1 billion.  Do you see that?     Was there any hope on earth that this could ever have been achieved?  Or perhaps I should phrase my question more neutrally.   What prospect was there of this being achieved if it were made in months of the financial year?     I see.  So you were saying look, we have been allocated …[intervenes]     …over a billion rand, this is how we would like to spend it.     Is that…?     But was it realistic?     Right.       Well, you have used the words unfocused, impractical and unrealistic but at this time you were engaged with a different project and that is the material supply expenditure of over half a billion rand, correct?     You were not engaged in this project that you see on the paper.     But this was a document that was to be given to National, not so?      Was the purpose not to persuade National not to take your money away?     Yes, I am sure that in time the Chair will appreciate and will express his appreciation for your frankness.  Thank you.     Of course, one does not have to emphasise or even mention the prejudice that these actions and misappropriation of monies caused for the people who deserved to have decent housing.     What happened then in November and December?     Mr Mokoena, in November and December or rather, in December, did you take leave?     What was the instruction of the MEC about leave for your department’s employees during that time?     Right, you look leave?     And who did you appoint to act in your place during the time of your leave?     And what was the response of Mr Zwane to that?     And did that happen?     So you had two HODs during that time?     Yes, it is M-a-x-a-t-s-h-w-a, is that correct?     And Kaizer is K-a-i-z-e-r, is that correct?     And Ms Mokhele, M-o-k-h-e-l-e.     During that time then, the payments that were made, by whom were they approved?     Are you able to comment on what you describe here as deliverables, in other words the actual success of the project or is that something we must leave to the investigators?     Yes, I have, page 347.     Yes, please, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mokoena, under the heading Deliverables do I understand in summary what you are saying is that some houses were built up to foundation stage?     But no more, no complete houses in this period.     And, of course, NURCHA was then appointed to attempt to remedy the situation, is that correct?     On page 348 under the heading Meeting with the National Minister of Human Settlements you described a meeting that took place in February 2011.     Was this meeting elsewhere referred to as the Welkom meeting?     Alright.  But if you could help us please, do you recall a Welkom meeting?     Alright, then we will have to find out about that meeting from someone else.  So do not concern yourself with that.  Tell us about the meeting that happened during February 2011 please.  Who attended?     Right, what was the purpose of the meeting?     Yes, prepayment model.     What did he say?     Now you knew prior to February 11, Mr Mokoena, that the National Department of Human Settlements and Treasury was concerned about expenditure.     You have told the Chair already about the expenditure recovery plan what misrepresentation had been made to National in that regard but was it ever told to National or ever reported to National that this prepayment scheme had been devised and was in force?  Did you ever say to them in October that the scheme had been devised and they should know that this scheme with all its question marks was taking place?     But you continued nevertheless?     Did you ever tell them that despite their rejection of the plan you were still going to continue with it?     Yes.     Did he – before he agreed, did he engage the National Minister at all?     Did the MEC attempt to persuade the National Minister that the plan was legitimate?     Right.  And in attempting to persuade the National Minister of the legitimacy of the plan did the MEC refer to any document?     Alright, just have a look – if we have to correct this we have to correct it but if you look at the second last paragraph on page 348 you there refer to the Tsoametsi document.     Alright, so he did not mention that document.     Yes, well let us go there.  In your statement at page 348, paragraph 27, you deal with the meeting that we are discussing now.     The meeting that took place in the office of the National Minister Sexwale, correct?     You say that    That happened?     Yes.  So the Minister did not say you told me, he said he had found out.     Yes.  In the second sentence you     Alright, so you inferred that what he was referring to was that document?     Yes and we looked at that document, that document does not say anything about legality, it presumes the legality.     Alright.     You say in the last paragraph that in view of the meeting and what happened at the meeting you had to give an undertaking as the accounting officer in the Free State that we would stop the advance payments.  Did you give that undertaking?     And did you stop those payments?     Well, there is some evidence or some allegations at least that the payments continued after that.  Do you know anything about that?     Yes.     Well, there is evidence to the effect that the payments continued – or at least there are allegations to the effect that payments continued after February 2011 to suppliers pursuant to the scheme.  Do you know anything about that?     Well, have a look at the next page, page 349, paragraph 28.  Just have a look at that and tell the Chair what you say about those three lines there.     Alright.     So is it correct that Mr Zwane insisted that you continue paying contractors?     The scheme, the prepayment scheme? MR     And you said no?      Were there other payments that had to be made that were of a regular nature or milestones being reached and the like?     Well did you pay in terms of existing contracts before supplies were delivered?  Did you make any prepayments after February in terms of existing agreements to do so?     Alright, you only paid the regular contractors milestone achieved payments?     Chair I am almost finished but there are a number of issues that I must still put to Mr Mokoena arising out of the last two days evidence, and I would like an opportunity just to check my list, I could go on, but it might require me to come back tomorrow anyway and in any event we will finish tomorrow with the witnesses set down for tomorrow.     No tomorrow ...[indistinct – microphone off] yes I don’t intend, unless I am directed otherwise Chair calling Mr Koloi because all that he does is confirm what Mr Maxatshwa says.     So we will finish in time tomorrow with those witnesses.      Yes.     Yes.     Thank you Chair. 
MR MOKHESI:  Morning Advocate.    Yes.    Yes it was yes.    Yes.    No.  It – you know the – no, no it was not – it was not done to that extent but it was very clear that they were selected arbitrarily because some of – some of    That I know but others [00   Yes the contractor had to – the price was fixed indeed yes correct.    Correct.  Correct.    Ja.  Look it – it – you know we – let me say for my side I never got a clear answer as to who supplied, who selected in the first instance and what was the criteria that was used?  Hence the – the investigation and ultimately the disciplinary process that went on.  Because the people involved did not come out very clear as to how – how these – how the contractors were appointed; who selected; how they were selected and so on?  So that information never came up.    The suppliers.    Yes.    Mr Mokoena was a HOD – Head of a Department.    That is correct.  Yes.    344?    Yes I am on 344.    Yes.  Yes I have that.    Yes.    Well No I did not because as you can see this was a meeting between two people if it happened and that information if indeed it was so I would have got it from the officials at that time but they were not forthcoming in terms of [intervention]    They were not forthcoming in terms of how – how one – how the contractors were – we know that it was cancelled – the bid was cancelled but the criteria that was used in terms of appointing those contractors that were there they were not forthcoming.    Well he never told me.    No I did not.    I – I – my questions was – my question were to the people who were at that time involved who were the officials; the senior officials in the department were part of that.    No I did not say – I could not say I took a conscious decision – I did not ask.    Chairperson.    I did not take a conscious decision.    Chairperson the fact is I did not ask.    I did not ask Chairperson.    It did not come to my mind at that particular time to ask because I simply took the – their reports – in other words that was there that says this is what has happened.  We have appointed these contractors and so on.  So that is basically where he ended and then I started to say okay let me – maybe let us institute an investigation to find out exactly what happened.    I was – I was not the only person who was doing the investigations.    I was also – I was not the only person who was doing the investigation at that time.    At that time – at that time as well an investigation had already been proclaimed.  When I went into the department the investigation – the President has already proclaimed on that.  The investigation was on-going anyway.  Now.    You see Chairperson when I – when I arrived there was already an issue or a complaint – a letter directed to me.  On the first day when I reported for work the SIU had – there was already a letter on my table that says officials are not cooperating including the Head of the Department.  Earlier there had been a letter that was written to the HOD then to say please this information and it was followed up by myself.  So if there is a point where they say the SIU themselves who had already started that there was no cooperation.  They have written to the HOD already and they were not getting joy.  Surely that was sufficient reason for me enough to be able to say alright let me just try and source that information.  Whatever information that SIU has requested that – at that particular time.  And this is exactly what I did.  Because already before the SIU has indicated that they had written to the HOD and around requests of this type of information and so on.  It was not forthcoming    They say – they indicated that they had written to the HOD and the officials concerned.  So that letter is there.    Mr Pretorius I do not know about that.  I do not know whether there are certain people who have been – who were protected.  I simply – because you know the result of investigation and so on and – you know the disciplinary hearing was as – was the outcome of the investigation to say the specific person and then that is what they pointed out and that is why there were those people who were – who were charged because I cannot at where I am say that there were certain people who were protected because mostly I was never – you know deliberately so to – just to keep away from the investigation as it was done both by – by the SIU as well as the one that we – was instituted against officials.  Because some of the four officials were only got away with a warning.  Not everybody was dismissed in process.  There are officials who were also charged but they received a warning.  There were others who had – who were dismissed on the recommendations.  So to say that there were – there were others who were protected honestly I am not in a position.    Which persons?    Okay.    Chair with due respect this thing happened and when I come here I do not know the questions that I am going to – you prepare for some but others you do not.  But I think yesterday what you have instructed me to do – requested me was to – to get that information which I said we would – it should be in the – we should be in the position to get it by going back into the system.  That I said we will do.  Now I am under oath here.     You know I cannot – I cannot – the most dangerous thing is for me to speculate and find out that it is not actually correct.  I am under oath.    I did.    I did to say I will try and…    And get that information.  It is probably also available on the annual reports and so on and so on you know the number of annual reports that are – that are    Because I think what I would also indicate is that because of that – because of that particular issue it became very difficult to catch up in terms of the targets or the fiscal targets that had been set for five years.  Because there was no new money so this issue of non-achievement in that particular year obviously will affect that.  So I had said you know with those particular – because it is about numbers; how many and so on and so on and I said I will – I undertook that I will provide that information.    You know I said I have – you know earlier yesterday I said you account for those things that happened even before your time.    And so that I appreciate [00   Well when I look at the – at the memos or you know documents that were there – there was a memo from you know particularly one that was signed by three officials Mr Tsoametsi I think.    Mr Tsoametsi the one that we discussed.    Yes because it looks like it originated from that particular …    From Mr – from – ja it – from that memo which was signed and approved.    Well I do not know on whose instructions.    Well I think – I think the commission has called all the people to come and account here.    To say on whose instructions – what I know is that it originated from that memo and if Mr Tsoametsi says it was – he was instructed then he must say by who because… [speaking over one another].    Okay.    Yes.    You say Mr Pretorius it was devised – it was – Mr Tsoametsi got instructions.     I do not have knowledge of that.     Yes.     I do not have any knowledge of that.     Is it the same?     Okay.     Chairperson... oh, sorry.  Ja, Chairperson, you know if you... if somebody asks you to do something that is irregular or unlawful or whatever the case might be and... because this is the discussion, this is what an allegation between the accounting officer then to say this is how I was instructed and so on.  The first thing that you do is you write that down.  Now ...[intervenes]      You write.  You write.  You write to the authority.     To say ...[intervenes]      To say, who gave the instruction?  If you indeed would believe that this instruction is ...[intervenes]      Is unlawful.  The first thing that you do, you write to the authority.  To that authority that instructed you to say, this and that, because of the following reason and X Y.  You either do that under objection or whatever the case might be or you simply do not read.   Now I cannot answer for Mr Mokoena on the allegations and also around the investigation.  What am I going to achieve?  Because there is... you know, it is a discussion between two people who says, he said that and so on.   The fact of the matter is, you know, this is what he says.  What did he do?  And I am informed that he is going to come and testify here around that.  Then he will have to answer that.       Yes.     Yes.     I do not know what that... this actually happened.  Remember, you are placing this affidavit now in front of me.       I am saying, I do not know whether this happened.  This affidavit is being placed in front of me now.     I have never seen it before.     It has not been given to me.     About this?     The source of the prepaid plan comes from the name mos.  The name that was written by ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      Personally, no.  I asked... asked... if I asked... I asked that the whole thing must be investigated.  I was not specific to say investigate that and investigate that.       I asked that the entire ...[intervenes]      ...prepayments or material ...[intervenes]      ...be investigated.     Ja, I was not specific ...[intervenes]      The terms of reference were there.     And you know and to say, investigate this and come up with actually what happened.     Well, I will try and get that.     Ja.     Last paragraph, yes?     Yes.     Yes, paragraph 21?     Okay.  Yes, I see that.     Ja.  Remember Chair, I think in the disciplinary hearing Mr Mokoena was called and I do not know if he was called also to come and explain.   Now if... you know, you... I can only discipline people who are reporting to  me.  I cannot discipline people who I... you know, I cannot discipline my boss so to speak. Now if people are saying I was instructed to do X, Y, Z and there is no written communication that will also even suggest that indeed that did happen, it becomes very difficult. Because you are talking about the meeting of two people somewhere.  He says that and I said that and ...[intervenes]      But is there no duty on him as well to do the same?  What I am trying to say Chair is, in this particular instances because there are documents, signatories, memos and so on, then you are able to take a particular action or what is...  You know, there are investigations that are conducted.  There are memos, there are minutes and that.  Then on a     Okay, let me talk about me personally.     Oh.     You must also live with the consequences if you do not write.     No, I am saying if something is wrong and somebody instructing to do something wrong, the duty is     If he goes... if he continues and you know there is an insistence as it is alleged here, then you have a record ...[intervenes]      It becomes extremely difficult as well.  By the same way as... it becomes very extremely difficult as well.  You know Chairperson, also with those that report to me as well.  I have instances where they also will write to me because I encourage them because I also want to know why certain...  If somebody along the line disagrees with a particular     Where?  Page?     Oh, this one?     You said paragraph, Mr Pretorius?     127.  Oh, 93.  Yes.     Ja but let us look at when this affidavit was made.  This was made on 26t h and the people are no longer there.  So in the process of... because where we started, advocate.  We started with how... ja, we started with... is it action proceedings?  To try and get documents because that was the key.   Remember this, there were investigations.  SIU was doing something.  Was also busy investigating.  But key to us in terms of priority was that let us follow, let us follow where the money is.   We started with that action proceeding and indeed got a judgment before we went... because this was guys by a     No, but the people who were part or who were on this particular, are not there.  I mean, this.... I am not... I do not know whether you say they are there in terms of the department or elsewhere.     2011, yes.     No, I do not.     I do not.     No, I do not understand what it is.     Chair, I think what is not appreciated here in     The only thing that I perhaps had sight of is actually the report.  I saw the report now.  It is... it was attached.  But as I have indicated, the report is not my report.  It is the president’s report.     Ja but it seems as if I am being taking on, on things that perhaps did not come from my mind on that particular time, whereas you know, we are here and we are able to discuss this affidavit.  You see the affidavit that was done at that particular time.  We are here and able to discuss that.     [No audible reply]      Noted Chairperson.     Page?     I am not there.  655 you say?     Yes, FS19, 655.     Yes.     Normally what happens is that there will be first a preliminary investigation, which was done, you know, I will call it high level investigation, which was done by open notice so say actually can you look at this?  What happened here?     I am saying normally what will happen is that you will look at - you know, there will be an investigation, I will call it a preliminary to say we have particular – and what actually happened here in this.  Based on that particular recommendation and then you will say – obviously you write to those people and tell us why you should not be - you know, the normal part of the leading to suspension because then you have to look into their areas as well, them being the senior managers and in charge of that and then once these people have been removed or suspended then the investigation will continue in those particular areas and ultimately their role will then be determined.  Their role in terms of all these particular irregular expenditure as well will then be determined as to whether they should be charged or there is no – or simply warned, be a warning and so on.  And that process was done.     I am responding to what happened in this.  It was through a recommendation in terms of the preliminary investigations as to who are the people who will have been involved in this particular advance payments or material supply, etcetera.  So there would have been specific people who are in charge in those particular areas and those are the people that we will look at.     No, no, I do not say …[intervenes]     I made the decision.     Based on the preliminary investigation about possible people who were being involved.     Okay.     Mr Tsoametsi was not in the department any longer.  He was a witness, he was a witness of – in a disciplinary hearing.  So yes, he was not charged.     Well, he was not charged, Mr Pretorius.     Well, I do not have the reason except that it was per recommendations.   You know, people were subjected to that, to say who must be charged and so on and based on that recommendation from the investigations, the preliminary investigation and that is the action that we took or that is the action that they took.     Yes.     Yes, he was no longer in the department.     Yes, he was in Agriculture, yes.     Was in Agriculture.     Yes.     Chair, some of these things as to who do you charge and so on would ordinarily be on recommendation.  You know, I just want to say that particular individual.  Also taking into consideration that Mr Tsoametsi was a witness in this – in the disciplinary enquiry.     The recommendations and – ja, the recommendations from the investigations was that these people are going to be the witnesses and here are the participants and so on and this is how it went about.     Yes, which is what I did.     Chair, maybe on hindsight that should have been but he was in the department any longer but I accept that perhaps maybe on hindsight, I - you know, one should have taken it further than what was placed before me because you will hope at sometimes when – because this disciplinary process took a very long time, I think it took about two, three years to conclude it to say as and when things are going that some of the other things will come up, you know?  That is what we were hoping because this was a very complex matter, it was not a very easy matter to deal with and it still is a very complex matter, in my view.     I accept that.     Yes, correct.     Yes, correct.     131?     Okay.     531.  Yes, I am on 531.     You say line 12, 531, FS13?     I do not even have 11, it is 10 and 20.     Oh, okay.  It is 10 – actually for me, it is , 531 black numbers is actually 10.     Yes.     No, I do not have any comment.     Oh, okay.  I note that, Mr Pretorius.     Well, he was talking to other people – I note that, thank you very much.  I note, you know?     I would.     H’m.     Yes.     I do not know.     No, I do not know.     Page?     Oh, 655, yes.  I am on 655.     The war room?     Yes, the war room.     Yes.     I recall that.     Sorry, I am not Mr Tsoametsi.     Yes, I know that.     I see there is also a mention of Mr Mokoena as well.     [No audible reply]     To say is it …[intervenes]     No, I appreciate and understand the concern of Mr Pretorius to say -, you know, I appreciate and understand, so [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Well, yes.     Chairperson, you know, there is a reporting all the time for all of us HODs to MECs around, you know?  They have the specific role that they play in a department which is clearly defined by the law and account officer also have.  Now with all this particular things that had been said there, if indeed it did happen, I am not saying that it did, if indeed it did happen, one will conclude that there was an overstep by the MEC, if indeed this did happen.  So, you know, that is my response to that.  That if indeed this happened.     Well, I have my MEC, remember?     I would have my MEC who would also know about this particular – because this – you know, the disciplinary processes of the senior managers because by law the appointment of the SMS, as we refer to, you know, it rests with the executive authority in the MEC.  The MEC will certainly be knowing about what is going – I mean, my MEC basically.     No, it certainly is not my role to inform the - you know, to inform the Premier, my role is to have this information and also discuss it with the executive authority who is the MEC because I do not get into instances where I - you know, I discuss directly issues with the Premier when I have my executive to do so.     Because that is a potential for conflict.     Yes.     Whatever information there is.     Correct.     She will have the reports that are, you know, around what has happened.  Even at a point of suspending, particularly if you are talking about senior managers.  It has got to be in consultation – I do not know whether it is consultation after consultation but I think you understand what I am trying to say.     Basically.     She will know.  Probably not know if it is lower than the senior managers.     The director upwards, she will know.     There were reports.     Yes, the reports were there.     No, I am not able to confirm that.  I do not know.     129?     603?     Yes, I am on 603.     Ja, 603.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I accept that.  Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     Or the milestones.     Completed.     Yes.     Yes.     Page 107 or paragraph 107?     Yes and it is not, we are not in that business of giving finance.      Yes that was – yes I know, there are instances where it was an investigation it was discovered exactly what you are saying.  Now money was paid to - and cash was advanced to the contractor for whatever reason.      Yes.      Yes, there was no cause for a claim.      Yes.     There was no cause for payment.     662, ja I am on page 662.      Yes.     Page?      Ja, page?      108, yes.      Yes.      Sorry Mr Pretorius are we back on the same.         133, I am on page 133 yes.      So it is the opposite.     Yes, I have it.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Correct.      Yes.      The milestone which does not exist.      Ja.      Ja, in terms of the emphasis has always been on it yes, the finishing part.      That is where the high cost is.      Correct.  ADV PRETORIUS     Yes.      Yes, correct.      Yes, that was my information at the time to say we did not – at that time we did not receive value.       Yes, because I think even for now given what we have gone through and what has – you know the claims that we have against the supplier of material I can only conclude that we did not receive full value.  Amounts might have changed because there has been some recovery I am aware by the SIU.       Yes.      Yes.      To my personal knowledge it was taken against all the contractors and the suppliers.      To the best of my knowledge.      Yes there are instances like that, yes.  There are instances like that there were some that…[intervene]     I am afraid from what I have observed Chair we might not recover much in terms of my observation, particularly for those reasons that you have just indicated.     So - but we will have to go on up to the end you know this process that has been where we have got by the courts the latest application that we have done will continue against all of those but clearly there are others who are liquidated that we know and I am informed that there has been also action that has been taken on other.  I think our legal can be in a position perhaps just to give the latest report as to how far the process has gone.      Well let me – to be fair also to the contractors they did not receive you know when money went from the department out it went to material suppliers.      And this is…[intervene]     It might have got to the contractors as it has been demonstrated that there were some instances where they were given cash.     And in certain instances, the material was purportedly delivered but there was no proof in the form of delivery notes, invoices etcetera, etcetera that indeed that material was delivered.             In certain instances, you have a delivery note but then the contractor is saying ja but this is not my signature that is there.             In certain we have instances where we were informed that material was simply dumped on site where there were no people to receive it and so on.             Now and I think this is also what informed the second review of you know the review of the decision to say to those that receive money you must tell us what is it that you did.  If you cannot prove where the money went to, it must come back.     In the department?      No.      No that has not happened.     No, it has not been raised.      I have only said to the best of my knowledge all the contractors.       All the contractors or the material suppliers.      Yes, page 150?     Yes.      Yes.      16?     Sorry Mr Pretorius you said page 162?      Correct.      Yes, I see that, thank you.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Page 177?     Yes.      Correct.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     No, he went... sorry, sorry.  My apologies.  He went to the municipality.     Correct.     Yes, correct.     Yes, that was the finding.     Not delivered.     That is.     In the main to also to matter they are involved in project management and building and financing at the time.     Bridging financing.  That is their mandate.  So they were assisting us, one, to reconcile and see what happened and also to provide a project management support to the department which was obviously lacking.       Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No, I think none.  Thank you, I have... it has been two long days.     Chair, we had an understanding with SIU.  And one of the things that they said that they would handle because at some stage as well, I think they made me sign an affidavit.  I suppose it was around the documents.   I cannot recall what exactly because they did on my behalf.  But they will deal with the recovery part.  They will deal with the investigation.  Because you know, they are able to do certain things that we cannot do.   You know, like accessing bank accounts of the individual and so on and so on.  But they will into that.  They will make that investigation and then hand over that information to appropriate law enforcement agency,  whether it is assessing for SARS, et cetera.   So that was the understanding.  And I am informed that the case has been opened.  I assumed that that was in that light in that understanding that we had with them at the time.     Right at the beginning when we made this, when we started.     Yes, it would be around... although, by the way, they had already... by the time I assumed office ...[intervenes]      ...the proclamation and so on had already been made.      Already.  They had already started and hence also that me then to say... they were struggling to get information.  That is something that we have discussed.  It is not for now.     To say, this is how we will proceed.  And indeed, we proceed around the civil route because it was... given the amount of money that I will say we did not receive value for ...[intervenes]      ...it became important for the department and try and recover as much as possible.     And SIU will deal with these other issues.  So there has always been cooperation between ourselves.     Not to my ...[intervenes]      Not to my knowledge but I am aware that the law enforcement agency are working on it.  We have been interviewed by the law enforcement agencies.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Yes.  Okay we will take the lunch adjournment now and we will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES 
MOKHESI: But you must also live with the consequences.   Oh the milestone which does not exist…[intervene]   Yes, they were appointed by the department.

MR MOKOENA:   My full names are Mpho Moses Mokoena.     No I don’t.     Yes I do.     So help me God. MPHO MOSES MOKOENA   [D.S.S.]     [No audible response] ADV PRETORIUS     353 yes.     It is my signature.     It is my affidavit.     Correct.     It is my other name.        I am currently unemployed.     I was occupying a position of Head of the Department for Human Settlements in the province of the Free State.     I reported to Mr Mitzebenzi Zwane.     He was my LEC for Human Settlements.     I joined the Provincial Government of the Free State in 1995.     Yes, that is correct.     In December 2011 I resigned, due to the pressure that I was feeling as the Head of the Department, especially from our Premier, Mr Ace Magashule.      My qualifications were Master of Science in Development and Planning.     Yes, the pressure I meant I experienced at that stage was that we were under a state of ensuring that we turn the houses, the material that we had into houses, but at the same time when we go out on the outreach programme called Operation Hlasela the Premier would still be allocating and announcing radically and that would happen even if we sat down in the session where we brief him but we don’t have any additional budgets for those allocations but he will continue to go and allocate, announce allocations, new allocations everywhere we go and on top of that he was also pressurising us to build bigger houses but the amount of money that we had from National is for only the 40m², that was the biggest pressure on me.   I wanted ...[intervenes]      That’s correct.     Mainly those are the two key pressures that I was feeling, because my main pressure was to ensure that the material, the building materials that we had already purchased as a department should be converted into houses as per our agreement in February 2011 with the Minister, because certain Minister said, Mr Tokyo Sexwale said follow the money and turn those building materials into houses, so when we were busy trying to do that with the less capacity because we’re only about one year old, because it was a new department that started in 09 so in 2010 we were just one year old, so we were still trying to grapple with own capacity, to build our own capacity in terms of the technical side, as well as our capacity in terms of project management, so we were still v0ery weak at that stage, so when we are busy with that he continued to allocation on the other side sporadically, outside of our budget, so that for me was a very big pressure.     That is correct.     That is correct. ADV PRETORIUS     That’s correct Operation Hlasela.     Yes.     After my resignation I became HOD for Human Settlements in our newly established Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality.     That is correct.        We were under-spending on our budget, we were level about 10% of our expenditure to the R1billion that was granted to us as a province.     I won’t be having the figures right now, because I think at that time we were only at, we had just started putting up our war room so I do not have figures right now.     Not yet.     October 2010 there were no houses here.     I think my recollection is correct but we had not built at that stage and we had a problem because we didn’t have service providers appointed yet.     As contractors yes.     Who would have built the houses.     That is correct.     Something like that, correct.     The information was available, I don’t think it could have been difficult to get that information.     Should not have been difficult.    Correct.     The reaction was that we are under-spending and that they are going to withdraw the amounts of amount that we have because we cannot lose out on that money just because we are not spending, because we don’t give – the performance of province.     My apologies, I thought that my voice was audible, I will try to be louder.       What I was just saying is that that situation meant that the National Department of Human Settlements that informing us that we are down-scheduled in terms of our performance and therefore they said to us we will give you notice that we are going to withdraw a particular amount from your budget, which you are not going to get, we are going to withhold it in the National Department so that it can be given to other provinces that are performing, so that is what I wanted to say.     As far as I can recall it the two key things that need us not to perform at that stage, the first one was that we had advertised the tender, we closed the tender and did all the processes only to find out we took too long and the validity period expired, so that was the first part.  The second part ...[intervenes]      The period of the tender expired.     The other part as far as I can recollect is that we heard as we came in that decision that was before us they had allocated or they had got into the budget of 09 and the budget of 2010 so they had already appointed contractors, so those contractors had taken us to court, so that was delaying us as well, so those are the two things that I can recollect that delayed us before October 2010.     That is correct.     I can’t recall right now what was the delay but I think we had too many tenders, we had too many tenders that were coming, that came in and so I think the delay was in processing those tenders.     In October 2010 there was a speci8al meeting called by Mr Zwane, who was our MEC at that stage, he called to say that he wanted us to meet because he had a solution, or a problem of non-spending on the grant.     This meeting he organised in his boardroom, the meeting took place in his boardroom.     In Bloemfontein.     In the meeting mainly it was my managers, and the CFO we were still sharing, the CFO at that stage we had our CFO was also the CFO for Local Government, that was Ms Sepati and under ...[intervenes]      Ms Sepati Dlamini ja, and then it was Ms Manite Mogele on my side and then on the side of the MEC’s office it was ...[indistinct] who was the advisor to the MEC at that stage and then also from the MEC’s side was Ms ...[indistinct] Motahu who was the MEC’s PA, and then on my side also there was Mr Kaizer Maxatshwa and Mr Koloi, Kabelo Koloi     That is correct.     As far as I can recollect it was in October indeed Chair.     The purpose of the meeting was to come and listen to his proposed solution to our problem.     Our problem was that we are not spending on our human settlement grant.     The solution was proposed by the MEC, Mr Zwane.     As far as I could ask in the meeting I realised that he was saying that he also got an advice, that’s why he came with that, he got advice, expert advice but there was asking him who is this advisor, where did you get this advice from, he did not want to mention, because as a person who was working with almost all departments, all provinces I would have known who might have spoken to him about it, because for me it was illegal, and what is worse is that as I am sitting in the meeting the tensions that – I am the only one who is asking questions of clarity who is talking to him, as if the meeting is between me and him and all others are quiet, so I think that for me said that it looks like there was a discussion before, all those who were in the meeting with me knew about what was going to proposed in the meeting, and I was the only one who didn’t know about what was going to be proposed in the meeting.     That could also be a possibility but just for example when it comes to the CFO, the CFO is – the CFO’s strong point is supply chain management, issues of procurement is known more by the CFO than us as HOD’s, so I expected the CFO to come in and say this is illegal in terms of the procurement because even from that side I didn’t get any support.     Exactly.     The solution was that we must go out and buy materials, building material, for the service providers so that service providers cannot be held up in terms of getting on the ground, getting on site to start working faster, that was his way of putting this solution in front of us.     At that stage no, he didn’t mention any invoices.      Okay, you are saying that his plan was we will get these materials and these materials will be managed in the way that the contractors would get the invoices and then go to the material suppliers, get the invoices from the material suppliers and then come back to us and we signed with them and ensure that they get materials delivered to them, but not in too much details, I was just saying that there must be some invoices that must show that how material or building material that must go out.      I think at this stage we were still was talking to him and because I was so in my uncomfort on the legality of the process.     Then we are agreed that – he said that he was going to send Mr Tsoamatsi to go and do further research because I was adamant this is illegal.     ...[Indistinct – speaking simultaneously.    Thank you.  When we got to the meeting in the board room, he gave us his    As far as I could…    As far as I can recall it was only me and the MEC.    They were not required.    Metsi.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    The instruction came from the MEC.  Because Mr Tsoametsi was the advisor to the MEC.    No it was not.    Tsoametsi.    Let me hasten to say I can correct it.  I hear the Chairperson.    Because we did not get to know who is this person who advised the MEC.    To come with this – with this plan.    If he did not mention it and now, he is asking – his tasking Mr Tsoametsi to go and do the research.    They spoke before the meeting.    You are correct.    I withdraw that part.    That is correct.    As far as I am aware the task to Tsoametsi came from the MEC from the meeting in the board room which was a response to my questioning the legality and the illegality of the plan.    That is correct Chair.    That is exactly the document we are talking about.    That is correct.    That is correct.    To my knowledge this is the only document that was prepared.  This went from the MEC’s meeting in the board room to ensure that we implement his plan.  These are the only document.    And Chair.    Chair you are correct.  But sometimes there are things that are happening on the ground that are not necessarily according to how things should be traditionally.  He came to work into the MEC’s office as an advisor.  He was residence inside the MEC’s office.  But then sometimes a position that he was holding according to the structure of the department were the DDG post.  So sometimes that for an example as I was the HOD the DDG for my Human    But she was working somewhere else.    Outside.    It only had one DDG post which was occupied by a person who was not handling anything to do with Human Settlements.    So I just – I was just using an example about the conflating of the DDG Tsoametsi as the post in the structure as against him working in the MEC’s office advising the MEC.    That is true.    That is true.    DDG.    That is correct Chairperson.    In the MEC’s office.  Because the MEC was the MEC for both departments.    He was the MEC for Local Government as well as the MEC for Human Settlements.    He was occupying a DDG post in Local Government.    But working in the MEC’s office.    Exactly.    That is correct.    Yes.    Thanks very much.  Immediately after the meeting when everyone stands up to go out of the meeting – out of the board room then I got – I approached the MEC and say MEC can we have a word please?  Then we go back into the board room; we sit down.  I still say to him that  1. I feel like the plan that you are bringing is illegal. 2. I thought that we are going to work as we traditionally used to.  When he has got an issue, he calls me as the HOD we talk first about it so that when we talk to other colleagues in my department then at least I know what it is they are going to be talking about. That is the protocol traditional that we have been using in the Province but he did not approach it that way.  So that was the two issues that I wanted to raise with him.  And then what happened is that he said then to me, look we have discussed about this.  This is my plan and it is going to happen.  We are going to implement it.  But if you have a problem with it you just submit your resignation letter and know that once you have submitted your resignation letter you will get out on the street and you will be poor.  Your house will be taken back by the banks.  Your car.  Your children will be out of school and he stood up and left me    Yes he used a Sotho expression.    That expression in Sotho he was saying that …    It was something like [African language] meaning that you will be poor, you will be like grey; like dust [African language].  So meaning that he is saying what is going to happen to me after I have resigned.    He said it was the three that was going to be in abject poverty in short.    Yes that is exactly the – when I – [African language].  So I translate it here into figuratively and not – literally as he said it.    Because I wanted it to be understood the way he was putting it.    In Sotho he was saying [African language].  Meaning that you will be walking next to your shoes you will not walk in your shoes.  There will be no shoes to walk in in other words.    Yes. That is what I was trying to say.  That is why I wanted to capture it in that way so that I do not forget it.    Yes.    It was obvious that he was saying that I must resign because I do not want to implement his plan.  So it was a threat to keep me out of the post I was in or out of the job.  Simply that is how I understood it.    He said I must submit…    My resignation.    That is correct.    That is correct.    The document was brought to me in my office by Mr Tsoametsi.    I went through the document.  I read the document.  I still had – I still was uncomfortable.    Not at all.  That is what – that is what frustrated me therefore I said to him no I cannot agree with this document it is still not saying anything about the legality and the illegality of this plan.  Then he took the document went back to the office and then – the MEC called me.  As I got in there he said, have you changed your plan?  Are you going to submit your resignation letter now?  Then I realised that what you are saying to me is that earlier on I said you must submit your resignation letter if you do not want to go with this plan.  Now he is talking about the plan again.  So it    That is correct Chair.    It was the 25t h.    Yes Chair.    The purpose was for me to sign and approve it.    For implementation.    As what to be done.    Exactly.    We did.  We discussed it.    I did.    He could not convince me.    He tried to persuade me but it was empty because if you give a document the document does not say what you should be saying.    I cannot listen to what you are saying which is not in the document.    Because it will incorrect.    So then we – I did not agree with him then he took the document he went back to the MEC’s office.    We could not agree so he left.    He left the office.  Without me agreeing.    Then I got a call to come to the MEC’s office.    Immediate.  Immediately.  When I got to the MEC’s office the MEC is asking me why I am not signing the document.  I said no I am not comfortable with that document.  He said but….    I had made it clear to him.    That is why he went to the MEC.    I told him that this document is not telling me anything that shows that this is legal in terms of us implementing it.    He said this is my plan you either sign this sign this document or you submit my letter.  I asked you a letter earlier on but if you do not agree with me on my plan submit your resignation letter.    So I think when I heard that I realised that okay it means he is still putting me into the same corner.     No it was now only me and the MEC.    I think Mr Tsoametsi had left the document with the MEC.    He came with one document.    He came with one that is why he left with that same one.    Yes Chair.    Resignation letter yes.    In the light of that I thought that he was saying to me so if you do not sign then bring me my letter.    I think that is what he was saying.  So for me they are saying I must resign.    We concluded the meeting by me signing.  I signed that document.    Inside of – in front of him.    Yes.    Because I had to resign if I do not want to sign the document.    I think that did not come my way because for me it was only – it is either you go with my plan or you resign.  I looked at it as either or.  I did not look at the other way in between.      Yes I knew.    Yes.    I know Chair.    I think that is what I should have done but I missed on it because I thought that if I do not sign it it means I must come with my resignation letter to him.    Because that was for the second time now that he is telling me to bring this – one letter if I do not go with him according to his plan.  So for me I think my – my thinking – my flow of thoughts was now locked on two things.  It is either I submit your resignation letter and go or you sign the document and then the plan goes.    Correct.    That is correct.    Three weeks yes.    That is correct.    No houses have been built by this time still.    This now is in November yes.    The …    Yes he approached me with a list of contractors a week later.  He said here is the list of my contractors that I want you to approve.  I want you to call to come in so that they start implementing construction of these houses.    It was only contractors on that list.    My glance on the list was that I saw many companies that I saw for the first time. I know the persons who have been working in the Province for years.  I could realise that no there is something wrong here.  When I asked him why do you have so many new contractors with so many units because for us a new contractor would give 200 and less not more than 200.  He said this is my plan.  This is the document that I have the power to allocate and these are the people I am allocating to.    He has power to allocate he is the political – is the executive authority’s power.  It is not the DG’s power.    Construction job.    As MEC yes they have got power to allocate projects to contractors.    Well he – but tradition would have been – been all along of that.  We used to prepare a list where the other MEC’s before him looking at the performance which either contractors were not performing and then try to grade    That is correct Chair.    According to our recommendation that we have submitted. We were the ones who were…    It originates with us as officials it goes to the MEC.  That is how we used to do it with all other MEC’s before him.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Before Mr Zwane it was Mr Mafereka.    Yes.    With Mr Zwane we did not because he said he was going to do it himself.    Yes his own list.    That is his list.  That is correct.     Just a practise, yes.     On the procurement.     That is correct.     That is true.     It is a practise, not law.  You are correct.     Yes.     That is correct.  He gave me an instruction.      Correct.     Thank you.  My argument and as well as our colleagues always would say that if you want to have performance so that we always get better percentage in terms of budget at national, we must perform better.   So we must allocate more units to the best performing contractors in the province.  So that is what I raised with him     And so then, I had to go and sit down and look at all of them and then I checked with my team and they said but they also did not know most of the contractors on the list.     It was on a paper.     That is correct.     That was my understanding Chair.     The units were already allocated.     All 106.     Complete.  That is correct.     Correct Chair.     Well, after that you have to start calling those contractors to come in.     Oh.     Yes?     That list came to me.  I had to implement it.     I had to give it to our Project Management Unit to start now calling those people and ensuring that they get onsite in different municipalities so that we can steer up the process.     Unfortunately, I did not take any document when I left the office, you know, in the province.     It was typed.     The names were typed.     And the units were typed.     Not signed.     Certain list did not have any space for signing.     It was on a ...[intervenes]      ...plain paper.     Yes, Chair.     That is true.     The MEC said that he is going to work with us and ensure that he goes on the ground to speed up the process.  You can change that document so if anything, that is improved.  In fact, we help the contractors to deliver quickly.       He was not amenable to revise it.     He said as much.     That is correct.     That is correct.     It could be around ...[intervenes]      Many of them.     I may not recall out of the 106.     If I see the list, I can tick them.  I can highlight them.     I think there might have been around 40/45.     That I have never seen before.     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, it was not followed.     It was a mixture.     Because it looks like he took from the list of those... the tenders that expired.     As well as from the CSD, from the Central Database.  It was taken from all over.     Others were not appearing anywhere.     They not appearing in the database, they are not appearing in our provincial list.     Those contractors that we used every year and they were not also appearing on the tender.  So when we looked at them, it was such a mix.     That is correct.  We used that.     That is true Chair.     At this stage, I think... I started in 1995.     Almost 15-years, yes.     That is correct.     That is true.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Thank you, Chair.     That is true.     I cannot remember Chair.     Thank you.  As they were implementing the project or his plan, we realised that there were three companies that were very close to him.  Close to him, I mean, when our guys go on site, we find them in those and not many times in other projects but many times in these projects.       ...[intervenes]      They were close.     It was just a physical closeness.     Not just the physical closeness but the functional closeness in terms of the ...[intervenes]      Ja, I say so because there were these from Mpumelelo, from the area where he comes from.  Number 1 and number 2.  When we were going around in different areas on Operation Hlasela Programme, the premier, as I have earlier alluded, would allocate or announce some new sporadic allocations.   And then you realise that at the end of the day, the people are based in the Free State.  The contractors that were given those jobs of Operation Hlasela houses were these three.   I think of Harrismith.  I think of Senekal and I think Vrede.  So on top of the allocation that they are in the list, this is where they were carrying also under the allocations from Operation Hlasela Project.   And also, the third point.  I think, Aleatory and Quinoa were also allocated the Restitution Housing Project in Ode(?).  So it means, it the most three layers that makes me think that it means there is some kind of closeness here.       That is correct.     Yes, he was the one allocating there.     And maybe sometimes me and him were saying to the premier that we do not have subsidies.  You must not allow this.  Even sometimes when the premier announced, he comes back again to allocate those to him, his close companies.   So it means, he is just saying to me, we are together.  By saying to the premier we do not have any budget for these allocations but give it some time.  He goes back to use the same thing that he was doing to allocate for himself these contractors.     Chairperson, for me, if you allocate so many units, the newly established contractors, not just that the overbearing them, it means also that there is something that brings you close to them.  Although I cannot vouch.  We have not seen anything but it means there is also some benefits that comes from that.     Yes.     Yes.  But I think there should have been a benefit.     That is my assumption.     No evidence about that.     Yes.     Okay that was on the subsidy section on that list.     So wherever they were building with these contractors and contractor in Kroonstad, they would call me and say, this contractor that submitted their claims, make sure that you speed up their claims.  Speed up the processing of those claims.   But with other contractors it was not coming to us to pressurise us to ask us to expedite the processing.       Not at all.  Not at all Chair.     My conclusion was that there was a relationship that was beyond just a functional procedure.  That is, I was talking about benefits.     Yes, I have already given this evidence about the projects.     That is true.     Their performance.     Not at all.     [No audible reply]      In the last part of 22, all I am saying there is that these six contractors, when you look at the span of the work that they were doing, they were doing more than 500 per contractor per day but they knew.   And for me within that capacity to do, to deliver on this, I think it is just because they wanted more money to be reallocated to them because at that time, the subsidy house was roundabout R 55 000,00 per unit.       R 55 000,00 per RDP unit.     Yes, Chair.     Five hundred multiply by ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     It is.     Mainly from November after the signing of that document of 25 November.     As the plan was implemented in a way that the advertise(?) contract.  It needs the material supplier.  Will have a contract... will enter into a contract with the department as well as with the contractor through the cessions.   So they start delivering the materials to the contractor on site and then when the... when we pay... when the contractor claims and the money goes back to the material supplier because the material supplier supplies.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Yes, that is true.     That is true.     That is why I had reservations from the beginning because I knew that when it comes to invoices, you can never be sure about any invoice that we are getting because some invoices will be inflated, the prices will be changed from area to area, from region to region.   So I think I had a fear that we were not going to be able to control that because if we have enough stuff, we have enough technical people.  So the authenticity of these invoices was always a reservation for me.     Yes.     That is true.     That is true.     That is true.     Will pay the material supplier.     That is true.     And whether the material and the invoice are in sync.     That is where the problem was.     If we had capacity we could check.     That is true.     I think that is what our technical people were doing with the contractors.     To get all the materials that he needed from this material supplier according to this invoice.     Because the invoice were brought to us by the contractors from the material suppliers.     They checked that part.     That is true.     Correct, Chair.     That is true.     Were not always available.     That is correct.     I think that is exactly the problem that we had because we were still a new department.  We did not have sufficient staff, sufficient capacity that could do this very well.  So I was right in the beginning not in agreement with this type of plan to be implemented because it overwhelmed us.     H’m.     That is true.     That is true.     That is true.     That is correct.     That is true.     Yes.     No, they were not ...[intervenes]      Ja, that was my concern.  Yes.     Rounding it off to R 500 million.  That was first a bit below R 500 million.     That is correct.     The purpose of spending the money was to ensure that this money is not withheld by the Department of Human Settlements.  It was to circumvent that, according to him.     That is correct.     Yes.     226?     Yes, sir.     I do.     It was our expenditure recovery plan.     This document came to exist after we had started working through our war room.     Okay.     That is correct.     Compiled around October.     Yes.      That is correct.     Ja, you have got me there.  I think the projections were made with the understanding that we are going to speed up in terms of getting our capacity but we were thinly stretched, I must agree.  If you do not have a capacity in technical circumstances you do not have sufficient capacity in project management, we are not going to get to that level.  I think this is the amount that was allocated to us, we were trying to work from the allocation backwards.     1.2.     Exactly.      That is some kind of a map for us.     It was not realistic.  Not realistic.     Chair, I think here we were working without being focused.  I think here we were working based on the funds that we have and to say from these funds what are the things that we could do and then we looked at dividing the milestones of payments per unit, foundations – so many foundations, this is how much we can spend.  Then when we come to expenditure on the whole place, if you can build so many whole places, how much you can pay.  So I think it was helping us in terms of looking at what are the tangible milestones that we could achieve.  But we knew that we are not going to spend the whole 1 billion.     You are correct, Chair.     I thinking we taking an exercise(?) trying to look at when we throw our eyes(?) right at the end and say we wanted to have so many – or build so many foundations, so many units by March.  If we cannot achieve that, where else are we going to fall to?  We were looking at it in terms of projection and rather(?) than in terms of what we can achieve.  I agree that it is not practical.       Given the time and the capacity that we had.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Yes, it was.     That is true.  That is true.     We did, we knew.     I do not have an answer for that.     I do not have an answer for that, Chair.     It was wrong.     That was wrong, Chair, I agree.     I am sorry about that, we should not have misrepresented the facts.     Because we did not have capacity for this, that we put in here.     Thank you.     That is true.     Chairperson, I know that in life there are other – there are decisions that you make that you say I am correcting this decision but the other decision that you make that you realise that on hindsight, this decision I should not have taken because now I can see that – the wrongs that came out of that decision, worse than if I said no.  If I said no to this, we could have saved this money, some houses would have been built in other provinces because we are also gaining from other provinces that were not building, were not performing.  Because we are smaller province but our budget was bigger because in the years that we have been building, we have been performing, building about 9 000 to 10 000 units every year.     So that is how we are getting this money, which was bigger than other provinces that were almost our size, Mpumalanga and North West.  We are getting money more than them.  So I am sorry about that, I think this should not have happened.     In hindsight I think I should not have taken that decision.     Correct, Chair, I took leave in December.     The instruction of the MEC was that no one must take leave for December vacation because he wanted us to implement this plan.  But as we have spoken, that this plan came in October and my leave, specially the cruise that I was taking, we had already paid – we paid in June, so the plan was done six months before so I could not cancel it because if I cancelled it, I was going to lose out on the money I had paid.     I took leave.     I appointed Mr Kaizer Maxatshwa.     Mr Zwane’s response was that he cannot work with Mr Maxatshwa, he does not want me to appoint Mr Maxatshwa to act, he wants me to appoint Ms Maniki(?) Mokhele to act on my behalf.     And I had to do that, Chair.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct.     It was approved by Maniki Mokhele.     Chairperson, in summary, what I am saying here is that after then all this, implementing this plan, the only thing that we could say we could have done, there was not a single project that was completed.  Instead we had many more foundations in different areas in the province rather than complete houses and too few  were built(?).  So for me we did not achieve anything in terms of complete projects although we spent so much money on materials that we bought and in the running up and down paying for the officials to go and do inspections and all that but we did not achieve what we were supposed to achieve.  That is in short what I was saying about our performing.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, it should not be like that.     There is only one post.  I had appointed Maxatshwa but I could not go back to him physically and get the letter back.     So I had to write another letter, another acting letter for Maniki Mokhele, so therefore there were two letters of acting but I contacted Mr Maxatshwa and said no, that the MEC has asked me to withdraw your letter of acting and give Maniki Mokhele a letter of acting.  So he was aware, I informed him.  But the letter physically is still with him. So that is why I am saying officially …[intervenes]     No, Chairperson.     Only one person.     Mokhele, that is true, Chair.     That is correct.     That is true, Chair.  Correct.     Ms Mokhele.     That is correct.  I think he was just showing that where I had two sent letters to two different people at the same time although I had already spoken to Mr Maxatshwa that he was not the one who was acting.     But because of the MEC who does not want to work with this person, that he wants to work with that person, for me I think it was not correct because they are both working in his department.     Thank you, Chair.     That is correct.     There were no completed houses, that is correct.     Chair, I must say in meetings at National Department they realised that I had this problem and NURCHA was part of us in those meetings where I was putting our position that we have a problem, we do not have capacity in terms of monitoring our project.  When NURCHA came to us and said we are here to help you then we signed an SLA with NURCHA, then they started helping us, working very closely in our war room because we wanted to build our own capacity in that way.  Thank you, Chair.     That is correct.     No, this meeting was held in the honourable Minister ’s office in Pretoria.     I am not sure.     As far as I can recall it was myself, our new CFO, the late Mr Hattingh and Mr Tsoametsi, Muso, from the officials’ side and then the MEC himself and in the meeting at National it was then himself, Mr Sexwale and the Director General Mr Thabane Zulu.      The purpose of the meeting was the Minister wanted to talk to us about this delivery model that we were implementing.  That was the purpose of the meeting.  He wanted us to discuss it.     Prepaying of material.     He said he does not agree with this, we must stop it immediately, he was not aware that this was happening, he only got word of it in January but now must not continue, we must stop where we are which was February when we met him and we agreed that February month end we will never hand out any further advance on building materials.     That is correct.     I think when we were still submitting our recommended strategy, which was recovery plan, they rejected it.     We continued nevertheless.     No, we did not.     It was including MEC Zwane.     He also agreed.     Yes, in the meeting he engaged the Minister about the legality of the plan and all that.   We discussed and the Minister said no, I will not agree to it.  I hear you but this is not correct.     He did try in the meeting but he did not succeed – we did not succeed, in fact.     No, he did not refer to any document.     Okay.  No, he did not mention the document, he just spoke about his plan without mentioning the document.      He did not mention the document in the meeting.     Okay.     That is correct.     Ja.     That is correct.     That happened.     He found out.     That is not correct, I think I should pull up the reference, I think I was summarising what you are saying, he was talking about this document as a way of trying to debate with the Minister but without saying that we have a document.  He did not mention it.  So it [indistinct] 27.17 wanted to show what I am talking about here.     I inferred it.     It does.     Correct it.  Okay, thank you, Chair.     I gave that undertaking in that meeting.     And I stopped those payments in February 2011.     No.  After February 2011?     Let us see if I can be reminded.     No because during the time when there were contractors coming to my office with material suppliers, it was after February and I told them that I will not sign anything, this is has stopped.  So I am surprised if that happened.     Okay, here what I am saying is that although it came from the meeting at National with the agreement and the undertaking that we will not give out new contracts in terms of advance for materials for the projects the MEC, when we got home, started asking me to allocate to new then I said no, we cannot do that.  I think that is what I was mentioning here is that he wanted us to continue although we had made an undertaking that we were going to stop this system.  I think maybe I did not put it correctly there.     All that I am trying to say is that coming from the meeting where we took an undertaking – we made an undertaking with the Minister that we are going to stop this scheme of advance ...[intervenes]      Advance payments.     Then ...[indistinct] came to me after that, asking me to do that revenue contractors, then I said no ...[intervenes]      Yes to continue with this scheme.     And I said no.     And then we stopped there.     He didn’t try further.    But here I think what I was saying here is what we have already mentioned that there were contractors in his list that were close to him.  I think I might have misplaced it here because we had already discussed it on the other side.   I am sorry about that.     He insisted that we must continue with the scheme.     Yes.     For the regular nature yes we had – we continued with that. ADV PRETORIUS     Those payments, we didn’t agree to any new contract after that, after February month.     No.     That is correct.     Thank you Chair. 
MR MAKOENA:   That is correct, it would have been on issues like foundations for instance, not a full house, just a few foundations.     That is true.     And I am sure about that.     Okay I think I am running ahead of myself.      Yes, okay I get the point.   By October ...[intervenes]      That less than 10% was not on product, it was because we didn’t have a service provider, so it was not on product.     It was not on houses yet.     I can’t recall but it might have been on ...[indistinct] as well as ...[intervenes]      It was not on houses.     I am sure about that. 
MOKOENA: What happened then was that ...[intervenes]    The payment scheme and then ...[intervenes]
