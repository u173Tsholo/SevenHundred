CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody.    Yes are we ready?    Yes.    Hm.    Mr X the oath you took yesterday continues to apply.  You understand that?    Okay thank you.    I am sorry.  I think Ms Interpreter you may have missed something.  Ms Hofmeyr said she wants to know from him the general process that he would follow when he had received money from – or when the money had come into his account.    So it is the process in general and then later on they will go into details of each one.  It is the process followed after he had received money before money would be paid over to the account designated by Mr Majola.  No, no, no.      Yes go ahead.    Please repeat your answer Mr Majola and then Ms Interpreter you can just listen carefully.    Did you say earlier on if he would tell you if he would be busy and then you would wait for him?    Maybe Ms Hofmeyr.    Just to complete the process.  What would he usually say when he did get a chance to come back to you?  Would he say he would be coming to the office so that an invoice – or would he tell you the account number where to pay the money into or would he come back to you and say something else?    Would he sometimes come – would he sometimes say he was going to see you and then he would come and see you and sometimes he would just call you and give you the account number?   Yes please raise your voice Mr X.    Oh he would not tell you the account number over the phone?    So as far as you can recall all the time he brought the account number to you and it would be written in a piece of paper?    Okay and then after that has happened – hadhappened what would you then do or what would your office do?    Would you give that instruction to your secretary?    Would that be – would it be her all the time or did you sometimes give the instruction to somebody else?    You would give the instruction to any one of them, is that right?    Yes.  Was your daughter working in your office?    Ja.  How – how – do you know how long it would takenormally for the – for your secretary or your daughter to pay the money into the account designated by Mr Majola after you had given the instructions or after Mr Majola had dropped the information about the account?      Ja.    Is Mr X asking for confirmation whether we want to know the time between he had – after he had given instructions to the time of payment or is he confirming that the payment would be immediate after he had given instructions?    Yes.  I am – the question was, from the time when you gave – you would give instructions to your secretary or yourdaughter to pay the money to the time when your secretary or your daughter paid the money, how much time would that take?  Would it be a day, would it be two day, would it be a week?    Thank you.    Okay thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr.    394?   R2 394 000.00.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    One – one second.  Ms Interpreter.    You must feel free to stop him.    So that you can interpret because otherwise he might tell a long story and when you interpret you cannot remembereverything.    Okay maybe let us start afresh.    Yes please.    Yes ja, no.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  Do explain.    Okay.  Yes okay.    No I think check – I think the instruction is for – iswhere to pay that money but paying it into the – his business account is just for his convenience for his business purposes.  The instruction is where he should pay the amount – the money.  Mr X do you hear me?    The instruction you are talking about would that be an instruction to tell you where to pay the supplier’s money – into which account?    The instruction does not relate to you bringing your – the money from the Money Market account into your business account,is that right?    I think do – do interpret.    The R1 million that was transferred out to Safeza Kohnke is part of the R1 002 000.00 that you had transferred from or had been transferred from Money Market into your business account, is that right?    Okay.    Ja.    Well that is what has misled me.    Because I have been wondering where …    Mr Shange’s affidavit is.    So …    Ja.    Will that be corrected?    Ja.  The file containing the affidavits - actually should we not have Mr Khan’s affidavit as - give it one exhibit maybe.   Number 28A …    And then Mr Shange’s one …    A different exhibit number.    Are there two of - of Mr Khan’s one?    Hm.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Oh.    Does the supplement only have annexures or it …?    It does?    Maybe let us do it as 28A and 28B.    So Mr Noffel Khan’s main affidavit, would that …    Be correct which was deposed to …   On 4 December 2019 and its annexures will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT DD28A and his supplementary affidavit deposed to …    On 12 December 2019 and annexures to it will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT 28 - DD28B.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.  Mr Kolani Shange’s affidavit deposed to on 16 January 2020 and annexures to it will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT DD28C.    The affidavit of Mr Colin Gordon Paton and annexures will - will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT DD28D.   Hm.    He says he is the Managing Director of Klomac Engineering (Pty) Ltd.  Just translate that Ms Interpreter.    Do you not have …?    Oh.  I thought you …    I thought you have - you must be given that.   Oh.    Yes.    Hm.    And go to page 150 towards the end.  Right at the end actually.    It is the affidavit of Mr Colin Gordon Paton.    You found it.  Ja.  Okay.  What Ms Hofmeyr sought Mr X to confirm is what is in paragraph 1.    And in the meantime you confirm that not only have you not met Mr Paton, but also you have never spoken to himtelephonically?    You have - you have had no communication with him at all?    Okay.  Thank you.    Ja, read it.  Ja.  Yes.    That is fine.  Ja.    Yes.  I think - I think he said he was waiting for thosedocuments included in an appointment letter.  Is that what you said?    Yes.    Hm.   No.  We have not actually.    We started early.    Ja.    Yes.    Require that.    Yes.  Ja.    Ja.  No.  That is fine.   Okay.  I think - I think you must just repeat the number.  The amount - 866 000.  Yes.    Okay.  Do you want to …    Translate that portion?  Ja.     You have never met but did you ever speak to them, did you ever communicate with them in any manner whatsoever?     Both amounts?     Ja, you can explain.    Do you mean that in your company at Isibonelo you don’t do cash withdrawals exceeding R10 000?     Okay and you say that these – you say these cash withdrawals of R30 000 and R100 000 you say that they were requested by Mr Majola, is that because of the large amounts as you say or do you have a clear recollection that Mr Majola requested you to withdraw these specific amounts?     No it’s fine, let’s ask him to repeat himself.     Yes, continue Mr X.     Yes thank you.     Let’s get the number right.  The amount is R917 940.54.     Okay.     Yes okay, I’m wondering whether we should just use it as a tea break.     We are quite close to it ja.   Okay, let us take a tea break, after all we started earlier than normal.    It is five to eleven now, let us resume at quarter past eleven.     Yes, let’s proceed.     And 28 on mine.     Once again do you confirm that the amount of R401 328 relates to according to the invoice to servicing air-conditioners?     Ms Interpreter I just want to say if yesterday and early this morning it looked like there were challenges in yourinterpretation, I think you have since improved considerably,  you are doing quite well now.     Okay, alright.     When your daughter had withdrawn the money would she meet with Mr Majola to hand over the cash sometimes or would the position be that all the time she would hand over the money to you and you would be the one to give the money to Mr Majola?     Thank you.     I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr just to conclude on that invoice.     Do you confirm Mr X that the total amount on that invoice is R2 280 000?    And that is the invoice issued by Isibonelo Construction to SSOJV?     Thank you Ms Hofmeyr.       And, I am sorry, you confirm that the document we are looking at is a statement from the Standard Bank account of Isibonelo Construction?     Thank you.     I am sorry, I am sorry Miss Hofmeyr I wonder whetheryou should not consider later on, highlighting it in a different colour those items, those amounts that he says where his.     Yes – yes.    Ja.     Ja that is fine.     Sorry.     Did you get that date right?     Okay, I think there was a reference to 05.    Before you proceed, okay just continue.    Before you proceed, Miss Hofmeyr I think it would be convenient if we can have the total amount of all the amounts that he says were paid into Isibonelo’s account in accordance with Mr Majola’s instructions and the total amount that was paid out so that we have the big picture. .     If it is not ready let us do it before he finishes his evidence      Ja if they can work – work out so that we have a picture of the total amount, ja.     Okay.     Sorry.     Just to make sure there is complete understanding, when you say Premier, you refer to Premier Attraction, is that correct?     Actually, you refer to Premier Attraction 1016CC.  Is that correct?      Premier Attraction 1016CC.       I think what Ms Hofmeyr wants to know is whether he knows whose account number that is.      Yes.   Mm.    Premier Attraction.  Ja, just get it right.  Okay.    I am sorry.  There was a reference to young lions or something like that.  Mr X what were you talking about in relation to young lions?   Oh okay.    Oh okay.  Okay well ... (intervenes)    It sounded like (African Language) which would be young lions so I was very interested.  Okay alright.   Maybe we should just say Premier Attraction at least.    Because we do not want anybody who reads the transcripts thinking we are talking about a Premier.    Ja.    I am sorry.  Before that, has he confirmed his knowledge of the relationship between Mr Thalente Myeni and Ms Duduzile Myeni?  If he has not maybe we should get that out of the way.    Because in the affidavit he has got there.    Ja.    African Language.  Okay alright.   Yes.    Would you always hide it in her office or in that part of the house that she used as her office?  Or would you sometimes hide it elsewhere in the house?    Did you always hide it in the same spot or did you change the spot where you hid it?    Yes.  And did you say that sometimes you would hide it in the office in the one house and sometimes you would hide it in theoffice in the other house?    So is the position that during the period that we are talking about namely 2015.  At some stage she lived in one house and at another stage she lived in another house?   Okay.  So, it is not that she had two houses to which you had access at the same time.    So, would it be correct to say she used or you used-you hid the money in one house at a time and she stayed in one house at a time?    Thank you.    Before Ms Hofmeyr I ask the next question.  Mr X who came up with the idea that the money should be hidden in her office?    And did you discuss it – the idea with her?   Oh you just thought of the idea and you hid the money and you told her afterwards where you had hidden it?    But she was fine with that I hear?    Thank you.    And maybe this is the time to go back to the beginning.  Prior to you discovering these amounts that had come into your account from Premier Attraction had anybody spoken to you that there would be some amounts that would be transferred into your account – into your – or company’s account?    And when you discovered the first payment how soon did you discover it after it had been transferred into your company’s account if you are able to remember?    Yes let me repeat.    When you discovered the first payment are you able to remember how long after the payment had been made into your account that you discovered it?    Yes okay.  Thank you.    Just ask him to repeat his answer?    Well the way he put it earlier on was that they would – that a period of about two days or so would pass while they were watching it.    Yes.  How far are you from finishing?    Ja.    Ja.   Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Look at the application.    Ja.    Yes.  No that is fine.  So we – we should adjourn now.  Should we resume at two or should we resume a little later than two?    Maybe quarter past two.    Yes.    To give more time.    Yes okay alright.  I think counsel for Mr Majola does not have a problem with that?    Yes.  Thank you.   Thank you.  Okay we – we are going to adjourn now and then we will resume at quarter past two.  So Mr X do come back at quarter past two.      We adjourn.    I think we must dispose of the postponementapplication …    Because I do not need any argument and I understand you do not oppose.    Ja.  Counsel for Mr Majola, do you want to come forward to the podium and move the application from here?    Come here, ja.    Ja.  I understand when you speak from anywhere else there is a challenge with recording and transcribing or the recording, ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Yes.  Yes and basically I understand that one, because Mr Majola received the affidavit of Mr X only yesterday.  Is that right?    Yes.    Yes.  He - he needs more time …    To look at it and then to give instructions, but also he fell ill …    This - today or still yesterday.  I am not sure.  From the affidavit it seems that he was seen by a doctor or has beenhospitalised since this morning or since yesterday.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes.  Yes.  Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    No.  That is fine.  I grant the application for the postponement of the hearing of Mr Majola’s evidence to a date to be determined.  So the Commission’s legal team will be in touch with you about a new date.    Okay.    Thank you.  Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no.    You are excused.    Thank you.  Thank you.    Yes.  Let - let us proceed.  Yes.    When - when Ms Myeni gave you the account numberto which you were to transfer this amount.  Did she not tell you who the holder of the account was?    Do you remember whether Ms Myeni told you theaccount number telephonically or whether she met with you and gave you a document or piece of paper?    Was it - did she do the same thing when she gave you other account numbers?  She - did she give you only account numbers and did not tell you the identity of the account number?    In each case?    Ja.  Just repeat your answer?    (No audible reply).    Yes.  So are you saying to the best of your recollection whenever she gave you an account number in which to transfer money or to put money she would just give you the account number without give you the name of the account holder?   Yes.  Were you not keen to find out from her who the account holder would be in each case or was it because you were going to find out anyway when you make the deposit or transfer?    When you refer to the children are you referring to your secretary and your daughter?    Well the fact that you are not or you would not be able to use technology to get the names of the account holders.  Iwould have imagined would have made you more curious and ask her who the account holder was.    And you - and you did not ask her?    No, no.  I mean you did not ask your secretary whothe account holder was in each case.    I get the impression that you were not so interested in knowing who the money was being paid to.  Is that right?    Okay.  Thank you.  Ms Hofmeyr.     Do you confirm what has been said to you as coming out of the last paragraph at page 24 Mr X?.     Okay.    Have you ever been asked to make a donation to the Jacob Zuma Foundation?     Yes.     Before you do so Ms Hofmeyr if you are able to now you could just let us know what the total is that was received from Premier Attraction by Isibonelo, is it three transactions.      Yes, and then he can confirm it, or you can do that later, as long as you are taking some steps.     Yes, yes, no that is in order.     Ja, that’s okay.    I think put it differently, the question is whether it was possible that Isibonelo Construction may have done work for Premier Attraction without him knowing that Isibonelo Construction did work for Premier Attraction?Okay, okay, I think the problem is when you ...[indistinct].Okay let’s start again, Mr X is there any work that your company Isibonelo Construction, could do for anybody without you knowing that your company is doing work for that person?     Yes, what is your position in Isibonelo if you are able to say that, but if you think disclosing that might not be appropriate for your safety then you must tell me but if you feel you can then you can tell me.     Yes, so anyone who gets your company to do work for them you would know about that work, is that right?     Okay.  I hope ...     Would you have any reason not to have kept the money if you had done work and had been paid for doing work?     Thank you.     Mr X did Ms Dudu Myeni have your daughter’s number before this day when she called her.  As far as you know had she called her before and so on?     But do you know for sure that she had called, Ms Dudu Myeni had called your daughter before this day?     Is that – are you talking about a call between yourdaughter Mr Myeni?.     And did you check the number on your daughter’s cell phone by any chance?     Yes, okay.   Now when these amounts that you had testified about were deposited or transferred into your company’s account did you say  you never asked Mr Majola why it was necessary that these payments should be transferred or paid into your company’s account when you really had nothing to do with them?    When you talk about those payments improving the grading of your company, do you mean that your company would be seen as doing business that involves large transactions?     Yes, so are you saying that that is what Mr Majola said namely these amounts would be paid into your account so that your company’s grading could be improved or are you saying that that simply the benefit that you saw for your company were in regard to these payments.    If I recall correctly you said yesterday that your attitude was that the payment of these amounts into your company’s account was wrong, am I correct?     I think he means he could explain now if he can be given the context of how he came to give that answer yesterday.    I think I asked you yesterday whether you thought there was anything wrong with your company receiving these payments that Mr Majola had arranged with you would be paid into your company.  Do you remember me asking you that question?     Am I right to think that your answer was that you thought these payments were wrong, receiving these payments was wrong?    Yes, why did you think it was wrong?     Am I right to think that you thought that this was something that should not be happening, namely payment of these amounts into your account in circumstances where you had done any work?     Why didn’t you at any stage say to Mr Majola I think this is wrong, please don’t – let us not continue with this arrangement?    And then let’s talk about the payments from Premier Attraction.     Now I think you said that prior to you becoming aware of the first payment into your company’s account, the money from Premier Attraction you were not aware or nobody had spoken toyou to alert you that some payment would be made into your account?     But after you had become aware you said you did get a call from Mr Myeni is that correct?     I know it is – it is many years ago but I would like you if you can to cast your mind back to that conversation that you had with her and try and tell me exactly how that conversation went.     No, what I wanted is, if you are able to help me, is just the content of the discussion.  She called you, what did she say as muchas, tell me as much as you can remember?  I accept that you might not remember a lot about the conversation but tell me as much as you can as to how that conversation went? She called you, what did she say?     Okay, alright, but you have told us something that she told you in that conversation, is it not?     Yes, no, that is helpful.  So, she asked you whether you saw some activity into in your account right?       And what did you say in response?     Did she say that she was talking about the money thatcame from Premier Attraction, or did she not mention the name of the company?     And did you say yes, you saw?     How did you know which amount she was talking about?  Which money there that had come in which she was talking about?     In the, but in the end both of you were quite clear that you were talking about the same amount?    At the time when on the two occasions that you say she asked you to pay the money into an account which later turned out to be the account of the Jacob Zuma Foundation.  Was your company in a financial position where it could have donated the amounts that you transferred into the Jacob Zuma Foundation account?     Was your company financially in a position to make adonation as large as the donation, as the amounts that you, you paid over to the Jacob Zuma Foundation?     And its situation had not changed substantially when the second amount came in that you were asked to pay over to the Jacob Zuma Foundation?     Okay, alright.  Miss Hofmeyr, anything?     Mr X, we have come to the end of your evidence.  Later on I will weigh up your evidence together with the evidence of any other person who may come and give evidence on the matters on which you have given evidence.  At this stage I cannot say what the truth is because I must still hear other Witnesses.  But I do want to thank you for comingto the Commission to give evidence and assist the Commission even when you were, you felt that your safety and that of your family was under threat.  The Commission will do everything it can to make sure that you are provided with protection, obviously it can only go up to a certain point but it will do everything that it is able to do and I also just want to tell you that we need more South-Africans who will come and assist the Commission and give Evidence, even if there may be threats to their safety and their lives.  But we do appreciate that it is not always easy, but to those who do come despite those situations we are deeply indebted and we appreciate it and we just want you to know, you and your family toknow that the Commission is grateful that you were able to come and give evidence despite the situation that you have described.  If later on we need you to come back, we will ask you to come back and I hope you will be able to come.  You understand?     Thank you very much you are now excused.     Yes – yes sure.     Okay is that all you wanted to say?     Is there anything else that you might not have been asked which you feel you would like to say in regard to any of the matters that you have dealt with?     Okay thank you, you are excused.  Yes Miss Hofmeyr?     Yes, I thought we would finish at three.     No, but it is okay.  Tomorrow who is our Witness?    Yes, okay no that is fine.  Shall we start at normal time?     Okay, alright. Okay we will adjourn then for the day and tomorrow we will start at normal time, namely 10 o’clock.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair.    We are indeed.    Thank you Chair.    Can I just confirm that Mr X can hear us clearly?   Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Mr X if you could please have in front of you your affidavit bundle which is Exhibit DD31 and if you turn to page 7 in that affidavit?      Thank you.  Mr X we finished yesterday at the point at which you were going to tell us what you did with the funds after they were received from Klomac Engineering.  And you begin to describe that in your affidavit at paragraph 29.  What I would like to do first is understand from you how the payment of those funds workedgenerally and then we will go into the detail of each amount that was paid arising from the Klomac payment.  So if we start generally what was the general process that would be followed after you received the money insofar as you were engaging with Mr Majola?    Hm.   And then what would you do?    And is the him Mr Majola?    And then what would happen?    Thank you.  Chair is there…    If he was busy would you phone him again later?    Then would he come back to you when he was able to do so?   Thank you.  I would like to then move over to page 8 to look at what specifically happened to the R2 million…    Apologies Chair.   Thank you.  And – and actually just one furtherquestion to conclude the general procedure.  We have spoken about transfers to bank accounts but did Mr Majola ever ask for money to be given to him in cash?    When he did request cash how did that happen?    Thank you.  I would then like to go to the specific transactions related to the R2 394 000.00 that was receivedfrom Klomac Engineering on the 26 January.  And for this purpose if you can turn to page 8 of your affidavit in DD31 Mr X.      And paragraph 31.    So at paragraph 31.1 you – let me just read the    Sorry.    Sorry I might have said that incorrectly.    Apologies.  R 394 000.00 Chair thank you.“Save for the VAT portion was paid out in the following tranches as per Mr Majola’s instructions.  The first amount there is R150 000.00 was paid to Safeza Kohnke Engineering PTY Limited on the 2 February 2015.” Do you see that?    I do not suggest that we need to go every time to the bank statement Chair but all of the bank statements are attached.   For each of these transactions.    But I would like Mr X to clarify for us is, did you know what or who Safeza Kohnke Engineering was?    But can you confirm the amount of R150 000.00 was paid to Safeza Kohnke’s account on the 2 February 2015?    And – and can you confirm whether that was onMr Majola’s instruction?    Did – did Isibonelo ever do any work with or receive services from Safeza Kohnke Engineering?    And then if we go to the second payment that appears from your affidavit to have been paid the next day.  That was an amount of R850 000.00 which you say was paid on the 3 February 15. Was that again in accordance with Mr Majola’s instruction?    And then if we go to paragraph 31.3.  Mr X what you describe there in the affidavit is that on the 11 February so that is just more than a week later after the second tranche was paid.      You explain that there was a transfer of that R1million on the 11 February to a Money Market account of Isibonelo and then you later describe how that money came back into the Isibonelo account and was paid out.  Can you just describe for us how that would occur?    And then when would you bring it back into your business account?   Indeed.    Thank you for that.  And as you record at paragraph 31.3 and the bank statements reflect it appears that R1 002 000.00 was transferred back into Isibonelo’s business account on the 9 March 2015 and then R1 million was paid out to Safeza Kohnke again on the same date, do you confirm that?    Thank you Mr X.  I would then like to at thispoint draw your attention to an affidavit of Mr Paton from Klomac Engineering.  Chair I indicated yesterday that we had received a series of further affidavits from the other entities involved in this arrangement.  They have been collected in one file which we propose be entered into the record as Exhibit DD28.  That file comprises the affidavit of MrKhan to whom I made reference yesterday.  The affidavit of Mr Shanga and the affidavit of Mr Paton.  So if I could request that we enter that into the record and then ask Mr X to get that file in front of him.    It says only Mr Khan’s name on the spine, but it actually comprises Mr Khan, Mr Shange and Mr Paton’s affidavits.    Ah.  I see.    Where …   Oh sorry.  That is an error     Simply on the spine Chair.    We - we will correct that.    Indeed.    Yes.    Hm.    Indeed.   Chair, if I …    There is two of Mr Khan’s.  One of Mr Shange and one of Mr Paton and maybe what I can do is …    With reference to the starting page of each of them.    Assist with the different exhibit numbers.   So if I could propose that Mr Khan’s affidavit and his supplementary be entered into the exhibit as DD28A.    Is that suitable and then I indicate what pages it runs to.    It does.    Yes.   Certainly.    Indeed.    On 4 December 2019.    On 12 December 2019.    We are indebted Chair and then if we can then also proceed to Mr Shange’s affidavit.    That commences at paginated page 1-2-7 …    And I propose that be entered into the record as EXHIBIT DD28C and that is the affidavit deposed to by Mr Shange on 16 January 2020 and its annexures.    And then finally in this file if we turn to page 1-50 - 1-5-0.That is the first page of affidavit ofMr Colin Gordon Paton.  That was deposed to on 11 November 2019 and I propose that it and its annexures be entered into the record as EXHIBIT DD28D.    Mr X, what I would like to draw your attention to in the affidavit of Mr Paton is the following.  Mr Paton explains at page 1-5-0 of EXHIBIT DD28D at paragraph 1 that he is the Managing Director of Klomac Engineering.  Do you see that?    It is page 150 paragraph 1.    Have you ever met …?    Apologies.   Oh.  Apologies.  I thought you had been given the …    The full set.    Of course.  Sorry.  I think it was there yesterday.  We might have …    Tidied it away.  If we can beg leave just to approach the interpreter …   For that purpose.    Thank you Chair.      Apologies Ms Khumalo.    You will need page 1-5-0.  I think it is after the last divider.   Have you ever met Mr Paton?    Have you ever met anyone associated with Klomac Engineering?    And then I would like to draw your attention to page 1-6-0 - 160 of Mr Paton’s affidavit - EXHIBIT DD28D.    On that page 160 Mr X what Mr Paton does at paragraph 39 is he summarises what his understanding was of Isibonelo’s role.  Just to clarify Ms Khumalo.  It - it is paragraph 39 on page 160.     Yes.  Do you see that?    I would like to read into the record what Mr Paton says there, because what he has done up until this point in his affidavit Chair and Mr X is.  He has explained the various transactions in which Klomac was involved and what Mr Paton indicates    And what I would like to ask Mr X is whether it is correct that Isibonelo was appointed as a subcontractor to Mhlathuze at any point after 2015?   Yes.    And did you ever do any work as a subcontractor to Mhlathuze from 2015?    Thank you.  Chair, just to make a note.  The whole manner in which Bills of Quantities and - ooh, I see we have exceeded our time.    Oh.     Oh we - we started early.  I am - I am sort of anhour out.  So we do …    We can actually progress a bit.    I just wanted to put a note in here.  The - the first part of the paragraph that we read into the record there of Mr Paton is about how on the side of the contractors to Mhlathuze the Bills of Quantities would be adjusted for these payments, but I - I am just indicating.  I am not traversing that with Mr X, because Mr X’s involvement does not …   See that side …    Of the arrangement.    If you will just explain that.    Thank you.  I would then like to return to your affidavit Mr X and that is in EXHIBIT DD31 at page 9.    Now what I am going to do Mr X is take you through a series of further invoices that were generated by Isibonelo and as I understand your affidavit you received instructions then to - to pay out the monies received and I am going to take you to each one and ask you to confirm that that is what happened and where necessaryI will ask you a few further questions about a particular invoice or a particular payment.    Okay.  So let us start at paragraph 33 on page 9.    Now at paragraph 33 you start to describe an invoice that Isibonelo issued to Afrostructures and I would like to take you to that invoice.  You will find it at page 46 - 4-6.    What is the date of that invoice?    Thank you and is that an invoice of which you are aware?    And the customer there is indicated as Afrostructures.  Is that correct?    Have you ever had any dealings, telephonic, in person or otherwise with anyone from Afrostructures?    There is a description of works on this invoice.     Where did you get that description of works from?    Did Isibonelo ever renovate offices or convert garages to offices for Afrostructures?    And can we take it that your previous evidenceabout how these invoices would be generated and then taken away by Mr Majola applies to this invoice?    And then you received funds related to this invoice.  You say that at page 10 on paragraph 35 on 17 April 2015.  Iwould like to take you to that bank statement and you will find that at page 48 - 4-8.    And you will see highlighted towards the bottom of that page …    Is an amount of R872 234,74 received - it appears - on 17 April from Afrostructures.  Can you confirm that?    I would then like to deal with another set ofinvoices, because they happen at the same time and then we will speak about what you did with the monies after they were received into Isibonelo’s bank account.    So if we are now at page 10 of your affidavit - EXHIBIT DD31.    Paragraph 36.    That refers to a - a second invoice that the -that Isibonelo issued to Klomac and you will find it at page 50 - 5-0.    5-0, yes.  Do you have that?    What is the date of this invoice? And it is again addressed to Klomac Engineering for the attention of Mark Freeman.  Your evidence previously was that you have had no dealings with Klomac Engineering and that you do not know who Mr Mark Freeman is.  Does that apply to this invoice?    And the description of works there is   And can we take it that your previous evidence applies here insofar as the description of work having been supplied by Mr Majola?    And the total of that invoice including VAT was R866 680,67.  Is that correct?    And then just to take you to the bank statementwhere the funds pursuant to that invoice were received.  You will find that at page 52 - 5-2 - of EXHIBIT DD31.    And you will see the highlighted entry on that page indicates that on 20 April 2015 there was a payment received fromKlomac Engineering in the amount of R866 680,67.  Is that correct?    And you confirm that Isibonelo received those funds?    I would not like to turn to what was done after those two amounts were received from Afrostructures and Klomac andfor that purpose if we could go back to your affidavit at page 11, Mr X.    So at paragraph 39 at the top of page 11 you    Oh apologies.   And the first payment you reflect there was on 21 April 2015 and that was R600 000,00 paid to Sifezakonke.  Do you confirm that?   And can I ask whether the method of the process preceding this payment was the same as the one that you described generally earlier?    So Mr Majola at some point after you alerted him to the fact that the funds had been received told you where to pay out those funds.  Is that correct?    Now on 21 April 2015 R600 000,00 was paid toSifezakonke and you have already given evidence that you had previously amounts to Sifezakonke.  Is that correct?    At paragraph 39.2 you indicate that the day later on 22 April 2015 an amount of R700 000 was paid to Isivunosami Trading.  Is that correct?    Now is Isivunosami Trading is a - is a new entity.  How did you get the details of its account?    Did you have any dealings telephonic or in person with any person from Isivunosami Trading when this payment was made or before or after it?    And do you know what …    And did Isivuno Sami Trading ever provide any services or work to Isibonelo?     And then at paragraph 40 Mr X you begin for the first time to deal with the cash withdrawals which I understand from your affidavit were also done on the instruction of Mr Majola, I would like to take you to those now.    What you recount at paragraph 40 is that there was an amount withdrawn from Isibonelo’s account on the 17 t h of April 15 for R30 000 and there was an amount withdrawn on the 21 s t of April 2015 for R100 000.   Please can you tell us how it came that you withdrew those amounts?     What are the circumstances around the withdrawal of those amounts?     And how ...[intervenes]      And then if we go over to page 12 of your affidavit Mr X.       We are going to deal with the next invoice that Isibonelo generated to Afrostructures, I would like to take you to that invoice, you will find it at page 62, six two.     What is the date of that invoice     And I see that it is made out to Afrostructures and the description of the works is alteration to offices.     Is the previous evidence you gave applicable to this invoice, insofar as you do not know Afrostructures, you have not had dealings with them and Isibonelo did not do work altering any offices for Afrostructures?     And then at paragraph 43 you record that Isibonelo received the funds from Afrostructures, that’s back in your affidavit at page 12.     I would like to go then to paragraph 44because you describe there what instructions you received from Mr Majola after receiving that payment.     What did you do with the monies that were received on 24 July 2015 Mr X?     I can take you to it Mr X.   Let’s go to page 6.     There are two lines there highlighted in yellow,the first reflects a credit into the account, so money coming into the Isibonelo account and it indicates that it was from Afrostructures in the amount of R917 940.54.   Do you confirm that that money was received?     And three lines down on that page there is anindication of a cash withdrawal, it appears to be from Richards Bay 371 and it is in the amount of R60 000, do you recall the circumstances around that withdrawal?     What happened?    And that appears to have been withdrawn on the following day, on the 25 t h of July, is that correct?     And then if you go over to the statement for two days later you will find that at page 66.     There is a highlighted portion there reflecting a payment into Sifezakonke Engineering of R600 000 on the 27 t h of July 15, do you see that?    What were the circumstances around that payment?     That’s the instruction of Mr Majola?     Mr X then I have to take you to page 68, because 68 is a continuation of your bank statement for the ate of 27 July 2015, do you have that in front of you?     Now towards the bottom of that page there is a     And that appears to have taken place on the27 t h of July 2015, do you see that?     Can you tell us how this SMS to M Majola arose?     But do you have any knowledge of why there would be an SMS to M Majola after the R600 000 was paid to Sifezakonke?     Do you know any people with the initial M and the surname Majola other than the Mr Majola that you have been referring to in your testimony?     Thank you.  We can then go over back in your affidavit to page 13.     I think so Chair, we are quite close.     Indeed.     Thank you Chair.  Mr X can you hear us?     Mr X I am going to continue just going throughsystematically the different invoices and payments and for that purpose I would like you to be at page 13 of your affidavit, EXHIBIT DD31.       Thank you, and you describe there at paragraph 46 another invoice that Isibonelo issued again to Klomac.   I would like to take you to that invoice, you will find it at page 70, seven zero.     What is the date of this invoice?     Mr X I think the version you’re looking at just because of how it is recorded in your affidavit, I think that is a 06, do you confirm it’s 24.06.2015.     Thank you.   And again can I just get yourconfirmation that the generation of this invoice followed the process that you described to us previous.     And let’s just for the record record it is an invoice prepared on Isibonelo Construction letterhead, it is addressed to Klomac Engineering and the description of works is perimeter fencing for an amount of R400 000, and servicing of air conditioners for R401 382.     Sorry, I misread, that is R401 328, thank youChair.     And again ...[intervenes]      And just to clarify again did Isibonelo ever do perimeter fencing work or servicing of air-conditioners for Klomac Engineering?    And did you receive the description of works for this invoice as you have described previously from Mr Majola?     I would then like to return to your affidavit atpage 13, paragraph 48.     At paragraph 48 you tell us what happened with the funds received from Klomac after that invoice was issued and I would like to just take you to those bank statements so you can confirm for us what happened with the funds.   The first of those you will find at page 74.   Page 74.     You will see highlighted there is an entry on the bank statement that on the 14 t h of August an amount of R149 000appears to have been paid to Isivuno Sami, do you see that?     Is your evidence given previously applicable here, insofar as the instruction to make that payment to Isivuno Sami came from Mr Majola?     And then if you go over to page 76, there are two transactions that happened three days later on the 17 t h of August 15?     So the first one highlighted there appears to have been a cash withdrawal, again at Richards Bay, of R50 000, why was that money withdrawn?     From whom?    Mr X can you help us there once these withdrawals were made how would the cash be given to Mr Majola?     Would he come to you to collect it?     Thank you Chair.  Sorry so we were at the point at which you indicated that Mr Majola would come to you to collect the cash, is that correct?     And you indicated there would be times when you withdrew the cash, were there times when other people withdrewthe cash?     And when your daughter would withdraw the money how would the cash be handed over?     And what arrangement would then be made?     And would it always be the case that he came to you to collect the money?     And did you ever ask what the cash was for?     So most – are you saying most of the time Mr Majola got the money from you and it was only a few times that he got it from your daughter.    Thank you, and then I would like to take you to the next bank statement that indicates what happened with the money.  Oh, sorry it’s on the same page, we were at page 76, are you there?     You will see the second highlighted entry on that page indicates that on the 17 t h of August 2015 an amount of R550 000 was transferred to Isivuno Sami.  Can you confirm that that is what happened?    Thank you, and you can confirm that that is what indeed happened, that an amount of R550 000 was paid to Isivuno Sami.     And does your previous evidence about the process apply that that was done on the instruction of Mr Majola?     Thank you Mr X.  We then go to a new entity to whom Isibonelo issued an invoice in September of 2015.  It is on the29 t h September 2015 but you will find the invoice at page 78, seventy eight.     What just for the record is the date of this invoice?    I think from your affidavit it indicates it is probably 29.     Thank you, and again this appears to be an invoice issued by Isibonelo to Mndima Civils, is that correct?     Did Isibonelo have any dealings telephonic or in person with anyone from Mndima Civils when this invoice wasgenerated?     Have you ever had any interactions with persons from Mndima Civils either before or after the generation of this invoice?     Let us look at what the description of work says on this page.   It reflects there building block stores, renovation of carpenters workshop and paint roof leak and be price that appears for that work is R816 000,90, do you see that?    Did Isibonelo ever perform the work for Mndima Civils described in this invoice?     How did you get the details of Mndima Civils ifyou had never interacted with them?     Thank you.  I then want to go to the next invoice which now is sent to I think it’s the 4 t h entity we have dealt with in these proceedings.   You will find that at page 82, 82.     What is the date of this invoice.     It appears to be the day after the date of Mndima Civils invoice we were just looking at which was 29/09/2015,correct?     Now this is an Isibonelo Construction invoice made out to customer and the name is SSOJV, what does that mean?     So you don’t even know the entity to whom this was made out?     And the description of works is office renovations for which the price charged was R1.5million and surgetower refurbishment for R500 000, did Isibonelo perform any of those works?     And can you perform Isibonelo did not perform those works?    Thank you.  And then I would like to move to what happened after receipt of the funds, both for the Mndima Civils invoice of 29 September and the invoice to SSO which we will understand in other evidence is a reference to Steffinuti ...[indistinct]      Apologies.     Thank you Chair.  I would then like to look at what happened when those funds were received, but first let’s go and look at the bank statements which shows the payment R2 280 000, you will find that at page 84, eight four.     Thank you, and you will see highlighted on that page there is an entry that on the 2 n d of December 2015 an amount of R2 280 000 appears to have been paid into the account, and the reference there is Steffinuti Stocks/OROJV.     I confirm.     At the time of the issue of the invoice and the receipt of this payment did Isibonelo have any interactions or dealings with Steffinuti stocks?     Have you ever had any dealings before or afterwith any person from Steffinuti stocks?     I would then like to track through the bank statements what happens with the money after that amount is received and I will draw your attention to page 86.     So you will see there the bank statement is continuing on the date of the 2 n d of December 2015, that is the day on which  the payment into the account of R2 280 000 was made.     The first highlighted entry on the page 86 of EXHIBIT DD31 is a cash withdrawal, again at Richards Bay of R30 000.  Why was that cash withdrawn?     And was it given to Mr Majola?    And was it given to him in the way that you described previously, that you would phone him, tell him that you had the cash and he would come and collect it?     And then the second highlighted entry on that page is a transfer of R400 000 on the same date, the 2 n d of December, to what appears to be Sifezakonke Engineer, is that correct?     Do you confirm that that was again in the lightof your previous evidence on the instructions of Mr Majola?     Then if we go over to page 88 you will see the bank statement for the next day, the 3 r d of December 2015.     There is a first highlighted entry there of a cash withdrawal at Richards Bay of R150 000, why was that cash withdrawn?     Was the money given to him?    There is also an entry there of R15 000 of a cash, a cheque cashed, is that related to the dealings of Mr Majola?     Right, then let’s go over to page 90, nine zero.  We are now at the bank statement for the next day, that’s the 4 t h of December 2015.     There appear to be two payments that were made on this day, in highlighting to Isivuno Sami, there was first an amount of R150 000, and then later a further R100.   Can you confirm why those amounts were paid to Isivuno Sami on the 4 t h of December 15?    Thank you, if we go over to page 92 we move to the 5 t h of December.     There is a highlighted cash withdrawal of R25 000 at Vryheid, why was that amount withdrawn on that day?     Thank you.  Let us go over to page 94.     We will do that Chair.  I think that the evidence today has assisted to clarify that.     So just for the records purposes what we will do is, we will retain in yellow highlighting all of those amounts that Mr X has confirmed were done on the instructions of Mr Majola     And where he is confirming his evidence today that they relate to his own monies we will make a green highlighting.     Let us then move if we may to page 94, nine four.     This is a bank statement reflecting transactions on the 7 December 2015.     And the 7 December was five days after you had received the large payment of R2 280 000.00 from Stefanutti Stocks, is that correct?     And you will see highlighted there in yellow is a payment to Sifezakonke of R900 000.00.  What was the circumstances of that payment?    And then the last one in the sequence is at page 96.     And now we are on the 8 December, so we are six days after receipt of the payment from Stefanutti Stocks and it indicates that a million Rand was paid to Isivuno Sami on that day.  What were the circumstances of that payment?     Mr X what your affidavit then goes on to explain is in that period between the 2 n d December and the 8 t h December 2015 that we have been looking at,  Isibonelo issued a further invoice to a customer identified as SSOJV.  I would like to take you to that invoice, itis at page 98 of Exhibit DD(51).  And can I take it then, well, let us first of all do the date of this invoice, what is the date of the invoice?     Indeed.  It is 0-5, I think based on your affidavit.  It was made out to customer SSOJV, when it was made out [intervenes].      Apologies Chair.     Yes, it is 05/12/2015 Chair.     Thank you, oh yes, yes, apologies, and that is confirmed at paragraph 57 of Mr X’s affidavit at page 16.  Right, let us look at the customer as to whom this was made out.  It was made out to SSOJV.  Mr X at the time this invoice was generated did you know who SSOJV was?    And the description of the works, again, some more parameter fencing it appears in the amount of R895 400.00 and pump-station construction built for an amount of R853 107.20, do you confirm that is what is reflected on the invoice?     Did Isibonelo ever do parameter fencing work or pump-station construction for SSOJV or any other entity?     And can you confirm the total amount invoiced onthis invoice was R1 993 435.01?     And then if we go the bank statement that reflects the receipt of this payment you will find that at page 100/     Can you please indicate from whom this payment of R1 993 435, they seem to have left off the one Cent, was received from?     Thank you, I think the full entry reads StefanuttiStocks / OROJV, is that correct?     I would then like to look at what happened to the funds after they were received in the Isibonelo Business Account with Standard Bank, and for that purpose please turn to page 102.    There is a highlighted entry there in yellow indicating a payment from Isibonelo to Isivuno Sami in the amount of R850 000.00 on the 24 February 2016, do you see that?     And what were the circumstances of that payment?     And if we go over the page to page 104.    And there is a highlighted entry there in yellow indicating a payment from Isibonelo to Sifezakonke ‘Construc’, which I think is short for construction of R700 000.00 on the 24 February 2016.  Do you confirm that that payment was made by Isibonelo to Sifezakonke Construction?     And what was the circumstances around that payment?     And then if we go to page 106.     You will see highlighted there a cash withdrawal the following day on the 25 February 2016 at Richards Bay of R150 000.00.  Why was that cash withdrawn?    And can you confirm that once the cash was withdrawn what happened to it?     And was the money given to Mr Majola?     Chair we have come to the end of the series of payments, both receipts and payments out, but I did neglect to get Mr X’sconfirmation of the receipt of the Mdima Civils payment, and that you will find at page 80, eight zero Mr X.     Now that was a payment indicated on the statement to have been made on the 1 st December 2015  The amount was R930 241.02 and it appears to indicate to have been received from Mdima Civils, is that the same amount that you invoiced Mdima Civils for, a month, on the 29 September 2015?  Let me go to the invoice so you can compare it.  The invoice is at page 78, seven eight, and then the bank statement is at page 80.    Thank you and your evidence in relation to that invoice, I take it would be the same, you were told to invoice Mdima Civils despite not having any relationship with them.  The Description of Works came from Mr Majola, the invoice was generated and then paymentwas received.  Is that correct?     Thank you, I would now like to move Mr X to the last topic of relevance in your affidavit and you will find that at page 17 of the affidavit, which is Exhibit DD(31).     Now what you say at the bottom of that page in paragraph 60 is that you going to deal with three payments that Isibonelo received from Premier Attraction 1016 CC.     Big picture, certainly.       Yes, we can certainly do that I will ask my Juniorand team of Investigators who are assisting us today, to get to that.     Full picture, indeed.  They can work on that and then we will deal with it at the end of the evidence with Mr X.  Thank you.    We now move to what you describe in your affidavit at the bottom of page 17 as Conduit Payments, and you say that you are going to deal with three payments that you received from Premier Attraction.  Mr X I would like to take you first of all to the bank statements that show these payments into Isibonelo’s account and to do that we need to turn first to page 108.     108.     Do you see at the bottom there a highlighted entry there in yellow, reflecting a payment into Isibonelo’s account on the 24 t h of October 2015 in the amount of One Million Rand?     Now the description for the transaction appears on the left-hand side of the page, do you see that?     And it reads as follows    When you received this payment into Isinebelo’s account Mr X, did you know what PA1016 was?     I am going to come in a moment to what you did learn about that payment but I want to do all three payments first in thebank accounts.  So can we next go to the bank account appearing at 1-1-0?     1-1-0, one hundred and ten.     You will see highlighted there on the statement reflecting a transfer into Isibonelo’s account on 11th of December 2015, is an amount of R1 150 000.00 do you see that?     And again, the IB payment description indicatesthat it is from PA1016, do you see that?     On the 11 t h of December 2015, did you know what PA1016 was referring to?     Apologies, I might have said, when I, December of 2015.       2015.       Apologies, I might have made an error because the statement indicates it is from December 2015 to January 2016, but this is the date of 11 t h December 2015 and the question was, when this payment was received in Isibonelo’s account, did Mr X know what the reference PA1016 referred to?    And the final bank statement reflecting these three payments appears at page one hundred and twelve, 112.       There is a first highlighted entry on that page reflecting a payment into the Isibonelo account with Standard Bank on the 2 n d of February 2016 with a payment reference again from PA1016.  Do you see that?     On the 2 n d of February 2016 did you know whatthe reference PA1016 referred to?     Mr X, I would then like to return to your affidavit at page 18.  That is in Exhibit DD(31).       Now you have testified that when these amounts were received in Isibonelo’s bank account, you did not know what the reference PA1016 referred to.  Is that correct?     And if you look at paragraph 61 on page 18 ofyour affidavit.     You say there    And what happened?  What did the commission’s investigators then do?       Thank you, and you indicate at paragraph 62 that you were shown a spreadsheet.  [Intervenes]     Apologies, Chair.       Thank you.  And you indicate at paragraph 62that you were shown a spreadsheet relating to the three payments that had been received from Standard Bank.  I would like to take you to that spreadsheet.  It is at page 114.       114 Indeed.       Is this the document that the investigator showed you?       You will see over on the, well, let us deal with    Yes, certainly.  And just for assistance, Mr X, if you go back to one of the bank statements of Isibonelo, and you can just flip back two pages to page 112.  You will see at the top of that pagethere is an account number indicated and let me read it into the record.       It is    Thank you.  And then if we go back to page 114.       You will see that below those descriptions that we have just read into the record, there are three lines dealing with thethree payments that we have been looking at already in your evidence received from PA1016 and if you go right across to the other side of the page, you will see a column there that is headed Contra Account Names.  Do you see that?       And what is indicated there as the Contra account name for these payments?       On the far-right hand side.       Oh apologies.      Oh, I am sorry.  Yes, I am sure- I have highlighted them so maybe I can read them into the record.    And ask whether it ... (intervenes)    Confirms what you had told.  So, what they read Mr X is for each of the three payments received, the ones that we have been looking at previously which bore the reference PA1016.  The spreadsheet from the bank indicates that that payment was received from a Standard Bank account of Premier Attraction 1016 ta (which means trading as) co.  That is all that is entered there.  Does it accord with your understanding that this page confirm that the payment was made by Premier Attraction 1016?   At the time that the Commission showed you this information about who had paid these amounts into your account, did you know anything else about Premier Attraction, who its owner was or who worked in the business?    Did the Commission then tell you who they have established was the owner of Premier Attraction 1016?    And who did they indicate that was?    Do you know Thalente Myeni?    How do you know him?    And in December 2015 and early 2016, did you have any business dealings with him?    To early 2016.    Around that period did you have any business dealings with an entity called Premier Attraction 1016?    Mr X, I would like to return to your affidavit at paragraph 18 because on that page you describe a prior dealing you had with Ms Duduzile Myeni.    Page 18.  Mr X, at the bottom of that page you talk about some work that you and MS Myeni did around 1997/1998.  Can you please tell us what that was?    Just so that I have it right it was ... (intervenes)    Can we be clear this was small business grooming, not young lion grooming.  Is that correct?    Thank you.  And Mr X, you describe over the page on page 19 the extend to which you and Ms Myeni worked together at that time.  Can you describe that?    Did she come to learn of the details of Isibonelo’s bank account in those interactions?    Why was that?    Thank you.  And you go on at paragraph 65 to deal with the time when Isibonelo received these payments from Premier.  You have testified about this previously but I would just like to get this clear.  At that time did Isibonelo have any business relationship with either Premier the entity or Mr Myeni himself?    No, at the time that the payments werereceived from Premier.    And you are absolutely certain about that?    Yes.    And in this Commission it could be the Premier so.   At paragraph 66 Mr X you start to tell us in your affidavit what happened after you received these payments into the account.  Please can you take us through that?  Oh apologies.   He might not have because the evidence was ... (intervenes)    Yes.    The evidence that I think you only testified toMr X was that Mr Thalente Myeni grew up in front of you but let us confirm what is your understanding of the relationship between Ms Duduzile Myeni and Mr Thalente Myeni?    Thank you.  And then I was going to move at page 19 of your affidavit to the explanation you give of what happened after you received these three payments.  Please can you take us through that?      Yes certainly.    So, the first amount was received in October of 15 and you will find that at page 108.   Now this is the first amount of 1 million rand that was received on the 24 t h of October 2015 into the Isibonelo account.  What happened after you received that first 1 million?    Yes of course.    Yes.    Because they are three different statements.    At least they are three different payments.  Let me be clear.    Let us go back to page 20 of the affidavit.      Thank you.  And you will see at the beginning of that page at paragraph 68 you indicate there in your affidavit; In respect of the first payment of 1 million which was received byIsibonelo on 24 October 2015 the following transpired.And then in 68.1 you record in your affidavit; 68.1 Ms Myeni requested that I withdraw these funds and deliver them to her in cash.Do you see that?   How did she make that request?    And what did you do pursuant to her request?    Yes, we will come to that in a moment.  What I would just like to understand first broadly is the process, right, because I understand that your evidence thus far is, you received the 1 million, you then were contacted by Ms Myeni and she indicated she wanted you to give her cash from that amount.  Is that correct?    Okay we will go to each of the withdrawals in a moment.  But generally, how would you get the cash to Ms Myeni?    And which house was that?    And you indicated in your evidence a moment ago that you would deliver the money to the houses.  Is that correct?    Yes.    How would you ... (intervenes)    How would you drop-off the cash at the houses?    I just want to break that down a bit.  How didyou get access to the houses?    And then your evidence was that you would go into the office and you would hide the money.  Is that correct?    Why did you do that?    And then you indicated you would contact her. Is that correct?    Thank you.  And I also understood your evidence earlier Mr X to be that you might have recalled one occasion where you actually gave her the money herself?  Is that correct?    Did that only happen once?    And can we take it that for the rest you would follow this process where you would gain access to the office and then hide it and then contact her later?    Thank you.  I would then like to take you Mr X to the specific transactions that occurred after you received the first 1 million on the 24 t h of October 2015.  And for that purpose, the first transaction that you identify in your affidavit you will find in the bank statement appearing at page 121.    So just to remember what the timing is.  On the- we have looked at the bank statement on the 24 t h of October 2015 you received the first payment of a million rand from Premier Attraction 16.  Do you recall that?    24 October.    And then at page 121 there is an entry highlighted three days later on the 27 t h of October 2015 and that is a cash withdrawal of 50 000.  Do you see that?    Why was that money withdrawn?    And did you give that cash to her?   And can I confirm it was in one of the two methods that you have described either handing it to her herself or hiding it at the office of the house she occupied at the time?    Thank you.  And then if you go to the next bank statement it is at page 123.    Mr X if we then go to page 123.    You will see the next day, it is the first highlighted entry on that bank statement.  The next day is the 28 October 2015 there is a cash withdrawal from Richards Bay of R31 500.00, do you see that?    Why was that money withdrawn?    That is Ms Dudu Myeni?    Can I just ask Mr X at this point did Ms Myeni give you any explanation for why she wanted these amounts in cash withdrawn?    And I know it is a number of years back Mr X but do you recall how soon after you were told the first R1 million had been paid into the account that you were contacted by Ms Myeni?    I am asking whether Mr X remembers how soon after he was told the first R1 million had been paid into his account he was then phoned by Ms Myeni?    And remaining calm I think was the previous [indistinct] so I am glad we – we understand what was happening on the ground.  Okay thank you Mr X.  Okay so what – and certainly that timeframe at least accords with what we see happening in the bank accounts.  Because it comes in on the 24 October and then the first withdrawal you have told us about is the 27 October.  The second withdrawal we were dealing with at page 123 was on the 28 October.  But also on page 123 Mr X there is a transfer highlighted further downon the page of R600 000.00 to an account that you identify in your affidavit and you have spoken about previously which was the Money Market account.  Can you explain why that R600 000.00 was transferred to your Money Market account?    And that was done it appears from thestatement at page 123 on the 28 October 2015.  But there was then a withdrawal the following day on the 29 October 2015 and I would like to go to that.  You will find it at page 127.      So what it records there is a withdrawal from the business account again the following day of R200 000.00 at Richards Bay.  Why was that money withdrawn?    And was the money given to her in one of thetwo ways you described earlier?    Thank you.  Then we move a few further days forward in time and that is reflected the bank statement at page 129.    So this statement reflects that on the 3 November 2015 an amount of R27 000.00 was withdrawn at Richards Bay, do you see that?    And why was that amount withdrawn?    And was it given to Ms Myeni?    Thank you.  Chair there are a few more of these transactions relating to the first R1 million.  I see that we areclose to the lunch break.  So maybe we could just talk for a moment about arrangements if that suits?    I am very close.  I need to complete these two – this – these transactions related to the first R1 million.    And then I need to deal simply with the later two receipts of amounts and what happened with them.  So I do not imagine taking more than about twenty minutes maximum.    There is an application that is also going to be brought.  We had notice of yesterday.    From the lawyers representing Mr Majola.    And I – I have seen that they have come back to the hearing room while we have been …    Having Mr X’s evidence.  We would certainly like an opportunity to use the lunch break to receive the application.    Look at it.    And then possibly we can deal with it after we complete Mr X’s evidence.   I think maybe quarter past two would be adequate.    Just so that we can…    Properly consider the application.    And then the proposal would be to complete MrX’s evidence and then deal with the application.    Thank you Chair.    Certainly Chair.    We do not oppose it, Chair.    Thank you Chair.  If it is convenient we canproceed with Mr X’s evidence.    Mr X, can you hear us?    Thank you.  Mr X, before we broke for the lunch adjournment we were at page 22 of your affidavit …    And we had dealt with the cash withdrawal of R27 000,00 which occurred on 3 November 2015 and that is referred to in paragraph 68.11 on page 22 …   And then we - I would like us to move to paragraph 68.12 and I am going to take you to the relevant bank statement.    Now in that paragraph you describe how some of the money that you previously tested you had moved to the Money Market account then comes back into the business account and I would like to just take you to that relevant bank statement …    And then you bought back - as I understand your evidence at paragraph 68.12 - you bought an amount of R280 000,00 back from the Money Market into the current account.  Is that correct?    And then there was a withdrawal a few days later in October 2015.  I would like to take you to the statement that reflects it.  That is at page 1-2-7.    Unfortunately, I made an error there.  Can we go to page 1-3-1 please?    Okay.  So this is the bank statement that reflects as I understand your affidavit the money that comes back from your Money Market account into the business account and you will seeon that page highlighted in yellow that on 6 November an amount of R280 000,00 was transferred from and then there is a long account number there. That was the previous account number we were looking at when there were transactions with the business account - with theMoney Market account.  Is that correct?  And just to confirm.That was on 6 November 2015.  Is that correct?    And then if you go over to page 1-3-3.  That is the following statement for the same period and what the statement reflects is that the on the same day - 6 November 2015 - there was a cash withdrawal at Richards Bay of R200 000,00.  Do you see that?    Why was that …?    Why was that amount withdrawn?    And that is reference to Ms Duduzile Myeni.  Is that correct?    Thank you and then there are further transactions that occur on 23 November 2015.  Mr X, I am now referringto page 23 of your affidavit …    And what you detail in that paragraph is again money moving back from the Money Market and then funds being withdrawn.  I would like to take you to the relevant bank statements.You will find the statement at page 1-3-5 of EXHIBIT DD31.    1-3-5.    Thank you and then you see there are two lines highlighted there of the transactions in yellow.  The first one is a transfer into the business account from that account that we have previously identified as the Money Market.  What was the amount that was transferred on 23 November into the account?  Thank you.    Yes.  The - the 10 000 is reflected against a    Why was the R10 000,00 withdrawn?    Do I understand you to not be certain aboutwhether this R10 000,00 was withdrawn for your own purposes or to give to Ms Myeni?    Thank you and then if we go over to page 1-3-7.  You will see there that there are two transactions reflected on25 November two days later than the transaction we were just looking at and what appears to happen on this page is again a transfer from the account we have identified as the Money Market account. So an amount comes into your business account of R100 000,00 and immediately thereafter there is a cash withdrawal of R100 000,00.    And what was the reason for the withdrawal of the R100 000,00 cash on 25 November 2015?    Are you certain about that cash withdrawal having been a withdrawal that was requested by Ms Myeni?    And what makes you sure?    I - I understood your testimony previously to be that you would sometimes have a need for smaller cash amounts in your business.  I think you said up to around R10 000,00, but amounts greater than that would be amounts that were either requested by Mr Majola or Ms Myeni in this case.  Is that correct, Mr X?   Mr X, I would then like to move to the second two payments that Isibonelo received from Premier Attraction and for that purpose we go to page 24 of your affidavit.    Attraction.    Yes.  Now Mr X just to orientate ourselves in the chronology.  You will recall that the first payment from Premier Attraction was received in October 2015 and what we have just dealt with in your evidence is the series of withdrawals in cash that you made after receiving that amount and which you have indicated were then handed over to Ms Myeni either herself or at the office of her home.    So now I would like to move to the secondpayment that Isibonelo received from Premier Attraction and that was a payment we looked at the bank statement previously that was received in Isibonelo’s bank account on 11 December 2015.  Do you remember that?    15.    And as you record at page 24 it was in an amount of R1 150 000,00.  Is that correct?    Now please tell us what happened after you received this amount in the Isibonelo account?    And what did she say in that conversation?    And how did she provide those details?    And what did you do after you received those details?    Let us look at the bank statement that reflects that deposit.  You will find that at page 1-3-9.    Mr X, you will see highlighted there in yellow again is a transfer out of the Isibonelo account of R1 million on 11 December 2015 and that was the same day that you received the payment we looked at previously of R1 150 000,00.  Is that correct?    Now the description on this payment on the    Mr X, on the day that this payment was made into the Jacob Zuma Foundation account that was 11 December 2015. Did you know who those monies were being paid to?    When did you first learn that the million Rand that was paid on 11 December 2015 was in fact paid to the Jacob Zuma Foundation?    Thank you Mr X.  The - I would like to deal with the treatment of the second - well the final of the three payments that were received from Premier Attraction and you deal with that at page 24    The page is 143.     143.     Mr X you will be happy to hear that we are on the last page of the last annexure of your affidavit so the end is close.     Mr X on this page you will recall we looked at the bank statement previously when the million rand comes into the account, that bank statement reflected that it came into the account onthe 2 n d of February, and it appears from this statement that on the 4 t h of February, that’s two days later, an amount of R800 000 was paid out and the description this time is IB payment to JGZF, do you see that?     Can you tell us again how it came about that after receiving the R1million on the 2 n d of February from Premier Attraction this amount of R800 000 was paid out to the Jacob Zuma Foundation?     And did it happen in the same way as theprevious one where she called you telephonically?     And again how did she relay the details to you, did she give you just the account number or did she identify who the amount would be paid to?    And at the time did you have any knowledge that this payment of R800 000 was going to be made to the Jacob Zuma Foundation?     Mr X at the time that the R1million was paid in December of 2015 to the Jacob Zuma Foundation and the R800 000 was paid in February 2016 to the Jacob Zuma Foundation did you have any intention to donate R1.8million to the Jacob Zuma Foundation?    Thank you.     Mr X I would now like to deal with the evidence that this Commission heard yesterday Mr Talenthe Myeni and I would like to have your response to some of that evidence.   I will ask you aseries of questions about it.         It is three transactions.    Chair let me – indeed, can I just interpose there because you made a previous request that we also do a tracking of the total amounts received pursuant to the arrangement of Mr Majola.  What I wanted to propose in that regard is there are a number of transactions that we need to calculate, and also there have been one or two respects in which Mr Majola has clarified in his evidence today that amounts that he in his affidavit might have indicated that he thought were withdrawals for Mr Majola or Ms Myeni he now recallsmight have been withdrawals for himself.     So what we wanted to propose in this regard it is an important piece of the puzzle and we would like to take a bit of time after today to put together a fully comprehensive supplementary affidavit that Mr X deposes to, so that he can have an opportunity to do the full tally, do the full account so that there is one record of it, of what was paid on instruction and what was otherwise utilised and what proportion was VAT as well because we would need to tally it against that.    An d my proposal is we do that both for the payments received pursuant to the arrangement of Mr Majola according to Mr X’s evidence as well as the Premier Attraction payments.\     Thank you.  So we will do that and that supplementary affidavit will be made available to the Commission.   Mr X I would now like to just deal with what Mr Talenthe Myeni said in his evidence before the Commission yesterday.  Mr Myeni’s evidence before the Commission is that these three payments that Isibonelo received from Premier Attraction related to work that Isibonelo had done for Premier Attraction around the time that the payments were received.   Now what do you say in response to that?     And do you have any records of invoices that Isibonelo may have issued to Premier Attraction for these amounts?     And is it possible Mr X that Isibonelo was doing work for Premier Attraction and being owed these amounts of money without you knowing that it was doing the work?     That clarifies it, I am indebted Chair and Ms Khumalo thank you.   Mr X Mr Talenthe Myeni’s evidence yesterday was effectively that what you are telling the Commission now is a lie, because he says that this work was done and as a result of that Premier Attraction owed Isibonelo just more than R3million.   In thelight of that I want to ask you whether your evidence today has been untruthful?     Thank you.    Mr X is there any way in which you are going to benefit from giving the evidence that you have given today?     And do you lose anything by giving the evidence today?    And Mr X has your evidence, giving your evidence yesterday and today affected your family in any way?     Why were at the neighbours?     And Mr X you indicated in your in camera application to this Commission that your daughter had received a call on the 24 t h of January this year.  Can you please tell us about that call?       And how did your family react to receiving that call?    Thank you Chair, those are our questions.     No Chair, not at all.    I think that is us for the day, Chair.     Yes, Chair I have given up estimating time, I told my learned Junior that he must just stop me, I must give no expectation.     Chair, tomorrow there is another In-Camera application which will need to be dealt with initially and then there are Witnesses dealing with State Security matters.     I think normal time should be fine Chair, indeed. 
INTERPRETER:  How long Chair, is it how long?   Yes Sir.    Yes okay.    Thank you Chair I will …    I am not sure if I am getting him right.  May I try and then Chair you would correct me.    I think he needs – sorry may I correct?    Meaning the money that he moved to the side?    Ja.  Would you please repeat and speak a little bit louder.  I was trying to make it clear what I am requesting from him.    Okay.    Is it paragraph 150?    Is it possible that I can have …?    No.    Thank you Chair.    I have found it.    39, page 160.  Ja.    May I also read it so that I can understand it before I interpret it Chair?    Oh.  My - my apologies - my apologies Chair.    Is it - did you mention the paragraph?    Did you say page 50?    Is it 20 April 2015?     The question was, sorry?      Though I don’t understand the last part Chair but Chair may I interpret then I will be corrected?     Thank you very much Chair.     You said the page?     The next one is on page?     Is it 2015, or 16.       Okay.  [Intervenes]     2015.  Yes.  The question was, sorry.      Oh.  It is Premier Attraction 1016CC.       Did you say 114?       What account number is that, I mean?     Oh.  Oh, okay.  My apologies, Chair.      Oh.  You mean on the.       I went to the wrong… my apologies.  [Intervenes]   2015 till?    Page?    Meaning at the time when she was working with Ms Myeni?    I hope I got it right Chair.    Is it houses?    African Language.    I hope I got it right.    The date was?   I am not sure if I got the question.   Yes.    Can I just get clarity whether I was looking at the account that there is still this money or when Ms Myeni then contacted him because I am not sure.    Page?    Premier …   Premier Attraction.    11 December 20 …?    Can I just get clarity when she - he says forward it to me how?     Did your company, I did not get that?
