CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Hulley, good morning everybody.    Are we ready?    Yes.    Please administer the oath or affirmation.    You may be seated.      Mr Hulley will you please tell your team to also write bundle.    Ja.    Bundle LEA17.   Well I can tell you that on not writing bundle you are not the only ones.    I think yesterday we had a similar situation.    Okay alright.   You see at – you will see one number on the top left corner it is in black and then there will be another one on the top right hand corner it will be red so when Mr Hulley refers you to page numbers he will refer to – he will be referring to the black number on the top left corner.   And – and although it says 004 he will just say page 4.  He will not mention the zeros.  You got it?    Ja.    Yes.  Ja.    Yes okay.     Sorry, Mr Hulley, I think I am on a wrong page.  What was the page?  I think I am on 21.     Oh, 29, not 21.     Okay, I thought that was 21.  29?     Okay.     We have reached the short break.    Fine.  We take the short break.  How much time do you think you will need with Brigadier Ncube?     Ja.     Okay.  No, that is fine.    No, it is fine.  We will take the short adjournment and resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Let us continue.     So are you saying – you are saying the process is if you start the investigation you proceed until you have completed it.  After that you hand over the docket to the NPA to decide whether to prosecute or not to prosecute.     That is what you are saying.    So, in other words, you wanted to be able to say there is somebody else other than us put things – there is something to be investigated here.    Okay.     Mr Hulley?     I know what counsel for Brigadier Ncubeand yourself discussed with me in chambers but I do want to say if at all possible, let us try and see if you cannot finish your questioning of this witness by half past twelve.     Ja because I think I must just say this, it is not so clear that whatever fights there may have been between different sections of the – between the police andIPID.  It is not so clear that it connect properly to the terms of reference.     So let us see if by half past twelve we have a better picture that it does.     Okay.     Yes.  No, he is asking a further question now.  He is not challenging your – well, maybe I should not say that.  He is asking a different question but which might be related to the one he asked earlier on.  Earlier on he asked whether you opened a case against IPID members.     And you said no.  So now he is asking whether does that mean that they were not charged?     I just want to say, Mr Hulley, just in casewhat I said earlier on might be misinterpreted.  I do not mean that Brigadier Ncube should not get a chance to deal with any allegations that may have been made against him that might put him in a bad light out there but I just want us not to take too long.     Ja.     What is the basis for you thinking that it is because of a directive?  Is there something you seethere which gives you that meaning?     Of course, nothing there indicates that there was a directive issued.  It may be that there was a directive issued, it may be that there was no directive.  He decided that there was a loophole or there was some aspect that needed clarification and he decided the way to sort that out is to get an addendum, is it?  Yes, unless you say from your experience you know that whenever an addendum is added like this it is normally because there is a directive from the relevant advocate in the NPA, unless that is this case, but otherwise, from what you have read here, you cannot say it is because of a directive.     Okay.     One second, Mr Hulley?  Thank you.     Remember to look at black numbers.    Ja, just always remember when page numbers are mentioned look at the black numbers.     Okay, alright.     We are at 12    Alerting you.      We are at half past Mr Hulley.      If I am missing anything you must tellme so far the picture I am getting is not one that suggests that whatever evidence has been given with regard to Brigadier Ncube connects to whatever he may have done to any state capture or corruption but if I am missing something you must tell me.           So it seems that it may have – there may have been wrong doing, there might not have been wrong doing but it might not be the kind of wrong doing that the Commission is really interested in.           If that understanding is correct it would seem to methat if there is anything that he wants to cover that has not been covered just to put his side of the story, then he should be allowed to put his side of the story in relation to those particular allegations that might not have been covered but if I am missing something we can look at it.             So you got involved in the investigation relating to IPID as well as General Phahlane because you were instructed to be part of a team that would do investigation, is that right?  You got involved in the investigation team because you were instructed to get involved in the investigation team.    It was not your own decision to say?    You want to get involved?    Yes,  yes.  Okay.      Hm.    Okay thank you.  Does Mr Joubert intend re-examining anything?   Sorry?    Yes okay alright.  They have sanitised the podium before you go there.    Thank you Mr Joubert.  Thank you very much Brigadier Ncube.  If a need arises you may be asked to come back but for today you are excused.  Okay.  We are at ten to one.  I guess that we – it is convenient that we take the lunch adjournment.  As I indicated to counsel inchambers, I will take a longer lunch than normal up to half past two to enable me to attend to something important relating to the work of the commission. So we are going to resume at half past two.  We adjourn.    Let us continue.  You may be seated.  Please switch on your mic.    Okay alright.   Thank you.  You may be seated.  AdvocateHulley.  Yes, okay.  You may continue.    On a lighter note.  This title would make people who are not familiar with these titles is that it is major general, it is higher than a general. [laughs]    That is not the case, is it?    Ja.    [laughs]  Ja.    Okay let us have it done again.    Thank you.  Well, if they still did not hear, it can be recorded that he has taken the oath two times.  [laughs]      We cannot do better than that.   Have you explained to him about the black numbers and the red numbers?    So whenever he refers to a page number, he will be referring to that black number.  Number 1, number 2.  He will not say 0004 for example.  He will just say page 4.   So for you to follow.  Ja.    Try and look this side as you give your answers because I am the person that have to ...[intervenes]     You are not telling him.   He is asking you the questions.    I need to be able to see and hear you properly.    No, it is fine.    I am sorry, Mr Hulley.  I missed your question.  I just want to understand his answer in the context of the question.    Yes, okay.  Okay and the answer was thatyou did not ask?    But you elaborated.  Just tell me your elaboration on that.    Is that normal in your experience?   Oh, is that so?    Okay is there either certain types of cases where that is, in respect of which, that is normal or it is all types of cases?  There is no specific... there are no specific categories of cases?    There is such a practise?    okay.   Well, what you are on... the only thing you are expected to say Major General Mabula is what you know.    If you do not know that it is according to specific categories of cases, obviously, you cannot say it is according to specific categories.    But if you do know that it is according to specific categories, that is what you say.    Okay.    Or maybe it is the car that he was driving.    [laughs]      The 30t h of...?    2016?    Okay.     When you consulted with Advocate Mzinyathi were you seeking his opinion of the case so that you could see whether he thought it was something worth investigating or were you just consulting him not necessarily seeking his opinion or did you need his approval before you could embark on the investigation?     Yes.  He could say if he said what areyou investigating here, there is nothing, would that have been the end of the investigation that was about to start?     If his opinion was that you should not investigate, there are no grounds to investigate?     Is it something you do not know?     It has never happened?     Okay.  But you – if he said his opinion was that you should continue then you would continue definitely?     Okay, alright.  Are the circumstanceswhere – or let me ask this question this way.  What types of investigations do you need an opinion from somebody from the NPA before you can embark on them?  Is it all investigations?     This was the first time?     Yes.    And what made you take this unusual step of seeking an opinion from somebody from the NPA on this occasion?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    Okay, okay, you were unsure.     Whether it would be regarded as proper to proceed.     And you wanted that kind of backing to know that somebody in the NPA thinks it is fine to do it.     Okay.     Just back onto the question I asked you. At this stage when you consulted Advocate Mzinyathi what did you – what information did you place before him for him to give you and informed opinion?     Yes.     And his opinion was it is justified topursue the investigation here.     Yes, okay.    Alright.     Prior to you being asked to lead this investigation did you know the then Acting National Commissioner personally as opposed to simply knowing that he is the Acting National Commissioner, is itsomebody you had had any interactions directly with?     And would that relationship just as a professional level?     And that is all that there was?     Okay.     You are too far from the mic, Mr Hulley.    Have you got the right bundle, Major General Mabula?  To see whether you have the right bundle you must look on the spine of the bundle. MAJOR GENERAL     You have got the right bundle?     Okay.  Is it the one we have been using?     Oh, okay.     If you do not know you can say you donot know.     We are at half past three, I do not know how, Mr Hulley, you may be pacing yourself in terms of important issues, so I want you to just bear that in mind.     So that you …[intervenes]     Ja, keep an eye so that we get to the important aspects of his evidence.    Do you have a sense of how much time you think you need?     Let us see how – where we are in thenext 30 minutes.     But try and look for those important features on his evidence.     It could not be against the acting National Commissioner.     Ja, no I think – now I understand.  He is saying, you were – you conducted an investigation because it was alleged that there had been a threat to the acting National Commissioner.     So, he’s question is, arising out of thatinvestigation was there any charge of intimidation against anybody that was preferred?     Yes okay.     Well, I think what he is saying, what he is asking is, when you say there was a charge of intimidation was it against one of the persons that we have mentioned or was it against more than one, if so, say who– who it was.     As far as you recall.    And who was it…[intervenes].     Okay, alright.     Maybe, let’s – let me ask the question inthis way.  These other charges that Mr Hulley has mentioned to you, did they arise from the investigation that you conducted?  Yes, did you conclude, in yourinvestigation, that such charges should be preferred?     We as a team, ja.     You did not and you did not make a recommendation?     That such charges should be included.     Okay, so I presume you prepared thereport after the investigation, is that right?     Yes, and you just placed facts as you understood them?     And left it to whoever had to make a decision as to what charge to prefer?     You made no recommendations as to what charge should be preferred?    Okay.     Have you moved to another Bundle from …[intervenes].     23?     Ja, isn’t that the one we have been having all along?     Okay but is that the one you have now, is it the right one?     Okay, alright, you must always just look on the spine to see if it’s the right Bundle, that’s where it’s written LEA23, okay, page 60, is that right Mr Hulley?     Sorry?     Oh, yes okay.    I’m sorry, did you ever have, in your possession, such a report or ever see it?    You never saw it?      So, the quotation that Mr Hulley referred to, how did you come to have that quotation in your statement, if you didn’t see such a report?     Or was this a letter, I see in – what you were reading Mr Hulley is, what is at page 62 isn’t it?      61?     Oh, okay, well page 5 – I mean 5.1 says, “I became aware thereof since my involvement in this matter at end of November that Crime Intelligence conducted a security breach investigation around November 2016 on the former acting National Commissioner.  5.2 I also became aware thereof since my involvement as a result ofthis investigation by Crime Intelligence.  A report was submitted under reference CSI Inquiry, in this report it was conveyed as follows”,And then you quote but you couldn’t – you wouldn’t have quoted if you didn’t see that.     But if it was presented verbally to you itwould be strange that you would quote it the way you have, isn’t it?     Yes, when one looks at the way you have quoted it, one would imagine that you had seen thereport.     But you say you don’t know whether you did see it, you don’t know whether you did not see it.      But would it be correct to say you would not quote something that you haven’t seen?     Yes, you can’t quote something you havenot seen.      So, we – it’s fair to say, you must have seen it…[intervenes].     If it existed.     And if it didn’t exist, of course, that would be something else.     Ja, okay, Mr Hulley.     Well, of course, Mr McBride gave his evidence last year.    And I would have imagined that after he gave evidence and you applied for leave to cross-examine him, you would have checked documentation that you have and that you might need and obviously this would have been in the content report.    Yes, have you tried, over the past year or so to find that report, with other people who might have known about it?    So you have tried to locate it.    As we speak are you in a position to say you over the past year since Mr McBride gave evidence you know that you have tried everything to try and get it or are you saying you have not tried everything?   You have not tried everything?    Ja why did you not try everything to get it?    Why did you not try everything to try and find it?    Yes but obviously it is quite an important   And –    And I would keep arguing that you want tochallenge Mr McBride’s evidence that you would want to do your homework, get whatever documents you may have based your investigations on.    Hm yes.  But you say you have not tried everything to try and find it?    Hm.   But – but you – do you say you never had it in your possession because even seeing it maybe somebody allowed you to see it but said do not take it away.  Or are you saying I actually do not know whether it exists?    So as you sit there are you able to positively say such a report did exist or did not exist?    You cannot safely say.    Yes.      Okay.    We are at five past four maybe we should take a short break.  You – I take it you are not far from finishing your …   Ja.    Ja.  When – when – we will take a short break.    Well let – let us try and have some agreement first.  We will take a short break now maybe forup to twenty past and then we will come back.  What you – we were dealing with now may have been important.  You say how much more time do you think you need?  You had initially indicated I think an hour which would – which should expire at half past four.  Where – what do you think howmuch time do you think you need?    But in terms of time?  How much time?      Because I think – I think I would like that…    Mr McBride be cross-examined insofar as Counsel for regarding Major General Mabula may need to cross-examine him.  So I would like that to be done today ifpossible.    But I do not want us to sit here forever.    And that part would need about how much time?    Hm.  Mr Joubert we normally stop at four but we – we are going beyond that.  From your side is that fine?    Yes okay.   It is in order.  Where is Counsel for Mr McBride?  What is your situation and your client’s situation?  Yes do you have an idea how long – in terms of those commitments what is the latest he might wish to leave here?  Oh okay alright.  Okay alright let us take a ten minutes break.    And then we will come back and resume.  Mr Joubert what is your estimate of how long you might bewith Mr McBride?    Okay alright.  Okay.  Thank you.  We will take a short adjournment we will resume at twenty past.    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Good afternoon, Mr Notshe.   I apologise to Mr Hulley and to counsel for Major General Mabula and their clients because we interposing while we are having another matter to just deal with this urgent matter.  I understand from the discussions that there are challenges with proceeding on Monday with the evidence that are supposed to be led on Monday.    Why so long?    I think more attempts should be made to have them all of them filed by end of next week if possible and only if really it is impossible should we go the week after because ...[intervenes]     Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja, okay.    Ja.    Ja.    Let them place themselves on record but finish what you need to do so that I do not have to come back to you about what you might have to say.   If there is anything further you want to say before they come on record.    Ja, okay alright.  Alright.  Let them come on record.  Oh, I think they must sanitise before you... they must just sanitise the place before you use it.      Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.    Yes.    Yes.    Last year?    Yes.  Yes, okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Did you want to...[intervenes]    Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.  The arrangement about your postponement is agreed?    Ja.    Yes.    I am aware about the wish to look at two days.  I am not... I have not made up my mind but I am aware of the suggestion.  But when the next date is determined, I will apply my mind whether it should be two days.I know that Mr Notshe also seems to think that we should do that but we will see.  We even have evening sessions now.      Because we are running against time.  So but I will apply mind to that when I set it down again.    Yes.    Yes, I am aware.  It is just that I thinkthere are two letters.    The first one reached me after it had reached other people first and then so I was the last one to get it.  And then within a few days I got the next one.  One, in terms of the procedure as to whether cross-examination will start or whether your client will first give evidence, I propose to decide that on the first day on the day.Obviously, I have seen that you have maderepresentations in your letter.    But I think what you ought to do is simple be ready for either situation, you know.    If it goes your way, then all the better.  But just be ready so that we do not have to adjourn because maybe ...[intervenes]     Ja.   Ja, I think that was the one.  There was the other one I remember about leading your witness.    That one I would... if you want to addressme on that day, I will let you do that.  But if you what you have written, you believe it is enough, I can make... announce my decision then as well.    Ja.    Ja.  And then I cannot remember the third one.    Yes, I think that probably, it should be done so that, if at all possible, maybe there is one common bundle.    I think that is what you wanted.    Yes.    I think that will be convenient.    Yes.   I think that will be convenient.    Ja.  No, no.  I think that one would be convenient for everybody.  It should be done, ja.     No but thank you very much.  The hearing of Ms Wakeford’s evidence and the cross-examination of Mr Agrizzi and Mr Vosloo, I think, that was scheduled for Monday is postponed to a date that is still to be determined. Thank you very much.    Thank you.  Thank you.  You are excused.    Okay alright.  Oh, I am sorry.  Counsel for Mr Agrizzi.  I got the impression that you had not... you go to the podium.  That is why I have not allowed you to say anything.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes, yes.    Thank you very much.    Thank you.  Thank you, alright.  Mr Hulley, we can proceed.  They will sanitise first the podium.  Andthen Major General Mabula can come back.  Mr Hulley, are you tempted to give you five instead of ten minutes to finalise the questions relating to Mr McBride?  Do you think that is too harsh?    [laughs]      Ja, okay.  No, continue.    Okay and then after you have done that then, of course, go straight to the questions that relates to Mr Booysen.    Okay.   Yes?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh, okay.    Oh.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Sorry.  You are going back to the issue of the report?    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Yes, on the 30t h.    Ja.    You forgot the name?    H’m.    The report was part of ...[intervenes] MAJOR GENERAL    Yes.    Yes.    Oh, okay.    Yes, yes.   So you are in a position to say, you do remember that you saw it?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.   Yes, okay.    So you are able to say such a report did exist?    You saw it.    And Mr Moyane had it?    From that report.    Yes.   Okay.    Okay.    Alright.    When he quoted from.  It means he quoted from it.   Well, obviously, if the report does exist and it is found, it clarifies at least something about the fact that it existed.  So do you know whether you can, now that you remember, who had it that you have good chances of getting a copy of it?    Ja, okay.    Did you say 56?    Five, six.      Sorry, what is the question?    Is the report that she refers to in paragraph 3 at page 57 a different report?    Yes.    Yes.  So what is the question?    Ja but how is Major General Mabula going to explain why they choice not to quote it?    I do not understand.  He quoted the report and he now says he does remember that the report did exist and he saw it.  The comment to this affidavit, Makhele in paragraph 3 talks about the same report.  So she is aware it existed.  The fact that she might not quote it ...[intervenes]     It does not mean any problems for him.     I do not understand why that is important.  He... they were consulting with counsel.  One of them had, namely Mr Moyane had the report, counsel quoted it in hisstatement.  This deponent refers to the report, does not quote it, probably because she does not see the need.  I am not sure that I understand why that part is important.    No, he cannot help you on that.  He cannot help you.    But also Mr Hulley.  With the limited time that you asked for that I gave you, I am not sure who the attorney was will really assist us.   No, I think you can get it from Mr Moyane.    Are you moving onto questions relating to Major General Booysen?    Ja, please finalise within two minutes.    Then let us move to the questions relating to General Booysen.    Well, I am saying finalise within two minutes so that we can move towards questions relating to Major General Booysen.    That is LEA23?    And it is page two...?    236.   I am sorry, Mr Hulley.  What is the point with these cell phone records?    The day before.  I mean, he occupies a certain position within the SAPS.  Phahlane was Acting National Commissioner.  Is there something that we are pursuing in here?    But is there a factual basis for us to think that there is something important about him having... the two of them having met on the day?    That will be the last question.  Please say something.    Ja.     I will give you twenty minutes ratherthan thirty  minutes.  We are at ten to five so we have got to ten past five then let us see whether within twenty  instead of thirty minutes you cannot make it.     I am sorry, just repeat the previous sentence?  When you say – you said [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] Just tell me that again?     I missed something when you said you said you know what happened then you talk about six advocates.  I want you to repeat that because I did notcatch it.     That is now Advocate Jiba.     Yes, Advocate Jiba.     So you asked for one, you got six.    Yes, they have been very persuasive.     That is what I am saying     Okay.  Who was speaking now, saying …[intervenes]     At the – in Durban now?     Okay.     So ultimately it was five who came, not six?     Oh, okay.     Okay, yes.     Yes, no but what you are saying is important to this …[intervenes]     But as I understood your evidence earlier, the purpose of your meeting with Advocate Jiba was to secure – a prosecutor would be dedicated to the Cato Manor investigation.    Now when you say you never said you want one, I am not sure that I understand that because you must have said something and you would not – you would either have said we need a prosecutor or we needprosecutors.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     So are you saying that at that meeting you yourself did not say you want one or two?     But Advocate Jiba spoke on the basis or spoke as if she had been told that you were looking for oneprosecutor.     Because you say she said I do not think you need one.     Ja.     Okay.  But from what you are now saying it seems that even though you might not have said to herwe want one.     But in terms of what you said you were looking for one because in fact which and you said Maema , you did not say Maema and so and so and so.     And then she said I do not think you need one, you need more.     Ja, okay.    On a light note you must have been quite happy with so many.     You heated that pot, you had six advocates.     Okay, alright.     Could you face this side so I can hear you.     Okay.     Well, it might not have intended the meaning that you are attaching to it but of course he can speak for himself.  He might have used the word charge loosely.     Mr Hulley?     Maybe let us deal with it this way.  You gave evidence earlier on with regard to the investigation.     Relating to the threat or alleged threat against General Phahlane.     And you said you conducted the investigation but you make no recommendations as to whoshould be charged and what charge should be preferred against them.     You remember you said that?  In regard to the Cato Manor investigation did you make any recommendations as to who should be charged and with what they must be charged?     No.     Yes.  You did not …[intervenes]     Of any discussion where maybe other people express such views?    You were?  You say you were?     Or you were part?     Okay.     Ja.     Yes.     Well, they might value your opinion because you have been in the police for a long time.  Theymight say Major General Mabula, what do you think, is there enough evidence and you might say I do not think so or you might say yes, I think so, but you are the lawyers, you must make up your mind.     Yes.     Ja.     So you never expressed any view.     Or recommendation?     Okay, alright.     Mr Hulley…     We are four minutes away from the time that you had asked for, it was 30 minutes, so…     Well, do you want to say what decisions you are talking about?     So whether the investigation had been completed?    So you are asking whether they …[intervenes]     You are asking the two of them.       He is asking whether you and the leader of the IPID’s teams discussed jointly, whether at a certain stage the investigation was complete.    Yes.     Ja.     Ja, okay.     I think he said so.  I understood Major General Mabula to say with regard to whether the investigation was finalised, that is something that they discussed.    Is that right?     Yes.     Ja.     Well, how is that different from I said that he agrees that he has said that they talked to eachother to reach agreement that the investigation is now complete.     Or you want to see whether they were unanimous ...[intervenes]      ...the investigation at a certain point was complete.     Major General Mabula?     You were agreed?     Okay.     Mmm.     Yes, yes.  The next two questions will be the last ones?     Okay I am listening.     Well he said he never made any decision or expressed a view about whether there was enough evidence for any charge.     He said they conducted an investigationand reached a point where they said this investigation is now complete and the prosecutors were to take a decision whether or not the evidence was sufficient for any charge.     Yes.     Yes, I think he has made it clear that he did not express any view about whether the evidence was sufficient or anybody should be charted or not, he left that to the lead prosecutors to decide.    Okay.     You have done your two questions.     Yes.   Is there any important feature of Major Booysen’s evidence that has not been covered?   Is there any particular point?     Sorry?     But you – are you suggesting that Major General Mabula made that decision?     Major General Mabula did you get involved in a decision about is arrest?     Thank you.    Hmm, yes.    Mmm.     Okay, is there any e-examination you wish to do Mr Joubert?  Somebody must sanitise the podium.     Sorry?     Ja, okay.     Which bundle?     Okay and what page?    Okay.     Bundle LEA 23,     It is that one.    Have you got it?     Page 19 on the black numbers.     Mmm, okay, ja.     Thank you.   Thank you very much Major General Mabula, you are now excused – oh your counsel might ...[intervenes]     Yes, okay thank you.   You are excused Major General Mabula.   Mr Hulley?   Your mic.     Ja, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.     Thank you Mr McBride.   Thank you.   Mr Joubert?  Mr Joubert the cross-examination will be on behalf of both Brigadier Ncube and Major General Mabula?      Okay, alright.   You may go ahead.     The alleged security breach?     I am sorry, the alleged threat?    I think what Mr Joubert maybe doing is to seek your comment on a proposition that says when onelooks at the role that they played in this investigation it seems to have been too active – they seem to have been too active or more active than they should have been.  They should not have allowed to be.  Maybe the investigators should have said, well we know that you – you are availableto assist us but we are in control of this process.  We will tell you if we need anything if you are going to be with us as we go to that place just listen to us.  So – so that you do not appear like you in charge of this process.  I think that is the proposition in which he would like you to hear what you have to say about that.    Ja.      So maybe just to complete that point speaking generally would you accept that their involvement seemed to seemed – seems to have been more than normal but whether in the particular case it was justified is something you leave to the investigators to deal with? Would it be fair to say that is how look at it generally and in – and on the particular circumstances?    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    I am sorry I think Mr McBride wants tohave a look at the particular page.  If you are going to ask    Yes.    Well I am not sure I followed the question.  Do you want to repeat the question so I can evaluate it but I know you are talking about criticism?    Ja okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you – thank you very much Mr McBride.     Thank you for coming to make yourself available.  Thank you to everybody for staying until late so that we could complete what we can.  I take it that Mr Joubert you had no question – you did not seek to pursue any cross-examination of Major General Booysen?    Yes okay.    Okay alright.  Thank you very much Mr McBride you are excused.  Thank you.      And that is the end of a long day.   Okay we are going to adjourn for the sake of those who may be watching or listening and the public we will not have a sitting tomorrow and on Monday but I think on Tuesday we will have a sitting.  Thank you very much to everybody for staying on until this time.  We adjourn. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Good morning Mr Chair.    We are ready to proceed Mr Chair.    Mr Chair this morning’s or todays’ session is going to concern the evidence of Brigadier Ncube.  He has been granted leave to cross-examine MrMcBride.  The evidence of General Mabula will also be led today and he is being implicated by Mr McBride and General Booysen and Mr Chair you have granted leave to – for him to cross-examine both of those witnesses.  Mr Chair there are quite a few bundles but hopefully we can get through all the bundles with quite – quite briefly.  There is the bundles in relation to Mr – sorry in relation to General Booysen and that is the Z series of bundles.  Then there is the bundle of Mr McBride and that is a YA –D series and then there is some additional bundles that havebeen created in the – specifically in relation to Brigadier Ncube and in relation to General Mabula.  They range from Y17 all the way up to Y26.  The – we anticipate that the evidence will not be too long but of course one cannot always make an accurate assessment at the beginning.  Iwill commence with leading the evidence of Brigadier Ncube.  I will ask that he be called to the stand.    Good morning Brigadier.    Do I understand that you are still presently a Brigadier?    I would like to take you if you will to Bundle LEA17.  If you turn and look behind you you shouldsee such a bundle.  I understand it is in front of you.  My apologies.  The very document – bundle in front of you.    Mr Chair it is Bundle LEA17.    Yes.  Thank you Mr Chair.    I will indeed do so.      I trust that by early next week we would have sorted out this problem relating to the bundles Mr Chair.    Yes.    Thank you Mr Chair.    Now Brigadier if you would be so kind as to turn to page LEA17 and if you look at the top left hand corner there is a page numbering system it is page 4.  It is in black.      Page 4.      Are you looking at the top left hand corner?    Okay so keep that open Sir with your left hand and then with your right hand if you would notmind turning to page 27 of the same document.      Now the signature that appears below the – the heading this – thus done and signed on this … day of May 2019 at Rosebank above the name PharasaDaniel Ncube is that your signature?    And is that the affidavit that you or the statement that you have deposed to?    And you confirm that this statement is true and correct to the best of your knowledge?    Now Brigadier what I am going to do is I am going to take you through – through your statementbut I am going to highlight the pertinent aspects of your statement and then I am going to ask you some questions in relation to the pertinent aspects.  The – if I understand correctly you have been – you have set out in your affidavit or in the statement at page 2 what the purpose of this application is or the purpose of your application was.  You see that?  Under the heading B.    Sorry Chair the side – I have said page 2 exactly page 5.   Of the same statement.    You have dealt on page 6 the followingpage with your educational background.    And if you turn – if you proceed to page – sorry – to page 15 you will see there you deal with the appointment of the investigation team.  Have you got it page 15 top left hand corner at the foot of the page you    Look right at the bottom of the page.   On page 15.  You have got the right page Sir or at least you had it.  Look at the bottom of the page.  You will see the heading Appointment to the investigation team.    Now the specific issue that you have been called here to – to respond to relates to the allegations that have been made by Mr McBride who was at– who was at IPID the Executive Director of IPID at a point in time.  That correct?    Now if I understand correctly and if you could turn back to – with me to page 11 of the samedocument.  Between the years 2008 and 2009 you were the Section Commander of the Phokeng Organised Crime Unit.    And between 2009 and 2013 you were the Unit Commander of the Klerksdorp Organised Crime Unit.    The following page on page 12.    And then on page 13 between 2013 andyou said to date but I imagine that the date that you referring to was the date of the signing of this statement you were the – you were the Unit Commander of the Tlhabane Organised Crime Unit.  Is that correct?    Ja it is 2013 to date.    And I imagine that the date is May of 18 when you signed this affidavit, is that right?    Okay.  Sorry where is that referred to over here?  I am just – what year was that?  When did you become the Branch Commander?   Of Commercial Crime.    Yes.    So let us just go back then to that heading that you have got.  You have got it in bold face 13 to date.  It says Unit Commander Thlabane Organised Crime Unit.  Are you saying that that is incorrect?   Let me just understand that – the Thlabane Organised Crime Unit were you ever the Unit Commander of that unit?    And what was the time period of that?    Okay and when did you become the – when did you become the Provincial Head of the – do I understand correctly did you say the DPCI?    And when was that?    What year was that?    Okay.  Now in 2016 when you commenced the investigation or when you were made part of the team that was conducting the investigation into the security breach at the acting National Commissioner ’sresidence where were you stationed at that point?    Okay.  And at that point in time you happened to be stationed in the North West Province, correct?   Now in – if I understand correctly you had been involved in a number of operations together with certain other members that were involved in this particular team to conduct the investigation into the security breachat the acting National Commissioner ’s residence.  Is that correct?    You had been appointed to a team from the North West that was conducting an investigation into a security breach that apparently took place at the acting National Commissioner ’s residence, is that correct?   And do you recall the date on which you were appointed to that team?    Now prior to that had – and sorry if I can just take you to the letter of appointment.  I believe it is in – in General Ncube – so sorry General Mabula’s statement.  If you will turn with me if you look behind you there is a bundle behind you and if you look at LEA26. Now if you would turn with me Mr Chair to page 35 of that bundle?  Got it?    Top left hand corner.    Now this is a document that is attached to the affidavit or the statement of General Mabula.  It is addressed to the Deputy Provincial Commissioner Crime Detection South African Police Service North West and the heading of the letter is Mandate to conduct investigation security threat against the acting National Commissioner counter and security intelligence inquiry 2/10/2016.  Do you see that document?    Now do you – have you seen thisdocument previously?    And do you see – did you see it at the time that you happened to be appointed to the team that was set up to investigate this threat?    You were appointed if I understand correctly on the 30 November of 2016.  My question is did you see it at that point in time when you were appointed tothe team in other words on the 30 t h November 2016?    Okay so when you say you were contacted.    Before the letter?    Was it on the – was it before you saw the letter or was it before the 30 November?    And do you recall the date?    Was it one or two days, three days, a week?    Right.  Now if you turn to paragraph 2 of that letter you will see he talks about the appointment the heading is Appointment of team to conduct   And on your understanding who was the leader of the team?   And on your understanding the – the investigation that had to be conducted was an investigation into a security threat, is that correct?    Okay.  Now what my – to go back to the earlier question that I had asked you in relation to thisteam.  Had you conducted investigations previously with the other members of this team as part of a team?    As a team.    Correct.    Hm.   Okay.  Any other teams – any other investigations?    Okay.  But did you and General Mabulaor you and any of these other members as part of a team conduct any investigations outside of the North West Province?    Not currently before – before thisinvestigation had you ever conducted an investigation as part of a team with any of these members whether it is with one member, two members or all the members outside of the North West Province?    Now the Cato Manor investigation that was down in KwaZulu Natal, is that correct?    And do you recall how you got to beinvolved in that team?    Could you tell us?    And pursuant to … BRIGADIER    And pursuant to that investigation youhappened to arrest General Booysen if I recall correctly?    And if my memory serves me right you in fact arrested him on two occasions.  Once in 2012 and once subsequent to that, is that correct?   Okay.  Brigadier if you could just speak into the microphone, I am told that your voice – people are not picking up your voice.    Thank you.  Now if you would turn – go back to Bundle LEA17.  Now you say at the top of that    Now is the date that you have indicated there correct because if I understand correctly you say –you testified a moment ago that you had in fact been informed that you would be part of this team prior to – prior to 30 November 2016?    So did… BRIGADIER    So this date over here in paragraph 10 of your statement is incorrect it should in fact be during November?    And your understanding was that the investigation had – had been mandated by whom?    Now – and who had authorised theappointment of a team from North West to come and conduct an investigation in respect of an incident that apparently took place in Gauteng?    Once the team had been established were there any meetings that took place immediately after the team had been established?  In other words, a meeting between you, the other members of the team and any – any additional party?    So there was a meeting with Crime Intelligence investigation team and that regarded as a briefing session?    Were you present at that meeting?    And were the other members of your team also present?    And who was present from Crime Intelligence?   Okay.  But you are saying that at least those two people were present, Makhele and Motswenyane?    Are you saying that were additional people from Crime Intelligence, you just do not remember their names or are you saying that you do not rememberwhether there were additional people?    Yes.  And when they gave you a briefing – I can imagine that the briefing was given to your team by Crime Intelligence?    And who was speaking?    And other than to speak was there a presentation of any sorts?  Was there either a slide-show or was there a pack?  Was there documents that were presented?    And at that stage, what did you understand to be the concern, other than the threatening emails?    Ja?    But remember, we are still talking at this stage about the briefing session.   This is what was... were you informed about this at the briefing session?    And they get... we know that they gave you certain emails that of a threatening nature.    The emails were part of the threatinvestigations.  That, in other words, the threat investigation that you had to conduct, your team?    Now you spoke earlier on about a security assessment.  Just explain what you are referring to. BRIGADIER    And when you say they, you are referring to Crime Intelligence that conducted such assessment?   And if I understand, what was the conclusion or the assessment that Crime Intelligence had reached?    Now what was it... so Crime Intelligence, if I understand it correctly, has come to the conclusion which they communicated to you, your team in this briefing session that there was a threat to the life of Acting National Commissioner.  Do I understand that correctly?    And your function in relation to the conclusion of the assessment that had been conducted byCrime Intelligence was to do what?    Was it supposed to be a criminal investigation or was it supposed... was it something different?    Well... no, no.  Let us step a step back.  At the briefing session you were informed of the threat assessment that... or the security assessment that had been conducted by Crime Intelligence.  Crime Intelligence came to the conclusion that there was a threat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner.  Your instruction or your mandate was to conduct an investigation.  If I understand correctly, it was an investigation into the threat of the life of the Acting National Commissioner.    Now once you had completed your investigation, according to the instruction that you had been given at that briefing session, what were you then to do?    So if I understand correctly what - pursuant to the question that I had asked earlier on – therewas not necessarily an instruction given to you at the briefing session about what the investigation should entail.  That was left to the team.  Do I understand that correctly?    Okay.  And at that briefing session, was there any instruction given to?  I am not, at this point in time, concerned with what happens after the briefing session.  I want to know at the briefing was there an instruction given to you about what you should do once the investigation is complete?    Now the date of the briefing session, do you recall what that date was?    And the meeting with Advocate Mzinyathi in Pretoria, do you recall what date was?   So you travelled to Pretoria to meet with Advocate Mzinyathi on the 30 t h of November?    So you say... sorry.  That the briefing with Crime Intelligence took place in Pretoria.  So you simple travelled to the offices of the DPP?    I see sir.  Now let us just move forward now to deal with the actual investigation that was conducted. You would have a meeting first with your team leader, General Mabula, to discuss the way forward.  Is that correct?    But after the briefing session, did he call a meeting before you went to go and meet with general... oh,sorry, with Advocate Mzinyathi or did you leave Crime Intelligence straight away after the briefing session and simple go to meet with Advocate Mzinyathi?    Now the actual investigation itself, did that investigation entail... was there a meeting that was held between General Mabula and the rest of the team to explain how the investigation was going to unfold and to share the responsibility of who is going to do what?    And were there subsequent meetings held where you provided feedback to General Mabula of your investigations that you have conducted?    So if I understand correctly, you had meetings with Advocate Nemaorane after an initial set of investigations and then you had subsequent meetings with Advocate Johnson.  And what was the other advocate’sname?    Do you recall the date of that meeting where the preliminary investigation report was given?   Sorry, when I say report, what you had reported to Advocate Nemaorane.    And at what stage did they decide that a criminal docket should be opened?    Now let me understand.  By January of 17 when they advised you to open a criminal docket, by that stage, they were of the opinion that there is a case to be answered here.    But at the preliminary investigations or the preliminary... pardon me.  At the presentation that you had given at the preliminary investigation stage, at that stage, they were... they felt that you must conduct further investigations.   Did they express a view as to whether there was a case to be made at that stage or were, they uncertain?    Now speaking about reports, did you at any stage, either in 2016 or before the criminal docket was opened, did you at any stage present – and when I say you, I mean you and/or the rest of your team – present a report relating to the investigation that you had conducted at any point in time?    I want to know whether a report wascompiled?  And by report, I mean something that was either typed or written up in some form that was presented either to the NPA, alternatively, to anybody within the SAPS, whether it be Crime Intelligence, whether it be North West or anybody else?  Was any written report compiled by you and/or the rest of your team relating to the investigation that you had conducted up until the end of 2016, the beginning of 2017 before the criminal docket have been opened?    So a report was compiled?  It was a written report?    And the report was compiled by you, you or your team?    And that report was presented to whom?   And what year was this? BRIGADIER    Are we talking about 2016, 2017 or 2018?    So what I am trying to understand for present purposes.  At what stage did you and your teamcome to the conclusion that having conducted the investigation there was indeed a security threat to the life of the then Acting National Commissioner Phahlane? BRIGADIER    So if I understand your response correctly, you are saying that you did not come to theconclusion yourself necessarily that there was or was not a threat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner at the time.  Instead, you had just obtained statements.  You have placed those statements before members of the NPA for them to make that assessment.    Now let me understand.  At what stage did it come about that your investigation had been broadened to determine whether there was any crime committed?  Had your mandate or the scope of your investigation been broadened to determine whether there was any crime committed?  My understanding was that your mandate was to determine whether there had been a threat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner.    Yes and I understand that but I want to... I am asking a slightly different question.  When you were initially appointed, I understood that your mandate was to determine whether there was a threat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner.  That was your mandate.  So what I am asking you now is, was that mandate broadened to include whether there was any crime committed?  That is my question.    Now you then conducted an investigation which you have outlined at page 16 paragraph 11.  And you have identified the names there of several witnesses from whom statements were obtained.  Is that correct?   And you continue identifying a number of witnesses all the way up to page 19 and you identified them as Witnesses 1 to 10.  Is that correct?    Now you say there in paragraph 12 that   If you turn to page 19.    And if you look at paragraph 12.    You say that   And then you say that   And the investigation was against Mr Paul O’Sullivan and Ms Sarah Trent.  Is that correct?    Now at this stage, have you or have you not concluded at this stage whether alone as your team or together with anybody from the NPA’s office, has there beena conclusion reached – and when I say conclusion, I mean in your minds that there is a security threat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner Phahlane at that stage.   BRIGADIER     Okay.  So this warrant of arrest, the J50 warrant of arrest, when was that prepared, do you recall?     Okay.  If you will just bear with me.  If you would turn – if I recall correctly, you applied for a warrant of arrest in February of 2017, is that right?     Just bear with me?  If you would turn with me to bundle LEA18.  If you would turn with me to page 14.       That is right.     Now the – pardon me, actually you have got to start at page 13.  This is the statement in terms of Section 43 of the CPA, that is the CriminalProcedure Act 51 of 1977 and on page 14 are the particulars of the suspects of whom a warrant is sought.  This is the application or the affidavit or the statement that is filed in support of an application for the warrant of arrest, is that correct?     And if you would turn to page 21 you, the deponent, will find that affidavit, is that correct?     Okay.  Now the actual warrant ofarrest, if I understand correctly, was obtained subsequently.  If you turn with me to page – bundle LEA17 at page 29, you have attached a copy of that to your affidavit.     Page 29 of bundle LEA17.     Now that relates to Sarah Jane Trent and if you turn to the following page you will see that thatrelates – that is the warrant of arrest in respect of Mr O’Sullivan.     And if you look at the date stamp at the foot of both documents you will see that it is dated the8 February of 2017.     Pages 29, Mr Chair.     That is correct, Mr Chair.    Now, if I understand correctly, if you go back to bundle LEA18 at page 40(?) in this affidavit, was used in support of the obtaining of those warrants of arrest, is that correct?     Now we will get back to these documents, what I am asking you is before we get to February, when you opened the docket, do I understand your statement correctly that at that stage you understoodthat the case against whoever it is that was being investigated was one of impersonating an IPID official?     When you opened the docket, the docket was opened prior to the 8 February of 2017, is thatcorrect?     In fact, it was opened at the beginning of January of 2017.     Now at the time when that docket was opened your understanding was that the case against the suspects was a case of impersonation of an IPID official.  That is what you say here in your statement.  I am just trying to understand if I, my reading of your statement iscorrect.     Look at page 19 on bundle LEA17.     Have you got LEA17, sir?     Page 19.     Paragraph 12    Okay.  Now what …[intervenes]     Thank you, Mr Chair.     Chair, I will imagine that it probably be another 30 minutes.  I thought it would be less than that.     But it will probably be another 30 minutes.     Thank you, Mr Chair.     Thank you, Mr Chair.   Brigadier Ncube just to – and specifically having regard to the issues that we have got to deal with over years in relation to the purpose for which this Commission has been established, I want to move on and deal with the issues that are specifically relevant to the Commission.Now if I understand correctly, by January 2017 there had been investigations that were conducted by you and your team, statements or affidavits had been obtained,they had been placed before the NPA, Advocate Nemaorane in particular and the decision was taken that this related to the crime of impersonation of an IPID official and a docket was opened to that effect.  The docket was opened in Kameeldrift, which is in Pretoria, is that correct?     Now your team at that stage had conducted its investigation, why was that investigation not – having discharged your mandate, a docket has beenopened, why was that investigation not handed over to the police officials at Kameelsdrift police station and you and the rest of your team return to the North West Province where you are based.     Yes, but if my understanding was correct – and perhaps it was wrong but if my understanding was correct, the specific mandate that had been given to you at the briefing session was that you had to investigate a security threat against the life of the then Acting NationalCommissioner Phahlane.     You had reached a point where you had taken statements from all the witnesses and – so you had taken statements from witnesses, you had presentedthat to the – so you had given an interim presentation to the NPA’s office.  That was followed up with a further presentation that took place towards the end of December, early January.  That second presentation resulted in a criminal charge being laid in Kameelsdrift and a docket being opened.  Now at that stage it seems to me that your mandate is completed because you have conducted your investigation, you have now opened a criminal docket.  What I want to know is, do you agree with me that at that stage your mandate has been discharged or do Imisunderstand?     So, if I understand correctly, your understanding, you would continue to carry the docket, you would continue to conduct the investigations until adecision has been taken to prosecute or not to prosecute.     Now there is a suggestion and I am not sure if I understand the suggestion entirely.  There is a suggestion that this was a prosecutor or an NPA driveninvestigation.  Are you suggesting that.     No, no, I am just trying to understand.  If – my understanding of what you were saying is that youhad gone – you and General Mabula, had gone up to meet with Advocate Mzinyathi.  So it is in fact from your side that you drew him into the investigation in a sense.  That is my understanding.     Now if I understood correctly from your earlier testimony, the purpose of that meeting with Advocate Mzinyathi was to ascertain from him specifically whether it was appropriate for your team to conduct theinvestigation given that IPID was conducting and investigating against the Acting National Commissioner at the time.     But when you say you want to bring him on board, are you saying you want to bring him on board, so that he remains part of the team that he isinvestigating, either him or somebody that he assigns, he is investigating the security threat to the life of General Phahlane or are you saying that you wanted to bring him on board in terms of the fact that what you want to do as the investigation team?  What is the role that is going to be played insofar as the NPA is concerned from that point onwards according to your understanding?     Now after that you continued to conduct the investigation, you got the first few statements, you then open the docket in the earlier part of January of 17.  You then executed or you applied for a warrant of arrest.  You then executed the warrant of arrest on the 10 February 2017, is that correct?     And in terms of the investigation, justtake me through now the Kameelsdrift investigation.  Where did you ultimately land up?  You started with the investigation initially into a security threat against the life of General Phahlane.  It then resulted in a criminal investigation that was about impersonation of an IPID official.  Ultimately, what were all the charges that were brought against Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent?     Yes, Mr Chair.     I know you have got to – you might take longer but …[intervenes]     I will certainly endeavour to do so, Chair.     Thank you, Mr Chair.     No, absolutely.  Thank you, Mr Chair.     Brigadier Ncube, other than Ms Trent and Mr O’Sullivan, you also opened a criminal investigation against certain members of IPID, is that correct?    Were members of IPID not charged on your understanding?     Yes.     Okay.  And do you recall what they were charged with and who was charged?     Absolutely so, Chair.     Now when we – insofar as the charges against the IPID officials are concerned, did I understand correctly that some of the IPID officials were beinginvestigated for defeating the ends of justice in relation to their investigation against General Phahlane?     If you would turn with me, sir, to bundle LEA18, I would like you to turn to page 3.     Sorry, pages 2 and 3.     That is right.    Now this particular statement is a statement of a certain Elvis – sorry, Alwyn Petrus Du Preez and if you turn to page 3, you will see that it is dated the 4 February of 2017 and you will see that the statement istaken by Mr Dawood.  Now Mr Dawood was – or rather, Lieutenant Colonel Dawood was one of the members of your team, is that correct?     Do you know what the purpose of taking this particular statement was?     Sorry, it was pursuant to an instruction or a …[intervenes]     Paragraph 2 of the statement    Are you aware of the directive outside of what you are reading over here?    You were aware of it?     Okay.  Now what was the purpose of obtaining a statement from Mr du Preez?     Thank you, Mr Chair.  You knew that he was the driver of General Phahlane, is that correct?     And you knew that a statement had been obtained from him by IPID, is that correct?     Why was he approached by members of your team on your understanding?  I just want to understand that.  Why was he being approached? BRIGADIER     So, in other words, if I understand  correctly you were conducting an investigation at that stage into the security measures and one of the people that was responsible or one of the people who fell within the parameters of the security measures was the driver of General Phahlane.     Yes.     Okay, so he was relevant witness because he drove General Phahlane and the person who drove General Phahlane would be a person who is relevant to questions relating to the security.  That is what I understand you to be saying.     During the course of the investigation – I am not sure if you met with Mr du Preez at all.  Did you meet with Mr du Preez?     Now, you gave a statement on the 8 December of 2016.  Do I understand correctly that you were present when he gave that statement?     Yes.     If I understand correctly, you actually took a statement from him relating to the events or relatingto the IPID investigation and Mr Paul O’Sullivan.     Okay.  Will you turn to bundle LEA17, to page 337.     337.    337.     That is right and if you turn to page 338.    So the document at page 337 and 338 is one document, it is the statement of Mr du Preez.  In fact, think it is Captain du Preez, is that correct?  Is this his statement, sir?      337.  Have you got bundle LEA17, page 337?     Are you on bundle LEA17?     Are you looking at the top left-hand corner, sir?     Thank you very much, Chair.  Now this is the statement that we were referring to earlier on which you referred to as the first statement, is that correct?     Now according to this statement he     He then talks about in paragraph 3 –     Now he refers to a meeting that took place on the 8 t h of November 2016.  I am trying to understand how you interviewed him on the 8 t h of November of 2016 if you were briefed at the end ofNovember or early December of 2016.      Okay.      So it is possible that he you should be referring to the 8 t h of December of 2016?    Okay.  Now he says - if you turn to page LEA017 at page 338.  He says in paragraph 10 thathe had done nothing about the intimidation/threat towards me as I was not allowed to talk about it and I was reminded more than once that it would be a criminal offence to do so.           I did mention it in my statement to the either about the intimidations/threat towards me in the manner in which the draft statement that was given to me as put the Attorney General Jacob Phahlane in a bad light.  Now he - what I want to know is as far as this his issue is concerned.  Was the allegation or your understanding ofwhat he was asserting over here?       What was your understanding of the point that he was making in paragraph 10?     No, no look at the next part of thesentence he says I did mention it in my statement to IPID about the intimidations/threats towards me and the manner in which the draft statement that was given to me as to put the Attorney General Jacob Phahlane in a bad light.  What I am asking is what was your understanding about what hewas saying in that respect?      Okay.  Was this issue pursued – let me ask you that, was this issue pursued about the painting General Phahlane in a bad light.  Did you continue to investigate what that entails?     Okay.  Let us go back then to thesecond statement which we referred to a month ago in LEA18 at page 2.  Now we spoke about this statement a moment ago and were you aware of why this statement was taken?           I asked you that a month ago you said that it was your understanding based upon the content of paragraph 2 that it would have been pursuant through a directive that had been issued within the DPP’s office.  BRIGADIER     If you go through the statement, he says that on the 25 t h of November 2016 I received astatement from a member of IPID mentioned as Mandla on my email relating to the alleged corruption investigation against the Attorney General Phahlane.  I went through the draft statement and I wish to state that I was not in agreement with the following aspects of the statement.           He then says at the bottom of that page at paragraph 6 the moment which these words were used made the draft statement factually incorrect and it is therefore my view not true.  Now from what I can gather from this statement his complaining about the fact that hehad been sent a draft statement as part of an IPID investigation onto General Phahlane.  Correct?     He says that the – he does not agree with the content of the statement.     And he says that the statement was factually incorrect for various reasons which is outlined in paragraph 5.     Now what I am wanting to understand is why is an investigation now being conducted into the investigation that was being conducted by IPID?     No, no that is not my question.  You were part of the team and of course if you do not have personal knowledge of course say so.  What I am trying to ask you is as a member of the team why was an investigation been conducted by your team into the investigation that have been conducted by IPID?     Now from your side and I have asked you previously about meetings that were held between the team.  But from your side the platoon your team meet frequently after January of 2017.  In other words, once the criminal investigation was underway.      And are these meetings being held on an ad hoc basis do you go back to your normal duties and meet occasionally and conduct investigations occasionally or are you conducting the investigations in relation to these, this criminal investigation on a fulltime basis?    Now before the criminal – going back now to December of 16.Before the criminal investigation was commenced you would have had a meeting, if I recall correctly, you would have had a meeting with General Phahlane and – wait just bear with me, withGeneral Phahlane and Colonel Dawood roundabout the 21 s t of December.  Is that correct?       If you – just turn with me to bundle LEA23.  So before we go to this report did you at any stage meet with General Phahlane at Sun City or in the Sun City region?      You cannot recall.     So there was awards that were being handed out at Sun City?     And you would have met him atthat…[intervenes]     Very well.  Now ultimately the reason this investigation was against Sarah-Jane Trent and Mr O’Sullivan what came of the criminal investigation?     Thank you Mr Chair.      Thank you Chair.  What was General Mabula role in respect of these investigations.  Do I understand correctly that General Mabula was not himself involved in the investigations he was just a team leader?       And you would report – you as the members of the team would report to him.      We getting to the arrest of Miss Sarah Trent on the 10 t h and I am not really concerned about the warrant of arrest for her.  What is the – at this point – what is the purpose of seizing her cellphone at that stage?     Okay.  Now at that stage you did not apply for a warrant or for a subpoena in respect of the content of the phone or to detain or to seize the phone.  Is that correct?       Okay so you say in Section 23 let me just understand it says that on arrest of any person, the person making the arrest - if he is a person say if he is a peace officer search the person arrested and seize any articles referred to in Section 20 which is found in the possession of or in the custody of or under the control ofthe person arrested.  And there such peace officer is not a police official he shall forfeit deliver any such article to a police official and if he is not a peace officer but you would have been a peace officer.  So the second portion does apply to you.      Okay.  Now if I recall correctly at the time that she was arrested when the arrest took place at the premises of Mr O’Sullivan’s business.  Is that correct?      And that took place at approximately     And then you reconvened at the Shell garage long Marlboro Drive is that correct?    And at that stage you realised that she did not have a cellphone with her.       So I am trying to understand once you realised that she did not have her cellphone on her how did you then get the cellphone and why?      Okay I would like you to go back to LEA80 at page 14.  Now this of course is the statement that you said that you had placed it in support of the warrant of arrest.      Just take us through this any portion of the statement where it shows in this statement that she had used the cellphone in the commission of the crime of impersonating an IPID official.  You have got a number of statements there are facts in support of the application. You have the statement of Mr Emmanuel Shekuve[?] on paragraph 7.        But you say that there was – so there is nothing in this statement to show that she had used the cellphone for the purpose of committing the crime.  Turn to page 19 Sir.       Now there you mention the cellphone of Miss Trent, you give the ID number and the cell number of the phone that was used.       It is at the bottom of the 23 r d of November 2016 one of the witnesses namely Mr Jooste received a call from Paul O’Sullivan who requested a witness to provide him with a number plate as well as photographs of all the vehicles of General Phahlane.           The witness also received a number of text messages via WhatsApp from mobile number 0848491, blah, blah.  One of the messages on the same day as the call requested that the details of the number plates be forwarded to WhatsApp, sorry via WhatsApp.     Is that what you referring to?  BRIGADIER     What I am trying to understand is in as far as impersonation of an IPID official is concerned.  What is it in that statement that you have obtained and I understand it to be the statement that you have obtained from Mr Jooste.  What is it in that statement that suggests that this cellphone could be utilised for investigation or assist in an investigation of the crime of impersonating of an IPID official?  That is the question.           Okay.      Now you did not apply for a warrant for the cellphone?       And you did not apply subsequently for a warrant for the cellphone after you had already detained it?     If I understand correctly, well help me out I know that you seized it during the course of the arrest but was there any other reason why you did not apply for a warrant at the time that you applied for a warrant of herarrest?        Thank you Chair.      Thank you Mr Chair.  You are obviously familiar with some of the allegations that have been made against you about your involvement in this team.       Now just in relation to the allegations that you have heard against you and of course the allegations that you were involved not only in this team specially in relation to the investigation of IPID into General Phahlane but that you have also been involved at an earlier stage in the investigation into General Booysenin respect of the Cato Manor, those ones.       Now in relation to the investigation in respect of the IPID officials that was conducted by your team.  What happened to that investigation?     Okay so the – so the – all the investigations involved the IPID officials and Ms O’Sullivan –sorry Ms Trent and Mr O’Sullivan and that case was struck off the role.    Thank you Mr Chair.  Now after the – after the investigation was at an advanced stage there was an investigation that was conducted by IPID as well into the investigation or rather into some of the things that had been done by the members of your team, is that correct?   And statements were taken from – from you and from other members of – of your team?    Now the allegations in respect of – or thepurpose of that investigation as I understand it was to investigate the question of whether the investigation conducted by your team was designed to undermine the investigation by IPID into General Phahlane?    Okay.  Now I would like to take the – takeyou to a page - if you would turn with me to LEA23 page 71.      LEA23 at page 71.    Now this document says it is WarningStatement for Brigadier Daniel Pharasa Ncube and it is signed on page – if you turn to page 74 – it is signed on the 11 December of 2017.  Is that your signature at the foot of the page?    Now in this statement you explain at paragraph 3 on page 72 you explained that  “On the 30 November 2016 I was approached by Major General Jan Mabula as my senior appointed as a member of the investigatingteam of which he was the lead investigator to conduct an investigation into a security breach against the then action – but I imagine it was meant to be acting National Commissioner of the South African Police Service Lieutenant General Phahlane.  You say as a result hereof presumably as a result of being approached to conduct that investigation I with other members of the investigating team led by General Mabulareceived a briefing at Crime Intelligence Pretoria and they conducted an investigation registered under a Potchefstroom inquiry.  The investigation showed that there had been criminal offences committed by Mr PaulO’Sullivan and Ms Trent and as a result thereof General Mabula as complainant registered a complaint at Kameelsdrift under reference number Kameelsdrift CAS 12/1/2016.I was allocated to do the investigation in this matter and for purposes there are witness statements had been obtained at the Sable Hill Estate when General Phahlane was residing.” Now in the statement if I understand correctly this particularstatement was prepared with the assistance of your attorneys, is that correct?    You then – you then go on to say at paragraph five  “The investigation revealed that and you set out what the investigation unearthed. 5.2 The investigation further revealed that the security manager was asked by Mr O’Sullivan and you set that out.  In5.3 You say after the completion of the investigation the case docket was placed before designated Advocate Mashuga who decided that Mr O’Sullivan and Trent be charged with intimidation in contravening theIPID Act.  You say that a J50 Warrant of Arrest was issued against the two namely Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent both were arrested and brought before the court.” And you continue.  In the statement you do not talk about a meeting that took place on the 30 November 2016 with Advocate Mzinyathi.  I just want to understand why that was left out.    The allegation against you what did you understand at that stage to be the allegation against you?    And what did you understand was being alleged that you had done to defeat the ends of justice?    Well specifically what was being said is that this entire investigation was simply a concoction.  It had simply been fabricated in order to justify undermining the investigation that had been conducted by IPID into General Phahlane.BRIGADIER    No I understand that.  Sorry that is – I am not saying that you – you have done that.  What I am saying to you at this point in time is that your understanding was that IPID was investigating a charge against you of defeating the ends of justice.  So I asked you what is that –what did you understand was being alleged by IPID that you had done to defeat the ends of justice and you said you could not understand the specific details so now I am providing you with those specific details.  What IPID was saying is that you had defeated the ends of justice you and your team had defeated the ends of justice by conducting an investigation which had been fabricated because there was no true basis for the investigation but you had conducted the investigation in order to undermine the investigation that had been conducted against General Phahlane.  That is what wasbeing alleged.    Oh did – you do not understand that to be the allegation.  I am not – I am not asking you if that is – if it is true that that was so I am asking if it is true that youunderstood that to be the charges against you?    Okay.  So in paragraph 5.6 you say the following on the following page at page 74. “At no stage during the investigation of this matter did I influence any witnesses to giveany contradicting statement at – to IPID investigations nor interfere with the investigation of IPID conducted against Lieutenant General Phahlane.”    So it is clear that your own understanding was that the allegation being made against you whether it is true or not is a separate issue.  But your understanding was that the allegation being made against you was that you had somehow influenced witnesses to give contradictorystatements to IPID investigators and that you had somehow interfered in the investigation of IPID against Lieutenant General Phahlane.    Now it would have seemed to me and help me in this respect.  But it would have seemed to me that one of the very important or crucial aspects of your defence that was being prepared over here in the statement with the assistance of your attorneys was to say but actually we were quite alive to the possibility that it may be alleged that we were – to undermine an IPID investigation and for that reason right at the beginning on the 30 November we actually went to meet with Advocate Mzinyathi.    And I understand that you saying that.  What I am asking you is why does that statement – that allegation – that very important fact which is part of your defence why does it not appear in your statement? BRIGADIER    Thank you Mr Chair.      Thank you Mr Chair.   My apologies.  The next witness is Major General Nthebo Jan Mabula.  I will ask that he be sworn in Mr Chair.    Retired major general?    Very well.  Now Major General, you have been implicated in these proceedings and you have come to testify in relation to... on the evidence that has been led against you.   Mr Chair, if I may?  I am told that the transcribers had difficulty hearing the oath been taken.  If it can be administered for a second time?   Thank you, Mr Chair.    I have been told that it is customary that when referring to a major general or a lieutenant general to simple use the title general in a spoken form.  Is that correct?    So for the balance of this evidence I will refer to you as General Mabula.  Is that fine?    Now in these proceedings you have been implicated by a General Booysen and then by a Mr Robert McBride.  Is that correct?    And you have given statements dealing with both sets of allegations made by these two individuals?    If you will go with me to Bundle LE26?    And if you would turn to page 4.  It is typed that bundle.    Top left-hand corner.      The black... if you look at this top left-hand corner sir.    Anyone.  Can you see the top left-hand corner of that document?    Now there is a number that is in black.    It has got LEA.    Batch 26.  And then it has got a number.    Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now if you hold that page open and you turn with me to page 34 of the same document.    You will see there on page 34 ...[intervenes]     Ja, page 34.  There is the signature of the Commissioner of Oaths and on the preceding page, on page 33 is a signature at the top of the page.    Whose signature is that?   And is this the statement that you gave in relation to the allegations made by Mr McBride.    Well, let us be certain.  If you would turn with me to page 5 of that document.    And if you look at paragraph 1.2.    You need that.  You have got 1.1.1. and    Now you have also given another statement and if you would put that bundle aside for just a moment and turn with me to page LEA26.   Sorry, you have got to put that bundle aside.  Look on the spine, you will see that there is a bundle that is marked LEA26.  Sorry, on the spine sir.    Is that 26?    Okay.  Then turn to page 126.  Have you got it?    Okay.  Now if you hold that page and turn with me to page 141 of the same document.    And is that your signature in the top half of that page under the words, this done and signed at this 22day of May 2019?    And is this your statement that is made in response to the allegations made by General Booysen?    And do you confirm that both these statements, the one who was made in relation to Mr McBride and the one made in relation to General Booysen?  You confirm that they are true and correct?    I would like to deal first with the allegations that have been in the affidavit that you have filed in response to Mr McBride’s statement.    So I want you to go back, in other words,to LEA26 at page 4.    Now you say... if you will turn with me then to page 8 of that document.    You have outlined over here your history, your career history and you deal with the last items and you say that from the 1s t of March of 10 to the 1s t  of November of 2016, you were the Provincial Head, Director for Priority Crime Investigations by the HAWKS inthe North West.  Is that correct?    Now in relation to the allegations that have been made by Mr McBride which relates to a team that you were pointed to head-up in respect of a security threatat the home of Acting National Commissioner Phahlane.    And that took place during the period that you were the Deputy Provincial Commissioner Crime Detection.  Is that correct?   Now can you explain to us how your appointment to that team came about?    So when you say you were called in the provincial commissioner, who are you referring to now?    You said you were called in by the provincial commissioner.    For the North West.  Who were you referring to?    What is the name of the person that youare talking about?    Okay.    And you said that she phoned you in the early morning.    And on what day... what was the date ofthis... was it a telephone call or were you summonsed by somebody else?    I see.    So you then had a meeting now on the same day with General Motswenyane.  Is that correct?    Okay.  And then she explained to you that there was a security breach in respect of the Acting National Commissioner’s private residence.  Is that correct?    Okay.    And what did she want you to do now that she is informing you of this?    So the request was specifically from the Acting Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence for you to avail yourself?    So in other words, the Acting Divisional Commissioner had specifically request you, General Mabula?   Sure.  But it was your ...[intervenes]     Sorry.  But it was your understanding that you had been requested specifically by the Acting Divisional Commissioner?    Okay.  Then insofar as the team was concerned that was to assist you in this task ...[intervenes]     ...were you to appoint the team or was the Provincial Commissioner, General Motswenyane, did she indicate what the team or who the members of the team would be?   Very well.  You, obviously... either you would have availed you at the time or you obviously required as to where the residence of the Acting National Commissioner was at that point in time.    Now it was only in Pretoria.   So she had told you that much that it was in Pretoria.    Did you acquire why it is that you had been appointed to investigate a matter that related to a security breach that took place in a different province?    Pardon?  Say that again.   Okay.    The question Mr Chair was whether hehad made an enquiry from the Provincial Commissioner as to why he who was placed in the North West was being asked to go and investigate a security breach that took place in a different province.    And is that in relation to all types of investigations or certain types of investigations where that is normal practise?    Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Chair.  So this particular conversation that you had with the Provincial Commissioner, do you recall the date on which that conversation took place?   Now the Provincial Commissioner requested you to assemble a team and then to go about conducting an investigation.  Is that correct?    Okay.  Now I think the term that was used previously was that there would be a briefing session.    Now the meeting with the Provincial Commissioner Motswenyane, after that meeting had been completed, in other words, you have finished with the meeting and you understand what your instruction is, did you on the same day assemble the team and the travel off to Crime Intelligence?    How did you select the members of the team?  What criteria did you use?    Is that Lieutenant Colonel Makhele?    And why did you select him?    And when you say that you were dealing with legal issues, what legal issues are we referring to now?    Okay.    So you then having assembled the team, you then travelled up to Pretoria where you meet with the Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence.  Is thatcorrect?    And this is the briefing session that we speak of?    What transpires?  What is told you in this briefing session?    And what else was told to you.    Yes, I want to understand what... not obviously verbatim but in terms of the substance what was conveyed to you at that meeting.    And the assessment is that there is athreat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner.    Now who was present in this meeting from you and your team’s side and on the side of Crime Intelligence?    H’m?   So there were three people.  Could there have been more people?  I am trying to adduce.    Okay.    So we know that Moyane, it is clear.  We know that... is it General Makhele?   and then who is the third person, colonel?    Do you know how to spell that?  I am trying to catch the name.    Oh, BM?   Okay so that is... is it his or her initials?    [laughs]  Now you say that they had reported that there was a security assessment that had been done by them.  Presumable when you say by them it wouldhave been done by Crime Intelligence.    And the security assessment determined that there was a security risk or a threat to the life of the Acting National Commissioner.  Is that correct?   Were there any documents that were produced?    And who was the person... who were the persons or people... sorry.  Who was the person or people that were speaking on behalf of Crime Intelligence that were speaking?    Okay.  So all the information that had been transmitted to you or that had been conveyed to you at that meeting had been conveyed specifically by Moyane, Brigadier Moyane?    And the date of the meeting, do you recall that?   Now the document or the... or in terms of the report that was been conveyed to you about the security threats that had been done by the Crime Intelligence, did they indicate whether there was a written document to that affect or whether he indicated that it was simple a verbal assessment that had been given to them?    Okay.      And were you ever presented with a document at all?    Now in terms of the briefing that have been given to you, did they tell you who is it that you had to investigate, what the nature of the complaint was or theconcern was?  Were you able to take down notes to make a summary for the full detailed explanation of what it is that you were going to investigate?    And did they suggest that the threateningemails and that the vehicle that had gone through the residence was somehow connected with each other?    Did they identify everybody that you needed to investigate?    Oh, I see.      Now in terms of the report that had been given to you in that briefing session, had they indicated to you other than Paul O’Sullivan you mentioned that there was a white male, there was a white lady.  Other than the two of them, who else was involved?  Do they suggest thatthere was anybody else that you had to investigate?     Okay.  And this is now on the 30 t h.  What do you do – you have the briefing session, you presumably decide what it is that you are going to do about this.     You make that decision together withCrime Intelligence or do you and your team go and retire elsewhere and decide how you are going to deal with the situation?     And what is it that you decided?     Now just to understand.  Firstly, when you talk about the DPP, who are you referring to?     Mzinyathi, okay.     I see.     Why were you going to see him at all?  I am not sure if I am following that.     Yes.       Why I am asking this question because I understood that you do not know who – other than the two, Paul O’Sullivan and the white lady, you know that there were two black gentlemen in the vehicle but you do not know who they are.  So I am trying to understand how you know that IPID is involved in this matter at all?     I am not following that.  You are saying this is in the public domain?    That IPID was investigating the Acting National Commissioner?     In the media?     And you are saying that according to the media reports that you were familiar with youunderstood that Paul O’Sullivan had been investigating the Acting National Commissioner and you – do I misunderstand that? MAJOR GENERAL     And was that investigation that you understood then Paul O’Sullivan’s name was mentioned, but you understand that from the media reports to be aninvestigation being conducted by IPID?     No …[intervenes]    Sorry, listen to my question.  I am trying to understand on what basis you decided to go and see the DPP.  Now you say it was because you were concerned about possibly interfering in an IPID investigation?     I understood from your earlier responses that you did not know other than Paul O’Sullivan and the white lady, you did not know who was involved ingoing to the Acting National Commissioner’s residence.   So pursuant to that I am asking you on what basis did you go up to IPID?  And if I understand your response correctly you are saying it is because you understood that there was a relationship between Paul O’Sullivan and IPID.  Now I am asking you is that based upon the media reports that you speak of?     And then you decided you were going to go and first see whether – you are going to first go and see the DPP about this issue.  Did you investigate at thatstage before you went and go and see the DPP?  Did you investigate whether Paul O’Sullivan was indeed a member of IPID?     So when you say that you are going to go and see the DPP to see whether they are aware of the investigation are you referring to the investigation that wasbeing conducted by IPID into the Acting National Commissioner? MAJOR GENERAL     Okay.    Now after you went to go and see the DPP what was the assessment that was made over there about the future conduct of your team’s investigation?     You went to go and see the DPP.     You met with Advocate Mzinyathi.     After that meeting or in the meeting was it decided how you were to proceed with this matter?     Now moving forward, you would have met with your team afterwards presumably.  You have already met with Mzinyathi – sorry, Advocate Mzinyathi, you go back presumably either to North West or elsewhereto discuss the way forward and how the different tasks are going to be divided between your team members, is that correct?     And when did that meeting take place?     Now why would Crime Intelligence be involved in the security assessment?  Are you aware of that?     Why had Crime Intelligence conducted the security assessment in the first place?     Is that typical, is that usual, is it appropriate for Crime Intelligence to be involved?     Okay.     You then decided, that is the members of you team, would start with the investigation immediately, is that correct?     You, as the team leader, what would your role be insofar as the investigation and the future of the investigation was concerned?     And were you to return to North West where you were based or were you going to be moving in and out from your base in North West and coming up to Gauteng from time to time?     And you – those context where you would interact with the Acting National Commissioner would it be in formal settings?  In other words, would you meet at the residence of the Acting National Commissioner or would you meet at an official SAPS site?     And now take us through the investigation that have conducted.  You obviously receiving statements from time to time and presumably, as the team leader, you are not actually conducting any investigationsyourself, your sole purpose is to lead the team and you would receive statements or reports in some form either verbal reports or written reports, is that correct?     And all the reports that were being sent – were being given to you, would they be verbal reports only or would also be written reports, other than statements now?     You are also having access to the..?     Okay.     At the early stage, in other words still in 2016 now when the investigation starts, the role that you played as the team leader is to receive the reports and to receive …(intervenes)     Pardon me, Mr Chair.  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Your role is to receive reports and to receive the statements and then you have got to make decisions presumably based on what you are reading and the reports that are being given to you.  Would that be fair?    No, no, my question is, do you have to make decisions based upon what you have read in the statements and the verbal communications?     And what decisions do you take as a result of the information that has been supplied to you, either in the form of the statements or the verbal reports?     And this particular investigation you are obviously the team leader but you yourself had toreport to somebody else, you fall under somebody else’s jurisdiction.     In this case you fall under the Provincial Commissioner.    It is [indistinct]  jurisdiction.     Are you reporting to her on this matter or are you reporting to somebody else?     And who is that?     Okay, so this particular investigation resides under the Acting Divisional Commissioner, so you are reporting to her.     So all the reports that have been given to you, you communicate those reports to her.     Now at the – by the time you have started doing these investigations is there an agreement that you would report to her in writing or simply verbally?    So in your statement you have attached – marked NJN1, it appears at LEA26, that is bundle LEA26, at page 35.    It is the one that we are using, MrChair.     Now this particular document at page 35, can you tell us what this document is, where did you get this document from?     What is this document and where did you get it from?     So the Provincial Commissioner’s office gave it to you but you understand that it came from the Acting Divisional Commissioner?       So when you went to this briefing session with the Acting Divisional Commissioner did you take this document with you or did you receive this document afterwards?     And the purpose of this document, if Iunderstand correctly, is as the heading indicates that it is a mandate.     In other words, this is the document that has empowered you to conduct the investigation that you were conducting.     It says here under the first item,     Now I just want to understand firstly, this date over here of the 16 October 16, what investigation has been conducted over here?  What are they referring to?  Is this the incident with Mr Paul O’Sullivan?     And this particular vehicle that you spoke to, does this vehicle – this incident with the vehicle, does that relate to Mr Paul O’Sullivan or are we talking about two different incidents?     Okay.     And the information about thescreening by which I understand you to mean that you had done a check on the registration number?     So when they did – when they gave you information about the screening at the briefingsession, they already knew that that vehicle belonged to Mr Paul O’Sullivan, is that correct?     Okay.  And then you get this letter which is sent to you after the event.  In other words, after you have returned from Crime Intelligence where the briefing was held.     And in this letter they are saying to     And they say that    So I am just trying to understand why they would say it was unknown individuals when in the briefing session they have already told you that the peoplewere Paul O’Sullivan and a white female, two black males, why are they saying in this letter that it is unknown individuals?     I would like to know, yes.     Thank you, Mr Chair.     I will keep eye on the…     Thank you, Mr Chair.     Probably another hour, Mr Chair.       Thank you, Mr Chair.     Thank you, Mr Chair.  So there it says     Then paragraph 3, the objective of the investigation;“the attorneys requested to conduct an investigation and to obtain all necessary statements from witnesses, collect evidence regarding – sorry and to collect evidence regarding threat against the Acting National Commissioner.”On the following page; “The investigation will commence on 30 November 16 and will continue for a period of two months with a possibility of further extension”. Was a further extension granted after a two-month period?     No, no, I’m asking – so there was an extension granted?     Who granted the extension?     And sorry what did you [indistinct] she?     Okay and you say all resources will be provided by the North West Province, in other words yourProvince will be responsible for all the resources that are provided to this investigation.   “The investigation team will report all  progress concerning the investigation to the actingDivisional Commissioner Crime Intelligence and meetings will be conducted at the request of the team leader”,  Is that correct?     Now, other than verbal reports you say that there were no written reports that were ever given and there was never a recommendation given.     Was a recommendation given to anybody?     To whom was the recommendation given to?     I asked you, other than the written reports – sorry other than the verbal reports was there a recommendation that had been given to anybody – sorry to the Divisional Commissioner, pardon me, I said was there arecommendation that was given and I understood your previous answer to be, no there was no recommendation given.  Now, you’ve now made a qualification on that, you said not to the Divisional Commissioner then my next question is, did you give such a recommendation toanybody? MAJOR GENERAL     And were those written reports?     Okay, now the mandate that had been given to you here by the acting Divisional Commissioner, was this mandate ever extended or broadened?     So, all the investigations that werebeing conducted by you and your team were conducted pursuant to this mandate?     What – there were, of course, subsequently, I think it was on the 4 t h of January, youopened a case docket through Kameeldrift Police Station, is that right?     And that was on the 4 t h of January of 17.  Has there ever been a criminal case that has been opened relating to a threat on the life of the acting National Commissioner? MAJOR GENERAL     So, I take it that your answer to my question is, no, there was never any criminal investigation or criminal charges that were instituted relating to a threat to the life of the acting National Commissioner?     So, you say that there was a charge of intimidation…[intervenes].    Under which case docket was that?    The acting National Commissioner. MAJOR GENERAL     The threat against the acting National Commissioner, so not the – the charges are not against the acting National Commissioner.  Were there any chargesthat were laid, against anybody, in respect of the intimidation against the acting National Commissioner?     Now the charges were brought,obviously against Mr Paul O’Sullivan, is that right?     And there were charges that were brought against Ms Trent.     Later on, there were charges that were brought against two IPID officials.     Now, what I’m asking you is, of all those charges that were brought against the differentpeople, Ms Trent, Mr O’Sullivan and the two IPID officials, which charge related to intimidation by any of them of the acting National Commissioner, which one of them had intimidated the acting National Commissioner?     So, you’re saying that Mr Paul O’Sullivan, one of these charges relates to his intimidation of the acting National Commissioner?     Now, these other charges that hadbeen brought, there were charges of fraud, there were charges of impersonation of an IPID official, there were subsequently charges that had been brought of racketeering, charges relating to the national investigations relating to the National Credit Act, breaches of the National Credit Act, all those charges, how did that relate to the mandate that you had been given?     Now, according to a certain Mr – if you will turn with me to Bundle LEA23, if you will turn with me to page 42.1.    Yes, that’s right, page 42.     Page 42 Bundle LEA23, if you would go to page 42.     Now this is a statement – sorry 42, now if you will turn to the following page, to page 42.1.     Pardon me – there must be a page42.1 in that Bundle, are you looking at the top left-hand corner?     Mr Chair, my junior can just assist.  Thank you, Mr Chair, my apologies for that, do you have the document sir?     Now, this is a statement of a – that was taken from a person named Stefanus Hermanus Heiner [spelt into record] and it’s dated the 25 t h of July of 2017and I want to read to you what he says, he says that on the 30 t h of November, starting at the top paragraph, “I received a telephonic instruction from Brigadier Moyane to instruct Lieutenant Colonel Hennie Kruger and Captain Coetzee to investigate asecurity breach at the complex where Lieutenant General Phahlane stays. He indicated to me that O’Sullivan and others went to the complex where Lieutenant General Phahlane stays and asked questions relating to his house and security arrangements.  I was informed the same day that it was confirmed that it was O’Sullivan together with IPID members visited the place and asked various questions related to Lieutenant General Phahlane.  I phoned Brigadier Moyane then the early eveningon the 30 t h of November 2017 and informed him of our finding and forwarded a written report to him on 1 December 2017.  I do not know about the briefing session the investigation team was having at Crime Intelligence and was not part of it.  I did not work with the team, I did not supply any information to them.  I have never attended any meeting at the office of Lieutenant General Phahlane regarding this investigation and did not report to him on any of our findings.  With the investigation, no securitybreach was found and instead it was found that O’Sullivan was with IPID investigation at the complex to investigate allegations against Lieutenant General Phahlane”,Now, assuming this to be correct, when you metwith Brigadier Moyane, he communicated the exact opposite and said that a finding had been made or an assessment had been made that there was a security breach, is that correct?   So, if I understand that, you say, correctly that – either this statement is incorrect or his statement is incorrect.     Now subsequently, if you’ll just bear with me, there was a statement that was taken from you in a criminal investigation that had been – or was being conducted by IPID, is that correct?     And you gave a statement in those proceedings, is that correct?    When was the statement given?      Your statement was given on the 11 t h of December of 2017.    Now in the statement, and I’d like you to turn with me to Bundle LEA23 and I’d like you to turn to page 59.     That’s correct and will you turn to page – hold that page open and turn to page 66.     Ja hold the page 59 open with your left hand, keep your left hand there and then turn to page 66,is that...     Is that your signature?     Okay, and if you go back to page 59 it says that this is the warning statement of Ntebo Jan Mabula.     Is this the statement that you gave to IPID?    Now this statement was given to IPID after you had been – after you had, had an opportunity to consult with your attorneys, is that correct?     You say, on page 60 at paragraph 5.1.     That’s correct.     You see paragraph 5.1 at the bottom of the page?     That’s right.     Page 60 top left-hand corner. MAJOR GENERAL     Bottom of the page.     You’ll see that there’s paragraph 5 and then below paragraph 5, there’s a 5.1, you see that?     I think the bundle next to you is Bundle LEA23.    It’s Bundle LEA23.     23 Mr Chair.    I thought it was but I think the witness has moved it to the side.     Oh, my apologies.     That’s correct.   That is correct Mr Chair.      At the bottom of that page, paragraph 5.1, you see that?     You say, “I became aware thereof since my involvement inthis matter at the end of November 2016 that Crime Intelligence conducted a security breach investigation around November 2016 on the former acting National Commissioner of SAPS, Lieutenant General Phahlane”,On the following page, you say, “I also became aware thereof since my involvement, that as a result of the investigation by Crime Intelligence a report was submitted under reference CSI Inquiry 2/10/16, in this report it was conveyed     Now what is this quote been taken from, where did you get this information?     And according to this, you’re saying that the report that – according to the statement, this report which is quoted verbatim, indicates that there was a serious threat against the life of the acting National Commissioner, correct?     Oh, well it says, rather, the breach of the security of the acting National Commissioner and it’s signed by Mr Heiner, you see that, according to this quote?     And you never have provided the Commission with this document, in other words the report that you’re referring to over here, you never provided it to this Commission.    What we’re trying to understand is, where is this report, everybody is searching for this report and I certainly haven’t seen it and I understand that – it may not be for your account, but I understand that it can’t be located and yet you obviously had it, according to what you’ve said in your statement.     The question is…[intervenes].     61 Mr Chair.     Page 62 refers to something different.     Thank you Mr Chair.  Now, putting that issue aside, just temporarily, that Mr Heiner that you’re referring to over there seems to be the same person who’sstatement I read out to you a moment ago, who, in fact, says the opposite.     Are you, now, given what you’ve already quoted, are you in a position to assist us as to how Mr Heiner is saying something which is the exact opposite to what you have, in a previous statement indicated that you had a report which said something which is exactly the opposite of what Mr Heiner is saying?    Thank you Mr Chair.      I still have to deal with the – the issue relating to General Booysen.    But I need to round up some of the issues relating to this.    Thank you Mr Chair.    I think the evidence relating to General Booysen that would go a lot quicker.  The – this evidence …    Probably about…    Between half an hour.    Thank you Mr Chair.    No indeed not.  I would like to finalise just this section probably only about another ten or fifteen minutes relating to this section and then I will get onto General Booysen.    Probably about forty minutes or so.   Thank you Mr Chair.    Thank you Chair.    It may well be Mr Chair.    Shall be play it by ear?  About to five or ten minutes.    Thank you, Mr Chair.   Booysen.    Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now, according to – and we have a report that is in Bundle LEA23 at page 236 – according to the analyses of the cell phone records.     Page 236, LEA23.    Sorry, let me just it understand it.  You extracted it from ...[intervenes]     But where was the document?  How did he come in possession of the document.    Okay?    I see.    Okay.   So when you consulted with Advocate Joubert, not the present Advocate Joubert, you... he would have had access to the document.    Because other people were in that meeting.   Also had access.  So who ...[intervenes]     Sorry.    But you yourself did not see the document?    Okay.    Now that... who were the other people that you were within that meeting?    Who?    So General Makhele was present in that meeting?    And who produced the report?   Very well.  Was General Makhele present in that meeting as well?   You see, in her statement – if you will turn with me to page 65.    Sorry, this is Bundle LEA23, by the way.    Five, six Mr Chair.    She, other than to talk, in terms about the fact of the report, are the security breaches assessment that have been obtained.  She does not refer to the content of that report.  Are you able to comment on that?    Sorry.  If you look at page 56.  Let me just try and find it first.  Page 56 to 58 is the statement of Major General M Agnes Makhele.  Do you see that?    Now if you turn to paragraph P at that   And I am asking you, if you are in aposition to comment on it?  You had never seen that report before this meeting, according to your testimony.    Makhele would have received that report.  Moyane ought to have receive that report and yet neither one of them... Makhele does not refer to the report and Moyane does not... sorry, does not quote the report.    It seems to be it is the same reportbecause this is the security breach assessment that has been conducted, she says, by Counter and Security Intelligence Crime Intelligence.    So she is referring to the same report.   The point I am making is that there is no... the two people that one would expected to produce the report and to refer to it, two people who had previously apparently had sight of the report, they do not refer to that report in their... they do not quote the report in their statements.    Well, I am asking him if he is able toassist us on that because ...[indistinct]     Well, taken a stand.  Why ...[intervenes]     But I am trying to understand why it was decided specifically for him to quote the report who hasnever seen the report before that day, when the two people who had seen the report, their statements ...[intervenes]     Well, it was part of the decision that was taken in the consultation.  I just want to understand from him why he is...[intervenes]     Thank you, Mr Chair.  With regards to the attorney that represented you in this matter, who was theattorney who represented you at this stage?    Ja, I know he is the advocate.  Who is the attorney?  Did you have an attorney?    Oh, I see.    In terms of obtaining the statement.  Sorry, the... that particular report Mr Chair.  That is the only thing I am concerned with.    If we can just move onto an additional point relating to your movement on the 27t h of November of 16.    Not as... I just want to finalise the question about his movement on the 27 t h of November.    Thank you, Mr Chair.   Sorry, Mr Chair I did not catch that.    Thank you, Mr Chair.  Yes, if you would turn with me to LEA23 at page 236.    236.   Correct, Mr Chair.    236.    Now this is a report that is compiled based on the cell phone records of several people including you and General Phahlane amongst others.  What I would like to... according to the report which was part of the docket in CAS I34/05/2015.  You would have in... you would have on the Sunday the 27t h of November of 2016, you would have travelled up to Pretoria to meet with General Phahlane.  Is that correct?    Well, this would have been the daybefore or few days before you had been appointed to conduct this investigation.    Now if we could turn to page 238.    At the foot of the page you will see there,it says on Sunday, the 27t h of November and says as per data section of ...[indistinct] of 783169.  Now that data relates to your... the movement on your side.    And then on the following page, page239, it itemises ...[intervenes]     239.  It itemises all the transactions that took place on your phone until the following page at page 240.    Now it shows that you received a call    Ja, is that correct?    Where do you stay?    Well, Mr Chair it shows that the witness would have met with General Phahlane a day before the actual meeting the... sorry, a few days before he wasappointed to the team.  So we would like to know what the purpose of that meeting was.    Well, we want to establish whether the... he was, in fact, in that meeting, was the purpose of the meeting to confirm ...[intervenes]     Well, we want to establish whether hewas in fact appointed because as the records that show on the Sunday, in other words, three days before he was appointed to team, did he actually meet with the general and was the purpose of that meeting to appoint him to the team. That is what we would like to establish.      Okay.  Now in relation to General Booysen.  If we can move onto his ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now General Booysen, you went to Kwazulu-Natal to investigate allegations relate – or to conduct an investigation into the Cato Manor hit squads, is that correct?     Who was part of that team that accompanied you to conduct that investigation?    Yes.     What – in the investigations that you had conducted and with reference to what you have said in your statement and I am going to try not to go through your statement, given the time limitations, but what did the investigations establish from your perspective, into the death squad, that is, in the Cato Manor case?     Sure.     The evidence that you have given now– sorry, I am just struggling to find it in your statement.  Where did you put all of that about your – the fact that you requested – where in your statement do you deal with the fact that you had requested Advocate Mlotshwa who was dealing with the Cato Manor case?    Ja.       Where do you deal with the fact that you were the one that had a discussion with him and he then suggested to you that you should speak to the National Director of Public Prosecutions because everybody in Kwazulu-Natal was afraid?  Where is that in your statement?     So when you then met with Advocate Jiba in Johannesburg was at that stage …[intervenes]     Sorry, at Pretoria, who at that stage was the Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions, correct?    You wanted a dedicated Prosecutor to be appointed to deal with the Cato Manor investigation.     Okay.     So now based on the presentation that you had given – and I take it that it was you, it was Angus and it was who else at this presentation?     Just you.     So it is you and Angus.     And from the – who was from IPID and Advocate Jiba and who is the other advocate?     Mosini?     Okay.  Now she asks you, that is Adv Jiba now, asks you, who do you have in mind?  Now when she asks that question, what is she referring to, have in mind to do what?     Okay.     And you mention one person.     And she ultimately, she says she thinks six people should – six advocates should …[intervenes]     Okay.  Now as the investigation unfolded, you would have been party to …[intervenes]     Now the investigation team would have started obtaining statements from various witnesses, is that correct?     And you were overseeing thatinvestigation team from the DPCI’s side.     Those statements would then be presented to the various advocates for their assessment.     Would you collect the statements yourself?  In other words, go and take statements from witnesses and submit them or were you simply overseeing the statements and receiving themfrom the other investigators?     And you would have considered all those statements that were submitted is that correct?     I see.     So between the team they came to the conclusion that a criminal case should be instituted against various members of the Cato Manor “hit squad” but including General Booysen, is that correct?    Okay, at what stage did you say …[intervenes]     At what stage did you decide and byyou I mean, you as the team, to institute criminal prosecution against General Booysen?     Well, were you not part …[intervenes]    Thank you, Mr Chair.  At some stage a decision was obviously taken to charge General Booysen.     Now the question that I am reallyasking you, is there would have presumably been a discussion about that whether we had enough, you would have interacted, do we need more information?   The prosecutors would presumably have requested additional information if they were unhappy with the information that was already in existence.  They might have sent you back to go and get further statements if they felt that were certain things that the witnesses had given were unclear, is that correct?     Now you would have been part of that process of deciding – part of the process of either receiving instructions to obtain further information or part of the process of obtaining the further information.     And at some stage a decision was taken that sufficient information was available in order to institute a case against General Booysen.      Now you yourself would not, as a police officer or as a member of the DPCI at the time, you would not have taken that decision yourself but together with the team and specifically the team of prosecutors that were available, would you not have sat and conferred with them about that decision?    Now all the evidence that had been gathered, you had obviously received some of the evidence or presumably all the evidence, you were the head of theinvestigation team, there was the prosecution that had been sent there to assist you.  You must have looked at the evidence and assessed it for yourself.     Yes?    Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now this particular investigation, if I understand correctly, you were part of a team that was conducting specifically an investigation into the Cato Manor hit squads but I do not want to focus on that for time being, I want to focus on General Booysen.     Based on what you are saying now, itseems to me that between the two of you, that is between you and Mr Angus.     You had – you were not necessarily sitting together and taking decisions jointly.Do Iunderstand that correctly?     Well, decisions in relation to the investigation and whether sufficient information has been obtained insofar as the investigation is concerned.     Correct, Mr Chair.     Whether they were taking this jointly.     That is right.  Were you meeting with each other to discuss?     But in terms of what had to be presented obviously between the two of you, you had to make sure that everything was covered.    So the two of you would have sat together to take joint decisions presumably otherwise the risk, there is a real risk that one person will not cover a particular issue. MAJOR GENERAL     And ultimately would you have taken decisions jointly as to whether the investigation iscomplete?     I am going one further step and my question is, did they take a joint decision …[intervenes]     That is had been finalised?     What I am trying to understand is whether there is – not whether they spoke about – not whether they spoke about it but whether as a fact they agreed, that’s my question.  I don’t him to necessarily be saying that.     Correct.    That is correct Mr Chair.    And after that decision or agreement had been reached was there any – anything from the Prosecutor ’s side, to suggest – did they suggest to you that there was additional evidence that were literally gathered?     That is correct Chair.   Now of course you are aware of the fact that the decision to prosecuteGeneral Booysen was ultimately reviewed and set aside by the High Court.     And according to the findings of that Court there was in fact no evidence or – to support the charges against him.    So what I am trying to understand is you obviously having become aware of the fact that there was a High Court order or a High Court judgment whichsaid that there was no evidence, you must have gone back to investigate the question of how the Court had come to such a conclusion given the fact that you had been involved and had taken a decision that there was enough evidence.     Well my understanding is that you were in agreement that the investigation was complete, correct?    Now that being the case what I am trying to understand once the High Court judgment came out the High Court judgment shows that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.     Now from your side once you became aware of that judgment did you go back and see what the shortcomings in the investigation that you had conducted.    Thank you Mr Chair.     Now you ...[intervenes]      Thank you Mr Chair, I am in yourhands.     His arrest and the circumstances of the arrest.     I am saying the arrest and the circumstances of his arrest, I understood that the – when he was arrested there was a specific decision taken that heshould be taken – that Major General Booysen should be paraded past the media.      Well that’s – that was the information by General Booysen.    But whether you were part of the team did you get instructions about how the arrest should be conducted?  That is the question.    Thank you Mr Chair.    Thank you Mr Chair.  The next witness will be called to be cross-examined, he is Mr RobertMcBride.     Thank you Mr Chair that then brings us to the end of today’s’ proceedings.     End of a long day.

Not to date because it is proceed.    Oh.    No Chairperson because when Isigned it I was not – I was no more the Branch Commander but the Provincial Head Commercial Crime North West.    Of Phokeng?    Of Phokeng?    2013 Chairperson I was the Branch Commander of Organised Crime Phokeng.    Chairperson it is incorrect because currently I am the Provincial Head Commercial Crime North West Province.    That is correct Chairperson.    Chairperson I cannot remember but I think it was from 2000 – 2013.   No, no.  I become the Provincial Head Commercial Crime Chairperson of the North Westdetectives.    No.    I think it is 2017 Chairperson.  I am not actually sure but I think it is 2017.    I was stationed at Provincial – as a Provincial Head Commercial Crime Chairperson.  That is why I said the time when I was appointed the year maybe it is before 2017 because when – when we carry out this investigation I was already the Provincial Head Commercial Crime Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    Perhaps can I just ask to be re – your question to be repeated so that I can be able to understand it?    That is correct Chairperson.    Chairperson I – I cannot remember the date but it was during November 2016.    No not yet.    Okay.  I have got it Chairperson.   I see the document Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.    Can the question be repeated Chairperson?    Chairperson my appointment I was contacted maybe before the letter by Major General Mabula to inform me that the former Provincial Commissioner of the North West Lieutenant General Motswenyane havegiven him instruction to formulate investigation team and he has nominated me to be part of that team.    That is correct.    That is correct Chairperson.    No it was before the 30 NovemberChairperson.    I cannot recall the date Chairperson.    No I think it was the end of the week and the next week I think the 30 t h – was the next week.    That is correct Chairperson.    The leader of the team Chairperson was General Mabula.    That is correct and also a threat on the life of the former acting National Commissioner General Phahlane.    No Chairperson as a team?    Ja part of that team that I am in thatteam?    No Chairperson. ADV HULLEY    Chairperson yes.  In terms of General Mabula.    I have – there was a team that he led actually he did not – I must put it – it was a team that investigate Cato Manor cases in KwaZulu Natal I was also called to be part of the team.    No the rest of the members on this they were not – they were not part of that team.  They were not part of the – that Cato Manor team.    Current?    Chairperson I only remember the one of the Cato Manor.    That is correct Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.    It was – actually I was called because there was an operation that was need to take place in terms of effecting arrests.    That is correct Chairperson.    The second arrest Chairperson I cannot remember whether he was warned to appear but I know that there was a second incident that I was also involved but I – I cannot remember exactly whether it was arrest or whether it was a warning for him to appear in court.  But I know there was two occasions.    I will do that.   I see it Chairperson.    Chairperson not part of the team prior.  I was informed before the 30 t h and we commenced on the 30 t h up to the…    That is correct Chairperson.    It was mandated by the acting Divisional Commissioner by then of Crime Intelligence Chairperson Major General Mahele [?].    That was supposed to be approved Chairperson by the Provincial Commissioner North WestLieutenant General Motswenyane.    The first thing that have happened Chairperson Major General Mabula facilitate the meeting with Crime Intelligence with the investigation team.  That is the briefing meeting.  Crime Intelligence briefing theinvestigation team.    That is correct Chairperson.  That is the Crime Intelligence team that investigated the threat assessment against former acting National Commissioner General Phahlane.    I was present Chairperson.   Correct Chairperson.    Chairperson when I – my memory serve me well it was the acting herself Major General Mahele [?], Brigadier Motswenyane.  I cannot remember the other members.  I remember the two.    That is correct, Chairperson.    No, I think there were additional but I cannot remember their names.     That is correct, Chairperson.    Brigadier Motswenyane.  He was the one was briefing the team with regards to the investigation.   No, Chairperson they present to usbut he provide... he provide also copies of emails that they allege it was certain emails that was sent to the former Acting National Commissioner.    Chairperson, the briefing was to the effect that a vehicle, a Ford Kuga, went to Sable Hills where the former Acting National Commissioner stayed and it went to actually the service entrance, trying to enter the estateand it was referred to the main gate.The occupants were four occupants according to the briefing of Crime Intelligence.  There was one white male, one white female and two African males who went into the estate and looking the estate manager.  And...    And when they arrived at the estate manager, they introduced themselves as members from IPID.      Yes ...[intervenes]     Yes, we were informed about this at the briefing session and they went also to the same...actually, they give us how it happened in terms of the visit of these four people to the estate.    Yes, they give us emails that they allege it was threatening emails that they said emails was actually sent by one individual Paul O’Sullivan to the Acting National Commissioner and the email was part of the investigation, the threat investigation.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chairperson    They, according to them, they reachedthat there was a breach of security with related to the former Acting National Commissioner’s life.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Was to conduct investigation in relation to a threat imposed to the life of the former Acting National Commissioner, Chairperson.    Chairperson, we... because we were having the emails and the briefing, we did not open a criminal docket.  We opened an inquiry docket.ADV HULLEY    Chairperson, maybe I must give how ithas happened in terms of this investigation?We ...[intervenes]     That is correct, Chairperson.    That is why Chairperson I said let me explain how did we approach it from that team in that investigation.  The approach... Chairperson, after the briefing of CrimeIntelligence, General Mabula, the lead... the team leader then suggested to us – because during the briefing it was indicated that it is believed that the people who entered the Sable Hills are members of IPID, according to the briefing.And General Mabula indicated to us to say, after thebriefing, let us make an appointment with DPP Pretoria.  He said to us, let us go and brief the DPP regarding this investigation.  The reason being, there was on public domain that IPID is investigating the Acting National Commissioner.So for us to investigate this threat assessment, let us brought the DPP onboard so that our action must not been seen as action countering the investigation of IPID.Then we went and briefed Advocate Mzinyathi.  It was myself and Major General Mabula and Colonel Kgorane.We briefed him in terms of what Crime Intelligence hasbriefed us and also in terms of the email that they allege was the threaten email.And Advocate Mzinyathi indicated to us that to him this is a very serious allegation that need to be investigated and then he indicated to us to say he will allocate an advocate to the team and he divulged the name that time, to say Advocate Nemaorane will be assigned to the team.  It is then that we commenced with the investigation.    Yes, in terms of the investigation.  Chairperson, the Crime Intelligence, they do not have theskills in terms of crime investigation.  That is why there was a team nominated now to investigate in terms of crime investigation.    There was no specific instruction interms of that Chairperson but the... our team leader, General Mabula, he was communicating with General Makhele in terms of giving the feedback, not in writing but verbal feedback in terms of the progress.    If I remember well Chairperson, I think it was the 30t h of November 2016.    Chairperson, I cannot recall.  I think what happened, we had a meeting with Crime Intelligence early in the morning and when, after that meeting, General Mabula conducted Advocate Mzinyathi, allowed us to come and see him at his office on the same day.   No, Chairperson we were already there in terms of the briefing of Crime Intelligence.    That is correct, Chairperson.    We did not have a meeting with him Chairperson because as I said, if... when he contacted me in terms of the instruction of the former provincial head, he    I cannot recall but after the meeting yes we had seen him Chairperson after the meeting withCrime Intelligence but I cannot recall that General Mabula had called a meeting after we met with Crime Intelligence.    No meeting to that effect but myself, Colonel Dawood and Brigadier Kgorane, Chairperson, our duties was of investigators.  Colonel Ready, actually he isfrom legal service.  He was just part of the team in terms of legal opinions.      Chairperson, I would not say it is meeting but we will, from time to time, when we are... we went and obtained statement, we will brief General Mabula as a team. ADV HULLEY    Chairperson, what have happened, as I have said, we registered inquiry, inquiry docket.  It was not a criminal docket.After we... we commenced with investigation.   We went to Sable Hill to interview people thatCrime Intelligence has indicated they were interviewed.  Their statements were obtained and after their statements... after we have conducted preliminary investigation with regard to the inquiry docket, then we met with the advocate that Advocate Mzinyathi has allocated or assigned to the team.  That is Advocate Nemaorane.  It was not long after we have commenced, after we have done the preliminary, then we presented the statement before Advocate Nemaorane and in that presentation of statements, Advocate Nemaorane came with AdvocateJohnson.  TThey perused the statements in our presence and then they indicated to us to proceed with the investigation to complete it and we must bring back the inquiry docket to them.  I cannot remember when did we complete the investigation but what had happened is, after the completion of the inquiry, we submitted again back to them.  Then they    No, the meeting with Advocate Johnson... as Advocate Mzinyathi indicated to us Chairperson that Advocate Nemaorane is allocated to the team.  After we had done the preliminary investigation, we met with Advocate Nemaorane but at that meeting, Advocate Johnson was part of it when it would prevent now the preliminary investigation to Advocate Nemaorane.    No, there was no report given.  When I ...[intervenes]     No, no.  We presented the statementChairperson.  We did not... we went... the preliminary investigation was conducted in terms of obtaining the statement at Sable Hill.  Then we presented that statement to them and they indicated to us, we must proceed, complete the investigation in terms of the inquiry and we must bring the inquiry back to them.    I think it was in January 2017 Chairperson.   That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    No, they did not indicate to us at thatstage when it was at the stage of the inquiry docket when we presented to them at the preliminary stage.    Can the question be repeated?    Chairperson, I cannot remember whenwas that report drafted but when the Acting National Commissioner Mothiba came in, a report was drafted and we highlighted.  But I do not know in which stage, whether it was at the stage where they inquiry docket was... already was thedocket but a report, when the new Acting National Commissioner came Chairperson, it was submitted to the office of Acting National Commissioner.     It was a written report.    It was the team Chairperson.    It was presented to the Acting National Commissioner by then, Mothiba.     No, I... really, I do not want to commit myself.  I cannot remember which year was that.    That is correct, Chairperson because we were investigating whether there is any crime committed our investigation team.  That is why after we obtained the statement, then we put the statement before the prosecutorsfor the prosecutors to decide.    That is correct, Chairperson but I    Chairperson, it was not broadened.  Itwas still within the scope.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Can you repeat the page for me?    19.  I am there Chairperson.    Yes.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Yes, Chairperson.    I cannot recall but my supportingstatements for applying – I think it can be in the bundle, it can maybe assist in terms of the date.    Ja, I think it is 2017, Chairperson.     Page 14?   Yes, Chairperson, I am on page 14.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Page?    That is correct, I am on the page, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.    And page 30, my apologies, Mr Chair.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Can you repeat the question?    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    The one that is applying for the J50.    Page 19.    Ja.  And then the page?    Page 19.  Yes, I am on page 19.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Chairperson, we proceed with theinvestigation and we placed the docket before the prosecutors or the advocate at DPP’s office.    That is correct, Chairperson, but this …[intervenes]    This was not an ordinary docket like a complainant went to police station, register a docket and that docket allocated to a detective.  It was investigation that was allocated to an investigation team.  We continue and we submit it to DPP.    That is correct, Chairperson.    No, I cannot agree, Chairperson, this investigation, it was started by the team.  As I indicated, it is not an ordinary case where a complainant went to police station, open a case and thereafter the case is allocated to the relevant unit.  We investigated and we submit the docket before the DPP.    That is correct, Chairperson.    No, I am not suggesting that.  When we went and brief Advocate Mzinyathi, Chairperson.  Or maybe he allocated an advocate to the investigation.  When the docket was registered and put to Advocate Nemaorane, Advocate Nemaorane booked a docket to Advocate Mashuga.  That was the criminal docket now.  So that investigation is not my opinion, it was done that way.    Yes, we went, Advocate, we went to the advocate, Chairperson.    It was for us because we were already a team that is going to investigate to bring the DPPon board to say DPP, we are going to investigate this matter but we will also – because as I have testified, Chairperson, in our mind there were at public domain that IPID is investigating General Phahlane.   So we did not want to be seen as people who are now interfering in IPD investigation or countering the investigation.  So we want to bring the DPP on board.    My understanding is while the investigation – we have commenced with the investigation, the NPA will give directives in terms of whether there isany prima facie case in the docket or there is no prima facie case in the docket.    That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.    Chairperson, it was impersonating, that was actually drafted by Adv Mashuga.  There was also extortion, I can get extortion, intimidation and I think alsofraud.  That was actually drafted by Adv Mashuga, that was in the statement.     No, I did not open any other docket against members of IPID.    Chairperson, the question was, Iopened the docket against members of IPID.    They were charged on the samematter, Chairperson.    How it unfolded, Chairperson, after Mr Paul O’Sullivan and Sarah Jane Trent were charged and appear in court, the advocate who handled the case, Adv Mashuga give me directive to go and take warning statements of two members of IPID who were together with Mr O’Sullivan and Sarah Jane Trent at Sable Hills.  That is Mr Mandla Mahlangu, the late, may he so rest in peace,and then Mr Damani, both are members of IPID.  I went and obtained their warning statement and put the warning statement before Adv Mashwai(?).  Then he decided that those two members must be charged.    No, I am not aware of that charges, Chairperson.    Page 3.    Page 2 and 3?    Yes.    That is correct, Chairperson.     Chairperson, when I looked at this statement it seems it was actually a directive from the Advocate who handled the case, that additional statement, it will be obtained for the witness to clarify certain aspects.   Directives.  When I look through the statement because I know Adv Mashuga was issuing directives in writing whenever he wants us to obtain additional statement.  When I look to the formation of this statement, it seems additional statement as per query of Advocate Mashuga.    That is correct, Chairperson.   Ja, Chairperson.    No, Chairperson, I am not aware but normally when additional statement need to be obtained will always be the directive from maybe DPP or the advocate who handled the case. ADV HULLEY    That is correct, Chair.    Yes, Chairperson.    Chairperson, Mr du Preez is a driver of General Phahlane.  Now when the securities – actually, when we went to him, we want check in terms of thesecurity precautions and measures, that is why we approach him.    That is correct.    I think he indicated at one of the statements, Chairperson, I was aware, yes, Chairperson.   No, Chairperson, would relate to the threat levelled against Phahlane. The driver, he move around with him.   So we want to check whether there is any other thing that him himself is having or he knows of.    That is correct, Chairperson.   Ja, I think I met with him but in both – the statement was obtained by Colonel Dawood.  Yes, Imet with him at their office when his first statement was obtained.    The first statement?    Yes, Chairperson.    The statement that we actually were – as I have testified to say in terms of the security and the precaution, I think the first statement will also indicate to him to say we are investigating the threat against General Phahlane and we just want to know in terms of that.    Page?    300…?    Yes, 337.    3..?    Just help me with the page, 33..?    Chairperson, 337 is an index and under it is 338.  I do not know where I am on the…[intervenes]    You probably have a wrong bundle.  Go to bundle LEA17.  Look at the spine of the bundle, LEA17.  What have you – is it LEA17?  And on page 337 you have an index.  Okay, somebody will approach you to address this.     Oh no, I was looking the red one.    Okay, I have it, Chairperson, my apology.   I am on 337 now.     That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.      Chairperson our investigation commenced on the 30 t h of November 2016.  We did not do any investigation I had to do that.       And I do not know whether if this is an incorrect date but me I - in the team I commenced on the 30 t h of November 2016.      Yes it can be the 8 t h if the statement was on the 8 t h of November, if the statement was obtained by our team.       Can the question be repeated Chairperson I did not follow it, correctly so.      What my understanding is it seems he was threatened and he was informed that he must not talk about it.  If he talk about it, it will be an offence against him, that is my understanding Chairperson.       My understanding maybe is he put it in his statement when the statement was taken by IPID but nothing was done about that threat of him.      No we did not Chairperson.      That is correct Chairperson.      That is correct Chairperson.      That is correct Chairperson.     Chairperson as I indicated maybe the statement the advocate have said that the witness mustclarify his point that is why the statement was obtained.       My answer will be Chair maybe there was instruction from the DPP to clarify this because we could not went an obtained additional statement fromour own because we did not know of the statement, the draft statement that he received from IPID.      Ja, I think we meet on several times as a team Chairperson.  I cannot remember how many times but as a team we will meet, discuss, brief each other.      When we were conducting the investigation from 2016, we were doing it on ad hoc because most of the work was in Pretoria.  We will come maybe we will sleep over after we finish, we will go back, when the case appear, we will give the case to court.      Yes, it can be correct there because I know I was looking for his statement and I was struggling because of the commitment as a National Commissioner.  He schedule were very tight, hectic. When you make an appointment with him Chairperson, when you want to take the statement, he will be called for something and then you need to make another appointment with him, it was very hectic.      I cannot remember.    I cannot remember but I remember I do not know which year when he was a national acting during the award, I was at Sun City he was there.  I do not know which year was that one but it was during the police awards.      Yes.      No, I did not meet him he was there.  There was no meeting or anything between me and him, I was attending the awards, him as the National Commissioner he was there as the guest speaker or the keynote speaker of the event Chairperson.       Chairperson the case was struck offthe role when Advocate Mashuga applied for indictment and then actually to do the indictment and further to join other accused and the magistrate refused and say he strike it off the roll in terms of Section 342 whenever we want to put it back it must be with the instruction of the NDBP.     That is correct.      That is correct Chairperson.      Chairperson the cellphone was used in the commission of crime in the sense that information was sent to witnesses by her warning witnesses to attend to IPID office as if an investigator himself even providing case numbers.           To say I confirm the case number as an IPID case number.  It even indicates I confirm your status that you are not a suspect you are a witness but I warn you to come with your attorney regard Sarah-Jane Trent, to the witness to come to.  So that message we want to retrieve theinformation that was sent in terms of impersonating the IPID officials.        That is correct Chairperson but that cellphone Chairperson was seized during her arrest in terms of Section S it was used in a commission of criminal in terms of Section 20 and Section 23 allow a police officialwho can seize the item that is being suspected to be used which is in the custody of the person who is being arrested.  I applied those two sections to seize that cellphone Chairperson.       Yes.      That is correct Chairperson.      That is correct Chairperson.      That is correct Chairperson.      That is correct Chairperson.      Chairperson I was part of the operation the warrant of arrest of Miss Sarah-Jane Trent was executed by Brigadier Kgorane I was present.  Whathad happened is after we execute the warrant Miss Sarah-Jane Trent asked to phone her lawyer.  Brigadier Kgorane her to phone the lawyer and then we were having a lady their Captain Mashugu with us and then Miss Sarah-Jane Trent want to check something in the house.          He went with the Captain, the instruction Brigadier Kgorane was – after he was spoken with the cellphone you hand the cellphone to Captain Mashugu because he had already indicated to him when he arrested, we are going to seize it.  And what had happened is after we spoke with the cellphone he locked the cellphone in the boot of the car and then we went out with her.  When we arrived at the garage Brigadier Kgorane approached Captain Mashugu for the cellphone it is then that we realised that the cellphone was put on the boot and we drove back to seize it there.     Yes Sir, Chairperson.      In terms of the supplementary statement of supporting statements Chairperson it was not mentioned in my statement.      Yes Chairperson I am on page 19.      My apologies Chairperson which paragraph?    That is correct Chairperson.      It was requesting information from the witness.     As is if he is an investigator of IPID, Chairperson.      That is correct Chairperson.      No I did not apply for anything afterthe seizure of the cellphone.      I have already answered this Chairperson that I utilised the two sections of the seizure act, Section 20 and Section 23.  I did not see it necessary because there are two sections that empower a police official who can seize the actions that is being utilised or was used for the commission of the crime.      That is correct Chairperson.      Yes I was; I have testified to that that I was part of that team.      Chairperson it seems that there is a two picture that is being painted.  There was no separate investigation of IPID members the same case of Mr O’Sullivan and Miss Sarah-Jane Trent the advocatedecided that we must charge the two IPID members.  This case was struck off the roll when it was struck with regard to accused.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.   No.    No.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    Chairperson I need to give how things have unfold.   After the arrest of Ms Sarah-Jane Trent we went to court.  She applied for bail – actually she – she bring an urgent application, bail was granted.  After her release Chairperson she went and opened a case against her team. 1. Kidnapping against us.2. Theft of cell phone. And then after the arrest of Mr Paul O’Sullivan and after his release he went and opened a case against me specific when I do arrest of contempt of court.  IPID went and opened a case against the team, the former North West Provincial Commissioner for allowing us to come and do the investigation of defeating the end of justice.  Those are the cases that were investigated against us when we were doing the – that investigation.    LEA20?    71.  Yes Chairperson I am there.    Yes Chairperson it is my signature.    That is correct Chairperson.    Chairperson this was a warning statement.  Allegation was put before me with the dates anda venue.  I was responding to that.      It was defeating the end of justice Chair.    I cannot specific in terms of what was put to me but it was defeating the end of justice specific to say what did I defeat I cannot remember now. Chairperson.   That is incorrect Chairperson.    No Chairperson I have answered to say it was defeating the ends of justice but specifically I cannot now tell Chairperson actually the allegation against me in terms of defeating – I have conducted myself in this manner.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.  That is why I responded to it in this paragraph.   That is correct Chairperson.  It was onthe public domain that IPID is investigating General Phahlane.  Now once we get into the investigation of the security breach we see it fit to engage the DPP.    Yes.   That is correct Chairperson because the team only started on the 30 November 2016.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson. 
NCUBE:And I was also part of the investigation doing the investigation.  In terms of during December Chairperson.  It is incorrect it is supposed to be during November. I said they were briefing us Chairperson in terms of the security assessment they have done on the acting... the Acting National Commissioner.  I cannot remember the year Chairperson.  Chairperson, I will answer the question by saying.  This investigation, it was prosecutorialhandled investigation as I have indicated.  From the early stage of the inquiry, Advocate Nemaorane was in place.  When the docket was registered it was booked to Advocate Mashuga who were guided by them in terms of the statement that we had obtained as a team.  We did not include in ourselves to say there is a threat against the National Commissioner.  We put the statement before prosecutors who decided.  Chairperson, in terms of the charges, I think when the J50 was drawn up AdvocateMashuga also add the charge of intimidation with regard to the former Acting National Commissioner General Phahlane in terms of the email that was actually sent threatening.  It was not only an impersonating(?) charge only, Chairperson.  There were other few charges that Adv Mashuga drafted.    As I have already testified, Chairperson, to say we were checking in terms as a driverin terms of the security precautions and measures.  That is correct Chairperson normally the additional - there is a statement that wastaken at the first instances and maybe the Prosecutor read it through that statement.  He will always say please obtain a clarifying certain aspects.     Yes and it continued their Chairperson that the mobile number is registered in the name of Trent, Sarah-Jane with ID number 840214023208. Incorrect Chairperson.This investigation Chairperson was done through prosecutorial guide investigation from the inquiry docket until they advise us to open a criminal docket.  Nowhere that we should – we were actually fabricating.  No I think Chairperson I was responding to allegation as I have already indicated.  It was put to me with the dates that I commit this and I – Iresponded the way I responded. 
ADV JOUBERT:  Mr Chair I just have – perhaps have one aspect to clear up?    Just one aspect I need to clear up.    Brigadier Ncube on the last document you were referred to Exhibit LE23 page 71 to 74 your warning statement.  Now you will remember your – your evidence is that from the outset this was a prosecution driven – norather a prosecution overseeing investigation.  You mention in paragraph 5.3 in your warning statement that a designated advocate, Advocate Mashuge decided that Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent must be charged.  Now can you just explain is it not very extraordinary that already by the February of 2017 we know by the 8 February Advocate Mashuge requested warrants for their arrest?  Is that not indicative indeed that at that very short period of time and Advocate of the High Court was already designated to deal with this matter?    Very well.  And just with reference to the affidavit where the incorrect date was mentioned by Mr Van Zyl you can see that affidavit was deposed to and taken on 8 December so clearly it must have been a typographical error when he said he was seen by members on the 8 November.   And at no stage is your – is the warning – the summary of your investigation from the outset you simply did your job as a police officer.  You gathered evidence on instruction under the direction of the DPP in this matter?    Thereafter any decisions of prosecution was taken by the DPP and the entire indictment and a summary of substantial facts is also before them – thiscommission where it – where it – which contains a summary of the events and the decision to charge whoever we charged inclusive the members of IPID?    Thank you Mr Chair.    It is in order Mr Chairperson.    I will not be that long.    I do not anticipate to be longer than twenty minutes.    Well…   Yes.    Well the more concerning on just to followon that and complete that point Mr McBride is that their involvement from the statements of witnesses be it now factually correct or incorrect to interrogate witnesses.  To draft statements for them.  On just those two levels it is totally unacceptable because a complainant should not getinvolved on that level especially when they investigate a very high-profile member of the police like IPID did.  Do you not agree?  It actually boils down to – to a pre-trial or investigative irregularity because it is uncalled for and it should not be tolerated or done.      But that is a summary ja.    Yes.  Look Mr McBride there is always in the important work the police have to do a right way to do things and the wrong way and in between there should not be any – any leeway.  Because police and IPID specifically are indeed mandated to fulfil very important functions in this country.      And they gather evidence that evidencemust go eventually and stand the test of – of constitutional admissibility and admissibility in courts.  So that is the reason why the institutions are required to do the work correctly in the right way and not the wrong way.      Correct.  Because and then just the last final aspect of – of the inappropriate it appears the relationship between IPID and these two complainants when one objectively analyse it appears the information that wasshared between the IPID members and the two investigators that the commission can find in Exhibit LE19 from page 255 to 416 that if you do an analysis again I would submit in all fairness you would agree that for these two complainants…    There is many – many pages Mr Chair and I – let me do – put it as a summary because…    If one Mr McBride if one does an analysis or an analysis of the information and the type of sensitive information that was shared against – or between members of IPID and Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent on whatsapp and in sms’s then that is indeed also inappropriate.  Do you agreeand the reason for serious concern?    Yes.  Most probably it would not haveended even there – if Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent did not accompany the IPID members to Sable Hills to commence their investigation.    Ja.  So in all fairness will you then concede that to paint the members of the police in the worst possible light is not fair upon them in this commission because you can only cast assertions and make assumptions that or appears not to be corroboration.  Well that has to – the function of the commission eventually to establish    Well I do not think that – that it – that is the – all the criticisms that maybe or can be validly levelled at them is not for purposes of what we are currently here for.    Ja. My Lord ag – Mr Chair I do not think it is necessary.    I think I have made a point what happenedin this instance that …    That the members investigated the matter.  The DPPA got involved and they found many irregularities and they eventually decide to prosecute people on that.  Andit was not on the insistence of the members of the North West police.    Will you accept that Mr McBride?    Thank you Mr Chair.    Yes Mr Chair I can put in record.    We do not have any questions for Major Booysen.

Yes, I got it.    141, yes.    It is my signature, yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes, Chairperson.   Yes.    Page 4.  Yes, I am there.    I am there.    Correct, Chairperson. ADV HULLEY    Correct, Chairperson.    Correct, Chairperson.    Correct, Chairperson.    Chairperson, as it has already been admitted to the fact that I was the Deputy Provincial Commissioner reporting to the Provincial Commissioner of the North West.I actually... I was called by the provincial commissioner in the early morning to her office wherein she informed me that she had a call from the then Acting Division ofCommissioner of Crime Intelligence where she might request our assistance in terms of an investigation that relates to a security threat to the then Acting National Commissioner, Lieutenant General Phahlane.      Come again?    Yes.   I am referring from my office in Potchefstroom.    General Motswenyane.    Yes.    Ja, when we reported for work.  I think it was... I am not quite sure but I think it might have been between half-past seven and eight o’clock.    No, obviously, what would have happened, my staff officer would have received a call.  Normally, I would wait to see who instructed me.  Is it an official or is it personnel to phone my office to say, “Can you summons the general to my office?”    You would not personally phoned me.  Then I will be informed by my staff officer orwhoever.      Oh, sorry, sorry.    Okay.    Okay, sorry.  I am sorry.    Okay.    I reported to her office, yes. On the same day.  It is the same building.  It does not need me really to drive.  It is just for me to walk.  It is maybe a minute and I will be in her office.    She explained me the alleged security breach.    Yes, she said there is thisallegation.    She informed me because apparently, she did receive a request from the ActingDivisional Commissioner to avail myself to assist in terms of the allegations.    That is the record that I have received from the then Provincial Commissioner, General Motswenyane.    Well, I cannot say she specifically because I do not know the conversation.  How it came to myself personally.  I think the person who would be in the position is the one who informed me.    Yes.    Not... I am not going to say,specifically me.  This is what I say.  I am the... the Provincial Commissioner said he received a request from the Acting Divisional Commissioner to avail an investigator to investigate the alleged security breach.  So I do not want to bind myself to say specifically it wasme.  He never said to me.  He said, specifically you.  So I do not know whether he came to his own discretion or what but I am not going to.    Correct.    No, she did not indicate.  It was upon myself to assemble a team but obviously I would then engage with her to say, I would need a team.  Because remember, I had other responsibilities in the province.      No, there was no need for me at that time when I informed to require where because theonly statement and maybe it was, there is this security breach at the house of the Acting National Commissioner in Pretoria and then the Crime Intelligence is requested and wanted to come and assist in terms of the investigations.    Yes.    Yes.    I did not because it was not a surprise.  It is a practise.    I was not surprised.    Because in the police, that is how it works.  You are not having a boundary to investigate because we are a national competency.  So I was not surprised.    No, I did not Chair.    My elaboration is, I was not surprised.  It seems your question was like you said, like I was not... for me, it was not something that is very strange for someone who can be approached from one province to do investigation in another province.    It is a normal experience within the police.    Yes.    I will not say there is a specific case because then otherwise I would be trying to...but as far as I know, there is that kind of arrangement within the police.    Yes.    Look, I am not going to bind myself to say certain types of investigations because for me it lies with the discretion of whoever approaches.So I am not going to dictate this is the type but what I know there is that kind of cross-provincial investigations where people are actually requested to do work in other provinces.   Yes.    Yes.    Okay.   No, I do not recall the date.     Ja.  What the Provincial Commissioner informed me is I must, as you say, assemble a team and go to Crime Intelligence to have... because he did not have the full facts of what is really going to happen.  So obviously, he would send me to Crime Intelligence to go and have a hearing.   Yes.    Well, I am not sure whether itwas the same day but I did go to get a team to Crime Intelligence.    No, I looked at people withmore experience in terms of people who were previously in DPCI, Brigadier Kgorane and Brigadier Mobe(?) and Colonel Dawood who did previously DPCI with more experience.  So I was looking into that.  But in addition, I also nominated a person from Legal Service to be part of the team.    Yes.    I wanted him because of... remember, we are dealing with legal issues and once wehave someone we feel your investigation team from legal experience, you are always... it is always there to assist.    No, the investigations as well.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes, it was.   Basically, it is like we were told that there is a security breach in the residence of the Former Acting National Commissioner and threat level against him.  And then there were also some emails that were produced to us that would also amount to the threats.    It was basically that I did not... unless I have to elaborate exactly what they said. There was this vehicle and so on.  I am not sure whether you want me to go as far as that.    In terms of the substance, it was said they have done a security assessment and then in terms of this assessment, the feeling is the life of the Acting National Commissioner is in danger and it requires us to do further investigation as to verify as to whether there iscriminality. ADV HULLEY    Yes.    Yes.    From my side it was Brigadier Ncube, Brigadier Kgorane, Colonel Ready, and Lieutenant Colonel Dawood by that time.  And then from Crime Intelligence, if I remember well, there were three people.    It was the Acting Regional Commissioner, General Makhele, Brigadier Moyane(?) and the other colleague, I only know him as BM and I do not... I cannot remember what is his surname but he was full general.    I quickly... I can think quickly of the three.  I cannot remember whether there were more than that but my memory, if it serves me well, it says threepeople.    Yes.    Makhele, yes.    General BM.  I think it is a nickname.  I do not have the surname.    No, I think it is a nickname but ...[intervenes]     Ja, BM.  Like...    That is what they call him.  I do not know whether it is his initials or what but     Yes. [laughs]      Correct.    It is correct.    As far as my memory serves me well, we only received the emails, a number of emails.    It was Brigadier Moyane.     Yes.  Well, the Acting Divisional Commissioner was acting... or he act then and there but the main person who was actually taking us to it was Brigadier Moyane.    I think the 30t h.    The 30t h of November.    2016.   Yes.    Well, they did not go as far as telling us the written document.  They said they have donethis assessment and this is what they felt but it was not clear as to whether there is a document that they have compiled.    Yes.    No.    Look, as far as I recall, theyspoke about this vehicle that went to the residence of the Acting National Commissioner driving by one white person and white lady and two African males and they were posing certain questions which might amount to also breach of security as well.  That is basically what they were trying to tell us.  And then on top of that, they give us also emails that would actually suggest that there were certain threatening remarks on the emails.      Yes, somehow.  Yes.    I think they said they went and checked the ownership of the vehicle which came out to a certain person called Paul O’Sullivan.    Yes.    Well, the only – the other two, I know it was only two African males but by then we did not have the names, who the people were.     Yes.     Yes, after the briefing by Crime Intelligence myself and my team we went out and decide on the way forward.     The first thing that I did because obviously even that time it was very much rife or it was well-known fact that General Phahlane  was more oneNCA.  IPID was like on top of him.  So one would actually say but it is public knowledge that IPID, they are busy investigating General Phahlane.Now the question you ask, now you still have to do security threats on the very same.  Now it puzzled me. Then I said to the team I think the first thing that one need to do, I will phone the DPP.  I phoned the DPP personally because with the current situation now, one goes there, you are actually see as – remember, the media, IPID was involved more with media so one would need really to look at your own integrity.  So I phoned DPP, but DPP, I remember very well, was not – I think he was not at work, he was on leave, because remember now it was more on festive(?).  He told me that I am not at work and then I said no, but there isthis urgent thing that I want to see you.  Then he agreed.  He moved to his office and I went with Brigadier Ncube and Colonel Dawood.  I briefed him to say Advocate, this is what we found from Crime Intelligence.  Now the reason why I am coming here, I am looking puzzled because we are aware that the same – the residence of General Phahlane, there is this investigation that you saw over the news.  So I want – let us share ideas, I am not sure whether to go or not.  Then he presented what CrimeIntelligence gave.  Then he said to me no, but General, investigation is investigation, you will need to carry on with the investigation but because of the level of the issues now, you know, what is happening currently, I will assign an advocate that will deal with the team and on that verysame note he said to me he will give me Advocate Nemaorane.  That was the understanding and then after then one was relieved to say now at least DPP is giving go-ahead because it was an extraordinary situation, this one.     Advocate Mzinyathi.     Yes, I think he is based inPretoria.     Yes.     I am saying I decided to go and see Advocate Mzinyathi as the DPP.     It was well-known fact that IPID they were busy with investigation on the very samearea where he know – we have this security threat.  Now he has two investigations, the other one, it is in favour of General Phahlane, the other one is against him.  Now you come – you remember, we all observed that IPID has mandates to investigate.  Now you cannot be seen whensomebody is investigating you come in as well.  It does not make sense.  So now – and also, it does not – you know, on an interim basis nothing would have stopped me to go there to investigate but I will say to avoid whatever might come, let me go to the DPP, tell him this is what we see, what does it say because the other thing, the DPP would also be aware that the Acting National Commissioner at his level is being investigated.Now obviously all these investigations will go to hisoffice as DPP.  So that is why I felt - I used that discretion to say I must go to him.      Look it is also public knowledge, when IPID was investigating General Phahlaneearlier than that there was somewhere where Paul O’Sullivan issues were coming in, in that investigation on the media.  It was not a secret.     Yes, I say …[intervenes]     Yes.  But, on top of that, while General Phahlane was investigated, the name of Paul O’Sullivan was coming into play as well.     Yes.     There was that relationship.  It was clear, there was a relationship between Paul O’Sullivan …[intervenes]      And IPID by that time.     Yes.     It is based on the media reports.  It is also based on the briefing that you received to say they are seeing Paul O’Sullivan when he went to theresidence the Acting National Commissioner.  He identify himself as a member of IPID.  Yes.     No, I have not started because – I have not started the investigation because my investigation obviously when you carry, you can link on the very same premises where General Phahlane is.  That is why I wanted to clear the air so that tomorrow it must not be someone went and tried to do whatever.  So that is why for me from investigation perspective I want to clear the airso that if the DPP said no, no, I am aware of this investigation and then says carry on with the investigations, at least obviously there must not be a commission because like I have said, IPID have a total mandate to investigate.  We also have a mandate to investigate which causes – for me personally it causes a little bit of a confusion.     I wanted to inform the DPP to say this is what we received, the complaint, we are going to investigate that but on the same breath we are aware that there is investigation in the very same premises, again the person who is alleged there are security threats against him.     Come again?  Can you justrephrase it?     Yes.     Mzinyathi, yes.     That In that meeting we were given a green light by the advocate.  In addition, he said he will assign Advocate Nemaorane to be from theNPA’s side to supervise this investigation.     Correct.     I would not say a meeting because immediately after we go the green light from the DPP, Advocate Mzinyathi, then my instruction was now that we have consulted the DPP we must as soon as possible – because, I mean, if there is a security threat it means weneed to act, so we must start with the investigation.     Actually, Chairperson, I needed his opinion.     I was …[intervenes]     I …[intervenes]     No, I …[intervenes]     No.     Yes, we did.     No, in terms of my experience I never had opinion from …[intervenes]     This was the first time.  That is why I am saying …[intervenes]     Yes.     Because already I wasaware that there was an investigation on the very same premises by IPID.      So I then have question marks to myself, do you go forward and go back?     Because it is possible that if this thing is not properly communicated there might be a reason for people to say you are interfering.     Because it is more you are on the borderline.      Yes.     Yes.     Right, Chairperson.    Why?    No, I am not aware why.     No, I cannot answer that one whether it is appropriate but I do not know who they involved.     I presented the emails to him, I also shared with him the information that I received not documented in terms of the activities but according to Crime Intelligence their view as such as a security threat.     Yes.     Yes, even if we are aware that IPID they are busy with other investigations the other side.     Yes.     Correct.     My role would have beenstatements would be taken, they will be presented to me.  Where the team needs any resources in terms of the investigation, I will make sure that I get the necessary resources for the team to work.       I would move from time to time as it requires into North West and Gauteng of theprovince for the sake of the investigation.     Yes, Chairperson, at my position as a Deputy Provincial Commissioner, most of the time you do account as a province to the National Commissioner.  So our interaction would be based on that.     Correctly so.     Yes.    Because of the type of work I do, I might not have specific places where I would meet the National Commissioner, not specific to [indistinct] Where the National Commissioner would require me toreport, I will.     Correct.     Normally it would be verbal reports because if they want to verify certain threats, I amalso having access to the case docket.     The case docket.     Yes.     I do receive reports, correctly so.     Yes.     No because once I receivethe reports you can interact with the team to say can you go and obtain certain statement despite the fact that remember this was a prosecutorial guided investigations but you go through the reports and then, for example, where you need some forensic reports you intervene.  Where the team has got – when you go through the reports you see there they are lacking, you supply them with the necessary resources to complete their investigation.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I report to the person who appoints us.     Which is Acting Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence.    Correct.     Correct.     I never reported in writing, I reported verbally to her.     Page…     Yes.     Yes, I have got it.     The mandate to conduct to investigation security threat against Acting National Commissioner, counter and security intelligence inquiry.  So what was the question?    This document is the one that I got from the Acting Divisional Commissioner via the office of the Provincial Commissioner.    Yes.     Afterwards.     Correct.     Yes.     Correct.     I think this is the incident in terms of the vehicle that I spoke to.     Ja, I said the vehicle, when it was screened, it belonged to Mr Paul O’Sullivan.     Yes because they gave registration number of the vehicle.     Yes.     Yes, they said the vehicle belongs – according to the screening, according to the registration numbers, yes.     H’m.    Yes.     It is the same.     Do you want me to answer that?     Well, my opinion – because now I have to give my opinion because I cannot answer on their behalf.     I do not know, yes.     Verbal report? ADV HULLEY     It was communicated yes, but it was not communicated in writing.     Yes.    As I was giving the reports, it was impossible for us to finalise this, so the acting Divisional Commissioner whom we were giving feedback to, he agreed to say we must – we can extend.    Yes.      Yes.       Correct.     To the acting Divisional Commissioner?    Yes.     I think just rephrase again?     Yes.     No, it was never – it remained as it is there’s no other mandate that we received except this.     Yes.     Correct.     What I call intimidation that is up to the Chairperson to decide, whether it’s aligned to – as part of that threat.     Yes. ADV HULLEY     Yes.       Against who?     No, it won’t be.     Yes, not against – maybe you don’t understand.     Yes Chairperson.     There was.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, I don’t want to get much into the merits of the cases…[intervenes].     Ja, now if memory serves me well it might be against one of them, it might be two but as far as I understand…[intervenes].     It’s one.     Paul O’Sullivan.     Ja, if memory serve me well, in terms of that.     Well, I can’t answer that, I’m not in a position.       Yes, Chairperson.     We, as a team.       No.     No, we didn’t.     Yes, yes.     That’s correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct Chairperson.     42?     Did you say page 42?     Yes.     The following page?       Ja, I’m looking here.     Yes.     He communicated that to us, yes.     Well I can’t talk on hisstatement I can talk only on the briefing that I received from Brigadier Moyane, this person, I don’t even know him.     Correct yes.     Can I ask, when was it?    Yes, when I gave the statement, I just want to…     Okay.     59?     I’m at 59.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.    60 Neh?     Let me go to it, 5.1 I don’t see it.     On page 60?     I don’t see.   Yes, 28.     Hang on, yes.      No, I haven’t moved.    LE23.     I’ve got…[intervenes].     Yes.     Yes.     I think, this one, I can’t – I don’t know how it came in here, I can’t remember.     I can’t remember how this one came because my knowledge was saying, I never received the report.     Yes.     Ja, according to it but me, Ican’t remember this one.     I’m not sure as well it was provided.     No, I don’t have the report with me.    No.     No, I never saw the report.     Chair, the only – what I canremember is, we were briefed as I’ve previously said but the report, I can’t remember whether I did see the report myself.     Yes, I can’t recall because I tried to – before the Commission I tried to read just to check how did we – because my understanding was like, it was actually presented verbally to me.     I do agree sir.    Yes.      No, I don’t recall that, yes.     No, not possible you can’t quote something…[intervenes].     Yes.     I might have seen it yes.     Yes.     That’s something I can’tquote on.     Yes.     I can’t respond to thatbecause I’m also – in my mind I’m trying to check, how did this thing come into play.     Yes.   Yes.    There was a crime intelligencealso there was – we tried to find out whether it was that.  We never got.    There was this issue of the bodies missing.  We heard there was this the ones who were doing the investigation.     No I have not tried.    No.    Sorry?    Because I could not – I did not remember whether the report was in my possession.    Yes it is but also…    Yes.    Yes but the – Chair the documents according to me it was supposed to be Crime Intelligence.  Crime Intelligence said they do not have the document – it is misplaced.    No from our side because Idid not receive the – I did not have it in my possession.  I from the other side of Crime Intelligence who are actually the compiler of the document.  It is where to make some enquiries from them they could not give the document to us.    I – I tried to find out among the team members but we could not find out actually how this– we could not come with answers.      I cannot tell you.  I cannot safely say   Because I do not have it with me.    Yes.    Chair, I want to apologise.  When I came here, I was busy refreshing on my statementthat I submitted to the Commission.    This, actually, came as a surprise.    Now what I did during the break, I tried to go through the whole statement.    This warning statement.    It changed my mind now how this ...[indistinct] was.  I really want to apologise for that.    Because really, I do not even think of this.   Now when I read here and the warning statement where I submitted those statements because I have submitted lots of warning statements.  So I did not know which one it was.    Now I recall very well.     And I think someone can testify on my behalf.   When we...[intervenes]     Yes.    The one of Crime Intelligence.    I want to also to be firm to say, I have never seen the report when we were initiallybriefed by Crime Intelligence.    On the 30t h.    But now I remember.  WhenIPID approached us, we were represented by an advocate from Pretoria.  I cannot recall the name.    Yes.    Is there in submitted that statements.  Moyane and General Makhele were supposed to be charged as well.  On that day when we were consulting with the advocate, this part of their input.    I just, when I read through these things, I read though and I said but something.    So but, in fact, I did not have in my possession but in the beginning, we did not had it because it was ...[indistinct] from the report has into mywarning statement.    So I want to apologise because I was just thinking.    Yes.  So I ...[intervenes]     Yes, Advocate Joubert.    Advocate Joubert.  Not this Joubert but the other one in Pretoria.    Yes.    [Indistinct]     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  And then the advocateextracted the same information from that then.    But I never had it in my possession.    It is only afterwards.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes, the advocate quoted it from that document.      I can talk to this gentlemanhere who I am referring to if he has got a copy with him.    Yes.    239.     Yes.     Yoh, it is a long time ago.  In the [indistinct] I think he said he was part of it, there was Brigadier Dukwana, it was General Mokoena who is now the head of the Hawks in Mpumalanga.  There was also Gola from Gauteng, there was also I think Ramakhosi,there were a number of them.     Yes.     Maybe let me first do it thisway so that the Chair can understand.  When I was appointed to deal with Cato Manor my mandate was a fact-finding mission in terms of the newspaper article that was printed on the national media.   Then I assembled – I was appointed and the terms of reference that I have said it was exactly like that, we did obtain statements from people and then the reports were sent to General Dramat and then out of that report I think there were certain steps that were taken against those members.  But it does not end up just there, Chairperson.  Whilst we were busy with that investigation, even in terms of my statement, IPID was also busy with criminal investigations against the same Cato Manor led by Mr Khubane.So it was more of parallel investigations but our mandate was not the same but what I did, when I [indistinct] in cases and I make sure because General Dramat gave us instruction to say when you arrive, you go to IPID, you inform IPID that this is what you are busy with again.   But amongst ourselves we had a legal person as well who would also assist us.  I think he left the police, Colonel Vassan, if I remember very well.So as we are about to wrap up our fact-findingmission there was this interaction between the then head of IPID, maybe ICD by that time, Mr Beekman, and General Dramat as well as the Acting National Commissioner General Mkhwanazi by then.   In that interaction of them, they then – because by then when we did this fact-finding mission I came to realise IPID long time ago they were already busy with this investigation against Cato Manor but when we give the briefing and there was a decision taken, actually it was a request from IPID  IPID request – Mr Shoga(?) part of that,I see he is here as well.   They requested – they delivered to General Dramat.  General Dramat, I see your guys are moving faster on this fact-finding mission, would like this team to combine with our team to support them.  General Dramat, nè?  Withouteven my team.  General Dramat, there was that kind of an agreement.   Now we have to leave the fact-finding mission, we have to concentrate now on the criminal investigation.  We worked together with IPID, that is how – I want to say.  But I also want to highlight this.  When I was co-opted with my team into IPID because when they were presenting, we were all there but what – there were certain witness that I identified.  I emphasised that while they were doing these cases, they were dragging too long butthere was no way where a prosecutorial guided investigation was on - coming on.   They were complaining about the reports, the reconstruction of the crime scene and immediately when we met I spoke to them to say people, we are here to assist as we are instructed by the chiefs of us but I want to know from you, do you have the dedicated prosecutor who deals with this matter?  The answer was no.   Then I said, I said it myself, I cannot work with you whilst we do not have prosecutor guided investigationsbecause these were all cases, complicated.  Then I take it upon myself, I said no, I will approach the DPP case again.  [indistinct] assigned a dedicated prosecutor for the first time into this team where we were working together with them.  I took it upon myself, I did notknow the DPP cases then but later on I realised Mr Mlotshwa was the Acting DPP.   I phoned Mr Mlotshwa.  Mr Mlotshwa, here I am, I explained exactly what I have explained to the Commission.   But what I see literally here, we do not have a prosecutor who is going to assist this investigation.  Then he did not answer me.   He said no, General, I am busy in a meeting can we meet after four?  Then we agreed.  We never went to his office by the way, he then suggested where can we meet?  Then I did know cases then by then, he said no, I think we agreed, we are going to meet at the provincial headquarters of KZN, the police [indistinct].  We met outside. Then I presented myself to him.   What he told me, he said  General, I hear what  you say, it is a good thing that you think but I can only tell you these guys, my prosecutors, they are afraid of these Cato Manor people, you are not going to get anything out of them, can I advise you – this is his words, can I advise you?  I say yes.  Hesaid no, you better – because now we are like a national investigation you need that deals with together with IPID.  It is better for you to can maybe make contact with the NDPP.Then also make an undertaking to say but I haveinformed the NDPP to say this is what you request but do me a favour also, make a follow-up the next morning.  He gave me the number of the Acting DPP by then.  Unfortunately, it was, because this is  – it was General Jiba who was the Acting DPP.The next morning I phoned Advocate Jiba.  Advocate Jiba, this is the situation.  But when I presented this to him it was like it was not a surprise.  No, Mr Mlotshwa has already informed me.  What I need, you and the team of IPID, you must make an appointment with myoffice to come and brief me what resources you need from me.  It is what he says.The next week Mr Angus - because that time, immediately after that conversation they decided IPID to withdraw Kuba, Mr Kuba(?) , because we were not happy with how he led the team.  They replaced him with Mr Angus.  I then – because I was told strictly as Advocate Jiba said, said you come in. I [indistinct]  your colleague to my office. I went with Mr Angus who was actually leading the team of IPID. We went there.  When we arrived in Pretoria, we found Advocate [indistinct].  We then briefed them, this is the situation how we come into IPID investigation.  I explained that.  After that then she said to me General, I see this is a very serious investigation, do you have anyone in mindthat you feel you can be compatible working with?  I said to him, no, I do not know people in Gauteng, the only person that I know is Advocate Maema.Then Advocate Maema - then said to me I will talk to Advocate [indistinct]  but I am not sure he will release that person because he was a Deputy DPP in North West but on then on the same breath he asked me do you know Advocate Mathenjwa?  I said no, I do not know him.  He says no, Advocate Mathenjwa is this guy who is dealing with the case of DPP(?) he is one of the best advocates.  Then I said [indistinct]  is fine.  But then what happened, he nominated six advocates.  Three deputy directors, the one is currently in Pretoria …[intervenes]     Chair?     No, I say what happened, he nominated six advocates.     And DPP.    To assist this team.  But on the same breath, I do not know why, he said Advocate Maema will be the leader of those advocates.  It was – I cannot recall the names but I know only there is Adv Mlotshwa, I think he is the deputy in Free State.  Maema is the deputy in North West.  Mathenjwa is the deputy in Gauteng and there are other senior advocates.  They came.  They came, then …[intervenes]     No, no, because I – look, I think [indistinct].  I asked for an advocate.     No, not necessarily, not Chair, maybe they even presented.    Yes, they were represented, he felt maybe this is a big case.     So these people came downand then from there then Advocate Mathenjwa arrived, it was five of them but he informed us and IPID, we were called, to us and IPID to say we are here at the request of these two colleagues, Angus and General Mabula to assist in this investigation but I made it clear Advocate Maemawill be the leading advocate.     It was Advocate Mathenjwa now.     In Durban because he came down.     Yes and they went throughall the work.       Yes, but later, I think two weeks later, Advocate Maema, he knew – I think he was busy with some court cases.       He came down.     That is how I get involved. I just wanted to clear this thing to the …[intervenes]     Yes because it is like, Chair, I am one who just raise hands every time, give methis thing, give me these things.   But I also want to put it on record as well, when I was removed from DPC, the same like John Booysen, the same like the other people, when [indistinct]  came he removed all of us.  We were gone.  That is why we went back to the detectives.   When I was removed, I then said to General Ntlemeza I am busy with this case, can I please be excused from it because now I have to focus in the provincial work.  It was refused.  The current head of theHawks, when he took over, I wrote a letter through the Provincial Commissioner, I do not want to go back to KZN on these cases, I want to focus on the province, I am no longer in DPCI.  They refused.  I wanted to just make this statement so that people can understand my involvement because it seems as if, you know, I am very much [indistinct] what I said.     Yes.     Mlotshwa?     Meama.     It is not there, that is why Isaid I want to give the background.  I wanted to give the Chairperson – he must have an understanding before you start how I come into picture, it is not there.  But people who come and testify will tell the same thing.     At Pretoria.     Correct.     Can I rephrase it?  I never said I want a dedicated prosecutor from Advocate Jiba, Isaid I want a dedicated – the first meeting that I had with Advocate Mlotshwa I wanted a dedicated prosecutor to assist, of which he said he do not think these people would be able to because they were afraid of Cato Manor.  That is what he said.  What he can do is to arrange – he actually suggested that maybe national must provide because we were actually doing a sort of a national investigation.   When I went to speak to Advocate Jiba I never said to him I want one, but I want what, I presented because Iwas with Mr Angus.  We presented what the current situation is in KZN and how far IPID is.  Because remember, I was thinking who, they were already there.  The presentation was more reliant on them.  So then out of her own discretion she sent six advocates.     Yes.     No, I said we want a – we presented.     After we presented because I believe other people were also - there were IC, he already briefed him.     To say we are coming we need this kind of report.    So after we presented, he said, he is General [indistinct] out your presentation I do not think one advocate is enough to deal with what you present to me.     No.     No…     No, that is why I am saying– I am saying this thing because he wanted to know which advocate do you have in mind that can help you to be comfortable with.     Then I said Advocate Maema .  It is then that she said no, but I do not think what your presentation that you presented to me, it might not need one.  If you want to formalise this matter.     Yes.     No, I did not, no.     Yes.     Yes.     Not it was only two of us.    From the NPA’s side it was Advocate Mosini(?) and Advocate Jiba.     Yes.     Advocate Mosini.     Yes.    To assist – I understand who have in mind to assist you.     Yes.     Yes.    I do not remember when she said six, whether I am saying he sent six, he says ifmaybe because I remember as well he might have said you need more than that, not necessarily to say six but when people are having cases then it was five, outstanding one, which is Advocate Maema.      Because I wanted to finalise the case, to go back home.  I did not want to stay in KZNbecause I had a problem with the language area there.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    I would not have taken the statements.  People go out and take statement because one, I had the problem, I have got language barrier.  So to give people opportunity because some of the team members they understand the Zulu so for me it was – it hadno purpose.  The same like Angus, he never went out and take statements because he does not – he is not familiar with Zulu.  So we are more of managers together with the prosecutors.     Not all the statements, remember, because it was IPID this side, it is this side but it is one team.     Yes.     At that stage General Booysen was not featured, I do not at what – maybe I do not understand you, rather rephrase it.     Oh, sorry, Chair.     Well, I cannot remember at what stage but remember also it is not my duty to institute criminal investigation, mine is to ensure when the prosecutors have got a certain query a statement must be taken, I must ensure that statement is taken but for me it is a little bit too heavy to say at what stage I decide because that is not a function.  I think in my statement you have seen what in terms of Section 205(3) what are thefunctions of the police but if you are going to suggest to say at what stage do, I charge General Booysen, I think that is very much unfair.  Do not push me to something that I am not privy to.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.    Yes.    Okay.     Look, I do not take decision, I do not input on NPA’s decision.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    No.     No, Chairperson.     In [indistinct] yes.     Yes.     No, I was not …[intervenes]     Yes.     Because the good thing also, Chairperson.     You have six advocates.    When you come in because there is too many brains.     But the Chairperson was correct to say I had a luxury, it was for the first time to have that kind of luxury to scratch my head.     Because they were there, why should I?    Yes.     No.     No.     Not all of them because remember I said it was a joint team.   Mr Angus was on aequal – I put him – even if we had that cooperation, it did not give me a licence really to get deeper into what he is because our team also had – we only had – maybe, for example, when the prosecutors would address to say we need this statement, must be taken, we need these things, we have one another in terms of resources because the issue was to finalise this matter.  That would suggest that I had not.     Yes.     Yes.     I hear what you say.  I am not sure whether I understand correctly.    Obviously because we were supporting them.     Yes, there was that kind of an interaction.    Like I have said, resources wise, what we needed - for example, I have to get people from – because reconstruction of the crime scene, I had people from forensics to assist.      So we helping one another.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes we did.    Yes.     Look Chairperson those advocates on a daily basis they were with us.    So whatever this would have made they were just on the same of whom, but our issues was whenever they raised any queries to go on statement, we ensured that happens.  If IPID they don’t have the transport to go to a point A we would give because it was a joint investigation.   It was not a matter of we are we or what, because even when these people come back in the afternoon to the briefing session the prosecutors are there to say what you are required to do ordone is one, two, three.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Unless Chair if I had gotspecific interest, I said it in terms of Section 2053 what are my functions and I am sure NPA they do have certain functions.     So I don’t want to be dragged in some other department.  So that is my answer.     No.     He has I think General – Brigadier Mubi is the one, there were a number of teams that arrested him, I was not part of the arrest, when he was arrested.     I don’t have the reason to give instructions because I was dealing with very experienced investigators who knows what is expected of them during the arrest.  So I did not need really to have done that, I wouldn’t.     19?     LEA23?     It is not this one.     Yes, but ...[intervenes]      I don’t have 19.     No.     Let me see, maybe I’ve got, maybe I didn’t – okay 19,  yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct so Chairperson.     Correct Chairperson.     Correct Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     Not at all Chairperson. 
NTHEBO JAN MABULA:  (d.s.s.)    (d.s.s.) 
EXAMINATION BY ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  It is major general if I understand correctly?  Is that so? 
MABULA:No, not necessarily investigating, what I am saying, whatever investigation that was relating – in relation to General Phahlane, Paul O’Sullivan’s name was also featuring into.  No, no, no, the investigation that was about to start.  I have got the …[intervenes]  No there was no recommendations because the investigation was not finalised.  There were no recommendations that were sent to anybody but what I can say, there were some reports that were forwarded to the – because after General Phahlane was put aside there was a new acting National Commissioner who came, he requested us to submit progress report and understand what kind of investigation we’re doing, that was General Mothiba and General Sithole, the current sitting National Commissioner, when he took office, the same applied as well, we didsubmit that kind of report to him.   The charges that was opened, it was intimidation, a person impersonating this IPID members and fraud, out of the investigation that weconducted.    No there was not intimidation…[intervenes].  Ja, here’s page 60…[intervenes].  Was part of Crime Intelligence’s input.  It was actually connected to my warning statement.  I recall now.  That was the understanding, we were working together.  That is why they requested our support. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Good afternoon, Chair.     Yes, there are.  There are problems. The affidavits that should have been are not yet complete and therefore the witness that was to testify on Monday is unable to testify before seeing these affidavits and respond to those affidavits.As I was saying that the matter should not be... should we sit on Monday, should be postponed with another date. And then Chair, the arrangement we have reached is that the two affidavits should be filed within two weeks.One witness has promised to file the affidavit by end of next week.  The other one, we are hoping in two weeks’ time.  So and that ...[intervenes]      Well, Chair the one for next week, he wanted some extension from which we have received now and he said it will not take him more than a week now to finalise that.    Chair, actually when you look at whatthey need to consider ...[intervenes]      ...it should not be... it is not long affidavits.     A week should be enough.     And then the legal representatives of the witness who was going to testify next week, it will also take about a week to respond to those.    And then the matter will be then right for hearing.     And also the... remember Chair, it was also the hearing of the evidence of a witness and cross-examination of two witnesses who have testified.     The legal representatives of also of those two witnesses are here.    And then ...[intervenes]      Yes.       No, Chair there is nothing else Chair. 
MR WILLIS:   Good afternoon, Mr Chair.     [Indistinct]     My name is Willis.  I appear for Mr Wakeford.     Who is the witness who would give evidence before you and ...[intervenes]      That was when he last appeared.  So we confirmed what Mr Notshe has submitted to you Chair.     Mr Wirtz who appears for Mr Agrizzi.     It is.  The intention is to secure ...[indistinct] or two days in the very near future ...[intervenes]     ...just as soon as the various other administrative aspects can be finalised ...[intervenes]      ...in relation to the other affidavits.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, but it is generally two days we would finalise the matter.  One other aspect Mr Chairman is the correspondence that we have to address to you.  There are three questions on which we require yourdirection.  We will await those.     But everything else will be sooner.  We can ...[intervenes]      Indeed so.       Indeed.     Indeed.     Indeed so.     Indeed so.     There is to lead, yes.     On that day.     Chair, I will be ready to... whichever you decide.     The third aspect relates to the... I think theanswer to that one is the consolidation of the evidence but I believe that be of assistance to you in any event.     Yes, the bundles will be ...[intervenes]      The bundles will be common.     The other one is just a matter of consolidatinghis evidence.     Instead of working through the various affidavits.     Placing one affidavit before we ...[intervenes]      And that, we believe so too.     It will be done.  Thank you, Chair.     As you please.     Thank you, Chair. 
ADV WIRTZ:   Thank you, Chair.  Advocate Wirtz.  W-i-r-t-z.  I confirm that I appear on behalf of Mr Agrizzi, as well as MrLe Roux relating to the matter on Monday.  My learned friend, Advocate Notshe did phone me and told me there is a problem - not from our side or from Mr Wakeford’s side - certain documents and affidavits that are outstanding which are needed by all the parties.So we are waiting for those affidavits.  He has undertaken, as soon as they are given and as soon as Mr Wakeford’s counsel has responded, we will be able to respond within a day or two.So we are not going delay it.  We all area ready.  Mr Agrizzi was ready, Mr Le Roux was ready, and/or any others that might be needed that we represent.  And we have agreed that it can be postponed to a date to be fixed.  In regards to the days and the procedure, I am not sure whether you have received the correspondence from myinstructing attorney      And we have taken a certain stance and we will abide by the directives and by your decision.     We are not going to address you any further.     And we will abide from our side.     That is our position.  Thank you, Chair.    And if we can then be freed and also thank you to yourself and my learned friends who did indicate ...[intervenes]      ... the matter you are busy with and to let us impose so that we did not have to wait.     So we apologise and we thank them.     Thank you very much.     Thank you. 
GENERAL MAJOR MABULA:  Okay.    So I just wanted to just request to the Chair.    Brigadier Moyane – when we were called – I think all us, we are supposed to be charged.    Now he brought... we were consulting to that advocate in one room.  So as we were deliberating, that document was produced there.  It is wherenow it was quoted from here.  That is why then I cannot because I never actually possessed it.    It was read.    So because I was just said that, how do I say I never saw it but I call it here?  But when the Chair adjourned, he gave me an opportunity to go through.  Then I find my senses.    Yes.    Yes, because ...[intervenes]     H’m.    No.  Obviously, once it is quoted here, I would have seen it because I signed the document.     Yes.    It was almost the whole team.   Brigadier Ncube was there.  Kgorane was.  Colonel Reddy was there.  Dawood was there.  General Makhele was there and Brigadier Moyane was there.  I am not sure of DM, whether he was there.  This other guy who was present when did the briefing.    Yes.    Ja, Brigadier Moyane if my memory serves me well.  Because I have just made a mistake.  A big, big mistake.  Because I could not understand how.    Yes, if I recall very well.  Yes.    Page 65.    This here?    Yes.  Yes.  Ja.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Advocate Joubert.    No.  No, I think fright from the state attorneys we were referred to him.    I will try my best MrChairperson.    Page two...?    I would not know the date.     Chair, I cannot confirm and deny.  There were instances like exit.  Sometimes I had to meet with the National Commissioner.  So I cannot deny but I cannot specifically say yes on that day but if the record says that, then I met with him.    238.    Okay.    240, yes.    In Goudkop?    No, I do not stay in Goudkop.    I stay in...[intervenes]     Yes.   Chair, I will be the provincial commissioner responsible for all the investigations in North West Province.I am the Deputy to that ProvincialCommissioner.  The National Commissioner, whatever he has access to any Deputy Provincial Commissioner if there are official in that particular province.  I have met General Phahlane many times even beforethis investigation.  Then there were issues that allows me or he needs me to... but I do not know this one specific why I have met with him.  It is not a secret.  Every Regional Commissioner has the right and I cannot deny.  If it was a complaint or whatever task he wanted to give in terms of the position that I have, I am not to do that. 
GENERA MAJOR MABULA:  Yes. 
ADV JOUBERT SC:   Just three questions please.      Just three questions.     General to come back to the report in your warning statement I want to refer you to page 19 of Exhibit LE23.   So 19 and 20.     LEA 23.     19, from page 19 to 21 but more specifically on page 20 paragraph 8.     Now General this is an affidavit by Brigadier Moyane, LEA 23.  You are in the wrong bundle, LEA 23, just check.     Page 19, one nine.       That is a statement by Brigadier Moyane.    Now if you turn over the page to pagein paragraph 8, he makes the following statement.  He says the investigators came to the conclusion that the access to the former Acting National Commissioner ’sdwelling was spearheaded by Mr Paul O’Sullivan as it was also indicated that they initially acted as police officials, and then he says the following, and I think that goes back to your statement, they say I made a recommendation to the Acting Divisional Commissioner that the matter needs to be investigated further as it was a security breach.     So Mr Chair it appears that if this witness is called, he will confirm that because if one looks at that – that quotation it is a recommendation by BrigadierMoyane for further investigations.     Then further General will you confirm that from the outset of your investigations on the 30 t h of November 2016 this – the investigation and what flowed there from was at all relevant times directed and controlled by the office of the DPP Pretoria?    And what in the investigation flowed there from and whatever charges was subsequentlyinstituted against the suspects was the decision of the DPP Pretoria?     And then did you confirm that you and your team as police officers simply investigated adocket and placed the relevant information before the office of the DPP?     There was no reason to push any agenda of whatever sort?     Thank you Mr Chairperson.     Just on the – did you at any stage influence any person and more specific Mr Sibisiso William Zongu to change any evidence to implicate General Booysen in any matter?     That was just the one aspect.     Yes, yes Chair.     Mr McBride I want to be as brief as possible.   You confirm that you were suspended for various reasons, as IPID head as from 24/25 March 2015 to6 September 2016, a period of 18 months, is that correct?     19 October.     Very well, you formed certain views about the North West  team that investigated the security breach, which they investigated of General Phahlane?      So your view is based that they pushed some or other agenda to either eliminate IPID in their investigation?     Ja, well since their investigation commenced in November 2016 the investigation by IPID against their unit was revived, because a lot of old cases from about 2012/2013 which was really let’s say either – did not result in any firm decisions, thus all of the sevenrevised by IPID in 2017, is that correct?     Is it fair to state objectively, only objectively, that in mid-2017 there was a far more serious effort, let’s put it no wider than that, by IPID and more specific Mr Rapesho, to re – to give more attention to matters of theirs and for decisions to prosecute them, because as an objective fact that can be established?     Ja, but in comparison let us say with the previous efforts all of a sudden in mid-17 there was a renewed effort.   Is that a coincidence, because that is after they investigated, which culminated in the arrests in February of your two IPID members, Mr Mahlanga and ...[indistinct] and Sarah-Jane Trent and O’Sullivan, Mr O’Sullivan.    Ja, would you then also agree that the toing and froing in the investigations between IPID and the police of each other culminated in the eventual application and decision before the Honourable Judge Tuchten in the High Court in June 2018, where he remarked that you now either side or both sides should not investigate matters where they have a personal interest.      Ja.     Ja, the Judge was very disappointed in the conflict between the SAPS and IPID and in paragraph 13 he inter alia remarked as follows, and it is a    There is a lot of disappointment against you, Mr McBride, because they say subsequent to this judgment you try to elevate it in the press to a much higher standard, that there was in actual fact a victory for IPID rather than the police.   So – if I may just finish.  So my instructions are that you created specifically the impression in the press to paint the members of the SAPS in this unit in the worst possible light that you could.       Very well.  Mr McBride are you prepared to accept that their investigation, that is from the30 t h of November was at all relevant times under the prosecutorial control of the DPP in Pretoria, more specifically Advocate Mashoega who was immediately in court after the arrests and before Nemaorane who guided them in their prosecutorial guided investigation?    Ja, if that is so will you then acceptfor purposes of this inquiry that they were at all relevant times monitored and that they did not push their own agenda?      Who was the complainant in the investigation IPID commenced against General Pashlane?      Paul O’Sullivan and Paul O’Sullivan, if I look at his affidavit, and I may be mistaken, he decided as I understand his explanation to this Commission, he decided that he want to pay more attention t General Pashlane and he commenced to do his own what we call alifestyle audit.     But in this instance he had a more personal interest, he is the complainant.      Ja, there is an old saying which says that he who angers you controls you and I think he pushes that agenda very effectively because when you anger people you control them in his view.     That was just a – Mr McBride your agreement must have been that as a result of the wide tyres IPID investigators have, or they should do their investigations and which are very important, primarily against police officers who don’t always toe the line,should do that independently, transparently and objectively.     Ordinarily complainants don’t get involved in that investigations, because they should lay their complaint, they should make an affidavit under oath, a docket or an inquiry docket should be opened and from there on it is the duty of your investigators to do their work or their job in accordance with the transparent protocol. MR     Now in reading all the allegations I find it very hard to understand why was it necessary for Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Sarah-Jane Trent to accompany the two investigators when they decided to visit the house of General Pashlane in Stable Hills?   From an objective point of view there just appear to be no reasonable and acceptable explanation for them to work so closely together to IPID investigators, because they didn’t need apointing person, they didn’t need to point out a house, all that information could have objective obtained by the two IPID] investigators.     Okay, that’s ...[intervenes]      Again, looking at it from an outsider ’s point of view there just appears to be no reasonableexplanation for both Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Trent to have been involved so closely and consistently and even drafting statements of witnesses.  Ordinarily complainants don’t do that Mr McBride. 
MR MCBRIDE:  Well there have been instances where I have had to intervene and it was an uncomfortable situation because they had provided assistance.  But in fairness to the investigators and to O’Sullivan and Trent there is anexplanation which they give in their affidavits as to how they came to be together in one car at that specific time.  So I think once I acknowledge that there was perhaps too much assistance if I can put it that way, they have explained the circumstances in which this – in which this happened.  So to – I mean from the outside view there has been and some people have commented the over involvement and too much assistance.    Chair I would agree with you except to add that in this particular case the police themselves the complainants against Mr Phahlane had gone to O’Sullivan first.      And had made statements O’Sullivan already have statements from police officers.    And as early as 2013 long before I arrived at IPID he had received statements I think it is – off the top of my head I think it is Munsamy.    Colonel Munsamy I think he is in East London now.      And there was even an article in the newspapers in the Sowetan during that period.  So the issue was and then O’Sullivan became the complainant and he wasa complainant with most of the information.  And the complaint was laid in my absence and upon my return he decided to ask where is the complaint?      And the person who investigated was initiallywas Mandla Mahlangu and other people I cannot remember who it was.    And so the case was given to Mandla to handle.  At that stage one must remember that Mr Sesoko was not there.  He was still suspended.  Mr Khuba was not there.  And I relied on them a lot for some of this specialist investigations.    So yes O’Sullivan and his team assisted alot.  The key reason is not – is more than just specific aspects related to this case.  It is an issue of funding.  If you want IPID to be independent make independent – make sure it has enough funding.  So it is not forced to rely on anybody else.  The alternative to other help is actually asking help from the police which denudes the idea of independence.  So one has to look at those situational problems.     Well there is a few things you have put your – in one shot so I will try and deal with them one at a time.    So Chair if it is the – the issue is indeed there was a user perception of over reach and overinvolvement.  But the reason they do provide explanations and again I say in fairness and in reaching the truth of the matter is important to hear them out.  But it is an aspect on those allegations it is early in 2017 when these matters arose it is when Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko returned from – from being out of IPID and Mr Khuba was specifically tasked to deal with this issue and in addition to that Chair we requested assistance of DPCI so that any element of bias from our side is removed from the equation and General – and Colonel Roelofse was brought in to assist IPID in thisinvestigation and he is still helping with this investigation.  Indeed, it is the investigation which has actually brought General Phahlane to court on charges of corruption and O’Sullivan had and his team had nothing to do with that investigation whatsoever.  So as we are aware that GeneralPhahlane and I think four other generals are actually on trial at the moment.    Yes.    Indeed, also the perception of bias must be removed.    Well as I explained earlier, they will explain but the issue – a lot of the information required is public information and it is information that ordinarily we would have the facilities ourselves.Because of budgetary problems we do not have the facility and indeed it is the budgetary problems that force us to seek assistance outside.  So to answer your question in ideal circumstances or more improved circumstances that situation would not arise.    Well the issues they were assisting with the investigation from what I hear were – I think it is importantthat you speak to the investigators themselves.  O’Sullivan and Trent themselves.    Well look I am in a position of authority to discuss the state of the police services.   I responded to your question Chair.  I mean I responded to the question.    Thank you.
