CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning everybody.    Yes.    Good morning Mr Mkwanazi.  Thank you for coming back to the commission even though virtually but I think you are not testifying for the first time.    Yes. Thank you.  Okay Mr Myburgh.  Yes thank you Chairperson.  As you know our next witness is Mr Mkwanazi he is going to be giving evidence via Zoom.    Yes just one second Mr Myburgh.  Where is this – that other light that is usually there? I think there would be two.  I do not know I see it is a little dark but maybe I should not be concerned about it.  But – ja well the technicians – the people who – who deal with it know what I am talking about.  I think they will attend to it.  Okay Mr Myburgh.    Hm.    Oh okay alright.    Well I am happy with the arrangement I am just realising that you will be looking there – I will be – I wonder whether it was not possible to have this somewhere there where we could both see him.  But it is not a big deal if you …    Oh is that so.    Okay let us stick to this so long ja.    Oh okay.    Okay no that is fine.  That is fine.      I am sorry.  I think the reception is quite poor I cannot hear the speaker.      Yes.    Oh yes it is Mr Mkwanazi the lawyer?    Yes.  No thank you very much.  I do not know what it is but when you speak it is not as clear as it ought to be.  I mention that so that when next time there is a need for you to speak hopefully whatever it is that may need to be attended to – will help being attended to.    Ja.  I hope Mr Mkwanazi will be clear when he speaks.  Mr Mkwanazi can you hear me?    Yes okay it looks like we can hear him.  Okay Mr Myburgh.    Oh – administer the oath or affirmation first.    Ja.  So.    Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath?    I see you took off your jacket Mr Mkwanazi is it too hot where you are?    Ja I think put it on if you do not mind.    I was wondering – I was wondering whether you took your jacket off because it was already hot there or whether it was antici – in anticipation of eats.    Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    What…    What – I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  On the spine the first writing should be Transnet Bundle 04A.  Is that correct Mr Myburgh?    Ja and then below that it says Exhibit BB18.  Have you got the correct one Mr Mkwanazi?    Ja no, no it is the right one.    Ja it is the right one.    I am sorry.  Is there a possibility that you might be mistaken with regard to the month and that the month might be November?    The reason I am raising that question is that in October 2010 Mr Gigaba was not Minister of Public Enterprises as yet it was still Ms Barbara Hogan.  And she was dropped from cabinet on the 31 October 2010.  That is the evidence she gave.  And her – and Mr Gigaba’s appointment was announced – would have been announced probably on the 31 October or 1 November.  So he – he only became Minister of Public Enterprises from 1 November. So I am – I am wondering whether it might be October or whether it might be November?    Sometime in October.    Ja.    He – he – well we have got an affidavit from him but I do not think it says anything about any date of your meeting.    But I may be mistaken.  But of course – of course it is maybe possible that maybe if he had been informed already before the end of October maybe confidentially that he would be taking over.  Maybe he could start looking at matters that he thought they were urgent I am not sure.  But anyway your recollection is that it was in October?    Yes okay thank you. ADV MYBURGH     I am sorry.  Did you try and find out whether he had at any stage applied for condonation?     Now, is it not the position that an employee who seeks condonation must request condonation or apply for condonation?     Now Mr Gama was a very senior employee in the company.       He, from what I understand and from what I heard in the past few days about TFR at Transnet, it seems that TFR, it was the largest division at Transnet.       Is that correct?     So we are talking here about somebody who was employed as CEO of the largest division within cabinet... within Transnet.       You are talking about somebody who was leading his division with a lot of people, employees and other managerial under him, who is supposed to have... to have had knowledge of these policies and processes we are talking about.  Is that not so?     Because he would be needed... his job needed him to even guide those under him about... on these policies, is it not?     Therefore, you are dealing with somebody whom you are supposed to expect to have known of the existence of this condonation process and that an employee can apply for it if the employee wishes it to be evoked.  Is that right?     And if he did not apply for it, there may be no reason why you or the board should bother to come to his assistance when he elected not to use it when he knew about it, is it not?     You accept that?     Yes.  So the question that arises is that when the issue of condonation arose within the context of his dismissal dispute. I would have expected your attitude, as well as the     H’m.     No, no.  I accept that you do not know whether he did or he did not.     But that is part of my question because I am saying.  Since you knew as the board that you are dealing with an executive who ought to know the company policies and so on.   When this issue of condonation was raised in the context of his dismissal.  My expectation is that the first reaction     Yes, but maybe I am not articulating my concern as clearly as I should.  You... I accept that you say you do not know whether he did apply for condonation.   I accept that you say that you did not investigate that issue.  I accept for present purposes that you think KPMG maybe should have looked into that issue.   My issue is.  My expectation is that before you went to look into any number of previous cases where condonation had been granted, I would have expected you and the board     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     H’m.  Yes.     Yes.  Okay no, that is fine.  My Myburgh.     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh.  Please do not forget your line of thought.     there is something that I should have asked later... earlier but I thought I would ask later but I think I will canvas it now.   Mr Mkwanazi, if... I think we can accept that Mr Gama did not apply for condonation.  Are you prepared to accept that or you think he probably did or you think he may or may not?   I think by now we would have known if he had applied for condonation.  By the.. he... there was a lengthy disciplinary process.  You remember that?     At which he was represented, not just by an attorney, as I understand the position, by even senior counsel.  You remember that?     And that disciplinary hearing, I am told, the actual hearing took 14-days.  And when you read the rulings of the chairperson, you can see that the matters were dealt with extensively.  Now do you think that Mr Gama, if he had applied for condonation, he would not have told his lawyers that he applied for condonation and it was granted if it was like that ...[intervenes]      ...or it was refused, if it was refused?  He would have known?       Yes.     Ja, it is anticipated that he would not have mentioned that he did apply for it, is it not?     Ja.  So we can accept that he did not apply for it.  And actually, you do know, do you not, that the issue of condonation was raised at the disciplinary hearing by his lawyers.  You know that?     So the lawyers would have dealt with all of those issues and they would have said he applied for condonation and if he was granted condonation, they would have said that.  We would be knowing it from the ruling of the chairperson.   Or if he was refused condonation and they thought he was unfairly refused, they would have told the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry.  You accept that?     So he did not apply for condonation, okay?  And if... and you either knew that he did not apply or if you did not know, to get to know would have been the easiest thing, is it not, to find out, did he apply?  One way is to ask him or ask his lawyers.  You accept that?     Yes.  Now, as I understand your affidavit.  The door that you or the board used in order to get to reinstate him is to say Mr Gama was not offered the opportunity of a condonation.  Is that... am I right?     Yes.  Now, if... is it fair to put it that way, when you are dealing with an executive like Mr Gama because he did not need to be offered condonation?  He knew there was this process.  He knew he could apply for it.  And he elected, for whatever reason, not to apply for that.  You accept that, do you not?     And if there is any unfairness arising from that, it would be an unfairness that he brought it upon himself by deciding not apply for that process, is it not?  You accept that?     You accept that?     Once you accept that there was nothing unfair about him not having been offered the opportunity of condonation because he knew he could apply.  He elected for reasons known to himself not to apply.  Then, is it not the position that then there is no sympathy for him?  There ought to be no sympathy for him.       H’m.     But he cannot blame anybody and the board cannot and should not have relied on that to feel any sympathy for him because this is a senior executive.  He knows the policies of the organisation.  He knows these processes.   And at the time, or after he had been told that he was going to face a disciplinary inquiry, he employed lawyers including senior counsel.  He had no disadvantage in dealing with these charges.  He had the advantage of a legal team at his disposal to advise him.   Therefore, the board – that is what I am putting to you – had... did not have grounds based on condonation to feel any sympathy for him.  What do you say ?     Yes but all I am simply saying is, insofar as Mr Gama may have been complaining that his dismissal was unfair because of condonation, the board had no grounds to rely on condonation to come to his assistance in circumstances where he had elected, in circumstances where he had elected not to invoke that process.  You accept that?     Okay, Mr Myburgh?     And he was their senior.  You remember that?     He says was the CEO of TFR.     He was Chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry relating to those two employees.     You never read it?     But one would have expected that when you dealt with Mr Gama’s matter the fact that two employees who were under him had been dismissed in connection with one of the tenders, for which he was dismissed, I would have expected that you would have been informed of that.     Yes.  Did you only get to know about them much later?     Yes, okay.     When you got to know about these two employees who were dismissed who were under Mr Gama would it have been a few months after Mr Gama had come back or are you not able to indicate?     Yes.  Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     But – well, let me just clarify something.  This concept of condonation within Transnet, it did not mean that if condonation was granted the employee would not be disciplined, is that correct?     Indeed you have testified that in respect of some of the condonations that the board dealt with in 11 you specifically, as the board, instructed the Group CEO Mr Molefe to take disciplinary action against certain managers, is that right?     Now I must confess that when I first read – or for some time after reading about this point of condonation, I thought that what it meant was if condonation is granted it means that whatever misconduct the employee may have committed in connection with that procurement will not lead to disciplinary action but Mr Todd’s evidence and his affidavit made the distinction and I think your evidence seems to be in line with his to say condonation does not mean that you are not going to be disciplined, is that right?     No my difficulty then is what then is the relevance of condonation where the issue is whether the employee was dismissed fairly or not.  Why is condonation a relevant factor?     Well, I do not understand.  If the policy of the company is that employees may not do a, b, c, d and if they do a, b, c, d they will be disciplined and the disciplinary process could lead to their dismissal.     And an employee is alleged to have committed that misconduct or acts of misconduct, a, b, c, d…     And a disciplinary process is then instituted, the employee, as I understand your evidence, cannot say as a defence to the charges or charges against him, I have been condoned or my noncompliance with the procedures has been condoned, is it not?  That is not a defence to the charge.     So if it is not a defence to the charge, why is it relevant to the question of whether the sanction that gets imposed on the employee at the end of the disciplinary process for misconduct, a, b, c, d was fair?     You see – because part of what I am trying to understand and Mr Myburgh is also trying to do the same, is the reasoning of the board in deciding to reinstate him because when one looks at the charges of which he was found guilty, I do not know in your mind but in my mind they are very serious for a senior executive in the position in which he was, so -.and when you look at the rulings of the Chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry both in regard to whether he was guilty of these charges or not and in regard to the sanction, they are very thorough, they are very, very detailed and then you can see that the Chairperson took care to consider the evidence and the arguments very carefully, you know? And this was an independent Chairperson, it was not somebody who might have been involved in any  - maybe factions within Transnet, if there were factions.  But it was somebody who was independent, a senior member of the bar. So you then say but how could the board decide that this person must be reinstated?  So you look for their reasoning and central to the board’s reasoning is the condonation process.  So because that is central to the board’s reasoning as to why they reinstated Mr Gama, once you say to me condonation does not mean that the employee’s misconduct is condoned and he cannot be disciplined anymore, then I say but what was the relevance of condonation then because you have accepted that it was not a defence, it could not be a defence.  You cannot say when you are charged for misconduct arising out of procurement processes and say well, I have been granted condonation so you cannot charge me anymore.   So help me understand where it is relevant because it is not relevant to the issue of guilt, is it not?  It is not relevant to the question whether the employee is guilty of the charges.  Is that right?    You see, for me, once you say condonation does not mean that any allegations of misconduct or any misconduct by the employees condoned it actually means that those who have the power to make the decision whether the employee is charged or not, they must do their job.  What outcome happens, that outcome will happen, okay?     Now so when you – if you then say to time, you know, found as a board that, you know, Mr Gama was not offered condonation, my reaction is and so what?  He was not offered condonation and so what?  That is my reaction.     Because I am saying condonation would not have changed anything.       If he was guilty of misconduct the disciplinary process would have led to him being found guilty and if the sanction of dismissal was found to be appropriate it would have been imposed irrespective of whether he was granted condonation or not.  You accept that, do you not?     So I go back to my question.  He was not offered condonation and so what?  That is my question because I do not see where it comes in.     But the fact of the matter is he did not apply and because he did not apply, he should not get the benefit that he may have got if he had applied.  If you want the benefits …[intervenes]     Yes, if you want the benefits of condonation, whatever they may be, you apply.     If you do not apply for condonation you do not get the benefits that come with condonation.  You accept that?     And, therefore, once the board accepted that he had not applied, it should not have sought to give him benefits of condonation that would only apply if he had applied.  You accept that now?     Yes.  So what I am saying is that the board should have sought to establish whether he applied.     And if it established that he did not apply, it should not have sought to give him the benefits of something that he did not apply for.  You accept that?     But I see we are at twenty fast past, shall we take the tea break?     Okay, alright, we will take the tea break for fifteen minutes we will resume at twenty to twelve.  We adjourn.     Okay let us continue Mr Myburgh.     Yes, he is talking about that letter.      I am sorry Mr Mkwanazi, Mr Myburgh you might wish to take him to the letter first.       And just highlight the specific issues and then we can deal with a respond.      I think Mr Myburgh is inviting you to look at your affidavit to see whether you do deal with the issues that he is raising with you.      Or maybe let us ask when did you think of the idea of the supplementary affidavit?      Oh but quite some time after you had delivered this one to the Commission?      Okay, alright Mr Myburgh.      I am sorry Mr Myburgh which bundle?      Bundle 2, yes okay.      He was fired on the 29 t h of June?     Yes.      I am sorry; do you mean that even if a Minister is not a Minister of Public Enterprises very often they have people within the different SOE’s that maybe tell them some of the matters that are going on in those SOE’s or what?          They have a lot of interest in the SOE’s?     Yes.          Yes, well obviously Mr Mkwanazi you see I am laughing.     So you, of course you were involved in different also or is it different times and in different capacities so I take it you know what you are talking about.  Is that right?        So you mean a lot of the Ministers would have companies and they would be looking at tender opportunities in the various SOE’s?     Yes, thank you.      Well when Ms Barbara Hogan gave evidence about the matter of Mr Gama she also did say that a number of politicians including Ministers went public while the process of recruiting of or appointing a Group CEO while it was underway and when there was talk of Mr Gama being suspended or being charged or when he had been suspended or was being charged there were some politicians who went public calling for Mr Gama to be appointed as the Group CEO and saying that the charges against him were unfair or were trumped up or were intended to prevent him from being appointed as a Group CEO of Transnet Ms Hogan have that evidence and I think at the time when she gave evidence a newspaper clippings were included in the bundle that was used.   And indeed I think there was a newspaper article where I think Mr Mantashe was said to have made statements as well supporting Mr Gama.  I think Minister Nyanda, General Nyanda I think he was Minister at the time he was also reported in some article to have also come out as well as Minister Radebe so that is in the public domain and it is before the Commission in terms of the bundles relating to Ms Hogan’s evidence so that part was referred to.        I think Mr Mkwanazi what Mr Myburgh is talking about is that you did not mention in the affidavit that he raised the issue of the Mr Gama.  You just said that he raised the issue of condonation from deviations.    Yes.    He was talking about the Gama matter under that.    Yes.  Oh okay.  Well I must say that            when I read your affidavit and I came to that because you did not refer to Mr Gama or his case as such.    I had a strong suspicion that he must have been talking to you about the Gama matter but you are now confirming that there he was talking about the Gama matter.  Is that right you are confirming that?    And he said that the – the sanction of dismissal in the Gama matter was too harsh or something – the words to that effect.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    yes.    Yes.  When he referred to the issue of condonation of the condonation process or a condonation process at Transnet under that 4.3.4 was he saying that condonation had not been used in regard to Mr Gama and that should be looked into?    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Did – and when he said the sanction of dismissal in Mr Gama’s case was too harsh.    Oh.    Yes.  When he spoke to you did he have that documentation with him or he was just referring to it because he knew it?    Oh okay.    Oh.    Oh okay. But he – so what was he basing his view on that the sanction of dismissal in Mr Gama’s case was too harsh as you recall?  What was he basing it on?  On the racial issue?    Yes.  Okay and black executives would be dismissed for less serious.    Yes.  And – okay alright.  But all of these matters that you set out under 4.3 that is 4.3.1 up to 4.3.4 were matters that he was asking you as the….    Person he was offering the position of chairperson of the board he was asking you to look into seriously at Transnet?    As a board yes, yes.    Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    You did not ask him?  Or he did not offer?    Yes.    Okay.      Well the one thing which you have said Mr Mkwanazi is that Mr Gigaba did say that the sanction of dismissal against Mr Gama was too harsh, is that correct?    Or was harsh?    It was unfair.    Yes.  Now based on what he said to you which you understood to be the grounds for him thinking it was unfair – from what you said to me it seemed clear that he – it was implied that he thought that Mr Gama should not have been dismissed.  Would you agree with that?    Yes, no, no.  All I am saying…    All I am simply saying is that based on his discussion with you.    In regard to the matter of Mr Gama it seems that it was implied that his view was that Mr Gama should not have been dismissed because you said he referred to – he said white executives do more serious – commit more serious acts of misconduct and do not get dismissed but black executives get dismissed even if they have done something less serious.    No, no.  No. MR    Hang on, hang on.  I just want to make sure we understand.  You have not said to me that he said Mr – he expressly said Mr Gama should not have been dismissed.  You have not said that.  Okay.      And I understand that you have not said that but what I am putting to you is what seems to me to be what was implied.  But you must – once I put the proposition to you you will indicate if you say you do not share my thinking that it was implied.  My…    My – my thinking is that if he says the dismissal was harsh or was unfair because – and he advances as the reason that white executives do not get dismissed even when they have done or committed more serious offences.  It seems to me that he was saying if Mr Gama was a white executive he would not have been dismissed.  That seems to be implied to me.  Do you think I am being fair to him?    Yes.  No but at this stage I just want us to stay with what we make of what he said to you that is Mr Gigaba.    So I understood you to be saying you agree with my interpretation of what seems to be implied.    Yes.  You agree with that?    Okay alright.    Okay.  Mr Myburgh.    I just wanted to say I had also thought Mr Mkwanazi had used harsh or too harsh earlier on but I may be mistaken.    Yes.    Okay.    I am sorry.    Mr Myburgh please do not forget.    What you have in mind.  Let me go back to this issue of harsh.  Mr Mkwanazi – there can be no doubt can there by that Mr Gigaba must have thought that Mr – the sanction of dismissal against Mr Gama was too harsh.    Because his – because the statement he made to you when he said whites commit more serious acts of misconduct and do not get dismissed.  In the context it could only have made that – he thought that dismissal was too harsh.    You agree?    Yes okay alright.    But somewhere in around December 10, 13 or thereabout?    Ja.    Okay.    What page?    Okay.    I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  You made a certain point about the use of the sanction being too harsh a few minutes ago.  I just want to follow up on that before you proceed.    Otherwise I forget.  Mr Mkwanazi Mr Myburgh just asked you a few minutes ago whether it was coincidental that you said earlier on that Mr Gigaba said the sanction of dismissal was too harsh and we know that later on you said no he said it was unfair.  But he was asking you…    Ja.    Ja you said that afterwards.  He was asking whether it was just coincidental that the board also used the same terminology.  You have responded to that I am not asking you to respond to that one.  I want to put this to you that…oh you want to say something?    Yes, ja.  Say it.    Oh okay alright.  No I want to say when I saw that paragraph 4.3.4 of your affidavit where you say – where you say – have you lost connection?  Mr Mkwanazi.    Oh okay.  I just want you to get settled.      Ja that is the one we were use – we were referring to.    Ja.      So where you said one of the issues that the Minister asked your board to look into was the issue of condonation processes in relation to procurement matters, deviations and so on.      So – so I found it interesting that one of the issues Mr Gigaba raised at that first meeting was this issue of condonation from deviation in procurement processes at Transnet.   And the basis on which the board ultimately reinstated Mr Gama was condonation as well.  Do you want to say something on that?    Yes but what my context was here is Mr Gigaba meeting with you – the first meeting he has with you where he offers you the position of Chairperson of the board of Transnet and conveys to you issues that he must have seen as issues of priority that your board should look at.  He raises this issue of condonation and of course you have now confirmed that he did discuss the Gama matter with you and then a few months later the board.    A few months later the board uses condonation to actually justify its decision to reinstate Mr Gama.  So there seems to be a connection in my mind between his suggestion of condonation and the reinstatement.  You agree?    There is a link.  Okay thank you.  Mr Myburgh.    You want to say something Mr Mkwanazi?    Oh okay.  I thought you – there was something you wanted to add.  Okay Mr Myburgh.    Just wait for me Mr Myburgh.    I have not received the bundle yet.  Yes you may proceed.     Before you proceed Mr Myburgh.  You say Mr Mkwanazi he asked you to or he thought that he... he said that the process, the disciplinary process had been unfair but you say ...[intervenes]      ...what he put, what he told you in support of that was how white executives were treated ...[intervenes]      Yes, he racialised, ja.     Now, as I see it, that has got nothing to do with the process as such.  Of course, he might have put it that way.  I, obviously, I was not there.  I do not know.   So you know, a process really is about whether the procedure which was followed was fair.  That is the process.   But it seems to me that as if his complaint was that white executives were treated favourable, black executives were treated less favourable in relation to disciplinary matters, it went to the substance of the dismissal.   You might be able to say yes.  You might not be able to say yes.  But I am just putting to you what... it looks like the reference to process might be a wrong terminology.       Yes.  Because it is not about whether he was given a reasonable notice as to when the disciplinary hearing will start.  It is not about whether he was given enough time to give his evidence at the hearing.   It is not about whether he was given enough time to cross-examine witnesses who were implicating him.  It is not about whether he was allowed to call witnesses.  It is not about that.   It is simply to say you are treating black executives less favourable compared to white executives when it comes to disciplinary matters.     Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.     Sorry.  One second Mr Myburgh.  I had wanted to go back to that, the issue you have just touched upon, Mr Mkwanazi.  I wanted to ask you the question whether at the time you were meeting with him, your recollection is that you were meeting the... somebody who was Minister of Public Enterprises already ...[intervenes]      Oh, is your recollection that ...[intervenes]      You were under that impression?  But ...[intervenes]      Oh, okay alright.  Okay.  Thank you. ADV MYBURGH     When you met with Minister Gigaba in that October meeting, Mr Mkwanazi.  Are you able to remember whether he may have said to you that he had a meeting with Mr Gama or he had... or Mr Gama had discussed with him his matter?  Or is that something you do not remember?     Yes, okay alright.     Or that the instruction came from higher up.     H’m.     Well, he did say that as well.  So that you... the two of you ended up being quite close.  So he is right about that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, before Mr Myburgh continues.  I note that in paragraph 8, you did not take issue with Mr Mapoma’s statement where he said, you said you wanted to find a way to do so cleanly.  So you took issue with his use of the word instructed.  And of course, his assumption that you had been instructed by former President Zuma.       So you might have passed that part of     Yes, okay.  So where he says, you said you wanted to do this cleanly.  You have no problem with that as long as it is understood that cleanly refers to ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.     I am sorry Mr Myburgh.       I thought you were... I was watching whether you are going to take this up.  Mr Mkwanazi, just now you also said what you were instructed to do was to review.  So I think that we can accept that you are saying whatever it is you were to do, it was a result of an instruction.  Is that correct?     Yes, okay.  So your query is.  It was not... it was not an instruction reinstate Mr Gama?     It was instruction to review his case?     Okay alright.  Thank you.     So I take it that - and you must tell me if I misunderstand your evidence – I take it that as you give evidence today, you are able to answer that question which     ...a member of cabinet influenced the settlement.     Yes.     Yes.  No, I ...[intervenes]      No, no.  I understand that part.  I am just basically putting to you the question that was in the letter.  Is there a cabinet member who influenced the settlement?     Oh, yes, ja.  Thank you, Mr Myburgh.     No, no.  I do not have anything.     Oh, yes.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn.     Continue.     Of the same bundle?     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, my attention was on some other page on another bundle.  Just remind me the page on this bundle?     178?     Of...?     I am sorry, you said you read from what bullet point?     Oh, okay.  Thank you.     Well, when you say that what Mr Mahlangu says in that second bullet point was premature are you saying that what he says was the position at that time was not the position or are you saying it may have been the position or was the position but that was not the right time for him to start telling the minister about it?     But, Mr Mkwanazi, how could he just say to his minister, who is Minister of Public Enterprises and to the extent that you say the minister, Mr Gigaba, had instructed you to review Mr Gama’s case - to the extent that that is so or maybe so, then it would be likely that Mr Mahlangu would know about that.   Now if he then reports to his minister on the 18 January, that he understood that Transnet was nearing a settlement with Mr Gama and if that was not the position, why would he just get – decide to tell his minister something that he had no basis for?  What would be his interest in telling the minister that he understood that a settlement was looming if actually …[intervenes]     That was not in the …[intervenes]     Yes.  And Mr Mahlangu himself, had you had a discussion with him before this date about the Gama matter whether in a meeting or in a telephone conversation?     Yes but what I am talking about, prior to the 18 January had you had any discussion with Mr Mahlangu whether in a meeting or in a telephone conversation about the Gama matter?     Might have.     Yes, okay.  Did he phone you quite regularly, Mr Mahlangu, by any chance?     And would he ask about Mr Gama’s matter sometimes?     Okay, okay, alright.  Thank you.  At the date of the 18 January, that is the date on which he was writing to the minister...     Do you recall whether you had done quite some homework on this Gama matter?  Remember, the minister had raised it with you for this first time in October of 2010?  We are now about mid-January.  Do you recall whether you had done quite some work to try and understand what the issues were and to form a view one way or another as to whether this unfairness that the minister was talking about in October might be well-founded or not?      You talk about reports that you had asked for and had reached you?     Ja.     Yes.     And by that time you would have read some of them, some of those reports?     Oh, okay.     Ja.     Yes.  So do you recall whether by mid-January you might have formed a view on your own on whether there was some unfairness on Mr Gama’s dismissal even if that was not based on legal advice, just for you own sense of fairness?  Do you remember whether you might have got to that point?     Oh, okay.     Okay.     Okay, okay.     Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh?     Just one sec before you move on, Mr Myburgh.  Mr Mkwanazi, I asked you about ten minutes ago about whether Mr Mahlangu did regularly call you …[intervenes]     And whether he discussed Mr Gama’s matter and you said yes, you did.  Now Mr Mapoma gave evidence and said that Mr Mahlangu did also call him about the Gama matter.     And he said he called him twice.  He said in the first telephone conversation he was not pressurising him to do anything but he was enquiring about progress in the Gama matter.     But he says when he called him for the second time, Mr Mahlangu was definitely putting pressure on him saying that Transnet was delaying or he, Mr Mahlangu, was delaying the reinstatement of Mr Gama or the settlement, I am not sure, but he said he put pressure on him and he had to be firm with him and tell him that he must stop doing that.  He was not reporting to him or the minister and he says he reported this to you, I do not know whether the following morning, because he suspected that Mr Mahlangu might tell the minister and the minister might call you.   Do you recall him have mentioned – or having received any calls from Mr Mahlangu about the Gama matter?     No, no, no, not Mr Mahlangu.  My question was whether you have any recollection of Mr Mapoma reporting to you or mentioning to you that Mr Mahlangu had called him about the Gama matter and they are trying to put pressure on him and he had to talk firmly to him.     Do not recall, okay, alright.     Yes.     Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Mr Myburgh?     Maybe before that Mr Myburgh can I just go back to the issue of stopping the execution.  Mr Mkwanazi the process that you instructed Bowman Gilfillan Attorneys to stop that is the process of recovering from Mr Gama legal costs that the High Court had ordered him to pay to Transnet, that process could not possibly have anything to do with whether Mr Gama’s dismissal was fair or not.  That was – that order which was made in favour of Transnet by a High Court Judge was an order made because the High Court concluded that when Mr Gama launched an application to the High Court seeking a certain order against Transnet and the directors he had no proper grounds he had no case, that is why the High Court dismissed his application and ordered him to pay costs in favour of Transnet and its directors.  That was an application which happened before the disciplinary hearing began.  So I cannot see how it could have had any bearing on whether his dismissal was fair or not.  Are you able to see that it could have had some bearing?     Yes, yes, of course maybe in your favour I can say that at this stage we are talking about what seems to have been an instruction to temporarily stop that process so that might – well maybe up to a certain level one can understand if you said I didn’t understand what is going on, maybe let it stop, but when you later on then don’t say continue that is what we will deal with in due course.  Mr Myburgh?     Ja, the reception is very poor when you speak Mr Mkwanazi, the lawyer.     Ja, I cannot hear, I hear you are asking for something but I don’t hear what it is you are asking for.     Were you asking for a break?     Oh, okay alright, Mr Myburgh?     Let us take a five minute break, okay we will take a five minute adjournment, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     That suggests Mr Mkwanazi that at that time you had come to the conclusion that if at all possible you would like to bring Mr Gama back to Transnet, is that fair comment to say that – that looks like that was your attitude.        So you did not think that he had been unfairly found guilty of the acts of misconduct of which he was found guilty, you had no problem with that.     The process was also fair.     Yes, so save for these other cases you were comfortable that Mr Gama’s sanction of dismissal was fair?     Yes, yes, ja.  Okay Mr Myburgh?     Do you remember the two employees who worked under Mr Gama.     Yes, we talked about them earlier.     But Mr Myburgh asked you earlier before lunch the question if you saw that some of the employees had been dismissed just like Mr Gama, but you realised that there were others who had not been dismissed, why is it that your attitude was not to say then the others the ones who were not dismissed should also be dismissed, should also be dismissed because it is wrong that they were not dismissed for such a thing.  Why was your attitude that we must condone these serious acts of misconduct and allow Mr Gama back?      I am sorry, sorry, ...[intervenes]      I am sorry Mr Mkwanazi I am sorry, I think my use of the word condone is going to confuse you, let me rephrase my question.        Mr Myburgh’s question before lunch one of his questions was if you realised that in some cases dismissals had been effected but in others no dismissals had happened and indeed I think you say in some not even a warning, but in ...[intervenes]      ...Mr Gama’s case there was a dismissal and there were some where there may have been a dismissal.  Why didn’t you say what is wrong here is Transnet’s failure to dismiss these other employees, that is what is wrong.  What is wrong is not its dismissal of Mr Gama, what is wrong is its failure to dismiss the others because what they were guilty of was serious.     Mr Myburgh?     I think and the Board ...[intervenes]      Well while Mr Myburgh is looking for something let me go back to an issue that he has dealt with, with regard to one on one meetings between yourself and Mr Gama, how many such meetings did you have with Mr Gama?     Well he – I have been under the impression when I read his statement that there had been two such occasions but when he gave his evidence he said no there was only one, namely he said the Inanda one, I think which I think is when Deneys Reitz Attorneys were also present. Is it your recollection also that ...[intervenes]      Yes, now when Mr Myburgh asked you why you excluded other people from that meeting and met Mr Gama alone you say that it was Mr Gama who had discomfort in meeting with you together with other people, is that correct?     So he had asked that he wanted to meet you alone?     Did you ever ask him why he did not want even your lawyers to be present.  I don’t understand what should make him uncomfortable because you have lawyers to advise you, he has got lawyers to advise him, if you are going to talk settlements both of you need legal advice, so why should they not be present?  Did you ask him?     Yes, but really if you negotiate the settlements in a legal dispute that is happening in a public forum like a Bargaining Council I am not sure that you would be so concerned about that, because in any event you know you hold your discussions until you sign there is no settlement.  I just find it strange that there were these, there was this one on one meeting, particularly when the attorneys were around and you needed advice, I take it he needed advice, his attorneys were around as well.  I mean what is it that was so secret that he wanted to talk about. That is my ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes.  Well maybe Mr Myburgh is still going to ask you further about the content of the discussion but I heard from Mr Mapoma that you reported to him after that one on one meeting with Mr Gama that the two of you could not reach agreement, because Mr Gama instead of asking to be reinstated in the position from which he was dismissed actually wanted you to agree that he would be appointed to the position of Group Chief Executive Officer of Transnet, is that true?      Well no I don’t think he confused that because when he gave evidence he was clear because I even said – asked him, I said but Mr Gama had been dismissed from the position of CEO of TFR.     Yes and he said yes but he – he said but Mr Mkwanazi told me that the reason why they didn’t agree is that he was now, he now wanted to be appointed as – or he used the word reinstated, reinstated as Group Chief Executive Officer and Mr Mkwanazi said he rejected that, he wanted him to be reinstated to the position of CEO TFR, which is the position from which he had been dismissed, that is what he said.     Yes, yes, so is the position that you are not sure whether Mr Gama made this demand to be appointed to ...[intervenes]       You are not sure okay, alright.     Yes about that you are clear.     Yes, thank you Mr Myburgh.     Okay, I am just getting there.   Yes Mr Myburgh.     Advocate Myburgh you are spot on but there is a – it is a consequential thing.    In other words Mr Mkwanazi.    What Mr Myburgh is saying.    When you were – when you were looking at this issue you and the board and you sought to rely on condonation.    You said Mr Gama was not afforded the opportunity of using condonation.  That could only apply to the other charges not this one.  So that being the case you ought to have said as the board, you see this idea that Mr Gama was not afforded condonation – the opportunity to use condonation is not good enough to justify reinstating him.  Because that ground only applies to two of the acts of misconduct of which he has been found guilty.  It cannot apply to this third one.   And yet this third one is on its own so serious that a dismissal is appropriate.  Therefore you as the board ought to have said no we cannot find our way to reinstating Mr Gama because even if we were to use condonation there is this other act of misconduct to which condonation does not apply and it is an obstacle to us reinstating him.   That is what Mr Myburgh is putting to you.  Why did you not adopt that approach?    I do have some questions Mr – but I want to allow you Mr Myburgh to take it further.    Mr Mkwanazi which attorneys poked holes into your case in the Transnet Bargaining Council?  Because Bowman Gilfillan said you had a very strong case.  I understand that Webber Wentzel said procedurally you had done everything properly and I have seen – I have seen a letter or letters from Deneys Reitz who said in relation to whether the dismissal was fair or not who say they also gave an opinion that this dismissal was fair.  So which attorneys poked holes into your case that was going to arbitration?    Yes I think Mr Myburgh might take that…    That further but let me go back to this question.  I am concerned that you do not seem to be prepared to make the concession that I think Mr Myburgh thought you would make namely that the board should not have reinstated Mr Gama.  Is my understanding of your position correct?  Namely your stand is…    Okay alright.  Now my difficulty with that evidence is this.  Mr Gama was found guilty of three acts of misconduct and I think you and I agree that each one of those acts of misconduct were serious – or was serious.  I think we agree on that.  I think previously you have agreed to that, correct?    Yes.  You have also agreed or conceded to Mr Myburgh that the – the charge relating to the attacks by Mr Gama on the executives and the board was serious enough to deserve the sanction of dismissal on its own.  You remember that?      That you accepted that.  Now if you accept that what it means is that the chairperson of the inquiry relied on three grounds to say Mr Gama should be dismissed.  Now two of these grounds namely the acts of misconduct had something to do with procurement which is where condonation may apply okay?   But this other one had nothing to do with procurement and therefore condonation would not come in.  Why would you and your board not say, but why must we reinstate Mr Gama when there is this one ground, one conviction if you like which on its own is sufficiently serious to justify the sanction of dismissal?   Why must we take him back because we cannot – we cannot fault the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry for having concluded that he should be dismissed even if it was this act of misconduct alone?  Why do you not adopt that approach?  That is the approach I would have expected from a board or from somebody who says this third charge or fourth charge that has got nothing to do with procurement is sufficiently – or is serious enough on its own to justify dismissal.   So that is what my logic would say.  So you – you would – I would go back to the Minister – I would go back to Mr Gama and say you may have had a case on the basis of the two serious acts of misconduct that are connected with procurement if those were the only acts of misconduct of which Mr Gama was found guilty maybe we could have done something.   But the problem is that there is third one which has got nothing to do with condonation and procurement and in our view it is sufficiently serious to justify dismissal therefore we cannot take him back on the basis of this third one.  What do you say?  Is that not logical?    But…    Yes but Mr Mkwanazi maybe remotely you could apply that reasoning if you took the view that the board and the executives who were attacked by Mr Gama had something wrong.   But at the time when you were dealing with this matter you knew that even Mr Gama had admitted that he had been properly found guilty of these acts of misconduct relating to procurement.  Therefore his attacks on the board for – and on the executives for pursuing him for misconduct was unjustified.   That is the reasoning that I would have expected from you and the board.  To say when – once you realised that this other charge had nothing to do with procurement you say but he is admitting that he is guilty.  So he was attacking these executives and the board for pursuing charges of misconduct against him saying that this was part of an agenda.  He has now admitted that there was no such.  He has now admitted that he was guilty.   They had proper grounds to pursue him.  So actually the fact that by now he was admitting that the – he was guilty makes his attacks on them even more serious.  Because he is now admitting in effect that these people were doing their jobs.  So therefore he should never have attacked them.  Do you not agree with that reasoning?    Yes.  Okay alright. Mr Myburgh.    Please wait for me Mr Myburgh.    Page 4 of Bundle.    2.  I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  Just to maybe complete what we were discussing Mr Mkwanazi.  On this reasoning that I was articulating to you it would therefore seem to me that it would not have been right and it was not right – it would not have been right to say we will reinstate Mr Mkwanazi – Mr Gama nevertheless because even though there is this charge of which he has been found guilty which has got nothing to do with procurement when you look at the situation in the way I am articulating.   It would seem to me that that should lead you to say no but we cannot really take him back because the fact that he admits guilt does not mitigate the situation.  It makes it worse because he attacked people for doing their job and did so publicly.  You understand?    Yes okay alright.    It seems the – it seems…    I do not understand that Mr Mkwanazi.  Please help me understand that.  I do not understand that.  You come to an organisation for purposes of being part of the board.  You are new in this organisation.  I know that previously you had been I think Group CEO and so on.    But for purposes of being part of the board you are new.  You come at a time when there is a matter that the Minister tells you about on the first occasion he meets with you and offers you to the position of chairperson of the board.  So it is obvious an important matter and he wants you – instructs you to review it.  That means you must go into it and see whether you know there was fairness or not okay?    Now the organisation has been using this particular law firm.  This law firm has been handling this matter over the previous two years or so from the disciplinary hearing they had represented Transnet even in the high court application which they won. They succeeded.  It means even in the disciplinary hearing they represented Transnet successfully.   They won because Mr Gama was found guilty of three serious acts of misconduct and was dismissed.  So these are attorneys or this is a legal team which you must have got to know had won the high court application for Transnet that Mr Gama had brought against Transnet.   2. Had won the disciplinary hearing.  So they served your organisation well.  Now you want to understand whether there was some unfairness.  You do not want to talk to them?  You just wanted to get another law firm on what grounds?  When you have not – they have not said anything you do not like.   They – they have not performed anything badly.  On the contrary they have done very well for Transnet. But you do not want even to talk to them.  You want to go to another law firm.  I do not understand that.    Why do you change a winning team?  This is a winning team.    But..    Well if you had had a discussion with this law firm which had been so successful with his legal team – if you had had a discussion with them and through the discussion you felt that they advises may be on some of the issues on which you sought advice were not satisfactory I would understand wanting to say let me hear somebody else.  But I have difficulty understanding the logic where you do not - had not even discussed with them and yet they have been successful.  You understand where I am coming from?     Yes.  It does seem to me conduct that is difficult to explain.  As I say, if you have had a meeting with     ...Mr Gama owed costs.  They were pursuing that.  It looks like they were doing right.  So if you had met with them that briefed you and you had raised certain questions and through that discussion when you felt that, you know, you wanted another perspective because you are now taken with their perspective.   That I could maybe understand but you did not talk to     You are not even saying other than that you wanted a different ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Mr Myburgh.     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh. ADV MYBURGH SC Yes.     Could it be that you wanted a law firm or an attorney who could you that there was some unfairness in this dismissal?  Because Mr Todd had prepared an opinion or a report which he sent to, I think Ms Senamela or Mr Senamela to pass onto you to where he made it clear that, in effect, Transnet had a very strong case in the arbitration.     Is it... could it be that you were looking for somebody who would tell you that there was unfairness in this dismissal.     Mr Myburgh.     [laughing]  It could not have been music in your ears Mr Mkwanazi.  Could it have been?     Well, you know Mr Mkwanazi.  By this time, you would have known... well, you knew that the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry who had come to the conclusion that Mr Gama was guilty of these three serious acts of misconduct and who had concluded that each one of these three serious acts of misconduct would have justified dismissal on its own, was a senior counsel.   You would have known that.  Actually, this letter says so     It is like Mr Mkwanazi, you and the board were bending over backwards to try and accommodate Mr Gama.  It is not like you were looking at the matter objectively.  It is like you were bending over backwards to accommodate Mr Gama.  Or maybe to accommodate the shareholder minister’s inclination because he had already said that, you know, the dismissal was unfair.  That is how it comes across.  You want to comment on that?     You agree?  Okay alright.       Let us... is there an indication how long it might take?     Fifteen?     Ten.  Okay we have to adjourn because apparently there is some technical problem.  Mr Mkwanazi, we will adjourn and the technicians will tell us once the problem has been addressed.  We adjourn.     Okay.     Ja... I am sorry.  I am sorry, Mr Mkwanazi.  I am sorry.  I think you ...[intervenes]      I think you are on the same page up to a certain point.  Mr Mkwanazi, you must tell me if I misunderstand.  I seem to understand you to see, you concede that the board could not have had this Interim Report which starts at page 401.  It could not have deliberated on that in making the decision whether to reinstate Mr Gama.     You concede that?     For the first time, yes.     Okay, no, no.  Let us take it step-by-step.      Okay you concede that this is not the report that you ...[intervenes]      ...the board could have deliberated upon in making the decision to reinstate Mr Gama.     That is the Interim Report.     You accept that your affidavit at page... paragraph 6.1 talks about an Interim Report of KPMG which might suggest it is this report.     But ...[intervenes]      You accept that one.  What the affidavit says, cannot be correct?     Okay alright.  Then Mr Myburgh, you want to take it from there?     Did the board as at the 16t h of February, have any report before it at all which talked about how any employees had been dealt with in terms of deviations or non-compliance procurement procedures?     Yes.  Now, I understand your evidence insofar as it says you were aware of such reports, one or two.  Or you were in possession of such reports.  But are you sure that those reports or one of them, those reports were or one of those reports was before the board at the meeting of the 16t h of February?     Ja.     Do you recall whether, if there was such a report before the board, it did deal with the facts of those other cases in order to be able to compare like with like in regard to Mr Gama?  Because it cannot be useful to just look at any case where there was non-compliance.     Each case has to depend on its own merits, is it not?     Yes. MR     Yes.  Okay Mr Myburgh.     916.  Not 8916, I think.  916.     Yes.  One second, Mr Myburgh.  Mr Mkwanazi?     Mr Myburgh just read from paragraph 4.1.10 at page 981.     But I think arising from that, he has a question for you.     Mr Myburgh.     Did you note that last paragraph Mr Mkwanazi on page 90, namely paragraph ...[intervenes]      Page 90, same page?     Paragraph 67.4.     Where Mr Todd says    You did?     Having read that, would you accept that, at least what these attorney was telling Transnet and the board was, the outcome of the disciplinary inquiry is one that is fully justified and to do anything to undo that, you would need very compelling reasons.  Is that how you understood it?     Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.     Ja, those are minutes of the meeting of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee on 3 February 2011.     Oh.  Can you hear me now?     Can you hear me now?     Oh.     Well, you see, Mr Mkwanazi, I mean you did indicate that you were listening to Mr Todd’s evidence yesterday so you know all the things that I was saying and at some stage I did say that part of the reason why I was articulating some of the thoughts that were crossing my mind was precisely so that somebody like you who could be listening, who would still be coming to give evidence, could know what sort of issues were troubling me so that when you come to testify, you know, you might have thought about them and can address them.   So it is a transparent way of looking at issues, so you know what is going on in my mind, you can address it head on if you can and if you cannot, you cannot, but I am not hiding from you what is going on in my mind. So I have difficulty with the – I have serious difficulty with the whole idea of the board reinstating somebody who had occupied such a senior position in the organisation and who had been found guilty of such serious acts of misconduct and was not challenging those findings, you know, accepted that they were correctly made but with the board thinking of reinstating that person.  But now, you are already here, as this committee, are doing something that contemplates that this person could actually be promoted.  I cannot understand the logic unless there is something else.   But in terms of the facts of the case, in terms of the process, fair process to which Mr Gama had been subjected and looking at the seriousness of his contract, I am looking at this committee and I am saying not only is this committee thinking of reinstating Mr Gama, actually it is thinking of – it seeks to give him a platform to go and occupy an even higher position despite the failures in his conduct.  How is that possible?   How is it possible that so many people – or the people in this committee and subsequently in the board would think that this is correct?  That is my thinking, you know, as I say even yesterday and on other days, I say in the hearing what is going on in my mind because I am being transparent.   If somebody want to address it and they can address it and say Chairperson, I see this is how you are thinking but here is another angle from which you must look at it, then I can look at it but when it comes to this issue I have this serious difficulty, what can you say to me about it?      Upon reflection, because you have had many years since this thing happened, upon reflection, as you look at it now, look back, did you think it was the right thing for this committee to do?     Yes, okay, alright.  Thank you.     Did you mean you did not know why you were settling?     Yes?     H’m.  So you must have said so.     And in the context it could only mean you did not know why you were settling.  Is that right?  In the context …[intervenes]     Because the question which had just been asked …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, but I am saying in the context of this discussion, if the recording is correct that you said we do not know, could it …[intervenes]     Yes, okay, alright.     Well, I do not know, Mr Myburgh, whether you want to take him step by step.  I think all of the points you are making are important but you have got all of them together.     H’m.     Which means Mr Mkwanazi you were saying the strength of your case and the strength of Mr Gama’s case was more or less the same and yet Mr Mapoma, a senior legal person within Transnet, had just finished saying we have a very, very strong case and he is a lawyer.     Yes.  And then Ms Tshepe says    Yes.     Well, maybe before that, Mr Myburgh, just in the paragraph, Mr Mkwanazi, that Mr Myburgh read to you where Mr Mapoma is saying that Transnet has got a very, very good case against Mr Gama, what do you say about this statement by him where he says – after saying     Because when you have a good case you do not want to postpone, you want to finalise the case.     You are ready.     I am leaving it to you, Mr Myburgh.     To say the next point.     Ja.     And therefore, winning the case at the arbitration would defeat the whole object of Mr Gama being reinstated as you had been instructed according to Mr Mapoma, therefore it had to be postponed to try and settle because otherwise we are going to win this case and Mr Gama will not come back.  What do you say?     You understand.     Yes, okay.     You see, when you try and find a rational explanation for something, for some decision and you cannot find it, you are bound to look elsewhere and say okay, there is not logical explanation for this decision, so why would these people have done this.  I mean there are a number of things that since this morning we have asked you and you have responded, we have discussed which it seems to me step by step make the Board’s decision to reinstate Mr Gama seem very irrational.  We will see by the end of your evidence whether that’s where e will be or whether we will be at a point where it seems rational, it can be understood and so on, but we go back to this position, I mean when we read this statement by Mr Mapoma here at page 855 where he tells the committee how strong Transnet’s case is, how good the chances are that Transnet is going to win this arbitration, and then he says that is why we said let us rather postpone the matter to the 24 t h of April, so that we can pursue a settlement process.   Obviously that means as far as he knows, to say the least, he thinks we think this case is not a good idea, because otherwise when you think you are going to win and you want to win, you are going to say I want the arbitration tomorrow, I am ready you know, but now the way he talks it is like that would be bad news if we win, so that is why we have postponed, we want to try and settle the matter. And then you go back to me sitting here who have heard evidence of Ms Hogan, I have heard part of the evidence of Mr Zuma, Ms Hogan said to me the Board, which is the Board before your Board, interviewed various candidates for the position of Group Chief Executive Officer for Transnet, it was a rigorous process, they recommended, they came up with a candidate, they recommended the candidate, the candidate was Mr Sipho Masego, and Ms Hogan put the candidate before Mr Zuma and said I support this candidate, the Board says this is the candidate, and she says Mr Zuma said my only choice for the position of Group Executive Officer for Transnet is Mr Gama and she said but Mr Gama has not been recommended by the Board, the Board thinks he still needs some more experience and in any event Mr Gama is facing some investigation, or some allegations, there could be a disciplinary process, there are serious allegations against him, and then Ms Hogan says Mr Zuma said well in that process, in that case the position will have to remain unfilled until those processes have run their course and Ms Hogan wrote a memo or a letter to Mr Zuma which set out exactly what the process had been, but the position remained unfilled until of course your Board came in, but Ms Hogan gets dropped from cabinet at the end of October. This is at a time when Mr – those processes that Mr Zuma had spoken to Ms Hogan about, if Ms Hogan’s evidence is true, had run its course, Mr Gama had been found guilty and had been dismissed, but he had referred this dismissal dispute to the Bargaining Council.   Ms Hogan gets dismissed, another Minister gets appointed, Mr Gigaba, and on your evidence it looks like even before he officially starts as Minister of Public Enterprises on the 1 s t of November, he meets with you, but even if you are mistaken that it was in October, maybe it was early November, it looks like one of the first things he does, the new Minister, on your version, is to call you and raise among other matters the Gama matter with you and says Mr Gama’s dismissal was unfair and on your evidence he instructs you to review the Gama matter. Obviously the review could lead to Mr Gama being reinstated, of course it could lead to something else, other than reinstatement, but reinstatement is one of the things that it could lead to.   You agree?       So Mr Gigaba on your evidence initiates a process in terms of which your Board must relook at this case of Mr Gama.   You relook at that case, you look, you ask for legal opinions, most, if not all, say this dismissal was fair but of course the Deneys Reitz one has got a paragraph which says anything can happen when it comes to sanction, and then I said to you earlier on the way you and your Board were handling the matter it appears like you were bending over backwards to accommodate Mr Gama, you understood when I said that, and then you are now in this committee, the Governance and Nominations Committee, what are you talking about?   You are talking about whether this man, who was found guilty of such serious acts of misconduct, by an independent Chairperson, who could not have been part of any factions within Transnet, Senior Counsel, who ran what appears to have been a very thorough process, and Mr Gama being represented by a strong legal team, including senior counsel in that process, and he was found guilty out of that process.   You are now saying in effect look even if we have not taken him back yet, let him run for the higher position.   You have not even taken him back to his old position, but you are talking about saying let him run for a higher position, it does not make sense to me, unless there was really an agenda to bring Mr Gama back, that is what – those are the thoughts that are in my mind, and I mention them to you so that if you have anything to say to me that could influence me differently you can say so, but that’s what seems to come to my mind to say the way this committee is acting, the way this Board is acting, it is like it is hell-bent to get Mr Gama back, not only to his previous position, but they want him at the top, they want him to run for this position. Now how do you seek to be party to the possibility of promoting to the highest executive position in the company somebody that has been found guilty of such serious acts of misconduct, how do you do that as a Board. That is what I cannot understand, if you are able to make me understand it tell me.      You agree with the analysis, or you understand it?        And you agree with it, okay.  Mr Myburgh.     Mr Myburgh and Mr Mkwanazi the witness and Mr Mkwanazi the lawyer we are at about quarter past five, let us talk about how far we can go, I can still go on up to six if everybody is happy that we do that, I am happy to do that, and then maybe at six we can – if we haven’t finished we can talk about the way forward at that stage. Are you happy to go up to that point?     From your side, Mr Mkwanazi lawyer what is your situation?   You are fine with that okay alright, thank you.   Let us continue then, what page of what bundle?       I am sorry Mr Myburgh, please don’t forget your point that you want to ask, I just want to mention one thing arising from what I said to Mr Mkwanazi.    You see Mr Mkwanazi going back to what I said last time I said Mr Zuma has denied Ms  Hogan’s version that he said his only choice for the position of Group CEO is Mr Gama.  I don’t know what finding I will make in the end, but if Ms Hogan’s version is true then it seems that there may be room for somebody to say Mr Zuma would have been quite disappointed in the fact that Mr Gama was dismissed, and had been dismissed because that ruled him out of the running for the position of Group CEO, and it may well be that the new Minister had a discussion with him and he might have mentioned that there was this issue of Mr Gama, and he needs to look into it.  He might not have said he should be reinstated, but he might have said he should look into it and maybe that is why he instructed you to review it. You understand that?   But I am not ...[intervenes]      I am not saying that is so, but I am looking simply at the various versions and looking at what was happening and trying to make sense of what seems to have been happening. Thank you, Mr Myburgh?     Let us take a short break while they are attending to the sound.      We adjourn.     Yes continue Mr Myburgh, I am told the sound is fine now.     Paragraph …[intervene]     Hmm, oh Mr Myburgh?     Okay alright, you get this opinion being expressed in this paragraph.  It is – is does not say - well when you look at it sometimes it is difficult to say what it does say and what it does not say but on the one hand it     It is just an unsubstantiated statement there was a probability but it does not say what is the basis for the view that there was a probability, it does not tell you that.         And then of course it says    So then one is bound to say why would somebody of your experience, because you were quite experienced you had even been corporate executive of this entity yourself many years previously, you are experienced in corporate matters you are experienced in dealing with issues, I am sure you would have dealt with lots of dismissal matters at one stage or another as executive or group executive.   Why would you prefer this opinion as the opinion on which you would base your decision to reinstate Mr Gama as opposed to, one, the opinion given by Mr Todd, you would have heard when he gave evidence here, he is a specialist labour lawyer.  Of course I think Deneys Reitz also are specialists, but he gave an opinion that you read and you see as reflecting quite an application of mind on various issues.  Do you agree?          Yes, and you were also aware of the opinion from Webber Wentzel which said the process was fair.       You were aware that the Chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry who came to the conclusion that Mr Gama’s sanction, the sanction of dismissal was a fair one, was a senior counsel, a labour lawyer himself.   You were aware of all of that, so the question that Mr Myburgh was asking is how does one explain your reliance on this questionable opinion which is not motivated in any way when you have this other certainly looking at Mr Todd’s one because it is here well I have read it is you know it shows somebody who has applied his mind to all the issues and of course he had the benefit that he had been handling this matter for about two years or so.  So why would you prefer this one?           But again it is like you know that there is this opinion which is correct which say this dismissal was fair but it is like you keep on wanting another one that will allow you to reinstate Mr Gama that will say something else.  You know you see this one it says that there is this probability, you see it provides no reasons for this probability, provides no basis but nothing says to your mind look let us go back to that opinion which we cannot fault, Mr Todd’s one, we cannot fault because as I understand it you have not been able to say we had a problem with that opinion, isn’t it?        You could not fault it.      Yes, so one asks the question why did you not and the Board act on the basis of this opinion from Mr Todd that you could not fault?     But the difficulty is that you yourself have indicated that this opinion was weak.       It was weak you have accepted that.      It was not motivated it did not provide a basis you know for or it did not show you this is the basis on which it is grounded you know and I would have thought that if you and the Board in seeking to get somebody else’s opinion other than the opinions that you already got which we saying the dismissal was fair.   I would have thought that if you remained open minded as to whether you would reinstate or you would settle or you would not settle I would have thought that when you got this opinion you realised that it was weak compared to this other opinion from Bowman Gilfillan and you saw that it was not even motivated I would have thought that you would say look if we act on the basis of this opinion we are opening ourselves to serious attack.  The opinion that we should act on is this one that we cannot fault that is what I would have expected you go along with that that would be a reasonable thing to do.            Yes, but the Board did not do this.      Yes, okay Mr Myburgh.      Yes, but of course surely sitting here now looking at this you would accept would you not you ought have to acted in terms of the opinion given by Mr Todd.      No but I am not sure that I understand that you see when you put it like that it gives the impression that you wanted a different set of eyes so to speak and you were going to take what they say, what those lawyers say take their view without evaluating it yourself and seeing whether it was sound.  Whereas if the approach was we want to hear what they have to say but we are not going – we will only act we will evaluate both options if they are not they are not the same.  We will evaluate both and we will act on what we believe is sound that is what I would have expected.  I should not have expected that of the Board?     And well I guess – and decided to go along with it even though you realised it was weak and it was not resonating.       Yes, okay Mr Myburgh.       Do you accept Mr Mkwanazi at least now you know we have been dealing with this from this morning but you were listening to Mr Todd’s evidence yesterday I mean the questioning you followed it and maybe you listened to Mr Mapoma’s evidence as well.  At least as you sit there now do you accept that the Board’s decision and your decision to reinstate Mr Gama in these circumstances does not make sense.         Oh, you must be talking about Deneys Reitz report dated 22 February 2011.         Go to page 19 of the same bundle.      You see that I a report, it says report for Transnet on settlement.        It is on a Deneys Reitz letterhead and it is dated 22 February and it goes up to page 22.  Is that the document that you say augmented these two…[intervene]         After the Board meeting?      Okay so before the Board meeting the augmentation was not there.      But you see now it seems to me that you and your Board were so hell bent on reinstating Mr Gama that when you had the other document that had this opinion     Ja, okay.       What page, Mr Myburgh?     One nine?     Effectively saying Mr Gama has no case.    How do you settle?  How do you reinstate him?  How do you give him full back pay?  Of course how do you even undertake to pay his legal costs?  It is – it is just something that is so difficult to understand Mr Mkwanazi.  Except if one says there was some other agenda that the board was pursuing in wanting to get Mr Gama back.  It was not the question of was there some unfairness in his dismissal?  It was not just a question of are we likely to lose the case in the arbitration?  It was other considerations.  Can you understand why – what I am saying? MR    Can you fault it?    Yes.      Mr Myburgh.    Yes how much more time do we still need?    Quite some time.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. ADV MYBURGH    Ja.    Yes.    Well let me – let me first check with – from yourself.  From your side are you still able to maybe add another hour or another thirty minutes or you have been standing the whole day.    Okay.  No, no that is fine.  So you would suggest that if possibly he comes back on Monday?    Okay alright maybe we could start early?    Yes.  Yes.   Mr Mkwanazi the attorney and Mr Mkwanazi the witness it seems that we should adjourn now.  I know that – I think we are all seated except Mr Myburgh he is the only one who has been standing the whole day.  We need to think about that.  But he – he suggests that we could continue on Monday morning.  Would that be fine with you?  Let us start with the lawyer.    Okay.      Mr Mkwanazi the witness you are fine – you would be fine with that?    Yes okay alright.  Okay.    Ja I do not know why there is always difficult in hearing you.  The line or reception is bad but you still require – you still – you are still asking for a five minutes break or you say    It is fine.    Oh you are confirming okay.    Okay alright.    Okay shall we start at 9   Okay alright.  We are going to adjourn then and then we will continue on Monday at nine o’clock.  We adjourn. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson.    Chairperson as you know Mr Mkwanazi is going to give evidence by way of Zoom by agreement with the parties and with your direction.    Perhaps he could be sworn in as a witness and then I will take him to his affidavit and that can then be admitted.    I have been asked to enquire whether you happy with the arrangements?    We have tried that there was really organised chaos before you arrived.    Chairperson I think this is probably the best that we can do.    And so if I might just mention I think there is absence of lighting.  The lighting has been moved to my left so that it does not shine directly in my face so that I can look at the screen.    So it might appear slightly darker to you.    Yes thank you.    Yes thank you Chairperson.  Good morning Mr Mkwanazi.    You would have been provided with a bundle of documents I refer to as Bundle 4A.    Could I please ask you to turn to page 1 in that bundle?    Yes that is correct.    If you go to…    Correct.    So Mr Mkwanazi during the course of your testimony when I refer to page numbers I am referring to the black page numbers here on this page – page 3 on the left hand side, do you see that?    I would like just to start off by asking you to confirm.  Is this your declaration?    If you could then please turn to the end of your declaration at page 20.      And do you confirm that you signed this declaration on the 31 August this year?    And then I would ask you to confirm attached to your affidavit where a series of annexures we have A, B and C – C was the KPMG report.      If you then turn all the way to page – right at the end of the flag to page 21.412. Are you there?    We received the annexures up to A, B and C we did not receive D and E.    Alright so you confirm that Annexures A, B and C were annexures to your affidavit?    Alright.  Thank you.  Now Mr Mkwanazi if you could go back then please to page 3.    What I am going to do is I am going to lead you through your declaration.    And I am going to give you the opportunity of presenting the evidence that is set out here and after that I will have a series of questions for you and obviously the Chairperson would ask questions whenever he wishes to.  You follow the process.    Okay let us start off then with your personal details at paragraph 1.      Were you an Executive Director of Transnet from 1996 to 2001?    You were also a former Group Chief Executive Officer of Transnet and you held that position from 2001 to 2003?    And then I suppose importantly for    You say that you were furthermore the Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee as well as a member of the Acquisitions and Disposal Committee during your tenure on the board.    You then go on to say at paragraph 4.1 that you were asked to provide this declaration essentially dealing with the decision to enter into a settlement with Mr Gama and reinstate him.  Is that correct?    And you were also asked to deal with the Terms of that settlement agreement?    Perhaps I could ask you then to pick up at paragraph 4.2 and verbalise what is contained there about your meeting with Minister Gigaba?    May I just ask you to confirm when did you hold this meeting with Minister Gigaba?    October?    2010?    Alright please carry on.    Yes please.  So then in the next part of your declaration under heading 6 you deal with as you put it The history of deviations at Transnet.  And that runs through pages 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and then at 13 you deal with condonations at Transnet Freight Rail.  At 14 Deviations in respect of mega projects and then one goes all the way to 17 before you then deal with Mr Gama.    What is it that you want to say about the history of deviations at Transnet?    Alright could I perhaps just take you back to the beginning.    At paragraph 6.1 you say – this is at page 6.     “On 22 December and in February 2011 – sorry 22 December 2010 and in February 11 the Public Protector made certain allegations about Transnet Procurement Procedures and the Gama matter.”     “The new board appointed this JV of KPMG and Nkonki to investigate a number of issues around the procurement at Transnet on the basis of the Public Protector allegations and Gama’s appeal on the sanction of dismissal.”     “The first report was done quickly on the information – as the information was historical.  It is that first report that was used by the board in its deliberations.  A law firm Norton Rose was consulted by Transnet and a different law firm Webber Wentzel was used by KPMG and Nkonki.  The final report was completed in November 11 as there was a lot of resistance from executives in cooperating with the KMPG and Nkonki team.” Would you confirm that?    So Mr Mkwanazi what you then do at 6.2 is you start listing the findings of the KPMG Nkonki report.    As you say which was finalised in November 2011.    Alright.  And then over the page at 6.4 you deal with an internal audit report dated May 2011.  Is that right?    And then I just wanted to make sure that I understand.  I mean it seems to me that by and large then the contents of this seven or eight pages is really taken from the KPMG report.  Is that – is that fair enough?     Alright.  Then Mr Mkwanazi, just so     It is the VAE contract if I understand you correctly.     The HMG contract.     And what was the third one?     AWP contract.     I just ask you to confirm.  As I understand your evidence.  You say that condonation was granted in respect of all of those irregularities but disciplinary action was net instituted against the managers involved.     Yes.       Alright.       Just to ...[intervenes]      Sorry.       Just to summarise then.  In relation to each of these three big contracts ...[intervenes]      ...VAE, HMG and AWP.  Condonation was granted on condition, as you have put it, that disciplinary action be taken against the relevant member.     Alright.     But could I take you please to page 10 of your affidavit?       And let me direct your attention to paragraph 6.5 where you deal with the VAE contract.     And then at paragraph 6.5.1, the     So would ...[intervenes]      Yes.     But would you confirm then that condonation was applied for?     Alright.  And then if you go to page 14 of your affidavit, paragraph 8.2 deals with HMG.  That is the other big contract that you spoke of.  Is that correct?     Where do you deal with AWP?     Do you deal with it in your declaration?     Alright.  I want to then, to take you to paragraph 9 and to focus then in... on the disciplinary action taken against Mr Gama.  Is there anything else that you want to say in relation to deviations and condonation historical?     Alright.  Thank you.  So perhaps I could ask you to deal with this.  Could you start with paragraph 9.1 and take the Chairperson through your evidence in this regard.     Well, it would be better if you verbalise it but of course you are allowed to have regard to the text of the declaration.       Alright.  Well, let me take you to the text.     You say at paragraph 9.2    That is what it states.  And then in two, perhaps, important passages that I may ask you a     Yes.     Yes, certainly.     Yes.     Just incidentally.  Did Mr Gama apply for condonation?     I see.     And then at paragraph 9...[intervenes]      Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, you say that KPMG should have looked into this but of course, you agreed to reinstate Mr Gama long before KPMG completed its investigation.     But Mr Mkwanazi, you dealt with Mr Gama on the basis that he had not offered or applied for condonation.  That is the basis upon which you dealt with him.       Yes.     Yes.  So let us go again ...[intervenes]      Let us go to the last sentence of paragraph 9.4.  You say, in effect, if he had applied, the outcome could have been different.  Is that right?     Let us go to paragraph 9.5.   “The incoming Transnet Board of 2010 which was dealing with this mega projects that were frankly not managed well.” Had you somehow tried and deal with the Gama matter on the assumption that he would have been granted condonation?   I do not understand because... if you just bear with me.      Yes, Chair.     Yes, thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, before the Chairperson asked you that series of questions, do I understand your evidence to have been in effect that you said well, look, let us assume that he applied for condonation.     The worst that would have happened to him is that he would have got a final warning because that  was the precedent.  Sorry …[intervenes]     But then why did you reinstate him?     But, Mr Mkwanazi, you have just said that the result could have been worse, it might have involved a dismissal.     Yes, well, I mean the real problem you have is you do not know what would have happened but for some extraordinary reason you dealt with Mr Gama in the most generous fashion and you just divine that he would have somehow have been reinstated.     Well, that he somehow would have not been dismissed.     But, Mr Mkwanazi, there were people who conducted themselves – certainly that is the finding of KPMG – in the same way as Gama and were dismissed.  That was one of their findings.     Correct?     Yes and in fact have you heard of Mr Salemela and Mr Khanya?     Do you know that they were the two people who signed the GNS confinement and then presented it to Mr Gama and then he signed it?     Yes.  And do you know what happened to them?     Yes, they were dismissed.  Those are two person involved in the same misconduct as Mr Gama.     I beg your pardon?     Yes and have you ever taken the time to read the finding of Nazeer Cassim SC in that case?     You did not have any difficulty with them being dismissed, did you?     It was in 2010.     Mr Mkwanazi, let me just understand before I move on.  You, as the Acting Group Chief Executive and the Chairperson, when you took a decision to reinstate Mr Gama where he had been dismissed on one of the charges in relation to GNS, you did not even know that two other managers junior than him had been dismissed.  You did not even know that?     And if you had known that presumably your decision would have been different, of course.     It might be.     Alright.     Well, it seems to me, Mr Mkwanazi, what you did is you focused on alleged inconsistencies instead of consistencies.  I mean here were two people whose dismissals were consistent with Mr Gama’s.  Why did you look at it the other way?  I mean, you had the benefit …[intervenes]     Well, we will come to the 22 in time but perhaps I could just ask you, so why did you not just discipline the 22?     Yes, so?     Perhaps you miss my point.  Why did you not just retain the dismissal of Mr Gama and then discipline and dismiss the other 22?  Why not?  Why did you do it the other way around?     No, I have not, thank you.     Certainly, thank you, Mr Chair.     Thank you Mr Chairperson, Mr Mkwanazi before I finish off with your statement I just want to confirm as I understand it that you make these two concessions in response to the Chairperson’s questions.   Firstly, you accept that you went wrong in giving Mr Gama the benefit of not having applied for condonation, correct?     We are going to come to that advice that you received.        The second concession that you made in response to the Chairperson questions is you accept that in any event condonation and disciplinary action are two different things.  Correct?       And in fact as I understand you, you accept that whether or not someone is granted condonation does not necessarily have a bearing on the fairness of the sanction of dismissal.  Correct?     Thank you.  Let us then move to your affidavit.  So we have dealt with paragraphs 9.4 and     Then you go onto say at 9.7    “The terms of which we are negotiated through Transnet’s internal bargaining process.”   Is that what you say?      But you were actually the negotiator.      I see; you were the lead negotiator?     And then you say    Now you remember if we go back to the beginning you confirmed that you had been asked to explain the decision to settle with Mr Gama and the terms of the settlement agreement.  Do you remember being asked to do that?     By the Commission that is why you put up this declaration.      Why do you not deal in this declaration with what was paid to Mr Gama by way of salary, short term incentives, long term incentives, cost of his Bargaining Council referral, costs of his disciplinary hearing, costs of the High Court proceedings.  Why do you not deal with any of that when you were asked to?        Yes.      Yes I will.     The letter is attached to your affidavit; you find that at page 21.1.       And you will see at page 21.3 there is a heading reinstatement 21.4 retrospectivity of reinstatement these are all contentious issues.        Final written warning, costs those are all the terms of the settlement agreement.  Then at     So that is just not reinstatement that is why did you give him a final warning that had expired?  Why did you pay him full back pay, LTI’s and SDI’s and why did you pay his costs?  Do you accept you do not address any of that in your declaration?      So let us firstly deal with whether or not you dealt with it in this declaration can you please just give us an answer.       Have a look and tell us.     Do you need an opportunity to look Mr Mkwanazi because I would like a straight and a definitive answer please?     Mr Mkwanazi you also do not say anything about wanting to put up a supplementary affidavit in this affidavit, do you?       Why not if that was your intention?     Thank you and then at paragraph 10     And then you go and deal with that     And here you say    Early on in your evidence you spoke about 22 can we reduce that to 12?     Well here you say 12.      I see.      Then if we go over the page to     Alright, so are you saying that Deneys Reitz opinion was before the Board on the 16 t h?     Alright.      Alright, well then I think I understand it.  So you are right there were Deneys Reitz opinion or certainly input from Deneys Reitz in a document dated the 15 t h of February the day before the Board meeting and then on the 22 n d of February a few days later there was the more expanded version.  Correct?     So let me then – so is there anything else you want to say in relation to your declaration and your statement before I move into my questioning of you?       Yes.      So let me start off and I am going to run through the chronology of events.  Amongst the files that we have put up is a Bundle 2 where we have got a very long extract from the evidence of Barbara Hogan and perhaps I should start…[intervene]      …there, yes.      So could I take you please Mr Mkwanazi to page 216.  This is an extract from the evidence of Ms Hogan before this Commission.      216.      I thought perhaps the one way to speed this up is for me to take you to page 250 and to read to you a paragraph from her affidavit or statement that was read into the record at page 250 line 10.  Are you there?      Bundle 2, Chairperson.      From line 11    Yes, you have read about it.  So there was then a hiatus because Ms Hogan had to wait until the outcome of Mr Gama’s disciplinary enquiry and then let us go to that part at page 267 at line 22.        “Now you know I waited for the Outcome of the disciplinary hearing but once he was found guilty on three counts and he was dismissed on all three counts the Deputy Minister and myself initiated a process to appoint a new Transnet Board and that was, that was then a year after of this happening and it was then towards July, August 2010.”   Do you see that?      And the if I can ask you to please to go to page 277.  Ms Hogan then attempted to constitute a new Board or have a new Board appointed but she says at line number 3 at page 277.      Page 277, line 3.      She says    28 t h or 29 t h June, yes. “I was fired by the President at the end of October.”     Now Mr Mkwanazi this is also something I can take you to other passages in her evidence that received a lot of publicity Mr Gama’s suspension and disciplinary action it was something of a political hot potato, not so?       And you knew about that?     Did you know that Ms Hogan had been or lost her post as a Minister in these circumstances?     Now the new Minister, Mr Gigaba he was appointed as I understand it Chairperson you will correct me if I am wrong with the effect from the 1 s t of November.     So you then met did you with the new Minister and the Chairperson has asked you and you confirmed you did that in October before he had even been appointed.      Okay, and you set out in your declaration what it is that you discussed.     If we go please back to your declaration Bundle 4A.       Yes, I want to take you to page 4.      If I can ask you to drop down to     Mr Mkwanazi was it also in the media that former President Zuma was a devout supporter of Mr Gama?     And you were aware of that?     So let us go to paragraph 4.3.4    Yes, how do you think he came to know about that?  You smile.      Yes.     Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Mkwanazi so just before the Chairman asked you a question I just want you to confirm that you said in fact that the Minister might actually have heard about this from Mr Gama himself.  Correct?     And as I understand it you knew about all of that?      Perhaps if I could just ask you to turn to page 253 of Bundle 2, two five three.       Yes, at the top again it is quoting for     Now are you suggesting to the Chairperson that when you met with the new Minister or soon to be appointed Minister he never spoke to you about or mentioned Mr Gama?   Yes.    Why did you not put that in your – in your declaration?    Were you going to put that in your supplementary affidavit perhaps?    So was it apparent to use that Minister Gigaba had been holding discussions with Mr Gama or not?    And when the Minister Gigaba told you that he thought the sanction of dismissal for Mr Gama was too harsh what sanction did he have in mind?    Was it clear to you though that Minister Gigaba would have been in favour of the reinstatement of Mr Gama from this discussion and his statement that he considered the dismissal too harsh?    Was that clear to you?    Mr Mkwanazi that really does not answer my question.  Let me perhaps put it another way.    Was it clear to you further to this discussion with Minister Gigaba that he at very least would have been in favour of a settlement then with Mr Gama?    But Mr Mkwanazi again that is not what I asked you.  Could we just have a straight answer and then I will move on.      Was it clear to you further to this discussion that Mr Gigaba at least would have been in favour of a settlement with Mr Gama yes or no?    Yes thank you.  Just so that I have it clear in my mind he considered the sanction of dismissal too harsh, correct?    Well that was the note I took of your evidence.     I see.  Because I was going to…    Suggest to you.    Alright we will come to that.  Let me then…    You see…    Mr Mkwanazi really what I wanted to put to you is that my note reflects that you said that Minister Gigaba said dismissal was too harsh and I wanted to put to you that that is precisely the basis upon which the board in a few months’ time reinstated him.  The minute says dismissal was too harsh.  Is that just a coincidence?    Alright.  Let me carry on with the chronology.  So this is a meeting you had in October.     There is some reference in the …    I beg your pardon.    No I will not.    Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Mkwanazi let us then move forward from October.  There is a statement    I am asking you to confirm that the new board commenced its duties on the 13 December 2010, is that correct?    No I am asking you.  When did you commence your duties – the new board?    Yes.    It was actually December 10.    The middle of December?    Alright now if you go to Bundle 2 can I ask you please to turn to page 24.    Yes that is the Public Protectors complaint.    Page 24 Chairperson.    So this complaint you receive really within a week or two of commencing your duties as the new chairperson, correct?    Certainly.    Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi I was going to take you to the Public Protectors letter addressed to you at page 2 Bundle 2 on the 22 December 2010 a week or two?    A week or two after you took up your position as the new chairperson.  I just wanted to…    Confirm that in the second paragraph it    If you look at Roman numeral iv  “That there existed internally a procedure for condoning exceeding limits in respect of transactions etcetera.” The very point that Mr Gigaba had raised with you, correct?    Now I want to take you please to – sorry.    Yes thank you.  Now we know that you then appointed in the next year – early in the next year KPMG and Nkonki to investigate this complaint, correct?    Could I take you please to Bundle 1 page 811, 811.      And 11.      Now this is a letter from KPMG and Nkonki dated the 12 January 11 setting out their ...[intervenes]     I beg your pardon I am so sorry.    Thank you.  This is a letter dated the 12 January 2011 from KPMG and Nkonki where they set out their terms and conditions of engagement.  Do you see that?    Now that letter is addressed to Mr Mapoma General Manager Legal Services.  If I could direct    Yes I know that.    Might you have attended the initial briefing meeting    So what you presumably would agree is that you asked Mr Mapoma to assist you.    And that is presumably why he must have at least have attended this meeting and then the letter setting out terms of engagement is sent to him.  Correct?    Can we go to the end of that document at page 820.  You confirm then that you ultimately signed this document.    On the 24 January.    So Mr Mkwanazi Mr Mapoma agrees with you that you tasked him with assisting him with responding to the Public Protectors complaint and investigating it which related to Mr Gama.    What Mr Mapoma says is that right from the outset of his involvement in this project you told him that you had been instructed to reinstate Mr Gama.     So who told you to do that?     Was that Mr Gigaba at the October meeting?     So now we can add another paragraph to your affidavit?     Well, so far you have told the Chairperson – and these are critically important things.     So far you have told the Chairperson is that what we can add to your declaration is, that Mr Gigaba was of the view that Mr Gama’s dismissal was too harsh.   Now, further questioning, what you say can be added to your affidavit is also that he asked you to review the dismissal of Mr Gama, correct?     Tell us what instruction he gave you, please.     Mr Mkwanazi, please can you just focus on what I am asking you?       You said just now that you were asked to review the dismissal of Mr Gama.       Well, how would you put it?     Well, then you and I agree with one another.  So ...[intervenes]      ...Mr Gigaba asked you to do that?     And he was... his own view that it was unfair.     So he asked you then to look into fairness of Mr Gama's dismissal, correct?     Did you feel that you were at liberty to refuse that request?     Did you construe it as a shareholder instruction, yes or no?     Thank you.       Yes, but he could have had another meeting with you if you wanted.     Alright.  So now ...[intervenes]      And turn up page 30.       So I wanted just to take you to what Mr Mapoma had to say at paragraph 8.     He says    Well, perhaps I can add to that.       The Chairperson asked him, what actually what words did you use that caused him to infer that.  And he said that you said to him that it was an authority above the ministry.       But well that bears out his version because you did not name-drop.  He says you did not.  You did not use the name.     That is a fact.  You understand?     How would Mr Mapoma had got this so wrong?  I mean, he is a lawyer.  He is someone who you entrusted with responding to, it seems to me, the most important piece of work that landed on your desk literally immediately upon you becoming the chairperson.     You went out, you sought his advice and assistance.  You obviously thought of him highly.  How does he get this wrong?     Yes.     Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, we have seen that there was a meeting with KPMG ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Mr Mkwanazi, I just want to ask you, why again, why did you not deal with this in your declaration?  Because one of the questions you were asked to address was whether the settlement was influenced by any member of cabinet?  Do you not think it would have been necessary for you to explain?     Well, let us just deal with it ...[intervenes]      Well, in fact what you were asked Mr Mkwanazi is whether there was any member of cabinet who played any role directly or indirectly in the matter being settled?     I am sorry.     Why did you not put that in your declaration?     No, but Mr Mkwanazi in your declaration you answered that question in the negative.  You cannot get out of this by saying you are going to put up another affidavit.       Mr Chairperson, I see that it is one o’clock.  If this is a convenient time?     Thank you, Mr Chairman. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr Mkwanazi?     Good.  Just before lunch I was about to ask you, we have established that KPMG were approached on the 11 January 2011 …[intervenes]     No, no, no, it is not in any bundle, it is something we have been over.  You will remember that their engagement letter reflects that they were first approach on the 11 January 2011.     What I just wanted to ask you, is did you approach Deneys Reitz and Mr Sbu Gule at about the same time?      Towards the end of what?     So you say it was either at the same time or later in the month?     And how did you come to appoint Sbu Gule from Deneys Reitz?     Did you feel that you have answered my question?     How did come to appoint Mr Sbu Gule of Deneys Reitz, why did you go to him?     Mr Mkwanazi, really what I am getting at is this.  There are hundreds of attorneys in Johannesburg.     How did you come to appoint Mr Sbu Gule of Deneys Reitz?     So you must have been advised by Mr Mapoma?     Well, are you sure that you were not advised by Mr Mahlangu the special adviser to Minister Gigaba?     Well, let me then take you please to bundle 1.     Page 170.     The affidavit starts at 169.     You know Mr Mahlangu?     You knew him as the special adviser to Minister Gigaba.     He says at page 170, paragraph 7.     “Due to the passage of time I  cannot recall the exact reason for context of my discussion with MKWANAZI.  He conferred with me on a variety of matters in my capacity as special adviser to the Minister and in his capacity as Chairperson of Transnet on things that he needed me to convey to the Minister informally or prior to any formal process.  I recall that during my conversation with MKWANAZI, I advised that it was prudent for Transnet to seek legal advice on the company’s proposed course of action. We discussed a few options on eminent labour lawyers that he could consult.  One of the names that came up is that of Mr Sbu Gule who at the time was a partner or director at Deneys Reitz, now Norton Rose. I offered suggestions because of my familiarity with the legal profession.  It all remained with the Chairman on how he intended to proceed.” Do you recall that discussion?     So what we have here is the minister, as you put it, instructing you to undertake a review of Mr Gama’s case and you then landed up with the attorney suggested to you by the minister ’s special adviser, correct?     Now what I want to then take you to is the chain of communication between the special adviser and Mr Gigaba.  Can you please turn to page 178?     Of the same bundle, Mr Chairperson.     So this is an email from Mr Mahlangu to Minister Gigaba.     And the second bullet point says – and that email, Mr Mkwanazi, you would have seen is dated as early as the 18 January.     The second bullet point says    So you were nearing settlement, were you, as early as the 18 January.     The page is 178, Mr Chairperson.     Ja.     Of bundle 1, it is the second bullet point.  This special adviser, Mr Mkwanazi, reports to his boss, the minister, that he understands that Transnet is nearing a settlement with Gama on the 18 January.     The second bullet point.     Mr Mkwanazi?     This is a very troubling email.     Yes, I know, I want you to answer to what he says.     Where you [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Mr Mkwanazi, Mr Mahlangu says that he had conversations and discussions with you.  Where would have got this from, if he did not get it from you?     So he falsely reports to the minister?     Yes but it is a false report that he makes to the minister.     Well, if it is premature then it is false, correct?     Ja.  Mr Mahlangu will come and give evidence on Monday.     And then we will see what he has to say but certainly on the face of it what he reports to the minister is that you have already decided, have you not, to reinstate …[intervenes]     ...to settle Mr Gama, even before you had approached your board., correct?     I might have.     Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, perhaps I can just ask you again, I mean, is it possible that Mr Mahlangu could have just made this up?  I mean, how?  Very strange.     Yes, you are very good at camouflaging and talking about things that are not related to my question.  It would be very strange behaviour, would it not be, for a special adviser to make up something and report it to his minister.  It would, would it not?     Okay.     Alright, let us move on to something else.     I then wanted to move onto – so this is on the 18 January.     Let us move to the 21 January and could I ask you please to go file 3.     File 3, page 105.     105.     So you see towards the foot of the page it is an email from Mr Selinga to Mr Todd at Bowman Gilfillan.       Do you see that?     And in summary what Mr Todd is     So here on Friday the 21 January you put a halt to Transnet recovering its costs in terms of a High Court order.  Why?      But Mr Mkwanazi, this – the High Court litigation preceded the disciplinary hearing and the dismissal.  And there was a court order which was being executed in favour of Transnet.     Why on earth would you want to become involved in that and put a stop to that?  It was money that was owed to Transnet.     So you did this – if I understand your evidence correctly, in acquitting yourself of the shareholder instruction, that is what you have said, correct?     You have said that you put a stop to this …[intervenes]     And in so doing you acquitted yourself of the shareholder instruction.     But the shareholder instruction related to Mr Gama’s dismissal at a disciplinary hearing, this is High Court proceedings that were engaged in a year before where Mr Gama lost comprehensively and then sought leave to appeal and that was refused but somehow you found it to be your place to put this on hold.     Did you consult with your board or did you feel comfortable in taking this decision?     So – and you also then put a stop to the arbitration which was going to happen on the Monday the 24 t h.     But what I do not understand is a professional body was going to undertake an arbitration and rule on that very question within a few days, why did you allow that to happen?     But Mr Mkwanazi if it was unfair then the arbitrator would have ruled on it.     I see.  Alright well that was on the Friday and we can see that you were busy because on the Saturday you then engaged in a negotiation with Mr Gama didn’t you, you wasted little time.    Thank you.  So that is the Friday, let’s go to the Saturday.  Could I ask you please to turn to Bundle 2.     Certainly.     ...page 3 of Bundle 2.     This is a consultation note of your attorneys.     Of a meeting held at nine o’clock on Saturday the 22 n d of January.     Paragraph 2 says Temba Langa and Siyabonga Gama were also in attendance but we initiated a caucus meeting Sibo, Mr Mapoma, Mr Mkwanazi and myself, myself being Sibo Sangoli, do you recall attending this meeting?     The next paragraph says during the course of that discussion Mr Mapoma confirmed that the proposal that had been made from the company, which had been rejected still stands.  There is no counter proposal, so even by this time, the 22 n d of January, already a proposal had been made, is that right?     Yes, well maybe Mr Mhlangu wasn’t wrong with what he said to the Minister on the 18 t h of January.     Well when was the first proposal made?     Well it would have been before Saturday the 22 n d of January, correct?     I see. And what was the first proposal?     Sorry just so that I understand it, you were the lead negotiator in these negotiations?     Right so you can’t tell us what your opening gambit was?     So let us go to the next paragraph then Mr Mkwanazi.   “Mr Mkwanazi explained that he would like to assist Mr Gama where reasonably possible.” Do you see that?     Why would you want to do that?     But why would you want to assist the man where reasonably possible.  This is a – Mr Mkwanazi this is a Chief Executive of Transnet Freight Rail that had been fired and his arbitration was supposed to have been the forthcoming Monday.   You have a meeting with him on the Saturday and you tell him I want to assist you where – or you say to your lawyers that you want to assist Mr Gama where reasonably possible.  Why?     I see, well we are going to come to your description as you put it in inverted commas similar irregularities in a moment.  But let’s go on to see what you say.  So you say ja there was information out there and that was your point of departure but then you say what’s reported his intention, that being  yours, is to bring him back into his, the Chairman’s, office.  He wants Mr Gama to assist  him in a number of strategic issues.  Did you say that?     Alright and then you say    And then it says    That is an astonishing statement to make, give me an opinion that shows some unfairness and I will use that to persuade my fellow board members on 16 February to bring him back.   You said that.     I am going to come to what you keep saying similar cases, but you said now if there was similar cases to Mr Gama I would have had no problem at all, do you remember saying that, do you remember just saying that now?          Let me give you an example of ...[intervenes]       Mr Mkwanazi please let me finish.  Two cases that were similar were Van der Meller and Khanya.  You needn’t look around.     Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  Could you please Mr Mkwanazi go over the page to page 4, and there at paragraph 5 at the top it is recorded that he [being you] was to discuss the details of such return to Transnet with Mr Gama in a one-on-one meeting to be held between them.   Now we see that there is reference on more than one occasion to you holding one-on-one meetings, right, why did you not have other people present at meetings, negotiations with Mr Gama.      So you go on to say in that    Mr Mkwanazi you paint a picture that you had actually considered this matter, you were about to reinstate the man yet you didn’t even know when he had been fired or suspended.         Well it didn’t matter did it really because you were going to reinstate him no matter what.  You smile?      Now tell me ...[intervenes]       What is not included there you don’t ask the questions what was he dismissed for.  Did you know what Mr Gama was dismissed for?     Well explain to us please.     So you had other cases where a CEO had besmirched the Board of Transnet?     You say not really?      Have you had any?    Mr Mkwanazi what about the third charge which had nothing to do with tender irregularities, contractual irregularities and nothing to do with condonation.   It is very spurious isn’t it, the third charge if you actually know what happened.  I mean you have had the benefit of listening to Mr Todd.       Yes.      And you agreed ...[intervenes]      I need to deal with that if you don’t mind, if you just give me a second.     Thank you chair.  Mr Mkwanazi can I take you please back to Bundle 4A, your affidavit, page 18.  4A, 18, one eight.      If you will just bear with us for a second.    So it is paragraph 9.4, you have already confirmed this, but I just want to pick up what I said I needed to just look at carefully.  You say at 9.4 I personally fully agree with the disciplinary processes and findings of the then Transnet Board, presumably you’re talking about the findings of the disciplinary inquiry, correct?        So you fully agree, the only difficulty I have is that there was this common process in Transnet Systems called condonation, that was your only problem as you put it, correct?    Can I then ask you please to turn to Bundle 3.      Yes, page 88.      Page 88.      88.     Do you see the last third of the page there is a paragraph number 60.      Just above that there’s a quotation.  This is the finding of the Chairperson of the disciplinary hearing on the third charge the besmirchment charge, and I want to take you one, two, three, four lines down in the middle of the page, are you with me, there is a sentence saying “this charge”.     Yes, there is a quote, let me read the whole paragraph.      This charge - says the Chairperson – now you agree with this, goes to the heart of Trans ... ...[intervenes]       This charge, being the third charge.      “Goes to the heart of Transnet’s loss of faith in Mr Gama and there can be no doubt that dismissal is the only appropriate penalty for Gama’s conduct under this ...” It’s actually the 4 t h charge, you agree with that?    And it has got nothing to do – condonation has no bearing on this, correct?    Well then I do not understand on what possible basis you could have reinstated Mr Gama?  On your own version you are agreeing that the only appropriate penalty for the fourth charge is dismissal.  Your only problem is there is this thing called condonation that has no bearing on this charge Mr Mkwanazi.    Well I hope so.    Right.    But then why did you reinstate him?  Because your only problem was condonation.    Very well.  Mr Mkwanazi you have agreed – firstly let me debunk this.  There is not two main charges in this case.  There are three.  And you have agreed that the only appropriate penalty for the third charge – it was actually the fourth charge was dismissal.  You have accepted that.  And you have accepted that condonation has no bearing on that.  I think you driven to concede that the reinstatement of Mr Gama just on that basis was a monumental failure of judgment on your part. Is that not so?    Yes.    The reinstatement.    The reinstatement of Mr Gama was a monumental failure of judgment on your part.  Correct?    Well sorry that is being a bit generous.  You applied zero attention.  Because your – Mr Mkwanazi let us call a spade a spade.  Because you were acting on instructions.  You just did what the shareholder Minister told you to do.  That can be the only possible explanation because how else could you have just left out of account this critical fourth charge without having being grossly negligent in acquitting yourself of your duties.  How?    Would you – would you simply accept please that you erred in reinstating Mr Gama then?    He should not have been reinstated.    He should not have been reinstated, correct?    I am asking you.    Yes I can.    Thank you.  I was at page 4 of…    Of Bundle 2.  You then said at paragraph 6.    Once you are clear on those details …    Sorry.      Bundle 2.    So Mr Mkwanazi at page 4 paragraph 6 it is recorded that once he – that is you is clear on those details about when he was fired, when he was suspended and the like he being you can then formulate a proposal.    And then if you drop down to paragraph 14 of the consultation note at the foot of the page it would appear that Mr Gama and Mr Langa do not take issue with the fact that Mr Gama is guilty of the complaints as charged all they intend to challenge is the sanction that was imposed.  That you knew, correct?    And then at page 5 paragraph 16. “At that point the caucus ended so that Mr Mkwanazi could meet alone with Mr Gama.”    Yes.  So you could meet alone with him.    Now I would like to take you please to File of Bundle 3.    And to page 107.      I beg your pardon?    Well in the Gama arbitration as you call it an appeal.    You knew that.    Mr Mkwanazi.    You issued an instruction. MR    Bargaining Council.    Yes.    So you understood that Bowman Gilfillan were representing you in the Gama disciplinary – sorry Gama dismissal arbitration.  The one that was supposed to be held on Monday the 24t h you knew that.    Well that is astonishing.  Who were you asking for help from?    No I am saying when you [00   Well let us decide who is going to...    Yes.    Right.  Okay.  So that was not too difficult.      And you knew that that disciplinary hearing presumably you would have come to learn went on for a very long time.    Yes.    Yes.    And you knew as well that Bowman Gilfillan had engaged a very pre-eminent senior counsel.  Correct?    You knew that the attorney was Mr Todd?    You watched him on TV the whole of yesterday.    So you knew that?    So Mr Todd from Bowman Gilfillan and his senior counsel were steeped in this case, correct?  They had worked on it for a very long time, correct?    But you never so much as picked up the phone and asked Mr Todd for his advice on your prospects of success, correct?    I suppose why you did not do so is quite obvious.    Well why did you not phone him?    Can I suggest to you why you did not?    Well let me tell you why you did not because he would have told you that you were going to win the case.  Correct?    You did not want to hear that did you Mr Mkwanazi?  Correct?    Yes well precisely.    Right so let us…     Yes, the truth is.  Mr Mkwanazi, I put to you.  That you wanted someone to give you some friendly legal advice which you could use the board meeting on the 16t h of February to persuade your fellow board members to take back Mr Gama.   That is actually what happened, is it not?   You wanted friendly legal advice.  That is what the consultation note in effect says.  Correct?     Yes.  Well, precisely.  So because you wanted friendly legal advice, the last person you would go to is to Mr Todd who was going to tell you as it was that you had very good prospects of success of winning Mr Gama’s arbitration.  That you did not want to hear, correct?  That would not help you ...[intervenes]        I see.  So let us have a look then at Bundle 3, page 107.     Yes, thank you.  So let us go onto Bowman Gilfillan’s letter, dated the 24t h of January at page 7.     And just to fast-forward.  Let us go to 8 and to paragraph ...[intervenes]      Yes.  To paragraph 3.3.     Yes. “The legal team representing Transnet and the Bargaining Council Arbitration including senior counsel is satisfied that even on Mr Gama’s own version, it is likely that the sanction of dismissal will be upheld as fair with the three separate charges of misconduct of which he has now admitted to guilt. The chairperson of the inquiry who reached this conclusion, is a highly respect senior counsel and labour arbitrator who was initially proposed as arbitrator by Mr Gama and whose integrity has never been called into question.”     Right.  So here you know, the legal team representing Transnet at the Bargaining Council Arbitration including senior counsel is satisfied that you are going to win, correct?     That was not music to your ears.       Well, then let me then deal with something else that happened on the 24 t h of January.  Just to place in context.  Could I ask you please ...[intervenes]      ...to go to File 4, Bundle 4?     Page 6 of your affidavit or your declaration.     Chairman, I am told there is a technical problem and we need to break for a while.  Is that right?     Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, I want to take you to, please, to Bundle 4, page 6, part of your declaration.     You see that at paragraph 6.1, you make reference there to KPMG and Nkonki.       And then the next sentence says    Yes. “It is that first report that was used by the board in its deliberations.” Do you see that?     Now, could I ask you then to turn please to Bundle 2?     And if you turn up please page 380?  These are pages who would have been inserted earlier today.     Three, eight, zero.     Are you there?     So the Commission made a request for information on KPMG and then issued a summons in order to obtain the various reports.     And the reports at KPMG produced... we know they produced a final report in November.  That is attached to your declaration.  They produced two other reports.  The Progress Report on the 24t h of January.   That you will find at pages 380 running through to 400.  And then they produced, and this is referred to in your letter to the Public Protector which we will come to in a moment.   They produced an Interim Report at page 401 dated the 26t h of April 2011.  So a Progress Report, 24 July.  Oh, sorry 24 January.  An Interim Report, 26 April and then a Final Report in November.     Now you say in your declaration that the first report was done quickly and it is this report that was used by the board.  Presumable, you must be referring to the report of 24 January?     Yes.     Well, that is my very point.     So what was the first report that was used by the board in its deliberations?  Because this report would not have helped it.  It is progress report that sets out the mechanics and the manner in which KPMG and Nkonki is going to set about their task.       Mr Mkwanazi, I think you might be confusing yourself.     The paragraph that I have read to you, says that it was the first report of KPMG and Nkonki. You know that ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Sorry ...[intervenes]      Well, that is completely wrong.  You referred to this report in your letter to the Public Protector and that is in June.      Thank you.  Then you talked about an Internal Audit Report that you say you had.  That is the one attached to your affidavit, correct?  Is that ...[intervenes]      Yes but that was not before the board.  So what we ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Mr Mkwanazi.     What we do agree upon is that, as of the 16t h of February – and we are going to come to that board meeting.     The 16t h of February the board did not have any report from KPMG/Nkonki.  Correct?     Alright.  Now I want to ...[intervenes]      Well, we are lucky because we have got affidavits from many of your fellow directors and we will see in time what they say.       But let us start with the board meeting of the 25t h of January just to follow the chronology.  If you please go to 51.     Of Bundle 1 and to page 534.     543.  That is part of the minutes of a board meeting on the 25t h of January 2011.       And if you could please ...[intervenes]      Go to paragraph 4.1.6.       There is says the chairman, which is     But you gave no documents to your fellow directors.  You told them that, correct?     Yes.  But the point that I make Mr Mkwanazi is that you did not give your fellow directors any documents.  You simply told them that you are occupied with these 30 cases, correct?     Right?     Alright.  Then you could please go to paragraph 4.1.8?  Because I want to come to an important meeting ...[intervenes]      Well, 4.1.8 ...[intervenes]      Yes. “The chairman assured the board that the company was cooperating fully with the Public Protector.   He informed the board that he had a discussion with Mr Gama on 22 January on a proposed settlement agreement.”     Yes. “He advised the board that the matter will be deliberated on, that the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee and then recommend to the board for approval on 16 February.” So that was the route to the 16 February meeting.  First a meeting of the GCNC on the 3 r d of February, correct?     So let us go then to that meeting.       The meeting of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee on the 3rd of February.  Sorry, before I do that.  There are a few things I need to deal with.  There was another board meeting after the 25t h of January.  It was on the 1s t of February.     Let me just take you there.  Sorry, just give me a second.  Those minutes are at 916 of the same file.       Yes.       Yes.  And then if you could forward to 918.       And if you have a look at paragraph 4.1.10 towards the top of the page.     Yes. “The chairman stated that he was in settlement discussions with Mr Gama.  He stated that Mr Gama was only appealing the sentence that was imposed.  He added that the committee was currently reviewing Mr Gama’s sentence and the proposed settlement agreement will be presented to the board for approval  on 16 February 2011.” Now, what committee are you referring to there?     Now we know that something very important happened on the 2 nd of February.     And that is, Mr Todd... Sorry, is there something ...[intervenes]      I am not referring to ...[intervenes]      I am off that document Mr Mkwanazi.  Perhaps you can just concentrate on my question, please.       My question was.  What committee are you referring to there?     Okay thank you.  So Mr Mkwanazi, that is on the 1s t of February.  I now want to move to the 2n d of February.  I am off that minute now.     Alright.  On the 2 nd of February, Mr Todd produced his report.  You have seen that report?     Could we please go to Bundle 3?     Page...     Page...     65.     I take it you received a copy of this report?     Well, what you mean you think you did?     Right.  So you will see that it expands from 65 all the way through to 90.       Twenty-five pages of the report, correct?     A very comprehensive and detailed report.     This also was not music to your ears because at this point in time, you were opposed to reinstating Mr Gama, correct?     Ja.  Did you ever read this report?     H’m.  And what impression did you gain?  Was this a report of a competent attorney, someone who obviously who had a handle on the matter?     Was there anything missing from this report that you ...[intervenes]      It is all there?     When you read this report, did it leave any room to conclude that you were going to actually lose the arbitration?     Yes.     Yes, thank you.  So that is on the 2n d of February.  I now want to come to the meeting of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee on the 3rd of February.     I would like you please to go back to Bundle 1 and to turn up page 827.     [No audible reply]      Alright.  Now Mr Mkwanazi, you were the chairperson of that committee?     The other members were Ms Nyaka, Ms Tshepe and Mr Shaba, correct?     And we see under partial attendance, Mr Mapoma was present, correct?     Now if you go to page 828 over the page, you will see there is a heading.     You will see ...[intervenes]      Yes, over the page, please.     You will see there is a heading, 6.7, report back from the advert process.  I mean, what was happening here is the position, the vacant position of Transnet GCE was being advertised.     Correct?     And you would accept that much of this meeting was dedicated to whether or not Mr Gama should be allowed to put forward an application.     Or for his application to be ...[intervenes]      If we could then please go to page 830?     And there at paragraph 6.9 about halfway down, investigation by the Public Protector.     Yes. “Mr Mapoma took the committee through senior counsel’s opinion that was obtained with regard to Mr Gama’s application for the GCE position.  He highlighted that the legal opinion was based on the following three issues. 1. Does the guilty verdict against Mr Gama exclude him from being considered in the current GCE selection process underway? 2. How does the pending appeal decision affect the board decision to interview or not? 3. Does the Public Protector complaint currently being dealt with have a bearing on the selection process?” Do you confirm that?     Then the sub-paragraph    And then I am going to come back to that opinion and that clause. “Mr Mapoma further took the committee through the proposed settlement agreement between the company and Gama, stated that there was no agreement on the following issues, the date of reinstatement, the position to which Mr Gama would be reinstated, et cetera.” So essential to the business of this committee on the 3rd of February was this issue of Clause 4.8.4 of the recruitment policy, correct?     Now could I ask you please to now turn to Bundle 2?  Keep this bundle open where you are at file or Bundle 1 but then open as well ...[intervenes]      Bundle 2.     Page... let us first go to page 302.       Yes.  Are you there?     So this is the recruitment and selection policy.       And let me take you to... no doubt you are familiar with this.  Let me take you please to Clause 4.8.4 at page 307.     It says that at 483, just above that    And of course, the problem was that Mr Gama had been dismissed for conduct, right?     And the issue that then arose before the committee is whether one could depart from 4.8.4 on the basis of Clause 2.  And Clause 2 you will find at page 304.     Three, zero, four.     Under the heading scope. “This policy applies to all job applicants and employees of Transnet.  Transnet may, however, at its sole discretion deviate from the policy where necessary in respect of executive appointments.” So that was really the debate.  Do you remember that?     Now Mr Mapoma in his report to the committee, as we have seen, spoke of a senior counsel’s opinion.  Let me take you to that opinion.  You find that at page 293 of the same bundle.     If we go to paragraph 13 at page 297.     Counsel said    Alright.     298.     Paragraph 19.     Counsel said    May well not be rational.     Correct?     And would you agree with that?     Okay.  So let us then have a look at the decision of your committee.     For that you need to go to …[intervenes]     To bundle 1, yes.     If I can please …[intervenes]     …direct your attention – yes, we have looked at 830, I would like to go 831.     Well, I am not speaking.  Can you hear me?     Alright, so let us go please to  831 and to paragraph 6.3.13.  Are you there?     Deviation from clause 4.8.4    is that right?     Now does this minute reflect any consideration of the advice that you received from counsel that to interview someone who had admitted guilt …[intervenes]     Right.     It does not at face value?     Is it something that you considered?     Right.     Yes because of the settlement negotiations, correct?     But there is just a consideration of the settlement negotiations, there is no consideration of the fact that it may not be rational to interview a candidate who has conceded to having misconducted himself in his capacity as a Chief Executive Officer.  It is a great irony, you are actually settling with that person. Now consideration is given to that, is it?     But, you see, Mr Mkwanazi, is this not really the game, I mean was the truth not of the position that former President Zuma still wanted Mr Gama to be the Chief Executive of Transnet and in order to allow him to throw his hat into the ring, the first thing he needed to do was to deviate from 4.8.4 and that that is actually why you were settling with him, you were getting him back so he could go to this high office.  Is that not actually the objective?     Right?     But I just cannot understand how you could deviate from it in the circumstances of this matter.     I see.     But why did you not follow it at the time?  I mean, you asked for his advice.     Well, perhaps you are not in the same position and that you are not as compromised as you might otherwise have been ten years ago.  Is that not so?     Alright.  Well, let us then go to this debate and I assume you watched Mr Mapoma’s evidence on television because we are coming to that part of the transcript that he testified about.  Could you please turn to page 854 of bundle 1?  Eight five four.     And let me ask you to drop down to – you see on the left hand side there is numbering?     There is a 685 towards the bottom.  Can you just go up two lines from that and you see,     And you are asking Mr Mapoma to comment on that, correct?     Okay.  Then let us go over the page to 855 and Mr Mapoma says he is not appealing against the finding of guilt, he is appealing against the dismissal, now I said.   Do you see that?     Ms Tshepe says    Yes, well…     So what …[intervenes]     Ja.     Well, Mr Mkwanazi, is it not perhaps that you were caught off guard?  I mean, what you could not tell your fellow directors here is why you were settling.  Is it not because you did not want to tell them I am doing this because I have been told to by the minister.  You could not tell them that.  So you literally were gob smacked, you did not know what to say because here your legal man had said we are going to win this case and in fact he appears to have said well, that is why we postponed because we do not want that.     Alright.  Ja.  No, it is also late in the day, I do apologise.     Mr Mkwanazi, you were caught here, were you not, because Mr Mapoma, the person who you had brought in to deal with this, had now told your fellow board members you are actually going to win this case.  It put you in a bit of an awkward position, did it not, because of course you had already negotiated.     Yes, so you were in an awkward position, right?     and you were literally gob smacked, you did not know what to say.  You were caught off guard, correct?     Yes, absolutely.  And then what is insidious, I put to you, is look how you changed so quickly after you give it thought.  Though Tshepe says – you say     But that is really not my point, you went from I do not know to fifty/fifty within a sentence.     You see, Mr Mkwanazi, you had a different agenda here because settlement was not rational, it certainly was not rational in relation to your prospects of success, you had a different agenda, did you not?     I see.  Now what really shows up the board is the next paragraph.     Yes.     Well, it is a contradiction unless you know what was happening and the last thing you wanted to was to go to arbitration and win because you wanted the man not only reinstated but you wanted to give him a shot at becoming the Group Chief Executive and when you see it that way, it is not a contradiction at all.     yes.     But you see, Mr Mkwanazi, he knew what you were up to, he knew the game because you had told him right at the outset you had told him.     And that was his mindset, he knew what you were doing.     He knew that you told him that you had been instructed by someone above the ministry to reinstate Mr Gama.     Mr Mkwanazi, you are very good at sidelining issues.  I mean, the point is, it is not – the importance is not that it is logical, the importance is that it is also true, correct?     Yes.  Well, let me …[intervenes]     What I understand Mr Mapoma to be saying is that you could not go to arbitration because Mr Todd and his senior counsel was going to win that and that then would have thwarted the plan to get Mr Gama reinstated and also to allow him to have a shot at becoming the Group Chief Executive.  That is what he is saying, in effect.     Right.  And now only is it logical but it is also true because you had been instructed to reinstate Mr Gama, correct?     Yes.     Correct.  And here your chief legal adviser was telling you that you have got a very, very case.  In other words, that the sanction is fair.     So you had looked into it together with him and there is his conclusion, right?  So where to from here?     Let me take you to the next paragraph.  You have said – so Mr Mapoma says got a very, very good case.  Ms Tshepe says well, then I am confused, you say I do not know, then you say we have got     I see.  Is that how things really worked, Mr Mkwanazi?  I mean, here you have a person saying look, we have got a very, very good case.  You get a     Do you accept that upon reflection and reading this it truly is incredible?  I mean, this is – this is the work of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of Transnet.     Of which you were the Chairperson.     You could only have conducted yourself, I want to put to you in this way, if you had another objective.  Is that no so?     Well, at …[intervenes]     Thank you.  So that is then the 3 r d of February.  I would like now to take you back to Bundle 2.     Yes certainly from my side.     Bundle 2, I want to go to page 6 please, Mr Mkwanazi.      Yes.     This is a draft settlement agreement, if you go to page 10 you will see it was actually signed by Mr Gama on the 10 t h of February.  There were a couple of ...[intervenes]      A couple of minor amendments were made and it was subsequently signed, but the point is that it was signed before the Board meeting on the 16 t h of February, correct?     Yes thank you.     So the point I was making is that this agreement is signed by Mr Gama on the 10 t h of February, now you need of course some legal advice to sell this to the Board, it is to that legal advice that I want to turn now please.   Would you go to page 12, and you would have seen these documents, on Monday the 14 t h of February, so the Board meeting was on the 16 t h.     Mr Mapoma sends to Sbu Gule this     And do you also Mr Mapoma’s evidence that that was the two pager, and you can turn to page 3 earlier in this bundle, that was the advice that you sought if you look at paragraph 4 of the consultation note where you had said that what you were looking for was an opinion setting out that there was some unfairness towards Mr Gama.     You said he was trying to find here in this memo some unfairness.     Well what we do know is that Mr Mapoma in his two-pager does not deal with the unfairness of Mr Gama’s dismissal, does he?     If you have regard to Mr Mapoma’s two-pager ....     Certainly Chair.     Sorry I beg your pardon.  Mr Mkwanazi what I wanted to explore with you is that in Mr Mapoma’s two pager nowhere does he say that Mr Gama’s dismissal was unfair.     Yes, alright, I would like to take you please to paragraph 7 of his two pager at page 13.      So it says    Yes.      Yes.      But the point is that the decision to revisit the disciplinary proceedings was done not to review or to look at but to revisit was done with the support of the shareholder Ministers.  Is that right?       And then what Mr Mapoma does is he lists a whole lot of things, there was a Public Protector complaint, 9, there is risk of litigation 10, a judicial process he says it is extremely slow, 11, there have been acting appointment, 12, acting appointments good corporate governance relating to acting appointments.  Mr Gama is a highly experienced executive. And 15, we continue to incur legal costs.  Nowhere does he say this dismissal is unfair, does he?          Is that – were you surprised or are you surprised?     Okay, so now this was not the two pager you were looking for, correct?     Yes, so he passes it on someone then had to fill in the gaps.  So he passes this onto Deneys Reitz we know, alright …[intervene]     And then at page 13 they were asked     So this is what they say at 10    It is just like what you might find in textbooks, it says well reasonable people may emotionally have different views of sanction in given a particular set of facts.  Correct?     But it does not say anything in relation to Gama’s case.  Correct?     So then we are down to one single     So but that is the point and you landed up opting for an opinion of two sentences really that at most creates doubt and you opted to follow that opinion instead of the 25-page opinion of Mr Todd understandably.  Correct?     Yes, so at most all this does is create doubt but it does not tell you why, it does not say why.        Mr Mkwanazi it is extraordinary are you going to advance before this Commission that you legitimately and honestly settled Mr Gama’s case because you thought you had prospects of success at arbitration surely you cannot advance that proposition, on the strength of this two sentence “opinion”.  Mr Mkwanazi?          Yes, but none of that has any bearing on prospects of success.  What you were looking for was an opinion that shows some unfairness so that you could persuade your Board members to agree to the reinstatement of Mr Gama at the Board meeting of the 16 t h of February you yourself said that.  This is the best ...[intervenes]          It does not show unfairness it shows some doubt.  Correct, that is all?      No Mr Chair.     Ja thank you alright well so now we know that this is weak.  I just wanted to find out from you what did you do with this weak opinion did it serve before the Board because that is not something that is clear to me?      Could this opinion serve before the Board on the 16 t h…[intervene]     Remember your objective you told your attorneys on the 22 n d of January is that you need some friendly advice so that you can persuade the Board to reinstate Mr Gama at the meeting of the 16 t h of February.       Did you present this two and a half pager to the Board at the meeting of the 16 t h of February?      You think you did?     But this is very important Mr Mkwanazi because we need to know was it on the strength of this opinion and I am loathed to call it that because the advice is two sentences and it is unreason ...[intervenes]      Just bear with me so the Board decided to reinstate Mr Gama on the strength of this opinion.  Is that right?      So was this ever then put onto - I have not seen it in its final form was it put onto the Transnet letterhead or – I mean you can tell us what did you do with this because Mr Mapoma said he sent it to you.         Yes, but was it tabled as a Transnet opinion, your opinion, was it tabled as a Deneys Reitz, in what form was it tabled?       Bearing in mind Mr Mapoma was not at the Board meeting Mr Mapoma’s evidence is that he gave it to you.  So what did you do with it?     Okay and you say…[intervene]     But you see that makes it so much worse.  Are you suggesting that the committee may have decided this matter on the strength of his advice which was not even on Deneys Reitz letterhead?        So who was – so you present this opinion to the Board and I am sorry I am pressing you on this but whose advice did you present it as?       So you presented it as the advice of group legal?     It was only a few days before that Mr Mapoma had told some of those very directors the same directors that you had a very, very good case.      I mean honestly Mr Mkwanazi this is not legitimate is it not I mean I do not know why you do not just accept that you had another agenda.       Sorry?     And then of course the augmentation really makes your case worse and not better now let me show you why.  So if you go to page 19 this is where you find the augmented opinion 22 February.      Page 19 of Bundle 2.      One nine, so the first one and a half pages just sets out what happened during the negotiations then have a look at and read into the record please paragraph 1.1.     This is now the augmented improved opinion.  Please read that paragraph.    Yes please into the record.    So here you are told.    Ja. Well that is what I am saying it makes your case so much worse because in the augmented opinion now Deneys Reitz tell you about opinions from reputable firms all of which have come to the conclusion that Mr Gama’s prospects of success are not good.    But that still you carried on.    And then…    Mr Mkwanazi just to finish on this.  If you go to page 21 you say this is an attempt to augment.      But under the heading of Sanction that is precisely the same paragraph that was in – that was – that paragraph there is paragraph 10.    And the last paragraph was paragraph 11.  There is no improvement.    It seems that Deneys Reitz were not able to improve their advice.    Did you know why?    But it could not be improved upon because it seems that they were not of the mind that the dismissal was unfair.  In fact there is a massive contradiction is there not between what you find in 1.1.    And what you find in 4.    But despite that you pushed on.    Mr Chairperson I see that it is now six o’clock.    I think I still need quite a bit of time.    Because I have yet to go to the essence really of Mr Todd’s evidence.    And that is that.    None of these three charges were the things that were really capable of being condoned.    And then go and deal with that.  So…    If Mr Mkwanazi can come back on Monday.    Yes.    It is becoming increasingly difficult Mr Chair I must be honest.    Yes.    That would be.    [Inaudible].    Yes certainly Chair. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Good morning Chair.    Thank you Chairman.    Clearly Chairman.    Okay.  I am standing.  He is witnessing oh I need to go back.  Wait I need to remove this chair.    Ja.  Standing.    Mafika Edmund Mkwanazi.    I could not have an objection.    Yes.    So help me God.    I can put it on Chairman.    Okay.  Okay.    Mr Chairman I think anticipation of eats.    Good morning Advocate.    Yes.    Okay it is 4.  Okay is it written Exhibit BB18?    Yes I have got the one Exhibit BB18 and then on the second page it is an index BB18 then…    Then on the next page it is a declaration.    No I see that Advocate.    That is correct Advocate.    19, 20.  Yes I am at page 20.    I do confirm.    Correct.    Not yet I am at 21.412 yes.    Yes I see that.    I will confirm yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I do.    That is true.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes I think paragraph 4.2 confirms that I was approached by Minister Gigaba to join the board of Transnet sometime in December for a period of three years and also in that meeting with the – Mr Gigaba he indicated a few areas of concern.   One of those was a lack of transformation as there were very few senior positions held by African women.  The other she was under the impression that the procurement systems of Transnet was open to corruption by employees and other stakeholders.   He emphasised that as the incoming Chair of the board this must an area of focus.  He also somehow was aware of problems in the procurement of suppliers and services for mega projects in Transnet. These would have included Durban Harbour Entrance widening, the Cape Town Container Terminal, the new multipurpose pipeline, the Ngqura Container Terminal, the coal line expansion, the iron ore expansion and the    I think sometime in October.  I do not recall the date.    2010.    2010 yes.    Sho I thought it was October it is a long time ago but I really thought it was October.    Chairman your observation is correct but my recollection it was sometime in October.    And – yes – and I am not sure if the Minister has put in his own affidavit.  Maybe I am wrong Chairman.    It is a long time ago.    Oh.    That is my recollection Chair.    Yes Advocate unfortunately I have to read from this transcript. “Transnet has always had a detailed procurement procedure manual.  Even in 1996 there would have been a tender manual and tender board that gets amended from time to time. These guide the organisation on how to procure goods and services from time to time.  Our board the December 2010 – December 2014 board also amended the procurement procedure manual in 2011.  Transnet also has a delegation of authority frameworks for – that gets reviewed by a sub-committee and is approved by the Transnet board from time to time.  This delegation of authority framework defines the powers of the board, all sub-committees and executives generally up to the Group Chief Executive.  Then the Group Chief Executive has authority to sub-delegate to his or her executive committee. And these delegations of authority there are financial limits and other limits for all executives including the Transnet board. Some matters get elevated to the shareholder for approval following the guidelines in a shareholder compact.  In these financial limits executives can increase certain contract values by a defined percentage or not exceed contracts by a predetermined amount.  There are financial limits on appointment of consultants and other service providers. Should these be exceeded during execution the responsible executive must report to his or her manager so that the issue can be referred back to the divisional or Transnet Acquisitioning Council or the Transnet board if it was the original approval. In most cases the Transnet internal audit gets involved to determine a fruitless and wasteful expenditure.  This is how deviations in contracts are identified.  The structure that approved that contract must determine if the condonation is granted or not.  A line manager of the offender must take disciplinary action if warranted.” Can I continue?    That is correct.    I will not read the submission line by line but in a nutshell the – there was a strange – it is not strange it is part of the PPM by the way which the Procurement Procedure Manual which does allow for certain deviations but they need to be approved further up and also it allows for condonations. So what I was trying to sketch here and by the way the things that I mentioned in my submission are events of from 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.  I indicate that there were many deviations. There were many condonations and there is three that comes to mind because they were major. There is one on the appointment or the condonation of the VAE contract which somehow became irregular.  Because when the approval was done I think it was done at R980 million and by the time it reached my office as an acting Group CEO to – to for condonation the amount was R1.778 million which is R1.8 billion roughly. Now – and funny enough that particular contract implicated a lot of people in some irregular behaviour.  In that those people various teams in TFR, in Group kept on trying to fix this problem and they delayed.  I do not know why it took so long for them to bring this thing up to the board for condonation. But eventually it came to the Transnet board through my office for condonation and I then elevated the matter to the board and on elevating it I indicated that disciplinary action needs to be taken against – it was most probably plus or minus ten to twelve executives who had been involved in – some of it was worrisome.  It bordered on doing things without authority etcetera, etcetera. So yes it was brought to the board and a condonation was given by the board.  So that is a typical – but that is a big deviation.  And that is why it needed board approval. Another one which comes to mind besides the VAE contract is the HMG contract which the executives – it started as a flow contract.  Then about a year and a half into a flow contract they then changed it to a – a HMG contract.  But the processes followed were flawed and therefore it became an irregular contract. And in executing that contract certain elements of that contract were implemented irregularly and there is some element of fruitless and wasteful expenditure in that contract. It came from a division called Transnet Capital Projects and the CEO was Ms Moira Moses.  And of course even this contract the HMG had to come through certain processes and be looked at and a condonation sort of required.  Although the project itself was far bigger it is just the irregularity of it that required a condonation.  And in that process they – the Group CEO Brian Molefe was instructed to take disciplinary actions against not only Ms Moira Moses but maybe three to four other executives within Transnet Capital Projects. Then another big one which needed – now these condonations are now done in 2011 and yet these contracts were signed maybe in 2005/2006/2007. Another big one was in AWP Arab Wally Passes where for some reason they were also an engineering procurement construction management service provider. The contract there increased from about R1.7 billion to over R3 billion and again the board sometime in 2011 had to take a decision to condone and also specify that disciplinary action must be taken on those involved. Now I just mentioned these three but there were others.  Not too many because I am focussing on the big ones.  Small ones in the KPMG report are mentioned in – I am not sure how many in total there were but yes others condonation was granted others condonation was not granted.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I would confirm that and maybe let me add something that is not clearly covered there.  There were a few board meetings that were – happened in January.  And I do not have minutes of those etcetera.  But already before the end of January Transnet at the time had a funny environment where people were coming with allegations of this and the other.  So yes the matter that Nkonki covered even though the report was published – the final report was published in November.  The company knew already of some of these matters and I am also looking for that information because I did present some of that information to the board or a board sub-committee even before the end of January in terms of some of these.  And funny enough some of these are not even mentioned even in the KPMG report.  But I am aware of them because I then forwarded typically there was one which I forwarded to the Group Chief Executive of an irregular consulting contract by – by the then Group General Manager.  And yes I still do not have the list of all consulting contracts that were entered into by – I still do not have it today.  But at the time I was forwarded with what looked like an irregular contract and I handed it over to Mr Brian Molefe.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes.  That is correct.    Hundred percent correct but having said that there were reports like – there was a report published called by Transnet internal audit.  It was called Transnet or TFR Procurement Irregularities I think it was done in 2008.  I had seen that report.  But now when I ask for that report it is not available.  So the fact that I am using a November KPMG final report to me really is the fact that then KPMG had to go back and dig deeper of what happened as early as 2005/06/07/08 and ’09.       Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes.     I think AWP, Alan Wally Parson.     That is contract.     Wait, wait.  Condonation was granted on condition that the managers involved would be disciplined.     Yes.  Now, when an HMG condonation was granted, Brian Molefe was instructed to discipline Ms Mora Moses.  And I am not sure of the dynamics of those discussions but Ms Mora Moses immediately resigned.     Ja.     Also ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     That is correct.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes, that is correct but ...[intervenes]      But let me... I might have elevated that one to the board.  I do not recall now.     Ja.     Yes, it was applied for.     That is correct.     It is somewhere in the report.  I cannot... I am not sure but it is somewhere there.  I will have to find it myself.  Ja.  It is somewhere in there.     Yes.  It is actually in a board meeting... minute as well where... I think it was a June board meeting where now this condonation was elevated to the board and the board did condone the expenditure on AWP.  But let us come back to HMG.  Yes.     Not really.  Let us go to then paragraph 9.     Yes.  Should I read it?     Now, let me first... let me verbalise it.  From the view of... by the way, even this verbalisation, I think it maybe comes from the KPMG report, which was trying to indicate that on similar matters like Gama, the company was consistent in dealing with certain issues.   But then again, on similar matters like Gama, the company was not consistent in that there are other...  Now these matters are not identical, by the way.  We need to understand that.   Because if then you are looking for detail into what are these matters.  They are not the same.  They are not the same.  Ja.  In a nutshell, that is it. Now in a nutshell as well.  What I am trying to indicate and not with certainty is that.  Had Gama been given the opportunity to go through the condonation process, maybe the authority to condone might have come with a different sanction.   I do not know.  Maybe demotion.  Maybe dismissal.  I really do not know.  But there is that possibility that they are authorising individual, would have come to a different conclusion. Same as, we had asked as a board that those who were guilty of certain irregular and certain fruitless and wasteful expenditure contracts, must be disciplined.  I do not know the outcome of those disciplinary actions.     Yes.       Yes.     That is correct.     Can I comment?     That is why I say the outcome could have been that no company have been the same.  Even though it would have gone through whatever... ...[indistinct] application.  It could have been the same.       Yes.     I do not know.       I really do not know, ja.     Chairman, I did not because, as you could imagine, I am dealing with this matter almost seven months after Gama was dismissed. And there, I was not communicating with him or with anybody else.  But that would have been the duty of KPMG in my interpretation to find out if he did.  Ja, I do not know.  Ja.     That is correct.     Yes.     That is correct.     Yes, it is.     Within Transnet.     That is correct, Chairman.     That is correct, Chairman.     He should have known, yes.     Yes, Chairman.     Yes, I do Chairman.     Chairman, I do not have facts whether he did or whether he did not.     But when you look at the quantum of some of the condonations that we had to deal with which ran into billions of rands.  And those were granted subject to disciplinary action.  I do not have a record of whether did he or did he not.  I really do not have that report.     Yes.     Chairman, my interpretation is that the KPMG Forensic should have looked into whether he did or not.  That is why there is an element of doubt as well, whether it would have been granted or not granted that condonation.   And whether he would have been disciplined or not disciplined based on the other similar matters of contracts which ran into billions and no disciplinary action was taken against those individuals except in 2011 when the offences were committed in 2005.       I think it is fair Chairman.  And I emphasise with your position.  And then, of course, these things happened many years ago.  I still do not know if he did apply.  It will be of interest to still get that information whether did he apply or not.       And at Transnet, this application for condonation was a strange thing because at times, it came via Transnet Internal Audit.  And now, my recollection now as an executive which is maybe in 1996 of 1997.      In a situation like this, the request for a condonation would not just have come directly from the individual.  It would have come in partnership with the Transnet Internal Audit so that it is put on record that as you get this condonation you also get the final written warning.  That was the culture then but that is many, many years ago.     In Transnet itself.     That is correct.  As I indicate, there was a preliminary report by KPMG.  If you would recall, when Transnet responded to the Public Protector’s letter in April of 11.  There was a preliminary KPMG report attached.  Now, I have not seen that report.   And it is also true that even as early as... before the end of January, there was a KPMG preliminary report and other reports from Transnet Internal Audit on irregularities and procurement.  They are there.  Those reports were there.   And they articulated these relevant irregularities and also they articulated the wrongdoings, the sanctions, the no sanction.  So there was that element of doubt then that maybe there was a lack of consistency.       I... yes ...[intervenes]      In that, had he applied.     The outcome would have been different, ja.     That is correct.     That is correct.  But then having said you treat him with a doubt, you do not just do not leave it there.  Then you have got to deal with what type of sanction.  And would you then have given Mr Gama.     That is correct, yes.     Yes, I do .     He should have had.     He should have.     Definitely, he would have disclosed it, ja.     Ja.     Yes, I recall, ja.     That is correct.     I accept that, ja.     You are correct, Chairperson.     I accept that, Chair.     Yes.     I accept that, Chair.     Chairman, your observation is correct.  And also, then Chairman, it is a stringent environment at Transnet in that... I am not sure how many condonations were granted every year in that organisation.     And I am not sure but it was quite common.  But that he did not take that advantage in terms of that, I do not know why he did not do it.  Ja.     Chairman, I agree with you but the board at the time, viewed a lot of other similar cases were done in 05/2006 and they hung on unresolved with no condonation for five, six years and those condonations get applied for in 2011 because at that time in 2011 we pushed through a communication in the organisation that this condonation must come to a halt and also we elevated the authority to allow condonations to the office of the Group Chief Executive only and on top of that we requested that each and every irregularity in procurement must be reported to the board and to the audit committee regularly because these things have got an impact on how we report our annual financial statements and also, if I recall in terms of these irregularities, we then even said that we will voluntarily report then to the shareholder because they were an embarrassment to the organisation.     I agree with you, Chair.     Ja.     Worse than not, not necessarily a final written warning, maybe worse than that, maybe dismissal, maybe demotion, whatever the people dealing with it would have decided but maybe worse than that, yes.     The reinstatement comes from a view that there were similar cases or even worse cases where no disciplinary action was taken for six year on these cases.     I do not know – I do not know in terms of – I am losing my thoughts a little bit, can you come back, Advocate?     [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     That is correct at the time when this thing was being dealt with but, as I indicate, there were close to 22 other executives who maybe could have done something similar and based on that sentiment that here are these 22 other executives who have not even been disciplined and also based on discussions and engagements with the board then that decision was taken that maybe a reinstatement with a – ja, with a limited sanction is appropriate, ja.     That is correct.     That is correct, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I think they were dismissed.     Yes, I do, he was the CEO of TFR.     He was the CEO of TFR.     No, I have not.     Okay.      I have not read it, ja.     I am not sure if I was there at the time.  What year was it, if I can be reminded?     I was not there.     No, we were not informed of those two employees, yes.     I did know about it much, much later, yes.     No, I did not.     It might have been, yes, because I would have had to look at the facts, etcetera, etcetera and even the motivation to the board would have been different.      But on the same matter these individuals already have been dismissed and the motivation would have been completely different.     No, I do not recall but it would not have been a few months, it was much later when one was reading about some of the goings on in Transnet and in former employees because there were many others, by the way, there were many things going on there at the time.     Advocate, you are correct, I did focus on inconsistencies because my line of thinking was why is this individual – when we say my line, even my submissions to the board and discussions with the board, why is this individual unfairly prejudiced when there are 22 others who should have gone through the same experience and nothing has happened to these?  That was my line of thinking at the time and that is the motivation I submitted to the board.   And also at the time, as well, I was getting dossiers, if I can use the word, on a lot of irregularities in the organisation during the month of January 2010.     We – hold it, we did ask Brian Molefe to discipline them.     As a board.  I do not know if he did do that, I do not have feedback on that but I am aware he tried to discipline two and he did discipline one, Gary Kita(?) if I recall and I do not know about the others.  We never followed up with Mr Brian Molefe.     The point is valid, we did it the other way around because we were sensing unfairness on the sanction of dismissal, yes.     That is correct, Chairman.     That is correct, Chairman, yes.     I agree, Chairman, yes.     Chairman, you almost need to take the discussion a little bit back.  I agree that Mr Gama was dismissed fairly in terms of the processes but the question is, had there been a process of him even applying for that condonation, the outcome might have been different.  The outcome could have been the same, frankly, or the outcome could have been he is demoted, the outcome – I do not know what the outcome could have been but because for whatever reason, his issue did not go through a condonation process.  Yes, the outcome that came out, came out as per - Advocate [indistinct] 13.57.     That is correct.     Ja.     I cannot say that, no, no.  Ja.     Chairman, I think I will repeat myself.  It is a what if.  Typically – say Mr Gama had applied for condonation and say the outcome of that application was you are going to be disciplined and the outcome of that disciplinary process is a dismissal, that is fair, Chairman, because he had an opportunity to apply for that condonation.   Your points about did he apply or did he not apply, was it was granted or was it not granted are valid, Chairman, I agree with you fully and being a senior executive, that he was, your points are valid.     Chairman, there are two stages that the board is trying to explain.  The one is that there was a process of condonation within the Transnet but that condonation did not imply that you will not be disciplined. Now knowing that there was this system of condonation then the question was when this Gama matter was dealt with, there were many other cases where condonation had not even been applied for, but I am going back to an argument that Advocate Myburgh touched on, that we do not know whether Gama would have been granted condonation.  Even if he would have been granted, it would have been subject to disciplinary action and the outcome of that disciplinary action, we do not know what it could have been.  Could have been a demotion, a dismissal, etcetera.   So that was our thinking then.  Now in fairness to what you are saying, the board would have had no ground if a condonation process had been done by Mr Gama to deal with these matters.  That board would not have had any grounds.  But that board, as well, would have had to deal with the 22 other cases which originate as early as 2005 and that board did try to do that.  I am not sure how far Brian Molefe went but the board did try to deal with those.     That is correct.     No [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] to that.     I agree with …[intervenes]     I accept that, ja.     It comes in, Chairman, in that  - the process was incomplete in that the issue of condonation should have been tabled by him post this matter being elevated but it looks like he did not and now then this board looks at this and says had he applied for condonation, the outcome have been different – it might not have been different, yes, I agree with you.     Chairman, I do not have my facts whether he applied or not.  I do not have my facts.     That is correct, Chairman.     I agree, Chairman.     Chairman, I do not know if he applied or not.  I still do not know, Chairman.  But based on the record of the proceedings and also maybe whatever submission his attorney would have made, it looks like he did not apply.     Ja, I agree, Chairman.     I agree, Chairman.  Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh, I know that I interrupted you but I know that you have not forgotten your questions.     Thank you, Chairman.  Thank you, Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    I am there.     Yes, that is correct, but also let us not forget that by the time we were dealing with this matter Gama had taken the matter to the Transnet Bargaining Council and in view of that then the Board had engaged Deneys Reitz etcetera, etcetera, for advice on what you may call the winability of this case at the Bargaining Council, but yes I do accept that Gama should have applied for condonation, ja.     Okay.      I agree, yes.      That is correct, ja.      We have dealt with that, yes.      That is correct.      With the help of external lawyers, yes.      Not really I was the lead negotiator if I can put it that way but in the process I was advised by Deneys Reitz.      That is correct.      That is correct, yes I do.      Yes, asked by who by the way?     Oh, yes.      Why do I not deal with – are you talking about the letter from the Commission?     Ja.     Oh, okay, yes I found it yes.      Yes.      Yes.     If I recall I might not have addressed it but if I recall I wanted to submit a supplementary affidavit here which I have not yet done and the idea was that I would deal with those issues in more detail.        No, I do not think I have.      I do not think I have, yes.      No, no I can look at the issues that are on that request for an affidavit, yes.     In my affidavit that I have got in front of me I do not deal with those issues but I did indicate to my lawyer that I wanted to make a supplementary affidavit.      No, I did not say anything, yes.      A long time ago and in actual fact I have got a draft but my lawyers are supposed to have a look at it first before it comes to the Commission.      That is correct I do not know the date of that one but it is dated Chair.      That is correct.      That is correct.      That is correct.      The number is actually higher but let us remain with 12 but yes there could be 22 because then I have got to go back and take them out by line item or by name but I am happy with 12.      Ja, I say 12 but I am saying it could be higher.      I will have to go back to the report and actually generate a list.       It is Deneys Reitz.      Yes.      There were two pieces of opinion by Deneys Reitz if I recall.  There was one which you call an abridged version and then there was another one which was a more detailed version substantiating what was in the abridged version, yes.      That is correct, yes.      At this stage – you are going to come back to the Deneys Reitz and things, I take it?     Okay good.      Bundle 2.      Okay I have got Bundle 2 in front of me.      Page 216?     I have got it, yes.      I am there, yes.     Yes, I have never seen it in this way but I have read about it, ja.       Okay.      I see that.      Which line is that, can I – advocate what paragraph?     Yes.      That is correct.      That is correct.      Yes, I knew.      I did not know that in detail but I know it now having read what I am reading.      That is correct advocate, Chair.      That is correct.      Bundle 4A?     Okay thank you, yes I am on page 4.  ADV MYBURGH     Yes.      The answer is no it does not surprise me because maybe some of these were already in the media or maybe he had some inside information say from Transnet on what could have been happening in procurement.      Yes, it was and maybe even more in the media but yes it was in the media.       Yes, I was aware of that.      Yes I see that paragraph.      You know advocate you need to understand how State owned entities operate.  They operate in very strange ways where within this entities some of these Ministers have got sources of information particularly these big SOC’s like say Eskom, Transnet and I do not know who else but I suspect somebody inside the organisation would have briefed the Minister about that or maybe even outside of the organisation in that case I am assuming that it could have been Gama himself.        That is what I mean Chairman.     That is what I mean Chairman maybe to take it a little bit further Chairman you will have to understand that some of these Ministers and members of parliament have got companies that somehow I suspect they have got an interest in what is happening in these companies.      In these State owned entities so which is why they have an interest of tender opportunities if I can use the word of whether did they exist or not.        Yes.     That is correct Chairman.      That is correct Chairman.     Yes, I did let me maybe expand on this the Chairman will recall that at some stage while Mr Gama was on suspension Mr Gama was lobbying virtually many Ministers.  I do not know which ones now but yes therefore my assumption is that maybe he had shared this or if it was not him it could have been any other employee because the employees in these State owned entities are strange animals to a certain extent because they have got certain direct lines to Ministers to which even me as the Chairman at the time might not have had.      It was in the news.      Okay, two five three, wait two five three is it Ms Barbara Hogan’s bundle?     I see that.     He did.    In my opening line or paragraph I do indicate that I met Mr Gigaba towards the end of October.  And amongst a number of issues he was talking about transformation in the context of black suppliers not been given an opportunity particularly black legal firms and also African women not being elevated to top positions. And of course he mentioned the Gama matter and felt that the sanction in the Gama matter was too harsh or something because there was this condonation process at Transnet that had not been followed.  He did mention something.    Yes I did.    No it is there.  Let me check.  What folder it is in here.    If you read on page 4 of my submission.    Paragraph 4.3.4.   “He was under the impression that these matters at Transnet were racially biased and that there was a condonation process at Transnet that was generally used to deal with deviations within Transnet.”    I – that is correct as one of the matters yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chairperson yes.    He was basically trying to indicate that there was racial bias against African executives.    In Transnet in that African executives.    Were dismissed in disciplinary issues and yet white executives.    Were not even charged or disciplined.    In procurement issues ja.    He was not specific that it should be looked into but he was generalising that there was this process etcetera, etcetera.    And here is this executive who has now been dismissed.    He was basing it on the Public Protector letter as well if I recall.    And yes there was by that time there was a Public Protector letter on the 22n d December.    No he did not refer to it at all.  No – I might be mixing things here.  Because the letter of the Public Protector only came out on the 22 nd.    And the letter from Member of Parliament Vytjie Mentoor came on the 4 December.    So it – there would be no linkage.    In a nutshell what he was trying to say was white executives get away with serious – much more serious offences.    That is correct.    That is correct.    As a board yes.    Yes.    At the time no but I am aware that Mr Gama had met the other Minsters and even met the President if I recall based on even Ms Barbara Hogan’s submission.  I was aware that Mr Gama was running all over the show trying to get sympathy from various organisations.    Oh please Advocate how could you [not audible].    No, no, no.  I did not ask him, he did not volunteer as well, no.    Got no clue.    No.    Not necessarily reinstatement.  The question was the fairness or unfairness of that process which I did then pose to my legal advisors later on and they looked at it from two ways if I recall who was Deneys Reitz the fairness of the process itself and they concluded that the process was fair.  And then my legal advisors as well the fairness of the sanction and the fact that the matter was now going through Transnet Bargaining Council and therefore weighing the odds of winning or losing at the Transnet Bargaining Council.  Those are the two things that they said – Reitz helped me with if I recall and then later they helped to draft a letter to respond to the Public Protector on some of the related issues.    Yes.    Not really it was not clear to me.  You need to understand that in my negotiations with the sub-committee of the board of this so called settlement at some stage I wanted Gama to take a demotion and at some stage as part of the negotiations.  I put in various things.  I had refused to offer him whatever positions he thought he would get. So I do not think that could have been something that he thought I would do.  But yes I – as I looked into it on behalf of the board I had to look at the fairness, unfairness and the probability of winning or losing at the Bargaining Council.    Yes.    Not necessarily a settlement because    I think so.  I think he did indicate that …    It was – he felt it was unfair.    Yes.    I would agree with it but he did understand the dynamics of a disciplinary process and also the outcomes.    He did not understand that.    Ja.    No.  He did not say that he should not have been dismissed.  It was …    Ja.    No…    Chairman I agree with your interpretation but then there is a different interpretation that then says even in reviewing that process with Deneys Reitz the outcome could have been different.    Ja.    Of racism?    Yes.      Yes.    He did not choose those words, no.    No unfair was the word.    Unfair was the word.    And therefore that is why as well when I briefed Deneys Reitz I briefed him on the basis of unfairness on two issues.  On the process itself which they came out and said it was fair.  And then on the sanction itself then they – they also created doubt in view of the fact that this thing was now going to the Transnet Bargaining Council.    Let – let me explain where the harsh comes from.    When we were deliberating at board in February or late January that is where the statement of harsh was coming from – from some other board members.      Yes that statement did come up.    Maybe but I am aware that the board – some members of the board did propose that and even the resolution of the board did capture such a statement.    Ja.    He might have thought that ja.    He did Chair.    He thought that yes I agree.    What page is that?    Is it Bundle 4?    It could have been December 2010.    Or December 13.    I am not sure now.    Middle of December.    Yes.    That is correct.    Can I go to Bundle 2?  Okay.  Page 24.    Okay.  Page 24.    That is correct.    It was unfair.    To me he was questioning the unfairness.    Yes.    No continue Chairman.    No I am there Chairman.    Paragraph 4.3.4.    Yes.    Yes I have got it.    That is correct.    Chairman your analysis is correct. The basis was condonation and the fact that the matter now was going to the Transnet Bargaining Council and there was doubt whether we would win the case as it goes to the Bargaining Council.  Yes.    That is correct.    There is a link yes.    Yes.  I have got it in front of me.    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    No, No Chairman nothing.    That is correct.    Bundle 1 page 800?    I have got it here.    I see that.    I co-signed that document.    My signature is at the bottom yes.  I do not recall if I attended it but I co-signed that document.    Yes.  I do not recall the meeting.    Yes. ADV MYBURGH    That is correct yes.    It is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.  Yes.    Not in that fashion.  The instruction was can you look at the fairness or unfairness of the Gama disciplinary.     That was my understanding in terms of the shareholder instruction.  It was not inviting.       That is correct, Chairperson.  That is correct.     You... I am not sure.  Can you continue?     Yes.     I am not sure.  Is the fairness or unfairness.  Yes, correct.     I think I touched on it a little bit in my opening remark in paragraph 1.3.4.  Is that, he felt that the disciplinary process on Gama was unfair based on his assumption that white executives who did similar offences were never dismissed but he did not have facts.  He was just questioning the unfairness.   So then, I took that request to look at unfairness to Siyabola(?), Mapoma and also to Deneys Reitz.  And also knowing very well that now there was this Transnet Bargaining Council.   Yes, I did have a meeting with Deneys Reitz [poor connection – unclear] to look at that unfairness ...[intervenes]      Yes.     I would not call it a review but ...[intervenes]      ...as a view to review the fairness or unfairness of the dismissal.     [poor connection – unclear]     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct.     That is correct.  He racialised it.     That is correct.     The reference to process?     Chairman, that is a good summary.  Thank you.     That is correct, Chairman.     Maybe not because at times, this could have been a shareholder instruction.  But then, that is why I had to follow a certain process to try and address his fairness or unfairness.     I think it was.     But having said that.  You... we need to understand a certain technicality because he was not yet the minister or end of October.  I think he became minister 1s t of November 2010.  Yes.  But I construed it as a shareholder request.     [No audible reply]      I was under that impression, yes.     I was under that impression, yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Page 30.  Yes, I am on page 30.     Not... I do not recall that.     Yes.     I disagree with the statement in terms of a few issues.  The word instructed is too strong a word.  The word that maybe would be appropriate to review the fairness of the Gama matter.  And also, the word to say that I assume that it must have been former President Zuma.  It is his assumption.     Yes.     No ...[intervenes]      No.  Even if he had said that, I did not say that.  And I do not operate... I do not name-drop, particularly President Zuma.  I do not name-drop that person because I have never met him, et cetera, et cetera.  Ja.      No, I did not, ja.     I did not.     No.     No, he got it completely wrong.  He really got it completely wrong.     I was close to Mr Mapoma.  Let me admit that, ja.     He is correct.  You need to understand the [poor connection – unclear] environment when that board came in.  We must have interacted as board with Mr Mapoma in a period of maybe three months on 40 to 50 legal matters.       And on all of these, we kept on working with him.     And also requesting him to consult other lawyers to help us as a board to look into certain things.  There were many, many matters.     And what is interesting as well.  For some reason, I do not have records of the January interactions that the board had with Mr Mapoma.     And of course, [poor connection – unclear]     Ja.     Yes, but ...[intervenes]      Let me indicate that the instruction was to review, not reinstate.  And also, the word cleanly is almost like legally.  Looking through the legalities of the issues.     Meant legally.     That is correct.     The review, yes.     No.     That is correct.     That is why I was indicating that there was a supplementary affidavit which I had prepared many weeks ago and it was sitting with my legal advisor so that they review it and I submit it.  I would have touched on those points there.       It... that is correct.     I do want to submit... I still want to submit a supplementary affidavit which covers some of the points that I know I clearly had not addressed ...[intervenes]      ...in terms of a memo I got on the 28t h of July, if I recall.     I would like to do it, yes.     No, not to my knowledge.  No.  No.     Ja, if you pose the question that way.  Then definitely Mr Gigaba in my interaction with him end of     No ...[intervenes]      No, but ...[intervenes]      Yes, I did indicate that there is a supplementary affidavit coming.     In my declaration, I do indicate that I did meet Minister Gigaba on a certain date.  And also, in the declaration that you have, I did not address all the matters you raised in a memo of the 28t h of July.  I have got a draft.  It is sitting with my lawyer right now.     Advocate, I am here.     Which bundle is it?     That is correct.     I think so, just after, towards the end of the month.     Of January.     Later in the month, I think.     Do not forget that besides the KPMG report there were other reports that I was privileged to at the time.  That related to what you can call Transnet internal audit reports, one or two which I may not have right now.  Yes.     Can you repeat?     Oh.  Let me explain it that when this matter started indicating that the matter must now go to the Transnet bargaining council, that was then but I only appointed Sbu Gule fairly late in January but that matter of this thing going to the Transnet bargaining council was already there as early as 2010 or October.  Yes.     Oh.     I must have advised by Mr Mapoma because I roughly – I am aware that he was running with a big panel of lawyers that can do work at Transnet.     That is correct.  It is correct.     It could have been as well but I do not recall because my linkages on legal issues were always with Mr Mapoma.     Bundle 1, yes.     Page 170.     Yes.     Yes, I know Mr Mahlangu.     To the minister, that is correct.       Yes.     I think it could have happened, that is correct, ja.     That is correct.     Yes, 178, ja.     Yes.     Yes.     I see that statement.     I would not call it settlement because first I would have had to go through a review.     I see what is written, yes.     Yes.     I am there.     No, that statement is taking the matter ahead of where it was.     The matter was maybe a week away from that date because the matter had to be dealt with by Deneys Reitz and Mapoma in terms of my understanding of what I was trying to do or what the instruction might have been to review.     He would have got it from me that the matter is going to be looked into by the firm and also by Mr Mapoma and the board.     Ja but that is just premature in my interpretation.     To a certain extent, as it stands here, it is premature.  He could have said that towards the end of January after I had interacted the external legal advice.     It is false.     Ja.     No, we have not.     No, we had not decided.  Yes.     Do not forget even though we could have discussed a law firm, I could only do a law firm issue through Mr Mapoma and we only met with that law firm -that briefed that law firm, if I am not mistaken, after that date.  So that is why I say his conclusion is seriously premature.     No, no, no.     I am not sure – Chairman, I do not understand what Mahlangu was indicating.  Yes, he did suggest the law firms, Sbu Gule, and then I interacted with Mapoma because I do not deal with the law firm issues and a meeting was then set up between myself, Mapoma and that law firm to try and address this minister ’s instruction of was this process unfair.   So yes, I did meet Sbu Gule but at a later date than that.     It could have been in a telephone because I got the recommendation of Sbu Gule as a specialist lawyer because already I was asking around.  So it could have been a few weeks before and then he suggested Sbu Gule and through that Mr Mapoma and myself approached Sbu Gule and we discussed the matter but that was far later than the 18 January.     Because you need to understand the funny dynamic with these special advisers, they phone you any time.     He did.  He did, ja.     And other matters, yes, he did.     Ja, to his minister.     Chairman, it is not what you would call legal work, it was requesting information in the organisation about certain matters of procurement relating to what you can call not following processes of proper procurement and there were a couple of reports already in the organisation.  One was a 2008 report and it could have been another report which were addressing these procurement irregularities.     I asked for inside the organisation.     And I did get at the time.     And yes, I did have some reports.     Not in detail because they were fairly big reports, on average maybe 100 pages each and done by Transnet internal audit, so they were fairly detailed.     But they did articulate what you can call procurement irregularities that had taken place not just – that one report I recall spoke to 2008 or was published in 08.     And the other could have been another report but I have asked for those reports, funny enough, recently, and nobody is giving me that report.     On the dismissal matter, as I indicate somewhere, I did not see any unfairness.     But what I was looking for was were there similar things done in the organisation.  That is why that report talks to Transnet procurement – the title is irregular Transnet procurement of officer in time period.     So it was more on the irregular procurement issues.     Not on the unfairness of the dismissal, etcetera, etcetera, ja.     I am not sure, hopefully he will answer.  He is coming next week and he will answer.  But yes, he did advise me to talk to Sbu Gule and I discussed that with Mr [indistinct] 20.23 Maponya(?) and we met with Sbu Gule at a particular time and we discussed various things with Sbu Gule.       I cannot talk for Mr Mahlangu.     But yes, we met regularly, we spoke over the phone.     Yes, he did.     Yes.     Ja.  Ja.     Yes, in terms of advice which legal firm to look into as one of the legal firms which advice I then discussed with Mr Mapoma and Mapoma then set up a meeting for me to meet Deneys Reitz or something, yes. But I do not recall Mr Mahlangu giving me feedback that he has spoken to Mapoma, I do not recall.     Mr Mapoma might have said so, I do not recall.     But yes, I did speak to Mr Mapoma actually once every two days.     During conversation, ja.     Yes.     File?     Bundle 3, okay.  I have got it, what page?     Okay, I have got that.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, I see that.     I did instruct Selinga in view of the fact that I wanted to entertain this meeting with this other company to look at the matter of this unfairness that was raised by the shareholder.  That is why I did – just to put a stop into it until Deneys Reitz and others have looked into this matter.       Yes.     Yes I did but I wanted to exploit almost the shareholder instruction of is this unfair, etcetera, and in view of time I had not yet met Deneys Reitz to look into that matter.  Yes, I did request that [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Can you repeat?     That is correct.     To review the unfairness or fairness of that process, yes.     I did put it on hold, yes.     I felt comfortable in taking this decision, I did not consult with the board on that.     To postpone, yes.  It has not put a stop to postpone so that I review this request of unfairness or whatever it was, yes.     I needed to be satisfied in addressing what I called that shareholder request of looking to the unfairness of that process.     Yes there was this new request which was saying please look into the unfairness or fairness of this process and in order to do that I have got to consult some legal opinion or firm and unfortunately the calendar of events were such that my consultation could only take place towards the end of the month so that is why I had to request that they stop these processes until I had consulted Deneys Reitz.     Chairman I understand what you are saying and there is – but then from my looking at the Gama matter and maybe looking at some elements of his contract of employment I don’t know if it is linked but yes I understand your interpretation of the court judgment yes.     Wait Bundle 2, can we go back. Sorry bundle 2, I believe this is the one  yes.  Yes I am there.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes I do.     It is so.     He was ahead of himself ja, on the 18 t h of January.     I do not recall.        It looks like it would have been but truly I do not recall, ja.     I do not recall.     I was the lead negotiator yes.     I do not recall no, I do not recall, ja.    Yes I see that.      My assumption was that again based on what I called the shareholder view was there an unfairness in the Gama matter, yes.     Don’t forget yes I did indicate that because also deep down in me there was an element of doubt on if – not of the sanction, not of the guilty or not guilty, or not guilty, that is fair, but of the sanction in view of the fact that by that time if I recall, and unfortunately these reports are still not available, there were many other cases where similar procurement irregularities were not even investigated, some they didn’t even bother to apply for condonation, so that is the issue, the angle I was coming from.      I think I did.       I did ja.       That is correct.     Yes I did.     That was my attitude which needed support from a legal perspective that these were the unfairness, not the dismissal issue but the unfairness of the whole process of other executives not even being warned, things just happened and things were forgotten for years and years on end.     The process was extremely fair, I don’t have a problem with it.     On the facts in relation to the charges of which he was found guilty is the position that you accepted that dismissal was appropriate, the only thing that made you to want to bring him back was simply these other cases of other people, or is the position that you thought that the sanction of dismissal given the acts of misconduct of which he had been found guilty was too harsh irrespective of what had happened to other people, or is the position that had there been no such other cases that you are talking about you would have had no problem with the sanction of dismissal for an executive found guilty of this?     I agree with you fully Chairman, it is a strange situation in that here is this individual, I don’t know how many managers were there, maybe at the time maybe 2 000 managers who a few others like him had done similar things, not even a warning for years and years and then here comes this individual who does something similar to what other managers have done and this particular – it was a question of consistency in that my interpretation was in that organisation there was no consistency at the time.  Had there been similar cases which had been handled the same way as the Gama matter I would have had no problem whatsoever.     From the individual handling of the matter it was fair.     Yes I do but ...[intervenes]      But let me ...[intervenes]      Oh yes I do.     Oh no I do remember, but now that is why at some stage I would like the Commission to call in KPMG to present the report that I saw because in that report they spoke to 22 other individuals where nothing was done, I do agree that those are two individuals I agree, but I am saying what about the other 22 or more who were not dismissed or even a warning given against.     Chairman I did make a few examples of these big condonements, one was an increase in contract price from R980million to R1.8billion.     One was an increase ...[intervenes]      Yes.     That is correct.    Chairman I cannot fault your argument, you are correct.     Let me indicate that yes there were these one on ones, for some reason unknown to me Mr Gama was not comfortable to be in meetings with other people except myself and of course even in those one-on-one meetings we – me and Mr Gama didn’t agree on a lot of issues.     Chairman let me – you know at times when you start a meeting you want some background information from the people who are presenting the information to you, so it was part of that, I knew what is happening but almost like sketch the background of this situation to me.     I had a good idea.     Not really.     Not really.     Yes Advocate, Chairman I knew.     It is the GNS contract where he exceeded his authority in terms of a confining this thing to GNS when it should have gone out on open tender and also he exceeded his delegated authority on such matters.  If I recall his authority allowed him to only contract up to R10million and if I recall that contract was close to R90million, but the time it was terminated. Then the other matter was the Fifty-like-new locomotives where a Board decision was taken that the refurbishment of these fifty like new locomotives would be done by  Transnet Engineering, and then he and I don’t know who else decided that it would be done by an outside company which somehow from where I set it introduces fruitless and wasteful expenditure because that company must then set itself up when Transnet Engineering has got all the infrastructure to handle a refurbishment of the 50 like new, those were the two occasions.  Then of course the third one was this issue of attacking his colleagues.  Now let me just continue a little bit, if this was an isolated case and all other cases in the company were handled in a similar fashion I would have dismissed as well.     No, not really.     No not really.     No when I saw other cases not related to the gravity of the offence but just related to the fact that he exceeded, he has done a lot of irregular things in those things.   Now I am saying if it was a norm at Transnet to discipline people in that fashion not the two ...[indistinct] and the other, all the others from say 2005 to discipline them, to get rid of them, to do whatever I would have had no problem of Gama being dismissed.     No I have got an idea of the third charge as well, where he publically started attacking other executives.     Yes.     That is unacceptable.     And the Board, that is unacceptable.     I wouldn’t know, that you would have to ask Mr Mapoma because whenever I would meet, I never met Mr Gama alone outside of these meetings, so I will have to ask Mr Mapoma because for some reason I would insist that Mr Mapoma comes with me to such meetings, I don’t know how many meetings we had.     Then that’s the meeting yes, I wouldn’t have met him even socially I wouldn’t have met him.     That is correct Chair.     He did ask and I did agree.     No I did not, no I did not ask him but what I sense there, I am now assuming, there was a lot of media leakage around Transnet issues at that time and what I suspect maybe he was trying to do was to limit the media leakage of some of these discussions.     Chairperson I do not know because even my feedback to those meetings were actually feedback on what could  have been discussed or what options are there, etcetera, etcetera.     I suspend that – let me check – I suspect that Mr Mapoma might have got his facts wrong there, because that position of Transnet Group Chief Executive was a position where there was a parallel process to interview etcetera, etcetera, so I suspect what Mr Mapoma might have meant is a position of Chief Executive Transnet Freight Rail, I suspect that is what he meant.     You did sir I recall.     Well Mr Mapoma said that and I suspect Mr Gama might have said that but clearly Chairman I could never agree to a position like that.   I know in actual fact I was looking at agreeing to something more etcetera, etcetera.     I agree Chair I am not sure.     But I would not have agreed to it Chair.     No, no Chairman I couldn’t.     Yes I on page 17, page 18.  I am on page 18 Chairman.     That’s correct.     That is correct.     Bundle 3?     No this is Bundle 1, what bundle is that, this is Bundle 2, this is Bundle 3, yes I have got that.     Page?     Okay I have got it, okay.  I am on page 88.     Yes.     Yes can I – I am on page 88 above paragraph 60.     Ja, I see that line, I see that line yes, this charge.     This charge?      Yes.    I agree with that.    I agree with that.    In my interpretation.    In – it is consequential thing that came about because of the first two main charges.  But I agree with that sentiment.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Chairman my interpretation of the two main charges the GNS and Fifty like new. They then lead to this inappropriate behaviour by this executive and therefore I – that is why my focus was on the first two key charges and because if then the first two had been dealt with in a particular route the third charge might not have arisen.  That is where I come from.    On the last point.    Yes.    On this unbecoming behaviour.    On the last matter but on the other two matters there is ground to indicate that there could have been grounds for a different view in terms of the fairness of the system in handling the Fifty like new and the GNS contract.  But on the matter of how he then dealt with the executives and the board I agree my board did not apply a – a lot of – what you can call attention to that matter.    I am not sure if – it is an oversight Advocate Myburgh but there was no focus on that third charge it is an oversight.    Not fully but in dealing with the third matter.    Ja.    Advocate Myburgh that is your view.    The question – do not forget now that after taking the ill-advise from this firm who then told witnesses in our case at Transnet Bargaining Council and we then had doubt as the board that we could actually win this matter at Transnet Bargaining Council therefore we opted to – to settle.    They created doubt Chairman.  Maybe I used the – a strong word.  It comprehensive Deneys Reitz legal opinion post the first summary one which had been given to the board.    That is correct my stand is that board applied its mind and it saw some elements of doubt that it would win at Bargaining Council and then took a decision to settle.    Ja that is correct.    Yes I do.    Chairman I understand where you come from.  Now if you take the issue a little bit back that yes there were four charges.  Yes the fourth one was this one of unbecoming behaviour by the executive. But then if you look at it from perspective that says what created that charge are    But I agree with your analysis.    I agree with your analysis Chairman.   Of which bundle?    Yes.    I understand Chairman.    Yes.    That is correct.    On page 5?    Right I see it.  I see that.    Yes.    Page 107.  I am there.  Now Mr Mkwanazi I take it that you – you knew that Bowman Gilfillan were representing you and Transnet in the Gama litigation, you knew that?    Yes I knew that.    When you say in the Gama litigation – this matter?    Okay.    I am not sure if I knew that.    All I knew – yes.    Which has [00   Yes.    I am not sure if I knew that.    From Bowman Gilfillan.    No, no.    No I am on my own here.  There are two sort of matters.  If I recall Bowman Gilfillan are representing us on the Transnet Bargaining Council matter of Gama.    Yes they are.    Yes. ADV    Yes that is correct.    That is correct but do not forget that disciplinary hearing would have taken place maybe some six to eight months before.    And I was not there then and my – that is why engagement with them starts in January when this matter is being prepared.    For the Transnet Bargaining Council process.    I do not know – ja is it Mr Todd?    That is correct.    Yes I saw him yes.  He is a good attorney.    Yes.    That is correct.    No I did not.    I do not know.    When you say it is quite obvious?    I hear where you coming from yes.    Not really no.    My interpretation of Bowman Gilfillan – by the way I never saw their correspondence prior to – to maybe the beginning of January 2010.  So yes they would have been corresponding with my Group Legal but from where I sat I almost wanted a new pair of eyes to look into this matter as if getting to the Transnet Bargaining Council process.    Correct.    Hm.    Chairman that is the decision we took at the time and in my interpretation we needed almost a different set of eyes.  Ja.    I remain saying that we needed a different pair of eyes on this matter.    And yes Mr Gule or Deneys Reitz or whatever they are called ja.     I hear where you are coming from Mr Chairman.     That is correct, Chairman.     [Indistinct]      A different set of eyes, yes.     Is says that, yes.     Not really but yes I did want a different set of eyes to look into this matter.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Chair, you are heading in the right direction because even though the facts are not as clear as the time of these discussion but I think they do begin to indicate that maybe the sanction of dismissal who was inappropriate.   And I think that law firm, Deneys Reitz, does begin to indicate that there is risk of us losing this case if we take it to Transnet Bargaining Council.     Yes.     Page 108?     Yes.     I think he did Chair.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      No, Chairman maybe not but do not forget, the brief is different to what Bowman Gilfillan did.  The brief     It is a different set of eyes on this at the particular time.     No, Chairman.  That is how it comes across as well.  I agree with you.     Which?     Bundle 4.     Page 6, Bundle 4.  [poor connection – unclear]  Wait.  Six...      Thank you, Chairman.   INQUIRY ADJOURNS     H’m?  Page 6... [poor connection – unclear]  Yes?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Bundle 2.       380?     Yes.     yes.     Yes.     Yes.     A report, they had done a report by then.  But looking at what I am seeing here ...[intervenes]      It looks likes it was not on the 24t h of January.       Yes.     My understanding, besides this report there was another report on Transnet’s irregularities which is dated 2008 which I had at the time.     Yes.     No, no.  Ja, it is a long time ago, by the way, in terms of whatever we are talking about.  It is now nine years or so.     And I truly thought that this report here... by the way, I have never had this report.  I only saw it today.     I thought that this report from page 401 was actually published before the end of January.  Yes, I thought that.     Wait.  To the first ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chairperson.     I concede, yes.     Because I have never... I am seeing this for the first time.     But I was under... yes.  I was under the impression that there was a report towards the end of January 2011.  And besides, there was another report from Transnet Internal Audit which I had at the time which talked about the so-called 30 individuals who had done various things.  Ja, but even that, I do not have.     Yes.     No.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     Yes.     It is not correct, yes.     No, it is not there.  It was... it is called The Procurement Irregularities at TCP Procurement Irregularities at TFR, et cetera.  It is a report around the 08.  I still do not have that report.     I had the report.     I had the report then.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.  I agree with you.       Chairman, there was a report.  For some reason, it has disappeared, the one I am talking to.  Its title could have been Transnet... No.  Transnet Irregularities by Transnet Internal Audit done in two thousand - actually, two reports – done in 2008 and then there is another report. Now for whatever reason, those two reports are missing. And at the time, if you recall, there was this supply of a lot of information to my office by the organisation.  So I do recall having seen one or two of these reports.     My recollection, there was a report tabled to support certain statistics of allegations and condonements, et cetera, et cetera.     I hope somebody could just [poor connection – unclear] that report.       Ja, ja.     Chairman, you are correct.  If that report would not have compared... would not have listed this cases in comparison to Mr Gama.     Yes.     Five, one.     534...  Page 543?     Five, three, four...     534.  Okay.       One point six...     That is correct.     There was.  That is why I then... Also, I find it interesting that I get this minute today.  I have never had it.  That is why then, I am keen to get... what date was this thing?  [poor connection – unclear]   I am keen to actually get those reports by Transnet Group Internal Audit.  It was two reports.   And I do recall that I based my 30 cases or so, which were not identical to Gama’s because those cases never dealt with [poor connection – unclear], et cetera.  Those cases were dealing more with procurement issues.     Call it a... on paragraph 41.4, there was this document.     Procurement Irregularities at Transnet.  There was another document as well.  But it is this document that I thought the board have had sight of.  Where now I was talking to this list of 30 similar cases, if I could use the word.     But not hundred percent similar.     4.1.8.  Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.       Which meeting?     Yes.  What is its page?     Page 916?     Yes?     Yes.     It would be... first, I suspect the Corporate Governance. ADV MYBURGH     Correct.     Yes.     Paragraph?  What paragraph?     918?     Okay.     Yes, Chair?     Yes.     Yes.     It would have been the Corporate Governance to then come back to the board.     Yes.     Yes.     Bundle 3.  I do not have this, the previous minute.  Bundle 3?  [witness in conversation with another party]     Bundle 3, page 16?     16?     Oh, page 65.  Okay.  Keep the notes of that bundle of that meeting.  [witness in conversation with another party]  65, yes?     Yes, I think I did.  Ja.     Yes, I did.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes.     [poor connection – unclear] Yes.     Yes, I did.     Yes, it was.  It was.  It was, ja.     It is comprehensive.     Yes.     No, but then that did not stop me from getting a second opinion on it.     Which is why then I approached [poor connection – unclear]     I did Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     I read that paragraph as well.  Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     What page?     Can you help me with Bundle 1?  [witness in conversation with another party]  Okay.  Page 827?     [witness in conversation with another party]  Yes, I see this.     Yes.     That is correct.       That is correct.       That is correct.       Turn over the page.  [witness in conversation with another party]     It is 808.     Yes.     That is correct.       Yes.     That is correct.       That is correct.  Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I see that, Chair.     That is correct.       Bundle 2, yes.     Yes.  Bundle 2.  What page?     302...  [poor connection – unclear] 302.  302, yes.     Yes, I am there.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Three, zero, four?     Yes, I see Clause 2.     Yes.  Yes, I do.     Of the same, 293.  I have got this, yes.  293, yes.     I see it.     Yes, I am there but there is a problem with the system.  It keeps dropping.     Yes, I am there, I am on page – you said 297?     298.     I am there, yes.     I see it.     I see that.     Yes.     Yes, I do.     Okay, that is file …[intervenes]     File 1.     Yes.     Page 830.     There is a problem with sound.     Can you hear?     I cannot hear Advocate Myburgh.  I can hear the Chairman.     Advocate I can hear you.     Yes.  Yes, I am there.     Yes.     That is correct..     It does not at face value, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Because, Advocate, on the other side – no, I do concede that at face value it does not but there was this subcommittee which was debating this matter.     And that subcommittee then took a certain view that this person can be allowed to be interviewed.     That is correct.     No, I agree with you, Advocate.     I would disagree with that simplicity.     Because you put it as if because President Zuma at some stage had wanted him in that top position but this position at that current time, there was a head hunter who had been appointed to deal with the candidates who were keen to be considered for that position, so he would have competed with other candidates in terms of suitability.  Yes, from clause 4.8.4 I understand fully what you are saying.     We did deviate.     Chairman, I fully understand where you are coming from and yes, we did debate this clause 4.8.4 and yes, Mr Sharma was not supportive but yes, the other three board members, including myself, were supportive of Gama being interviewed.     Chairman, I would have followed the advice of Advocate [indistinct] 13.03.     No, we did ask for the advice and the time through debate and looking at various issues of debating that letter.  I was of the view that he must given that opportunity but do not forget it is now nine years later or ten years later and then I am asked the same question and I am saying hold it, I might have a different view.     I understand, Advocate, I understand.     854?  Okay, I have got that.     Yes.     Yes, I see that.     Yes.     I see that.     It looks like I said    Chairman, I do not remember.       I do not remember saying that but yes, this was taped.     I must have said so, ja.     Yes, I …[intervenes]     I knew what we were trying to settle.  The issue was he was – there was a contention on the sanction.  So we were dealing with the sanction.  So yes, I knew that.     Chairman, I do not recall why I could have said that, ja.     It is correct.     Ja, true.     I would agree with you, ja.     Do not forget, my saying fifty/fifty comes from a Deneys Reitz opinion which we had seen.  I am not sure of the time, ja.  I am not sure of the dates as well, ja.     Yes, he is.     I agree, Chairman.     Not really.     It sounds like a contradiction, Chairman, because although he does indicate that we have a good case, he then says let us rather postpone.  It sounds like a contradiction.     I agree with you, Chairperson.     I agree, ja.  It is a contradiction.     But that is not my statement, that is Siyabulela Mapoma’s…     He is being quoted, yes.     I understand where you are coming from.     I understand that.     I understand, Chairman.     You logic, Chairman, makes – logical.     Also, funny enough, I still do not understand what Mr Mapoma was saying with this sentence.     I fully do not understand.     No, I understand what you are saying.     Reinstate is a strong word.  Yes, I had been instructed to look into the fairness/unfairness.     Of particularly the sanction, yes.     It is.     Come again?  I am not sure what you want me to say.     No, I do not think so.     I agree with you, ja.     That is correct, Chairman.     That is correct.     No because still even if we had deviated from clause 4.8.4 there was a recruitment process where this individual would have competed against a lot of other individual.     I agree Chair.     Chair I cannot make you to be able to understand it, but your analysis is very good.     Yes fully Chair, I understand it and I agree with it.     Two, okay it must be that one.     Page 6?     Page 6, okay.     I see that.     That is correct.     I understand fully.     Thank you Chair.     Yes.     Yes I did.      That is correct.       That is correct Chair.     Chairman can you repeat, the sound was a little bit poor there.     There is a problem with sound.     I do not think he says that.     Page 13, okay I am there.      Well what page is that, Bundle 2 page 13?     4 at the bottom there?      Okay, yes I see it.  I see it, thank you.      That is correct.      He does not, yes.      No, I am not surprised yes.      That is correct.      Yes.      Yes, I agree.      That is correct.      That is correct.      No it does not, yes.      It creates doubt, yes.      That is correct.       That is correct.      Ja, no, no I am there and also do not forget it continues to indicate paragraph 12, 13 etcetera in terms of the need to come to something.        Not true.      That is correct.      It does not, yes.      No it does not, yes.     I accept that Chairperson.      Agree Chairperson.     I am aware of that.      Chairman as I indicated much earlier that one set of eyes with that was needed I tend to agree with you that this was a weak submission and I think we gave Mapoma that feedback as well and which is why then tried to augment it but even the augmented one Chairman it is a weak submission.     No.     No I could not fault it.     Chairman as I have indicated we needed a set of different eyes because true had we asked Mr Todd my interpretation is he had an opinion already and because we wanted a different set of eyes we then asked Deneys Reitz and yes it is not a detailed opinion but it created some doubt as to when we go to the Bargaining Council process of whether we will win or not, ja it did that.     Yes, I agree Chairperson.      I have accepted.      Agree Chairman.      The Board went with its opinion, yes.      And even their augmented opinion was still weak.      Chairman maybe not because as a new Board coming in you needed a different set of eyes on this issue particularly on the issue of sanction ja and that is all that the Board was looking at.     Chairman I agree with your analysis we did not take the two opinions and put them side by side and debate them side by side, we debated this one.       Yes, Chairman.     If I recall it would have served in the corporate governance committee.  ADV MYBURGH     There was a meeting on the - wait there is two meetings on the 16 t h, there was a meeting, a very short meeting it could have been a corporate governance just before the Board to consider this report.         On the 16 t h, that is correct.      That is correct.      Chairman I think I did or even at the corporate governance meeting just before the Board.       Yes, I would have to follow the audit trail.      Chairman it was on the advice of this opinion, yes.      That is correct, yes.      Yes, it was tabled I do not recall in what form but it was tabled.      I am not sure now I will have to ask Mr Mapoma myself or try and look at the audit trail of the documents.      It was tabled.      I am not sure in what form whether as a Deneys Reitz opinion or as an email from Mr Mapoma but it was tabled.       That is correct.      I would have presented it as advice through group legal but I was aware that it came through Deneys Reitz.       Yes, who had consulted Deneys Reitz.      That is correct.      No, no that is what was presented to the Board.      This is exactly what was presented to the Board, Mr Mapoma’s submission.      Chairman we appointed Deneys Reitz to look into certain aspects of the sanction in terms of the Transnet Bargaining Council processes and this is the opinion they came up with.  I had a consultation with them and this is the opinion they came up with and I used that opinion even at Board level.  I agree with you that the opinion compared to the opinion of Mr Todd is weak I fully agree with you and which is why then we requested that there must be a follow-up submission based on the same opinion which came in something that is dated 22 n d February 2011 but it is basically the same opinion.     It is trying to supplement what they had given to Mr Mapoma.      Yes I am on page 19.      That is correct.      After the Board meeting, yes.      That is correct.      It was not there, yes Chairman.      That is correct Chair.      Yes.      Paragraph…[intervene]    That is correct.  I must read that paragraph?     “There are various opinions which have been obtained from reputable firms of attorneys with regard to the prospects of success of Mr Gama in successfully challenging his dismissal by the company.  All the opinion including ours which we gave after perusing documents pertaining to the disciplinary inquiry were of the view that Mr Gama’s chances of successfully challenging his dismissal are not good.”    I have read.    I cannot fault it Chairman.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    But there is no improvement.  I agree.    I agree there is no improvement – it is the same.    There is.    That is correct.    That is correct Chairman.    I must think about that.    I think I am available Chairman yes.    Thank you Chairman. 
ADV MKHWANAZI: If I may good morning Chair, good morning Phillip.  Chair I would like to take the opportunity    Oh okay.  Chairperson.     Yes Chair [inaudible].

INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    All rise. 
MKWANAZI:  It was questioning the fairness or unfairness of the process.   I knew that Bowman Gilfillan are representing us in this Transnet Bargaining process.   But it would have listed similar irregularities, the quantum of the condonements, et cetera, et cetera.  It does not refer two reports, yes.  Without referring to Mr Gama.    I understand what you are saying Chairman. 
COUNSEL FOR MR MKWANAZI:   Excuse me Chair before ...[indistinct – audio faulty] five minute comfort break just to help ourselves.       Oh I see Chair apologies for that ...[indistinct] I was just asking for a five minute comfort break.     ...[Indistinct] five minute indulgence, a comfort break if possible.     five minute comfort break Chair yes please. 
MYBURGH SC:  And you know that they also represented you during the disciplinary hearing.  You would have even a little investigation would have shown that, correct?
