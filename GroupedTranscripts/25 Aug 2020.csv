CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning everybody.    Yes.      Yes.   I think your voice is soft or low.    That is much better ja.    Ja, ja.    Yes.  They sought – they had applied for Leave to Adduce Evidence in relation to the Transnet matters relating to the locomotives hey?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    No that is fine.  I see that they make their approach much earlier than I thought they had sometime – oh 28 July.  I think that – that is fine.  I grant them leave not to adduce evidence – oral evidence but the proviso that I would make is that that would not preclude the commission should the commission consider that there are aspects in respect of which it might wish to have oral evidence from one or more of – of their personnel toapproach them for that purpose.  Obviously to the extent that such people might be out of our jurisdiction that would be one thing but it may well be that their attitude might be that they would cooperate if the commission would like to question some of their personnel.  But for now, I grant the leave requested on that understanding.    Thank you.  And you are excused.    Thank you.     Hm.  Well somebody must just sanitise before Mr Hyde comes to the podium.  Good morning.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  So what wewill do then is we will adjourn the hearing of his evidence and I approve the arrangement you have made with Mr Notshe namely that by close of business on Friday this week he will furnish the commission with his statement or affidavit preferably an affidavit or affirm declaration and after that depending on the content of the affidavit or declaration then it may be necessary for him to come and give oral evidence.  So he is excused today on that understanding on the understanding that he will be notified as to the date when he should come back.   Thank you very much.    Well maybe you should first just give for the benefit of those who are watching or listening announce what todays’ evidence – to which work stream it relates and what it is about and its connection with other witness’ evidence.    You witnesses for today are Ms Dube, MrCoetzee, Ms S Thomas an F T Jotina is it not?    Okay.  The evidence that will be led today relates to BOSASA. Ms Dube will give evidence that will relate to allegations made by Mr Agrizzi in his evidence to the effect that certain items including grocery items were delivered to Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.  She will give evidence of what she knows about that.  The – Mr Jotina who was going to give evidence is said to have been a driver at BOSASA and according to Ms Dube he made some deliveries – he is not going to testify today.  His statement will be filed on Friday and arrangements will be made for him to testify in due course.  Mr F H Coetzee will be called today.  He is the owner of a certain guest house.  His evidence will relate to the evidence given by MrAgrizzi.  Mr Agrizzi testified that – or deposed to an affidavit and testified – or deposed to an affidavit that BOSASA organised and paid for the 50 t h birthday party for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane at the particular guest house and he said that he attended that party and he was coordinating arrangements for that party.  Since then the commission’s investigators have been able to speak to – or interview and obtain an affidavit from the owner of the guest house Mr Coetzee.  He will give evidence with regard to what party if any was held in that guest house relatingto Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.  The other witness is Ms S Thomas.  She used to be the PA to Ms Nomvula Mokonyane and she will give evidence with regard to what she may know about interactions between BOSASA and Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.  Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes okay alright.  Thank you.    Please administer the oath or affirmation.  Well if she – if she was served and we have a return of service then the police would have to be contacted.    For – to – to deal with non-compliance with a summons criminally.   Administer the oath and or affirmation.    Sorry just remove your mask a bit so that you can – we can hear you and then raise your voice a bit.  Okay start afresh.    Thank you.  You may be seated.    Ja well do not say Bundle 1 because I am sure there is Bundle 1 somewhere.  I think you – it is written here BOSASA Bundle 01.  That might just make it different from another bundle 1.    Ja.    So it is BOSASA Bundle.    Bundle 01 ja.   Okay alright.    Yes.    Are you looking at the red numbers?    Red numbers.    Please raise your voice Ms Dube so that what you say can be captured and recorded.   I am sorry why do you want her to read that?   Why do you want her to read that?    Oh okay.    Oh page 3 – paragraph 3?    Oh.    Oh if you ask her to tell me her duties, she will not need to read she knows what her duties were.    It is not a long list.    No Ms Dube will have to do something about your voice.  It is very low.    Ja and raise your voice.    Yes Mr Notshe she does not…    No she must not read – she can just tell us.  Tell the story.  She knows what she was doing. What were your duties at BOSASA when you were working at the head office?    Yes.    Yes. And who was in charge of thekitchen or that is not the – ja the kitchen?  Were you in charge of the kitchen?    Yes.  Okay.  Take it from there Mr Notshe.    What?    He was my senior.    What was Alistair ’s surname?    Huh?    Essau?    E-s-s-o?    Ja okay.    This side Ms Dube.    I am the one you are telling the story to.    Okay.  So I can hear you properly and you are looking that way and your voice is soft.  Yes okay.  Continue Mr Notshe.    I am not sure – I do not think she said she was not allowed to do deliveries.    Ja the arranging part I think this is what she was talking about.    Ja.  Is that correct?   Ja.  You say Ms Katherine Matabata was the one who was responsible for making arrangements for deliveries to Ms Mokonyane?    This was in respect of what?  The Christmas period?    And the first Christmas period that you were at BOSASA when – was which year?    Hm.    Hm.  Now were there other – were there other orders for people outside of BOSASA that had to be attended to during Christmas period other than Ms Nomvula Mokonyane?  Ja not for individuals.Not forindividuals?    Not for individuals?  It was only for organisations and institutions.    How – how were orders treated?  Were they labelled and given names or the people working in the kitchen always knew that this order is for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane, this one is for Baragwaneth, this one is for another institution?    They were not labelled?    Ja.    Ja okay.  Continue Mr Notshe.    Well let us deal with it this way.  Did you ever see the order for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane?    You never saw it?    You only heard about it and from whom did you hear about it?   Who are Food Boys?    Is that what it was called?  Is that what the company was called Food Boys?    Oh that is the name of the company?    What were – what was – what – werethey providing meat to BOSASA or what was the…    What were they doing?    So part of your job was to order meat from Food Boys – part of your job?    Was to order meat from the Food Boys?    Yes.    But Food Boys only provided meat or they also provided other things – other items?    Oh so your duties included ordering whatever the kitchen needed?    Including meat?  Do you order meat only from Food Boys or did you also order it from some other place?    Yes.  So just go back to how you came tohear about an order for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane.  Just tell me the story as it happened.    H’m?    Okay I am sorry.      Okay.  Did you call the Food Boys for some reason and then they told about this order?    They called you?    Since you are?    Oh, was closed?    For the Christmas break?    Yes.   They said there is a big order?    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    So you did not ask whose order it was?    Yes.    Yes.    But then they told you   Okay.    H’m?    Ja.  H’m.    So the Food Boys are not the ones whotold you that the order was for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane?    They told you there was a big order ...[intervenes]     And they wanted to find out what should be done with it because the office was closed?    And then you phoned Ms Mathabathe and    Okay.  And... okay take it from there.    Look this side Ms Dube.    Okay, let us... the evidence you gave earlier on when you say the Food Boys called you, which year was that?    It was 2017?   Okay.  And after Ms Mathabathe had    H’m?    Why do you say obviously?    But you do not know that, is it?  Do you know that?    You do not know that?   You just assume it was delivered?    Is that correct?    Okay.  But you never had anything to do with it after Ms Mathabathe had spoken to you?    And you did not see it... you did not see the actual parcel?  You did not see anybody delivering it?  Isthat right?    Okay.  Do you have any understanding as to who would normally make deliveries to people of orders for meat and other things?    H’m?    Ja.  Were there a number of drivers?    Sorry?    Was the only one driver?    Who was working for?    For head office?    There was only one?    For head office?   That Mr Jotina?    Okay alright.      H’m.    Ja, do not move.      Ja, sit still.  Ja.  Sit still.  Okay Mr Notshe.  You say that was during election campaigns?    Okay.      Do you know how... what the monetaryvalue was of the order for Ms Nomvula Mokonyane that the Food Boys called you about?  Or the price, do you know what it was or do you not know?    That is what they said    Ja.  So it was they said.  You do not know about it but that is what they told you?    Ja.  Okay alright.  The Food Boys, when you left BOSASA was that company still there or you do not know?    Do you know if it is still there now?   Do you know or you do not know?    When last did you...?    Yes.    Ja, in 2019, were they still there?  Do you know?   Are you sure?    Yes.  Okay alright.  Thank you.  Thank you for coming to give evidence.  You are excused.      You may go.    [No audible reply]     Let him get seated first.  Let them finish what they are doing.     Yes, Mr Notshe.    Did she go that far?    To say, no birthday party was held at the Victorian Guest House for her?    You clarified that?    Okay.    Ja, okay.   H’m?    Yes, yes.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.  Just press it so that... ja.    Thank you.  You may be seated Mr Coetzee.    Mr Notshe, you forgot to ask me to admit Mr Bongiwe Dube’s statement as an exhibit.    What exhibit?    Ms Bongiwe Dube’s affidavit is admitted and will be marked EXHIBIT T25. AFFIDAVIT OF MS BONGIWE DUBE IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT T25    Ja.    [No audible reply]     Well, maybe before that.  Maybe Mr Coetzee can just tell me how it came about because from reading his affidavit, I think he has a fair recollection of how it came about.  How did it come about that you hosted Ms Mokonyane’s 40t h birthday party?    Yes.    And who did he say the function was going to be for?    So at that time she was MEC for Safety and Security in Gauteng?    Yes.  So and... and so Mr Agrizzi was the one who called you and he said they were looking to do a function for... a birthday function for Ms Mokonyane?    And that they will be responsible as BOSASA for paying ...[intervenes]     ...for that function.   Yes.  At that stage, did he tell you how many guests they were looking at having?    For 80.  Eight zero?    Yes.    Ja.   Yes.  So it started being a function that was meant for 80 people?    And then the numbers went up to 120?    But on the day of the function the numbers went up to 174?    Yes.  Do you remember the date when the function was held?  Or you can look in your affidavit.    I think your...    Ja.    Yes.    Was the invoice on page 6?   I am sorry.  We are looking... are we looking at the invoice on page 6?    Okay under tab 26.  Mr Notshe, are you... should we not be using the black numbers?    No, I think you... I think you may have forgotten.  You see, if you use the... if you use these red numbers, are you not going to run into... yes, you will run into the problem that... under different tags you start afresh.  I think the... it is  black numbers that are used because they start from page 1 and go up to the last page.  I think we should use the black numbers.   So the invoice we are talking about appears at page 14 if you look at the top left corner, the black numbers.    So it says And then it    Would that then be the date when the event was held?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay continue Mr Notshe.  But I would like him to just tell me ...[intervenes]   ...how everything unfolded as he remembers it.    Mr Coetzee, I do not know.  It is like everybody... every witness today, their voices are very soft.   Please try and raise your voice and do not be too far from the mic.    Yes, okay.  Just repeat what you said just before I interrupted you.    H’m, h’m, h’m.   H’m.    Yes, yes.    Okay.    That was a long time ago.    Close to... it is about what?  Eighteen years.    It is about eighteen years now.  How is that you seem to remember this function so well?    H’m, h’m.  In terms of the profile of the function, was it quite usual for your guest house to host functions of that profile at that time?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  So why you and your mom may have been involved in high-profile functions, this was the first high-profile function for this guest house.    Ja, okay.  Okay alright.  Thank you.  Andare you able to say Ms Mokonyane was there at the function?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  And was Mr Agrizzi at the function as well?    Yes.  Are there any other persons of high-profile that you can remember that were also there or not really?    Yes, okay.   Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.     Okay.  Mr Notshe    I am sorry, would you ask him to just read those items?     Yes?     For the 80 people then obviously subsequent to the numbers increasing so drastically, the final invoice was submitted.     So the invoice, you had to add R16 757.50?     As a result of the …[intervenes]     The increasing numbers.      Okay, so the total function cost you – cost how much?   That is R25 080 plus R16 757,50, is that right?       It is adding the two, they have not been added here or are they added somewhere else?     Ja.  Okay, well that would be 35, 40 – it looks like 41 000 something.     Ja.  I think it would be 41 000 and some change.      Okay, alright.  So that was more or less what you charged for doing that function for MsMokanyane’s 40 t h birthday party in 2003.     Okay.     So the liquor that had been provided byBOSASA is not included here obviously because …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     So you …[intervenes]     So if one includes that, then BOSASA must have paid quite a substantial amount, much more substantially than 41 000.     What – well, you deal with function regularly.     Are you able to give an estimate of what the function must have cost BOSASA when you include the liquor?  Obviously, you do not have an itemised bill relating to liquor but you saw how much it was, you say it was – it took quite a substantial part of your garage.     About how much?     Yes.     So your estimate would be?     Just for the liquor?     Ja, so if you add what you charged that could come to about R80 000 or thereabout.    Okay, alright.     You said exhibit, you mean pages 16 and 17?     Ja, what is on page 16 there, MrCoetzee?     Yes. MR     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  And then, of course, page 18 is also – does it also reflect what was on a certain table, I guess the décor and the glasses and the cutlery.     Yes.  Yes, Mr Notshe.     I am sorry, what is it, page 20?     Yes, ja.     I am sorry, let us take it one at a time. What invoices are these?     And the one at page 20, the total is R1 860.10, is that right?     And it is written exactly what wine youbought.     Ja.  And then page 22, what invoice is that?  From whom to whom?     Ja.     And the amount is R1 320?    Yes.     Ja.     Yes.  Okay and 23?       That is 23 and 24?     Okay, that is for, among others, the furniture, tables and other things that you needed for the function, is that right?     23 and 24, that is for the furniture,tables as well as other items that you needed for the function.     Yes, table cloths and black napkins that appears at page 24.  At page 23, what is the total that appears on the invoice?     I see R615,96.  Are we on the same page?     Page 23, black 23.     I have 615,96, is that right?     Okay.     Oh, when you add them together that is how you come to 8, ja.  Okay.  Yes, Mr Notshe.     T...?     Mr Frederick Henry Coetzee’s affidavit isadmitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT T26. FREDERICK HENRY COETZEE’S AFFIDAVIT HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT T26     Now how long did the function take, do you remember?     In the morning?     Yes.  And this was the only functionrelating to Ms Mokonyane’s birthday party that you hosted.     Okay.  Yes.  No, thank you very much …[intervenes]     Yes, okay.     Do you remember if there was a theme for the party?     Ja.  I see that there is no where written Ms Nomvula Mokonyane on the invoices, that must bebecause she was not going to pay.     Because BOSASA was going to pay.  That is why you have got BOSASA and Mr Agrizzi’s name on the invoices.     Ja.  Okay, but you are quite clear that this function was for Ms Mokonyane’s 40 t h birthday party.     You are not mistaken about that.    And BOSASA paid.     Yes.  Thank you very much, Mr Coetzee, for coming to assist the Commission, we appreciate it very much.  Thank you very much, you are excused.     Thank you.  Has she made contact with the Commission at all or through herself or through attorneys.     Not all since the summons was served?     Ja?     Ja.     Ja. ADV NOTSHE     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Okay, how long ago was it when they called you?     Ja.     Well, I am going to adjourn, I suggest that contact be made with them or Ms Thomas if there is contact but certainly with the attorneys to say …[intervenes]     To say she is not here and they are not here, what is going on, simply because that firm seems to cooperate with the Commission quite well when Ms Mokonyane was going to give evidence, if I recall correctly.     Just in case there is something.     I think I will adjourn and then when I come back you can then tell me what is going on.     So we will adjourn for twenty minutes just to give you a little of more time.     So we will resume at twenty to twelve.     Then you can give me a report of what is going on.    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay.  I think we are going to adjourn.  I think you must inform him.  I will adjourn until two.       Let him be here at two but with thewitness.     Because the witness was served with a summons to be here and if he is going to apply for a postponement that application must happen at a time when the witness is in compliance with the summons.     And that means being here even if she was supposed to be at nine and she was not here but I have difficulty with the idea where a summons has beenissued and served that you can apply for a postponement with a client or witness not being there unless it is a situation where the witness is sick, then that is different but – so I think if the witness is not here at two, when he is here, then I will have to hear what the good reason is why the witness is not here.     Ja and then if he has an application to move then we will deal with it then but if the application is moved in circumstances where the witness continues to be in breach of the summons, that might pose difficulties for the application.     So we will adjourn until two o’clock.     Good afternoon Mr Madlanga.     Just pull the mic closer to you so I canhear you, ja, I think.     Can I see a copy of the letter, have you got a copy?  Well the first point is, the summons required Ms Thomas to be here this morning, isn’t it?     I think at 9 o’clock, is that right?    And she was not excused from being here at 9 o’clock, isn’t it?     So, she should have been here, isn’t it?     And irrespective of what application was to be made, if someone says you must be at Court or at the Commission on a certain date and time, until you are excused you have an obligation to be there at that time.  If you are going to ask for a postponement of the hearing of your evidence, you make it while you are there, while you are in compliance with the summons, you don’t sit at home and when the summons says you must be at theCommission.  If your lawyers are going to apply, they apply while you are there because the application might be refused and what is supposed to happen if you are not there, you understand? MR     Yes, ja I think bring the mic closer because I’m also struggling to hear you, do you want to just repeat what you said?     But I see from this letter that there have been 11 days, she seems to have been served with summons 11 days ago on the 14 t h of August, according tothis letter.     Yes well she might not have acted promptly which she should have done, you know, that appears to me to be enough time to have consulted with the lawyers and be ready and of course, as I understand the summons, and I’m speaking under correction, as I understand the summons it didn’t require her to put up an affidavit, it required her to present herself and she wouldbe questioned or have I missed something in the summons?     You see…[intervenes].     My understanding from the legal team is that previous attempts that have been made to obtain an affidavit from your client by the Commission have not been successful, she has not been very cooperative, that’s the impression I have, from what I’ve been told.  That is why a summons was issued, to say, she needs to come here and be questioned because she didn’t seem to be cooperatingin terms of filing any affidavits, that’s the impression I have from the reports that I’ve been given and now if you say, as you do, in this letter that you have been representing her and interacting with the Commission, it may well be that you know about that as well.     But you see, my understanding, as I say, is that the Commission’s legal team and investigation team have long been trying to get an affidavit from her and that has not been forthcoming and that is why it was resorted to issuing a summons and getting her to come here to say, even without an affidavit she will be questioned because the Commission doesn’t have time we are running out of time, we can’t be postponing and postponing.  If she had provided an affidavit much earlier, maybe it would have been clear there was no need for her to come and give evidence or she would long have appeared before the Commission giving her evidence, that’s the impression I’ve received as to why, up to now, the Commission doesn’t have any affidavit from her and then a summons has beenissued then she’s not here in the morning.  This morning we – a summons had been issued more or less at the same time against one of the BOSASA drivers and his lawyer was here and I’m told he was here too because he understood that, if a summons says you must be at the Commission at such and such a date at such and such a time, you must be there.  They were here, they made arrangements because it transpired that he needed Sesotho interpreter and those arrangements had not been made because it was not known that he would need an interpreter and arrangementswere made but they were here, the lawyer was here and I’m told the client was – the witness was here to comply with the summons you see.  So, it’s unacceptable, when somebody receives a summons and without having been excused first, stays away.  If it’s a situation where somebody is in hospital, that’s different but then somebody must appear and say, this is the situation but you can’t just stay away just because the lawyers will apply for a postponement because who said the postponement will be granted, do you understand?     Now, with regard to there being an affidavit do you say there’s an affidavit of Ms Gina or Gina or somebody?    That has been served on her?    How long ago was it served on her, do you know, together with summons or what?     You can take instructions.     Hm.     Ja, how long is it do you know?  I take it, it must be short?     How many pages is it?     Ja that’s quite short.     You know, I might postpone because of that affidavit otherwise I would have wanted her to take witness stand and give evidence because she would be asked about things that she knows and there’s been a lot of time, from what I’ve been told, when attempts were made to obtain an affidavit from her but now if I postpone the hearing of her evidence I would postpone it to eitherMonday or Tuesday next week because from then on, I mean next week Monday we’re supposed to have a certain matter, certain witness, that witness, other arrangements have to be made, so there’s a space there, Tuesday, I think there may be – I think it’s Ms Gina or I’m not sure who is the 1 s t of September after that we have witnesses lined up for quite some time so it makes it very difficult when there has to be a postponement.  So, of course, in this kind of situation a client must get lawyers who are available when the client is required to appear because otherwise if weare only going to wait for her lawyers who might not be available we are not going to get anywhere.  So, if I postpone, I’m looking at early next week and from what I’ve heard from other witnesses, I don’t expect that her evidence will be too long, so that’s why I’m saying, if she received the summons on the 14 t h there’s been enough time to prepare her affidavit but from the Commission’s side even if she didn’t prepare an affidavit, if she presented herself, she’ll be questioned and would get on with the job.  So, if I postpone you might have to see what arrangements you make but it would either be – it seems to me it would either be Monday or Tuesday.     Ja, let me hear what Mr Notshe has to say and then we’ll take it from there.    Sorry?     But today there was going to be no statement and we would proceed, isn’t it?     Yes.    Well today is what, Tuesday?     Ja, well if they’re going to file an affidavit it might have to be this week.     Have you got a witness for Tuesday?     On Wednesday?     Ja, there might be some other witnessbut even if there is, her evidence is not supposed to be too long as far as I’m concerned.     Okay, alright, Mr Madlanga what do you say to …[intervenes].     You can file on Friday.     Ja, okay, Ms Thomas it’s not good thatyou are not here at 9 o’clock, it’s not acceptable.  If a summons says you must be in Court or in the Commission on a certain date at a certain time, unless you are sick, you are in hospital, you must be there.  If you are going to ask that there be an adjournment, a postponement you must first comply with the summons because when you don’t comply with the summons, that’s a criminal offence, you understand?     Ja, so the sheriff is supposed to have explained to you, so I’m going to grant your lawyer ’s request for a postponement.     But then on that day that I’m going togive you, you must be here.     Ja, I don’t think your evidence will be too long so even the preparation should take too long.     Ja okay, alright.  I think what we’ll do then, Mr Madlanga,  one, I will postpone to – the hearing of her evidence to Monday and on the – and you must file her statement or affidavit by close of business on Friday this week and I will make this – her appearance to be in termsof Regulation 10(6) of the Regulations of the Commission.  Failure to comply with such a directive is a criminal offence, Ms Thomas.  So, the hearing of Ms Thomas’ evidence is postponed to Monday next week at 10 o’clock and in terms of Regulation of 10(6) of the Regulations of the Commission I direct that she must appear in this venue at 10 o’clock on Monday next week.  Through her lawyers she must file her affidavit or affirmed declaration with the Commission by close of business on Friday this week, alright, okay.     You are excused for today but come back on Monday as I indicated otherwise you will be – you’ll run the risk of facing criminal charges.   We adjourn.
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson.    Chairperson the purpose of todays’ sitting at least originally in relation to CRRC was to hear evidence from them pursuant to you having granted their Rule 3.4 application.    There has since been…    I will speak up.    Thank you.      There has since been an exchange of correspondence between the commission and CRRC.  I will take you through that if necessary.  But it has culminated that correspondence in CRRC confirming yesterday thatthey are not in a position to attend the proceedings today but that in any event they do not intend to adduce oral evidence and that they will stand by the statement that they submitted in support of their Rule 3.3.6 and 3.4 Application.Perhaps I could just hand up the correspondence to you?    That is correct Chairperson.    You will see that I have flagged with a yellow flag where the correspondence starts.    Initially on the 28 July they advisedthat because of the Covid-19 pandemic their senior people would not be able to travel from China.    And then they went on in paragraph 4 to say they want to avail themselves of their rights in terms of Rule 3.9 to apply for leave to make legal submissions.    And they said they would do that before the 25 August.  If you go to the next letter on the 7 August, they then reaffirm their position.   And what then happened on the 18 August the Chairperson you will see the next letter this essentially purports to be a set of Rule 3.9 submissions.    In support of the statement and annexures that had already been filed.    You will see if you go to the next letter that yesterday the – under the hand of the Acting Secretary of the commission.    They were advised that they would still be required to appear today.    And they would be required  1. To place on record that they no longer intend to adduce oral evidence at the commission pursuant to their Rule 3.3.6 read with 3.4 application granted on the 25 March and 2. That they would seek leave from you Chairperson to no longer adduce oral evidence.    That then takes us to the last letter that we received in response where they record inparagraph 1 at the end that they no longer wish to adduce oral evidence at the commission.  At paragraph 2 they say that they not in a position to arrange a legal representation today at short notice.  But it is really paragraphing 3, 4 and 5 Chairperson that are important and I will read them into the record.    Paragraph 3   Thank you Chairperson.    Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson we were scheduled to hear evidence of four witnesses.  The witnesses are coming under a subpoena and one of the witness’ is Mr Fuzile Thomas Jotina.  He is represented by Mr Kevin Hyde and Mr Kevin Hyde would like to make some presentations and bring some – something to the attention of the commission.  Mr Hyde is here too.    Chair the next witness to testify is Ms Bongiwe Eves Dube and Ms Dube gave her statement and she is here.    Yes.  Chair the evidence today is the evidence of – relating to BOSASA – BOSASA activities.  And the evidence of Mr Agrizzi was to the effect that BOSASA gave some presents in the form of meat, drinks and – to one of the people Ms Mokonyane and otherpeople.  And one of the people who were involved in the BOSASA who was responsible to arrange that was Ms Dube.  And Ms Dube was arranging those deliveries and you have just heard the evidence of a witness Mr Jotina who was – who has been excused from testifying. Mr Jotina is one of the drivers that Ms Dube says he did deliveries.  So the evidence of Ms Dube is in relation to the deliveries that were made by BOSASA to people including Ms Mokonyane.    Yes Chair yes.    Chair may I just indicate even at this early stage that Ms – we have not seen Ms Sandy Thomas yet.    So though there is a return of service.    And that she was served but we will deal with that.    When we come to the    To that stage of the proceedings.    Ms Bongiwe Eves Dube’s testify.    Yes the …    Yes Judge the – Chairperson the – when the turn comes for her to testify and she is still not here and then I will ask the Chair to – to authorise that a charge be laid against her with the police.    Chair I understand from the – from the people who are looking after the records that as per your directions there is new bundle that has been compiled andit is Bundle 1 and all the evidence of the witness – all the statements of the witnesses who are testifying today would be under that bundle although they will be under separate exhibit numbers.  So the evidence of – the statement of Ms Dube will be in Bundle 1 but Exhibit T25.    I understand.    So it is BOSASA.    It is BOSASA Bundle 01    Yes.    And then the evidence – the statement of Ms Bongiwe Dube is Exhibit T25 in that bundle.    Ms Dube can you have a bundle in front of you?    Can you look at – what is – on page 1 which is after the cover sheet index Exhibit T25 there iswhat is written page 1.  You see that?    Yes.    And if you – I beg your pardon.    Yes.  Are you looking at – look at the red numbers Ms Dube am I right?    Yes.  Now Ms Dube look at the – that statement and go to page 4 of that statement the red 4.      There are – just above…    What you can do Ms Dube is to lower the microphone towards you.    Ms Dube there is on page 4 there is above the word signed there is initials BED – B E Dube, is that your signature?    Ms Dube do you confirm that this statement is your statement?    And you swore – you took an oath to it?    Yes.  Now Ms Dube do you confirm that you previously worked at BOSASA?    And what was your position?    When did you join BOSASA?    Now what were your duties?    So just to [00   Now on paragraph 4 on page 1 of the statement you deal with what you were doing in BOSASA.  Can you read that for the record?    Page – page 4.  No page 1 paragraph 4 at the bottom of page 1.      I beg your pardon?    It is just the duties of what she was doing?    Yes.    Paragraph 4.    Yes.    Yes that is fine.   Yes.    Come closer Ms Dube.    And then you all over the page.    Who were your seniors on top?    Who were your seniors above you?    Who were they?    Yes.    And who else?    Tell me who was before you in your position?    I see.  Now with the issue of delivery of food who instructed you – who gave you instructions as to what should be delivered and where?    Is there any other person besides him?    In your –     Now you in your statement you also mention Papa Leshabane what was he?    Where at BOSASA?    Did he also give you instructions for the deliveries?    Now you also in your statement dealwith the – the deliveries over Christmas time in December.    Can you tell the commission about that?    Yes.    What did you do in respect of her?   I see.    And you were saying you were not allowed to deliver – did deliveries regarding Ms Nomvula Mokonyane. Who did not allow you to do that?   To arrange.  She said I was not allowed to arrange deliveries.    Yes.    Now just going back to the delivery.  The incident in 2016 when you say you were phoned by the Food Boys and you were closed.  Did you call Ms Matabata about the – the order that you – you were asked about but the Food Boys?   I see.  And then in the – in your statement you also say there was a large order of meat and then you give an estimation.  How did you arrive at the estimation of the amount?    Chair, can I...?    Can we come and just clarify before we get there?     You say the Food Boys said there is a big order there for Catherine, alright?     And then you phoned Catherine to ask    Just hold on.     Yes.  Just... just.     And then you... you then say Ms Mathabathe said you should not worry about it.  She will deal with it.     Now in your statement you say the same occurred the following year in December 2017.  What... when you say that what do you mean?  You say the same occurred in 2017.  What occurred in December 2017?     Yes.     Sorry, Chair.  Can I just ask...?     Ms Dube, just settled.  Do not move up and down.     Your voice is moving up and down.     Now when did you start at the head office?     2013.  And then when did you startdealing with all the Food Boys?     In 2013?     I see.  Now after the incident wherein the Food Boys called you about the large parcel, did you ever call you again?     I see.  So the only incident that they call you was that one incident when they said there was a large order.     And it is for Ms Catherine.     Now did you... were you ever involved in other issues like birthdays of people?     Who gave you instructions to do that?     What did you do as the stuff for that birthday?     I see.  Now in your statement, you also deal with the politicians who attended the BOSASA Head Office.     And did you delivering... what did you cater for them?     Can you remember which politicians you saw?     And then you also mention in your statement the destruction of documents.  What were... whatwere the documents that were destroyed?     I see.  And then lastly, you say in your statement that you were in the end dismissed by BOSASA.     So this is the evidence of the witness.     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, the next witness is Mr Frederick Hendrick Coetzee.     Chair, is... as you... as we have indicated in the opening address indeed that Mr Coetzee is the owner of the guesthouse.     [No audible reply]      Mr Coetzee, Chair is the owner of the Victorian Guest House and Chair will remember that there was the evidence of Mr Agrizzi that there was a party, a birthday party held at the Victorian Guest House for the 50t h birthday of Ms Mokonyane.  And Chair will remember that Ms Mokonyane testified the fact that no birthday party was ever had at that guesthouse, neither her 40t h or her 50t h or any other birthdayparty was held at that place.And now Chair the statement has been obtained from Mr Coetzee ...[intervenes]      Yes, she went that far Chair.     Yes, she went that far.  We clarified that.     We clarified that.       That it is no 40 t h no 50t h and no birthday party.     Yes.     Mr Coetzee is here to testify.     Now Mr Coetzee, can you... there is a bundle in front of you.     It is written BOSASA Bundle 1.    Can I ask you to turn to Exhibit 26?  You will see there is a tag 26 and then below that, you will see underneath that there is Exhibit T26.     It is written Mr Frederick Hendrick Coetzee.     Yes, Chair.  I beg your pardon.  May itbe permitted as Exhibit T25?     T25 Chair.     In BOSASA Bundle 1.     Thank you, Chair.     And then there is also a signature there.  Is that your signature?     And then that affidavit is accompanied by a number of annexures.  The last annexures is at page 16.    You go to this.  Do you confirm that this affidavit is your affidavit?     Together with annexures?     Mr Coetzee, can you just tell the Court the... your history as the owner of the Victorian Guest House?  When did you become the owner?     Can you confirm the address of the... isthe name, is it Victoria Guest House.     Can you confirm the address?     Yes.  Now there is evidence of Mr Agrizzi that he coordinated a birthday party, the 50t h birthday party “Break the Leg” at the Victoria Guest House situated at that address.     Do you remember a birthday party coordinated by Mr Agrizzi.     I see.  Now, and what did the...  was the... who paid for the birthday party?     There is an invoice on page 6.  Will thathelp Mr Coetzee?     I see on the invoice is written “attention”.  Attention for Angelo Agrizzi for even and then ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     No, we are using the red numbers Chair.     No, that is fine Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Now you have just told the Chair that the even for was 80 people and then it increased to 120 people.  How did you manage to then cater for this increased numbers?     Now the... can you just tell the Commission about the arrangement?  Who provided food and who provided the drinks?     In paragraph 14 on page 10 you deal with... you mention there a liquor store which sponsored this.  Can you explain that to the Commission?     H’m.     Now how much liquor?  Do you know?  Can you estimate?  Where did you have to put the liquor?     Now what type of liquor was this?  Canyou remember?    After you had been contacted by the investigators of the Commission did you go to archives to look for documents, invoices relating to this?    Can you turn to page 14, the black 14, that is an invoice.    Is this the invoice for the event?    And we see the invoice is invoice to BOSASA, it is from Victoria Guesthouse to BOSASA.    And it is for attention of Mr Agrizzi.    And then it lists the items that would bepaid for.    Now in …(intervenes)    He can go to those items that were invoiced for.    Yes please.    And then there is also a thank you payment for R25 080.      What was that?     So this 16 was for the people you saidwere not catered for in the beginning?    I see.    And then there was also a garage full of liquor.    That had been obtained from the – in this bottle store.    and you have also attached to your affidavit exhibit – page 16 and 17.  There seems to be some fancy …[intervenes]    I beg your pardon, pages 16 and 17, the black 16 and 17.    And then on page 20 to 24, this looks like the invoices that were invoiced to you for what you had supplied, is that correct?    From page 20 to 24, Chair, the invoices that were issued to the guesthouse.    Look on page, Mr…   Chair, that is the evidence of Mr Coetzee.  Can that be – the affidavit can then be admitted as EXHIBIT T26 together with the annexures that...    T26, EXHIBIT T26.    Just one question to the witness?    Mr Agrizzi said the party was supposed to be Break a Leg, did anyone break a leg?    Thank you, Chair.    The next witness who is supposed is Ms Sandy Thomas and I have not seen her, I have not been contacted by her and, Chair, her – the summons calling her to testify appears in EXHIBIT T27 and can I take you,Chair, to page 57 of this bundle where we have return of serve in respect thereof in that she was …[intervenes]    No, not – I have not received anything.    What I – I had received a call from the attorneys, Madlanga Attorneys.    To say they will represent her as well.   And they indicated that they might ask for time but I had said then that if they want to do that, one, they must write to the Commission.    But I told them that my view is that they will have to appear.    She will have to appear and then apply here for a postponement or for whatever.    As Mr [indistinct] 14.16 did.   When he appeared and then applied for a postponement.    And I have heard nothing from that end, I have not seen any correspondence.    It was last week, I think about Thursday.   Ja.    No, I will definitely call the attorneys.  Unfortunately, I have …[intervenes]    Yes.    Yes.   I will do that.    Thank you.    Thank you, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.    The witness, Ms Thomas, Mr Madlanga, he informs that he had briefed counsel to appear but I told him that no one appeared and he is on his way to the Commission and he indicated that he is going to apply for a postponement of the evidence of the witness.  And he said he estimates that he will be here at about ten past twelve.    That is fine.    No, that is fine.    I understand.    I understand.    No, that is fine.    Thank you, Chair.INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Chair if Monday is – Tuesday will be even better but then if we’re going to prepare a statement, we’d like to have a statement for Monday…[intervenes].

WITNESS:   Frederick Hendrick Coetzee.     No, I do not.    Yes, I do.     So help me God. 
FREDERICK HENDRICK COETZEE:  (d.s.s.) 
MR COETZEE:   Ja?     Yes?     Yes?     Yes?     Yes, it is.     Yes.     It is mine.     It is mine indeed, yes.     I have been involved with the guest house since 2000... early 2000 as co-owner with my mother which unfortunately and subsequently passed away in November 2018.  Since then I have been the sole owner up to currently.     It is Victoria Guest House.     It is A1 Tom Muller Street, West village, Krugersdorp.       H’m.    I do but not the original as I was initially enquired about.  Ms Mokonyane had a 40t h in 2003 and which was arranged by Mr Agrizzi himself and my... between Mr Agrizzi and myself.     BOSASA as one of or was one of my corporate lines and have been so for many years.  We arejust down the road from one another.     Up until that point, they have used my guest house as venue.  I then got a call from Mr Agrizzi himself asking me, you know, for a quick meeting.  He and somebody else from BOSASA, which I cannot recall her name, then came to the guest house itself enquiring to do this function.Also informing me who the function would be for, as well as, Chair to answer your questions that BOSASA will be paying for the entire event.    It was for the then Minister Safety and Security, Nomvula Mokonyane.     Yes.     Yes.     For the account, ja.     Yes.     Initially it was for 80.     Eight zero.     Which then subsequently went up to 120.  That was the final confirmed number for the event.     At the day of the event when the guests started arriving that exponentially grew to 174.     Yes.     Yes.     174.  That is correct, ja.     I think it was the end of June 2003.     Just quickly...  That was when the invoice was originally submitted for the 80 guests.     The final one was submitted only later.     The 28t h of June.  Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    Being when it was actually held itself, ja.     The event took place.     Normally as a venue when we do events youcater for 10, 15 people extra.  Luckily for us for that evening their speeches were quite long which then... we and the kitchen managed to get enough food.  We changed the menu slightly to accommodate everybody.  And as I said, luckily for the speeches being so long, we managed to actually produced food for all the people attending the event.     This was part of the agreement in our initialcontract with Mr Agrizzi that BOSASA would be bringing in all the beverages.  Let me rephrase.  Not all the beverages, the majority of the beverages.  We will do arrival drinks, wine and sparkling wine for the speeches.  The rest was all brought in and sponsored by BOSASA.     How I know which store it was.  The next day whatever was left over a few crates of mixes, like we call it in our industry, I personally delivered it back to this liquor store ...[intervenes]      Sorry, sorry.     Okay.     I personally... whatever was left over from the event, the next morning I personally took back to the liquor store.  It was I think two or three crates of mixes.     Initially when it was delivered, it was quite a substantial amount of boxes which is unusual for the size of the event as well.     Ja.     It was delivered actually in one of my garages which was one side.  I had to remove a car.  It was, as I said, it was quite a substantial amount of alcohol delivered.     Yes.     It was also the upper range of brandies, KWV, Johnny Walker Blacks and Reds.  It was the normal malt whiskeys or anything like that but it was the upper range of each brand.     Yes.     Yes.    Chair, there is... in our industry you can almost speak to anybody that has been in it for a long time.  There are certain events that do just stuck in your head of which this event is one of them.  One, because we had to scramble behind doors to get extra food done and to get extra seating done.  The procedure of event.  Although, I personally and the guest house has catered for truly grateful(?) people, it is sometimes just small things that just gets stuck in your head.  And when the day I did my affidavit, you know collected     Not for us personally.     I have done quite a number of events personally.     I have done quite high profile celebrates,both local and international, as well as, for my mother.     For the guest house itself, that was the first high-profile event we did for the government.     But I had a prior and post that event ...[intervenes]      ...I have done quite a significant number of high-profile events for people, yes.     For Victoria Guest House itself, ja.     I was personally introduced to her.     I ran the function function-wise.     The event went on for quite a while that evening as well.     Of which, at a certain point, I sent all thestaff home.     So, ja I was there up until the last guest left.     And as I said, during the course of the evening, I was introduced to her personally as well.     Yes, they were.  He was there as well, ja.     Exactly name-wise, I cannot.     But I can you there were.     As that is the reason why the speeches went on for three and a half hours.     A few minutes made some speeches.     Other than just a normal raise the glass and go.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, it is.     Yes it is.     Ja.     Yes, it is.     And read it?     It was for 174 people for catering, flowers,some venue hire – because of the function going on quite late that evening, for chair covers hired in for the event, setting layout, pre-drinks prior to the event, wine, both red and white for the event, J C Le Roux for the speeches and then a bar corkage fee.     Yes.     Yes, that was on the initial invoice.     Yes.     Yes.     The increasing numbers.      Yes, Chair.    Ja.     No, it is roughly about 41 000, ja.     Yes.     That sounds more or less correct.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes, that is right.     That is not included.     That was why the corkage fee at the bottom of the invoice.     Or the last item listed on the invoice.     It was for them to allow to bring it in.     You can almost easily the amount of alcohol that was – I would even estimate almost doublethis invoice, ja.     Ja.     If I have to – my good guess, not even aquarter of that which would be sufficient for about 250 guests and that would have cost you about anything between R7’ to R10 000 on that stage.     R7 000 to R10 000.     And that was about three times more, delivered for this event.     I would give a rough estimate between R30’ to R40 000.     Just for liquor, ja.     Ja, definitely.     This is basically décor of the tables itself.     Which you will also see on page 17.     That was gifted by BOSASA that I know of.     And this is just of individual place settings and chair covers, etcetera, as well as flower arrangements.     For the event.    Ja, ja, just – or, you know, close, close up of an individual place setting.     Yes, it is.    For extra décor that we hired in for this event.     The first one on page 20 is for the wine that we obtained and we had serve.Page 22 …[intervenes]     Yes.     For the event itself, yes.     It is from Classic Function Hire to Victoria Guesthouse.     For chair covers and gold tieback tussles which …[intervenes]     Ja, 1 320.     And then a local hiring company in Krugersdorp as well, in Rant en Dal.     For extra tables and some cutlery.     Sorry, that is 23 and 24.     Ja.     Say again, sir?     For the function itself, ja.     Was 836 for the two invoices together.     Yes, 615.     Yes, it is, ja.     And then the second one from the same company is for R221.     It went on – I think it was half past three, quarter to four in the morning.     Yes.     Yes.     No, hopefully not.     Not – no, there was not.     Ja.     Exactly, ja.     I can …[intervenes]     I can definitely that it was definitely.     Yes and you say it was organised by Mr Agrizzi.     Agrizzi, ja.     Definitely, Chair.     Thank you.

MR MADLANGA:   Good afternoon Judge.   Thanks for giving us the opportunity and indulgence to appear this afternoon before the Commission.My client is Sandy Thomas.  We have been in consultation with Sandy for the past – when she received the first summons ...[intervenes]     From the onset Judge we have been representing Ms Sandy Thomas and last week we wrote correspondence to the Commission requesting an indulgence for us to consult with her together with the brief counsels in the matter who are not available today.  We have Advocate Moos Mpaga [?] and Advocate Manala on the brief, they are not available today and we only received the Notice in terms of Rule 3.3 last week on the 19 t h of August 2020 and we are of the view that, according to the rules we’re supposed to have 14 days upon which our client should respond and proceed but we’re making an undertaking to provide the affidavit to the Commission before the 2 n d of September 2020, hence we request an indulgence to have the matter stood down until the 2 n d ofSeptember for the legal teams to arrange and come and bring Ms Thomas before the Commission, that’s the request.  The letter details the reasons of our – the reasons why we request an indulgence from this Commission.    Yes Judge.    Ja she was supposed to be here at 9 o’clock.    Yes Judge.    Yes Judge.    Yes Judge, it’s exactly that error that we’re acknowledging, that we advised her to come this afternoon because whatever excuses she might be having, she needs to appear before the Commission and make this application before you Judge.  It was a serious error on our part, hence we’re requesting an indulgence from this Commission to grant the postponement, more in particular that she needs to be represented by counsel and counsel has to prepare affidavits on the matter.    She only drew to our attention the summons only last week Judge.    Yes Judge, but we wanted to deal, holistically with all the matters because there is an affidavit by Gina which implicates our client, we wanted to also deal with that affidavit.    Gina Peters.    Yes Judge, there is also – there is a correspondence that the Commission evidence leader is having, they’ve not fully responded to that letter.  We’re surprised to see a Notice – a summons now without first dealing with that correspondence of which we wererequesting some information.    No, I hear you – I hear you very well Judge.    Gina Peters yes Judge.    Yes.    Yes, together with summons.     It was sent, Judge last week.    It was sent separately last week Judge.   Short, but it was commissioned on the 11 t h of …[intervenes].    It is six pages.    Eight pages yes.    Yes Judge, Tuesday will be okay.    No, there’s no objection Judge we will find the affidavit…[intervenes].     On Friday, Judge, yes.     Thank you Commissioner. 
MADLANGA:I understand Judge, our sincere apologies Judge, I think, amongst the reasons – the reason why she’s here now, she’s here now is because of those summons that you will realise that it will be a serious error on her part or on the part of the legal team not to bring her here before the Commission.
MS THOMAS:  My apologies Your Honour, I wasn’t aware that, those were the procedures.    Yes, Your Honour.    I will do so sir.    Yes sir, thank you so much.
