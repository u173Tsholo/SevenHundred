CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Morning.  Mr Pretorius, before we start I just want to deal with something, so you may be seated for the time being.    Last week on Tuesday I expressed concern about the conduct of certain journalists, newspapers and editors and at the same time expressed my highest respect for many journalists, editors and newspapers who do their work professionally, ethically and with integrity. I expressed certain concerns with regard to the breach of certain regulations governing the proceedings of this Commission and the publication of witness statements before witnesses deal with the matters that are published prematurely.  Subsequent to that some have issued a response and arrangements were made for representatives of the Commission and SANEF to meet and discuss issues of mutual concern. The meeting did take place on Friday and the Commission was represented by the head of the legal team of the Commission Mr Paul Pretorius SC and the head of investigations Mr Nombembe.  A report was subsequently made to me and a statement was issued by the Commission.   I believe SANEF issued a statement as I understand the position both parties had an input on that statement and they were happy with it. I just want to take this opportunity to commend both SANEF and the representatives of the Commission who took part in that meeting for the spirit in which I am told in which the meeting was conducted on both sides with due recognition of the role played by both the Commission and the media in regard to the matters that are being investigated by this Commission. I thought it is important that I should mention this in this open hearing, because it was in an open hearing that I had made the remarks that I made last week and I thought that it would be necessary also that I read the statement about which both parties namely SANEF and the Commission are happy, which is the product of that meeting, because although subsequent to the issuing of that statement there has been mention in the media that a statement has been issued.  I am not aware that its full terms have been told to the public. I therefore just wish to read that statement, because I think it is very    I am sorry, Mr Agrizzi, Mr Pretorius asked whether those two pages at page 600 I think it is.    Whether they were from the black book and your answer was they were from the book now that does not say whether you talk about the black book or you talk about another book?    Did you say the first one was Ntuli?    N or M at the beginning?    N for Nellie?    Oh, okay, that was the surname?    Okay.    Ja.    Are you able to spell the second one, did you say Pinky?    Yes?    Okay, thank you and the last one was Bongs?    Oh, okay.  Thank you.    Was she a journalist too?    Just repeat the surname, the second name please?    The payment of journalists, was it just a once off thing that happened and that R30 000 was given to Mr Leshabane or was it a regular thing that happened with a certain amount of regularity like monthly, like the other payments that you have told us about or did it happen as and when need arose?    So are you saying that from a certain time to a certain time maybe to the time that you left Bosasa you know that certain journalists were paid by Bosasa on a monthly basis?    You do not know for sure that they were paid?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Is your situation then in regard to some of the people that you told us were being paid monthly by Bosasa you were able to tell me that some definitely did receive payments, because you were there when they were given payments, the money, or you gave the money yourself in regard to journalists, that is no single journalists that you were ever present when he/she was given money?    Thank you, but on what – but you issued or what you are able to say is that money was given to Mr Leshabane on a monthly basis that was said to be for certain journalists, but you do not know whether that money was actually paid to them?    Ja, but you can confirm that money was being issued on a monthly basis by Bosasa.    To Mr Leshabane?    Which he said was for the payment of certain journalists?    Oh, okay, well I was still to ask whether there was any positive stories written as a result of whatever payments may have happened.    Yes.    Yes, but do you know whether the journalist who may have wrote those stories their names coincided with the names that Leshabane may have mentioned to you?    Okay alright.    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Thank you.    Thank you Mr Agrizzi.    And Mr Mansell had come a long way with Mr Gavin Watson.  Is it not?    He had been his partner from sometime even before you arrived at Bosasa.  Is that right?    Yes, so.  Ja, okay thank you.    [Clearing throat] excuse me.  By the way was your evidence in relation to the payments that were made to Mr Gillingham after he had left Correctional Services was it to the same effect?  Were, were there fictitious invoices being made in that regard thereto or not really?    So, so you say he was fictitiously employed?    Which meant that in the books of Bosasa he was reflected as an employee of Bosasa, but he was actually not performing any work for Bosasa.  Is that right?    Oh okay, but he was not performing any work in that company either?    But the payment would it come from Bosasa straight to him or did it, was; did Bosasa pay to that company and that company would pay Mr Gillingham?    Okay, thank you.    Yes.  No that.    That is fine.    There is a noise that keeps on disturbing us.  I think somebody will attend to it to make sure we are not disturbed.    Yes.  Okay, thank you.    So was it around 2013 that the black book was introduced?    Ja.    Yes, okay.    Okay.  No that is fine.  I just wanted to have an idea.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    The black book that you say has been given to the Commission is, is it one that has been given to the investigators?    Okay.  I just want to make sure the record does not reflect as one has been put, as handed up.    Ja, ja.    Yes.    Okay, alright.    Ja that is fine.    That is fine.    Why do you say you can only presume now?  I thought earlier on or last week you or the week before if that was when I asked the question, I thought you said simply approximately or you said between four million to R6 million.    Without the presumption part.    No, no.  I, I accept that you are saying approximately, but saying approximately is one thing, but saying I presume is a complete different thing.    Okay.  You meant approximately?    Okay, thank you.    Okay.    So in, in that list you have included both people who were part of Bosasa and people who were not part of Bosasa as long as it is people to whom you did deliver cash?    Thank you.    Thandi Makoko was one of the Directors, hey of Bosasa?    Thank you.    That is Annexure U?    Thank you.    Did the IDT was making the payment on behalf of the Department of Justice?    They managed the project okay.    Thank you.    I am sorry.    And the paginated number is what?  693, 69 something else?    Okay.    Yes okay.    Yes.    So Mr Agrizzi are you saying that the figure at page 696 and the figure of R394 952,03 represents the two and a half management fee that is referred to – okay well now – maybe I should not say management fee.  2.5% referred to in paragraph 39.1 of your affidavit that you have just told us about?    Okay alright.    So the 2.5% management fee mentioned at page 695 at the bottom includes management fee other than what was paid to certain officials in the Department of Justice?    So the R2, something million includes the amount that would be paid to officials in the Department.  So in other words that 2.5% management fee what is referred to as management fee is overall and then included in it will be a portion that would ultimately go to officials in the Department of Justice, is that right?    Yes.  When you say over and above?  You say they – this was specific to this contract?    What they were getting?    But when this contract happened they or some of them were already being paid?    And this – their payments they received out of this contract was in additional to whatever they may have been receiving already before?    Okay alright.  Thank you.    Okay we will take the short adjournment and we will resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. MEETING ADJOURNS MEETING RESUMES    Before you proceed Mr Pretorius I just want to ask Mr Agrizzi one brief catering question.      From what you have said Bosasa was spending a lot of money on bribes on a monthly basis, is that correct?    Now how did it recover this money that it was spending on a monthly basis such as you said approximately R4m to R6m a month or was the position that its prices for the contracts were inflated to make provision for the payments that would be made in terms of bribes?    So in the end it is quite fair to say that the people, the taxpayers, the people were effectively being robbed of money that should go to the – to SARS which government would then use to deliver services for all the people, is that right?    Thank you.    Yes.    A drop in the ocean was the phrase you used.  Ja thank you.    Chair has got a very good memory.      No, no.    Before 39.3 at 39.2 you have those two names of officials from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development that you have mentioned.    Do you – do you – are you – did you ever witness them being given bribe money or did you yourself ever give them bribe money?    Both of those two officials mentioned in paragraph 39.2 namely Mams Nyambuse and Normal Thobane?    Was it on one occasion that you personally witnessed this?    In regard to both of them?    Yes.    Yes okay alright thank you, thank you.  Now we know that you also have mentioned before the name of the secretary of the commission and you said that you had no direct evidence yourself it is simply what you were told by Mr Seopela but in regard to this you say you had a personal knowledge of the payments?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and who else was present at that breakfast who was with you?    So was it four people having that meeting, yourself, Mr Joe Gumede and the two officials only?    Oh Ms Mams Nyambuse was not there?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes no, that is true.  Yes.    Yes okay thanks.  But in regard to the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development the names that you have told us in this paragraph and the name – the names in this paragraph of the two officials.    Are they the only ones in respect of whom you have direct evidence?    Yes.  Okay alright thank you.    Yes you do.    Yes you do.    Yes you do.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes okay.    Did you say – I am sorry.  Did you say it was paid to him cash or to me cash?    Yes by yourself?    Ja okay.    So in 2013 as you have told us Bosasa through Sondolo IT got a security systems contract from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development to the value of R601m and in the same year Bosasa was awarded a contract from Correctional Services in the amount – to the value of R420m where they say is per annum, is that right?    The R601m in respect of the contract from the Department of Justice that was just for the whole contract it was not per annum?    So already just from those two you over R1b  that one is talking about?    We have referred just now to the fact that there were other contracts that Bosasa got from government departments?    I seem to remember, but I may be mistake that we may have asked you to try and identify all the contracts that Bosasa may have had from government departments, national, provincial and parastatals, SOEs, is that something?  Because as Chief Operations Officer you would have known about all such contracts, is that right?    Yes, did we ask you to do that, or not?    Okay, you are working on it?    Oh, okay.  Mr Pretorius is aware of it?    Oh, okay, alright, thank you, because it would be important at some stage that we could have a full list of what contracts Bosasa and its affiliated companies may have had or did have with government, various government departments and parastatals at a certain time, if we could have that full picture for as long a time as possible, that would be great.  If not, maybe just at some stage maybe before Mr Agrizzi left it would be could to have a full picture and to be able to put a monitory value on that as well.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes, no, no that is fine.  I mean the government also should be able to identify all such contracts and make them available to the Commission.    Somebody who is central in the government department, maybe in the presidency somebody should get everybody to disclose what contracts Bosasa has had with them and details so that we have a full picture.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes, all subsidiaries of Bosasa as long as they had at some stage…[intervenes]    Contracts with government departments or SOEs.    Okay, thank you.    Well you said two things.  One was that the payment was for Mr Zuma and then you said the payment was for the foundation?    Which is which?    Okay, alright.    Okay.    You say it was always cash?    Is that, because you were involved in counting it or putting it together or how do you know it was always cash?    Do you remember when that was by any chance in terms of the year or round about what period?    Okay, okay.  Now was it on one occasion only that you personally witnessed cash being given to Ms Dudu Myeni?    It was a few occasions?    Did you yourself at any stage deliver this kind of cash to her?    And who delivered the cash to her on the occasions on which you witnessed this?    Okay, thank you.    And maybe before he does so the venue – you have mentioned the venue in respect of at least one occasion when cash was given to Ms Myeni and you were present and you said that was at the Sheraton Hotel in Pretoria, is that right?    And do you remember what the venues where in regard to any of the other occasions when you personally witnessed delivery of cash to her?    Yes.    Yes, so the two venues that you remember are the Sheraton Hotel and Bosasa premises?    Okay, alright, thank you.    And who placed it?    Thank you.    So you were not present when the bag was delivered to her, but she subsequently acknowledged to you that she had received the bag?    Thank you.    Yes?    Yes.    Thank you.    Yes.    Before you do so why was it that when she made requests you never asked questions you just did it as you have said?    In what way was she important and powerful?    Yes?    Okay, thank you.    Yes, thank you.    Oh, yes.    Okay, let us have a five minutes adjournment so that this is sort out.    So, Mr Pretorius did you lose about 20 minutes, 25 minutes?    Well I think it is not less than 20 minutes I think.  If possible we should compensate for it somewhere somehow.    Yes, your microphone is not on Mr Pretorius.    No, no, that is fine.  Yes, you may proceed.  I was about to say before the break is there a way in which was written in that letter can be enlarged?  I struggle to read what is written there.  I see some words, but I do not see everything, but of course if that can be done that can be done in due course, failing which or maybe irrespective of that Mr Agrizzi could read it if he himself is able to read the whole of it.  But even if that happens it would be good if we could have – if I can have an enlarged version of that letter from Ms Myeni.    Ja.    It looks like singular.    But later when it is enlarged it is fine, but read as – to the best to read what you see.    Yes.    The second paragraph looks like the family or…[intervenes]    Just start from the family again?    Okay, no thank you.    Yes, well it ends with Yours Faithfully and then it does say Ms D C Myeni and something Chairperson and something else underneath the signature and it is signed, is that right?    I am sorry, Mr Pretorius I have lost you in terms of paragraphs?    Maybe before that, I may have missed something, but I do not remember that the witness has covered certainly the second portion of 45.5 or did he?  I do not remember that he has.    Well…[intervenes]    Yes, he did and the cost of these functions, can he deal with that?    Is that per function on average?  Is that a number of functions together?    Per year?    Yes, yes.  Okay, alright.    Yes, okay.    Okay, thank you.  Yes, Mr Pretorius?    I am sorry, you say could demand that they appear, who is they and who was making the demand?    Oh, okay.    By coming to Bosasa′s offices?    Okay.    I am sorry.  Do you remember who the Minister of Mineral, Mineral Resources was at the time, but if you cannot remember it is fine?    Oh and do you, do you remember roundabout when this was occurring in terms of year?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    Did you attend the meeting with the former President and these other people you mentioned yourself?    Okay.  In terms of how it went you basing that on reports that you, on what you were told?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Yes, okay.    Hm.    Yes.    Do you know in what way the regulations were restrictive?  In other words what was wrong with them?  In what way were they restrictive that prompted the proposal that they should be amended?  In what way were they restrictive?  Do you know or is that detail that you do not know?    Okay.    Ja.    No that is fine.  That is fine.  Yes, you may continue.    Earlier on you said that you understood I think from Mr Gavin Watson that the R300 000 per month that was being given to Ms Dudu Myeni was for the foundation, the Jacob Zuma Educational Foundation.  Now you are saying that, [indistinct] Mr Gavin Watson was concerned that Mr Zuma was not getting the full R300 000.  Was he supposed to be getting that that money or was the money supposed to be received by the foundation?    Ja, but I am just wondering whether you, you are making your own conclusions or inferences based on what you saw or whether it is what Mr Gavin Watson said in conversations with you in terms of where exactly those; that monthly, those monthly payments were destined.    Yes.  What did he say about this R300 000?    Now, okay.  Now he told you this I assume after this particular occasion when he himself delivered the money?    Oh, okay.  Am I to understand from what you say you understood the position to be and from what you say Mr Gavin Watson told you?  Am I correct in understanding that the money was not destined for the foundation?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes, but you say Mr Gavin Watson reported back to you that he asked the former President a second question after putting the money next to him?    And the question was whether he was receiving the money that was being given to Ms Dudu Myeni every month?    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    I am, I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Mr Agrizzi as you; is your understanding, was your understanding that Mr Watson asked this question to Mr Zuma in the presence of other people?    Yes but, but your understanding is that it was only the three of them when he asked that question?    Joe Gumede.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay, alright.    Is that the one that was?    Where Bosasa played a role and bought the, where you designed the cake?    Not that one.    Okay.    Okay.  Bosasa did, contributed to a number of the former President’s birthday parties over the years.    Okay and you cannot remember which one.    But it was after one of those?    Okay, alright.    Okay.  We, we will adjourn and resume at 2 o’ clock.      We adjourn.    Yes, Mr Pretorius.    What did she say the NPA said was closing down?    Is that the investigation?    Okay.    That is correct.    Okay thank you.  The picture in relation to or that reflects the carpet there is there an existing picture that is – that shows the true colours of the carpet or can it be done to show the true colours or is this the true – are these the true colours of the carpet?    Okay, alright, thank you.    Yes.    Do you know whether it would have been family members or not really necessary?    Oh okay.    Okay thank you.    So you entered the room where Ms Myeni was on the sixth floor at the Sheraton Hotel and you did so together with Mr Gavin Watson and she was sitting at a corner on the left hand side of the room as you come out of the elevators that is right?     The two of you that is yourself and Mr Gavin Watson joined her and you sat at the table?    But when you wanted to look at the docket or file that she gave you, you moved to another spot within the same room?    Oh but where you were sitting were you throughout within her sight?    Yes.    Yes, yes.  Okay thank you.    Okay.  Thank you.    Thank you.    Please just repeat that he said what?    Yes.  This was now back at Bosasa or on your way back?    Oh when you got back to the table?    Okay.    Oh how was he aware if Ms Myeni was not aware?    Oh he became aware after the meeting?    Ja okay.    What was Ms Myeni’s response to this request by Mr Watson that the investigation or the matter should be shut down immediately?    Okay.  Thank you.    Alright what was you purpose of taking these photos at that time?    Oh it was just to obtain the information without having to write it all down okay.  Thank you.    Okay thank you.    Ja.    Well when was that?    Oh okay so it would have been before May 2009?    Okay.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Director at Bosasa?    So with regard to the Bosasa investigation Bosasa had Mr Watson and yourself on the one side dealing with Mr Mti who you told us would have interactions with the NPA or certain people at the NPA but on the other there was also Mr Trevor Mathenjwa who was dealing with the same issue but through Ms Myeni?    Okay.    Do you know whether Mr Watson first dealt with Mr Myeni before they dealt with the President or met the President or whether they met the President or dealt with the President before Ms Myeni came into the picture?    Yes.    Yes.    And do you know how Bosasa or Mr Gavin Watson came to meet with Ms Myeni in the first place, how that happened or how that relationship started?    Okay thank you.    Thank you.    And before you do say that this was a different meeting from the one you told us about where Mr Gavin Watson you said took some money to the former President with him?    That is a separate one this one is a separate one?    Okay.    Okay.    Mr Pretorius I interrupted you.    And who was said not to be taking Ms Nomvula Mokonyane’s calls?    Oh, okay.  Mr Anwa Dramat what was his position at the time in the HAWKS?    You do not know, alright.    Would the former President make that request to Mr Gavin himself or would that come through somebody else?    Is that Mr Nkabinde or Mr Sekgotla?    You say you knew that he was very close to Mr Tom Moyane?    Okay, thank you.    I am sorry before you go there.  In regard to what you call the second agreement you said in terms of that agreement payment of R10-million was required and Mr Gavin Watson refused to pay that amount and in regard to what you referred to as the first agreement R5-million was required to be paid and it was paid?    Yes.  Now with regard to the second so called agreement you are not suggesting that the figure of 10-million had previously been agreed between Bosasa and Mr Sekgota but then Mr Watson reneged on the agreement, that is not what you are saying or is that what you are saying?    Oh, he previously agreed?    Okay, before it was signed, it could be signed?    Yes, okay, thank you.    This was a team of how many people if you are able to tell more or less?    Yes.  Who were more or less the standing team to do this, the special projects?    Okay, alright.  Proceed.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    And no invoices were, would be sent to the recipients of these benefits?    Yes.    The Special Project existed from when if you are able to remember?    Or a special team, Special Projects Team.    Yes.    And when you left Bosasa was the, was this Special Projects Team still in operation?    Okay.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  It looks like there is nobody from the administration wing here.  I gave permission at the beginning of the hearing in August for only a certain number of TV cameras to be inside this hall, but I seem to see a number of cameras now.  Somebody will just have to investigate, because I have not given permission for anymore cameras since then, because if there are any challenges there are channels for request to be made and things must not just be done anyhow.    Well.    There is a camera at the back that I believe has been there since the beginning or at least there has been a camera there.  I do not know if it is the same that has also been there, but there are others that I see other than those here at the front which there seems to be others in respect of which I have not given permission. The administration will have to investigate what is happening.  Thank you.  You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    So how many people were in that meeting?  Yourself.    Andries van Tonder.    Thank you.    You would like it colder?  You would like it to be a little cold?    Cold.    Ja.  Okay.  They will do so.  It must not be too cold.    I, I have a little bit of flu.  So, but they will make it a little cooler.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh.    Well, well Mr Agrizzi do tell us whenever you would like a break or when we are taking too long.  You know, I was saying this morning we must make up for the time that we lost when there was a problem with, online.  If, if.    If, if there is any problem please let, let, let us know and we will try and accommodate you.    As far as we can, but I did want to take a few minutes break at this time.  Can we take a break and we will resume at 25 to four?    Thank you.    We adjourn.    Yes, Mr Pretorius.    Mr Pretorius will ask you, will tell you.    Yes, thank you.    Without saying you were leaving, without putting I a letter of resignation?    Oh you did?    Verbally or in writing?    Oh okay.    Well just remind me again I have good recollection that Mr Mansell for example had been Mr Gavin Watson’s partner from a long time previously and you have mentioned Doctor Smith from time to time but I think you have just said you resigned to him or you told him or you gave him the letter?    What was he at Bosasa?    Yes.    Yes okay.    Yes okay.  And what was his reaction?    Okay thank you.    Thank you.    Well before he says that I – he must just confirm – Mr Agrizzi you must confirm.  I think Mr Pretorius skipped another event that you mentioned in that sequence namely the attorney’s call to you before the visit by Mr Cheeky Watson.    Okay, alright.    Per annum or?    Over ten years?    Okay.  Now you mentioned here Mr Cheeky Watson and you may have mentioned him once or so earlier I am not sure in the statement.    What was his position if any in Bosasa?  I know from what you have said that he was Mr Gavin Watson’s brother but was he a director at Bosasa or what was he?    Oh so this – this – he had no formal position or position in Bosasa as such?    But he came to you on this occasion.    To – at the request of or on behalf of Mr Gavin Watson?    And he made the offer that you have told me about?    Sorry?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Was it the attractive terms of the proposed agreement that made you change your mind about not wanting to continue at Bosasa or by the time they put the offer to you you had had second thoughts?  What was the position?    Okay.  Thank you.    What page is that Mr Pretorius – the agreement?    Okay I just want the actual?    Agreement because I did look for it.    Thank you.    I am sorry you said you were given a professor?    Yes to help you do what?    Oh pursuant to this agreement?    Okay.    Maybe before that in terms of this presentation.    Or your proposal as to how to take Bosasa forward did that document contemplate that there would no longer be these payments of bribes and so on?    Okay alright.  Thank you.    Or maybe before you get there again.    Around about when in the year was it when this presentation was made?    Yes.    Yes and subsequent – or did this proposal that you made did it contemplate that implementation would start soon or was implementation to start quite sometime in the future?    Okay.    Yes.  Okay thank you.    That is Mr Gavin Watson?    Between – between your return to Bosasa in terms of that agreement that you concluded with Mr Watson for going back to Bosasa.    Between your return to Bosasa and November 2016 other than the presentation that sought to show how you would take Bosasa forward were there any aspects of that agreement that were implemented or were contemplated would be implemented in the meantime during that period and were they implemented?    Okay thank you.    Did you think that at this stage after you had returned Mr Gavin Watson believed that you no longer wanted to be involved in corruption and you never – you no longer wanted the company to be involved in corruption?    Thank you.    Of course you did give evidence and you must tell me if my recollection of your evidence is not correct.  You did say that in the early years after you had joined Bosasa or Jumbo as it was called.    Initially the Jumbo had been involved in some corruption in regard to contracts that it had obtained from private companies, mining companies and so on or did I misunderstand your evidence?    Yes okay thank you.    But also I see you remember the amount but you do not remember the name.    But there are lots of amounts and names that you have remembered that you have told us about over the past what two weeks now?    Ja no I am sure we will finish tomorrow.  I had reservations whether we would finish tomorrow but seeing where we are now I am sure we will finish tomorrow with Mr Agrizzi.    Your request is for tomorrow not for today hey?  Your request for us to sit and finish?    Ja.  Okay.  Should we – should we not start earlier tomorrow?    Well let me say [intervenes].    Yes.  No, no.  Well let me not [intervenes].    Let me not ask for your – a formal – for your response now but I am considering and I would like to hear from the legal team.  I am considering that we should possibly begin to start earlier than ten o’clock and maybe finish at five instead of four.  I am serious that we should try and as far as possible finish the hearing of evidence, oral evidence at some stage this year in regard to the work of this commission.  There may be challenges but I would like us to try and do what we can.  I know that sometimes we do need some time in the morning to deal with certain things and I will take that into account.  Reflect on that and then we can talk in due course to see whether there would be any insurmountable challenges if we were to do that.      Yes, no what I have just said is more in general terms as opposed to tomorrow but I would like if possible to start early tomorrow if you say from the legal team particularly from yourself maybe half past nine that would be fine.  Then we could – if we are able to start with that application and if – that is if the lawyers involved can be informed and they can make it earlier then we do it.  If not we deal with it at some stage in the course of the morning.  But if there are going to difficulties we stick to ten o’clock and we start with that application.  When we finish we continue with Mr Agrizzi but in relation to just generally the times for starting and the times for finishing please reflect on that and we can talk in due course.  So what is your feeling as to whether half past nine might be fine tomorrow.  As I said if it is going to problematic especially coming as late as it is coming now then we can stay with ten o’clock.    Might be problematic.    Okay.    Okay alright.    Ja that is – that is fine ja.    I am sorry for I think the aircon – the noise of the aircon behind me is drowning your voice now.    Okay alright.    Well shall we say we will resume at ten tomorrow?  Because the lawyers know about ten o’clock.    Yes, yes, ja.    Okay we are going to adjourn now.  We will resume at ten o’clock tomorrow morning.  We adjourn. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Morning, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Agrizzi on Friday, I am sorry, on Thursday last week you gave evidence in regard to certain journalists being paid by Bosasa, do you recall that?    That statement or that evidence was not in the original statement submitted to the Commission, correct?    As a result the investigators had not yet had any chance to investigate the allegations to look at whether they are matters that require further investigation firstly and to test their voracity.  Those investigations have begun and are ongoing, you are aware of that?    But it is perhaps important to elaborate on your own evidence in this regard, which you have now provided to this Commission.    In a little more detail than previously.    And by previously I mean than testified to on Thursday last week.  How did this payment begin?  In other words the process of payment who got how much money for what purpose?    Alright, before you go on, let us just take it step by step please?  Papa Leshabane requested R30 000 from you for the purpose of paying journalists?    Did you record this information in your black book?    Okay, let us just look at page 600 of EXHIBIT S2 please?  There are two pages copied there.  Are these pages from your black book?    The page…[intervenes]    Yes.    And that is the book you have been speaking about in evidence?    And if you look at page 600 two pages are copies on that page 600.  The page on the left hand side and at the top of that left hand column are some words.  What are those words?    Yes.    Okay, you need not go into the other names, because we are not dealing with that evidence now.    We are just dealing with the reference to journalists.    Are there other references in the black book to the amount of R71 000 being paid to Papa Leshabane?    Well we can point those out to the extent necessary.  What was the purpose to your knowledge of the payment to Papa Leshabane, who if I understand your evidence required the money to pay journalists?    Alright.  You say the one person – purpose of the payment as communicated to you by Mr Leshabane was to write positive articles about Bosasa?    And the other?  Was there any other purpose?    When did these payments commence to the best of your recollection?    Alright.  Did Papa Leshabane mention any names to you?    In relation to the journalists who would be receiving the amount of R30 000?    What names did he give you?    Bongs[spelt].    Apart from the information given to you by Leshabane regarding the names of the persons for whom he required the R30 000 do you have any other evidence to confirm or to question whether those three persons actually received the money?    That is a different issue, but let us deal with it.    Did Bosasa employ media consultants?    Who did Bosasa employ in this regard?    What was the purpose of the employment of the media consultants you have just mentioned?    Do you have any further detail in that regard?    Alright, is that Adriaan Basson?    Do you know anything about threats against these journalists and how those originated to your knowledge?    What is a burner phone?    Not properly registered in terms of the legislation?    Yes, well explain please?    Do you know of any journalist that was in fact threatened in this way?    Alright.  There will be further evidence in this regard.  The investigators are obtaining it and it will be placed before you, Chair.    And the investigators are dealing with that issue, Chair.  For clarity Mr Agrizzi Stephen Laufer and Benedicta Dube were not, as I understand your evidence, journalists, they were media consultants employed by Bosasa to deal with journalists?    And there will be further evidence in that regard in due course.  Whilst we are dealing with the role and function of journalists you recall that on Sunday in The Sunday Times on page 3 an article appeared with seemed to suggest that you were going to leave the country.    Was the content of that article ever put to you before its publication?    That is the SABC eight?    Sorry, let us just take it step by step.    Because it may be confusing.    I certainly have no intention of dealing with the news report.    About the SABC eight, but you have offered that to the Chair by way of background?    If we may just put that issue aside for the moment.    The article that appeared in the Sunday Times under the by-line Bongani Fuzile was on page 3 and that is the article that I would like you to deal with briefly please.  It suggests that you were intending leaving the country, selling up and leaving the country.  Correct?    So two things I want to deal with if we may and if necessary further evidence can be lead in due course.  Firstly were you ever asked for your opinion on the so called sources and the conclusions suggested in the article?    So the answer to the question is you were not contacted?    Is there any truth in the suggestion made in the article that you intend to leave the country on a permanent basis?    Right.  Mr Agrizzi I am not going to go through each and every allegation or suggestion made in the article save for one.  Have you moved home and are you selling your house?    Would you just look at the document that I am going to give to you?  Chair I am going to hand up a copy of the document for the bundle.  It does not yet have a page number, but that will be done in due course.    The document now being shown [intervenes].    Is that the article about which we have been speaking?    Thank you.  Right.  May we return then Mr Agrizzi to your statement?    We had told the Chair or at least you had told the Chair that the emigration of Mr Mansell to the United States of America had been organised.    Reach for a Dream.    And the clothes are those the clothes that you collect for your daily use?    Alright.  Let us get back to the statement if we may.  Paragraph 37.3 I think is where we left off.  That is on page 79 of your statement.  Do you have that?    Mansell having left was any arrangement made to take over his tasks?    Was the arrangement that Gavin Watson would issue invoices in respect of his payments?    Right.    But the arrangement on the instruction of Gavin Watson as I understand your evidence was that invoices would be issued by Mr Mansell and you had to ensure that these invoices were paid.    An example of one such invoice is Annexure S which appears at 568 of Bundle S2, but it is not necessary for us to go there Chair.  It is there if anyone wants to look at it.  What I want to ask you about the work specified on the invoice was that work actually done or was that a fictitious invoice?    And if that amount was actually deducted as an expense in the books of Bosasa that would have tax implications?    The management of the payments to the Gillingham family and the dealings with the Gillingham family in particular Patrick Gillingham was that task entrusted to you?    Right.  Then in paragraph 37.6 you talk about the management of both Mr Mti and Mr Gillingham’s tax returns.    Tell the Chair about that please.    Apart from assistance with tax shortfalls was; do you have any evidence of any instruction to mislead the South African Revenue Services in the presentation of these returns?    No, in terms of the individual returns of Messieurs Mti and Gillingham.  You say Mr Venter was instructed to prepare their tax returns.    Now what I want to ask you is there any evidence that you have of any instruction to Mr Venter to mislead the South African Revenue Service in those returns in any way?    Yes.    So as I understand it apart from assistance given to Mr Mti and Mr Gillingham in relation to assistance with tax shortfalls you have no evidence of any unlawful activity on the part of Mr Venter?    Alright.  So it is no, there is no need to take that allegation any further for the present?    In paragraph 37.7 you detail evidence that you have already given, but for the sake of completeness let us just deal with it.  In paragraph 37.7 you talk of payments made to Mr Gillingham.  Just tell the Chair what you are saying in paragraph 37.7 please.    Thank you.  Until what time and if you can remember the month were payments made to Mansell, to your knowledge?    Let us move then to paragraph 38.  You refer to an incident there that occurred during approximately 2013 as you describe it?    What happened?    We are trace it, but not successfully Chair.    Did Mr Gavin Watson then issue an instruction?    And did you handle the cash?    Functions alone?    Who was that other person?    Is it at this stage then that the little black book system was introduced?    The black book that you have shown to the investigators and to the Commission is still available in its original form?    As are certain lists still available in their original form?    But the black book that you have shown to the Commission is one of several?    And the only one that you have is the one that you have shown to the Commission?    Prior to the use of the black book system is it correct, do I understand your evidence that you have given correctly that lists were kept on loose pages?    And there are examples of those too in the bundle and originals you have given to the Commission?    Alright.  Annexure T1 to T.    Yes Chair.    Yes we, we have the original which we can hand up.    Chair, but it is at the moment in the possession of the investigators.    In safekeeping.    It is been retained for, obviously for evidential purposes.    And [intervenes].    The copies however are in the bundle.  You have obviously worked with Annexures T1 to T56.  Are you able to confirm that those documents are copies of pages in the black book?    And we have referred to them from time to time.  We are not going to go through 56 pages now, but they are available for further evidence if required.    You have already given us evidence in answer to questions from the Chair, but in paragraph 38.4 you estimate the total amount paid in bribes per month.  What is that amount?    And then you repeat the system that was employed in relation to the distribution of cash and the use of security bags.  You have given that evidence and we do not need to repeat it, but in your own records amongst others the black book of which we have spoken you record cash you delivered to various people within Bosasa for later distribution.  Who were those people?    There are two other names that appear on the list.  In paragraph 38.    So we can delete Gillingham’s name?    From that list.    Alright.    Is that a complete list of persons who were instructed to deliver the cash received from you to other people?    Right.  Is it also a complete list of persons who received money from you for their own use [intervenes]?    Only Gillingham?    Right.    Thank you Mr Agrizzi.  Let us move on then to paragraph 39.  The paragraph refers to a contract being awarded to Sondolo IT during approximately 2013 as you say.  Would you tell the Chair of the matters concerning that contract?    Is that for the Department of Justice and Constitutional Department?    Is Sondolo IT as you have already stated part of the Bosasa stable of companies?    Right, continue please.    So as I understand that arrangement payments would be made on behalf or by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development in respect of that particular security system contract?    The value of that contract you say was R601m?    2.5% of all monies received pursuant to services rendered under that contract received by Sondolo IT I presume were then returned you say to certain individuals in the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development?    Would you look at Annexure U please.      I will help you now.  That is at page 691 of Exhibit S2.  Would you go there please.      Annexure U, bundle S2, page 693 the documents – page 692 the document starts.    What is that document?    Yes please particularly to the end where the calculation is made.    By whom, to whom?    That is the Independent Development Trust?    Page 696.     696 is page 5.    Well it would make it easier for the record if you refer to the number in the top right hand corner that is the number in the bundle.    695 we must go to.    Yes.    When was this schedule prepared?     Does that date appear at the bottom of page 696?    Well just in case someone does the math Mr Agrizzi if one goes to page 696.  I am not sure whether that R394 952,03 is 2.5% of R96m?    Right so we are not looking at the total amount in all those schedules we are simply saying that it is not an amount of R15 000 it is R15m?  I think you said R15 000,00?    R15 798 081,19.    And you say if one does the maths 2.5% of that will be R394 952,00 is that correct?    And in relation to this particular contract reflected on the schedule on the pages we referring to and particular page 696 an amount of R2m had already been provided, am I correct?    Then in paragraph 39.2 you talk about security guarding services.  What happened there?    Did Mr Gumede tell you for whom these amounts or some of these amounts were required?      What did he tell you?    Right Nyambuse you spell here at least N-u-n-y-u-m-b-u-s-e?    Are these names recorded anywhere in your black book?    Would you do so please.    So that we can tell the Chair if their names appear there or they do not appear there?    Yes do not do it now perhaps you can do it in the short   adjournment which is now anyway Chair.    You gave evidence early on Mr Agrizzi dealing with the amounts spent on bribes what you say is approximately R4m to R6m per month and you mentioned to the Chair that that in relation to the overall turnover and profits of the Bosasa Group of Companies as a whole was you said a very small amount?    Alright if we can go on then please to clarify just two items in paragraph 39.2.  You mentioned the name of Mr Norman Thobane.  Can you recall what position he held in the Department of Correctional Services?    Yes my error I mentioned the wrong department.  And how – you also say you became sorry Chair did you want to ask a question?    How did you become aware of those two names as recipients of money as you were told?    Then if we can go to paragraph 39.3.  But before we go on let us go back to paragraph 38.4.  At the end of that paragraph is a list of names.  It appears on page 81.    Do you see that?    We discussed this list earlier this morning?    And you said that there were two categories of persons in this list.  The fist category was those persons to whom monies were paid principally people employed within the Bosasa stable.    For onward payment to others?    And you also said that this list included persons to whom payments were made directly for their benefit and use?    So this list here included names of persons to whom monies were paid for their own benefit?    Then I asked you is that a complete list of persons to whom monies were paid for their own benefit that you actually observed, remember and you mentioned Mti and Gillingham as being those persons.  It seems to me that there are now others to whom you observed monies being given?    Right so let me go back to that question.  How many people did you actually observe yourself being given money or whom you gave money to directly for their own benefit?    Yes would you do so please.    In other words persons in respect of whom you have direct evidence?    As opposed to having been told by others.    If we could go back then to paragraph 39.3 and you there discuss.    You mentioned a specific meeting involving Mr Thobane?    Do you recall a specific meeting involving the other person mentioned Ms Nyambuse?    Let us move on to paragraph 39.3 then.  There you discuss a contract with the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development for security upgrades?    Tell the Chair about those please?    Do you know if that money was ever paid?    Alright in short then.    In order to facilitate the transaction which you have just described?    I understand but you also say that you do not know if Mr Seopela paid that money over to anyone and even if he did you do not know who received the money?    In short then the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development rented premises in a building?    The landlord was the Billion Group?  Security upgrades were instructed or requested by the Department for which upgrades the Billion Group would in terms of the arrangements be liable?    Billion Group resisted payment and for that reason certain arrangements were made with Mr Seopela?    Do you know if the contract was ever paid for?    Alright.  If we can move onto the third catering contract for Correctional Services mentioned in paragraph 40.1 of your affidavit.  Please tell the Chair of the circumstances relevant there?    And of course as we understand from your evidence there were many other contracts current at the time?    The contract referred to in paragraph 40 the third catering contract for Correctional Services you say that was awarded to Bosasa?    Or a company in the Bosasa Group?    Do you know what the approximate profit margin was in that contract?  In other words what potion or percentage of the R420m per annum was profit?    GP being Gross Profit?    Yes and the profit margins in respect of the other contracts to which you have referred the Chair were they similar?    Alright.    Yes, Chair.  There is the work Mr Agrizzi that the investigators are busy with and will continue to work on and then there is your own memory and I think what the, Chair, wants from you if you would cooperate please is what your own memory and records can produce.    May we move on Mr Agrizzi to your affidavit at paragraph 41?    When did you meet Ms Dudu Myeni for the first time?    Alright, arising from your own duties in relation to the payment of cash and the recordal of cash payments for various persons as you have testified were you aware of any payment relevant to Ms Myeni?    Which foundation?    What position, to your knowledge, did Ms Myeni occupy at the time?    In respect of the foundation?    Alright.  So…[intervenes]    That is what you were told?    And how was that payment made?  Cash, cheque?    And to whom was that payment made?    Alright.    Were you ever present when cash was delivered to Ms Myeni?    Which year?    Would you relate the incident to the, Chair, please that you refer to in paragraph 41.3 in your affidavit?    Alright, will you tell the, Chair, please of the incident in paragraph 41.3 of your affidavit?    Delivered it to whom?    Alright, so he delivered a Louis Vuitton handbag, purchased in circumstances to which you have now referred, R300 000 was placed in the bag.  How do you know that?    Alright, now you are moving very fast through the facts and it is important that we take them step by step.    Mr Agrizzi.    Arrangements were made for the purchase of the handbag?    The handbag was delivered to Bosasa, was it?    Correct, and then you say R300 000 in cash was placed in the bag?    Did you observe that?    Do you know what happened…[intervenes]    Do you know what happened to the bag with the cash inside?    How do you know that?    Alright, and…[intervenes]    Did you receive any report from Mr Gavin Watson in relation to the fate of the handbag and the cash that you placed in the bag?    Alright, did he say anything about the money in the bag?    Okay.  The payments of R300 000 were these regular payments?    Were there in fact more than one – or was there in fact more than one payment?    How do you know that?    Do these details appear in code or otherwise in your black book or on your list?    Would you check that please for us?  Whether her name appears in code or otherwise in your black book or on your list?    And you were, may I remind you that you were also going to check the two other names?  Was there any other relationship between Ms Myeni and Gavin Watson or Bosasa by any other relationship I mean were there any other activities or favours or benefits according to yourself afforded to or through Ms Myeni?    Would you look at EXHIBIT S2 please at page 697?    Because she was very, very important.  She could swing deals and she was powerful.    In fact Mr Agrizzi you deal with the Karoo fracking transaction and the involvement of Ms Myeni.    In the very next paragraph, but before we get there, ca we please look at page 698 of EXHIBIT S2?    What is this document?    Alright, it is dated 14 April 2016.    We appear to have gone offline, Chair.    Yes, Chair?    Thank you. MEETING ADJOURNS MEETING RESUMES    About 30 minutes.    I am sure we can do so, if we may at the end of the day.    If we could do so, Chair, at the end of the day rather than the long adjournment.    We will arrange that, Chair.    Do you know what this letter says?  You do not have to read it, you are familiar with its contents?    It is apparently signed by Ms D C Myeni Executive Chairperson Jacob G Zuma Foundation.    And what is this letter?    It is addressed to Mr Watson?    Yes?    Patron singular.    No, patron.    With care.    If we may move on then to paragraph 41.6 and there you relate Mr Agrizzi the circumstances to which you referred earlier in particular the contemplated Karoo fracking transaction and the dealings between personnel of Bosasa, Ms Myeni and notionally at least President Zuma.  Would you briefly tell the, Chair, of those circumstances?    Paragraph 41.6 and can we just spell Rahadkhrishna[spelt] continue please?  We have it here.    Well he did not mention the Executive Chef, he has not dealt with that, but I thought we could move on.    41.5 the witness has testified, Chair, that Ms Myeni would often call on Bosasa and Mr Watson to arrange functions at short notice.    Right, 41.6 in your affidavit you were dealing with or you were about to deal with the Karoo fracking transactions and circumstances related to that transaction.    Before you go on, I am sorry to interrupt, but we must spell that, because I am sure the transcriber will not pick up that spelling, it is Phillip?    Yes, thank you.    Who has influence over the President?    Before you go on please Mr Agrizzi.    Do you know if the amendments to what you refer were ever in fact brought about?    Alright.  Just look at the last sentence in paragraph 41.7.  There you say I do not know if these amendments were in fact affected.    So which is correct?    Were they or were they not?    Let us just summarise that then.  Before you were told about the meeting that you referred to in paragraph 41.9 leave aside that evidence for the moment.  Before that what you knew was that regular payments of R300 000 per month were made in cash to Ms Dudu Myeni for you were told the Jacob Zuma Foundation?    That is all you knew?    You had your own doubts and questions that arose in your mind, but as far as you were told and as far as the information you had to hand the purpose of the cash payments were for transfer via Ms Myeni to the Jacob Zuma Foundation?    Then the incident occurred that you refer to in paragraph 41.9 you know about that from amongst others Mr Gavin Watson and anyone else?    Did they tell you what happened at that meeting.    Right and just briefly tell the Chair what happened at that meeting without commentary just exactly what you were told.    At that same meeting.    Thank you.  Paragraph 41.10 you refer to different issues being discussed at a meeting.  Is this the same meeting to which you have just referred?    Meeting with the former President at Nkandla?    Tell the Chair about that please.    Alright.  You say that the President made the calls at that meeting or later?    Alright.  So your evidence is that you learnt from persons or a person present at the meeting that a concern was raised on behalf of Bosasa that the Hawks were investigating Bosasa.  Correct?    And your evidence is that you heard as well that President Zuma there agreed to make a call to an official or officials at the Hawks so that a meeting could be arranged between the Hawks on the one hand and Gumede representing Bosasa on the other?    And you say you know from Mr Gumede that a meeting ultimately took place between the Hawks and Mr Gumede on behalf of Bosasa?    You do not know that the phone calls between the President and the Hawks took place.  You are inferring that.    Well we will get to the recordings later, but you do not know whether the meeting between the Hawks and Gumede was actually the result of a phone call that the former President had made other than from your interpretation of the transcript to which we are going to now refer?    No, no, no.  It is, I am just asking for fact at this stage.    So argument will be placed and submissions will be made in due course to the Chair, but as a matter of fact.    That is all I am asking.  I am not asking for whether that fact is probable or possible.  We just want to know what you know factually.    And you were told that the call was made because the meeting took place?    Right.  So it is apparent that Mr Gumede too may have been making an inference from what he knew.    Alright, but let us not go too deeply into that, because you have given evidence as to what you know.  You corroborate or you seem to corroborate the evidence which you have given by reference to two transcripts.  Now these have been discussed with you in some detail.  Chair I must say that this is apparently a single recording from which two extracts have been made.  It is a recording of a later meeting which appears to suggest that certain events took place prior to that in relation to the Hawks meeting with Mr Gumede, but the transcript that we dealt with over the weekend is a, not accurate and b, not complete and c, does not necessarily deal with the parts that the witness wished to refer to.  So they are under construction.    Today and will be referred to, to the extent necessary later.    So we can then move on if can and Mr Agrizzi you have given your assistance in relation to the proper transcription and the selection of those portions relevant to the evidence you wish to give?    Yes and the investigators will assist you in this regard and the evidence will be placed before the Chair once that process is complete.  Let us go however to paragraph 41.11.  Before we go there, alright.  Let us just complete one aspect.  The meeting at Nkandla to which you have just referred involving two issues the Hawks investigation and the delivery of money to former President Zuma.  Can you recall more or less when that meeting took place?    Which birthday party?  He has had several I presume.    The thank you letter.    You refer to at page 698 of Bundle S2 is dated 14 April 2016.    And then the meeting concerning the Karoo franking translation can you say more or less when that occurred?    Right, thank you.  Alright, Chair it is five past one.  So we made up five minutes.  May we adjourn?    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Agrizzi may I ask you to go back very briefly to paragraph 41.3?    What were the arrangements made for the purchase of the handbag referred to here that according to your evidence was given to Ms Myeni?    Alright.  So your; Gavin Watson asked you for advice?    He or you asked for your wife’s advice?    Your wife suggested the purchase of a handbag?    And it was your wife, do I understand your evidence now that arranged for the purchase of a Louis Vuitton handbag?    Thank you.  Can we then go please to paragraph 41.11?  You say that one afternoon you received a request or an instruction from Gavin Watson?    Would you detail that please?    Alright, before you go to the physical movements that you are describing did Mr Watson tell you anything of what he had apparently learnt from Ms Myeni?    Alright.  You say you travelled in the same car as Mr Watson with him obviously.  Were any preparations made for the meeting?    How much?    In cash?    Where did you go with Mr Watson then?    Alright and when you arrived at the hotel where did you go?    Can you recall which floor?  It may become important.    Alright.  Who attend the meeting that ensured?    Did she give you any information at that stage or at the commencement of the meeting?    She gave you certain documents?    Did she tell you what those documents were?    Right.  Did you respond?    Was Dudu Myeni’s attitude in regard to the making of copies of those documents made clear to you?    Ms Myeni.    Did she make clear to you her attitude as to whether you could or should make copies of the documents she was showing you?    What did you then do?    How did you, did you take photographs?    When you say down what do you mean?    Would you look at Annexure Y which appears on page 710 of Bundle S2 please?    Or perhaps you should go to page 711.  Page 711 appears to be a copy, photograph of a document.  Is this the photograph that you took?    And it continues through to page 726.  Do you see that?    Obviously from your evidence you cannot say precisely what documents these are.  You can only say what they appear to you to be.  Correct?    Right.  The heading in the box at the top of page 711    There is then a reference to offences under investigation which appeared to include fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering?    And then at the bottom of the page is a table which is headed Status of The Investigation.      This document appears to continue and on page 714 there is a table which shows various officials of Law Enforcement agencies that appear to be involved in the processes set out in this documentation?    I just want to draw your attention to one of those names and that is NPA Prosecutor Advocate MC De Kock?  We have heard about her earlier in your evidence?    And then on the next page, page 715 is another table    I am not sure what that means but amongst the names there listed is your own name against the figure 3?    Other names mentioned are Mr Gillingham, Mr Mti, Mr Mansell, Doctor Smith, Andries Van Tonder, Carlos Bonifacio and Riaan Hoeksma.  It may be noted for present purposes that Mr Watson’s name does not appear here.  Do you know why?    Alright.  If you know why as a matter of fact?    The document continues and we need not go into much detail because the document will speak for itself.  But I would like to take you please to page 721 and 724.  Do you see the background to the documents there that dark background with the pattern on it?    Perhaps you could go to page 725 where that background appears more extensively and clearly.      Do you know what that background is?    A carpet pattern?    And do you know whether the investigators have made their own investigations regarding that pattern and any links that that pattern might have to the carpet on the sixth floor of the Sheraton Hotel?    Yes there will be independent evidence in that regard Chair.    Do you have the cell phone on – from which these pictures were taken?    Except as I understand it you do not have the original photograph?    Right and the set of documents which you say looked like a police docket did you keep any documents or did you return them to Ms Myeni?    And did you do that?    Did you however keep the photograph on your cell phone and were these originally or were these eventually printed for the purposes of your own records?    What did you give to the investigators?    Right in print form?    Well you kept what after the Sheraton meeting?    You kept it on your cell phone?    You then gave your cell phone away at some stage?    Did you keep the documents, the printout of the photographs?    I understand and you say that is where the metadata will also appear?    Thank you.      Do you know whether the electronic record of the photographs on your computer would show the date on which the photographs were taken?      Do you know what those dates are, can you remember?    Because the investigators have also done a separate investigation in relation to who stayed at the hotel over that period and that evidence will be placed before you Chair.  It is in the affidavit of Mr Dutton that I referred to in opening.    Did Mr Watson make any requests of Ms Myeni at that meeting?    The request or demand that the matter be shut down was it is rather obvious a request to the contemplated criminal proceedings related to Bosasa and its officials?    And that request it is reasonably clear from your evidence was made to Ms Myeni?    We can move on then to [intervenes].    Just a final question in relation to that evidence.  In paragraph 41.13 you say you were interrupted this was when you were taking photographs by Ms Myeni who seemed very nervous?    And it continues to say “I thought it best to appease her and return the docket to her.”    Did you photograph all the documents that you were given or some, what was the case?    Do you know whether Ms Myeni was aware that you had taken photographs?    Notwithstanding the fact that she interrupted you in that process or after that process?    So she did not walk over to you and stop you from doing what you were doing?    If we can then go to paragraph 42 and there you deal with matters related to the former President Jacob Zuma.  Do you know from your own knowledge or what you were told how Mr Watson had been introduced to President Zuma?    Whose house was that?    Do not worry about that.    Then in paragraph 42.3 you talk about events relating to Ms Myeni once more.  Tell the Chair about that please?    Let us go on the paragraph 42.4.      Were you ever present at a meeting where the Bosasa prosecution or contemplated prosecution was discussed with Ms Myeni?    By this time I take it from your evidence President Zuma had been elected as President?    You talk of a particular meeting in paragraph 42.5.      Would you provide detail to the Chair please?    Alright.    Right with respect we – that is not an issue that concerns.    No I want detail please of the content of the meeting.    What did Gavin Watson say he had said at that meeting?    What was said at that meeting by Mr Watson to the former President?    According to what Mr Watson told you?    Was there a latter meeting between Mr Watson and Mr Mti at what you were present?    Did this meeting to which you will now refer happen after the meeting with the former President?    What was said at this latter meeting?    To whom did Gavin Watson say that?    Right.  Do you recall ever being present at a meeting when Mr Watson spoke over the telephone to President Zuma?    Who was at that meeting?    Just to go back a moment please to paragraph 42.5.  The second meeting referred to in that paragraph where Gavin Watson said to Mr Mti “please tell Ms Jiba that the President is waiting for her to make a move.”    It is the President that was waiting is it?    Do you know what position Ms Jiba held at that stage?    NDPP you mean National Director of Public Prosecutions?    If you would just bear with me a moment?  In paragraph 42.7 you say that any requests, because you have given this evidence before I am going to lead, any request forwarded on behalf of President Zuma would be granted by Gavin Watson.  Do you have an example of any such request?    Okay.    Did Mr Watson ever tell you of his own beliefs or attitude in regard to whether or not President Zuma would support or did support and protect him?    My question was somewhat different.  Let me ask it again.  Did Gavin Watson ever tell you what his belief was in regard to whether he had the support and protection of President Zuma?  Support and protection?    Mr Watson believed, he Mr Watson was bulletproof?    I am sorry?    I understand.  In the next paragraph you deal with certain other evidence of yours.  Kevin Wakeford what was his relationship with Gavin Watson?    Was there a stage at which Bosasa was being audited by the South African Revenue Services?    Was Mr Wakeford on occasion consulted by Gavin Watson in relation to negative press publicity and these SARS audits?    Alright, and was he paid a fee for his services?    Did Mr Wakeford approach Mr Watson on one occasion whilst Bosasa was undergoing a major SARS investigation?    What did he tell Mr Watson and were you present at that meeting?    What was said?    Alright, was Mr Wakeford paid a fee for his services in relation to this particular investigation and SARS investigations in general?    A fee?    For services rendered?    Then go on please to deal with the allegation in paragraph 43.5.  At that stage Mr Papadakis do you know whether he was in any way related in a business sense to the South African Revenue Services?    Or simply approach him.    Simply approach him, say we have this issue we wish to raise in relation to the investigation.  You are employed by SARS so we want to make representations to you.    Alright.  Carry on then, paragraph 43.5?    Alright.    Wet and dry or wet or dry?    Alright.    Do you know who owned that property in Meyersdal?    Do you know whether cement delivers were indeed made and, Chair, there will be further evidence in relation to those transactions.  Let us move on please to paragraph 44 where you talk of the Department of Home Affairs and certain renegotiations which took place in relation to the Lindele repatriation centres?    You say you went to the meeting where Mr Watson and Mr Wakeford would have discussed matters relating to the investigation of SARS with Mr Papadakis?    The evidence you can give you have already given?    Let us go then to paragraph 44, the Lindele repatriation centre.  You have told the, Chair, that that centre was a facility owned by the Bosasa groups.  You say here in the statement specifically by Bosasa Properties Pty Limited?    And you have told the, Chair, it is a facility for the detention and repatriation for migrants who enter the country without proper authority and documentation?    The management of Lindele under which department would that fall?    And the tender for the management of Lindele was granted you say by the Department of Home Affairs to a Bosasa company.  What company was that?    I that Leading Prospect Trading 111?    Pty Limited?    Was there a time when that contract was under review?    At the instance of the Department of Home Affairs?    Was there a consultancy employed for that review?    Is that the same Neil Rahakrishner that you spoke of earlier?    Alright, and the consultancy Fever Tree was appointed you say by the Department of Home Affairs?    What was the content of the review, in other words what was done pursuant to the review?  You refer to that in paragraph 44.2?    And in particular how would this reduction and cost be achieved?    Who was that consultant?    Was an agreement reached?    In relation to the request by the Department of Home Affairs to reduce costs?    Alright, and was there any payment involved?  Payment at the hands of Bosasa?    Informed by who?    That he, Rahakrishner was expecting a payment of R7-million?    Right.    Alright, let us just go back to paragraph 44.4.    Where you do say what you have just told the, Chair, that the contract was extended for a further five years.  Was there any tender process involved?    Any Treasury approval involved?    And you say more favourable terms were included in the extended contract, is that so?    Alright, what was the annual gross value to Bosasa or Bosasa subsidiary in relation to this contract?    At the time you were wondering why on earth pay Mr Rahakrishner R7-million when the contract price had actually been reduced.  Had you at that stage examined the extended contract in any detail?    So you were not aware of any more favourable contract terms at the stage you expressed your doubts?    Were the benefits of the extended contract to Bosasa and its subsidiary explained to you at a later stage?    Was the relationship between Bosasa and its subsidiary on the one hand and the Department of Home Affairs on the other the subject of public comment at this time?    The negotiation of a reduced price did this do anything mitigate public concern about the contract?    Was Mr Rahakrishner happy about the fact that he was not about to receive R7-million?    Alright, and in relation to the monthly payment what happened?    Did he submit monthly invoices?    And were these payments affected to your knowledge?    Did you at some stage stop responding to the invoices from Mr Rahakrishner?    Then on page 91 paragraph 45 you deal with further irregular payments.    What you call irregular payments?    What is not clear from the allegations in paragraph 45.1 to 45.6 is firstly whether these payments were made to the individuals you name for example in paragraph 45.1 and secondly whether those persons that you name were actually influential in the irregular granting of contracts.  So I would like you to be very careful please and bear in mind that when you name a person as you do here that there must be some link or reason for naming that person.    No, we cannot stop your evidence.  You are here and we will investigate the veracity of your evidence.    We will allow people who are named to respond.  The choice is yours.  I am just placing the red flag.    Who had a copy of it?    And was this before the tender was issued or after the tender was issued?    Before?    Yes?    R25-million per month?    Yes?    Sorry you talk of an extension, are you talking of an extension of the existing contract pending the award of the new tender?    Right, carry on please?    No, that is fine for the moment.  Paragraph 45.2 line 2 the name Segote[spelt] elsewhere in paragraph 45 it is spelled Sekgota[spelt] do you know which is the correct spelling?    45.3?    Sekgota[spelt].    That is the consistent spelling apart from 45.2.    Alright, let us go on then to paragraph 46.    Paragraph 46 you make a general allegation that will be the subject matter of further evidence.  Would you just summarise please the allegation in paragraph 46 for the, Chair?    Detail in regard to the beneficiaries of this practice will be given later in evidence?    By someone else?    You say the recipient of the benefit did not pay for it.  Did the state pay?    Well I am not asking you to extrapolate on.    To that extent.  The bill for the services    Was that paid by the state?    [Intervenes].    And how were these expenses catered for in the books of Bosasa?    So they were actually deducted from income in the tax returns?    Paragraph 47, you deal with the issue of Black Economic Empowerment in relation to the Bosasa Group of Companies.  Would you tell the Chair please briefly what you wish to say in that regard?    Right.  Let me just ask you two questions in that regard.    You say that the arrangements were complex.    And detailed.  Are you prepared to assist in any further investigation in that regard?    Alright.  Secondly and as a question a broad summary in the tender documents that were presented by Bosasa to various Government departments was the true BEE status of the Bosasa Group of Companies represented?    I want to move to a.    Chair I see there is a camera at the back.  I am not sure whether that has been accredited.    Or not.    Thank you Chair.  Can we move please Mr Agrizzi to your statement or affidavit page 40, at paragraph 48 page 93?    Do you recall a meeting in 2010?    Is that the correct date?    After your return from vacation you were requested or told to go to a meeting with the Watson Brothers at the Michelangelo Hotel.    What was happening at the time in relation to Bosasa?    What happened at the meeting?    At that time notwithstanding the negative press that Bosasa was receiving did visits to the Bosasa Office Park on the part of politicians and industry leaders continue?    Let us go on then to paragraph 49.  You there refer to matters relevant to the release of the Special Investigations Unit Report?    During 2009 was this a matter that was discussed internally at Bosasa?    Who goes on holiday?    Right.  Did you go on holiday?    And at that stage you say that Bosasa was receiving negative press publicity and there were investigations current?    Well did you speak to Mr Watson after he had suggested this holiday?    Well you, in paragraph 49.2 you say Gavin Watson insist, insisted    That he, van Tonder and yourself go on an overseas.    Trip together.  Right.    You explain in that paragraph the context in which that suggestion was made.  In other words what was happening to Bosasa at the time?    Right, you then say in the same paragraph   At this time?    What did you say to Mr Watson?    Sorry, firstly that is not what you say in your statement, but could you place that [intervenes].    I must say the witness has informed me he suffers from diabetes.    And at times it affects his blood sugar.  I make no.    Excuses on his behalf or anything he might say or not say, but he has expressed to me that he, he wants to tough it out as it were.  I am not sure that that is a good idea, but.    Maybe he can make up his mind.    Thank you Chair.    Mr Agrizzi we are at paragraph 49.2 of your statement and you have told the Chair of the first part of that paragraph.  Just take a minute to refresh your memory in relation to the last four lines.    Before you go on.  Please, what did Gavin Watson mean, it may be obvious, but let us put it on record.    By the words “take the fall”.    Before you go on I would like to ask you a question.    About that.  It is matter that the legal team may deal with.  It is certainly a matter that people who get to cross-examine you in due course may arise, but one of the issues is what was the reason you decided to come forward and give the evidence that you have given and I want to ask you is one of the reasons or possibly one of the reasons that you knew that Mr Watson was going to lay all the blame on you and make you take responsibility for everything that happened and you decided to pre-empt him by coming clean?    Well just let us deal with this reason for the moment.    You have given evidence regarding other reasons and we may deal with that at the conclusion of your evidence.    You say that evening after he had made the suggestion that you take the fall he had called you numerous times.    Apologised.  You accepted his apology.    If you wish.    I am satisfied for the moment unless you want to raise anything.    Right.  Let us go on then to paragraph 49.4.  The overseas trip that Gavin Watson had suggested did it take place?    Right and in relation to the relationship between Mr Watson on the one hand and yourself and Mr van Tonder on the other did, was this issue discussed?    Right.  You say at paragraph 49.3 if I can just go back, that the attorney of whom you spoken agreed with your concern about Gavin Watson’s suggestion that you take the fall for Bosasa.  Is that in fact correct?    Alright.  Let us go on then.  Very briefly what did Gavin Watson say to yourself and van Tonder in relation to the context within which you are operating at the moment, the forthcoming or contemplated prosecution?    And you say here if one went down what did he say would happen?    And what was Mr Watson’s attitude to whether matters were under control or otherwise?    Did you believe that?    49.7, you talk of the affect that the circumstances at the time were having on you.  Could you explain that to the Chair please?    So you say here in paragraph 49.7 that   And your own belief as to whether you should stick with Gavin Watson or you should leave Gavin Watson and the consequences of that.  You deal with that.    In paragraph 49.7    While you were in Paris on holiday did you receive information about the release of the SIU Report?    Well let us just; I do not want to go behind that meeting.  As a result of that meeting were certain people given certain responsibilities?    In relation to the proposed or contemplated prosecution?    What, who got what responsibilities?    Alright and then in paragraph 50.1 did Gavin Watson at this stage begin to say whether he was in fact involved in any irregularity or not?    What happened in August 2016?    Okay what was your state of health at this time?    The day after you had left Bosasa did you receive any telephone calls?    Did you accept a call after a period of two weeks?    From whom was this call?    Was that the conversation that you refer to in paragraph 51?    Tell the Chair about that please?    Just spell that please?    Just before you go on.  You have resigned you then for two weeks refused to take calls despite many calls being made to you on behalf of the Watson brothers amongst others.  You then receive a visit from Daniel or Cheeky Watson.    You have a conversation with him and he makes certain offers to you which would involve your return to Bosasa and you have just stipulated some of the terms and conditions of that return encapsulated in the offer by Cheeky Watson, correct?    No you do not.  You just…    Sorry I just want to ask you what was the approximate value of the offer that was made to you, do you know?    Well you may have been fighting for it you were doing the opposite though.  You were participating in the what you term political activities of the company?    Alright.  Let us just get back to this meeting with Cheeky Watson because it is not clear at least to me from your statement.  This meeting would have happened some time during August or shortly after the end of August 2016, is that correct?    Alright.  The meeting with Cheeky Watson was it a verbal offer involved in that meeting or did he present to you a written document to sign?    And you say you signed it for amongst other reasons the fact that Gavin Watson had apparently resolved to put an end to the old manner of operation of the Bosasa companies?    It was in addition from a monetary point of view an attractive offer?    Alright okay.  Did you return to Bosasa?    Pursuant to signature of this agreement?    Alright before you go on please.  In the beginning of your statement – I must just find the paragraph.  You refer to two agreements.  Do you recall that?    I just want to find it please.  Just bear with me.  Paragraph 6.28 on page 8.  You have told the Chair that on or about 25 August 2016 you entered into a settlement agreement which is Annexure B.    That secured your re-employment with the business for a period of ten years after you had resigned?    Is that the agreement you are referring to?    And you signed that at the instance of Cheeky Watson?    Page 8.  The agreement itself is Annexure B but the reference to the agreement is at page 8 of the statement at paragraph 6.28.    The actual agreement.    Chair is at page 116 to 135.    Subsequent to signing the agreement did you return to Bosasa?    Did you make any presentation pursuant to the agreement and your understanding of its terms?    How was this presentation received?    Wharton is a university in the United States so I understand spelt W-h-a-r-t-o-n?    You say your presentation was well received did that include Gavin Watson?    What happened subsequently in November 2016?    You were telling the Chair about and?    November 2016.    You were about to tell the Chair of what happened in November 2016?    We are at paragraph 51.4 of your statement.    What shareholding?    That was important to you, you told the Chair?    Thank you Chair.  Did Mr Watson that is Mr Gavin Watson respond to your demand for the transfer of shares or the registration in your name of the shares he promised?    Was anything said in your turnaround strategy and the presentation of that in the two sessions you have referred to a moment ago about a change in character of the manner in which the company did business and expressly about a cessation of corrupt activities?    Alright so you say as I understand it, it was not said expressly in your presentations it might have been implied?    A political?    Leave aside your belief as to what was going on in Gavin Watson’s mind that is something that will arise from an analysis of all the evidence and probabilities and further questioning.  If Mr Watson himself give evidence.  His response to your demand for shareholding as I understand it was it to refuse to pay you or just to fudge the issue and delay payment?    And that is the shareholding that you?    You say at a stage and I am referring to 51.5 – paragraph 51.5 of your affidavit.  You were requested by Gavin Watson to make a payment.    Do you – can you remember to whom this payment was to be made?    Well let us – let us just deal with your statement step by step.  How much was involved?    Again a cash payment?    In a security bag?    Why did you not just say look that is over we are not making these payments anymore?    Objectively speaking your acceptance of the money and presumably of the instruction and I will come to whether it was carried out.  There is an objective fact indicating that really nothing had changed at all?    23rd of?    No it cannot be – are you sure 23 December?    Alright.  We will come to your state of health at this stage because it is relevant on your statement and your version to a later decision you made and its timing.  Did you go on leave on the 15 December 2016?    Right.  Just one question before I ask the Chair to adjourn.  Somewhere in the public domain and I do not have the press article to hand is an allegation that you stole money from the company?  Could that allegation be related to the fate of this amount of R265 000,00 or not?    Alright perhaps that detail will emerge in due course.  A straight forward question I want to ask you in relation to this money, this amount of R265 000,00.  Did you keep it or did you return it?    Is this a convenient time.  Chair we are at page 98 and the statement concludes in about seven or eight pages.  If there are any matters that delay completion tomorrow may I suggest that we just sit until we finished tomorrow?    I will do my best to make sure it happens.    Yes tomorrow Chair because there are certain logistical matters that need to be dealt with.    Chair.    Obviously I am not entirely in control of proceedings as you know.    But we will finish let us start at ten o’clock.    Chair subject to one reservation we have an application set down for ten o’clock tomorrow.  It should not take very long.    Chair we will try and contact the legal representatives concerned.    To start early tomorrow, half past nine.  If that is not possible.    Then we start at ten.    But we will continue until the completion at least of this witness’ evidence and try and line up a further witness.    And I am leading that witness so I am not mad – madly keen on going until five on the 10th day of evidence but.    Well perhaps that is just as well Chair.    Can we adjourn tomorrow and we will notify you of the start time?    They do know about ten o’clock Chair and I understand one lawyer travels to get here so perhaps we should just settle on ten?  Perhaps we should just settle on ten o’clock.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Morning, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    Correct.    Thank you.    That is correct, Chair.    Yes, Chair.    Chair, originally what would happen was I was approached by Papa Leshabane and he requested that he be given a provisional amount of R71 000.  Within the R71 000 was an amount stipulated for Lendele people.  Apparently he had people inside Lendele who needed to be sorted out.  There was R11 000 specifically attributed to other informants that he had all over the place, but I know of R30 000 that was attributed to journalists and through my interaction over the last 18 years well 17 years with Papa, alright, I always ask questions and I asked him for the names. Now I do not have the full names except for one or two people, but he provided them to me and those are the names I have got, and I will…[intervenes]    That is correct.    The named journalists appear in my black book, yes.    Those are pages from the book that fortunately I had.    No, no, sorry, Chair, it is the black book.    That is correct, Chair.    Papa.    Papa Leshabane, Joe knows, meaning the amount that I would give him for the journalists and then underneath and next to it is R30 000.  Underneath it is Zach Modise R1-million, Home Affairs R15 000.  Then there is Thandi Mokoko…[intervenes]    Okay.    Correct.    There are references, Chair, I have just not gone through that.  I did not know that question would be asked.    At the time Bosasa had been going through a very rough patch in terms of negative reporting from certain journalists and what happened was he had approached us and said he could arrange, he has some friends who are related to people and friends that he knows that have got the ability to swing the journalistic view points on Bosasa and will also be writing positive stories on Bosasa.    That is correct.    Well the other purpose was to get information from the press if there is a budding story or negative story that is about to happen and how to counteract it.    2012 around there they already started if I recall correctly.    Yes, he did.    Yes, he did, Chair.    What names did he give you?    The one name that he gave me was Ntuli apparently working for The Times or The Star newspaper.  The other one was a lady at the time that he was working very closely with called Pinky Khoabane and there was somebody that worked now in the Eastern Cape that helped him with a…[indistinct] or a prison story and the person, he just referred to him as Bongs.    That is what I have.    Ntuli?    N.    Ntuli[spelt].    I do not know.    He just, he was always, you know evasive on giving me the full names.  The best person to ask would be him.    But it was Ntuli, I remember Khoabane very well.    Pinky[spelt].    Koabane[spelt]    Bongs and this Bongs and this Pinky lady worked together very closely.    I cannot confirm it, Chair.  I just want to add something, Chair.  There was another person, but that was employed on a strategic level called Benedicta Dube.    I do not know, she was being dealt with by Papa Leshabane, I do not know.  I know that at one stage we paid well over R1-million for services.    Yes.    Yes, they did.    Well there were two people specifically as consultants.  It was this Benedicta Dube and I cannot recall her company′s name, and there was a gentleman by the name of Stephen Laufer that was employed as a consultant as well.    Stephen Laufer[spelt].    It was to get rid of negative publicity and also to discredit the journalists that were writing that type of articles.    There was an in depth report done on various journalists as well as a spider gram which showed their linkups to the Stellenbosch crowd.  One of the journalists was Basson, the other one was du Plessis and then there was basically just a campaign to discredit them.    That is correct.    Well threats if anybody comes up against Bosasa they would be threatened.  Chair, you must remember there is endless money in that vault so money would be used.  They would buy burner phones, they would, I mean I am talking now 30/40 burner phones each.    It is basically a phone that is not Rica′d and can be destroyed.    That is correct.    What happens is they would purchase these phones from, I do not know exactly where, but from the market or China Mall, I do not know where they would find them, but they would then issue them out to the person like Benedicta Dube or to somebody else and just ask them, give them the journalist number, restrict the numbers only to that journalist and let them phone them all hours of the night and day and threaten them or just phone them and constantly harass them.    I recall getting a phone call.  I was directly involved with it at all, but I recall getting a phone call from Mrs Ferial Haffajee about the attacks on Adriaan Basson.    Chair, it continuously happened, every month.    I do not know…[intervenes]    Chair, I cannot say.    I was told.    I was told by Papa Leshabane.    In front of numerous people that he was paying these journalists.    Chair, I was never present with any journalist, with the exception of Benedicta Dube and Stephen Laufer where I witnessed what they were doing.  The rest I do not know of.  I am going on what Papa Leshabane told me.    I cannot confirm that.    Yes.    That is correct.    And I recall, Chair, on a few occasions asking him how come the journalists are not writing positive stories for us?  And he would say no, no, no they make sure that there is no negativity coming out, and look there has been no negativity and that was his answer to me.    There were one or two good stories written by those journalists.    I cannot recall which ones.    Chair, I will have to do research into it and get research done.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair if I can answer you in detail?  The same journalist published an article on the journalist eight being given the donation [intervenes].    That is the SABC eight.  They based on one piece of paper which was sent to them by someone in Bosasa.  It is not even an authenticated email.  As a matter of fact I then asked the editor personally why Mr Fuzile who wrote the article did not contact me.  Mr Fuzile’s argument was that he did try and contact me on my cell phone.  I asked what the number was, because Mr Siqoko from the Times has it.  Mr Siqoko gave me the number as an old number.  I said but that is not my number.  This is after Mr Fuzile had said that he had contacted me a few times.  Mr Fuzile then continued to then phone my son and find out if I had moved out of my house.    Sure.    Okay.    Hm.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    Chair, I requested that I be asked any questions especially by the Times because of the history in writing.  I never received any questions from Mr Fuzile or answered any questions to Mr Fuzile.  He just phoned my son and my daughter-in-law is as we speak having a baby.  That is what happened.    No.    Chair when I embarked on this process I contacted Mr Frank Dutton and I explained everything to him.  I said to him that I will be going to Italy and I will be doing my annual fishing trip and you know Chair I think one thing that we must under, we must understand is that you know I have gone through a lot of effort, a lot of money to come here to try and make a difference in our country.  Yes, I know I have done wrong.  I do not want the glory.  I am not an angel by any means, but I have come with an open heart, with a clean heart to try and help where I can and then you get stories like this that are manufactured that ruin people’s lives.  I think it is disgusting.    Chair I have taken my house off the market.  The reason I am moving is only because it is myself and my wife alone.  We have bought another townhouse much smaller that we are moving into.  Unfortunately because I have not had time, I have not been able, I mean I am under protection and I am staying in a remote hotel.  I have not had time to actually move in.  Now you know Chair I just want to raise an issue if I may?    It is very easy to hide behind one’s sources and they remain anonymous.  Chair I think one needs to just get a message I do not know.  Sorry, Chair rather leave it.  Excuse me.    That is it.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.    Sorry, Chair.  Can I, can I just; I know this might not be regular, but can I just add one more thing?    In terms of this article.    You know Chair they said clothes were moved and the red cars are out already.  You know that the same people who promulgated this published my address all over the web.  Do you blame me for moving house?  As a matter of fact Chair the memorabilia, I would like to put it to mister, to the press; that memorabilia and if anybody bothered to check these cars were used to transport kids with cancer.  To give them a final dream.  That is actually what happened and they are welcome to phone, welcome to phone the people from the Cancer Association.    [Intervenes] and all that.  Sorry, Chair and the memorabilia was actually sold and the money was donated.    The reason being because I downscaled.    If somebody had bothered asking that question.    I would have told them the truth.    Sorry, Chair.    Chair I live in a hotel.  I have got to drive in and out every day to have the washing done by the, by the maids, because my wife also has to live with me now.  We have been, for two weeks we have been under this protective custody.  I cannot even see my grandkids.  My daughter is get, my granddaughter is getting born today and thanks to people who go and publish things that are wrong I cannot even be there.    Yes, I do.    That is correct Chair.  I was tasked by Gavin Watson to ensure that Mansell was paid timeously and I had to take over the role of taking care of Mr Gillingham’s meetings and attending once or twice a month to a lunch with Mr Gillingham to keep him under control.    The arrangement was that Danny Mansell would issue invoices and these I was told to make sure were paid timeously Chair.  Gavin did not want any issues with regards to Mansell.  He wanted him paid.  That was the agreement and he wanted to make sure that they get paid monthly.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair no work was done.  It was fictitious.    That is correct and forex implications as well.    No Chair.  What happened was he was fictitiously employed, but he would get the bribe cash every month to the value of R110 000.    That is correct.    It is correct to an extent, but the company that was employing him was a company called BEE Foods which was owned by Gavin Watson’s brother and sister-in-law.    Absolutely nothing.    So what would happen Chair is that there was discounts you know rebates structures in place and at the end of the month normally we deduct 20 percent from the invoice.  In the case of BEE Foods we would only deduct say 13, sorry 13.5 percent and the 6.5 percent would cover the costs of his R65 000 salary and the brand new Mercedes whatever.    Initially it was done by Danny Mansell and then I took it over.  That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair as a company we used Peet Venter from at that stage an accounting firm would do both Mti and Gillingham’s tax as well as all the tax of all the directors, but in specifically the case with Mti and Gillingham he would also make the payment in terms of the tax.  So if they were over taxed or under taxed at least and they needed to contribute to SARS Peet Venter would make the contribution via one of his companies which would then be reimbursed by Bosasa.    In terms of the individual returns or in terms of the group of companies?    That is correct.    No, I do not know of any instruction off the top of my head.  I would have to go through Mr Venter’s affidavit.    In detail.    Chair I need to think about that, because I need to actually; I, I did not expect the question.  I need to think through it.    We can come back to that.    Correct.    Chair right in the initial stages when I had to, when I was instructed I have got to take over from where Gillingham, where Mansell had left off with Gillingham.  I basically would have to and the instruction was you got to pay him R47 500 in cash, because that apparently was equivalent to what his net earnings were with the department.  So why that was there amount I do not know, but the idea was that that this money would be delivered to him on a monthly basis and I would also have to deal with if there was something wrong with his house.  You know if he needed the plumbers out or he needed the pool fixed or something like that.  Then that would be dealt with as well.  Does that answer the question?    To my knowledge payments continued and even subsequent to 2016 they continued, December.    That is correct Chair.    Chair basically an incident occurred where Mr Joe Gumede and I walked into one of the vaults and there was cash and lists lying all around in Jacques van Zyl’s walk-in vault/safe.  Gumede then went and spoke to Gavin Watson and said he was concerned about it and at that time already I was having issues.  I would always have to be the buffer between Gavin Watson and people.  So that specific time he was already doubting Jacques van Zyl’s loyalty.  You know, so it was a problem.    Ja.  The instruction Chair was that Andries van Tonder and I must take over the cash duties from Jacques van Zyl and I had to now manage this and control it better than it was controlled before and Jacques van Zyl, but he was still involved.  I mean we kept him there to create false invoices and that.  He was good at that.  So we left him to arrange the cash and that.    No.    No.  Chair I refused to handle cash alone for two reasons.  Number one is that I cannot trust myself sometimes, because if you give people cash it is like sweets with a kid.  People will get tempted.  So I always make sure there are two people who handle it together.    The other person was Andries van Tonder and if, let us say Andries was not there then I would call in Jacques van Zyl to come stand with me and count or even the secretary, Company Secretary, but I would make sure there are two people involved.    That is correct Chair and the reason why the black book was introduced was so that we can just keep record of, one never needs to be found wanting, you know.  You cannot answer for, for things.  The intention was never to keep a record for this type of environment.  The intention was if Gavin asked but where is this where is that where is that we could tell him and it was in writing.    Chair my dates, I cannot verify the dates, but it looks.    to me it like it was 2013.  It might even have been 2012.    I need to.    I think, I think Chair if I can just add.  You know the thing is we had so many little black books and you would swap them out.  As you use one you put one in, bring it back and forwards.    That is what happened.  So.    This is one of maybe three or four.    You know.    That is correct Chair.    Strange enough that is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is the only one I have.  I have got empty ones, but not one.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    They are Chair.  They are copies.    That is correct.    Chair I can only presume that it is between four and R6 million per month.    Maybe the [intervenes].    I can only say, sorry.  I can only say it is approximately between four and R6 million.  I do not have all the records.    I used the wrong word Chair.    Correct.    People I would deliver cash to and they would distribute it.  So in other words they would place an order.  I would then distribute it according to those names.  It was Ishmael Dikane.  He is one of the Directors.  Syvion Dlamini, one of the Directors.  Joe Gumede, the Chairman of Bosasa.  Sesinyi Seopela who was the consultant.  Richmond Mti, Thandi Makoko, Syvion Dlamini and myself.    Papa Leshabane and I cannot remember who I have mentioned.  So it was Ishmael Dikane, Joe Gumede, Sesinyi Seopela, Richmond Mti, Thandi Makoko, Papa Leshabane, Syvion Dlamini.  I have got Gillingham here and that is an error, because he gave him money but I did not, you know, use him to distribute money.    Yes.    No, he did not distribute it. Sorry, I personally delivered to Gillingham and maybe that it is; I just want to check that is why Gillingham is there, because it says I delivered to.  So this why it is there.  It is correct.    Correct Chair.    That is to the best of my knowledge.    That is correct Chair.    Gillingham and Mti.    That is correct Chair.    Chair the contract awarded to us at that stage, I must say us, Sondolo was for about R601 million.  It was for the implementation of the security access control system, scanning system as well as cameras with ITD control, control sites and control rooms for close on about 110 courts nationally.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    This was done on a national basis.  It was managed by the IDT who was subcontracted to the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and the agreement was that Sondolo IT would pay 2.5 percent call it lobbying fees or bribes to certain of the individuals in the Department of Correctional Services, sorry Justice and Constitutional Development and there was a spreadsheet and as money came in 2.5 percent of that money would be drawn in cash and handed over.    Yes he did Chair.    I think Chair as well I make it very clear in my affidavit that I did not have direct evidence of the secretary.    They were similar, Chair, but what was happening was that costs would be filtered through those contracts into other entities where it facilitated dividends being taken out, let us put it that way, the nice way.  Dividends were taken out by another entity.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    Yes, you did.    I have done it.    Yes.    Chair, I just want to add that I do not have my computer since I left.    But I know that they have a contract list.    I think perhaps maybe through the legal team they can just request a full list of contracts.    There is a data base that we created.    That would actually be more accurate than my memory.    Yes.    Yes, would the, Chair, also require subsidiary companies for instance Sun Works Solar is one of their companies.    Within the group, all those?    Shareholding.    Then I will include Sun Works.    Yes, Chair.    Well I bumped into Ms Dudu Myeni, it was informal.  I had walked into the Sheraton Hotel for another meeting and it was just an informal introduction.  I was with Gavin Watson coincidentally at the time.  But there was no formal meeting or anything, I was just really introduced to her.    Gavin was quite open, Gavin Watson would tell us that he is paying her R300 000 a month and he was – he always said that he hopes that she is giving it to Zuma and the payment was for the foundation apparently.    For the Jacob Zuma Foundation.    She was at the SAA, are you talking in respect of…[intervenes]    I think she was the Chairperson of the foundation.    Correct.    Well it was for the foundation, Chair.  So maybe my, I did not express it properly.  It was for the Jacob Zuma Foundation.    That is what I was told, Chair.    Well the strange thing is it was always cash.    The payment was made to Dudu Myeni.    Always.    Chair, because on occasion I would have to arrange to pack the money, even though I was not delivering the money, but I would have to pack the money in this regard.    Yes, I was, Chair.    Chair, I remember the time at the Sheraton and I cannot recall the dates of the other times, but they were within a year of each other, it was a few times.    That is a good question.  I think I refer to it in my actual statement where I got documentation, so I just want to have a look quickly, because I have so much running on in my head at the moment.  Chair, I cannot recall the year at the moment.  I think it was in the region of 2013/2012, it will come up in the statement later on.    No, there were a few occasions, Chair.    Yes.    No, I was merely present when it happened.    On two of the occasions it was Gavin Watson, on one occasion it was Mr Trevor Mathenjwa.    That is correct.    Chair, I cannot recall if it was two or three times or if it was only twice really.    But at the offices, at our offices she would actually come through for a visit and a discussion with Watson and I know that there was – I mean I saw her there once or twice or two or three times at least.  I cannot remember exactly how many times at the office.    Correct.    Chair, one morning, it was early in the morning at about 05   To Dudu Myeni.    Well, because quite simply I was there.  I knew what was happening and then Dudu Myeni afterwards actually thanked me personally for choosing the right bag for her.    Yes.    Okay.    That is correct.    Well someone collected it and brought it to Bosasa.    That is correct.    I saw it.    Gavin Watson, Chair.    It was delivered to Dudu Myeni.    Because afterwards she came to – when I saw her again she actually thanked me for the bag, because she felt that it was a nice bag, you know, it made a statement for her.    That is correct, Chair.    Chair, can I clarify one thing, because I just want to clarify, because certain reports has reported certain things.    And they are busy tweeting probably as we speak and I just want to clarify my wife never bought a bag.  Someone else went and collected the bag and paid for it.    Okay.    Definitely not my wife and she did not put money in the bag.    Okay.    He said she was over the moon, she was very, very happy with the bag.    I am trying to recall now.  No, not – I cannot recall exactly what was said right now.    They were monthly payments.    There were R300 000 per month.    Because on a monthly basis I would have to draw accordingly for Mr Watson.    You must remember that certain of the payments on the high profile people, they might appear on my list maybe once or twice, but normally they would be done by Mr Watson himself and he did not like to keep record, he always said that he has never signed anything or written anything down on a piece of paper, because he could get caught out.    I will check it.    Most definitely.  There were times when she would call on Gavin Watson to arrange functions, high end functions, expensive functions for Jacob Zuma and then there were times when she needed stuff done at her house in terms of security and that and all that was arranged.  We did not bother asking questions or getting approvals, we just went ahead and did it.    Well let me give you an example if I may, Chair?    We had a meeting at one stage we were working with a company called Falcon Oil and Gas in terms of the fracking transaction in the Northern Cape.  Now Falcon Oil and Gas owned the portion below the one that is owned below the one that is owned by BP and the rest.  We needed legislation changed, number one.  Number two is we needed the buy-in of Chevron and I give an example where Chevron had arranged with Standard to conduct interviews on potential partners at their offices.  We were the only company that could refuse to do that and insist that they meet at our offices.  She was instrumental in that type of thing, because people realised that she was very close to the President and she could really call the shots. So I that instance it was beneficial having her there.    So she was powerful or is powerful.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is one of the letters I happened to have which were thank you letters from the foundation for a birthday party that was arranged for at that stage it was President Zuma.    Correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    Well the letter is a letter of appreciation and I will try read it for the birthday celebration.    That is correct.    And what it does say is   Patrons.    Then I think Mr, perhaps…[intervenes]    Okay, let me see what I see, what my eyes see.    Alright. "On behalf of the patron of the Jacob Zuma foundation his Excellency the President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr Jacob G Zuma, may we take this opportunity to thank you for the splendid birthday dinner catered for at short notice.  The family was thrilled to have a…″ That I cannot read.    Oh, I have got it now. "Remarkable time with their father.″    "The family was thrilled to have a remarkable time with their father intimately enjoying the wonderful dinner prepared.″ I cannot read the rest.    "With care.  The chef′s creativity and professionalism was commended by everybody.″ I presume that is what it reads.  The rest I cannot make out.    Okay, sorry.  I think Mr Pretorius′ eyes are much better than mine.    That is correct.    Yes, Chair, I remember it quite vividly.  So Bosasa had been approached by a gentleman by the name of Neil Rahakrishna to become involved with the Karoo fracking transaction with the company called Falcon Oil and Gas.    All the costs of all the functions was in the region of about R3.5-million.    Chair, that was the last calculation that I did where I worked out for a year, worked out to about R3.5-million.    Yes, I am sure that the company would have the records still.    Because I know – how I know, Chair, is because that claim went through and I signed it off and it was allocated to CSI.    So I recall the number pretty vividly.    So I was approached on the fracking transaction, because I had known a Neil Ramakrishna, we worked together on the Home Affairs issue.  In terms of Falcon Oil and Gas I was introduced to Phillip O′Quigley who is the International Chairman of the group…[intervenes]    Phillip O′Quigley[spelt].    And that expressed an interest to an attorney who is a neighbour and a friend to Mr Ramakrishna whose name is Lizel Oberholzer[spelt] and basically they brought the opportunity to Bosasa.  He came and spoke to me about it and we looked at the opportunity and what Falcon Oil and Gas was looking for was a facilities management company that would handle all the security, access control, the guarding and assist them with operational management as well.  So it was an ideal fit. At that stage as well knew that the reason why they brought the transaction to us was because Gavin had a close relationship with Dudu Myeni and obviously there would be influence from the President there.    Myeni′s influence over the President.  That was a critical point for us as well and I alluded to it earlier where we had the meeting with Chevron and with Standard that we could actually demand that they appear at our offices instead of following the normal and regulations.  So there was also in terms of the…[intervenes]    Well the original arrangement with Chevron and Standard was that if you wanted to be part of them you had to apply for an interview and you would have to appear for an interview at their offices.    By meeting a leading businessman like Patrice Motsepe, Saki Macozoma they would have to go there to their offices.  In our case it was a bit different, because we had Dudu Myeni on our side everybody knew that we yielded the whip and Chevron had to comply by coming through to our offices.    Correct.    Sorry.  So one of the major issues that the whole fracking transaction had was some of the restrictions in terms of the legalities that needed to be resolved.  So certain amendments to the actual regulation were required and the best person to do that would be the President and that is why we made sure that we remained very close to Dudu Myeni.  It transpired that what actually happened Chair was that Dudu Myeni coordinated the meeting at Nkandla between Gavin Watson, Philip O’Quigley and Lizel Oberholzer.  So at that specific meeting the intervention of the President was required to make sure that he could persuade the, and advise the Minister of Minerals and Energy to basically effect the legislative changes that the oil and gas industry required and I think everybody knows that there were certain changes made to the legislation as well.  So subsequently to the meeting.    I think it was Mr Michael Ramatlhodi.    Chair I will have to get back to you on that.    Alright.  So what had actually happened was that the meeting with the President was extremely successful and subsequently the Ministers advisors, legal advisors, were then instructed to meet with Oberholzer and to make amendments were necessary to the regulations.    No, I did not.    Chair I have got three independent reports.  One was.    From Watson.    One was from Aniel Krishna.    And the other one was from Lizel Oberholzer.    And they all were exactly the same.    Right.    So it is suffice to say that Bosasa was favoured by the President and he made that statement as well when he had met with Lizel and with Aniel.  So that they knew exactly where they stood and then.    Pursuant to that merely would organise the.    Yes.    As far as I know they were Chair.    That is correct.  I do not know.    [Intervenes].    I do not know.  I, I say that they might be, but I do not actually know, because I am not a legal person.  I do not know.  I know, I know for a fact that they were proposed I am not 100 percent sure if they were effected.    Chair as far as, as far as I know the investigative team were going to contact Ms Oberholzer to find out.    I, I am not a legal.    Specialist.    Thereafter there would be numerous meetings coordinated at the Nkandla residence and on one such occasion I remember Gavin Watson was concerned that the President was not getting the, the necessary envelope so to speak.  You know, the R300 000.  So I remember him telling me that we have to pack it and he was going to deliver directly to the President and make sure that he has been getting it from me and himself.    Chair there are a couple of glaring questions that I had at the time.  Surely through a foundation you would do an EFT.  One can call a bribe by many a word and sweeten it up and sugar coat it.  Maybe it was for a foundation, but why would you want it in cash?    Chair those; he told me exactly what happened.  We had a relationship where he would tell me absolutely everything.    He said it went; he said he personally delivered it to Jacob Zuma, put the bag next to him and said, and asked him the question does Dudu give you your money every month and the answer was yes.    That is correct.    Chair I do not think the foundation ever got any money.    I think it went straight.    To maybe you know.  I cannot assume.    I can only ask the questions I asked myself.    Why is it in cash?    Why does it have to be hand delivered?    And he said yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Mr Gumede.    They phoned me from the actual meeting and then the following Monday morning we discussed in our meeting as well.    Well we were basically told that Gavin Watson gave the bag of R300 000 cash to Jacob Zuma and then asked him if he had been getting the regular from Dudu Myeni and the answer was yes.    My understanding Chair is that it was Mr Zuma, Joe Gumede and Gavin Watson at the meeting and Gavin wanted to make sure that Dudu Myeni was not taking a haircut of the money.  As simple as that.    My understanding.    My understanding was that it was, was what it was.    Yes, it is the same meeting Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair basically the meeting took place and I, if I am not mistaken I think it was actually after a birthday party and he, he was on his way to Russia that he made time to see them at Nkandla.  Now while he was at this meeting one of the big issues and the big concerns raised was this whole investigation with the Hawks, because it seemed to be starting to brew up again.  So they needed to get clarity and finality on this and at that meeting it is when they raised the issue with the President and the President at that time and he said listen let me just make a call or two.  So I am giving it to you from memory now.  I am not reading off my notes.    But he said let me make a call or two and he made the calls, because it is further mentioned in a recording that was done afterwards where he actually made a call to the Hawks and that is basically what took place at that actual meeting there.    Well he said at this meeting he agreed to make the calls.  So the President said he would make the calls and Gumede then confirmed that to me that he said he would make the calls and apparently he made the calls and that is why the Hawks then got hold of Gumede and arranged a meeting with them.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair, because [intervenes].    I just want to, I just want to mention something that might clarify it.  Is that the; Joe Gumede actually says in, in one of the discussions that he, he did indeed make the call to the Hawks meaning President Zuma, because the Hawks then came and approached Joe Gumede.  That is what I am saying.    Well you could refer to it as that, but why else would they phone?    Sure.    Yes.    Chair I can tell you what I was told.  That is all I can do and that is what I was told.    That is correct Chair.    Possibly.    I did.    It was, it was more or less at the same time that the; that was the birthday party I think of Mr Zuma.  Does that answer your question?    [Intervenes].    No.    There were so many.  Chair I, I will have to come back to you.    I cannot remember exactly which birthday party it was.    That is correct Chair.    No, I cannot.    I cannot remember the date.    Oh yes.    Then it would be 2016.  Thank you.    That would have been probably a little bit later.  I would say May/June 2016.    Yes, sir.    If I am, if I remember correctly my wife actually phoned up a lady.  I need to find, I can find out who the lady was and she mentioned that another lady will be coming to pick it up.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    My wife placed the order.  She sent some pictures that she got from the lady at Louis Vuitton and based on that she said this is the brand number, this is the model number and another lady went in to go and pay for the bag and pick up the bag and deliver it to Mr Watson.    That is correct.    One afternoon Chair I cannot remember the exact date, but Gavin Watson asked me to attend a meeting with him with Ms Myeni.  He told me that he had very, she had very important documentation to actually show us and it was critical that I be at that meeting.  I remember it vividly because I had a meeting scheduled with a client and I had to cancel that meeting with the client and I need, needed to rush through with him and I actually; what happened was we drove together.  We actually drove in his car and when we got there we were told, we were escorted up to a certain floor.    Yes.  Money was prepared.    It was R300 000.    That is correct.    We went to the Sheraton Hotel in Pretoria opposite the Union Buildings.  I think that is the only one there is in Pretoria.    When we arrived at the hotel Chair we were taken, escorted up to a, I think it was the fifth or the sixth floor of the Sheraton Hotel.  It is like a lounge area for VIP guests.    Chair I think it was the sixth floor.  I can explain it to you.  You walk in through the; you come out of the elevators and there is concierge desk in front of you.  It is very well fitted out and that.  We turned left and she was sitting in the corner on a couch and we went to her there and sat there.  It was a private corner with glass all around it and we could see.    Well the meet, the meeting that was attended was with Gavin Watson and myself and Dudu Myeni.    Yes.  She explained to us that she had meetings at the NPA and they were long tedious meetings she told us and she said that they were working on closing down and shutting down the case and she said, but I want you to look at the docket and she gave me the docket and she said alright fine.  You can write down things, but please do not make copies or take photographs of anything like that.    The; she was working on getting the Bosasa matter closed down.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    She said it was a police case docket and it looked like a police case docket.  So, but what she did not, what she did do was she took some notes out of it which seemed separate.  So she had the actual, it was a beige folder but, quite a thick folder, but she took then some notes out of it and said I must look at these notes.    Yes.  I asked actually to be excused from there for two reasons.  Number one I needed some quiet around me to understand what was written down and I wanted to rewrite the notes, but in the back of my mind I knew that it was too extensive to write down everything.  So I thought well you know what harm is it going to do to take a few photographs.    Sorry, could you repeat that question to me please?    Yes.    No, she was very specific.  She said that it is very, very secret these documents and nobody must know that she has shown them to me and she did not want me to make copies of it.  I could write down, transcribe everything that was on it, but it was quite a lot of documents and I did not have the luxury of, you know, time.    Well I wrote down quite a bit in my, in the back of my, one of my journals on some specific aspects, but as time was running and I could see from, from where she was sitting and the reflection in the, in the glass that she was very fidgety and very nervous.  So I thought let me rather make photo, photographs of the documents so that if she comes to take it away at least I have got something to work off.    Yes, I did.  I put the, the papers down and then I took photographs from them.    I think it was on the floor or on the couch.  You know, next to me.  So I, so I could get both hands to take the photograph.    Could you repeat the page again please?    It is the photographs I took.    That is correct.    They appear to be, you know, a report progress on the investigation.    I just want to add Chair if you look at because [intervenes).    Specifically Chair was asked that she goes to the President and gets it closed up immediately.    Correct.    I believe it was Anwa Dramat.    I really do not know.    A function for 250 people on Sunday morning for a birthday party.    It would always come through Ms Myeni most of the times.    Yes, he told me in no uncertain terms we used to have every morning meeting was plaqued by renditions of what a brilliant President he was and how phenomenal he was and he always praised him.  So he had a very good repore with him.  He used to specifically say that he could sit across him by a table, he had actually gesture by moving his chair and come and sit right in front of me and says I speak to him like this.    Most definitely.  He believed that he was totally bulletproof.    With Mr Zuma yes.    With Mr Zuma on his side, yes.    Well they are longstanding friends of the Watsons.    Most definitely, we were being constantly hounded.  Every time there is a negative newspaper article we would at that stage be audited, pulled in, I mean even in our personal capacities, SARS used to come and do lifestyle audits on us, full audits and really pester us.    Yes, he was and on terms – on certain occasions he actually accompanied me to the bankers to try and explain the allegations away with the banks.    Yes, he was.    That is correct, Chair.    I was present at that meeting, Chair.    Well basically what was said is that we need to get George Papadakis on board and everything else we tried would be pointless.  We need to get him on board and get him to help us in sorting out the SARS issue.    Yes, he was paid a large sum of money every month.  It was in the region of about R100 000 a month.    Correct, yes.    That is correct.    Well he was a consultant there and that is why everybody thought it would be great to be able to use him to assist us.    Sorry?    Correct.    I was not privy to the meeting that was held, Chair, with Gavin Watson, Kevin Wakeford and George Papadakis.  All that we were told is that he is working in the background he will handle everything.    And then we basically would get an order to say that you need to deliver wet and dry cement.    Wet and dry.    Cement to a certain property in Meyersdal, but I think that Frans Vorster or the next witness will deal more thoroughly with that incident.    That was owned by Mr Papadakis.    That is correct.    I was not in the – I cannot recall being in the meeting with Mr Papadakis and Mr Wakeford and Mr Watson.    Yes.    That is correct, Chair.    Correct.    The management of the Lindele repatriation facility is done by Bosasa but falls under the department of Home Affairs.    It is called Leading Prospect Trading which is one of the subsidiaries.    That is correct.    Correct.    Yes.    That is correct, Chair.    Chair, the consultancy was Fever Tree Consultants and they had subcontracted part of that to a gentleman by the name of Neil Rahakrishner from Akile.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    The Minister at that stage was Nakula and she wanted to see, Lindele was always a hot potato in parliament and it will always be raised as it is costing the tax payer so much money.  So she wanted to raise the issue with us and she wanted the price reduced of Lindele itself.    What happened was we used to at Lindele be paid per person per day so you are paid per occupancy rates.  During the early 2000′s I negotiated a fixed fee rate, because it is like a bus of school kids, you either have a full bus of an empty bus, but you still have to pay for the bus.  So we negotiated a fixed fee contract where we did not charge per occupancy, but we charged specifically for a fixed fee.  So they wanted this reduced, because what was happening was where Lindele should be accommodating between 3/4000 people was only accommodating 1 000 and the department would be charged the fixed fee rate which was equivalent to 3 500 people so in their opinion it was wastage so she wanted it reduced.  So I then entered into discussions and negotiations with Fever Tree Consulting who then appointed a consultant to work with us on it to look at the reductions in it.    The consultant that was eventually appointed was Neil Rahakrishner and the reason why he was appointed was, because Gavin Watson and Kevin Wakeford decided we could work with him.  That is the first time I actually met Neil.    Yes.    Sorry, yes an agreement was reached and we reduced the costs.    At a later stage after they had reduced the cost, we reduced the cost by about R862 000 per month and my concern was that Neil Rahakishner approached me and said that him, Kevin Wakeford and Gavin Watson had come up with a deal.  So I said look I do not know about a deal, but let me find out and if there is a deal then there is a deal, but I was not involved with it.  I was then informed that he was expecting a payment of R7-million.    By Neil Rahakrishner.    Exactly.    And that was to facilitate the negotiation and the extension of the contract.  So if I can explain to you, Chair, what actually happened was, it was a process where we reduced the price by R860 000 so the saving to the department over the period of time was considerable.  However, what happened was the contract was extended by another five years. So it was extended by five years, so in actual fact we were scoring, but I did not see it that way so I approached Gavin Watson and I said to him, you know, Neil is very concerned and annoyed with me, because he says that you cut a deal with him.  My concern was also why I could not fathom out why he would agree to pay R7-million over just like that. Watson then said to me, he said to me in summary he said you are not paying R7-million you can pay him on a monthly basis.    Sure.    Nothing, whatsoever.    No.    Yes, that is true.    Chair, 96.3-million.    No, I had not.    No, I was doubtful of the transaction.  I had not seen yet what Neil Rahakrishner had put in to the actual contract.    Kevin Wakeford explained it to me later and he explained that what they had done was extended the term of the contract, but also made it more feasible in terms of increases as well.  So the actual increments that you would get would compound at the bottom and grow quicker.  So what might be worth 9-million now might be worth say R13-million, where if you started off with 10-million you would only be at 12-million at the same time. So to me it made sense and it seemed to work.    I mentioned it earlier.  It was continuously in the press and everybody was unhappy with the Bosasa contract.    I think to a large degree it helped.  It kept everybody quiet, Chair, and I think that people started realising that maybe Bosasa and Lindele is not a bad notion at all.    No, he was not happy at all, Chair.  I had all my days with that gentleman.    So I said to him well look I was not part of your transaction.  I did not debate anything with you and I said all I can do is go to Gavin Watson and say listen what about if he puts in a monthly invoice.    Yes, he did, but he did it through one of his friends who has got a wine merchant agency so I remember that it was Wine Merchants of something like that and we processed I think it was around R75 000 a month for him.    Yes they were and the chap who did that was the financial guy there Carlos.    Yes, it was about 2015 if I remember correctly, Chair, and we were under scrutiny by the banks, we were under scrutiny by the auditors so eventually I just stopped it and we could not actually in 2015 afford it as a company either, because there was major cash flow issues, so what we did was, I said to him look let me help you with an alternative until things come right and we did the rebranding of his company and all his graphic design and that instead of paying him on a monthly basis, because the company was really battling with cash flow at that stage.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well then, Chair, if it is the feeling of the team that maybe I should not name them then…[intervenes]    Yes.    Chair, I will give it to you as it happened.  So I was introduced a few years ago to the Treasury General of the Youth League Reggie Nkabinda, okay, he is also known as the commander or the general or something like that in the North, in the Krugersdorp area, but I was introduced to him by Gavin Watson who explained to me that he was very close to Nomvula Mokonyane and that I must see if we can assist him and I had to help him at one stage with our design studio, because we had a whole internal design and branding studio and basically what we needed to help him and see where we could assist develop his brand and his company. But I – they were a bit more influential than that.  So on one occasion I met Nkabinde with an associate with his by the name of Sam Sekgotla and I was aware that Reggie had relationships with various politicians, I knew he was very well connected, but more specifically with Tom Moyane.  I knew that.  I knew he was very close to Tom Moyane and he would be able to resolve any issues at Correctional Services.    Mr Nkabinde.    Correct sir.    Alright, it is not in my statement, but I learned this from Eric Mauritz who I was told to speak to in connection with getting close to Tom Moyane.  Remember we never actually had a relationship with Tom Moyane either, so it was concerning.  So in 2016 I was called into the boardroom at Bosasa and Gavin Watson was there and in the meeting was Gavin, Patrick Monyeki, Reggie Nkabinda and Sam Sekgotla and I was a bit surprised, because there was no other Directors in the meeting, just Gavin and I walked into the meeting and they said listen I think you better work with Sekgotla and Reggie if we want to retain the existing catering contract at the Correctional Services. So I was a bit shocked, because my understanding was we were on top of the issues and you know there is no need to work with anybody else, but evidently the tender had been leaked out and they had a copy of it.  I had not even seen a copy.    It was Reggie Nkabinde, their team, I cannot remember exactly who unless I made a note of it, but I was shown the tender document.    Before the tender was issued.    Alright, so it was concerning to me so we then started negotiating with them, because you must remember, Chair, that this contract would make between 20 and R25-million net a month so you had to look after it and the people that we thought were looking after it were not on top of their game.  They were fast asleep and they lost the opportunity and we nearly lost out in this contract now if you lose that contract that is 25-million down the drain. So we were very concerned about it.    Per month yes.    So what happened was the concern I had was that if somebody else had the upper hand then we will sit with a problem.  So myself and Gavin Watson had a chat and we then went back to them and said okay what do we do?  How do we sort this problem out and Sekgotla basically said well listen I have got a company, you pay me R5-million into my company and we will get you an extension, which then would give us time to work out a plan of sorts on how to manage this thing. So we paid, we got the extension I think it was the next day and we paid a R5- million consultancy fee.  An invoice was raised from their consultancy company and then we raised the second agreement.    It was a six month extension.    So six months, Chair, was the extension and in all fairness R5-million for six months, six months is equivalent to R150-million when you are paying R5-million for that so we paid the money.  It was transferred the next day.  Then we did a second agreement with Sekgota and that was for the renewal of the catering contract, but this agreement required the payment of R10-million to Sekgota′s company, but Gavin refused to pay that amount.  He said no he is not going to pay that much the people that were working for us, who slipped up the first time would not slip up the second time.  They would get it right. So Sekgota did not bother getting a renewal for the catering contract and what happened was that we lost at that stage I think it is about 40% of the catering contract.  Does that explain it in detail?    I actually do think 45.3 is the correct spelling.    I think that is.    I am sure.    I am not sure.    Yes.    That is exactly what I am saying, Chair.    He agreed, we drafted the agreements, when it came to signing the agreement he pulled out at the last minute.    Because he took advice from people who said that he does not need to pay that kind of money for that agreement.    I think they are more than allegations, I think they are factual.  So on a regular basis Bosasa had a team set aside to do this and this team would provide full security solutions across the board.  They were called a special installations team, they had their own vehicles, they had their own stock and they would go around from house to house, actually putting in CCV systems, but not only that but sorting out electric fences, electrified gate.  Everything from your pool pump right the way through.  So this team Special Projects would not charge the person, but they would get instructions from myself or I would take instructions from Gavin Watson and send it out to them and they would go and do the work.  So basically this team.    Chair I think there were about eight people in the team.    Correct, ja.    Okay.  So this team would do absolutely anything and could fix anything.  From a pond to a broken doorbell, but what is more important is that they would send from site to site to do installations, maintenance, follow ups, client customer care.  Sorry, but this was done at no cost to the recipient.    So as, as a Minister you would get if you needed your house fitted out with CCTV and maybe a movie theatre system.  You pick up a phone, phone Bosasa.  They will send somebody over.  You do not need to worry about paying for it.    But that debt remains forever.    So.    That is.    That is what was offered.    Correct.    Yes that is correct.    Well indirectly yes the state is paying, because if you are paying for bribery money that is what I am.    No the state never [intervenes].    No, no.    No it was not.    If there are invoices they have been backdated and sent.  There was never an invoice sent.    Just the operational costs.    That is correct Chair.    Chair if I [intervenes].    If I remember correctly it was from 2013 and they were actually a Special Projects Team that I would use to go and do special projects, but then it just evolved and.    People could use it and they, they started to abuse it.    It was for a short period of time then they dismissed everybody out of the team and reemployed new people in the team and the reason for that is they were concerned that the old people would uncover or unfold what was happening there and whose houses were being monitored that type of thing.    Chair basically what has happened is BEE in South Africa is not being truly represented by many companies and we all guilty of it, but most importantly or most concerning was that if you set up a complex network of subsidiaries and various entities and trusts and you make it very complicated.  The identification of the true BEE of a company is virtually impossible and this is what has been happening.  I am not, I am not saying it was only endemic to Bosasa.  What I am saying is I know how it was done and basically you know that to move from a premise of where you were at BEE Level 4 to a BEE Level 2 or one unless you have the right credentials you cannot be there, but now what was happening was there was manufactured credentials.  So I would manufacture a credential by putting somebody in that place giving them the shares, giving them full autonomy, shareholding but at the same time having an agreement on the side which basically said you do not own the shares until such time as you pay for them and maybe there is nothing illegal with that, but then surely you cannot rate yourself as BEE if you still have, yield, hold the shares behind and what started to happen was it would get worse and worse and worse.  So there is an elaborate masking, fronting is the right word of BEE and it needs to be uncovered and it needs to be fixed up.    Yes.    Yes.    Most definitely.    They were not Chair.    [Background noise].    I do.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair at the time we were at the pinnacle of the SIU investigation that had been presented I think in Government in Parliament at least and there was massive negative press going around and it was untenable and, and one of the reasons I am not having a go at the family or anything, but one of the reasons I put this into my statement is because plenty of people have asked me why did you not just leave sooner.  Well it was not that easy.  So I thought let me incorporate it here.    Well the meeting was very clear.  There was endless press negativity.  There was the investigation going on.  There were the Hawks with their subpoenas to Mark and Sharon Taverner.  There were all these things happening and we were called in and I recall distinctly where the fishpond is one floor up.  We went right to the end of the corridor where there is chair and that and, and basically the meeting involved myself, Andries van Tonder, Gavin Watson and we were told that listen you guys are in this pact with us.  We are brothers now and you try break loose and there is going to be problems.    It was myself.    Andries van Tonder, Valence Watson, I cannot recall if Ronnie was there or Cheeky was there and, and Gavin and we were in the middle of, of, of the probably the worse time ever for the group.    It was amazing, because we just had this continuous flow of high powered politicians who would arrive and be taken on tours.  We spent the good part of a few months just doing tours every, never every day with politicians visiting and coming to see what it was all about.    Correct.  [Intervenes].    No.  Well it was a morning occurrence Chair who would discuss the exposure of Bosasa and the press and the SIU and, and the probe and how everybody would try and get to us.  So every morning we would take a walk in the park, literally and we would discuss the matter walking in the park, because then nobody could tape us, nobody could listen in on us and that type of thing and at that stage as well we were getting very edgy about all this happening.  We were not used to it and it was then that Gavin Watson insisted that we go on holidays with him specifically.    Well normally the three of, the three guys would go on holiday together.  So it would Andries, Gavin and myself.    Yes, we did.    Ja and it was exasperated by the fact that that I was told to take the fall for, for Gavin Watson.    Well I was up; sorry, I do not understand your question.  Did I speak to him after we decided to have the holiday?    Yes.    That is right.    That is correct.    That is right.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well I, I said to him I would resign.    Sorry, I am just; I am a bit lightheaded at the moment.  Is it possible to reduce the air conditioning?  It is very hot in here.    Chair I am not used to.    Ja.    No, no.    No, it is not a problem.    Not a problem.    Thank you Chair.    Chair in, at that stage we were under a lot of pressure.  Gavin insisted that we go on a holiday together, but the one, the one issue that I had was I actually confronted Gavin Watson in the boardroom one day when he made a suggestion to me.  He told he had received some advice and he said that we should take a, I should take a fall on behalf of the company and on behalf of Bosasa in the SIU investigation and I was annoyed.  I voiced my discontent with him and I, I felt betrayed by him.  I was very upset and that evening I actually left the office.  That evening he called me numerous times and started to apologise and eventually I accepted his apology and although.    Is it on record?    On record, an attorney had advised him, some attorney had advised him that what should happen is that I should admit to absolutely everything.  That I did all by myself.  I, I corrupted Mti.  I corrupted Gillingham and I should take the fall for it.  He said to me what would happen will be that there would be a file of about 30 million that the company would pay, but I would have to have the criminal record for the rest of my life, but it would save the company.  So.    Yes.    There are a couple of reasons.    I would say that is one of the reasons, yes.    Thank you.    That is correct.    Profusely.  Would you like me to continue Chair explaining it?    I think, you know what, what I want to raise Chair is what concerned me the most was that I went to the legal representative and I am not going to mention his name necessarily.  It is in the papers, but I went to the legal representative of the company, the attorneys that I worked very closely with for 16 years and you know that every time I went to the person I said listen how are we going to sort this how.  Should we not open this thing up, get the people in.  Let us talk about it to the SIU.  You know Chair what I was told by this brilliant legal mind shut up and just toe the line otherwise you are going to implicate everybody and that was perhaps an awakening moment for me that I realised that why would this person after all these years still indoctrinate me with it and that is what has happened to the other witnesses who are following me right now.  Is that you indoctrinated to believe that you cannot talk out.  If you talk out you do not have money.  You do not have an attorney.  You know, you have got no protection and they will swing the whole thing against you.    That is correct.  It did take place.    The issue was discussed in depth.  We, we discussed the issues.  We got them all out on the table but the, the more one looks at it in retrospect it was all done just to appease.    Yes, he did.    He said that we have to remain inseparable.  We have to be together otherwise what will happen is they will break up the team and the, everything will come out.    Everybody would go down.    I think the, the attitude was that he believed that he had everything under control, politically.    At one stage I started doubting all of this.    Chair I have watch that company grow from when I started with 430 people to 6 500 and they all families and the biggest concern for me was always, you know, the families and what is going to happen to them and I am not, I am not; you can speak to anybody who is there or who was there, but I eventually started believing that there was no hope.  I would be left to the wolves and the real threat of leaving Gavin was basically that you would have to go against him and I knew what he was capable of.  I have, I have, I have felt it.    The directors were, were all of the view that we have to fight this and not give up and, and just keep fighting the SIU case, fighting the NPA, fighting the Hawks.  Just keep fighting, fighting, fighting until eventually it would go away.  I remember Brian Biebuyck used to tell me this thing will never get to trial.  He said to me the NPA is useless.  The, they will never ever be able to prosecute.    Well.    Well Chair let me give you an example.  One of the instructions I had received was to put 30 million in a trust account to protect us and a further 10 million in another trust account with another attorney to protect us as well.  Now, and I was told categorically that that might not be enough.  We might have to put a little bit more in and so I started getting concerned, because if it is going to cost 40 million in the beginning to defend this how the heck can I come out, speak to people and fight this thing on my own and quite simply I have gone through the process now.  Would I do it again?  Yes, I would, but the fact of the matter is if you do not have a little bit of a war chest you are finished.  So quite simply I mean we are now close on about  families who are looking to stop this.  So it is taxing on all of us.    Accidentally the SIU Report had come out and it accidentally had been given to us which was sent through an associate.  Gavin asked me to arrange a meeting then to discuss with Brian Biebuyck on how we were going to handle this.  So we had this meeting with Brian Biebuyck and we said.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Andries van Tonder’s responsibility was to handle the banks, the financing and the cash flows of the business.  To make sure there is enough money in the bank to be able to fight this.  My responsibility was handle all the legal aspects in conjunction with Brian Biebuyck and Gavin Watson’s responsibility was to handle the politics that was happening out there.    He started denying it and he started, he started saying well I just blame everybody else.  My signature is nowhere to be found.    Chair in August 2016 I, I just could not take it anymore.  I was tired of fighting.  I had basically given up.  I was, I was really annoyed about all of this and on my own, my own free will I sat down with Dr Jurgen Smith who was a kind of a mentor to me and he was a very old man and he, he said to me look I am concerned about you and he, and I just then thought to myself listen, I have given 19 years of my life.  I was not feeling well.  I was not sleeping at night and eventually I thought no it is not a life to live.  I had also been offered something else to look at and I decided to pack it up and go.  So I did not make any demands.  All I did Chair was I literally closed my laptop on my desk, took my keys of my car, got into my car and I went home and I switched off my cell phone.    Okay so basically [intervenes].    I did. 
MR PAUL AGRIZZI:  That is correct.    I think it might have gone a little bit higher because of variation orders Chair but that number seems to be correct.    Correct.    Have you got a page?    That is correct.    Chair this is a document that would be prepared by the accountants and presented as – to me as part of proof that payments have come in on various invoices that were outstanding.  Can I take you through the document Chair?    Yes.  So if you look at the left hand side it basically tells you the contract name.  It then gives you the invoice date, the invoice number and the value and then also the date that it was paid.    From the IDT to Sondolo.  So     That is correct they managed the project.    Correct.      That is right.      So if you flip over and you go to page 5 of the pack.  Sorry I think it is page 5 ja.  Page 5 you will see there the year to date receipts.    Sorry 595 hey,.    You need to – if you could – if we could just go to page 4 first.    Which is 695.    Yes 695.    So.    If you have a look at 695 it will also show quite clearly the year to date receipts.  Those are payments to date and then the 2.5% management fee at the bottom there and that information is then brought over to page 696 where it says then the total amount that Bosasa or Sondolo at least have been paid is R98 842 000,00 and the bribe provided for already provided for is R2 026 000,00 and then if you look down you will see additional management fee which is based on this voice is R394.  So the bribe that would be paid would only be the R394 000,00.    This schedule would be prepared on a monthly basis and this specifically one was the 28 February 2018 – 2013 sorry my mistake.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Let me correct you.  If you look at the receipts for February.  The receipts payment for February was R15 798,81 and R81,19 and the management fee that needed to be provided for February should be 2.5% which is R394 952,03.    R15m.      That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    No Chair.  The Department – those officials got over and above that.  So there were two people that were paid for instances I think it was R30 000,00 and R40 000,00 a month.  They would get over and above that.  Mr Joe Gumede would attend to that.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    That had been paid already, correct Chair.    Chair at the time we had been guarding since about 2006 we had actually been guarding some of the courts around the country and we were doing some of the special pension pay-outs I think it was and in terms of that contract I became involved you know with the cash and I submitted lists to Jacques Van Zyl and the lists included some of the officials within the department and we were told to look after them.  Various benefits as well as repairing cars, getting furniture for them, all that type of thing that would be requested by either Mr Joe Gumede or at that time Mr Trevor Mathenjwa.    He told me that he would like R40 000,00 a month for Ms Mams Nyambuse who does the security full justice overview and he also said he wanted R30 000,00 a month for Mr Norman Thobane.      That is correct.    I think I would have to go through it Chair.  I – right now I cannot – I cannot recall.    Yes.    I think they do.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I would not say that the prices were unnecessarily inflated in terms of taking rands or cents.  I mean if you bought a litre of milk and compared it maybe 3% more but the reason why was because of the systems that we had implemented.  The operational management of control that made it a highly profitable business.  The other reason why it could sustain that was because remember all the bribe money was tax free.  So instead of declaring higher profits, reduced the profits and it was able to – to generate good substantial returns.    That is correct Chair and I am in the process of helping SARS with it.    Chair it was negligible it was maybe 5%.    Effect on the net profit.    Chair if I remember correctly he worked at the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and his position there was Head of Security and he was a liaison really.    Well number 1 is Chair I was – these things were discussed with me openly with Mr Gumede who I had a very good relationship with and what happened was I was present when some of the payments were actually made.    That is correct.    Correct.  That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    If I may just clarify – put a point of clarification.  You must recall that I actually handed money to Mti to distribute as well because he used to take the money for Nomgcobo Jiba, Mrwebe, Jolingana and all the others as well.  So I just want to clarify that.  But yes.    Correct.    Correct.    I would have to work a list out and actually give you another list.    Yes I would do this.    I will.    I will provide that.    That is correct.    Chair I was in the presence of Johannes Gumede when it was paid over to them.    That is correct Chair.    Chair it was on a few occasions.    In regard to both of them and just to add as well I am looking for the actual names, they are on the list somewhere.    And I am also trying to recover the accounts paid for the repairs on vehicles and that for them as well Chair.    Yes in terms of DOJ and Constitutional Development I have direct – I was there when it was paid over.    The one incident happened specifically at the Sunnyside Park Hotel I think it is called in Pretoria.    In Sunnyside.    Over a breakfast    And it was at the time when the guarding contract was being negotiated.    At that meeting was Mr Joe Gumede with me.    On that specific occasion there was Norman Thobane that was present with me.    No she was not.    The other incidents were at restaurants and at impromptu meetings.    I cannot recall exactly where they were.  That one I specifically remember.    You know there are so many meetings Chair that one cannot always remember.    You know did you meet at the Fishmonger, did you meet at Tasha’s?    Where did you meet?    Yes Chair.    Those are the only ones I have direct evidence of Chair.    But I was told.    And I made that statement very clear.    That is correct.    Chair if I recall correctly it was actually at the Bosasa offices.  She was visiting there and it was afternoon.  That was another incident.  I am trying to recall them now.  I did not know that you would ask these questions and…    So I am trying to recall now.    That is correct Chair.    So there was various upgrades as well.  For instance the SALU building where they operating from.  It used to be called the Suid Afrikaanse Landbou-unie building and basically that was being renovated.  There was no tender processes.  No prescribed reason why they did not go out on a tender process.  The value of that contract was in the region of about between R20m and specifically with that there was resistance from the Billion Group who owned the building and were responsible for the upgrades because they would have to pay.  And there was just – they were liable for the actual upgrading and the payments thereof and there was extreme, extreme resistance from the project management team who did not like the fact that they had been dictated to by certain people in justice especially with regards to using Sondolo.  They wanted to use an independent that was far more cost effective number 1 and someone who they had worked with previously.  Eventually Sondolo got the business albeit that Billion was not happy about it at all.  Then I was asked – I was told by Mr Seopela that I needed to provide R1.9m as a fee for the arranging of that contract.    It was paid to him in cash.  It was paid to him in cash.  I am sure if – if he paid it over to the people he said he paid it over to.    It was paid to Mr Seopela in cash.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair and also to facilitate the payment because we had major problems getting payment out of Billion Group.    I can only tell you Chair that I paid over the money to him and he said to me that people are waiting for their money and that was it.  Whether he paid them or not I do not know.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    The contract was eventually paid for.  It was discounted at one stage so that they would pay it.    So it was during 2013 Chair when Correctional Services put out a catering contract to continue with the provision of catering services and that.  The contract was awarded to Bosasa fortunately at that stage they use exactly the same specifications that were used in the previous contracts and the advertising of those contracts as well.  Bosasa submitted a tender application.  The award to Bosasa was not a foregone conclusion as it – it did not have enough influence over the Department of Correctional Services anymore.  So it was a very touch and go situation.  The contract was for a three year period and the value of the contract was in excess of R420 000,00 per annum.      That is correct Chair.    That is correct that is the total contract value.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    Correct.    After the cash deductions and all that we should be coming out at least with a 40% GP and normally about a 28% net profit.    Sorry GP gross profit.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Chair I think if you have got the right connections you can get your name to disappear anywhere.    No sorry I do not sorry.  I do not.    Correct.    Correct.    It is the same pattern that is in the Sheraton Hotel on the floor.    Correct.    It matches it is exactly the same pattern.    Chair I would have to check with the investigators.  I have not been back to the Sheraton since.    Unfortunately Chair I have – as I get an upgrade I hand them out.  I give and I cannot remember who I gave that phone to I am sorry.    Probably staff members Chair that I gave it to.    If I can just add one thing.  If you look at the metadata on the actual photograph because it save automatically to the Icloud account.  The metadata gives the exact location where that photo was taken.    Not on my phone no.    She was very specific that she asked me to return everything.    Yes I did.    That is correct.    I gave the investigators the actual photographs that were taken.  I emailed them to them.    In print – well in raw form.    They kept the photographs.    Correct.    Correct.    If I can explain.  My phone automatically syncs with my computer so all my photographs from day dot when I started taking photographs appear on my computer as well.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    It is a hall probably the size of this hall with sub-divisions in it Chair.    Chair I was just out of her sight but I could see her.    In the reflection of the glass of the – because the room is surrounded with glass.    So I could see her.    They would.    Unfortunately I did not print it out otherwise I can have it done.    Most definitely.  When I got back and I said I had made notes to Ms Myeni and we were sitting there with Mr Watson he said “please this has to get shut down now.”  Has to be closed.    He said this has to be shut down now, it has to be closed up.    No, no while we were with Ms Myeni.    So I came back, she asked me “did you take photos?”  I lied to her and I said “no I did not.”  I was not about to tell her I did and then what happened    And I mean Mr Watson was well aware that I had taken photographs.    I told him – I told him in the car on the way back.    After the meeting I said to him – I explained to him why I did it.    That is correct Chair.    Chair she said she would work on it.  I mean that is what she said “I will work on it.”    That is correct.    I could see through the – I explained earlier Chair.  I could see from the reflection of the window she kept looking in my direction and that is why I thought let me just get this docket back to her.    Because Chair I could not – there was no ways I could write all that down in the space of five minutes.    Unfortunately Chair I do write slowly so – and it is fountain pen and it was a lot of information.  You know the first three pages that I copied I mean that took me the best part of nearly ten minutes.  The rest I photostatted – I quickly photographed because I did not have time.    Some I wrote out.  The first batch that I got because I worked from back to front I think.  The first batch that I wrote some notes down I copied and made my own shorthand notes.  And the rest I photographed.  I might have missed one or two.    I do not think so she would confronted me.    Well I would not say she interrupted me.  I watched her in the mirror and she was very nervous and fidgety.  So because of that I – the whole process was interrupted and then I – that is why I say I returned the docket back to her.    No, no, that is – she was sitting with Gavin Watson.    If I can give you some background Chair?  One morning a lady appeared at one of those prayer meetings and her name was Zuki and she came in and she was introduced by Thandi Makoko to myself because she was very early.  And later when Gavin Watson was there she was introduced to Gavin Watson and the next minute later during the morning I was asked to top up Thandi Makoko’s credit card and I am just giving you an overview it might not be in my statement but to top up her credit card because she wanted to go buy dresses for the lady.  So I did it because I was – I was asked to do it so I allowed it and I processed it.  And then later that afternoon I got a phone call from Gavin Watson to say that I must pick him up at his house at it was about five, six o’clock and I had to take him through.  But then later on I learnt that this lady Zuki Madonga was – she was actually running a guest lodge of sorts in I think it was in East London and she had a very good relationship with President Jacob Zuma.  She had worked through him with the rape cases and she was a prayer warrior for him.  And she was open about it.  And I then took Gavin Watson to – to the Forest Town house I still remember how to get there and it was on the left hand side in – at a bend at the end and I – I said to Gavin “well you know I am going to sit in the car I am not coming out.  Rather let me wait in the car you have a one on one with him and deal with it.”  That was [intervenes].    That was Jacob Zuma’s house.  I can explain the house to you as well.    That was just when he was President of the ANC but not President of the country yet.    Ja probably.  But I remember it was that Monday or the Tuesday he – it was Tuesday evening because that evening it was just after the I think it was Mangaung or – I do not follow politics at all sorry.    What would happen is that if people were introduced to us and they were high profile we would normally take them on a tour of the office park which is a kind of a smokes and mirrors exercise we show people what we doing and speak to different staff and that type of thing.  So normally a tour would take about four, four a half hours and we would show them absolutely everything and staff – we had trained staff to give them a rendition of what they were doing and that type of thing.  So they had been trained in it.  So she came and visited the park.  She was there.  And you know we had numerous people I mean from – from the Minister of Health to – right the way through to President Jacob Zuma spent four and a half hours with us on a Saturday morning.    So Dudu Myeni would have frequent meetings with a chap by the name of Trevor Mathenjwa.  He is a director and he comes from the KZN area.  He has a very good relationship with Ms Myeni.    Correct.  One of the subsidiaries if I am not mistaken he sits on the main board but he also sits as a MD for Sondolo IT or it is now called GTS.  So Trevor was responsible for handling Dudu Myeni.  But one of the critical issues that Trevor needed to sort out was the NPA matter and the Prosecutions matter of Bosasa.  So that was given to Trevor as a task.  Everybody knew that Trevor was the man who would deal with Dudu Myeni and the NPA issue.  Often I would be present at a meeting where this matter would be raised and Trevor would be the one to have to deal with it and handle it with Dudu Myeni.    Correct.    I was at meetings where it was discussed and this led to the reason why the involvement of the President directly needed to take place.    Chair my understanding and from what I can recollect is that the first person to introduce Gavin Watson to the President was Zuki Madonga and then I mean we got involved and we helped and we did a couple of things for her guest house and then she kind of fell off the map.  We did not hear from her again.  And then the second introduction was done by Dudu Myeni.  So he had…    He had seen the President not as the President but as the President of the ANC.    Previously.    Chair as far as I recall I think it was Trevor Mathenjwa that introduced Dudu Myeni via a brother-in-law or something to Dudu Myeni.    I cannot remember all the detail.    Yes.    Chair it was a meeting just after that expose on Nkandla and the R250m that was spent and Gavin actually went down there and had a meeting with the President and then the following Monday we were in an open meeting.  It was with – it was an Exco meeting that I run – I used to run in the office and Gavin always liked to brag when he met politicians.  He would always go out of his way to let everybody know that he saw the President.  So that made him feel good and important so I let him have his say in front of all the executives.  And he basically told them that he had been to Nkandla and he was shocked because there is no ways that place cost R250m.  And I remember the comments still he said the toilet seats were like they were built from Builders Warehouse.  I bought from Builders Warehouse.    So and then you know so he commented on the shabby workmanship that took place there.  You know doors were falling off the hinges and it was broken things all around.    Oh I thought you wanted detail?    So the meeting that Gavin Watson had with the President was specifically to discuss the shutting down of the NPA matter and the NPA case against Bosasa.    Excuse me please.    That is correct.    This one is one of the first meetings.    After the Forest Town meeting.    Sorry.    Well what we were told was [intervenes].    Well he was with Gavin – with Joe Gumede so both of them were explaining it to us and basically it instructed Mr Zuma – President Zuma at that stage to shut down the case with the Hawks against Bosasa.  And he asked the President at that stage to call in Anwar Dramat because Anwar Dramat was avoiding Nomvula Mokonyane at that stage.  So he needed the President to actually make contact with him, call him in and tell him to hand over and shut down.    That is correct.    That is correct.    So at the latter meeting with Mr Mti Gavin Watson basically to him he said “listen the President is actually waiting for your person Jiba to shut down this case.  She needs to do certain things,  she needs to get hold people” and basically Gavin said him “Listen Jiba is the President’s man – is the President’s person and he is waiting for her to actually make the first move in shutting down the case.”    He said that to Richmond Mti because he wanted Richmond Mti to speak to Jiba about it.    Yes.    The meeting took place at Mti’s house.  It was about ten o’clock in the morning and I was present, Mti was present and Watson was present and Watson was on the line to the President and was – he actually handed over the phone to Mti and says “here your boss wants to speak to you.”  And Mti took the phone and he spoke in Xhosa or Zulu I am not too sure but then when he was about to finish he said in English because I was sitting there, I was listening.  He said “I am ready to be deployed.”  And that is when he gave the phone back to Gavin Watson.    Yes.    That is correct.    If I remember correctly I think she was the acting NDPP.  I am not too sure I stand to correction.    Correct.    Well I did not add it into my statement purely because it was oversight but I recall clearly that there was a relationship between Anwar Dramat and Nomvula Mokonyane.  And the request was that Nomvula speaks to Anwar Dramat to close down on their side the investigation.  And there was this whole debate between is it with the Hawks, is it with or Commercial Crimes, is it with the NPA nobody really knew where it was at and that is why it jogged my memory when I was giving you the background to it.    I had, no I did resign to Doctor Smith.    Yes.    In writing.    I did not feel well.  I was feeling – I was feeling as if – if I looked at people as if they blaming me now because they had been fired, they have been destroyed, families being destroyed.  I just – it made me sick.  I was – at that stage I did not know I was sick but I was very sick.    That is correct.    Doctor Smith was one of the founder members and he was an elderly man.  He is a professor and he had been from the onset – the start of Meritim Hostels which then was bought out and he was wise and I liked his – the way he dealt with us.    And even though I was senior than him I went to him for advice.    So I just – because he was running the payroll I left my resignation with him and I said to him I am not – you will not see me again.    Well he – he was – he is two minds.  He says you know I want to see you happy and I want to see you go.    And the fact of the matter is that you know he was a bit concerned but he wanted to see me happy as well he told me that.  And I – so I resigned and I switched off my phone for two weeks.    My phone was off Chair but it was incessant.  My wife would get calls.  Then I put my phone on then all the messages come through so it was – it was just a barrage of interruptions and messages.  You know you have been chosen by God to lead with me and all this stuff to try and get me back there.    After two weeks I did take a call probably the biggest mistake I ever made.  But I refused to see Gavin Watson.    It was from Brian Biebuyck, the attorney.  Brian Biebuyck pleaded with me to have a meeting with Gavin Watson.  He wanted me to meet with him and to sort things out.  And I said to him I said “I do not want to meet.”  I was not interested in meeting.  And he said “no I have to meet there are issues that we need to deal with.”  And he cautioned me he said “listen you better stick together with Gavin Watson otherwise you are all going to end up in jail.”  That was the threat that was always meted out to us.  So I refused to meet with him.  I just said “look I am not going to meet with him.”  The next minute Cheeky Watson, Daniel Cheeky Watson arrived at my house and started talking to me.  Do you want me to carry on?    That is correct.    In 51 let me explain Chair.  That I was confronted by Cheeky.  I was told “listen you better take the reins at Bosasa I want you back in the seat.  There is a wellbeing of four a half thousand or five thousand employees that are dependent on you.  You better go and help.  You better start working. Gavin has agreed that he will remedy his old ways.”  This is as it happened.  He says and he said “you know what you take over now alright Gavin is getting – he is an old dog” he said “and he needs to go home and as long as he is there there is going to be problem.”  So he said “you come back and I am going to make sure that you are looked after.”  So he made a substantial offer, a retainer and a shareholding agreement.  So what the agreement entailed was a ten year retention agreement and it entailed probably earnings of about R12m per annum plus a lump sum payment, plus bonuses every year, plus shareholding in the company as well.  So there was shareholding in one of the companies called Lamozest which literally is where all the dividends go anyway.    L-a-m-o-z-e-s-t.    That is correct.    I – does – do I have to repeat them?    That is correct.    I think the total value of the contract Chair was about quarter of a billion rand.    For the ten years.    Yes.    Yes.    No.  No he was just – me and him had a fair relationship and I did not want to see Gavin Watson at all and they sent him because of the – we had a fair relationship.  I would not say it was a brilliant relationship.  It was very business-like at the most of times but you know they sent him to negotiate with me.  And it was a negotiation Chair.  They literally put the offer on the table and said to me “do you want this or do you want to negotiate?” and I accepted it out of good faith.  I did not negotiate.    Nothing.    Yes.    That is correct.    Brian Biebuyck actually did the offer.    Brian Biebuyck actually – the attorney.    Did the offer with Gavin Watson.    And they sent it via Cheeky to me.    And I looked at it and I accepted it.  I did not negotiate.  I did not – I was not interested.  You know Chair sometimes you can horse trade and that I am not like that.  They put something in front of me and I signed it.    Obviously I read it.    But I could have probably said listen I want R300m for the contract.    And they were happy with – I was happy with what they offered me in the contract.  That is why it is not a secret to anybody.    You know what – you know what made me make the decision to go back?  Was because I was told Gavin Watson would allow you to take the reins.  We can get rid of this A political corruption that – this political corruption that is taken place and we can fix it up and we can become A Political as a company.  Now that is what interested me.  Because that is all I had been fighting for all those years.    I do not dispute that.    No it happened – ja I need to check in the annexures.  I think it was about the 12 August 2016.    He presented me with a written document.    That is correct.    I think more attractive to me was the shareholding than the financial value because the shareholding would have given me rights.    Yes.    Yes I did.    I do.    That is correct.    Yes it was signed.    That is the agreement, correct.    Correct.    Yes I did Chair.  If I can explain to you what happened was I was given a Professor from Wharton University or a lecturer at Wharton University that worked with me on doing a – on re-engineering and drafting a document to do a turnaround strategy.    It was exceptionally well received.    From Wharton University to work with.    To restructure and re-engineer the company.    Yes.    That is correct.    Most definitely he was over the moon by the strategy and the way we were going to take it forward.    Yes Chair.    Correct Chair.    Well Chair.    Sorry I am just getting to my notes.  Sorry.  So in November 2016 [intervenes].    Yes Chair.    It was in early September Chair.    The first two weeks in September – the second two weeks in September.    The implementation would start happening from November, December, January, February and various – I mean we had very high powered individuals there who could assist us.    Employees that were brilliant minds that could assist us.    Well.    Yes I am just – sorry I am looking for a reference point and something else.  Sorry Chair.  In November 2016 I just came to realise that he is not being sincere with me and what he promised.    That is correct.  And there is something wrong because he was not happy as he knew that you know that I was making changes and I then demanded I said look it my son’s wedding on the 27th I knew he was at the – going to be at the wedding and I then the day after sent him a message and said “listen here we need to sort out this shareholding?”    That is shareholding that I was promised in terms of my agreement to come back on the retention.    It was important Chair because once you have shareholding you know as well as I do that you then can call for reasons and you can make it a little bit more difficult to do these type of things.  So you can start raising concerns.    Yes Chair.    Chair everything was implemented except the shareholding.  He held back on that.    I am trying to – I am trying to put this nicely.  He was not happy.  He said you know it is turbulent times and that and he did not want to do it because he knew exactly where it was going Chair.  He knew that if I had the shareholding that was in the agreement basically there would not be much corruption that could take place.  Because the cash and that type of thing you would not be able to get it out.    Ja.  Yes Chair he knew it.  Because I tell you why I say that.  Because myself and one of my colleagues were talking and I am sure somebody overheard it and told him that I was – I personally had had enough.  And I know it is the easy way to say oh well now you saying this but I have not been caught.  I did not need to come here.  I did not need to open this thing up.    Well I think the – the whole thing in the turnaround strategy was to make it more focussed on non-governmental business and get away from the governmental type business which indicates that you know you do not want to get involved with corruption.  And quite simply because corruption does not really happen well I suppose it happens in every single entity but it is less so in the private sector.  Where I thought there was opportunities was a sector where I believed that there would be minimised corruption allowed as well.    It was implied.  It was implied I can tell you what was implied that we become A political as a company.    Correct.    Correct.    It was obtained through corrupting people, you are a hundred percent right.    It was not about payment of shares.  It was about actually getting the shares certificates.  I think that is the important part.  And he just delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed.    That is correct yes.    That is correct.    Well this was a normal delivery that needed to take place to a specific person that he would normally make the payment to.  I cannot remember the exact person.  What happened was I got sick then and I – I do not know who the person person was.    R265 000,00.    Yes.    Correct.    You know I did – I suppose maybe you get to a point where you do not want to confront people so you do not want to get into a confrontation.  It is before Christmas.  It is you know I was not feeling well at all.  I did not want to get into an argument.    I cannot dispute that with you.    I do not.    Chair I was given the bag and I was told the person’s name and I was – my mind was not there.  I put it in the boot of my car.  We were standing outside in the carpark and I was given the black bag, I threw it into the boot of my car.  I was supposed to do a delivery on the 23rd or something because the person was away and I cannot remember the guy’s name now.    Of December.    I think it was the 23 December.  I was supposed to do the delivery and I just never did the delivery.    I stopped working on the – yes that is correct.    Chair I was thinking about it during the lunch break.  I have to see that allegation because if there is such an allegation I would like them to deal with it and bring it to me because I – it is the first time I have seen it.  Secondly it is very easy to say I stole money because well in theory gee everything you have seen here or the black book I could have stolen.  Not to say I paid it over to anybody so it is easy now to turn around and say I stole it.  And the question I have is if you are running a credible business it has been now two years going that I am not there why did you not report me on a criminal matter?    It was locked in my safe.  Gavin Watson collected it.    Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.    All rise. 
MR ANGELO ARIZZI:  Well he said that, what he said to me was he had learnt some information had come through to her from the NPA. 
 CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to the meeting, the other meeting dealt with in that paragraph you mentioned earlier on Ms Nomvula Mkonyane’s name but I did not understand precisely what you were saying about her.  You said somebody was not taking her calls in connection with the shutting down of the investigation into Bosasa? 
 MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.
