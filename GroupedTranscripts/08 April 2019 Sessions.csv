CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Yes okay.  Yes.    Well the time within which to make an application for leave to cross-08 APRIL 2019 – DAY 80examine remains the same.  It is specified in the rules.    So – so an impression must not be created that if I grant a postponement people have more time than fourteen days to file an application for leave to cross-examine.    Well the bottom line is that we are in this situation where once again an application is made for the postponement of Mr McBride’s evidence because despite the fact that a postponement was granted on the 18 th February precisely for the point – for the purpose that Rule 3.3 Notices should be served on implicated persons.  Thelegal team failed to make sure over more than – over a period of around what six weeks to make sure that the notices were sent to implicated persons.  That is not acceptable.  When Mr McBride’s statement was available last time I take it that it was complete with all annexures and all that remained was that copies be made and be sent out.  And now we have to postpone his evidence again.  You have indicated that the legal team takes full responsibility for this.  I appreciate that the legal team and everybody are working extremely hard and that they are very busy but there simply can be no excuse for this not having been done.  I am sure that this experience will result in measures being put in place to make sure that there is no repeat of this kind of mistake.  The commission does not have a lot time left before it finishes its work within the time prescribed to it. Therefore we need every hour – we need to use every hour and every minute that we have to do the work and to hear witnesses.  So that it is unacceptable should be made quite clear and unequivocally.  Fortunately the rules of the commission do seek to make provision that would eliminate as far as possible any serious prejudice to implicated persons.  We have maintained from the inception of this commission that the rights of implicated persons are important.  That everyone must be treated fairly and that includes all implicated persons.  They will be treated fairly in this commission and we will do all we can to respect their rights.  Where mistakes have happened it is important that responsibility be taken and that steps be taken to make sure that there is no repeat or that prospects of a repeat are seriously reduced.  I am prepared to grant theadjournment as requested in the hope that we will not have a repeat of this.  Of course we must not overlook any inconvenience to the witnesses themselves who keep on making themselves available and find that there must be an adjournment that is important.  It is important that we make known that we also have regard to their convenience as well.  I will therefore grant an adjournment of Mr McBride’s of thehearing of Mr McBride’s evidence from today to Thursday this week and that of General Booysen from Thursday to Monday – from Thursday this week to Monday next week.  His evidence being subject to when Mr McBride’s completes his own evidence.  So therefore the evidence of those two witnesses, the hearing of the evidence of those two witnesses is adjourned as I have indicated.  The implication of that is of course that therefore there will be no hearing of any evidence this week until Thursday morning.  On Thursday Mr Pretorius should we not start earlier than normal seeing that we are losing time?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  How long is the opening statement likely to take because that may be relevant to the question of when we should start and when he is…    When he is likely to finish his evidence because from what you have said we should try and aim at making sure that he finishes his evidence on Friday.  So –you say the opening statement might be three hours?    Between one and two hours?    And what is your own estimate of how many hours his evidence is likely to be even though it might be difficult to say…    But what is your estimate?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   So we might have to then start early on Friday and add some time after four o’clock as well.    Certainly on Thursday and maybe Friday we might need to start early as well?    Well they – we are going to have today, tomorrow and Wednesday which obviously will be used for a lot of other work that always needs the attention of the legal team as well as myself and everybody.  But why should we not start at nine on Thursday?  That gives you that one hour which might be enough for the opening statement but maybe you need another one?  But if you have things to attend to we could start at half past nine and just add more time after four?    Half past nine.    Okay then we will start at half past nine and then we will not – we will not finish at four we will go at least up to five and then on Friday start early.  You will just have remind me on Thursday to indicate what time we would start on Friday.  We might have to start a little earlier but also it will depend on progress that we will have made on – by end of the day on Thursday.  We are going to adjourn the proceedings then until half past nine on Thursday for the hearing of Mr McBride’s evidence.  We adjourn. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning DCJ.  DCJ as you are aware there is a necessity which arisen for an application for condonation and postponement of the evidence of two witnesses.  May I firstly uplift of the copy of the application before you and replace it with this copy?  This is the original which has been duly attested.     Chair after the evidence of the last few weeks involving matters relevant to the Free State Province and Bosasa we now moving to a new phase of the evidence to be presented before you and that is evidence relating toLaw Enforcement Agencies.  The original plan was that Mr McBride would give evidence today and General Booysen would give evidence on Thursday.  The necessity for the postponement to Thursday and Monday respectively of the two witnesses has been occasioned by the failure of the legal team to ensure – to ensure that 3.3 notices that is notices to implicated persons to enable them to consider evidence and apply to cross-examine have not been issued. There was a decision or a proposal at least that in order to reduce formalities the need for formal application such as the present could be obviated but it has now been determined in consultation with yourself Chair that this particular application is necessary despite that intention to reassure the public and to reassure interested parties that despite the logistical and capacity challenges that thecommission is facing it does regard compliance with its rules as a serious matter.  And in going through the rules it may be that those rules need to be changed in one form or another to facilitate the continuous giving of evidence before the commission.  So I will take some time for that reason to explain not for your purposes but for the benefit of implicated parties who may be witness to this particular application and for the public atlarge to understand the rules and how they operate.  Chair Rule 3.3 of the quite comprehensive set of rules that govern the operations of this commission states quite    Yes it is two weeks.    That is a very good point and I should be castigated for trying to guild the lily.  Chair it is – you are quite correct Chair the fourteen days remains the fourteen days and that – that is indeed correct.  So the full fourteen days afforded by the rules remains intact.  In relation to General Booysen his evidence was planned for Thursday and will be postponed until Monday or soonthereafter as he may be heard because it is not clear how long Mr McBride’s evidence will take.  We are estimating and will attempt to complete it within two days.  His evidence was due to be heard on Thursday and if it can be heard on Monday.  The position is that people can make arrangements to hear or be present to hear the evidence and then the fourteen day period will run from today or tomorrow.  I must say that logistically the administrative team in the commission’s office is dealing with approximately 100 hundred notices for both witnesses and so the backlog is perhaps inevitable.  In order to reassure the public Chair you are obviously aware of the planned increase in capacity both on the attorney assistance side and on the administrative side which barring any hurdles should be in place within the next few weeks.  So we hope toavoid the situation in future.    We can Chair but apart from Mr McBride and General Booysen there are no witnesses from Law Enforcement Agencies planned forthis week and next week and then the interposition of evidence regarding Transnet is    There will be an opening statement.    Before Mr McBride gives evidence.    And there may be a need for an application which I will discuss with you in chambers.   Between one and two hours.    No between one and two hours.    I can try and restrict it to one hour.    Yes.    Chair if all goes according to plan and there are questions of limited nature and there is no need for lengthy explanations to explainevidence we should be complete within two days.    But one must make provision at least in theory for time for matters to be placed in context.    And collateral evidence to be given in order to…    Clarify what is being said by the witness.    And my fear is that that may take us over Friday.    Yes Chair.   Yes Chair.    I would prefer the latter.   Yes please.    Thank you Chair.
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
