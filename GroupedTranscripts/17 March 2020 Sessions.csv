CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Soni, good morning everybody.    We are starting a little later than we should have because there was a matter that I needed to discuss with Mr Soni.  And I think we must start with that Mr Soni.  We will start with that so that everybody knows how today stands.    Yes.     Yes.  No I think that – that is important because for example yesterday there were some important documents that we – needs to be obtained apart from some that Ms Ngoye said she could get.  I know that there was also a document that was referred to in Mr Molefe’s evidence (indistinct) PRASA’s that also needs to be searched for and found if possible and obtained.  So I think – I think it would be – it would help that when the evidence is presented we already have a complete picture by way of at least statements, affidavits so that before the witness finishes the versions of people that she implicates in some wrongdoing we will have been put to her.   So that subject to a cross-examination application being granted subject to that when she is finished she would have finished her evidence as far as we are concerned.    That would be – should be the same with Mr Molefe because he was going to come back tomorrow.    But it is necessary to also obtain certain affidavits in relation to his evidence.  I am sure with Mr Dingiswayo as well.   That there may be others that we do not need to detail.  But also there is a personal matter that I need to attend to which is also another reason.  So we will try and go up to the end of Ms Ngoye’s evidence and then we will adjourn and then we will resume once the investigation is complete.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes, no thank you.  Okay.  Ms Ngoye you are stillunder oath is that alright?    Okay alright.    Full names.    Or names that you know rather than just Mr Mabunda.    But you cannot remember his name?    Okay no that is fine.  Okay.  He will be in somedocument.    Okay.    I have to find a way of not confusing Siyaya and Siyangena.  Siyangena relates – is associated with Mr Roy Moodley?    And who else?    His son.    His son.    Yes okay.    Yes.   So – so…    So out of all the names that get mentioned in regard to Siyangena here he is the person associated with Siyangena?    But is there somebody else in Siyangena who gets mentioned in the – who else?    Oh okay.    Okay.    But the person that – the person from Siyangena that PRASA really interacted with mostly would have been Mr Roy Moodley?    Okay right.  And Siyaya?    Yes.    Oh okay.  Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.   Okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine.   Yes.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay now as far as you are concerned Siyangena is associated with Mr RoyMoodley?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  But when – from your point of view when I hear the name Siyangena I must think of Mr Roy Moodley?    Okay.  And Siyaya?    Okay alright.  Thank you.    Well I will say this because I wanted to say – as I said I think was it during Mr Popo Molefe’s evidence a litigant does not review it is the court that reviews and set aside.    A litigant applies to the court.    And ask the court to review and set aside in certain decisions.   Okay.    Alright.    Thank you.      Did you say SS7C?    C?    Yes.      Actually before you do that can I just check particularly with the transcribers are you able to hear Mr Soni quite well?  I think sometimes he stands a little too far from the microphone.  The transcribers.  I do not think they can hear me.    Will somebody find out from them whether they hearwhen Mr Soni speaks?  The transcribers and let us know.  But try not to speak from – far from the…    Ja I do not know whether it is going to put it in the centre or not but as long as you try to – wherever it is as long as you try not to be too loud.  Too far from it.  I see things fall apart.  Okay whatever is convenient as long as when you speak you are not too far from it.  I am just scared that the transcript might have too many inaudibles in the end.  I am trying to avoid that.    Ja.  I think somebody wants to tell you whether they can hear you.      Oh okay.  I am – I am…    Yes okay no thank you.    And just to confirm this is one of your affidavits?    Yes okay.    You must say if you need assistance.   Somebody can assist you.    Okay let somebody will come there.     Okay.     Ja, okay, I am sorry, I may be the one who is lost now, I am looking at paragraph 9 in – at page 388, is that where we all are?     Okay.     So the contract was with one entity and Sengena was a sub-contractor to that entity.     But when it came to the extension instead of doing an extension with the entity with whom – with which PRASA had a contract it did an extension with the sub-contractor?     Something that’s difficult to follow.     Ja.   Okay     Well tell me what is the correct number or the amount for the one where you say it is not the correct amount?     Yes, it is less than the ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Okay.     Yes okay, okay.     Is that a different affidavit from the one we havebeen looking at?     Okay, that is in another bundle.     E?     B for Beatrix, Bundle D or Bundle BA, ja okay.     Okay, 126, page 126?     167, oh but that’s the one starting at 126 I guess.     167.     Yes, no, no, no it is not confusing.   167?     Okay.     Okay page 167.     Now that’s paragraph of?     Okay.     Well I am sorry why do you say it was a result of the telephone call?     Yes, but what I am asking is whether are you basing that on what somebody said or ...[intervenes]     Oh from the ...[intervenes]      Yes, you will talk to ...[intervenes]      I just want to make sure that I know what the basis is for saying that.     Yes, no that’s fine.     Ja, okay, thank you Mr Soni?     Paragraph 17?     16, at page 174, let’s complete the reference Mr Soni for purposes of the transcription.    Yes okay, thank you.     So these further extensions originate from the contract which Siyangena was not a party.     But Siyangena ends up being the direct beneficiary of extensions.    Ja, and to many train stations.     Yes, and what happened to the entity that had originally entered into the first contracts along these extensions, was it pushed aside, was it still going along, what was happening?     So the sub-contractor took over?     (laughing) ja, okay.     Ja, okay.     But the original entity fell off completely, didn’t provide, as far as you know even any capacity that Siyangena might not have had to deal with so many train stations.     It was not involved.     Yes, okay.     Now the point you were making about when you said let’s look at when this happened, and saying when what it was for was the point you were seeking to make that the need, for this head following away in the light of the fact that the World Cup had come and gone.    Is that the point you are making?     Yes, yes.     Would the position be that even though originally the idea may have been to do this for the World Cup when it may have become clear that it wasn’t going to be ready before the World Cup, it was proceeded with in any event on the basis that it would be helpful to PRASA anyway?     Yes, yes.     Yes you see I am asking these questions so that I appreciate the point you see to make.   One point would be the needhad fallen away ...[intervenes]      ...therefore there was no need for them to proceed with this project once it was clear that it wasn’t going to be ready  for the World cup, that’s one point.     Another point would be to say either in addition to the first point or as a standalone point to say processes that ordinarily would have to be followed for this to be done, whether for the World Cup or not for the, were not followed because it was said it is for theWorld Cup based on urgency but once it became clear that this was not going to be ready for the World Cup then it shouldn’t have been proceeded with because then there was no need or basis to justify ...[indistinct] processes if it was now being done just for PRASA.     You make both points?     Okay.     Okay.     Alright, let us take the tea adjournment, we will resume at half past eleven, we adjourn.     Let us continue.       Well I may as well just say this for what it is worth, the name Siyangena is interesting but I do note that it is not Siyabangena.       Those who understand Isizulu and the current township language will have a certain connotation I think Mr Soni understands it to but if not somebody will explain and it is quiet interesting in the contextof what happened here the name here, okay yes.       2011 [intervenes].      I am sorry maybe there is some mistake in paragraph 23.  Or unless I am confused.  The submission requested BAC to recommend to the FCIP the appointment of Siyagena for the project called ISAMS for a tender of 1.1 billion rand and for a period of fivemonths.  Having deliberated on the submission the BAC decided not to recommend the award to Siyagena or the possible appointment.  So, it is not at – at FCIP level as yet, at that stage.     Okay, okay, okay.     Now you said the minutes of the Board –of the BAC.     Were not signed?     Now if that is the case how do you know what their decision was?     You have a recording?     So, when you listen to the recording it is quite clear that [intervenes].    Oh okay.     Okay and then the recording has been transcribed.     Yes, okay but in –in in at some stage a document was discovered that appeared to be signed by the Chairperson [intervenes].      Suggesting that the BAC had decided that Siyagena should be awarded.    But you say in the stations seems to have suggested that the then Chairperson of the BAC said she had not signed.     Yes okay.     Was it established did PRASA conduct any other investigation to establish whether that was true?     Yes.     Yes, okay.      And well knowing who –knowing who did that signatureon that document that purported to be that of the Chairperson might throw light on who wanted what but I accept that maybe for PRASA’s purposes once the Chairperson says it is not my signature then they may have said well then nobody can claim that such a decision was taken if the person if the Chairperson says it is not her signature.     And then it may well be that from our side or our place we do not – we do not need to do anything about it but it may well be that it is something that could throw light if it was to be known who’s – who had put in that signature.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes –no –no I think that would be important and if that is the allegation and given the role that Mr Mbata I think seems to have played it might be important to establish whether indeed it is Mr Mbata who purported to forge the Chairperson signature.  So obviously they ought to be documents that have Mr Mbata’s signature at PRASA and acomparison of signatures and expert and writing expert is it could throw light okay.     I am sorry.  In the proceedings that you have referred to in which you say Miss Ngubani alleged that it was Mr Mbata who had forged his – her signature and do you know whether she was saying that because she recognised that handwriting as that of Mr Mbata or whether she knew some more information about how that had happened.     Okay thank you.  I think with all this latest information I think something should be done to see whether or whose signature that was.  Thank you     Well that is interesting.  So, you say that if the BAC refuses or refused as it refused to make a decision that Siyagena even be awarded contract.  The matter should have not gone to a [intervenes].     FCIP.      And whoever was sponsoring the matter I use the term Mr Mbata in this case.  He should have gone back to the BEC[intervenes].      The BAC after attending the queries.     Okay, so that is [intervenes].      What should happen?     If he is able to attend to them [intervenes].     And rectify the –the –the whatever errors maybe there.     It cannot proceed.     If he is able to in his view satisfactory attend to the queries and managing from the BAC would he then be entitled to later on have it placed before another meeting of the BAC for them to see whether now they can make a proper decision.      That- that is what would happen.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Now when a matter comes before the FCIP would not the FCIP normally require proof that the BAC has made the right decisionthe recommendation that makes it necessary for the matter to come before the FCIP.     It would have to?     Because they are supposed to look at the recommendation of the BAC.     That is right.     Now if Mr Mbata within three days after the BAC refused placed the matter before the FCIP how would it have been possible in circumstances where there was no recommendation from the BAC.     So in the position that Mr Mbata placed before the FCIP this minute that is alleged to have been got and suggested that the BAC had decided to recommend Siyagena.     Yes.     Would not have entertained the matter.     But you are – are you saying you the that document that is now alleged to have been forged was definitely placed before the FCIP.     Okay.     Yes, yes    So there is about 8- and additional 800 million rand ... (intervenes)    Just thrown in.    And having regard to the documents that were placed before the BAC and the documents that were placed before the FCIP, in what document does this change?  Is there an alteration in some document that was before the BAC, alteration of the number of the amount or is there a new document that was not before the BAC that is put into the documents that will go to the FCIP?    Yes.    Is it possible to get the documents- the set of documents that served before the BEC, the set of documents that served before the BAC and the set of documents that served before the FCIP? You have got that somewhere at PRASA.    Okay.  If we can get those, it is basically all the levels, BEC, BAC, FCIP.    So one can have the- so I can have the documents in front of me I can see where the differences are in terms of what was placed before which level.    Yes okay.    Yes okay.  As long as we have got them.    Before the Commission.    But what was before them ... (intervenes)    Was 1.9?    So if they said negotiate, they knew that they were saying negotiate in respect of 1.9?    And if they did not want the contract to be concluded at 1.9 they would have said if- depending on what they meant when they say negotiate, one thing is they could be saying, negotiate a lower price or they could be saying negotiate everything and conclude a contract and we leave it up to you.    But if they did not want the contract to be concluded onthe basis of 1.9 billion, they would have said, well negotiate but if the price does not come down to whatever with a figure, then do not sign.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   So if they said negotiate without putting any conditions in terms of what amount it means that they had no particular discomfort about a contract being concluded on the basis of that amount.    Ja.    It is about 2 billion.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    But also, the issue of the budget is it not?    Do we have budget for this?    It is the most obvious question.    And as you say then they higher the amount then more cautious.   The board rule should be and the more it should ask probing questions.    And ask for documents and so on.    Yes.  Okay, I guess we- it will be important to get even the minutes of these various levels when laid out with this issue, BEC, BAC, FCIP and board.  So one gets a good picture because it is- there are strange versions.    Ja.  Okay.    I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Soni.   So the people who sit in the BEC, BAC and FCIP are officials of employees of PRASA, no board members sit there?    Ja.    Is a subcommittee of the board.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja well, I was asking that question because I was wondering whether somebody who may have sit at one of these levels would not pick up the discrepancy on the price when the matter came before the board.  But if board members were only at- advice at ... (intervenes)    FCIP level and they were misled into thinking that this was the price that had already been attached to this project, they might not have any issues when it came before the board.   Whereas if somebody who have sat at BAC level happened to be aware that this matter was before the board and saw the figure they will say, hang on, when this thing was before us the figure was 1.1 so how do you explain this.    But ordinarily the report that will go to the FCIP would have been prepared by the chairperson of the BAC.    It is normally.    That is what happens normally?    Yes.  But what I am trying to understand then you see you say at PRASA.  What I am trying to understand is what the practice was at PRASA generally?  And that what happened on this occasion was something that did not accord with practice at PRASA.   Is it always prepared by this ... (intervenes)    Procurement- oh, okay.    Yes.  So we found out in other transactions Chair that were done where the board started questioning certain things.    Yes.    The FCIP.    The BAC, ja.    Ja, it is quite strange if it is referred to as a report of the BAC to the FCIP.    If it is not prepared by the BAC or the chairperson of the BAC.    Because actually it means it is not a report of the BAC.  It means that someone ... (intervenes)   This report of what the proceedings- how the proceedings were.    Okay, but that was PRASA practice?    Okay.    He effectively sponsors.    Yes.    Things that comes before this committees.    Okay.    Well when you say Protea Coin tendered contract wise was 1.3 billion and it was much cheaper than Siyangena’s one.  You are comparing that price with 1.9?    Yes.    Yes.  But at- we know that at ... (intervenes)    BEC level ... (intervenes)    All the prices would have been there.  Is that right?    But do we know whether at BAC level all the prices would have been there and at FCIP and at the board?    It would have been there.    Yes.    Yes.  Ja.  So because Siyangena was still competing ...(intervenes)    Yes.  Throughout the process with Protea Coin and so on.    So Protea Coin’s price was there?  Siyangena’s price was there?    And basically, both at FCIP and the board level- the FCIP and the board had to look at 1.9 billion and 1.3 billion?   And on each- okay, in each case they chose 1.9 billion?    Instead of 1.3 billion.    But in the minutes of these- of the FCIP and the board and I know Mr Soni might still have been planning to go there, is there- does the FCIP and does the board when the matter comes before it, deal with what justifies taking- giving the contract to Siyangena at 1.9 billion when Protea Coin is at 1.3?    They do not?    How is that possible?    Nobody said, but the difference in the price is so vast?    Do you know whether there was anything that Siyangena had put into the documentation that anybody could or that they sought to use to say, in case somebody else has a lower price well you will still be justified in awarding us the contract because of A B C D that they do not have and, ja?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Mm.  I may have missed this but the funding model, are we going to deal with it at some stage Mr- how beneficial was- what was- did it have real value to PRASA.    Okay.    Yes, but I think what council is asking is, tell me the features of this funding model that Siyangena put forward.  I think you are talking at- you are talking about after the contract has been concludedthat ultimately, they did not deliver on the funding model.  But at the time they put- when it was simply a proposal, what was its important features    They will provisionally fund the project themselves.    Effectively they would lend PRASA money.    And then later on when PRASA had money then PRASA would basically ... (intervenes)    Refund them.    Yes.      Yes    I take it that in- to the extend that they put up a funding model that is Siyangena, that they would have charged an interest for the loan.   Yes.  Did you get to know how much of the 1.9 billion award effectively have been interest and how much really would have been the capital?    You do not.    Yes.    Yes.    That is with the funding model being part of the proposal, ja.    So this extra 800 million was just thrown in?    But what I think Mr Soni wanted and what I am interested in is, what it is in the proposal that in this funding model that may have been so attractive to the BAC members, no- the FCIP members and the board that they would think, it is fine that 800 million- additional 800 million rand is fine.  We go with Siyangena not with Protea Coin.  But of course, I think one of the points you have been making is without a funding model there would be no project.      Because PRASA did not have the money for this.    So it seem therefore that either the board would say, we take the only party that has got a funding model or we do not proceed with this whole thing at all.    It was- that was the choice.    Ja.    Yes.    Oh no, I think I have missed that.    I thought they were all asked.   And the only person who would have and should have made them aware, would have been Mr Mbatha?    Mr Gunjo.    And they did not.    Okay.    Of course Mr Soni somebody will need to speak about this on the model and evaluate it in terms of its merits and demerits sothat one can see whether the FCIP and the Board in coming to the conclusion that they should award the contract to Siyangena and not Protea Coin they did nothing more than just act in good faith on what appeared to be a sensible decision to them or whether one is able to say but really with ease I saw features in this kind of model.  Nobody could in good faith have thought that this is the way to go.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Do you – well you should know.  When was the – when was PRASA going to be required to pay back the loan as it were?  This R1.9 billion loan when it had what R300 and?   R317 million.    Hm.    Did the contract or the funding model provided notindicate as to when Siyangena would be paid?  Because I guess that we are calling it a loan they may have had another term for it but we are saying effectively it is a loan to PRASA.    You do not even remember whether…    Whether you saw it or?    I am just wondering if in terms of how long it wouldtake for them to be able to pay that kind of money if they had R300 and something million in the budget.  And I mean first the fact that the FCIP and Board saw fit to approve Siyangena’s price at R1.9 billion when there was R1.3 million from …    Protea Coin on the face of it says but how is that possible and then of course you explain that without the funding model even Protea Coin would not – even if they wanted to give the contract to Protea Coin they – they would not be able to because they did not have the money?    So they had to go to somebody who – who was going to give them a funding model and Siyangena was providing that.  But still you have to – you have to say when would they be required to pay?  In – on what terms because it might not make sense to say you aregoing to pay this amount in a years’ time, in two years’ time or whatever I am not sure.  So if that is the case then it compounds the confusion.    You know the questions just (inaudible) to say what was going on.    How could the FCIP not pick up this conundrum?    What was their solution to it?  What about the Board? Because before you can approve they have got to say what is my answer if somebody says how are you going to pay this back?  You must be able to say, this is our answer and it is doable.    Yes.    Ja we…    Yes.    Ja we need to look at that because one needs to know whether to the extent that there may be wrong things that may have happened one needs to know who was – who may have been involved.  In what way.  Was it negligence?  Was it incompetence?  Or was it intentional?  Was it criminal?   Of course that might not affect the Board.    I assume it might affect the management.   Who – who made those payments.    Yes.    No I am not counting so I am looking at 92.    81?    It is 81.    Is that on top of the R1.9 billion?    So it now becomes about R2.2?    Ja.  When it was – when the contract was originally given to the entity to which Siyangena was the sub-contractor how much was the price then?    Ja.    Ja.    But it was two stations ja?    Yes okay.   Ja.    Okay.  Okay no thank you.    No all of these extensions involved in – that we are talking about here would they have been sponsored as it were by the Chief Procurement Officer?   He was part of it?    Yes.    Yes.  So it would be it is either both or one of them?    Ja it had to be both.   Okay.  And – and at the time – at the time of these contracts – these extensions you were not yet Head of Legal Department?    You were at Intersite?    How long had you been with PRASA at the time with Intersite PRASA?    Ja.    But when did you come to PRASA for the first time?    PRASA including Intersite?   2011?    Okay.    You would not have been involved?    Ja.    Ja.    No that is fine.  Do you know how long Mr Mbatha had been at PRASA around this time?    Yes.    And at the – do you know how long he had been Procurement Officer as at that – this time?    You do not know?    Yes.  But are you able to say I mean him being ChiefProcurement Officer he must have known what procedure is required.    Or required to be followed if they were to be extensions?    Ja and the – and the CEO would have known also?    Yes.    Okay.   Well I am looking at Mr Soni I am not sure whether it is what he was looking for it – just my understanding.  What I would like to know is what would have been the process?    To be followed if there was to be an extension?    Would it not have been necessary to – to issue a request for its – in other words start right from the beginning.    Because…    You could have a situation where you decide to givethe contract in regard to other train stations to ask somebody.    And – and if you do not invite other people you – you are denying them an opportunity to bid for those train stations and you do it by saying we are just extending this existing one.    Oh.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no that does make sense because you do not want to invite too much for a very small.    Amount in value but once the value goes beyond acertain amount you might then be justified in saying let us hear what other people can tender.    Yes, no I think – I think I may have thought that wewould be able to finish with her before lunch but I think we – we have been doing what needs to be done.    So we will have to come back after lunch.    And continue and finish.    Ja.  Okay so I think let us take the lunch adjournment and we will come back at two.  We adjourn.     Okay let’s continue.     So the number was 161?     This is separate from phase one?     And it’s also for Siyangena?     Okay.     Yes so phase one has got its own train stations, phase two has its own train stations?     Okay.     Before you proceed let me just ask this question in relation to phase one.  Such non-compliances as we may find in phase one with procurement processes would there be any basis for any official within PRASA who was involved in making any decision to say, it was just negligence, I didn’t pay attention but it was not deliberate?     And – so are you in a position to say any non-compliance is – where procurement process is a requirement under phase one, could only have been intentional and deliberate?     Thank you.     I’ve heard evidence in regard to other parastatals where it would appear that somebody would say – well I didn’t follow this procedure because the procurement provisions and the Supply Chain Management Policy permits that we don’t follow these procedures under certain circumstances and those circumstances are A, B, C, D, E and in my view this was an A or B or C situation but those who look at the whole thing and say, no it was like self created urgencyor they say, well there is just no way anybody could have said this fits in to this situation but nevertheless they are able to put up something, whether you believe it or not is another thing.  Are you aware of anything that those who may not have complied with certain procedures in relation to phase one that they are putting up or have put up in the past to try and justify why they didn’t comply?     In regard to phase one and a special reference to the various extensions would the main people be Mr Montana and Mr Mbatha.     Should they have made sure there was compliance?     Yes and in regard to Mr Mbatha are you aware of any opportunity where he has – any occasion where he has had an opportunity to put up a justification, if he has one?     You’re now aware, nobody confronted him or anything?     But if he wanted to put up his justification, that was an opportunity.     He might have elected not to use it.     Yes, what about Mr Montana?     Ja he was out ja.    Okay, alright, but the one thing you are sure of is the non-compliances that you have pointed out in relation to phase one, could never have been based on negligence or ignorance of the requirements, they were deliberate?     Okay.     So actually what was required was to put the whole thing out to tender…[intervenes].     It was not done?     The situation – the procurement policy, the procurement provisions did not require that you just pick and choosewhoever you want to invite?     Yes, okay.     Now you spoke – you referred to the amounts having been above Mr Montana’s delegated authority, is that correct?     In regard to the extensions?     And is that the position with regard to all the extensions that are involved in phase one that he was involved in?     All the amounts?     Yes.     And you said his limit was R100million?     So obviously they were far above that?     And once again that could not have been out of oversight, he would have known his limit?     And if he approved this extensions, he did soknowing that he was acting outside of his delegated authority?     Okay.     I’m sorry Mr Soni, please don’t forget your next question.  In terms of the Supply Chain Management Policy and in terms of other instruments and prescripts as you know them at PRASA are there circumstances under which the Group Chief Executive Officer would be – or was authorised to exceed his delegated authority on certain conditions?     Not at all?     Yes.     Yes, it wouldn’t happen.     He would have to refer that to the Board?     When you talk about mentioning, you mean, in the documents that you issue to the public?     Yes, yes you can just specify what you need.     Ja.     And who would have been responsible for the inclusion of the brands?     Had he replaced Mr Mbatha?     Oh okay, thank you.     Now did Mr Mbatha resign when there was a disciplinary hearing or what had happened?     He’s still there?     Yes okay was that disciplinary process Chaired by an outsider by any chance?     A lawyer?     And would that a be recent decision that he or she made?    Okay do we have that?     Okay ja, so it’s important that we have that and he didn’t take the issue any further, Mr Mbatha?     It’s still going on?     Okay.    The timeframe, maybe to say, Mr Mbatha was moved from procurement more or less at that time in that particular year and then Konghula came in, do you remember when that was?     Oh okay.     But the disciplinary hearing would have taken place when?    So the disciplinary process is a recent…[intervenes].      A year or two ago.     Okay.    Was he removed by Mr Montana?     Ms Kwinana?     Yes.     Oh his removal as CPO was also a recent thing?     Okay.     No I understand but initially I was under the impression that he was removed as CPO around 2011 maybe 2012, maybe 2013 but then I thought you were saying it only happened recently.     When he was removed from there, it would have been during Montana’s time.     But you say he was not removed by him?     No I mean from the position of CPO.    Yes okay no that’s fine.      Ja that’s fine.     Or was it a parallel?     More or less …[intervenes].     Oh okay.     Well I don’t know who drafted the affidavit, specs, Iguess should have been specifications.     Okay, alright.     What brand was this that was mentioned?     And why would Siyangena be the only one that could access it?     Oh okay, manufacturer?     Yes.     Mmm okay thank you.     Over R2billion?     Phase one was initially R1.1 then R1.9 but ultimately R2.2 or there about.     Ja.     And then phase two was?     Over R2billion.     Yes.    Okay, but just to – you were talking about – we were talking about the brand now and you were making the point that only Siyangena could come up with the brand that was required.  So is the position that, in regard to phase one, only Siyangena was told that they needed to include a branding model in the [indistinct] or in their proposal?     And the other ones were not told?     In regard to phase two then the brand was put in that ensured that only Siyagena could win.     So, under phase one because the others did not know about the funding modal they stood no chance of winning?    So, under phase two is [intervenes].     Is the brand or there is a requirement of a popular brand.  They also stood no chance of winning.     Yes.     Otherwise how would they have known that PRASA would not have the budget to fund this?     Ja.     In the quiet.  Ja, Okay.     I am – I am sorry Miss Ngoye.  That is so difficult for me to understand.  How anybody could think that a job for two billion – over two billion could really not go out to an open tender in circumstances where there is no justification or a light upon that is provided for in Procurement Provisions and Supply Chain Management to say we are justified in not doing - following this procedure.  It is just so [intervenes].     It took me big amounts and obviously there will be questions about that.  If we are talking small amounts maybe it might not notice.  If you are talking big amounts you have to know that people will want to find out.     And people will ask questions.  So, I just do not understand what are the answers that you think you will give when youare asked questions?  You – you understand     Well I do not want us to forget Mr Soni before we finish on phase two.  Let me go back to the question of deliberate, intentionalwelting of processes and procedures as opposed to oversight, ignorance or anything like that to make sure she covers all of those as she sees things and so the facts that emerged from various investigations.  It is important that those be dealt be with head on to say if somebody is going to come and defend noncompliance they must know that the – the – the suggestion is that it was intentional, it was deliberate, it was no oversight.  Yes.     All the documents available.  Yes.  Ja.     And have we got it here?     It is critical.     I know I think Mr Soni you were trying to avoid bringing too many documents into the commission but some of them are critical.  Ja.  So, if it is going to be important to go through again and maybe revise your selection.  Okay, now what do you remember what kind of date that addendum would have been signed?    Yes.     Yes, okay.  I guess you Mr Soni is still going to ask you about what - about its contents.     Now, we are dealing with phase two.  Phase two isrelated to an additional a hundred and sixty-two – sixty-one.     A hundred and sixty-one train stations.     And there is an addendum.     Ja.  The addendum is for maintenance.  Maintenance of what of the train stations?     Used.     Yes.     And do you remember how long what the duration was intended to be for that - for those services to be provided by Siyagena?    Over a few years?     Yes.     The addendum related phase one and phase two?     But phase one definitely?    Yes.     And you say they were to be paid ten million rand a month?     Which means in twelve months that will be one hundred and twenty million?     Yes, and nobody knew about this addendum that is why you had to look for it?     Yes.     [indistinct]     And do you remember whether somebody within PRASA had witnessed Mr Montana’s signature on the addendum?     There was no witness, or you cannot remember?    But probably you would have remembered that somebody you knew that witnessed, that is it.     But you cannot remember when it was?     Yes, and some of us are not so good with technology, Miss Ngoye, but in terms of the old language I want to say when you went through the file to PRASA’s file where all documents, agreements and correspondence relating to that project were supposed to be there was no that memorandum was not there.     You probably did not go to a physical file and you[intervenes].     Yes.  So, it definitely was not there?     Yes, okay.     I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Sorry.  I am terribly sorry please do not forget the point you on.  Now you say that the investigators had imaged your computers, PRASA’s computers and they did not find this addendum, is that right?     So, in other words as far as you understand the Constitution, that addendum was never entered into any PRASA computer?     And therefore, it could not have been created from a PRASA computer?     It could only have been created from outside of PRASA?     Yes, because otherwise all documents that are created within PRASA.     Would be found within PRASA computers.     Okay.     Are you suggesting in any way that the reference to in the addendum to phase two, which was wrong from what you have said, was deliberate?     Yes.  No, what I am asking is it is strange that youhave said the addendum is written phase two because phase two is just starting, at that time?     Phase one got completed three years before.  Is that right?     So, I am asking the question whether you think the person who wrote phase two on the addendum did so intentionally or it might have been an oversight?     Hmm?     You think it was an oversight?     Okay, no that is fine.  I do not think that somebody mayhave thought it is going to be strange for a document that comes up 3 years after the completion of phase one will be written phase one in terms of maintenance and then wrote phase two because phase two is just starting so it would be ...[indistinct]  you think that is unlikely.  You think that because phase one had just – phase two had just started what was being talked about was phase two and in the process and somebody wrote phase two?     It may be over – oversight, you say.     Ja.     But counsel is saying in effect it would look strange that somebody who knows that this document relates to work that belongs to phase one would write at the top phase two because of oversight.     When he knows the old document is about phase one.     There must be so much to remind him that this is about phase – phase one and therefore for him to change this if it was oversight.    Yes.  Yes.  No, that is fine.  Okay.     At the time of signature or soon thereafter?     Is that so?     Okay so it was signed in April twenty ...[intervenes].     Fourteen.  The actual performance of the maintenance work by Siyagena was supposed to start immediately?     Hmm?     Because they were busy with phase two?     Maintenance.    Yes.     But do you remember up to when the warranties would have been valid?     It is the position that you do not know whether at the time of the signing of the addendum the warranties [intervenes].     Had kicked in were no longer operational?     What is the unit at PRASA that ...[intervenes].      Yes, yes.  They did not know anything about it.     They never asked for anything like that, as far as you know?     Maybe you ask him, and I will come back.     Just to complete the picture now, I am taking you to something else, he made by PRASA to Siyagena of the work done with regard to phase one over the 3 years before this addendum was find was did PRASA pay anything?     Oh, had you in the meantime found money?     You would have paid about 1.6 billion.      For phase one.     I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Just will you not just repeat that question, please?  I did not follow.    I am sorry.  Just I need to get my timeframes right.  Roundabout when in terms of month and year was PRASA discovering or were you discovering- did you discover that there was this addendum?  Itwas signed in 14- in April 2014.    But when did you discover- when was it that Siyangena took you to court?    2016.    Yes.    Yes.    So it would have been around- could have been 2017.    2016?    Ja.    Yes.  So that was about 3, 2 and half years or thereabout after.    After the signing.    So during that period PRASA had not made any payment in regard to this addendum?   The maintenance one.    It had made payments in regard to phase 1.    In terms of the ... (intervenes)    The work that have been done.    But you say that Siyangena had included references tothis addendum and maintenance work in their invoices.    After.    Oh, after you found out.    Yes.    Yes.    So they started billing you for the first time in regard to this addendum.    So they had this addendum, it was signed in April 2014 but did not say anything about payment.  Did you know- did you get to know at any stage whether from after the signature, the signing of the addendum, whether they actually did the work in terms of the addendum?    That they did the work.    Ja.    Mm-hmm.    And I guess they would not have performed maintenance work without the client knowing ... (intervenes)    That they were performing maintenance work.    Okay.    Just repeat that.    (indistinct)     And you- I would think that even if you are very rich if you have done work that entitles you to 10 million rand a month you cannot forget sending an invoice.    Yes.    Yes.    You know Mr Soni or maybe Ms Ngoye as well, if this has not been done, it is necessary to get somebody in the relevant train stations where the maintenance work would have been done.  Who would have known the maintenance work was done in the particular train station?  That is apart form somebody staying at head office who- it would be made important just to who says, no, I was here during those years.  There is no way anybody would have come in here and performed maintenance work without me or my staff knowing and if they had come in my absence my staff would have told me.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  So we need to get those papers as well.    I am sorry, what paragraph?    39 okay.    Yes.    I do no know if you deal with this elsewhere.  Under what circumstances would the approval of the Minister of Transport be required?   But what is the materiality issue?    Mm-hmm.    Mm-hmm.    Mm-hmm.    So are you saying the position as you understand is that if a state-owned entity is going to commit itself financially beyond a certain amount, it needs the approval of the relevant minister.    And in the case of PRASA that would be the Minister of Transport.    And you say the reference to materiality is really refers to that grey whole ... (intervenes)    That is specified ... (intervenes)    Yes.   And I guess the reference to materiality must simply means once it reaches a certain point the financial commitment reaches a certain point, it matters for the shareholder ... (intervenes)    Therefore, you must tell the shareholder and get approval.    Also, in terms of PFMA.   But the requirement that you must obtain the approval of the minister materiality instance, is that provided for in the PFMA?  Is it provided for in some other legal instrument?    Mm-hmm.    Mm-hmm.    Minister approval must be obtained.    Well the PFMA talks about a material ... (intervenes)    A significant asset.  Oh okay.    Yes,   Yes.    I think Mr Soni if we can get the relevant ... (intervenes)    Provisions, ja.    Ja okay, thank you.  So you say the materiality threshold, if I can call it that in regard to ask between the minister and PRASA was 48 million.    At the time.    So yes, we are talking about billions.   Yes.  Of course, in regard to- well that is in regard to the whole contract the addendum would or well for the whole year addendum would have been above the- that threshold.    Yes.  And these thresholds would have been well known obviously to the Group CEO.    Yes okay.   Sorry what was Mr Gunjo’s name?  Do you know?    I have not seen the name yet.  I just see the surname.    Okay.  Maybe somebody will look for it in the meantime. You can continue.  I think ... (intervenes)    It can be found later.  I will get it.    You said at the time.   The original or the addendum?    During those years.    Okay alright.    And that is 2011 to 2015 or thereabout.    Yes okay.    All four of them?    Ja, I guess that has no issue on.    Million.    Okay, let us answer that.    Ja.    Does not mention again what ... (intervenes)    Which bundle so that if they pick up the transcript they will know.    359?    Oh, I was looking at the- is that B as well?    Well this one has B so it does not say B1 or B2 and this one is B ... (intervenes)   Ja, will you change that quickly to make sure.  B2 is supposed to be the ones that says Court Applications Continue?    Ja, will somebody just check this thing so that we do not have to always keep on having to correct.  So the bundle in which court applications commence will be marked as Bundle B1.    And Bundle or the lever arch file which- in which court applications continue will be marked as Bundle B2.    Ja, let us get this sorted out.    Okay at page 359.   Okay.      Mm-hmm.    He bought it for 1. ... (intervenes)    1.8 million?    I am sorry.    I bought for 1,850 in July 2008, is that right?    4 t h of July 2008.    Ja.    And then you say he sold it ... (intervenes)    In 2014.    Ja continue.    To the attorney who represented Siyangena.    Sold to a company.    Yes.    Okay continue.    Yes, that would have been ... (intervenes)    About 6 years after he had bought it.    Ja okay.    And the amount was 6.8 now.    That was- he made quite a good effort.    Yes, and it is over 6 years.    Yes and the- I think you were saying, you wanted to tell me what the value of the property was.    Mm?    Ja.    3.3 million.    Yes.    And this was 5 May 2014.    And what was- and the addendum was April 2014.    When he signed the addendum- they signed the addendum.    And that is the addendum that ... (intervenes)   You could not- PRASA people could not find.  Did not know anything about.    And you cannot remember if there was a witness within PRASA?    From within PRASA.    Okay.  Mm-hmm.   I am sorry.  I was still trying to look for the name of the purchaser at- in paragraph 21.5    I cannot see the name.  You did mention the name of a company but I cannot see it here.    Mm?  Is it in here?    Oh, Precise Trade.    Yes, thank you.  And you said one of the directors … (intervenes)   Mr van der Walt.    Was representing Siyangena.    In its transactions with PRASA.    Okay.    Hoping for his running phase 2.    Yes.  And you say he was the sole director of Precise Trade?    Is that right?    Oh yes, okay.    Were Mr van der Merwe from a different law firm?  Or is it the same law firm?    Was- when you say he was the attorney for Siyangena and you say you do not know whether … (intervenes)    He was from the same law firm.  In terms of correspondence, do you remember whether there was a change of law firms in regard to the interdict?  Whether PRASA started to get correspondence from a different law firm or not?    Remains the same.    And you- Mr van der Walt or van der Merwe.  You say van der Merwe?    Ja    Ja.   Mr van der Merwe.    Was an attorney and was not councilor in the interdict or is that something you are not sure about?    But as councilor or as the attorney?    As the attorney.   Oh okay.  But you say the correspondence remained with the law firm.    okay.    Okay.    Paragraph 21    12, okay.    And who was purchasing, was it Mr Montana?    10,5 million rand.    It was paid in cash.    Yes.    Okay I am getting confused.    Initially – well there was a reference to R10.5 million being the purchase.  And then you said that agreement fell through because Mr Moyane – Mr Montana failed to pay the purchase price.  But he had agreed to pay a non-refundable deposit of R3.5 million which was paid.   And now the – 20 – paragraph 21.17 talks about R11 million and a sale agreement.  Is that in regard to the same property?    So there was a new agreement?    Okay.  The previous agreement had been between Mr Montana and the seller and this one involved trust.    You are not sure about that?    ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  And was there a deposit to be paid for this or (indistinct).    Hang on one second.  Am I right to say the R10.5million was the subject of a certain agreement which involved Mr Montana as one of the parties?    That lapsed?    And he had paid R3.5 million that was not refundable.    Oh they paid when another – a new agreement was entered into.    In regard to the same property.    But now not with Mont – Mr Montana as such but with a trust – with his trust.    Where the children were beneficiaries.    And – but was that R3 – so he paid the R3.5 million when they have to deal with the second transaction – with the agreement involving his trust?    Yes.    Was for R11 million.   Oh okay.  So – but then 21.18 you say he says the balance – I guess the balance after the R3.5 million.    The balance in an amount of R7.5 million was paid by Precise Trade Mr Smith then requested that the contract be altered to reflect Precise Trade as the purchaser.  Okay talk to me about that?    What is happening there?    Mr Van Der Walt.    Ja.      Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    The deposit ja.    Hm.    Hm.  So ultimately it was registered as PreciseTrade’s property?    Okay and I see this was happening in 2014?    Towards the end of the year?    Yes Mr Soni.    And the property that was – that was now registered in the name of Precise Trade?    The key was handed over to Mr Montana.\    Okay.    I think…    In the previous page.    Yes I think so insofar as one can get.  Ja so – so it ends – it starts being – it starts with a situation where the purchaser is Mr Montana’s trust and the beneficiaries of the trust are Mr Montana’s children.    And Mr Montana pays R3.5 million.    And as a deposit and then an arrangement is made in terms of which Precise Trade pays.    The balance of R7.5 million.    And that is registered in Mr …    In Precise Trade’s name.    But on the 26 November 2014 …    The keys for the property are given to Mr Montana    Montana.  Now who knows this?    Who knows that this is the position?    Yes.    Yes no what I want – but what I want to know is, how do they come across is it because they interviewed Ms De Beer and got a statement from her?  Is it because they came across a letter in some file where somebody refers to the fact that Ms De Beer and Mr Montanahad a walk through inspection and that Ms De Beer handed Mr Montana the keys that is what I want to confirm?    It is unlike the transactions you know purchase agreement that can be found in documents and who the purchaser was, what the deposit was?  Who has this knowledge – personal knowledge of it?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm    Hm.  But – well if this is taken from a certain affidavit then it is fine if I am told it is in somebody’s affidavit.   It is?    It is 21.19.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.  Maybe let me go back to – to you as a witness because this is your affidavit.      You will say on this date Ms De Beer met Mr Montana at the property.   Ms De Beer and Mr Montana carried out a walk through inspection of the house and Ms De Beer handed the keys to Mr Montana.    Now this is quite important.    In the light of the fact that you have just told us that the house was registered in Precise Trade’s name.    After initially the purchaser had been…    Mr Montana or his trust.    His trust.  So now who – do you have personal knowledge of this?    You do not have?    Yes.    This is what is in records that PRASA has.    That came from the investigators.   Yes.  But do you know what their source of information was?    Okay.  It is not satisfactory.  So I need somebody tocheck what was the basis on which the investigators said on this date Ms De Beer and – met Mr Montana at the property and Ms De Beer and Mr Montana carried out a walk through inspection of the house and Ms De Beer handed the keys to Mr Montana.    Ja.      Yes.   Yes.    Yes, no you may have said at the beginning of your affidavit that you are not relying on your personal knowledge.    And you rely on some records but if you – if you were able to say, I said this here because in the records that we have at PRASA.    I came across a statement by Ms De Beer or Mr Montana that said this then I would understand that.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Is there – is it your conclusion that you reached based on …   Yes on emails exchanged between who and who?  Ms De Beer?    And Mr Montana.    Oh those – those are within the records of PRASA?    That is the first thing to look for and make available and – and but apart from the emails I think Mr – Ms De Beer should beapproached for an affidavit.    Ja okay.  Thank you.  It is just that it is – it is very strange because now the keys get given to …    To Mr Montana at a time when in terms of the documents he is supposed to have nothing to do with this house.    Previously if it was at a time when the purchaser was the…    Trust then one would understand.    But it has been suggested that Precise Trade.    Should be the purchaser now.    Now one expects somebody from Precise Trade to receive the keys.    And not Mr Montana.    Okay.  Alright.    I am sorry just to round off the – the second transaction.  As these things were happening buying of property, deciding who is going to be the purchaser, Mr Montana’s trust or…    Precise Trade or who Siyangena was continuing to do work     For PRASA.    Is that right?    Okay.   Yes.    And this was – you say in 20 – April of 21.23.   In regard to this property on or about 26 October 14 Mr Montana visited the show day – well you start by saying the Sandhurst property had been placed on show on several occasions.    On or about 26 October 2014 Mr Montana visited the show day and expressed an interest in purchasing the aforesaid property.  You say Mr Montana made an offer to purchase the Sandhurst property in an amount of R13.9 million.    And the offer was accepted by the seller on the 28 October 2014.    Yes okay continue.    Mr Green again is the – that is the estate agent?    From Pam Golding.    Hang on one second.  Hang on one second.  This Mr Van Der Walt is that the same as the attorney for …    Siyangena.   So the estate agent in regard to the Sandhurst property receives an email from Mr Van Der Walt on the 6 November.    And – and then there is a trail of emails and in the letter Mr Van Der Walt confirmed that they had R5 million in a trust account with Investec.    Yes continue.    I am sorry I think let us go to the emails because I want to know what was the letter saying apart from – or is that all that it was saying that they had that R5 million in that account?    Ja.    Is that the important thing it was saying    Oh okay alright.      But what – what I am wanting to connect is who is he acting for now when he writes to Mr Green – Mr Van Der Walt?    Yes.  Does it say in the letter, in the email or not?   Do you remember?    Ja.    Do you have these emails here?    Ja they are necessary because these bits and pieces they can become very important.    You know but you say you do not remember whether in that email Mr Van Der Walt does say expressly who he is acting for?    You do not recall that?    So it became clear.    Okay.    You did not get – you did not get a copy of theagreement in regard to this one?    I see there has not been a reference to the agreement.    Okay.  Yes alright.    So – so in regard to this transaction the – the idea that the purchaser should be Precise Trade emerges …    Again.    Yes.  And now Mr Van Der Walt says that comes from Mr Montana.    In regard to the second transaction it was said to have come from Mr Smith who was a trustee.    Of Mr Montana’s trust?    Okay.      I am sorry.  Well that last sentence of paragraph 21.26 seems important.    Yes.  Do you want to deal with that?   The last sentence of paragraph 21.26.    Yes.    Yes.    So the situation is that Mr Montana visited the property during one of the show days, liked it, subsequently made an offer which must have been accepted and he paid an amount of R5 million …    Ja.   Yes, yes so – but what I am saying is, this amount is paid either on his behalf or by him but it goes via Van Der Walt?    Attorneys.    But at that stage the payment is being made on behalf of Mr Montana because he is going to purchase the property?    And then later on Mr Van Der Walt says Mr Montana has said the purchaser should be Precise Trade?    The company whose sole director is Mr Van Der Walt.    And the same company that …    In regard to the second transaction.    Had taken over …    That property as well.    And then now Mr Van Der Walt says to the estate agent, that R5 million that – they had already paid it or not?   That they had paid already to the estate agent it should now be taken as a deposit for Precise Trade.    Okay.      Yes you have got to...    Try follow it here.   Yes.    Okay.    When does this happen in relation to the finalisation of the transaction?   Yes, yes is that around the time when Mr Van Der Walt writes and says take that R5 million to be a deposit from Precise Trade or is that months later    It is about the same month    Okay.    Okay I think what happened is that you went too much ahead of me.    So the full purchase price was R13.9 million for this property hey?    Yes.  Let me just have a look here.  Oh that is quite interesting. Yes 28. – 21.28.    So Mr Coller was the seller?    He writes to…    Mr Montana in an email asking him to indicatewhether he had any interest in taking occupation of the property before transfer.    So he is wanting to see whether – so that if he wants to come in before the transfers are done.    They can talk about occupational interest and so on.  Ja.    Okay and then   No response is found in the emails to this letter or to this email from Mr Montana?    Ja.    I think what will be necessary Mr Soni is that all these annexures that are not here but are somewhere they will need to be made available and there needs to be something that tells whoever reads here where to find them.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  No that is fine.  And it may be – it may be that some way need to be found to have something on each page where an annexure is referred to which says if you want to see that go to that page or that bundle.    That it is page whatever.    So that – because when you read you immediately want to look…    Ja you know and you are disappointed when you do not find it.   Ja.  Okay alright.  I see here it    A few minutes past – four minutes past four.  I think we both underestimated how long we would take.  I thought we would finish before lunch but – but no time has been wasted.  It has all been very important.    Evidence.  Now how far are we from finishing withher?    There is still that first affidavit or not?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh okay.    Okay so – so to finish here you need about how much time for today?    About twenty minutes.  No that is fine.  Ms Ngoye you can still stay?    You can?  Okay alright.  I think counsel for is also alright.  Okay I think let us take a short break and then we come backand then we continue and then we finish.    We adjourn.     Okay let’s proceed.     Your mic is off.     Thank you, thank you.    I’m sorry, are you deliberately skipping 21.30, it seems important.     Yes okay.     I’m sorry, I think just start from the paragraph itself, on 3 February 2015.     And you are quoting now.    So the reference to our attorneys there, in the email you say is a reference to Mr Riaan van der Walt?     Yes, who is the sole Director of Precise Trade?     Ja okay.     Read [indistinct].      At the top.     That’s his name?     Yes okay.    Continue, read.     So this is after the property has been transferred to Precise Trade.    And the sellers are now talking about logistics in terms of moving out and making arrangements with Eskom to ensure that the – they are not billed for the electricity when they no longer live at the house.      And they sent an email to Mr Montana and not toPrecise Trade.     And not to Mr van der Walt who is the sole Director of Precise Trade?     They talk to Mr Montana on the basis that he – they understand that he is the person who is going to be living in the house.     Okay, alright.     So in this last email you read which is at the top of page 369, this is an email from the seller of the property.    Addressed to – who is it addressed to?     To the pool service company?     And it’s addressed on 31 March 2015 and he tells the pool service company that the new owner of the property is the person to whom he refers as Lucky?     And you say that person is Mr Montana?    Yes and he says to the pool service company he’s awaiting Mr Montana’s instructions as to the carrying out of repairs.     Yes okay.     This is now 2016?     So that’s a year and 2015 has passed since these other emails?     Okay.    I’m sorry – yes okay, they had found two extra keys for the electric pool cover.     Mr Green sends this email to Mr Montana.     Mr Green sends it to Mr Montana?     Yes.    Ja please read the email.     [Laughter], yes continue Mr Soni. ADV VAS SONI     Ja it’s not confusing at all.     Ja it’s not confusing at all, yes.  So Mr van der Walt now says to Mr Green the Estate Agent, what are you doing what doesthis property have to do with Mr Montana.     Yes.     Yes.     Mr Green is the Estate Agent here as well?     Oh.     That is with regard to the fourth transaction?    How far apart were these properties, usually Estate Agents are restricted to an area isn’t it or certain areas [indistinct] to one another.     Yes, they’re not too far apart.     Oh okay, continue.     What was the purchase price of this property, I’m trying to look for it.     Hm?     Oh okay that’s in 21.41?     Okay.     I’m sorry, I’m sorry, the first – the second property was paid for through – by Mr van der Walt, is that right?     That property was also paid for – well the deposit of R5million was said to have been paid by or on behalf of Mr Montana through Mr van der Walt?    And later on when it was – the plans changed Precise Trade must be the purchaser, Mr van der Walt said that amount must be taken as Precise Trade’s deposit.     Which means if the R5million had come from Mr Montana he would now be owed money by Precise Trade.     Yes, and then of course, we see Mr Montana being involved quite throughout and correspondence being addressed to him.    That’s the third transaction and that was R13.5million.     Ja and the one before was R11million.     Yes it went to R11million, so this one we are dealing with here now is R12million.     All these purchases are happening in 2014, is that right?     Okay.     Well you see in paragraph 21.41 you say an offer of R12million was made to the seller by minor property Trust represented by Mr Smith, was subject to a payment of a deposit in the amount of R2.4million and the purchaser obtaining a bond for R9.6million, okay that offer was rejected and then three days later minor property Trust made an offer for R13.5million and that was a cash – that was to be a cash purchase.    Yes, yes.    Does this mean this offer of R13.5million was rejected?      Now the new offer is for how much?     It’s R13.5million still that one.     Okay.     Maybe van der Merwe as well but the one who deals with Siyangena the most is Van der Walt.     And who was the owner of this Grand Tower?     Do we know?     Five - five?     Okay.  Grand Tower.  Mr van der Walt was the representative of Grand Tower.     But, is there something that tells us whether he was a director or just acting for them?  Do you know?    van der Walt was a director of Grand Tower or whether he was just acting as an attorney for them?     Okay.  But the transaction relating to Mr Gansho unless its - it connects with PRASA or somebody at PRASA, why would it be relevant?  Or does it – does it connect?  Let me ask the witness.     How much was this last property again?  With respect to the price?     About?     Three million.  Yes, but I am not sure that I understand why it is relevant.    If it does not connect anybody from PRASA to it or PRASA.     Yes.     Gansho.    Was it not part of, I thought he was part Siyagena?     Oh.     Then let me, then I must have missed that part clearly.     Oh, okay, okay, okay, because he was the one who was asking Mr Montana for approvals of certain, okay no I think I got mixed up at some stage.     Okay.  No, no.  So, the theory is he is getting his share?     I am sorry.  I am at 376.     Yes.     Oh, yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you.  Well, I see, - I see that Mr Gansho was suspended in April 2014.     Was that after these transactions?     But they were discovered.     Okay.  And ultimately what happened to him?     He was found guilty for what?     in relation to his powers in his transactions     Yes, and was his disciplinary hearing checked by anoutsider?     A lawyer?     And we can get the – see     Okay, shall we just get that?     Okay, alright.     Yes.     I see Mr Soni, I am not the only one who is poor in estimating time.  I see we are at five now.     And twenty minutes has become forty minutes.     But let us round off that is fine.  Let us round off properly.     When was that payment made?  Do you know?     Do you have the year?     It is important because you know when you place someof these transactions may be important.     Okay.     Ja.     Well then please make available that decision in relation to Mr Holele Dinsgwayo.     Yes, that is important now.     No, that is fine.  We will find some time in the next few months for a lot to have for to continue with this second session.     And Miss Ngoye do try to go find information as to when that five hundred and fifty million rand was paid.     Yes, and the of course next time you will still deal with the question of what if anything has changed in PRASA.     Since these times.     Okay, thank you very much.  It has been a long day     And it has been two long days for you and we will continue on the days that will be announced so let us leave it at that.  Then we adjourn the proceedings for the day.We adjourn. 
ADV VAS SONI SC:  Morning Chairperson.    Yes.    Mr Chairperson having reflected on evidence thathas been led since last week and some of the evidence led by Ms Ngoye I – we have come to the conclusion that it may be necessary for us to make further enquiries and investigations into certain matters.  I do not need to detail them at this stage Chairperson but those enquiries would in fact give you especially but the public a better picture of what is it that PRASA – the investigations into PRASA be revealed.    We have some of the versions we do not have all of the versions and we need to pursue those we submit in order for you to give you a complete picture.  So what I am going to propose obviously subject to your approval Chairperson is that after Ms Ngoye’s evidencetoday we adjourn the proceedings in relation to PRASA and perhaps because there is nothing else said but in relation to PRASA until we are able to give you a more complete picture and that should not take more than about two or three weeks for us to complete the investigations Chairperson.    Yes.    yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Chairperson just again for the record we are emboldening in making that proposal to you because you will recall at the outset I said we intended presenting the evidence in two stages.    So the second stage will now encapsulate.    This plus what we had intended (indistinct) (Chair speaking of Mr Soni).    Now Ms Ngoye yesterday we finished your evidence in relation to the Siyaya (indistinct).    And just to put it in context you will recall that the reason you highlighted the Siyaya matters is because the first of the person who received benefits from Siyaya or runs Siyaya – the identity of the person.  You remember that?   And who is that person?    Right.  Now earlier yesterday when you gave evidence you indicated…    Yes.    Yes.    Is it not Mr Makhensa Mabunda.    Now yesterday when you gave evidence in referring to the major beneficiaries of these contracts one the names you mentioned was Mr Mabunda who is the other person that you identified as a major beneficiary of PRASA contracts/    What Moodley is he?    Roy Moodley.    Now in regard to Mr Mabunda and his company, the Siyaya companies you refer to the disputes that had been referred to arbitration.    Are there any disputes that have been the subject matter of litigation in relation to Mr Moodley’s companies if I could put it broadly?    And have there been any matters in which you have been involved where Mr Moodley’s companies are the subject of litigation?   Sorry.    Sorry Mr Chair.    Sorry Mr Chair I would just like to place on record to assist the commission.    Siyangena is a company that does not have Mr Moodley as a director.    It is their company so they must be clear on that.    We follow the witness’s evidence.    As well including these other companies likeStrawberry Worx and Prodigy’s.    Whilst they may have been appearances in certain instances.    As the witness correctly points out here and there.    But ultimately these are not his companies and I put it in inverted commas.    Because the witness is familiar with who the directors are.    As the Head of Legal she would be.    I just want to clarify so – for Judge.  So then we have Siyangena which is a different company.    And then you have Siyaya which has different directors and different role players.    Which is – that is just to assist Judge on that aspect.    Without going into details you were saying that Siyangena paid a company which is associated with Mr Roy Moodley.   What is the approximate amount Ms Ngoye?    Now in regard to the dispute between PRASA and Siyangena what is the nature of the dispute and where is the dispute?   Now can I ask you to look at Bundle B and FS3B Chairperson that is at Bundle B page 126.    There are – are you familiar with these papers Ms Ngoye?    Right.  Firstly would you tell the Chairperson what this – what this document is?    Now before we look at what PRASA intends to review please give the Chairperson a brief background of the contracts that are the subject matter of the review application?    Just to put it in context Ms Ngoye.  This application is an application by PRASA to ask the court to review and set aside some of the contracts you have referred to?    Okay we will deal with those contracts because you deal with it in the affidavits but let us deal with them systematically otherwise it is going to be all over the place    Okay in relation to the papers in the Siyangena matter have you now made a different affidavit for the purposes of thecommission?    Please look at Bundle E and if I can ask you to look at the documents that is marked SS7C.   Yes that is right.    It is right at the end of Bundle E.    Will you explain to the Chairperson what is the purpose of this affidavit?    They do not even seem to be (indistinct).    Yes.    That – as you please Chairperson.   I am told they can hear Chairperson.    But I will still attend to the concern.    To the concern.  Ms Ngoye can you tell the Chairperson what the purpose of – well firstly do you confirm that what is contained in this affidavit is true and correct?    And what is the purpose of this affidavit?    This is one that is made on the 15 March.   Now in this affidavit you deal with a number of issues but you start off with if you look at paragraph 6 you start off with two preliminary points.  Will you tell the Chairperson what the first preliminary point is please?   Sorry before you go on just to put things in context.  The – you refer to this would I be correct in paragraph 13 of your founding affidavit I am going to refer to your affidavit in the review applications as the founding affidavit and that appears at page 141 of SS3D would that be correct?    Now who made the affidavit in the first application for review that went before court that was dismissed?   And then when you went back to court on the basis of the present application who made the founding affidavit?    Alright and then you indicate in paragraph 7 what that application is about.  Would you explain to the Chairperson?   To have reviewed and set aside?    And just in brief what were the basis on which PRASA had brought that up – as in just in brief?    And any legislation?    And then you make another point about certain dealings between people and PRASA and attorneys for Siyangena.    What – are you going to come back to those dealings?    Alright.  Now you then set out how these contractscame into being and you do that at paragraph 9.  Will you set that out as simply as possible for the Chairperson Ms Ngoye?    Ms Ngoye sorry to trouble you. You mentioned aPilot Project and mentioned the extension are the two the same?  In other words the Nazarec and Doornfontein contract is that the Pilot contract and then the seven is the extension of that Pilot Contract.    Okay and now that you deal with in paragraph 10 of your affidavit.    Sorry (inaudible).    Sorry before you get to Phase 1 if you followed your affidavit Ms Ngoye it is going to help because your affidavit I am talking about your SS7C.    To the affidavit …    Yes.  Yes.      I said I will refer to that as the founding affidavit and I will refer to the one you are now looking at as the supplementary one.      Yes.      Now if you look at paragraph 9 in paragraph 9 you raise a number of matters in regard to the extension of the contract, ...[indistinct] pointing out the irregularities?      Yes that is where we are.      Ms Ngoye in that right in the middle of that paragraph you say second, you make an important point there, what is that point?      Paragraph 10     But you make another point in that paragraph and you say what implied here the CONFED Pilot Contract was a contract between Intersite and Enzo and Rainbow am I right?      And in regard to the extent here who was – who were now the contracting parties.      But would that be proper and lawful?       In paragraph 11 you point out that the Public Protector had dealt with this matter in her report, can you tell the Chairperson what that was?      Yes and she says that contract was worth R1.95billion.      Just to put it in context, the pilot is extended, that is the matter that the Public Protector investigated?      And you say that the amount of that extension was not R1.95billion?      But there is another contract where the amount is R1.95billion?      You are going to come to that?      Chairperson just because Ms Ngoye has mentioned 800million you will remember the Public Protector in her report says the complaint was it was 800 – the extension was 800million but she says in effect it was R1,95billion so if she had been given the correct information you would have come to the correct conclusion that the amount of that extension was R800million.      Alright, then you’re saying that in fact that refers to the Phase one, now in regard to the extension in paragraph 12 you deal with the problems that you think ...[indistinct] the award of the extension.         Could you tell the Chairperson what those are?      Can I ask you to please look at the founding affidavit at page 389, this is SA7B.    Chairperson I am looking at the founding affidavit and the review application.     That’s in Bundle B, sorry Bundle E.     Sorry, sorry, Bundle B Chair.      (Inaudible – microphone off)      167 Chair.      That’s right.    Chairperson if I could explain if it is going to be confusing then I needn’t do it, I am just conducting this exercise so that you can navigate yourself between the supplementary affidavit and the founding affidavit when you are considering the whole matter, so I am just trying – but if it is going to be confusing we can just ...[intervenes]      Yes, at paragraph 17.6.     Have you got it?     No, SS3.  Have you got that Ms Ngoye?      Now will you refer the Chairperson to those paragraphs, or to those sub-paragraphs in which Mr Gantshu expresses concerns about the extension?      And what does he say there?      And who is ESS?      Alright, thereafter you point out in paragraph 13 that there was a change in heart, what – how did that come about.     Sorry, of the supplementary affidavit Chairperson.      If I could just stop you there, that change of heart came about as a result of what?   Of that telephone call was it not?      And based on that ...[intervenes]       Just in relation to the Chairperson’s question about why do you say there is a telephone call can I ask you to look at page 168 now of your founding affidavit, paragraph 17.71.      So Mr Gantsha now is in favour of the extension as a result of this telephone call, or according to him as a result of this telephone call, according to him as a result of this telephone call with Mr Montana, what happens next, you set that out in paragraph 14.      And in respect of finance’s attitude what was, what did your investigations reveal?      Who was that executive?      And where do you highlight that in your founding affidavit?      At page 174 Chairperson.      Oh sorry, yes it is SS3D page 174 paragraph 17.16.      In fact in regard to the CIDB non-compliance he goes further, he says Siyangena was not certified.     Now these were the concerns that Mr Sibola raised, what – how were these concerns addressed if you look at paragraph 16 of your supplementary affidavit you deal with it there.      Why do you think that happened?     You will recall yesterday when you gave evidence in regard to the Strawberry Worx matter.      You remember there was a dispute about where the contract should rest and they had, you were then the CEO of Intersite and you said that they threatened that they were going to take the matter from Intersite to PRASA?     And they did that?      Is this a similar manoeuvre in the opposite direction?   I am just asking if that is the analogy that one can draw?     What is the next development thereafter, now that the matter is moved to Intersite?     And was such permission granted?    As far as you – the information at your disposal is there was no Board approval for that?     But what nevertheless happened?     Now in paragraph 17 of your affidavit – I mean ofyour founding affidavit, that’s in the review application you frequently make reference to the role played by Mr Gantsho, is that correct?     And why is that, why do you refer to that in paragraph 17 of your founding affidavit?     And of course you refer later in your affidavit to Mr Gantsho again.     Then that was the extension of the pilot phase.    That’s one set of contracts, the pilot phase and then the extension.     What is the next contract that is concluded in relation or between PRASA and Siyangena.     And what did that entail?     So originally there were seven, Doringfontein plus five and then you say 69 would then that be an extension to 62 stations?     Can I just again start off with you have the pilot phase or two, Doringfontein and Nasrec.     Siyangena is not a party to those contracts.        Then it’s extended to seven, Siyangena is a partyto that.     That then is now extended to 69, or to a further 62.     Two becomes 69.     Now ...[intervenes]     Now how did it come about that Phase one wasimplemented, you deal with that in paragraph 20?     And how was that process managed, the restricted process, well before I get to that was that an legitimate way of extending a contract?     Can I just understand it, and it is not entirely clear and I know you will explain later that you had a limited set of documents, but as you understand what unfolded is that instead of an RFP being issued out to the world as it were it was – an invitation was sent to just eight companies?     Is there any indication of how those eight companies were chosen?     But if proper procurement processes had been followed what was the process that should have been followed?     Alright, the Ms Mashudi can’t find the RFP whom does she go to, to locate the RFP?     And what does Mr Gantshu do?     I am just trying to understand then, I understand you say it is not processed but what would this whole enterprise about?   I mean PRASA wants to now enter Phase one, ordinarily it should send out an RFP outlining what work it needs to be done, what the approximate cost is going to be and so on, but in this case it sought information from the eight people whom he had chosen.     And is such a procedure countenanced by any aspect of PRASA or PRASA’s procurement ...[intervenes]      Now what eventually happened, so companies are asked to deal with this matter, or well to produce solutions, what then happens?     And you say – when you look at – what period are you looking, do you look at paragraph 21?     And just for the record when was the World Cup?        Chairperson I see it is just quarter past eleven now.     As you please Chairperson.  Now Miss Ngoye we were at the stage where you say the BEC had met in regard to this contract.  What was their decision?     Well if you look at what you said at paragraph 21, you – you just, what – what did they say there?        Chair we have a situation, sorry Chair.        So, we have a situation where Mr Montana says no you are not to proceed.        Then Mr Gansho assures the team, what - how did that come about?      And the point I am trying to make here Miss Ngoye one if the reasons that the procurement system, any procurement system has a whole series of decision makers, for example an inter analysis would be done by the department in the BEC and then the BAC, would mean that each of these, each of them has a particular role to play and their decisions would be all fundamental to a fair process.        And what does Mr Gansho’s assurance to the team on whatever that means what – what does that do to that process?        Well let me suggest something else and it is not  a question of just making sense, it means if I am going to make this suggestion to you and tell me if you agree.  Did the entire process in subverted       Now that was on the in December 2010.  What happens next?     And Mr Gansho reassurance then has some basis?     Now what did the – excuse me Chair.  What did theBAC then decide?      Now a submission was made to the BAC and what was that submission?      And were they to make a recommendation to some      But the BAC in any case took a decision in what was its decision you deal with it paragraph 23      Well if you look at the third line of paragraph 23you –you if you could just read that the next sentence into the record starting with having deliberated      What are you-you trying to suggest with –with that Miss Ngoye that from your –your founding affidavit and in the review application      Could you- could you expressly tell the Chairperson what you are trying to say the BAC makes a decision not to recommend.       But what is – what is the minute what does the minute of that meeting record?     So, the minute was in fact a forgery for falsely representation.     Now if I could just deal with that issue and I know that it is not immediately here.  If the contention allegation is that the minutes were forged clearly a crime had been committed.     Has this matter been reported to the Police well this and other matters relating to this contract?     Well if it is reported to the Police it would have to be beyond mallard ministration.  It would have to be criminal conduct [intervenes].     Yes, now was that reported to the Police?     And what – what is the outcome of those Police investigations?     Doctor Molefe.     Anyway.     So, the next step in this process is what Miss Ngoye?     From the BAC if the matter is to go forward which committee would it go?     May I follow up with two questions.     We know that a document was presented to the FCIP that is the one that MR Mbata presented to them.     But that is the one that Miss Ngubani distances herself from.  She says that she did not sign that minutes.     I want to ask you a prior question and that is in regard to the meeting of the 14 t h the BAC meeting of the 14 t h of February. This–did Miss Ngubani say that the BAC had not in fact approved the – the award to Siyagena.     So on any basis whatever was presented to the FCIP we can say safely here and in this commission so that the –the -the BAC did not prove that the matter be sent to the FCIP contrary to what was said in that minute.     Now the second issue and it arises from what Chairperson has said was.  Whilst there was this minute from the BAC to say look we – we think the award should be made to Siyagena but they had a different fiduciary duty they were not simply required to accept the recommendation of the BAC they were required to check all the processes before the matter came before the BAC and how the BAC handled the matter.    Well, so they would have had to ask them if they were acting in terms of their fiduciary duties in terms of the PFMA being the – the accounting authority of –of PRASA that one would assume then that they would inquire as to why was this matter not before us prior to the process being stopped.     And the from the information you have that was not.     Anyway, the matter is now before the FCIP as you say in paragraphs 24 and 25 in your affidavit what happens then?    What was the number in the forged document?  When I say number, what was the amount set out in the document that Ms Ngubane says is a forged document?    So that document had not only wronged- I mean notonly misrepresented what the decision of the BAC was but also misrepresented the amount that the contract would be worth?    Are there an annexed to the affidavit in the founding of it?   It would be easy to access those Chairperson.    Yes.    Now Ms Ngoye you also make a second point in paragraph 26 about an auditee in respect of what happened at the FCIP meeting on the 17 t h of February.  What is that?    At the risk of perhaps being too pedantic, the same meeting indicates or approves an amount of 1,95 billion rand in respect of this contract.   And at some stage during that same meeting it is told that the budget is 317 million.    Would you be able if you were asked to explain that sort of anomaly?    What we- you have highlighted some of the irregularities in regard to the matter before the FCIP.  And from the FCIP where would the matter go to next?   And the FCIP’s recommendation to the board was a contract at 1,95 billion rand.    Yes.    Now in regard to your evidence up to 9 regard to phase 1 ... (intervenes)    Sorry.     Now Mr Mbatha was the Chief Procurement Officer, is that correct?    In that capacity would he be a member of any of the committees like the BEC or the BAC?    And would he attend the BAC meeting?    (indistinct) is not.   And this highlights the anomaly raised by the Chairperson that the person who has an interest in why they are asking the BAC to sanction or reject a contract is the person who is then going to do the report for the FCIP.    Now in your evidence up to now relating to phase 1 Ms Ngoye you have detailed the irregularities and so on.  In paragraph 28 you summarise that.  Could you just summarise just so that we have asort of picture of how irregular the process was?    And what do you say about that in paragraph 28?    Yes.     Now earlier in your affidavit, your supplementary affidavit the one you looking at, you made the point that nobody knew what a funding model was.    Now just taking that into account and it seems to have played an important role in making the- in having the award made to Siyangena.  Effectively what did the funding model entail in respect of budget?  Because what we see is at PRASA 1,9 million rand as opposed to 1,3 million rand but to what extend did Siyangena fund anything for PRASA?    As you please Mr Chairperson.  One of the things that you referred to earlier and I asked you to please look at paragraph 15 of the supplementary affidavit.  You might remember you referred to matters that Mr Sebola had raised.  One of the issues he raised is what was being considered was a public private partnership.   Now in regard to public private partnerships I take it that there are different mechanisms or different procedures that would be followed if you are asking for the private sector to be involved with an organ of state in a particular contract?    And so if it chose Siyangena on the basis that it had provided a – a funding model it would in fact be entering into as public private partnership.    And then you finalise paragraph 28 Ms Ngoye with other points.    Yes.    Sorry Ms Ngoye I am just then finalising your paragraph 28 and you say the – you talked about minutes being forgedcould you tell the Chairperson what that is about?    So it is a clear indication that you know there was a forgery of the documentation that went to the XTIP.  But also in what we have seen in the evidence in relation to the minute of the Board where the Board does not specify an amount.     So in addition to the BAC minutes being forged as indicated by Ms Ngubane there is evidence that there is a discrepancy between what the Board decided and the resolution – the written resolution?    And then you make the point that the minutes in respect of the budget were self-contradictory?    So I am just asking and perhaps this – this may not be something you can answer.  The Board at that meeting says or the FCIP says we have only got R317 million but we are accepting the tender for R1.95 billion.  Did they in that indicate that this is because Siyangena has provided a funding model which allows us to overcome the budgetary constraint?    No, no, no I am asking a different question.  I amsaying in explaining why it accepted the amount of R1. – an amount of – a contract of R1.95 billion did the Board say that notwithstanding that we only have a budget of R317 million this allows us to overcome that difficulty?    Alright so…    R317 million.    Now that was Phase 1 of the contract and was that the end of Phase 1 or where – was there another twist to Phase 1?    And just to illustrate the – the growth of the – thecontract.  It starts off with two where Siyangena is a sub-contractor.  It then ends up with seven as the main contractor.  There is becomes 69 and now with this extension it becomes 81.    81.    Yes 69.    It is 81 Chair.    And how much did this – these twelve additional stations or – ja did they cost PRASA?    And in regard to this extension you make the point that it was – that there was an irregularity and could you identify that irregularity?    Just finally on the extension if no process had been followed would it have gone through the BEC, BAC and the FCIP?    And for the record the amount being R350 million would be exactly more than 10% of the R2 billion or almost R2 billion extension con – Phase 1 contract?    Sorry just on that score Ms Ngoye the R350 million would that not have had to have Board approval given that Mr Montana could only contract up to R100 million?    But from what you know did this extension did notgo to the Board?    So that would be a further basis to impugn really the award of the extension to Siyangena?    Would that have been reflected in the financial statement of PRASA at the end of that year that is say 2011/12?    The amount of the extension or the amount of the contract?    I suppose what we would have to do is to look at the – the financial statements and see whether in fact these matters are reflected as set out in your affidavit?    Then Ms Ngoye you go into Phase 2 of the project.    Chairperson I see it is five to one.  I am not sure we will finish this in the next five minutes.  I do not mind continuing but…    Absolutely.    As it pleases.    Yes.     As you please Chairperson.  Ms Ngoye we’d finished now with phase one and the extension to it and we were going to start with phase two, you remember…[intervenes].     Will you tell us what – well will you tell the Chairperson what phase two is about?     You remember that we said that the earlier phases including phase one and all the extensions brought to 81, that’s 161 you are talking about is another 80 or another 161? MS     Now was it a smooth process, the award in respect of phase two?     And was it a fair process?     May I follow up on that, you answer is an emphatic, no it couldn’t have been non-deliberate, you’re emphatic it was deliberate?     Now is – do you say that on account of the various irregularities together with the nature of the irregularities or is there some other basis on which you’re making that assertion?     And if you look at all these contracts and the extensions starting with the first – well after the first two to Enzo andRainbow was there any open process that was followed throughout the phase one aspect.     And just finally if I could follow up on what the Chairperson has pointed out, the phase one including the pilot phase involved amounts exceeding R2billion?    As I understood your evidence, the only process that was followed – not the decision making process, the process that was followed was those eight people being invited?     And just to finalise the point, that was the only decision in which the BEC and the BAC played their role?     And the FCIP?     So all the other decisions and all the othercontract – or the contracts that we concluded were done by PRASA officials without any of this being subject to some scrutiny?    Now in relation to phase two now, you say that there was a RFP but the complaint made was that they had asked for certain brands of equipment to be used?      And …[intervenes].     Now in respect of the fact that certain brands had been identified to be used to comply with the tender requirements, what is PRASA’s policy?     And was this a complaint that was made by any of the tenderers?     Now when you say the brands – those brands were identified in the RFP.    And in respect of favouring Siyangena, why do you say that the use of that brand would favour Siyangena?     And in relation to the issue of this RFP how long before the issue of this RFP had Mr Konghula replaced Mr Mbatha?     We will get it.     So just so that Chairperson has an idea of timelines, Mr Konghula replaces Mr Mbatha?     At the time – at that time…[intervenes].     But in between, after Mr Mbatha had been removed, you say he was removed, he moved to another section of PRASA?     And he remained at PRASA until the disciplinary inquiry.     So from about 2012 to about 2018/2019 he remained at PRASA?     [Indistinct] moved from CPO…[intervenes].    Was there any reason given for Mr Mbatha to be removed from the position as CPO to CIO?      Within PRASA what would be a more prestigious position, being the Chief Procurement Officer or the Chief Information Officer?     Now one of the things you say in the – if you could read the last sentence of paragraph 34, Mr Ngoye.     But in the Swifambo matter relating to the purchase of the locomotives that’s – one of the reasons that the SCA expressly said the tender was invalid because specifications for the locomotives had been tailored made for Swifambo, do you recall the judgement?     When you used the word “tailor made” in your affidavit did you have that in mind?     So the specifications that were put out in the RFP, how were they related to what was offered in the unsolicited proposal from Siyangena?     So can you recall what the amount of that – of phase two was, more or less?     So if I could just go back to phase one, when you say that Siyagena was told, is it something you know or something you assume because they had included there funding modal.    What I understand Chair  is that as part of the discussions that happened you know when there was I mean you know I started by saying it was a subcontractor and from a subcontractor you know they got to be given the seven   You know and they were communicating with people within PRASA, you know and discussing how best it is to assist PRASA in doing this project. And therefore, you know with those discussions came the issue of the funding modal to say no we will help you out.  If you cannot afford it we will help you out and therefore they are the ones that knew that knew that you know that would be received very well by PRASA because they had been interacting with the people in PRASA, Chair, to the exclusion of obviously all those other eight.     And you say that on the basis of the investigation that you did in preparing for the founding affidavit in the review matter?     Alright, then as seems to be the practice there is the phase two and then there is something added to it.  Could you tell the Chairperson about that addendum to that phase two contract?     Absolutely.  Yes, and they must have all the documents available.     Now, sorry, we were talking about the addendum and you were saying there was a strange aspect to this.  Please can you explain the Chairperson what happened?     We do not have that document that Mr Chair, but we will obviously [intervenes].     Yes, well can I just start off by making this point that around the 31 s t of March 2014 Mr Montana had formally said that he was going to leave PRASA.     So, this document is signed after that time?     And Mr Montana signs on behalf of PRASA?     Now, what – what was the – the –the, what services were Siyagena to provide in respect of that addendum?     A month     When you say they produced it that surely wouldhave been part of the papers they presented to Court?     Can I just raise this, that maintenance agreement was in relation to equipment that had been supplied in phase one?     That equipment this given the times because this is 14 that equipment would be at least two or three years old?     Let me just ask you this and I will just ask as a general proposition, this was electronic equipment, would I be correct?     But surely in those two years equipment would have evolved so much that that equipment would effectively have been almost ancient when one looks at technological development?     Has anybody examined where there is such a contract that is worth entering into in other words spending 10 million rand to maintain equipment that might now be outdated technologically speaking?     Now the interesting thing that [intervenes].    Now, the interesting thing about and I know you have mentioned other interesting things, but the interesting thing about this addendum is, it is called an addendum to phase two, am I right?    But it is actually related to phase one.     Well in any case, phase one had phase one then it had an extension then it had an addendum all in the space of about 6 months?     And then three years later it will be odd to say then that this is a further addendum to phase one?     Well, can that be correct and I am saying this in this the document headed Addendum to Phase Two but the substance the work to be done is in relation to phase one.     I suppose that all that one can do is draw insurances from all the facts put together?     Including the fact that this about the time Mr Montana and his leaving.     Now, just finally on that in respect of that addendum whether it is correctly called Addendum to phase one or phase two had any claims been made by PRASA between April 2014 to the time that Siyagena sued for the money owing in terms of that contract?     No, no this addendum here.  That is [intervenes].    Miss Ngoye you are making a slightly different point.  This agreement is concluded in April 2014?     That is what we had before.     Now, that agreement says PRASA must pay Siyagena 10 million rand a month for maintenance of phase one equipment?     Now, that ten million rand a month becomes due at the time the agreement kicks in.     Well, I mean [intervenes].     Indeed, Chair.     Yes.     See because that too creates a problem about thepropriety about entering into that contract.  Mr Montana is about to leave, if the warrant is only going to expire 6 months from then, what is the need to enter into the contract before he leaves?     But the grace, oh sorry Chair.     I do not mind.  I know my question.     What is also intriguing is the first time you get to know about this document is when PRASA tells Siyagena to stop working.     Now, if Siyagena, if there was such an agreement, I am coming back to the point you made.  We must accept we do not know if there was any but if there was such an agreement then one would expect that if money is due in terms of an agreement Siyagena wouldhave asked for payments in terms of that.     And had there been any [intervenes].     So if there was such a contract then one must assume that at the time you told him to stop, money is owing to Siyagena because that is why they do not want to stop.     Now, had - based on the investigations you haddone and the team, had it been found out whether Siyagena had sent any invoices in regards to that 10 million rand a month?     Can I ask- oh sorry, Chair.    But one thing until the interdict application by Siyangena there is no invoice from Siyangena relating to these 10 millionrand a month?    Until the interdict application Siyangena brought, there is no invoice from Siyangena to PRASA.    And what would you then deduce from the fact that there is no invoice in- we are now looking at 2017 when this interdict application is brought.    Indeed.     And Mr Chairman if that interdict application now becomes quite important as well ... (intervenes)    Because one would then see what case Siyangena is making in relation to.    So just now in respect of these different phases you in paragraph 39 wish to emphasis certain matters.  Will you do so please to the Chairperson Ms Ngoye?    Then Ms Ngoye in your affidavit you deal with certain financial dealings between PRASA officials and an attorney associated with Siyangena.    Let us just go back to the point you made earlier as to who was driving the process just prior to phase 1 starting.  Who was the PRASA official at the head of that?    And the decisions that were there ... (intervenes)    Can I ... (intervenes)    I will look for it.    Now and who is making all of the decisions in relation to these contracts?    The contracts or the transactions that you talk about and you say they caused a giant shadow over the propriety of these contracts.  Whom do they concern?    Now in you founding affidavit in the review application you identify those at paragraph 21.  Am I correct?    If you tell the Chairperson very briefly- well let us start off withy in regards to Mr Montana, how many transactions do you say are matters of concern?    And in regard to Mr Gunjo?    So let us start off with Mr Montana.  There a four you say.    But you identified and you do not have to give too many details but if you could just tell the Chairperson what the essence of those contracts are and why they prompt concern.    Sorry.  Ms Ngoye ... (intervenes)    Let us do it in stages.    Otherwise we all- we are going to be all over the place.  Let us start off with paragraph 21.4.    You call that the first transaction.    SS3.   Bundle B SS3B Mr Chairperson and at page 359.    Yes.    Yes, there is a B1 and a B2 Chairperson because the Siyangena imperatives are about four other cases ... (intervenes)    I am going to return to you at once Chairperson.    That is so.    Yes.    Yes, that is correct Chairperson.    Yes.    359 Chair.    At page- paragraph 21.4 Ms Ngoye you deal with the first transaction.    If you could tell the Chairperson briefly what the concern is relating to that transaction.    4.95 million Chairperson.    So if I can just identify who Mr van der Walt was.  Please look at SS3B page 360- bundle B2 SS3B page 361 paragraph 21.10    Oh, sorry Chairperson.    It is 6 lines from the top of the page ... (intervenes)    And if you could go to paragraph 21.10 you identify exactly Mr van der Walt’s role.   Now in the review application, who represented Siyangena?   Then the second transaction you deal with at paragraph 21.12 on that same page, page 361.  Will you tell the Chairperson very briefly what that transaction was about?    21.12 Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.   And what was the purchase price?    Yes but then if you look at paragraph 21.16 the last sentence there.    And then 21.17 tells you who the sale agreement was between.    It went up to R3.5 million that has originally been the expected purchase price.    And just for completeness sake in paragraph 21.18 there is a reference to Mr Smith.  Who was Mr Smith?    He was the trustee.  If you look at…    Chairperson I – have you got a reasonable picture of the second transaction here?    Mr Chairperson can I – I do not want to give evidence but I thought if I could…    Assist.    It will shorten the inquiries.    In the answering affidavit Siyangena deals withthese matters.    Not in detail.    And I am going to take the witness to those to be answered.  But in addition Mr Montana files an affidavit which is not part of the papers so we will look at that to see what his answer is to each of these allegations.    Yes.    No, no it is…    It is part of the investigation but the point I am trying to make Chairperson is that we do have Siyangena’s versions on these matters.    And you will see that the dispute is quite narrow in respect.    Yes.    Yes.    Then at paragraph 21.22 you deal with the thirdtransaction and where is that property situated?    And just again in context that was ended in 2016 or 2017 Ms Ngoye?  The – that is when the interdict came when he (indistinct)    So 2014 certainly …    Now in relation to the third transaction starting at paragraph 31.22 in the third sentence of that paragraph you set out where you got this information from.   Could you tell the Chairperson where this information is from?    We will obviously get a copy of that statement.  Now in brief what was the issue in regard to this property?    And then what happened next that is contained in paragraph 21.24?    Yes.    We do not have them here Chair.  But we will – they are attached to – or on the…    Attached to the founding affidavit already.   Yes.    What do you say in paragraph 21.25?    And then what happens next?    Just on the question of Mr Montana’s interest in this property would you read what paragraph 21.29 says Ms Ngoye?    Of – sorry.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    It is not something one comprehends unless one reads it over …    And then at paragraph 21.28 you will see that there is a reference to the seller Mr Coller.    And there is communication to – with Mr Montana.  Could you please read that into the record Ms Ngoye?    This is a few days later Chair.    This is 21.26.   Sorry Chair.    Yes.    Yes.      Chairperson what I am going to propose subject to your approval is we have a special set of documents relating to all these transactions with all the annexures.   There and just a summary of what each of those transactions entail.    Yes.  That would…    Yes.    It is four o’clock.  I was just going to tell you Chairperson.    Absolutely.    Chairperson can I just say that it is just the – the one more transaction after this and then Mr Gango’s transaction.  But what I…    We had decided Chairperson that we will deal with that in the second phase and the main reason is it is a matter in which Ms Kweyama has a major interest.    Maybe we should just have all of that evidence.    It is a very self-contained (indistinct)    And one would be able to deal with it in about two and a half hours in all.   You know rather than dealing with it in stages.    About – about twenty minutes Chairperson.     [Inaudible mic not on].     [Inaudible – mic not on].     My learned friend wishes to be excused because it doesn’t involve his client directly Chair.     Sorry Ms Ngoye I just wanted to …[intervenes].     We were talking about the property being transferred to [indistinct] Trade.     Now that happens on the 6 t h of March, what happens on the 12 t h of March…[intervenes].     Oh, as you please Chairperson I, in fact, intendedto do it earlier.  I intended to deal with it earlier before …[intervenes].     Would you please, Ms Ngoye, read into the record an email that Mr Montana addresses to the seller of the property on the 3 r d of February 2015.     That’s at paragraph 21.30.     So what does that indicate in relation to Mr Montana’s association with the property?     And when he refers to the attorneys in what capacity are the attorneys acting in relation to this property, accordingto Mr Montana’s email?     But nevertheless on the 6 t h of March that property is transferred, to whom is it transferred?    Now after that transfer, to whom is communication relating to the property addressed?     Will you just indicate what the nature of that communication is?     No sorry can I ask you to read who the email is addressed to?     No please read it, if you read…[intervenes].     Page 367 right on the top.     And who, in this context, would Lucky be?     And…[intervenes].     And then what’s the next communication Ms Ngoye, that’s at 21.33?     And Mr Green is who?     Now in the next paragraph there is a further reference to Mr Montana’s involvement with this property, could you briefly tell the Chairperson what that is?    Yes.    Now at paragraph 21.35 you make an interesting observation.     And when you say that, what do you intend to convey?     Now thereafter there follows a rather infesting communication, would you tell us [indistinct] what that is?     But you then put some context to that Ms Ngoye an that’s at paragraph 21.37.     And obviously what you say at paragraph 21.37 appears to have prompted that email.     I mean that communication.     Thereafter we deal, at paragraph 21.38, with the fourth transaction.     And this involved a property in which suburb?     And Mr Green appears to be the Estate Agent again.     Now very briefly…[intervenes].     They’re not too far away, I know because I stay near…[intervenes].     They ordinarily would have been entailed two separate Estate Agents belonging to the same company, they’re not too far apart.     Yes Ms Ngoye.     Yes.     Now this is Mr Smith…[intervenes].     The Trustee.     Then at paragraph 21.42 the details of who signed the offer and so on are set out, could you please summarise theposition for the Chairperson?     And then what happens thereafter?     And after it was rejected?     Now in the offer to the – by the minor property Trust it was subject to payment of the deposit of R2.4million and the purchaser obtaining a bond of R9.6million, is that correct, that appears at paragraph 21.41?     And when the offer was made for R13.5million what happened to the bond finance clause?    And an important point is, it’s no longer subject to a bond being approved.      Then there is a development on the 3 r d of March Mr Ngoye, what was that?     The previous offer was from the Trust.    Who is this new offer from?     So Mr Montana is now substituted for the Trust as the offeree?     And then – now in relation to this – to that offer certain payments were made and these are reflected in paragraph 21.46, what were those payments?     Alright and then 21.47 there is still obviously an amount of R11.5million.     When is that paid?     Van der Walt. MS 
MS NGOYE:  Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Mr Mabunda.    I am sorry I think she is referring to Mr Mabunda for the first time if I am not mistaken.  Maybe she can give full names?    I –     The name escapes me Chair.    Makhensa Mabunda.    Mr Makhensa Mabunda.  Thank you Counsel.    Well it is Mr Moodley Chairperson.   I think I am having a bad day today Chair in remembering the names.  Mr…    Roy Moodley yes.  So it is Mr Roy Moodley the first one and the second is Mr Mabunda those are the two gentlemen I referred to in my evidence.    That is correct Chair.    Well yes in relation to Mr Moodley’s companies we havegot you know other matters that have not necessarily been referred to here.  One of the companies that Mr Moodley is associated with and is a director of is the Royal Security Company and I do know that in relation to that specific company there is current litigation happening.  That company provides security for PRASA and I think it is a well-known issue that the security contract is with PRASA taking PRASA to court.  So Royal Security is one of those companies.    Siyangena is the big one Chairperson.  Siyangena Technologies is the big one where Mr Moodley you know is also involved.    Also yes.  Siyangena is not the …    It is Mr Roy Moodley and …    No.    His son was Strawberry Worx.    The advertising portfolio.    So he basically is more involved in this one, the Siyangena Contract.    And the Prodigy one.    His name does come up Chairperson.    Yes quite a bit.  There is Mr Ganjo (?).   There is Mr Montana himself.    And…    That is correct Chair.    The witness is familiar with who the directors are.    Yes Chair there is – there is – in fact if I can clarify that?    There is a company that was paid by Siyangena that is associated with Mr Roy Moodley.    And I will come to that Chairperson in a moment.    Correct Chair.    Siyaya is Mr Makhensa Mabunda.    Yes.    It is R500 million Chairperson.  Chair I must also say that this was also picked up you know when the media brought this to the attention of PRASA.   So the investigations that we conducted did not pick up this.  This was an issue that was picked up in the media but however PRASA then incorporates this issue in relation to the (indistinct) you know submission and it is included in there.    Chairperson the dispute between PRASA and Siyangena is around you know payments of monies that Siyangena says it is owed by PRASA.  But where PRASA wants to review and set aside all the contracts that had been concluded with Siyangena.  So we would like that – those contracts to be set aside and as part of those contracts there have been arbitration proceedings that have been brought by Siyangena in relation to their payments.    Okay the court.      For the review.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Yes I am Chairperson.   Chairperson this is the application that was brought by PRASA in relation to the Siyangena contracts applying for the review thereof.    Chair there is quite a number of contracts that – that are involved in this matter.  In fact you know I would be referring to phase 1 and phase 1 extension of the contract and then there was phase 2.  So effectively there is about four and the amendment that was also introduced in – in you know in the proceedings that we found out about when we were going to court.  So the first part of the Siyangena where Siyangena was involved as a sub-contractor that contract is not isdispute.  It is only in relation to where there were extensions of that contract which were – did not follow procedure that are in dispute.  So we have got in respect of that the extension of the pilot phase which is the extension of what was done in the (indistinct) cup period and then the 2010 Soccer World Cup as well.  You know the process that was followed in appointing Siyangena in respect of that.  And then also the extension to that contract as well as well as the first – the second phase which we call the second phase where again Siyangena was appointed to you know work on our stations in relation to the ISAMS contract.  And the final one is the amendment, the addendum which we– I – we only saw for the first time Chairperson when Siyangena took us to court.  When we had requested that they stop working on PRASA had requested that they stop working on our sites.  They took us to court applying for an interdict.  And that is when we became aware of the other addendum in relation to their contracts.    That is correct Chair.    That is fine Chair.    Yes Chair I had to because in my first affidavit the one that I signed on the 14 April the one we were dealing with yesterday I do make reference you know to the Siyangena companies and the litigation that PRASA is involved in.  So I needed to do the supplementary affidavit so that I can deal further with the – the issues that PRASA raise in the Siyangena application.  So this is why there is this supplementary affidavit which I have made.    Sorry Chair.  I have got it Chair.   Sorry Chair annexure to?    I do Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  Chair the – the application papers in PRASA’s review application are – you know are part of the bundles that have been put before the commission.  And the purpose of this affidavit is to refer to specifics in – in the main affidavit of Siyangena that PRASA has highlighted.  You know in relation to the Siyangena applications.    Chairperson the review application that is now before the courts is the second review application.  PRASA had applied before to review the contracts but because of the 180 Rule in terms of PAGA we – we were obviously not successful in that regard and when the concourt decided on the (indistinct) case you know referring to issues of legality PRASA saw it fit to then go back to court to then issue the second review application.    That is correct Chair.    Doctor Popo Molefe was still the Chairperson of PRASA at the time so he made that application Chair. He signed the paper for the application.    I had to make the founding affidavit Chairperson in my capacity as the Head of Legal and that is why my name is on the papers.    The application Chairperson is to review and set aside the contracts that had been…    Have reviewed and set aside.  We are learning as we go along Chair.  Those contracts of Siyangena that I highlighted Chairperson before.    Sure.  Chair there was – the processes that are required to be followed in you know appointing suppliers in relation to these contracts were not followed.  So effectively you know there was no authority to enter into these contracts and we did not comply with the Section 217 of The Constitution in terms how matters of you know Procurement need to be dealt with.  Our own Supply Chain processes were flouted in relation to how these contracts were entered into.   There is the PPPFA as well which obviously was also not complied with.    That is correct Chair.    I will come back to those – to those Chair.    Yes Chair.  Chairperson in 2009 you know during the Confederations Cup Process PRASA in fact appointed two construction companies Enza and Rainbow Construction to assist in the development of two stations.  This was the Nazarec station as well as the Doornfontein station.  And in that process this was handled by Intersite.  You will recall Chairperson I said that Intersite was a subsidiary of PRASA.  At the time Intersite was Intersite Property Management Services of PRASA and it ran with that process of appointing those suppliers.  And those suppliers appointed Siyangena as their sub-contractor.  So as far as we are concerned there is no issue with that contract.  I think it was important to highlight it so that you know there is context as how Siyangena then is involved in relation to the other matters.  The second issue Chairperson that is being challenged is thatimmediately after that (indistinct) process PRASA again you know gave about seven of our stations to be developed to Siyangena without following process.  This is – this is one which we call the Pilot Phase.  Effectively the extension of the Pilot Phase.  So you – what we are actually saying Chair is that in relation to that particular contract no process was followed.  In fact this is one of those matters that was dealt with by the Public Protector who also found that there was no processes followed procurement-wise SCM was flouted and so on.  So you know that is the other contract that we wish to review.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    And Chair the other contract that we wanted to review is what I refer to as the Phase 1 of the tender that Siyangena was appointed for.  And in…    I need assistance Chair.    I think – I am not sure if I have got these files properly.    SS7.  Will you help me?  May I ask Counsel are you referring to the affidavit?    The supplementary affidavit?    Okay.  Not confuse myself because referring to theapplication ...[intervenes]       Okay, so we deal with the supplementary one?      I am with you.      Yes Chair, the extensions I thought I said that the extensions were obviously not – did not follow process in terms of you know what needs to be done when procurement of services is required, so they were irregular indeed and this was what was found.     In paragraph 9.      Okay.  First it is not procurement, second Siyangena had not been the original contractor but only a sub-contractor, the extension has no legal basis because there was no privity of contract between Sengena and/or Intersite or PRASA so effectively Chair in the CONFED Cup Sengena is a sub-contractor and then the extension to that pilot Siyangena is appointed even though they were sub-contracted to the first, so they were not even a party to those contracts that were entered into with PRASA in relation to the CONFED Cup stations.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.    It doesn’t happen like that.      That’s correct Chair.      In relation to the extension Chairperson PRASA was thecontracting party.      Well Chair these stations belong to PRASA at the end of the day you know so effectively PRASA would be contracting party.   I guess when it went to Intersite, Intersite was the property management portfolio of PRASA, there again you know the rationale of taking these contracts through to Intersite was also something that was an issue Chairperson.      Chairperson the Public Protector dealt with this in the Derailed Report, there’s two Derailed Reports, so the first derailed report that I guess Mr Malefa was referring to, that’s the one I am referring to, so the Public Protector had – you know was forwardedinformation dealing with this particular contract.     That’s correct Chair.    So effectively what happened Chair with the Public Protector PRASA gave the Public Protector information not in respect of the stations that were expended so – and that is why the Public Protector then refers to an amount of R1.9billion.  That amount in fact was an amount in relation to a contract that was concluded in the Phase 1 of the transactions that we concluded with PRASA so there was that youknow misrepresentation that was made to the Public Protector by PRASA and that is why she makes that finding, but when you look at what the Public Protector was given to deal with is the extension which she found to be irregular.      That is correct Chair.      No it was not Chair.      That is correct Chair, that’s right.      I will come to that one Chair.    I am not actually sure what the number is, we could never pick up what the number is of the seven, it ranges between 800million Chair and so on.     It is less than, it definitely is because this increase I mean extension related to seven stations.     So the other one of one billion is more stations.     That’s correct.      Chairperson in this paragraph I highlight in respect ofthe Sengena proposal how Mr Gantshu, I have referred to Mr Gantshu before, had indicated you know to Mr Montana that you know Sengena’s price was too excessive it didn’t comply really with the specifications that we required you now for the gates that we were looking for and also the gates that Sengena was going to provide to PRASA were not suitable, and he raises these issues in any event in relation to that extension.      What page counsel?      167.      No, I don’t have it, I think I am not looking at the right document.     Did you say SS7?      I do.      It’s paragraph 17.6 Chairperson.      He sent an email to Mr Montana and in that paragraph3 he says after interrogating the operation methods and comparing with other install gates elsewhere in the world it turns out that these gates were not suitable.He goes on in paragraph he said in our efforts to centralise this procurement we approached ESS.      ESS is a group of companies – is part of a group of companies that belong to TMM Holdings.  Now TMM Holdings was the main company and Siyangena and ESS were subsidiaries to that company.   It says to provide PRASA with a quotation to supply all the 10 stations.  It turned out that their gates are fully imported and very expensive.  So he says that in that letter and then the third issue that he raises is that in an unnumbered paragraph of that letter we referredto he says that they were not budgeted for in the original scope.      Well in the supplementary Chair I state that following that telephone call which – with Mr Montana that Mr Guntsha made you know he requested Mr Montana to approve the extension, so even though you know those issues were there he still made the request for the extension to be approved.      Yes of course, yes it was the telephone call that he hadhad with Mr Montana.      Chairperson because before you know the letter that he writes he highlights all these issues and you know after making the call to Mr Montana you know based on what he said there was a change of heart.     It is just part of the evidence that we were able to get Chairperson in relation to the matter.     From the investigations Chairperson.     Yes, Mr Gantsho yes with reference to the papers Chair that telephone discussion.     Chair perhaps I must also state that because this matter is before Court, obviously we’re just bringing it to the Commission just to highlight the irregularities that are there and this was the subject of the forensic investigation that was conducted, so a lot of the information that is available to PRASA in relation to these matters was obtained through the forensic investigation.     Chairperson that paragraph reads that Mr Gantsho refers to a telephone discussion with Mr Montana during which Mr Montana advised him that the contract with Siyangena for the extension on the basis that Siyangena was contracted and installing similar systems at NASREC and Doornfontein, stations under the Intersite contract.  So this is information that we were able to piece together so in his email I guess he speaks to it.      Well three days later Chairperson you know Mr Montana approves the request, but he approves it subject to you know the matter being referred to finance for budgetary purposes.      Chairperson these matters were not budgeted for, in fact one of the executives that was responsible for the strategic asset development side of – within PRASA –raised a number of questions.     It was Mr Piet Sibola.      In paragraph 17, 16 Chairperson.      16.      Chairperson Mr Sibola raised issues around you know non-compliance for instance with the CIDB process and that Siyangena did not comply with it, you know raised the issues around the procurement process and raised the issues of there not being budget, in relation to this matter and also you know the fact that this type of contract would be a BBB contract which would warrant PRASA to comply with legislation really in relation to entering in these types of contract.      That’s correct.      Chair the concerns were raised at Head Office, at PRASA, but however because these were not finalised at PRASA it was then decided to refer the matter to Intersite which is a subsidiary of PRASA so that decision making process was then removed from PRASA itself and given to Intersite for Intersite to continue with the process.      Well Chair I mean clearly there was no support you know of this particular contract you know at PRASA and I guess in my observation really when one looks at this is around the fact that you know because processes were not going to be followed somebody else must deal with it, so it was trying to move away from really having to deal with the issues that were raised by people at PRASA and giving in to Intersite because the instruction to Intersite could then be coming from Head Office.     Yes I do Chair.       That’s correct Chair.      That’s correct Chair.      I think it is Chair, you know if it doesn’t work here move it there, and allow those ones to continue with it, because I think for me also what I understood is that you know Intersite being a subsidiary and you will recall I did indicate that Mr Montana was the Chairperson at Intersite, you know and the fact that challenging Mr Montana wasreally an issue at PRASA, you know so moving those things across to Intersite, the instruction across to Intersite would have then you know meant that he has also you know ...[indistinct] over them to deal with the contract.     Well we’ve got a Mr Jabulani Sendani who worked at Intersite, so he then made the submission you know for these contracts, for this process to be concluded at Intersite but we had an – and had requested a Mr Kulu Nxuba to approve these contracts, the submission of these contracts for on statement to the Group CEO. When Mr Nxuba refused to do that, he refused on the basis that the amount involved was even about you know the CEO of Intersite and he needed permission from the Board of Intersite.     No Chair there was no – we couldn’t find anything that showed that you know the Board even granted permission for these contracts to be concluded.     That’s correct Chair.     Well the contracts were entered into, Sengena was then you know “given the tender” and they proceeded with the stations.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair Mr Gantsho was the one that was really championing you know this matter, so he was the one that you know was making sure that this – as you recall he spoke to Mr Montana and convinced Mr Montana to allow PRASA to enter into these agreements, so one could safely say that because he championed this process and that’s why there’s a lot of reference to him in the documentation.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     This is what we call phase one of the projects Chair.     It also turned to be a once again a contract that was given to Siyangena in relation to 69 stations of PRASA.    Well no Chair, remember the – yes, yes you are correct, you are correct, so it’s the nine that happened, because the two was Nasrec and Doringfontein and then the seven was the one that related to the extension of the pilot phase and this one was phase one, it was an extension of yes those two, so the 69 included that seven that was referred to above.     Yes.     That’s correct.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes Chair if you look at it, so ...[intervenes]      That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Well ...[indistinct] and Rainbow Chair were the companies that appointed Siyangena so they basically fell off the radar, one Siyangena you know was then introduced into the ...[intervenes]     Yes Chair.     No it was not involved Chair.     So those two companies were not involved at all, once Siyangena came to the fore Siyangena became the main player with PRASA.     Chair in relation to Phase one the CPO at the time, the Chief Procurement Officer at the time was a gentleman by the name of Mr Chris Nbata, he then gave instructions to a senior manager in the procurement space, Ms Mathiso Moshode to have that meeting with eight companies that had been identified to participate in this next phase of the project, so there was a briefing session that was held with eight companies that had been identified, and that is how the start of Phase one you know comes about.     No it was not Chair because you know when the – what we picked up was when those eight companies were in the meeting naturally they asked for an RFP, a request for proposal document, andwhen Ms Moshode, remember Ms Moshode is given instructions by the boss to say this is a meeting, go chair this meeting and with these eight companies in relation to this next phase of the project, so when she enquires or they, the companies that had been invited, enquires about the document, the RFP whether it was issued or not, and when Ms Moshode, because she wouldn’t have known, enquired whether there was an RFP document it came out that there clearly wasn’t an RFP document that was present, so from a process perspective Chair it just shows that you know no process was followed in that respect, that’s not how you do these type of transactions.    That is correct Chair.    I cannot remember Chair how that invitation came about, so I am not really ...[indistinct] to that.      Well Chair the normal process would be to invite people, you know you advertise the tender so that you can have participants you know coming through and responding to the tender that you wouldhave invited, you would have you know advertised but because there was no tender that was advertised so we didn’t have the RFP that those suppliers, the eight were looking for, so there were stages missing in the process.     Ms Mashudi then goes to Mr Gantshu to ask for the RFP.     Well Mr Gantshu then asked Ms Mashodi to actually request those companies that had been invited to propose a bestsolution for PRASA, so once again you can see things are done you know backward, they are not done properly, so in that process that’s where you then ask the companies to you now propose a best solution for PRASA, you just don’t do things like that.     That is correct Chair.     It is not compliant Chair, it does not comply with our processes, our SEM processes, so clearly from that prospective thatprocess as granted.      They do produce the solutions Chair and a bid evaluation committee is then set up to evaluate the responses that came from these companies, effectively they sat for two days in December 2010.   Chair I think one of the things that one must mention, which is important, is that you will recall this particular process was intended to deal with those stations for the 2010 World Cup and when you look atwhen it happened, this thing happened long after the 2020 World Cup had finished.     That’s correct, that’s from the bid evaluation committee, so from a process perspective after receiving the documentation the bid evaluation will then evaluate the responses that come from the respective bidders.     June 2010.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct, in terms of also my following procedure, but the argument that could be put forward was there was urgency around the person, that’s how you knew to confine the process to eight companies.     But when you look at what then happened it clearly did not serve the purpose of dealing with the stations that were required for the 2010 walk-on.    Yes Chair I think that was the ultimate intention, to proceed anyway with this but also Chair I think from a process perspective within PRASA the planning has got to be done properly, the budgeting has got to be done properly for this type of work to be undertaken.     And none of that you know had happened and that’s we still have partially done.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Both points Chair.     That’s correct.     Chairperson the BEC had decided to proceed with the with – with the appointment of Siyagena and they would have to refer that to the BEC you know for recommendation then to Mr Montana and then to the Board.      Well Mr Montana at paragraph 21 I did show that this is when the BAC the BEC sat but I guess when the recommendation was given to Mr Montana he decided he does not want to proceed with – with the process anymore and once again you know it shows in the papers that Mr Gansho you know was relentless.  He just effectively assured the team not to be discouraged and he would do something about it.       It is angena Chair.        That is correct Chair.       Well Chair effectively the discussions that were held between Mr Montana and Mr Gansho around that the time resulted in a change of heart, I think he was sure you know Mr Gansho that you know after speaking to Mr Montana, Mr Montana would change his mindbecause as I said initially he championed this course so I think he needed to see it to finality.       That is correct Chair.       Well it inter fears with the process Chair, you know and I cannot also explain or understand why actually after the BEC had looked at the – at the responses that came from the various bidders that Mr Montana had to be consulted, because invariably from the BEC theprocess would go to the BAC and then if it is within his limit, authority wise he would then be able to say yay or nay.  So, you know this consultation with Mr Montana after having decided that we are going to go through with this process, just did not make sense.  It just shows you that no proper processes were followed in this regard.       Of course, it is.  It is subverted    Chairperson as part of the processes as I explained from BEC which is the Bid Evaluation Committee you will go to the BAC which is the Bid Adjudication Committee it is the committee that will then work out the submission from the- from the BEC.  When the BEC- BAC sat on the 14 t h of February all of sudden there was a revival      2011 Chair that matter suddenly came back to life.  Mr Montana refuses it from the BEC side but where the BAC sits in 2011 you – you find that the period the matter had come to life because they- they made a submission to the BAC for the conciliation.      That is correct, he clearly knew what he was doing.     Chairperson the BAC had a problem dealing with the submissions that was made by the – by the BEC, a lot of questions that were asked by the BAC in fact in a nutshell you know they did not agree with the process issues are wrong, budget issues around you know why not going out to a formal tender process were raised by the BAC during that time so effectively there was no support of the submission by the BEC to the BAC and also at the time what was referred to the BAC was that there was a contest between now Siyagena and Protea a company called Protea – Protea Coin.  Now if you look at what was involved Chairperson from a pricing perspective you know it was odd that the – the – the - the submission that was made by Protea was sitting at 1.3 billion in relation to this particular transaction and but when you look and I will go into that evidence Chairperson ultimately what was awarded for Siyagena the maths – the numbers never lie.  I mean clearly Protea Coin should have been the successful party if you look at the number that was ultimately forded to Siyagena in relation to this process.       That submission was really the effectively the – the –the from the BEC to request that they consider the appointment of Siyagena.     Yes so after the BAC, the BAC would then recommend the – the – the transaction to the FCIP which is there Finance CapitalInvestment Committee of the Board so from that process it went from a subcommittee of the Board.  So that is the recommendation they would have made to the Board as the BAC     Chair yes in paragraph 23 I do point out that what was submitted to the FCIP was the proposal to Siyagena to the value of 1.9 -1.1billion rand for the entire transaction so this is what the BA –the FCIP had to consider.     Reads into the record. “Having deliberated on this submission the BAC decided not to recommend the award to Siyagena however PRASA documents show a document with a signature that purports to be that of the Chairperson of the BAC Miss Taran Ngubani in a minute of the BAC that records the decision recommending the award to Siyagena for an amount of 1.1 billion”     Once again Chair you know if it does not pass master it should not proceed.  Now if the FCIP had decided not to recommend thisparticular issue to –to-to the Board for approval because when they considered the submission they said they decided that not to recommend the – the submission they received from the BAC was that the appointment should not be made in favour of.  But what then happened Chair I guess I must continue, and I refer to this minute of that was purported and I say purported because [intervenes].     That is correct Chair.     So when the BAC said because of the issues they had raised and the concerns that came from that meeting they decided not to recommend it to the BAC and that is how I refer to this minute which is purportedly signed by Miss Taran Ngubani because there were issues around that minute because also that minute came long after the matter was referred to the FCIP by Mr Mbata.     They do Chair, they make [intervenes].    The minute of the meeting Chairperson according which - according to the evidence we have was not even signed at the time by the Chairperson.  This is Miss Taran Ngubani and what became evident you know through the investigation process was it was very clear that the BAC does not agree that this process must be completed.  So you know and that is why I talk to the purported minute that was now signed that had a signature that was signed by Miss Taran Ngubani which she obviously then you know objected to and said it was not her signature as part of theinvestigation process that we did.  So clearly from the process perspective the BAC had decided we are not going to recommend this thing to – to -to the FCIP.     Of the BAC ...[intervenes].      That is correct Chair.     Well we have got a copy of those minutes Chair and there was a record a recording of [intervenes].     That is it      It is very clear.     It was very clear     That is correct Chair.     By the Chairperson, ja.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That is what Miss Taran Ngubani effectively says in – in another proceeding where she was asked to explain you know the existence of that minute.  She indicated her signature was forged and she had never signed that minute.     Well Chair I do not think it went further than that because as part of the –the –the process that PRASA was conducting at the time. Miss Taran Ngubani then decided not to you know proceed with the hearings [intervenes].     And to resign.  So PRASA did not follow through and check up on that valid- the validity of that signature so we did not do it.     That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair this matter and everything that has transpired as far as you know the –the -the mallard ministration of this and noncompliance with processes has been reported.     It would be fraud as well and so on yes.     It was reported Chair.     Well Chair there has not been much really that has come from the Police side in relation to the matters that we have referred toyou know through PRECCA you know for instance matters to the Hawks and I cannot remember if Doctor Motana gave evidence to the fact that you know  [intervenes].     I mean Doctor Molefe gave evidence to the fact that a lot of work that was done and referred for investigation there was no traction really effectively to that.  And that is why he then had to also you know sue the DCPI for –for work not done.     That is correct Chair.     Chair perhaps I can help by saying that in the –the disciplinary proceedings that Miss Taran Ngubani had to go through.  She makes an allegation that her signature was forged by Mr Chris Mbata that is what she alleges in that proceeding [intervenes].     and perhaps maybe the papers relating to that proceeding maybe helpful.     As well as the commissions so that you can see what the Chairperson of the BAC says.     Well I guess Chair during the proceedings Miss Ngubani really because Mr Mbata had played a major role really in also submitting these papers to the FCIP even after knowing that the BAC had not approved these things.  The submission that she believed that the only person that could have done that was Mr Mbata.    It would have to go to the FCIP Chair.  So maybe I could also put some light into – into effectively what had happened.  The 14t h of February the BAC sits and does not recommend this thing in fact they raise a whole lot of questions and the expectation would be Mr Mbata would go back to the BAC after having resolved the issues that wereraised by the BAC but this did not happen.  Three days later on the 17 t h of February you know the FCIP sits and Mr Mbata then submits this proposal to the FCIP for recommendation to the Board but you know it had not been approved there and there was not a further meeting of the BAC that would have allowed Mr Mbata to do that but what we found is that three days later on the 17 t h this matter sits before the FCIP.     FCIP.     That is correct Chair.     The BAC.     That is correct.      That will raise ...[intervenes].      That is it because [intervenes].     That is correct.    It cannot proceed.     Because the BAC said no.      That is correct Chair.     Ja that is what would have to had happened because the BAC says no.     And raises questions.    Tell us where the battered is for this.     And you know why have we not gone out to tender for [intervenes].     Such a big transaction he must have had to satisfy those issues first before he takes it to the FCIP.     It would have to Chair.     It would have to.     That is correct Chair.     Yes.     Chair this is the issue of that minute.  Remember when theChairperson of the BAC signs off on a minute that – that supports the appointment of -of -of Siyagena then you know it give credence to the matter being referred now to the FCIP.  So in the report that Mr Mbata as the CPO would make – they would have attach what transpired at the BAC and then the-the the FCIP would then consider all the information they have get given in the report that would have been prepared by Mr Mbata.     It is only explanation Chair so he - he yes.    Because otherwise the FCIP would not have [intervenes].     Ja, yes Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.     Yes Chair in fact Miss Ngubani was very vocal if you listen to the recording she just did not take it in terms of the submissions that was made before the BAC she flatly refused because she – the questionsthat you can hear from the recordings really showed that this is no the process that she was going to support.     That is correct Chair.     Chair you know the thing – the way things happened at PRASA that is simply the expectation.  You know that you satisfy yourself fully as to what as transpired but I guess in –in you know the way things work is that from the submission that was made by the BAC would not necessary also go backwards.  When it gets to the FCIP you know the FCIP will just you know saddle itself with what is before it.  I guess questions would be asked you know, you know what processes were there and so on and I guess what happened in this particular case was is that Board assumed you know that everything you know was in order but again Chair if you look at the amount of money that was involved it was anamount that was way beyond the – the -the authority of the group CEO and I think I would like to make a submission that says for that type of matter to appear before a subcommittee of a Board before it was you know taken up to tender the Board would have had to approve that this particular transaction is taken out to tender so one would have expected that questions maybe asked to say what process was followed in this regard.  I do not think that happened.     That is correct Chair.     No, it is evident Chair from what transpired that clearly thatdid not happen.     Chair the submission that was made to the BAC, right was for Siyangena to be appointed and the value of the transaction was 1.1 billion rand.  But when it went now to the FCIP the amount was increased to 1.9 billion rand.  So it was no longer that 1.1 that was shown to the BAC to consider.  So you can already see that there is no justification or explanation of why you would then have then produced an amount of 1.1 to the BAC, you then go to the FCIP and hype it up to 1.9   That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Chair the document that was placed before the BAC spoke to 1.1 so remember also that the BAC does not support the submission.    So effectively it is a new document that then contains thisnumber of 1.9.  Which would have not been taken back to the BAC because all this happened 3 days after the BAC had given a clear indication that they are not going to support this process.  So it does show that a separate new document was then created which reflected the number 1.9 which is not what was taken to the BAC.    It is 1.9 Chair.    That is correct.  Because if you look at the minutes Chair, the minute does not also capture what was in the recording.  So you can see there was alterations of things that were discussed there and it becomes evident that.  And also from the fact that Ms Tara Ngubane says, look I do not know this document it is not my signature that is on there, shows very well if it had been the minute of the BAC it would have reflected 1.1 billion because that is what was presented to them.  But because this document appears from somewhere with her signature and different information on there shows a clear misinterpretation that was then sent to the FCIP for consideration.    We got- yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes, they will be part of the documents that support the review application Chair.    Chair the other issue that comes up as part of the agenda item at the FCIP is the approval of the budget.  And what is reflected in there is an amount, for this specific project for instance in terms of the gates and security processes was an amount of 317 million that was allocated to this project, right.  So the same board considers this amount from a budgetary perspective but has approved a transaction the FCIP in fact recommends a transaction that is way above this amount that they would have considered as a budgetary amount for the MTF where this product was concerned.  So there is an anomaly there Chairperson.  Because clearly if you know that there is no budget for this you should not then entertain an amount that is greater than that which you have budgeted for.      That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I do not know if I can explain it.  It should not have happened.  I mean it is common sense I guess we won a sitting.   You have got to analyse these things properly and applying your mid you would have picked up that there is something amiss as far as this is concerned.      The matter went to the board Chair.  So from the FCIP it goes to the board because the FCIP recommends to the board which then approves.    That is correct but the minutes does not show Chair, of the board meeting Chair, does not show the amount that the board reflected.  So the minute, the board when it is taken there effectively it says to the team negotiate with Siyangena on this contract but it does not talk to the amount.   Was 1,9    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  That is the expectation that one would have had.    When you look at these things in the manner in which they are supposed to be done.    Yes Chair.      So there is a clarity all the way.    Yes Chair.    But also Chair if you look at it, it is a huge amount.  It is 1.9 ... (intervenes)    That is correct.    But the- one would have expected that there is also a requesting when did the tender go out, all those questions.    It has to have been asked.   And ja, one does not ... (intervenes)    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Ja.    That is it.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    The BEC and the BAC are the employees of PRASA.    The FCIP ... (intervenes)    Ja.  It is a subcommittee of the board.    So it is only board members.  The management that goes tothe FCIP.    Would just be for purpose of presentation the matters to the FCIP.    But they are not members of the FCIP.    FCIP.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.  It is very unfortunate Chair and I think what we picked up because of the anomalies that were happening in PRASA around the submission of documentation to the FCIP.  Because of these issues that the chairperson for instance on the FCIP is not the person that prepares the report that goes to the FCIP.  The report is prepared by the CPO theChief Procurement Officer and the chairperson of the FCIP does not have sight of what then is referred to the FCIP by the CPO.  So there is that missing link.    That- well, it should have been- that is not how it was.    That is it.    That is it.  But it did not happen that way at PRASA.  It was the Chief Procurement Officer who prepared a report to the FCIP.    No Chair, at PRASA in stead ... (intervenes)    The CPO.    Well we then went back to the chair of this of the-    The BAC.   They would not necessarily agree.  I remember one matter yes when the chair of the BAC said, but that is not the report that I would have sanctioned as the chair of the BAC to go to the FCIP.  So that continuity was just not there.  So you have one person being in control of a particular process but you have another preparing a report.    No it is correct.    That is correct Chairperson.    It is the report of the CPO.    Ja.    Well that is how we did things Chair.    That is correct Chair.   Well he- no.  He makes submissions.  So he would be the one that ... (intervenes)    That is it Chair.    Yes.    That is right Chair.    He would have attended the BAC meeting Chair because ... (intervenes)    That is it.  Because the questions that are posed would be posed to him.  So in this respect he was present at the BAC meeting.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  So effectively there was no open tender process.  And there was not even a request to deviate from the open tender process.  There was no RFP and there were no evaluation criteria because that would be stated in the tender documentation.  So effectively bidders were asked to really make, I say a shot in the dark, and hope that PRASA would be happy with it.  And that is why I then earlier on refers to Protea Chair.  Protea Coin submitted a response, their amount was 1.3 billion.  Now if you had then looked at the amount that was finally awarded 1.9, the award should have gone to Protea Coin because they were the cheaper ones.  But it did not it went to Siyangena.    Protea- I did not mention that Protea Coin tendered the price of 1.3 billion which is must cheaper than Siyangena.  It lost because of a funding model that apparently is part of the submissions thatSiyangena made, it provided a funding model.  But that funding model was not a requirement that everybody knew they had to give this part of the responses they made to PRASA.    That is 1.9 Chair.    Yes.  Because that was ultimately the amount that sat at the board at the FCIP.   BAC.     And BAC.    That is correct.    All the prices would be there Chair.    Yes, they would have had to be there.    Because you- as part of the reporting you then show who came where and so.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is right Chair.    That is correct Chair.    3, yes.    No Chair.    No.      It is not reflected on the minutes.  One would expect youwould see that in the minutes but the deliberations did not factor that.    Ja.    This was the funding model that I referred to Chair.  So as part of their submission.   Remember at the time PRASA was saying we do not even have money to run with this process?    So they prepared a funding model which would then assist PRASA in carrying out this particular transaction.    Protea Coin did not.    And with that benefit that they had furnished to PRASA, they were the ones that were considered.    Because Protea Coin really loses on the basis that there is no funding model.   And it- when you think about it, it does make sense that PRASA would have wanted somebody to suggest how we are going to fund this thing.  Because the evidence that has been given shows that there was no budget really for this so this funding model would have assisted the organisation.    That is correct Chair.    Well in the end it did not happen Chair.  When the whole process started it was clear that PRASA does not have money to undertake this project from a budgetary perspective.  So Siyangena then proposed to say, we will give you a funding model that would then assistyou guys in terms of carrying out this project.  But what happens in the end is that that funding model does not even play a role in fulfilling that contract that PRASA had entered into with Siyangena.  So they did not give money to PRASA as an example to assist PRASA with carrying out the project so that PRASA could then pay back at the time that they had the necessary monies.  So it was a proposal that was made by Siyangena right up front.  Remember this process is not proper Chair.    Well it is around how they would assist PRASA in funding the project.  So they would pay.  They would effectively ... (intervenes)    That is it.  And then they would be paid by PRASA when PRASA has got the sufficient funds.    That is correct.    Pay back.    That is correct.  Because at that time it was very clear that there is no money for this project.   Yes.  And that is one of the issues.  Remember Mr Gunjo had raised it up front that it had only been on the budget for this.    And when you also look at the NTF amount that was put to the board of 317 million, it is way less than that was required for this project.    I am sure.  Yes.    Well Chair I do not think I would ... (intervenes)    Venture into that.    But when you look at what the BAC was settled on, it was an amount of 1.1 billion.    So that is what ... (intervenes)    That is correct Chair.  Ja.   Yes.    That is correct Chair.   We did not have the money.    Yes, correct Chair.    Ja.  That is correct.    Because the basis on which Siyangena really is the successful party is on the funding model.    That is why I say when you compare the price of Protea Coin with that of Siyangena, ultimately that was presented for approval.  Siyangena was much higher than Protea Coin.  The expectation that youthough had is the Protea Coin would then succeed because it was at 1.3 billion and Siyangena’s price as reflected in the documentation that was sent to the FCIP was 1.9.  So the funding model would have helped been an advantage that the- Siyangena had.  But also remember Chair, the Protea Coin was not asked to provide a funding model so they did not know that they had to even provide a funding model.  The issue of the funding model was only known by Siyangena.    Yes Chair.    No, Protea Coin was not aware that it had to provide a funding model in respect of its contract.    The CPO together with Mr Gunjo.    Ja.    No.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  In terms of Treasury rules PRASA is a – is a Schedule 3B and take for instance Transnet is a Schedule 2B.  So issues pertaining to public and private partnership PPP are specified to the Treasury Regulations in relation to entities falling within the Schedule 2B aspect and not 3B.  You know so PRASA couldnever enter into public private partnerships.  Because also the process is very tedious.  I think when one looks at the regulations from National Treasury you understand that it is not – is not an easy process to follow and it is a process that really is run then by National Treasury because there is a lot of things that are involved in that process.  So PRASA is not allowed to enter into PPP’s.    Well effectively yes you know and that is why Mr Sebola was concerned you know.    These are the minutes Chair from the BAC that one speaks about.  You know the fact that the BAC minutes had not been signed but you then have a copy of the minutes that are now signed and this is obviously the allegation that Ms Tara Ngubane makes to say look I do not know anything about those minutes.    But the excerpt that gets then prepared is prepared on the basis of the resolution of the Board having approved R1.9 billion.  This is what I am referring to and this is the evidence we were able to pickup you know when we did the investigation.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  I explained that you know say it is317 it is R1.9.  I mean if you look at it in totality it does not make sense that you would approve a transaction of R1.9 billion when you have only a budget of R3.17.    I guess one could explain it that way Chair if you really think about it because it just does not make sense that you – you know your budget is about 3. – 317 million and yet you approved a tender of R1.9 you know one would think that they also relied on this funding model that Siyangena makes.    No I – I – that is not reflected Chair – it does not – the minutes do not show that.    Well Chair I do not know and maybe I should say also you know from a regulatory process.    PRASA just cannot go out and request loans or enter into those type of transactions without the necessary approvals being granted by National Treasury being one of the – the institutions that would have had to consider PRASA you know asking for a loan.  The reality is that PRASA is a subsidised entity obviously gets its money from you know government and it is – so there was restrictions really around borrowings and so on.  So PRASA would have had to comply.  So I do not know you know when and how PRASA would have been able to justify that loan that it had made.    It is a loan ja.  I cannot recollect Chair if – if – but we can check it.  We can check what…    That was even in…    No I cannot recall seeing it Chair.    Protea Coin.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    Hm.    Yes Chair.  I guess well we can find the document Chari.    From the model.    There is a lot of paper.    That is involved in this (indistinct).    But Chair when you look at the – how the matter unfolded and how the payments were made you know monies was coming out of PRASA to pay this. So effectively you know in relation to this first phase of the project PRASA had paid a substantial amount of money out of its own coffers to Siyangena.  So then when you look at it really at the end of the day this funding model did not even benefit PRASA because it still paid you know.    No that is correct.    The management ja.    That is correct Chair.    There was another twist to Phase 1 Chair.  So Phase 1 was then extended again where from 69 twelve more stations were then included.  So effectively Siyangena just got given twelve more stations to say add on.  And the bat as well the expectation would be you need to follow procedure you know it (indistinct).  It was just an addition to the 69 that it had already had.  So once again you can safely see that we were not doing things in accordance with how they are supposed to be done.    It is 69 plus 12 – 70.    Is it?    Okay Chair.   It is 81 Chair.    Yes.    It was R350 million Chair for the additional twelve.     R1.9 billion.    R2. – ja.  R2.2 billion.    I just (indistinct) because it was two stations.    At the time you know the amount would not even have been…    I cannot remember exactly what the amount was but it was not (Chair speaking over Ms Ngoye).    It was only two stations that were required to be done at the time.    Ja.    It is around the procedure Chair.  You do not just extend.  Even if there was a tender say you do not extend the scope of the contract without following process again.  So you know naturally it just does not work like that.  You have to – if you want to extend the scope of the contract you would have to take it out to tender again.  So this was not – this was not done.    He was part of it Chair.  So he would have…    So he was part – so effectively between the Chief Procurement Officer and the Group CEO.    You know all these things would be sponsored and they would have to be done.    It had to be both.    Because – that is it Chair yes.    No I was at Intersite Chair.    At Intersite ja.    Intersite I was at 2011 until 2014 – August.    And then I went across to PRASA.    PRASA is in the…    2011.    Yes.    But I would not have been involved because …    And also at the time Chair Intersite was no longer doing what the previous Intersite was doing.    So in this – in my case Intersite was an asset investmentcompany.    And the focus was different.    Well if I recall Chair I mean there was a time when Mr Mbatha indicated that he had been at PRASA for more than 20 years.    Ja.  So he had been at PRASA for a long time.    No I would not know Chair.    I do not know.    Of course.    Of course Chair.    Of course.    Yes.    No Chair.  You know I mean this was just an additional twelve stations to – to Siyangena.  If it went back Chair there would obviously be – have been you know concerns that would have been raised you know by the – by the BAC and the DEC again.  It should have been you know especially where the BAC is concerned considering that they have not approved.    The procedure.    Well if there was to be an extension Chair of – of the contract again we talk to the scope increase you know and this issue isalso regulated by National Treasury to say you cannot vary the contract and increase the scope to more than a particular percentage of the contract.  So one would have expected that it would have had to go back to the BAC and then to the SCIP for consideration.    That too Chair.      You do not know if…    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.  The value of the extension Chair would play a role as to whether the matter goes back to procurement – a process to advertising or not.  So…    Because in terms of – in terms of the Treasury Regulations.    If I recall I think the percentage is increased now to 15%.  So if at the time it was more than 10% of the value of the contract the variation then you would have to go out to tender.  So that – thecontract value and what it is that would have been paid here would determine.    Whether that process would have to be followed.    So it depended (inaudible).    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  Mr Montana’s authority in terms of the delegations of authority was limited to R100 million.  It would had you know things done properly and gone to the – to the Board for approval.    No it did not go to the Board Chair.    That is correct Chair.  I mean if you look at how things were done you know it was like does it matter?  Let us go ahead and do it.    Sorry what reflects it?  What is it reflecting?   I do not want to venture into that Chair because I am not sure.  I have not necessarily looked at the – the financials so I did not want to say yes they were.  I cannot recall if the amount was reflected.    That is correct Chair.    That is right Chair.    That’s correct Chairperson.      Chairperson, phase two is about another award, this time the number of stations was 161 number of stations that were awarded to Siyangena.  So phase two deals with the process to appoint Siyangena, ultimately, as the preferred bidder.     161 Stations that…[intervenes].    Separate from phase one.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Chair.     It was also not a smooth process Chair, however, in respect of phase two at least this time we had a RFP that was issued as part of the tender process, so the starting point, I suppose was, you know, kosher in terms of how things are supposed to be done.     No once again, it was not a fair process Chairperson because instead of PRASA, in its request, for suppliers to tender asking for functionality it specified a particular brand that the suppliers or the bidders would have had to comply with or be able to support andthat particular brand was a brand only associated with Siyangena.     I find it difficult Chairperson for anybody to say that, the processes are clear, we had a supply chain management, you know policy that required us to do things in a particular way and anybody, especially in that area, because it was a procurement area, would thenwant to come and say, you know we’re negligent, would not be truthful.     That’s correct Chair.    Yes Chair.      It’s all the [indistinct] that really were present Chairperson, you know, the simple issue of saying put something out totender and let it be competed upon properly, we all understand, you know, as a State owned entity and our governance in relation to what we should do in relation to tenders, Section 217, no-one can say who works for a State owned enterprise, that they don’t understand the provisions of Section 217, fair processes, equitable and so on.  You can’t say that, you know, so if you decide to then have a process that does not comply with that which is rigged, in my opinion, you know, then clearly you know exactly what you’re doing.     No Chair, there wasn’t, there was no RFP issued, you know, there was no open tender issued.  Even when, you know, those eight suppliers were called into that meeting, when they themselves asked for a RFP we couldn’t produce one.  We then said to them, develop something that would work for PRASA, you know, how does one explain that any further.     No Chair there was just no justification and there was not even urgency, you know, at least in the case of urgency you would say, look we had to deal with things very quickly and therefore we had to – the procurement policy would have provided for that but when  you lookat, you know, the work that was done you can’t actually read urgency to that you can’t even attribute the fact that this particular company was a sole supplier was a single source, you know where in terms of the policy you would be able to do certain things and justify it.  In this respect you know, the fact that, in the phase one process you invited eight suppliers to come in.  It’s a clear indication that you appreciate that there would be competitors out there who would want to participate in an open tender process.  So I can’t see any justification from anyone within PRASA who would be able to then say, yes we had to do this because of urgency because Siyangena, for instance is a sole supplier and sole source there was just no justification for that.     Yes Chair.    That’s correct.     No I’m not aware Chair Mr Mbatha…[intervenes].     Well we did Chair, the organisation did as part of the process of dealing with consequence management and subjecting MrMbatha to a disciplinary process, that process was not completed to have allowed him to put that justification forward.  In fact, I guess because of other issues and the reasons he gave for not being able to attend the disciplinary process, you know.  An unfavourable judgement was being taken against him because he didn’t present himself to the hearing so one would not, then understand, what Mr Mbatha…[intervenes].     Correct Chair     Yes Chair.     Well Mr Montana was out of the picture at the time.     Ja.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.       That’s correct Chair.  The eight people that had been invited, but once again, I still contend that it was just selecting eight people and not necessarily putting it out, you know, as a tender process.     That’s correct Chair.     No it was not done Chair.     No Chair not in this circumstance, you know, there might be other circumstances but not this one Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     And the FCIP yes.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     The – all the amounts was above his delegations – all the amounts in relation to phase one and the extension thereof was above his delegation.     All the amounts.    Yes.     R100million Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     No Chair there were none.    Not at all.     If there was anything above his delegation of authority, even in terms of signing of contracts that are above his delegation of authority he would have been given that permission by the Board, to say, we then authorise you Group CEO to then enter into this contract after the Board would have, obviously, considered the issues and have had supported the submissions that were made to it but otherwise he just wouldn’t…[intervenes].    No.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair our policy, you know, does not support the mentioning of brands when we go out into the public requesting for tenders to be – for people to participate in our tenders.  So that issue is not there, you can’t mention a brand in a tender process because then it makes it un-competitive.     That’s correct Chair, you can’t specify a brand.    That’s correct Chair but not a brand.    Yes it was Chair, in fact, two of the bidders, you know, had a problem with it because the brands that were specified favoured Siyangena to the detriment of the other bidders.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair the way this process started, in fact, was that there was an unsolicited proposal, effectively, that was made by Siyangena in relation to phase two.  So in there it was very clear that their brands are the brands that support the Babylon and Delmaya system and that was then, what was used effectively, you know, to take the matter out to tender reflecting those two brands and it followed from the unsolicited proposal that was made by Siyangena in relation to phase two.     Well the Supply Chain Management area, in this regard the CPO, the Chief Procurement Officer at the time was a gentleman bythe name of Mr Jasapet Konghula [?], so he ran with this process, you know, from a procurement perspective.     Yes Chair.     I can’t remember the times Chair but what I know is that at the time that this particular process was involved Mr Mbatha had no longer been the CPO, Mr Konghula had confirmed the [indistinct].    No Chair, he got moved to another area within the organisation.     Well he left now because the disciplinary process that continued in his absence, found him guilty and therefore he was dismissed.     Yes Chair.     Yes.     Yes Chair.     Well he went to the CCMA Chair to challenge the dismissal, you know, so that process has still not been completed.     Yes.     That’s correct Chair.     If anything, I think Mr Mbatha, if I recall Chair Mr Mbatha was removed as the CPO perhaps end of 2011/2012.     Yes, because this process is a 2013 process, the second phase.     It’s not long ago Chair, remember this is a subject of aninvestigation so what had happened is that – because also the Public Protector had picked this up. Now as part of the remedial actions PRASA obviously had to follow consequence management processes to make sure that those people that had been identified in the…[intervenes].     It’s not…[intervenes].     It’s last year actually Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct he was the Chief Information Officer.    No Chair, it was the recent – the last Board that had the Board…[intervenes].     Ms Kwinana’s Board that initiated the disciplinaryproceedings.     And appointed a law firm to run with those processes, so it was last year.     Yes Chair.     No sorry Chair, CIO, Chief Information Officer.  So CPO being the Chief Procurement Officer…[intervenes].    No Chair CPO as the Chief Procurement Officer was around 2011/2012.     That’s correct Chair.     No he was not removed – he was removed by him as a CPO but he was not dismissed by Mr Montana…[intervenes].     That’s correct, he was removed by Mr Montana, that’s correct Chair.    Yes, sorry we’re at cross purposes.     I wouldn’t know the reasons Chair, I mean, I think the practice at PRASA was that you found ourselves being moved ever so often so one never understood the rationale of, you know, moving people, it happened to a lot of us that we were moved.  At one point, I think as employees we would make fun of the slogan of PRASA to saybe moved, referring really to the employees within the organisation.    I would say…[intervenes].     That was a parallel move.     Ja it’s got no salary increase, it was a parallel move because, you know, ja.     Because at one-point Chairperson the CPO was an Executive position right and that’s what Mr Mbatha was, he’s always been an Executive in the organisation.  When Mr Konghula came on board it was then a GM position, a General Manager position so he didnot have the same status as that of Mr Mbatha. So there were changes to the operational structure that did no place Mr Konghula at an Executive level, however, Mr Mbatha from being moved from the CPO at Executive level went to the CIO which was still an Executive appointment.     Yes I’m saying there it’s not surprisingly given that the specs were tailor made for Siyangena, it was awarded the contracted.     Oh sorry it was an urgent process Chair.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair, I mentioned earlier that the – it was an unsolicited proposal that was made by Siyangena to PRASA for the rest of the stations.  So effectively, you know, tailor making it was making it to suit the proposal that Siyangena had made.    Well the mention of the brand Chair is a give away you know, in the circumstances, because only Siyangena could support Delmaya and Babylon and therefore the other bidders were excluded from participating.     It’s a brand, it’s called Dalmaya and the one was Babylon.    I guess because they were the- they were regarded, like the OEM, the original, you know…[intervenes].     That’s it.     Ja, so they’re the ones that supported – they were the only ones that could support that brand.     It was over R2billion Chairperson.     Yes.    Yes with the inclusion of the R250.     Ja.     Over R2billion.     Yes it was 161 stations Chair.     Ja.     Yes Chair because they are the only ones.     Yes Chair.     That is correct.  That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     The brand.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct.    The discussions were happening internally.     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, the addendum was a mystery to PRASA.    Bizarre, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     I – I get you Chair.  I do.  And I think you know that is why the investigations revealed you know the amount of corruption and maladministration and all sorts that and fraud that were happening in these – in these processes.  Noncompliance with legislation and that is why at the time PRASA, the Board of Doctor Popo Molefe decided he needs to have these contracts set aside because the investigations revealed these issues that could not be explained, Chair.     Chairperson, when the Board of PRASA at the time of Doctor Molefe decide what was you know looking at these contracts wewere given an instruction by the Board to say tell Siyagena to stop working because we are not going to pay them because of these irregularities.  And Siyagena brought an interdict against PRASA, the High Court in Pretoria and as part as their papers they produced this addendum.  Now nobody at PRASA knew about the addendum.  We searched and the business unit that was managing the contract of Siyagena was not even aware that there was addendum.  We searched, you know, the documentations within PRASA looking for this addendum it was not found.  So this addendum was produced by Siyagena for the first time at the meeting, at Court in fact and we were alarmed because we didnot know what the document was for and we searched, you know, vigorously effectively to try find this document and we just could not find it in the records of PRASA.  But this document was signed by Mr Montana.     it is part of the bundle, Chair, for Court but we will have to bring it also here.     Let me just – let me just, if I am not mistaken if I recall Chair, it was April 2014.     Yes.     That is correct, chair.    That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Chair, it was effectively a type of a maintenance contract, you know, where Siyagena in relation to phase one would replace, you know, certain equipment with others because from a – from a – from a phase one I think at the time had run for a period of three years and so if Doctor. if there needed to be a change to the equipment then Siyagena would then again come in and be able to provide the maintenance.But, what we found interesting also about this addendum was that you would have expected there would be service level agreement to saythis is how you are going to do things and this is you know the process that you would follow.  We could not find that Service Level Agreement that related to the - to that addendum.  But what we understood was the requirement at the time was that PRASA will then have to pay Siyagena an amount of I think it is 10 million.     A month.  Ten million a month for those services.  So, so when Siyagena was suing PRASA through the arbitration process for monies owed it would include this ten million.     A hundred and sixty-one, Chair.     Yes.     An addendum.     Okay, of the equipment that Siyagene would have     Yes, so if it needed to be changed that is right.     So that addendum related to them having to that work.     I cannot remember, Chair.  I cannot remember.     Yes, it would have been.  Remember that the phase one project was actually near completion at the time.     And then this addendum came out.     I think it was phase one and two Chair, but I stand to be corrected I will have to check on it.     But phase one definitely.     Yes, Chair.      That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.  We saw it for the first time when Siyagena’s attorneys produced it, we knew about it.     That is correct, Chair.  When they served us the papers [intervenes].     That we had papers in support of the incident.  That is correct.     That is correct, Chair.  Definitely phase one as I say I cannot remember if it extended to phase two.    That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes, Chair.  It is possible.     Chair, that is why, you know, one is saying it was just abizarre situation we were faced with.  Especially, with the business that was managing the particular contract was not even aware that there was this addendum that related to maintenance of the equipment.  So, you know, we were all surprised to see this document and we just did not know how it came about.  You know, so it for us it was just in fact we thought that this document was created outside.     No, Chair.     I cannot remember.  Ja, I cannot remember this witness.  But definitely it was [intervenes].     That is it.  Ja.     No, no I cannot recall.  But I know that the document was all I remember Chair is that the document was signed by Mr Montana.     No, Chair.     We looked we even one of the companies that we had employed during the investigation Fax Consulting could basically - remember I spoke about our computers being imaged?  So could basically go into the information of PRASA and pull out you know anything that we requested.     It was just not there, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     No, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is what – well, that is the conclusion we came to,Chair.     Would have been found.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     To phase one because you could not have had phase two was just beginning, you know, phase one would have been the one that would require changes to their equipment.  But, ja, that is why a lot of things did not make sense when we looked at it.  Our conclusion with their investigating team and our attorneys was that there was clearly something I missed here.  It did not make sense.     Effectively, Chair.  It is correct.     That is correct, Chair.    It was premature, Chair.  You could not have made reference to phase two because in terms of, remember also one understands that there is warranty periods, you know in relation to the equipment that would have been provided to PRASA.  So, phase two - they were still in the process I mean phase two was only completed in fact last year.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     I think it was an oversight Chairperson.     I think it was an oversight.     Yes.  Ja.  I think it was an oversight.     Well, Chair the whole thing just did not make sense to us.  You know, here we are in the midst of the phase two work still being done, you know, it has not been completed and you then you know createthis addendum for purposes of phase two instead of you call it phase two but you refer to phase one which was supposed to be completed at the time.  It just did not make sense I mean I my view [intervenes].     My view is that you know in a haste you know you then do not check what it is you have put on the document.     Yes, Chair and that is why I am saying, you know because we could not make sense we could not find this document the only thing that we could deduce was that you know, things were done in a rush and therefore people did not apply their minds when they were putting thedocuments together.     Yes, Chair.     Phase one.  Ja.  Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.  Look I do not understand really what happened and if one can explain it as I said you know this is just pounced on us.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Are we talking to phase one?     No, there was no payment in relation to the maintenance.  Remember this was maintenance.  So, we did not because we did not know about this so nothing could have been attributed to the payment in relations to the maintenance.  So, the payments that was done in relation to the work that Siyagena had performed for PRASA was in relation to the contracts themselves and not the maintenance portion.     That is correct, Chair.  Well, it is purportedly.  I do not know want to say that it is concluded because I do not know.    That is correct, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     It should.     Fourteen     But it could not have started immediately, Chair.     It could not have started immediately because [intervenes].     Well, you got warranties, you know, that would help you at least with you know changing ...[intervenes].      Maintenance issues in relation to the phase one so it would then have to kick in after the warranty period lapsed.     Yes.     I do not recall, Chair.  I do not remember.     The warranties ...[intervenes].      I cannot recall, Chair.  I do not want to make submissions to that.     That is correct, chair.  I mean I will say again you know we found it interesting that this document was just produced at the time that it was produced and the fact that we could not find it and that is why I am saying Chair internally in relation to the payments for maintenance we could not find, you now, the fact that PRASA had paid for maintenance anywhere in relation to the phase one contract.  The business unit that was responsible for this contract if they knew about it would have knownthat they would have had to pay this maintenance as well but because they did not know you know there would not have been any justification from them to pay.     It was PRASA Cress.  It was the Corporate Real Estate.     No, we asked the CEO at the time was, Taran Ngubani, and she looked with her team and they did not know about it.  We asked procurement ...[intervenes].      No, when we asked, we asked as we received the document, so we went back and said we need to check ourselves whether this document exists.  We went to procurement and procurement did not have a record of the document.  We went to the business unit that wasmanaging the project to ask if they knew about this document and they did not know as well.     Yes, we did Chair.  I think we paid over 1 billion.    Yes, we had money.  We paid over 1 billion.  I think in respect of phase one at the time the Board requested us to stop paying Siyagena, we were owing Siyagena about six hundred million.     For phase one.     Ja.     That is correct, Chair.     They would have invoiced.  Definitely, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Chairperson, what happened is that in relation to phase one the contract was obviously not known so there was no submission of an invoice in relation to the maintenance of it.  What we then found out was in relation to the matters pertaining to phase 2 that in Siyangena’s invoices there would be reference to this maintenance agreement.  But obviously at the time we had put a hold, the board had put a hold on payment of these amounts to Siyangena so no monies would have been paid in relation to this addendum for Siyangena.  But they included the amount that PRASA owes them.    Mm.    We asked Siyangena to stop I think it was in 2016.    The latest 2016, yes.    It could be 2016/2017 when the board said, look based on the investigations that we have stop paying Siyangena.   So it was ... (intervenes)    2016.    2016, ja Chair.    The board of Dr Popo Molefe was still in place.    Yes after.    That is correct Chair.    No Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    The work that have been done.    Yes.  Because there was a process also Chair.    After.    After we found out.    Remember they- ja, they still bill us Chair.  They continue to bill us.    In fact, what happened Chair with the interdict, we lost the interdict and so they were allowed to continue to work.    And so, they continued ... (intervenes)    Yes.   No Chair there was not any evidence that showed that ... (intervenes)    Ja, there was not.    What I know Chair is that the CEO Mr Tara Ngubane- I meanMs Tara Ngubane when he interviewed her in relation to wanting to understand what actually transpired she indicated the thoroughness of looking at the work that Siyangena would have done before payment and they would question obviously things that they did not agree with.    So speaking to her there was no mention of the fact that this contract was in existence (indistinct).    Of course.    Ja, they would not.    No Chair.    There is no invoice Chair.    It is suspect Chair.  One wonders what could have happenedand one is thinking about the issues of once again corruption and ... (intervenes)    And all sorts.    No.  No, you cannot.  You cannot- that is why I am saying Chair it was just bazaar for us to say, now there is this other thing.      And there is this other expectation from PRASA in terms of payment requirements.    Which we did not seem to see.   We will request that Chair.    Chairperson in paragraph 39 I say in respect of all these contracts ... (intervenes)    Paragraph 39.   Of the supplementary affidavit.    I state that in all these contracts PRASA was simply not authorised to proceed with the work contemplated in phase 1 and phase 2 and the addendum.  These transactions were not budgeted for and no approvals were even obtained from the Minister of Transport.    Chairperson there is a materiality issue that applies within state-owned enterprises.  So but also ... (intervenes)    The materiality in terms of the amount of money that is regarded as material.  But what I found at PRASA Chair is that I am not sure that we are doing the materiality process correctly.  Take for example right now the materiality that has been identified in terms of the amount at PRASA is sitting at 58 million.  But then you have the authority of the Group CEO at a 100 million.    How I understand these work- these to work especially in relation to my experience from Transnet was that you would agree the materiality with the shareholder.  So anything that is above the materiality that you would have agreed with the shareholder would then have to go to the shareholder for approval.   So if you look at these amounts I mean I think at one point PRASA was sitting at 48 million as a materiality framework, a number that was included in our framework.    But the authority of the Group CEO would have been above that.  So effectively you could not have- and this is my submission Chair.  You could not have a materiality framework of a particular amount and a delegation of authority above that materiality framework.  It should not have worked like that.  And in any event, anything above a billion inrelation to what PRASA would have indicated as a materiality framework would have required the minister’s approval.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    In the materiality framework.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    And also, in terms of a PFMA Chair it would be ... (intervenes)    Yes, it would be a major acquisition from- for PRASA which have entered into these types of transactions.  So PRASA was acquiring assets that were material.    The PFMA talks to that the acquisition of a significant asset, right.    And what happens is that for you to be able to determine what is material, you agree the figure with the shareholder.    So that would be incorporated in the shareholders contractwhich in the agreement that the minister concludes with the board.  So that should the board- should an amount be above that which is agreed with the minister a PFMA would kick in.    The PFMA would kick in as well Chair.    A significant asset, yes.    Yes. And then materiality would then determine.    Really what would then be regarded as significant in the biggest scheme ... (intervenes)    Where the organisation is concerned.    It is in Section 54.    Ja, in Section 54 of the document Chair.    At the time Chair.    Ja.  Because I think we are sitting at 50 odd million rand.    They were talking about billions.  It is just too big an amount for PRASA not to engage the minister and get his approval.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I speak about Mr Gunjo Chair.    I do not know.    (indistinct)      I know the name but I forgot.    I will have to look for it Chair.    Yes.    The decisions were made by Mr Montana.   They concern both Mr Gunjo and Mr Montana Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Four property transactions Chairperson that were picked up by the investigators.    Mr Gunjo there is one property that was picked up.   That is correct Chair.    Well Chairperson these- we say they are property transactions because they are related to the houses that Mr Montana had bought at the time.  The first transaction ... (intervenes)    At the time the Siyangena contract was we were ... (intervenes)    All of it.    During those years.    So ... (intervenes)    Yes.    The investigations pick up that there is a number of contracts that property dealings the Mr Montana was involved in.  And four of these were identified and what was bazaar Chairperson about these transactions was- is it has been alluded in the affidavit, was thatyou had an attorney who at the time was a conveyer over the attorney.  One would regard him as the attorney for Siyangena.  Was the person that was assisting Mr Montana in the procurement of these contracts of these properties.  And when you look at the amounts involved Chair you would recognise that they were substantial amounts.  For instance, one of the properties was about 11 million rand.  And what the investigations picked up was that these properties were not bonded so.    The first one was.  He bought the property for a billion- not a billion, it is 1 odd million and he sold it for 6 million.  So that one ...(intervenes)    Yes.  There was one for about 11 billion ... (intervenes)    I mean million, sorry Chair, not billion.  Million.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Well Chairperson in this transaction Mr Montana, this relates to a property in Parkwood.  Mr Montana had purchased a property in 2014 for 1.8 million.  He then sells the property to Precise Trade.  NowPrecise Trade is a company where one of the directors of Precise Trade is the lawyer representing Siyangena, Mr van der Walt.    So one- the issues of conflict arise in that regard.  But also, in respect of this property it was valued at just over 3 million.    1.8    1.850 million, yes.  And then he sells ... (intervenes)    It is (indistinct) on file Chair.    On the 4 t h of July.    2008.   He pays that.    For 6.8    Yes.    For 6.8    Yes.  The company Precise Trade is a company ...(intervenes)    That is right.  Where he is a director.    Yes.    And the purchase price was 6.8 ... (intervenes)    There was a profit of 4.    That is correct Chair.    The profit for that amount was ... (intervenes)    Yes Chair.   Profit.    Yes.    The market value at the time.    The market value of the property at the time ... (intervenes)   Was 3.3 million.    Yes.  So Precise Trade bought it for much more than what was the market value.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    (indistinct)     That is correct Chair.    No, I cannot recall Chair.    Ja.    It is Precise, Precise Trade Chair.    Precise Trade Chairperson.    Is Mr van der Walt.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.  So at the time of this particular transaction that is reflected in 21.10 indicates that Mr van der Walt was the attorney for Siyangena.  And Siyangena was performing work on the phase 1 project and then to be appointed to phase 2.  So he was involved in advising Siyangena at the time but Siyangena was … (intervenes)    That is correct Chair.    At the time Chair.  Yes Chair.    Yes.    In the review application we had a Mr van der Merwe, Gert van der Merwe, representing Siyangena.    I do not know if they were together with Mr van der Walt.  But what I know is that Mr van der Merwe was the attorney and has been the attorney of Siyangena.    They were in the same company.   No, the law firm that has always represented Siyangena … (intervenes)    Was yes, represented by the lawyer Mr Gert van der Merwe.    van der Merwe was the attorney.    van der Walt was involved in assisting Siyangena.    But was not the attorney.    Yes.    In the interdict it was Mr van der Merwe that represented Siyangena.    As the attorney.    As the attorney Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Even to date.    This was a … (intervenes)    This was a sale of property at Waterkloof Pretoria Chair.    The purchase price was 10.5 million.    Well in terms of 21.15 Chair you refer that the purchase price was 10.5.  The purchase price had to be paid in cash.    Yes.  It had to be paid in cash into a trust account.    Yes.  Into a trust account of Van Rensburg Inc Attorneysupon signature of the contract.  So they were the ones that were doing the convincing of the transaction.  This particular contract lacks because Mr Montana failed to pay the purchase price.    In relation to the same property, yes Mr Montana then agreed to pay a non-refundable deposit of 3.5 million which was subsequently paid.    Yes.  So the sale agreement Chair was between Anmani represented by Ms De Beer and Minor Property Trust represented by Mr Johan Smith a trustee.  The beneficiaries of the Minor Property Trust arethe children of Mr Montana.  So the purchase price was 11 million.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct – that is correct Chairperson.    Yes.    Well it – you know.    Well this one because was – the purchaser became the trust.    And what we found out was that trust belonged to Mr Montana’s children.   So the connection that is made.    Is that you know it was in relation to him.    The R3.5 her paid.  On 201.18 Chairperson on page 363 we indicate that the balance of the R7.5 million was paid by Precise Trade.    Yes Chair.    It lapsed because he could not raise the funding.    When it was revised.  The transaction was revised.    Yes.    That is right.    With his children’s trust.   That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  And then at the top the first agreement was forR10.5.    And then this one.    Went up to R11 – yes.    That is right.    Chair.    These (indistinct) are very complex Chair and I am going to speak to what is contained in the – in the founding affidavit.  So – so what if you recall Precise Trade one of the directors in Precise Trade is an attorney for Siyangena.     That is correct Chair.   Now when this particular transaction happens Mr Montana can only raise R3.5 non-refundable he accepted it.     It becomes bizarre that the balance of the transaction is paid by the Precise Trade entity.    Where you know you have the lawyer for – for Siyangena.    Being you know the sole director paying the balance ofthis price.    You know so I mean when you look at it (indistinct) and then also you know then they request to have the property now the purchaser being changed to Precise Trade.    Mr Montana paid R3.5.    Ja and then you know the balance is paid and that company was – the property was intended for the beneficiary – his beneficiaries.      But now you know Precise Trade takes over this transaction and completes it and it is then registered as the purchaser.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    21.19 Chair you know indicates that on the 26 November 14 Ms De Beer met Mr Montana at the property.  Ms De Beer and Mr Montana did the walkabout and the keys were handed to Mr Montana ofthat property where Precise Trade had paid the balance.    That is correct Chair.    To Mr Montana yes.    I cannot recall.    Oh yes.    Ja in the previous page.  He was a trustee of thechildren’s trust.    Children yes Chair.    Yes Chair.   Pays the balance.    5.    In Precise Trade.    Correct Chair.    The keys were given.    Mr Montana.    This was picked up.   This was picked up by the – by the investigation Chair.    When the forensic investigations were done and there was a follow through on these transactions it revealed that this is what had happened.    Chair it is pos...    Yes Chair.  But this is (indistinct) affidavit I must say.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.   Mr Montana.    His trust, yes.    No Chair.    Not personal knowledge.    This is – this is what you know was part of the investigation (indistinct).    That is correct Chair.    Following the investigation – the work that the investigators had done.    The investigators went out Chair to interview you know the various people that they picked up as being people who were mentioned in the documents that they found in relation to the properties you know. So that work allowed them to be able to approach different individuals and ask them exactly what transpired.    And I guess Ms De Beer whoever she is can be interviewed or may have been interviewed to say what does she know about that.    Yes Chair.    Ja.  Chair I would like to say you know because I am the deponent of this and obviously some of the information was communicated to me so I do not have direct knowledge of some of the issues here.    And it would be dealt with accordingly.    You know by the lawyers in the matter before court.    That is correct Chair.    In the documents.   Yes.    There is copies – there is annexures Chair.    To the documents that indicates.    You know email correspondence.    That was picked up.    Through the investigations, yes.    Those emails.    Ms De Beer.    And Mr Montana yes.    Yes they are.    To Mr Montana.    That is correct Chair.    The trust.    That is correct Chair.    Precise Trade.   Precise Trade now is the purchaser – that is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    This transaction is a property in Sandhurst Chairperson.  199 Empire Place in Sandhurst.    Precise…    For PRASA.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes that is when the interdict – that is right.    Was the – was in the process when Siyangena was doing work for PRASA.    Yes.    So in relation to the Sandhurst property Chair the facts relating to this transaction were contained in a sworn statement by a Mr Louis Green an estate agent that was employed by Pam Golding Investments who was instructed by Mr Coller and – to sell the property in Sandhurst during about the middle of 2014.  So that statement is attached to the papers that are in court.    Mr Montana made an offer to purchase in Sandhurst in the amount of R13.9 million.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.   That is correct Chair.    Yes.      So on the 6 November 2014 Mr Green received an email from Mr Van Der Walt.  Mr Van Der Walt is Precise Trade.  A letter from…    That is correct.  From Pam – Pam Golding.    So he receives an email from Mr Van Der Walt and the letter is also attached Chairperson.  There is a number of emails thatare also attached to the – to the affidavit.  In the letter the attorneys confirmed that they had R5 million in trust – in a trust account with Investec Bank.    And on the 7 November Mr Green received a further email.  This is the….    Siyangena.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    So on the 7 November – so effectively this transaction was dealt with you know…    No – in the trust account?   Yes Chaiar.    Well yes that is what we thought was important Chair.    So on the 7 t h…    Our view that he is acting for Mr Montana.    Well Chair.    I cannot remember if it says but if you look at the interest was shown by Mr Montana at the time.    In relation to this property and when you look at you know what was happening during the transactions with Siyangena at the time you know the – what became bizarre was that the attorneys now of Siyangena were you know assisting Mr Montana in concluding these transactions.    To the papers.    No I do not recall Chair.    No.    There was another instruction on 21.25 on the 7 t h MrGreen received a further email from Mr Van Der Walt to which was attached a proof of payment.  So Mr Van Der Walt sends this email to Mr Green into a trust account of Pam Golding for and on behalf of Mr Montana.  So in the next – in the next – the first email I was alluding to the fact that I – I am not sure that he mentioned that he was acting on behalf of Mr Montana.  But when the payment was made you know he then reflects that it is made on behalf of …    Yes it becomes clearer now that he is acting on behalf of Mr Montana.    So there is attaching the proof of payment.    And then on the 25 November…    In relation to this property?    No, no.    And then again in the same month Chairperson on the 24 November Mr Green the estate agent received another letter from Mr Van Der Walt confirming an instruction from his client Mr Montana so it becomes clearer now that Mr Van Der Walt is also acting for MrMontana where Mr Montana has asked that the buyer be changed to Precise Trade.    From Mr Montana.    Yes it does.    That is correct.    Yes who was a trustee?    That is correct Chair.    “Mr Montana”    So the letter.    Drafted by Mr Van Der Walt.    Instructed Mr Green who was the estate agent to allocate the deposit paid on behalf of Mr Montana to Precise Trade.    What we are told Chair is that that amount comes – you know the attorneys Van Der Walt.    Is the one that confirms that that amount was sitting in their trust account.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.   Correct Chair.    Mr Van Der Walt.  That is correct Chair.    Had been doing work.    Ja.    That property as well.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Ja you have got to…    Ja you have to go through it over and over again.    To understand what actually happened.    Yes.    So now the property was signed on behalf of Precise Trade but Mr Coller, the seller right addressed an email to Mr Montana asking him to indicate whether he had any interest in taking occupation of the property before transfer.    The seller of the property?    No it is in the same month Chair.    Yes Chair.    Oh sorry.    That is correct Chair.    Was the seller.    Mr Montana.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair ja.     So Mr Montana continues to be involved in the transactions.    Well he continues to get involved in the transaction so there was an email.    For example the email address Mr Montana that was used was stipulated as – as a contact for the transferee so there was communication between the seller and Mr Montana.  In addition because the conveyers who obviously would be acting on behalf of the seller in this regard.  So that – that communication was happening when Mr Montana was involved.  In addition the conveyances addressed regular progress …    And these documents are also available in the foundingaffidavit Chair.    To those annexure.    That is correct Chair.    I can Chair.    Thank you Chair.     [Inaudible].     So the signed…[intervenes].     That’s okay.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.     That’s correct, it says“We were not aware of the delays of the payment of…[intervenes].     On 3 February 2015, Mr Montana addressed an email to Mr Colla [?] regarding the payment of the transfer costs in respect of the property, a copy of the email is attached Chairperson to thedocuments, before Court, in the email Mr Montana sais that,“we were not aware…[intervenes]     That’s correct I’m quoting sorry Chair, I’m quoting in inverted commas,“We are not aware of the delays in the payment of fees andthe consequent breach of contract. I’m aware that ourattorneys were busy with the VAT registration of the Trust,this may have contributed to the delays. I have asked theattorney to abandon the VAT registration for now and ensuretransfer is concluded immediately without further delay.  Ihave discussed the matter with our attorney, Mr Riaan vander Walt who has since been in contact with Thalita [?].   Hemade an undertaking to settle the fees by today or latesttomorrow morning”.     Well effectively Chair, he must be the person concerned obviously in relation to this particular transaction because he seems to be taking over – he’s involved in the communications that are happening even with the Estate Agency but also what is interesting is, he keeps referring to the attorney, Mr van der Walt having to settle the payments for his. So that’s what one can deduce from this.     Well they’re his attorneys.     That’s correct Chair.     Precise Trade.     Its transferred to Precise Trade Chair.     It’s addressed to Mr Montana.     Paragraph 21.32 Chair on 366 we talk about, on the 12 t h of March 2015 the sellers of the Sandhurst property addressing emails to Mr Montana, the email was attached to the document as well that’s before Court Chair it says…[intervenes].     The email is addressed to Mr Montana.     Sorry I’m not with you.     Yes, I was going there Chair, it says,“Hi Lucky”.     Lucky is Mr Montana.     That’s correct Chair.     It says,“I called Eskom today to let them know we have sold 119 andto try to transfer the electricity account out of Janet’s name, however, the process seems to need both parties.  We need  to give Eskom a move-out instruction to terminate our  account and then the new owners need to give them the  move-in instructions to activate the new owner’s account.   However, when we give them the move-out instruction they  will cut-off the electricity supply until the move-in order is  given. I obviously don’t want to leave you without electricity,  the pond and the wine cellar are linked and the wine cellar  needs power to pump out water and prevent flooding.  Would  you please let me know as soon as you are able to do the  account transfer with Eskom so that we can co-ordinate the  instruction to happen on the same day”.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct Chair.      That’s correct Chair, they speak to Mr Montana.     That’s correct Chair.     So on the 19 t h of March 2015 Mr Louis Green addressed an email to the seller of the Sandhurst property regarding the repairs to the gate motor, the security cameras and the transfer of the electricity account, and once again that email is attached to the Court PapersChair, we make that available.     Mr Green was the Estate Agent.  So he says, Mr Green, he writes to Janet and I quote Chairperson, he says,“Hi Janet, I chatted with Lucky, Lucky being Mr Montana,regarding the repair of the gate motor, the security camerasand the transfer of the electricity account.  He has confirmedthat the appointment at 9h30 on Friday the 20 t h of March15 and has requested they only attend to the gate motor. He will, at his expense re-instate the security video system. He has also requested that you hold off as far as the transferof the accounts is concerned.  He is extremely busy at themoment and undertakes to pay all that is related to the billsuntil the transfer has been done.  He has indicated that,should he be able to attend to it within the next few weeks, that he should be able to attend to it within the next fewweeks.  Your indulgence in this regard will be muchappreciated.  Could you please advise who the gardening andpool services companies are as he would like to continue withtheir service”,So this is what – obviously Mr Green relaying this information to, you know – yes.     Is this 21.34?     So a further thread of emails Chair relating to the Sandhurst property transaction at that time is attached to the founding affidavit, in particular, I wish to draw attention to the email addressed by the seller, the pool service company dated 31 s t March 2015 in which it said, and I quote,“Hi [indistinct] , this is just to confirm that we have notifiedthe new owner, Lucky, that the pool cover part has arrivedand we are waiting his instructions to carry out the repairs. We have also given the Pam Golding Agent, Louis Green yourcontact details so that they can get in touch with you directly,if necessary”.     Yes Chair, so it will be noted that Mr van der Walt was sole Director and shareholder of Precise Trade and Invest is not copied on any of the abovementioned emails, the emails are direct to Mr Montana.     Well effectively that, you know, Mr Montana, at the end of the day was the person that the property was bought on behalf of.     Yes Chair.     To the…[intervenes].     That’s it Chair.     Correct Chair.     Lucky Montana, that’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     So on the 10 t h of May Chair, 2016 Mr Green sent an email to Mr Montana, Mr Green…[intervenes].     This is 2016 Chair.    Yes Chair.      So Mr Green advised that he sellers of the Sandhurst property had found two extra keys for the electric pool cover.     That’s correct.     Mr Green.     That’s correct Chair     Mr van der Walt responded, a copy of these emails is also attached, he then says in an email…[intervenes].     He says,“Hi please explain why you have cc’d Mnr L Montana, I’m just thinking that Mnr is meneer, in this email, you are well awareof the fact, and as already explained to you last year beforethe property was even bought by my company that Mnr LMontana has nothing to do with Precise or the property. Please refrain from this action in the future, this isconfusing”,No it’s not.     Yes Chair, so the papers in the previous application were issued on the 2 n d of February 2016, the Sandhurst property transaction was mentioned in those papers, the above email was sent, only after Mr Montana was confronted with allegations contained in those papers and two days before Mr van der Walt deposed to the confirmatory affidavit.     Mr Montana, ja.     That’s correct.     That’s correct, so when the application was made he had to cover up there.     Yes Chair.     It’s in Hurlingham Chairperson, it’s situated at 12Montrose Road in Hurlingham.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.     In 21.40.     That’s correct Chair.     Must I continue to 21.40?     So Mr Green was mandated by Mrs Gaviser [?] to marketand sell the Hurlingham property.  So the property was placed on show which Mr Montana attended on about October 2014.  Mr Montana, having viewed the property, immediately expressed an interest in purchasing the property.  On about 15 October 2014 Mr Montana requested that the offer to purchase be forwarded to Mr Smith.     The Trustee.     That’s correct Chair of the minor property Trust, his children’s.    Purchase price is R12million.     R12million.     That’s correct Chair.     So the minor property Trust…[intervenes].     Precise Trading, that’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.    That’s correct Chair.      It was R10.5million and then it went to R11million.     R12million Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     So the offer was signed by Mr Smith, the Trustee Chair, in his capacity as the Trustee of the minor property Trust, however, both Mr Smith and Mr Montana represented to Mr Green that the property was being purchased by Mr Montana and there’s reference to correspondence to that effect Chair.     And the offer was rejected by the seller.     So on the 23 r d of October 2014 the minor property Trust,through an email from Seresa David, Ms David, made another offer to purchase the Hurlingham property for an amount of R13.5million and it was again – proof of that email correspondence is attached to the papers before Court.     That’s correct Chair – that is correct in 21.41 it says so, the offer was subjected to payment of a deposit in the amount of R2.4million and the purchaser obtaining a bond of R9.6million.     So that clause was deleted Chairperson and this is referenced in 21.44 which indicated that the offer was a cash purchase,furthermore the sale was subject to payment of a deposit in the amount of R2million, so the bond was no longer an issue here because there was cash available to purchase the property.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes Chair.     A new offer to purchase was submitted where Mr Montana was substituted for the minor property Trust as the purchaser.     No Chair, so they make the offer of R13.5million but because it’s a cash sale you know and the bond requirement is not an issue anymore and one would surmise that in relation to that transaction the purchaser would have been Mr Montana and that’s whyon the 3 r d of March 2015 they signed a new offer, I suppose it’s in relation to the same property Chairperson but they changed the name of the purchaser here to being the Trust and not Mr Montana.     It’s the R13.5million Chair.     That’s correct Chair, it’s the same amount as what was offered.     That’s correct.     The new offer to purchase was submitted by Mr Montana.     Yes, what 21.45 says Chair is that the new offer to purchase was submitted in which Mr Montana was substituted for the minor Trust property as the purchaser.     So on the 24 t h of March 2015 Precise Trade Chair, paid the deposit of R2million into the Trust account of Janine Bredekamp, a conveyancer attending to the transfer of the Hurlingham property and there’s proof of that.    Yes Chair.     So there were various delays Chair, as reflected in 21.47 relating to the payment of the balance of the purchase price in the amount of the R11.5million and a copy of a letter between Mr van der Merwe, Mr van der Merwe is the attorney for Siyangena…[intervenes].     Correct Chair so Mr van der Walt wrote in quotes he says    Yes, they outstanding purchase price was eventually paid, Chairperson on the 15th of May 2015.     That is correct, Chair.  That was his quest.      That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Well, Mr – in 2011 Chairperson Mr Gansho approached a certain Mr Murphy regarding a property which was situated in Durban.  The purchase of that property in the Point Precinct in Durban and Mr Murphy had to depose to  an affidavit searching out the sequence of events that led to the sale of that unit and a copy Mr Murphy’s affidavit was also attached to the papers, Chair.     Well, Mr Murphy had placed a unit including the furnitureand fittings, I think he was the owner, Chair.  Approached Mr Murphy, if I recall Chair.     That is right, sir he was ...[intervenes].      Let me just find it here, Chair.     Well, yes.     It was three million and fifty thousand.     That is correct, Chair.     Mr Gansho approached Mr Murphy and indicated an interest in purchasing the property, Chair.  As well as the furniture, some furniture that was in the property.     Yes, he visited the unit on several occasions Chair.     So, Mr Gansho for the first-time informed Mr Murphy that he was not in fact the purchaser of the property.  Mr Gansho advised MrMurphy that Mr van der Walt would contact Mr Murphy and provide further details.     So, Mr Murphy was the contacted by Mr van der Walt who advised that the purchaser was to be an entity called Grand Tower Trade and invest all four (Pty) Ltd.  Mr van der Walt is the sole Director and shareholder of Grand Tower and confirmation to that he has attached to the papers, Chair, of directorship from the auditors of Grand Tower.     That is correct.  That is correct, Chair.     The chance relating to the payments of the purchase price when he negotiates and agreed with Mr van der Walt, Chair, as arepresentative of Grand Tower.     That is correct, Chair.  So, Mr Murphy and the Grand Tower concluded their agreement for the sale and purchase of that unit and furniture and fittings and the agreements are also provided, Chair.  How can they not provide it?     Yes, Chair.    But, Mr van der Walt has been the link, Chair.     Yes.  There was an e-mail that was addressed by Mr Gansho to the Reverend Maromo and in that e-mail Mr Gansho wrote, “Visit the following link for information on your accommodation my apartment is C7 to 10.  Enjoy every moment if any questions or need anything just call me.”      Well, that effectively Mr Gansho you know was the ownerbecause you do not lease somebody else’s property Chair or invite people to occupy somebody’s property if you are not necessarily the owner thereof. ADV VAS     Yes, Chair.     Mr Gansho in fact on the 12t h of August 2016 he says when I first saw the apartment [intervenes].     Yes, Chair.  The investigators and this is you know obviously during the forensic investigation that was done by Wilsons.     A transcript of the interview with Mr Gansho which was held on the 12 t h of August 2016.     Read into the record.  “You see, when I first saw the apartment, we were busy with our 2010 projects at the time so at some point [intervenes].”      Would be those projects, the development of the stations, Chair, in relation to phase one of the project and the extension of thepilot phase.     So, he says – he says at some point we would be made missing.  Sorry, at some point we would be made missing our flights coming back because of the durations of the meetings and all that.  One of the colleagues in Durban said at the waterfront where people can stay we used to sleep in different apartments there.  So we slept there and at one time I went there with the family and then he looked at the place the I got curious, I asked which one of these apartments are selling.  Mr Murphy said he is selling in that I think it is C10.  We went in there, welooked at it, if we came there on a Thursday or a Friday we sleep over on Saturday then we will invite some of the guys who we were with at the meetings.  One of the guys who was – who wants went there whose Mr it does not show. It does not reflect it is not audible I do not know his name is he is Alvin.  He is from Siyagena.  In one instance I think it is Mr Mellerkamp, so you really got interest in this particular apartment and then I approached Mr Murphy to say I would like to buy this then this Alvin guy said he is also interested, their company is also interested and he said you look very much interested in this and I said yes I am but I think it is too steep for me to be acquiring it.  He said okay, but do you like this flat?  And I said yes I do, then he said okay that is fine and then I approached this guy Murphy.  I said Craig I am really interested in this apartment.  So we went into the whole nitty-gritty’s of it.  The next thing I hear Alvin saying you can get that flat.  Then when you are ready said okay you can buy the flat and then we get it to be acquired by thecompany he said, it will not be a problem for us as the company acquire the flat and then maybe at some point when you are ready for it we can talk.  I said okay that is fine.     Mr, what seems to have happened also here Chairperson is that Mr Gansho was the assistant in purchasing that property as well.     That is correct, Chair.  He showed interest in the propertyand yes.     It does say.     I do not.     Grand Tower, yes.     Was the representative of - Chair, yes.     We can check that, Chair.      We will check that, Chair.  I cannot seem to remember.     Yes, Chair.  What we deduced from this transaction you know the involvement of Mr van der Walt in assisting Mr Gansho in obtaining this property and also the fact that this was during that timewhere Siyagena was really involved in the transactions in PRASA and you will recall Chairperson as part of the evidence that we gave that Mr van der Walt I mean Mr Gansho was the one that was really pushing the transactions was for Siyagena to be concluded with PRASA.  So connection was then made you know in relation to his participation in the Siyagena transaction and in the involvement of Mr van der Walt in this respect.     Three million Chair.     Well [intervenes].     It connects to Siyagena to a person through Mr van der Walt.     So that is how you know the way we interpreted this particular transaction that was a form of gratuity that Mr – Mr – Mr ...[intervenes].      Mr Gansho was receiving in relation to his relationship to Siyagena.  So, they assisted him.     No, Mr Gansho is an employee at PRASA, Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.     Yes, it was after the transactions, Chair.     Yes.     Well, he was dismissed, Chair.     Yes, he was found guilty of in his conduct and in relation to [indistinct]     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     And we can get the transcripts.  Yes, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     No, I – I do not have the date, Chair.     No, I cannot remember the year, Chairperson.     I will find out, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Not yet.     Chair, the challenges that we had in finding information at PRASA were grave because you keno the information was just not there really so we struggled when we took these papers to Court.  What we understood had transpired was that a Mr Montana had a special IT services an employee who was really looking after his IT related issues, Mr Tusi, I will get his surname now.  His name is ...[indistinct] he was one of PRASA’s IT specialists, that is paragraph 52, Chairperson.     Who it was found that he on the instruction of Mr Montanahad deleted information at PRASA on PRASA’s service relating to anything related to information pertaining Mr Montana and a lot of the information that was required for these transactions.  So wilfully what happened was that he was then disciplined as well and he was found guilty and he was dismissed.  So you know the struggles with the information were there because they were destroyed and I think that Chair having reference to Mr – Dr Molofe’s information expresses the same you know difficulties as well and frustrations around getting information at PRASA.  So, we were also saddled with that problem.     Yes, because that disciplinary hearing was also conducted by an external party so the recordings will be there.     I will do, Chair.    Yes, Chair.  That is definitely.  Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     It has.
