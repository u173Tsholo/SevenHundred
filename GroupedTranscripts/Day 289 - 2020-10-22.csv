CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning everybody.    Are we ready?    Yes.        Good morning Mr Laher.   The oath you took yesterday or affirmation will continue to apply today.  You understand?    Okay alright.    Mr Laher.    Just listen to the question carefully.  I understood you to be saying you raised as – you raised questions as much as you could without – unless you were going to be insubordinate.  In other words you did not want to go beyond a certain point in raising issues.    Because you thought that going beyond a certain point would be insubordinate, you accept that?    That is what you mean?    So My Myburgh do you want to …    I hope that has helped?    Well why would you have considered that it would be insubordination – it would have been insubordination to raise legitimate issues which you were entitled to raise?    But were you not there at least in part to advise him and the others?    So?  So why would – why would you have thought that giving him your honest advise would be insubordination?  Would constitute insubordination?    So – so what is your answer to my question?  Why would you have thought that if you gave him what was your honest advice that would be regarded as insubordination?    But respect does not mean you are – you agree with something he says if you do not generally agree with it – it is not?  You can have a – can raise issues and you have a debate – you do not agree with him; he does not agree with you.    If he has the power to make a decision he makes his decision he can follow your advice or not follow advice but you have – you have given him your honest advice so why would doing that have been insubordination in your mind?    Do you still think that as you sit there do you still think that you should have had that fear?    Sorry.    Well there would have been nothing insubordinate Mr Laher about you honestly putting your – your views.  There would have been nothing insubordinate about that.  Do you not agree?    Hm.    No, no we accept – we accept that but you – you have suggested that you did not go – you stopped at a certain point because you thought going beyond that point would be insubordination.  Do you accept now that there would have been no insubordination if you had not stopped?  As long as you put your views in a normal way, in a collegial way but you do not – you put them.    Do you accept that now that there would have been no insubordination?    Well Mr Myburgh just gave you a definition of insubordination.  Remember he just gave you a definition of insubordination.  A refusal to obey a lawful and reasonable instruction.      Would that have been insubordination?    But also you have not said anything that suggests that Mr Singh was known to you to have done certain things to junior members of staff if they stood up to him on certain points.  You have not suggested that.  I take it that there was no history of him acting like that that was known to you?    But that was not something that was in your mind?    Mr Myburgh.    I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  You said Bundle 4[a] and what page?    508.  No I do not have 508 on Bundle [a].    Yes okay.       When you say in paragraph 32    Is that correct?     Sorry?     Well, if the explanation was reasonable, why would you need to defer to him?     You mean... do you mean, it was reasonable but not correct?   But then the seniority, expertise, experience and ability should not come in, should it?     My Myburgh.       You say 791 point?     44.     The number on the margins.     When it says line 19, there is 10, 20.     Ja, ja.     Let us take the tea adjournment, we will resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     I am sorry, what was that answer?     It was part of the negotiations?     Okay.       Well, Mr Laher, it gives one impression that it may give is that no proper – either no proper homework had been done when 1,62 percent was – thought was the right percentage and when somebody else who had done his or her proper homework came up, showed that this 1.62% was really – had no foundation.  Either that or the people who came up with 1.62 had done their homework but there is some other reason why they agreed to 30%, that is difficult to understand because whatever was put on the table must be the kind of factors or things that would have been taken into account at arriving at 1.62.     Is it not?     But I do not think the percentage should change, is it not, because if you say – if you say if you had put in a figure as opposed to a percentage and you had said, for example, it must be R1 million that is advance payment and then later on you agreed to R30 million and you say there was a change in the price, you know, the percentage might have remained the same.     Okay.  But if you put the percentage, one would have thought that you are taken into account everything and the percentage would remain the same or if there is a change, it would not be as drastic a change as this.  That is what one would have thought.     Well, I am not sure that I follow the explanation, Mr Laher.  It is quite strange, to say the least, but maybe you have said what you are able to say.  Mr Myburgh?     791 point?     83.     I am not sure but I thought Mr Myburgh’s question was more about what do you say to Mr Callard’s statement that all you could say was you were recording what the bidders said and you provided no further explanation.  Am I right, Mr Myburgh?     Yes.     When you say you dealt with it you are not saying your raised it because Mr Callard is concerned about you not providing an explanation.     Are you saying you did provide an explanation?     You did tell him?     Okay, thank you.  Thank you, Mr Laher, for coming.  If we need you again we will ask you to come back but thank you very much, you are now excused.     Yes.     Yes.  No, no, that is fine, I think let us start the usual time, ten o’clock, ja.     We – you do not have an idea how long he might be, hey?  Maybe two hours?     By lunchtime, ja.  Okay, alright.  Thank you, we will adjourn for the day.  We adjourn. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Good morning Chairperson.    Yes we are.  Mr Laher is back with us this morning.    Chairperson.    Good morning Mr Laher.    I want to start off by asking you a few general questions.  You were a member of the negotiation team in relation to both of the transactions involving the 64 locomotives and the 100 locomotives.  What did you consider your role to be within these negotiating teams?    Well did you consider yourself simply to be a resource to Mr Singh?    Did you consider yourself simply to be a resource to Mr Singh?    You consider that you did not have to exercise any judgment?    And act in the best interests of your employer?    You were not just sitting there with your eyes and ears closed?    So let us then redefine your role.    What was it?    Yes.    And if you had concerns to raise them.    So when you say you did not make any decision you were still obliged if you came across something that did not look right to raise the issue?    Which you did.    And you were also under an obligation to ensure that any query that you had was properly satisfied in your mind?    That was your role?    Did you ever suspect that the award of these two tenders was corrupt in any way?    Not the slightest suspicion?    Not the slightest suspicion of any irregularities at play?    Despite all the queries that you raised?    Are you certain about that?    So for example and we will come to the detail in a moment.  You were involved in negotiations where you had done a reasonable miscalculation of R41 million.    You go into the negotiations and offer is made of below that – three days later you told Mr Molefe has reached an agreement outside of the negotiations at a much increased figure.  You did not think that was irregular in any way?    Mr Laher please answer my question?  Did you think that was irregular or not?    Not?    Well in fact you did not even ask him.  We will come to your statement in a moment.  You did not ask him about that issue.  About the fact that Mr Molefe had done a deal outside of the negotiating team.    Yes.  But you did not question that?    Well we will come to your statement.  Now with the benefit of hindsight what is your view on irregularities?    You do not think you could have done more Mr Laher?    Could you have done more yes or no?    So even now reflecting on the position you still believe you could have done no more?    You could not have been any more vigilant?    Yes.  But we will come to that.  So you stopped short of being more vigilant because you did not want to be insubordinate, is that what you saying?    That is precisely what you say.    Yes.  No that is not what you saying.  You saying that I did not raise anything more for fear of being insubordinate.    So if you bear with me.  It follows from that that perhaps you could have raised more but it was through fear that you did not.  Is that as I understand your evidence?    Yes thank you.    You cannot run those two lines together.  So let me from the commission’s point of view put my cards on the table.  One of things that this commission is going to have to consider in the final analysis is how did all of these procurement irregularities actually happen.  And what the commission is going to have to look at is people like you obviously well educated, intelligent people why did they not report any irregularities?  How did it happen?  So you are not on trial here.  This is not a disciplinary hearing.  But I am asking you to take the commission into your confidence and what you need to deal with is this.  When you got the answer from Mr Singh is it that you trusted his answer as being correct or is it that you were fearful of interrogating any further and therefore you stopped.  Those are two different things.  You understand that?    So which of it then was it – trust or fear?    So where does the fear then enter the equation?    Mr Laher let me give you an example.  We will come to it in a moment.  During the negotiations you identified that CSR was using the incorrect exchange rate to – counted for almost R3 million of their price.  You told Mr Singh that and he said to you, do not worry negotiations are all about the final price.  And you accepted that.    You accepted that?    Negotiations are all about the final price they are not about the constituent components.  You accepted that?    Now you are a chartered accountant.  I take it you do not – you would not agree with that at all that negotiations are not just about the final price.  Negotiations are about the constituent component surely making up the final price that is what you were doing.  Yes when Mr Singh told you that you just let it go and accepted it.    But Mr Laher negotiations are not – you know just about the final price.  Correct?    Yes you agree with me it is not just about the final price.  I mean when you go into negotiations I hope this is not what happens of this sort.  You do not just say well put up your final price.  You interrogate how you get to the price that is what it is all about correct?    So when Mr Singh told you a chartered accountant do not worry about that R3 million it is all about the final price.  You just accepted that.    Well we are going to come to that.  Because there is a line in your statement you write I am interested to see what it – what it means.  So where do we end here?  Was there any fear?  Was there a degree of fear that stopped you from interrogating some of these answers further?  Yes or no?    Sorry yes or no?    So the answer is yes?    But you told the Chairperson that you did not press the issue any further for fear of insubordination.  Correct    And you say that is only a very small issue.    So that is how I understand your evidence.    Now why would you be insubordinate?  That is another thing I do not understand.  And it is another thing that the commission is going to have to look at because many employees in your position would say that.  But why are insubordinate if you are a member or a negotiating team – you are not just a calculator – you not a stenographer?  You there to exercise judgment.  Why you insubordinate if you ask more than one or two questions about an issue? How does that translate into insubordination?    You not answering my question?  Why if you interrogate things further in a courteous way why would that constitute insubordination?  Do you know what insubordination is?    It is the refusal to obey typically a lawful and reasonable instruction.  If you a member of a negotiating team and you have a robust debate with Mr Singh surely that does not constitute insubordination?    Well we do not see that.  I mean from your statement you raise a concern you get an answer and you accept it.  There does not seem to be a robust debate.    Well in fact in your statement there is no reflection of any debate.    Thank you.  By the time of these negotiations in 2014 how long had you been employed at Transnet?    Yes.  And you were a chartered accountant?    And are a chartered accountant?    And you accept that you bound by the – your professional rules?    Let us deal then with the increase in the ETC of the 100 locomotives.  So you accept that there was a considerable increase in the ETC from R3.8 billion to R4.8 billion?  Correct?    And that was in a very short space of time.  The business case or we can go to the documents if need be was agreed in January of 2014 and by May 2014 they – the recommendation that was made in the memorandum that you prepared for Mr Singh was accepted.  Correct?    So there – this very big change an increase came about in a short space of time.  Correct?    Just Mr Laher you accept it came about in a short space of time?    Not.  Alright.  Between January and May?    You say that is an extended period?    Now – well let me ask you this.  You accept that in January of 2014 the business case number was accepted.    Yes would – this comes from your own documents I will take you there.  And then we know in May the increase number was accepted.    Alright.  Now you had done a reason – a so called reasonability calculation.    For Mr Singh that worked out at R4.1 billion really.  R41 million per locomotive.  And let us go to your – your statement.  This is at Bundle 4[a] page 504.  So you do and I direct your attention to paragraph 27.  You had done your reasonability calculation of R41 million that you deal with in paragraph 26. “During the negotiations Mr Singh I take it pitched a priced at R38.5.”    Would that – who would that person have been?    Mr Jiyane.  Alright so that accorded essentially with the business case number.    That accorded with the business case number.    We at page 508.    I am sorry – I beg your pardon then we are in Bundle [b] the small file.  I am sorry.    So at paragraph 26 you talk about your reasonability calculation.    Then at 27 you have confirmed that the chairperson as you say was Mr Jiyane who pitches the price 3.5.  CSR they wanted 49 and they refused to come down.    And then you go on to say well you never accepted that etcetera.  But what I am interested in is paragraph 28.  So you were present at the negotiations where the 38.5 offer is made and where CSR wanted 49.    Which on the face of it was highly inflated obviously.    Correct.    You were there.    And then at 28 you say   That is before any board approval, is that right?    That is outside of the negotiations.    I beg your pardon.    You cannot distance yourself from this Mr Laher.    This is a formal process is that not so?    It was held – just remind us where it was held?    Yes.    So there was not another negotiation between the one you speak to at paragraph 27 and 28, correct?  There was no – another meeting?    So this must have come as a bit of a surprise to you?    More particularly because – and I suppose the term itself is important.  Your reasonability calculation was R3 million per locomotive less.    Whereas you had that work.    Were you very surprised by this?    Let us just deal with one thing at a time if you do not mind.  Were you surprised?    Ja.  Were you perhaps shocked?    Well Mr Laher let us just look at what happens.  You in a negotiation where 38.5 is offered.  You have done a reasonability calculation of 41.  CSR want an inflated 49 and two days later you told literally out of the blue that the Chief Executive has agreed on 44.  That must have shocked you presumably or was that how things worked at Transnet?    You remember my question?  It is really quite simple.  I know – we know what your case is I am asking you specific questions.  Were you shocked by that?    But you were at least surprised?    Okay well let us leave it at that.  So    So how did it work?  You had a negotiating meeting a day or two before.  Then you were told of Mr Molefe’s decision.    Was that then at a – at this meeting or discussion you had a day or two…    After the last negotiation.    So you said to him, well but that is more expensive than Mitsui.    And was it?    Substantially?    Was it substantially more?    Well we relying on you; you are a chartered accountant.    You were involved in these negotiations.  You put up all these documents in this hearing.  Can you tell us – I mean presumably if it was just a little bit more you would not have raised it?    Was it a significant increase – yes or no?    Then why did you say Mitsui is cheaper if it was not significant?    But on the face of it it would have been significant because that is why you made the point.  I mean we are not talking about R50 here.    Correct?    On the face of it.    Right.  And you say   But that of course does not answer the price question does it?  I mean the problem was that this was too much, and he says to you but we have already decided to go to CSR.  That hardly answers your concern about it being too expensive.  Correct? 
MR LAHER:  Morning Chairperson.    Thank you.    Morning.    Chair my role was a support role.  In essence we would provide financial support to the chairpersons during the negotiations.  We would keep record of the pricing as the different pricing updates were received from the bidders over that period of time.  We would provide information to the legal team in terms of their contract drafting process and to contribute to the negotiations on financial related aspects.  The role did not involve making any decisions.  We did not have a delegation to make any decisions.    Well we were a resource to the negotiating team.    I would think so ja.    I would have had to exercise some judgment. ADV    Ja.    Correct – correct.    No.    Right.    So to provide financial support and provide input throughout the negotiation process.  I think I have spelt it out in my statement.    Somewhere.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct ja.    At that period of time no.  I had no suspicion of anything untoward happening. Maybe it was because we were so involved in the detail.  Maybe it was because we were so involved with – under pressure. I mean it was a very pressurising environment we were dealing with multiple issues at the same time.  But at that point in time no I had no suspicions.    Not that I can recall.    Not that I can recall.    Correct.  So no suspicions.    Yes.    Ja.    I questioned it as I gave evidence yesterday.  I did question it with Mr Singh.  So I did the calculation.  My calculation…    No.    I received an adequate response from Mr Singh.    Well Mr Molefe was part of the steering committee and they were the ones making the decisions.    Well I questioned why the price was higher than the price I calculated which is what is in my statement.  And that question was asked to Mr Singh and Mr Singh provided an adequate response to me at that point in time.    So from what I have heard and what I have seen in the media and what I have seen happening at the commission I mean there have been witnesses that have said some startling things and obviously with that evidence a mind it does seem like there was something untoward happening in the background.    I think I did the best that I could at that point in time.  I raised a number of issues as per the evidence I gave yesterday.  I raised the issues through emails.  I raised the issues through the reports that I submitted.  I raised the issues verbally.  I raised the issues with bidders directly.  I raised the issues with my principle who was Mr Singh.  I raised the issues with many people in the same room not only Mr Singh.  So when I raised the issues Transnet internal audit were there.  When I raised the – the written issues I addressed the issues to the CFET through to the board and Transnet steering committee.  Whist in negotiations people that were in the room when I raised the issues would include the head of legal.  The issues I raised around the Durban move including emails sent to the Group Chief Procurement Officer as well as the Head of Legal as well as the Chief Financial Officer of the organisation.    I do not think I could have done more.    At that point in time I did as much as I could.    My fear if I was any more vigilant I would have been insubordinate.    No.  I am saying…    I said I raised as much as I could.    Ja – so I raised as much as I could.    In my view at that point I raised as much as I could.    Sorry.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    And the explanations I received obviously to my satisfaction when I did raise those questions.    Yes.    Trust – I trusted his answers.    This was just something at the back of your head.  It is something – it is always there.    It is a….    Yes.    I accepted it and he did say more.    Well he explained it.  He explained further than just it is about the final price.  He explained it is a process of negotiation which is a process of give and take.  And you got to consider the risk that the bidders were willing to accept.  So he provided a rational explanation to me.  I mean when you do any type of negotiation it is always a give and take.    Well it is about the process that happens to get to the final price.    Yes.  Ja that is what I did.    Well he did not just say do not worry about    If there was it was to a very small degree.    Very small degree.    Ja but a very small degree.  It was more about trust what he was saying.    Correct.    Yes.    Ja.    So as I said it was a very small element.  I trusted his answer that he gave me.  I raised the issues that were necessary to be raised and the answer was – was…    Ja.    Correct so that robust debate did happen.    Well there was a debate about it obviously.  It is not going to be – I say something he gives me an answer immediately and I accept it.    I am clarifying that now.    So Chair I did raise the legitimate issues and we did have the debate.  So I mean during the debate I would have debated with him my views and I suppose at the back of my mind there was a little fear that if I debated it too vigorously then it is – I mean I am basically telling him he does not know what he is talking about.  And he was a respected individual.  I mean highly experienced – highly intelligent and he was my senior – he was my principle.    Yes.    So I gave him my honest advice and we had the debate to the extent that debate became vigorous and I continued along that line.  It could have resulted in insubordination but that was a very small fear at the back of my head.  I mean the explanations he was giving to me at that point in time seemed reasonable.    Chair I suppose there is always that little fear when you dealing with someone higher than you – someone that is more senior.  There is always that little fear that you got to treat them with respect and you know just a little fear at the back of your head.    Yes.    Chair as I said I – I gave him – I gave him my honest opinion.  I gave him the – what I wanted to get him and we had the debate about it.  The response he gave me was – was adequate.  So I mean as I said earlier it was – it was a very small fear of insubordination at the back of my mind but it was not really insubordination that was the issue it was that I trusted what he told me.  I had no reason to believe that he told me anything that was untoward.    With hindsight and seeing what is being presented at the commission ja maybe I should have – should have just – ja been insubordinate.    Maybe I should have gone down the road of being insubordinate with hindsight and seeing what we have seen happening at the commission.    Yes.  But Chair I think the principle is I did put my views across and I did have the debate so it was not like I did not do it.    I did put my views across and I did have the debate.    Chair I…    Chair I do not know about that.  I mean I do not know how Mr Singh would have taken me not agreeing with him.    Ja…    Chair shoo I do not know.    Look he was known to raise his voice and have a temper so he was I mean up and down.  He could be calm at one stage and then suddenly you know lose it.  So I mean he was known to be something like that.    Obviously there is that little fear at the back of your head that you know it could happen to you.    For I think it was about nine years then.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Ja.    Correct.    Yes to space and parameters.    No.  No.    No.    There was an extended period.    It was approved in January – I think it was approved in January ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Jiyane.    Mr Jiyane.    I do not know why he pitched R3.5.    Ja the business case was R3.8.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Correct.    Ja.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.  Outside of the negotiations we were involved in.  Remember we were not appointed into those negotiations we were just told to go and assist.    We were not appointed into the negotiations. ADV    We were there – ja we were there.    Ja.    Yes.    It was at Webber Wentzel’s offices.    Ja.    Not that I was involved in no.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    I was surprised but I – that is why I raised the question to Mr Singh.    Yes.    I do not think I was shocked.    That was a process so we – as I say in the negotiation sessions we were in the prices were never agreed.  It was always they would come back to us and tell us [talking over one another].    I do not think I was shocked.    Surprised ja.    When we received the notification that that was going to be the final.    ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    It was.    I cannot recall what the Mitsui quote was but ja and the Mitsui quote from a year before that.    It was more but I do not think it was substantial.    Ja.    Ja.  Ja.    I do not think so no.    It was cheaper because the price was cheaper.  I will have to go and check the numbers again I cannot recall at this point in time.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.     Yes, but it was a different locomotive.     Yes.  CSR had a different locomotive.     Ja.     No, but ...[intervenes]      I mean, it is for that ...[intervenes]      ...it is for the discussion afterwards.     Ja, well there is reasons therefore and that is what he explained.  I mean, he explained, it is a different locomotive.  The locomotive is a different specification which means that the price will be higher because the different specification requires more steel, et cetera, et cetera.  And that pushes the price higher to a different locomotive.     And I mean, if you go through the memo, it justifies the memo that requested this to go through to CSR.     It justifies why it goes to CSR and there is an explanation putting there in the memo.     Yes.  Well, I cannot say I know the history.     No, I did not know...     Recently, ja.     The team reports into the chairpersons.  The chairpersons report into the sub-committee.     Ja, he is part of the team.  But we reported into the chairpersons.       Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Correct.     Correct.     No, it comprises Mr Singh, Mr Molefe and Mr Gama.     Yes, probably.  It is part of mine... it is part of the sub-committee meeting that they held.       Ja, sure.     Sure.     Sure, sure, sure.     Yes.     My understanding is, they would have met with the sub-committee.  Mr Molefe being the most senior person in the sub-committee would be the one that makes the final decision.  My understanding of how a committee works.  Because normally, the most senior person in the committee would ...[intervenes]      No.     Ja.     Ja     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     May we read further?     Ja.     Sure.     Ja.     Ja.     I think it is important to read it with the next sentence.     No, I was persuaded with what he said as far as the next sentence ...[intervenes]      Ja.     H’m.     Ja.     Sure, ja.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Ja, ja.     Acceptable in terms of the risk, the bidders were not ...[intervenes]      Ja, ja.     I was persuaded with the next sentence     It was the mistake they made but I mean, the explanation they provided were ...[intervenes]      So the explanation that was provided was reasonable at that point in time.     In the next sentence, ja.     Correct.     Ja.     It does not accord with my view, ja.     Yes, correct.     Yes.     Right.     Correct.     So, I mean, it is not only about the exchange rate.  It is also about the rest of the negotiations.       There is also about what the bidders were willing to accept.  So, I mean, when you do a negotiation for anything, it is not only about one element.       It was.     I did.  I did do that.     I did that.     But that was part of the negotiation sessions.  I mean, I raised it directly with the bidders to say, this is the wrong percentage(?).     But I did do it.     Ja.     Ja.     Sorry, say that again?     I have raised it with the bidders during negotiations.     But I raised it with him as well.     I think I raised in point 30 or I raised my concerns of the high costs directly with the bidders.     Ja.     That is when I am referring to when I talk about that.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, the risk relates to other elements, not ...[intervenes]     No, I do not think I said that.     So it was.  As I said, these matters were debated with Mr Singh as I said earlier.       It was pressed in the negotiations.     Ja, Chair.  The explanations ...[intervenes]      The explanations provided was reasonable at that point in time.     The explanation provided was reasonable at that point in time.     I suppose ...[intervenes]      It was reasonable and it made sense at that point in time.  So accepted what he was telling me.       Ja.  And you respected that he had experience and you knew what he was talking about.  And he spoke with authority.  So you accepted it.       Ja, so Chair.  As a finance person, obviously, you want to focus on the individual parts but during the negotiations the chairpersons were much focussed on the overall price and that is just the impression I got during the negotiations.     I would have liked for us to focus more on the individual elements that made up the price because then you could, you know, take things a bit further and you know going with a more with the bidders.     Yes.     From my point of view.     Ja.     Debate to that.  I did not leave it.  Debated it.     Ja, so the components are one section.       The overall price is another section.     And the risk related to overall price is another section.       Correct.     Yes.     Correct.     I suppose there should be more rigour in discussing the detailed elements that make it up and in that way you can... you can get to the bottom of each of the elements.     Possible.     Ja.  Possible, ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Correct.     H’m.     I cannot recall saying that.     H’m, h’m.  I cannot recall if I said that ...[intervenes]       Ja, what I probably did was try to raise it as much as I could during the negotiations.  So even though they were focussing on overall price, I would have, you know, butted in to say but what about this, what about that.  Just to make sure that it is being addressed.     I thought I was doing a good enough job by just trying to raise the issues myself.     H’m.     J.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Not that I can recall but I mean I can go back and check what ...[intervenes]      No, I do not think I put my foot down.     So as I said, I would have raised the issues myself directly to say that we have got to focus on escalations directly with the bidders.  And I would say escalation during the negotiation sessions.   The same with all the different elements, I would have raised directly with the bidders to say we got to focus on this, we got to focus on that and see what responses we got from the bidders.  And that is what I did.     Paragraph three, two?     Ja.       Ja.     Right.     Right.     Without building risk into it.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja, that is the explanation I gave to the Chair a few minutes ago.     And because he said that there is risk involved and there is... you have to pay a price for the risk.     [No audible reply]      With rigorous debate that happened before that.     Ja.     So that is why I am saying now that is what happened.  To clarify.     It was a debate ...[intervenes]      At the back of your mind, but I mean ...[intervenes]      So the debate was held.  I mean ...[intervenes]      Let me stop you with the word rigorous but the debate was out.       Ja.     At the back of your mind, as I have said, it is always there.       So go though it with Mr Sing.  So approach him and say that my believe is that my calculation is a certain number and this is a number.  They are using the wrong numbers in the calculation.  And then asking why are the prices higher.  Why would it be to a higher number?       And his explanation would have been, as I said there, he believed it was a rigorous negotiation process.  And it was a rigorous negotiation process where it was up and down over a period.     And based there upon, the bidders were willing to only... and we were not there when the final price... we only agreed to that because there was risk involved.   And they were only willing to accept that price because there was risk involved and because of that risk, they wanted a higher price.   And that was the additional element of risk that pushed it up to R 44 million ...[intervenes]      Well, he would have come back to me and I mean, I would have said ...[intervenes]      Effectively, I would have said    Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     [No audible reply]      Possible, ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     What you see in the notes are only a few pages.     No.     Ja.     No.     Yes.     And chased up whatever information he wanted me to chase up.     Ja.     Ja.  Except for Table 1 where he explained to me how to put the table ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Ja, it is a record of the ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Possible, ja.     Ja.     I do not know what the sub ...[intervenes]      You are talking about the information in the table?     Well, they would have had a quote because that information came from the quote.  So they would have had it with them.     It was the calculation or a reconciliation.     That was the objective and the memo was to request ...[intervenes]      ...permission to ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      I was not justifying anything.  Mr Singh was preparing the memo.     That is what Mr Singh was doing.     [No audible reply]      I do not think so.  I mean, where I did not know what was happening in the memo, he would have... he got inputs and he would provide instruction to the other sections of the memo which needed to come from other areas.     Ja.     Look, obviously I did not work in that department.  I did not work for him.  I was working at Freight Rail.  I was working in another office in Park Town. They were working in Carlton Centre.   I got called to come and do these edits and to chase people up to get information for the memo.  I suppose it was just... it felt like it was just a job that I needed to do based on the instruction of my superior.     Ja.     No.  I do not recall being wary.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Right.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Those were the two parameters, yes.     Yes.     Ja.     That was the parameters, ja.     Ja.     Ja.     So yes, we do know how the figures were arrived at.  I mean, if you go to table 1 the elements are explained in terms of the foreign exchange was arrived at, would be changing the EN rate and that was a 10.7% increase in EN rate, so that is 10.7 increase from the business case to the point in time when the contract was signed.     Same would be for the escalation.  It would be the escalation relating to indices over that point in time.     Why do you say controversial?       Ja but this is – these exchange rates are a given.  So, I mean, you have it in the business case and you have the exchange rate at the date of [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     I disagree.     Yes.     Well, it is not a justification, it is a calculation and it is standard way of doing a walk forward.  So it is not something that is new, it is standard financial way of doing things.     And you would normally do that always.     Mr Callard is not a financial expert, so I mean we do walk forwards in this way, we call it a walk forward, at the end of the day it is semantics, walk forward, walk backwards and I explained yesterday how a walk forward is done and that is a standard way you do a walk forward.     Alright, page?     Ja.     Ja.     So that would be like the US dollar rate example.     No, no, no, no.     I am saying could have been or could other currencies involved and he is saying the business case is based in yen.     Yes.     I cannot – I mean, the business case was based in yen, it is fait accompli [intervenes]     The contract was meant to be done in rands.     So – and that is what was finally agreed upon, in rands.     So the initial price, when I was doing my calculation, my reasonability was based on the CSR price which would have had a dollar element and you will see it in my calculation.     And that is why I asked that question.     Yes.     No, I did not.     That is not unreasonable.     Because the price of the 20E was based in US dollar.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.  Ja, and a few other currencies.     Yes.     US Dollar as well as rand, portion.     Yes.     10.7% increase.     I will go to table 1 to see what it is.  On what page is table 1?  R3.6 million.  I think 3.6 [indistinct – dropping voice]     R3.6 million rounded.     Ja.     Yes.     I did not do that calculation.     No.     The standard way of doing a walk forward is to, as I explained yesterday, was to work on what you were given.  So you were given the rand/yen rate, which was included in the business case which is fait accompli, as I said in my statement yesterday as well.  I was not involved in the business case, so I cannot explain why the business case was based in yen but from a financial principle perspective you start with what you are given and the rand/yen rate was what was given and that is why you used the rand/yen rate.     It would just complicate …[intervenes]     You could, ja, but it expose the calculation to miscalculation.     You could do the calculation.     Ja, you could do the calculations but …[intervenes]     Not necessarily, I mean, we cannot say it is the correct currency.  As I say, when you do a walk forward you work with what was given.     So it is more correct to use what you were given rather than to make assumptions and use something that you are not given.     That is a separate calculation completely.       Correct, ja.     Ja.     Sorry, I do not have lines in my…     I see 10 and 20 – oh, you mean...     Ja but it is a financial principle which I agree with.     I do not know if I was shocked.  I do not think I was shocked.     Yes.     No.     Ja.     That was the offer that was put on the table [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     No.     Sorry, 512?       It is party, ja.     Ja, when bidders provide their pricing they provide a payment profile as well.     When bidders provide pricing they provide a payment profile as well.     It was part of the submission by the bidders per negotiations, yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes.     As part of the negotiation process, Chair, you started off at a point obviously and then bidders would submit proposals over a point of time.  When we started the negotiations remember there were many issues we had to deal with.  Those issues related to the reduction of the batch increase in cost per escalation, the forex portion, the use of TE, etcetera.  That pricing was not part of the evaluation and was only provided during the negotiation phase, correctly or incorrectly. Now when they submitted their proposals as part of the negotiation phase, they would have submitted proposal with revised pricing now for inclusion of those elements as well as payment terms related to those proposals over a period of time and as part of the negotiation process.  They would negotiated different payment terms with different payment terms with different prices, so it was a part of a negotiation.     My understanding is the locomotives were meant to be delivered over a shorter period of time and the initial evaluation was much longer period of time.  So because it was a shorter period of time they needed higher advanced payment to set up the infrastructure.     That is the basis upon which they provided.     Total advance payments for all these – all the different bidders …[intervenes]     I cannot remember the exact number but possibly …[intervenes]     Ja.     I guess he was not part of the negotiations, he did not know the process that was done in order to get there.  As I say, it was a process of give and take and this is what they were proposing, if you want us to deliver quicker, you have got to give us bigger advance payments that we can bring our infrastructure here a bit quicker.     Yes.     Ja.  Mr Chair, the 1.62% was based on the initial bid proposals that we came to as part of the tender process that were evaluated right up front, so this was part of the 2013 proposal that came through.  The final 30% was post the negotiation process.  So through the negotiation process the bidders wanted more upfront advance payments in order to set up their manufacturing facility.     Ja.     Yes, Chair, so upfront it would have been a percentage of the bigger batch.  So, remember, it was – in the valuations it was a full batch of 599.  When we were doing the negotiations it is half a batch so therefore, there  is that portion to take care of as well as well as the negotiations in terms of because you want a quicker delivery we need more cash upfront so that we can setup our manufacturing facilities quicker and that was the negotiations.     You need a  – I mean, it is a bigger percentage, it is a bigger …[intervenes]     So mathematically, I suppose, and I am just trying to work this out in my head, 1% of a million is a certain amount …[intervenes]     You would need more upfront.      To setup the production facilities upfront and also just part – I think maybe it was part of a …[intervenes]     It would be probably the same production facility.     It is the time period over which you are doing it.     Ja because now the batch is cut and the time period for delivery is also cut.     Ja.     As I say, it was part of the negotiation process …[intervenes]     Ja.     So part of the process – and that is the explanation that was given to us by the bidders, that we need further amount upfront so that we can setup our production facility and also, if you give us more upfront, there is a discount in the price as part of the negotiation process.  So that is what they would have told us when we did the negotiations. At the end of the day it was not me that accepted the proposal, it was obviously the steering committee that accepted the proposal that came from the bidders.  It was still something we were negotiating.     So yes, it was recordal but I also pointed out anomalies.  As per my evidence yesterday, I pointed out a number of anomalies as part of the negotiation process and I raised those anomalies, as I said yesterday, with the batch pricing.  I raised the issue the manner it was in that and I raised the issue that we need to go back and evaluate because then we have a more market-related issue around the best pricing.  I raised the issue around the escalation so yes, I also raised these anomalies during the process, the spreadsheets for the outcome of the final pricing. ADV MYBURGH     Ja.     Yes.     I do.     Ja.     Yes, ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Right, I do deal with the anomaly in my statement, so specifically we look at 28.4, I did raise the issue about local content directly with Mr Jayne and Ms Maltese and I made it known to them that based on the pricing that has been offered, these bidders are not going to meet the local content requirements.     Ja.     I am saying I did in my statement.  I do not think we covered it yesterday but it was in [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes.     Right, right.     I did provide an explanation in my statement and I raised the issue.  I think it is in one of the paragraphs in my statement.     Well, as per my statement yesterday you will see that that particular sheet meant nothing, it was an illustrative calculation and it did not go anywhere.  It was purely illustrative calculation to see where we started and where we ended, so that sheet meant nothing.     Ja.     Ja.     In my statement I said I did tell them I was bound by a confidentiality agreement.     That I was bound by a confidentiality agreement.     Ja, I think I did say that in my statement, ja.     Ja.     And I say I did.     Ja.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Myburgh? 
MYBURGH:  You would have had to exercise judgment?   Yes but you were party to the negotiations. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but the point that I make is, it does not answer the question.  It does not answer the concern.  In other words, you – and you must correct me if I am wrong.   You come to learn of this which is substantially in access of your reason-ability calculation.  You say you are surprised.   You say to Singh.  But this is more than Mitsui.  He     Just answer my question.  You said to him.  You compared it to Mitsui.  You said this is too expensive or ...[intervenes]     Or it is beyond what they had offered.  He said we have already agreed to go CSR.  That does not answer the question, does it?     Okay.     I see.     Well, you see there is an example of Mr Singh just blowing you off.  Did you think you were going     Yes.     Yes.     You know the history about Mitsui?     But did you know it at the time?     You have come to known of it?     Alright.  So you raise your concern.      Well, the chairperson is part of a team.     Yes, but I mean, he is part of the meeting.  Correct?     Right.  So there you are.  The co-chairperson is here.     Is that right?     Jiyane and Singh.     Okay.  And do that... the two of them report into the sub-committee?     And that sub-committee comprises the two of them and Mr Molefe?     Ah!  Okay.  So Mr Singh does not tell you that the sub-committee has agreed to the R 44 million?  He just tells you that Molefe has agreed to the R 44 million.     Mr Laher, he does not tell you that we as the sub-committee have agreed on R 44 million.  He tells you – and you must understand.  Your evidence is important for other ...[intervenes]     ...parts of this inquiry.     It is not just a matter of exonerating yourself.     He tells you that Mr Molefe had agreed.     Now that must have been strange to you?     So you did not think this was strange?     So you thought... you were surprised only by the price?     Alright.  At paragraph 30, where you     And this is where the accounting team quite correctly identified that CSR was using the wrong exchange rate.     Correct?     Now that was your job.     To identify things like that.     You came up with this point.     And this is when you say, four lines     Were you persuaded by that?     Just... I am asking you Mr Laher.  Please, do not get ahead of yourself.  I well aware of the next sentence and you know that I am going to take you there.       Could we concentrate on my question, if you do not mind?     You raise a line item with him.  It is the accountant in you coming out.     That is why you are there.     Yes. “His response was to advise me that it is a negotiation process on final price and on the context of negotiation, it is the overall final price that is important.”     Were you persuaded by that?     Yes. “He explained that the pricing was acceptable in light of the rigorous negotiation process and the risk.” It is... we are going to come to that but let me deal with this theory.  Because, just bearing in mind, you say this in many other parts of your affidavit. That is why I do not know why you are hesitant.     In fact, I think, it appears three times, does it not?     Where you say    It is your own testimony before this Commission.     But that is wrong.  That you need to interrogate the constituent parts.     Do you want me to take you to those places?     You know of them.     So here, when he told you it is all about the final price, you knew that in your mind not to be right.      I am asking you.  Your own evidence before this Commission.  Is it wrong, as far as you are concerned, to focus on the overall price.  You must look at the constituent components.  In fact, you are critical of Singh and Jiyane on that basis, correct?     Right.  So you were not persuaded when he said look at the overall price, correct?     But how could you have been persuaded when those passages in your affidavit say this is the very mistake my principles made?     Then it was not a mistake Mr Laher.  I mean, you cannot have it both ways here.      That in the next sentence?     But you would accept that taken in isolation, this idea that negotiations were all about the final price.  That does not record with your own view of life, does it?     As an accountant?     In fact, it is nonsense, is it not?     Yes.  Okay.  But why you were persuaded is.  He said he explained that the pricing was acceptable in the light of the rigorous negotiation.  You have been involved in the negotiation process.     I mean, you knew that rigour or otherwise.  And the risk that the bidders were prepared to accept.     So what?  They were still using the wrong exchange rate.     You could have potentially say R 2.4 million.  Correct?     But somehow, you were just persuaded by this answer.     Ja but ...[intervenes]      Yes, but you did not test this with them.  You see that is the problem.  I mean, I understand what you say.  But you were in the negotiations.  You have not described them as particularly rigorous.  Did you ...[intervenes]      Why did you not go to them and say    You did that?     Well, that does not seem to appear here.     You do not raise that in your statement here.       You understand how that might be seen as a bit opportunistic because so far we are testing ...[intervenes]      ...you going to Mr Singh.     And Mr Singh giving you answers that plicate you.  Now you say that you actually raised this issue with Mr Singh, does not agree with during the negotiations.     Did you raise this issue during negotiations?  Because remember, Mr Singh does not agree with this.     I see.  So there is no issue then of subordination?     Yes.  My question is.  Why do you not say you raised this in the negotiations?     Okay.  Perhaps I have missed that.  I am talking really about the R 2.4 million.     And the foreign exchange fluctuations.     Yes.  Did you raise that?     Okay.  Now let us go back to Mr Singh.  Are you seriously suggesting that you were persuaded by his answer?     Well, you have accepted that negotiations about overall price.  Were you persuaded that these negotiations are so rigorous and they have assumed so much risk that they will not entertain using the correct foreign exchange?     Please, just answer my question.  I mean, were you at such a breaking point that you could not push this issue?  Is that what you say?     But then why did not... why was this not raised?  Why was the point not taken further?     I am asking you.  Why was this not pressed in the negotiations?     I see.       Thank you.  Explain to me the concerns you have articulated in your statements about the chairpersons having, as you put it, focussed incorrectly on the overall price instead of the constituent parts because this really goes to that.  Explain that criticism to the Chairperson.     Why did you consider that to be wrong?  Why are you critical of the chairpersons?     Yes, you would have preferred that.     That would have been the correct way to do it, presumable, from your point of view.     Yes.  So that is... you understand why I questioned you in relation to this particular issue?  Because this went to the very criticism that you have of how the chairpersons ran the negotiations.     But you get this answer from Mr Singh and you just leave it.       But you were not persuaded because you believed that you needed to look at each of the components of price.  That is your own case.  Do you want me to read that to you?     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.  So you say in your main     Yes. “The effect of this was that much of these components was self-standing components of the negotiations.  In the end, it was the overall price that they focussed on.”     And negotiating in that way has its dangers, does it not?     Perhaps you could articulate those dangers to the Chairperson.     Yes.  Well, I assumed what you were going to is, because you came in that way artificially increased prices.  Correct?  If you do not, as you correctly put it, rigorously interrogate each of these things, you can hide R 5 million here or R 10 million there.  Correct?     That is the danger of not negotiating in a way that you describe.     Yes.  That is why it is very important to press these types of issues, is it not?     And Mr Singh persuaded you on the basis that you have explained.     Correct?     I see.  Now did you ever say to Mr Singh, because this is your central criticism of the chairpersons.   What you have not already told the Chairperson is that at a certain point in time, that you met with the chairpersons and said, with all respect, the way that you are negotiating is wrong.  It does not rest well with me.  We are not interrogating the constituent components of this offer.   Now we know that is what you believed.     Did you say that to them?     What do you mean you cannot recall Mr Laher?  Did... I mean, this was your central problem that you had.  As I understand it.   You sat there from an accounting perspective and you looked at what was going on and you looked comfortable because they were not interrogating the components.   Now, surely, you would remember as to whether or not you took this leap of addressing them on this issue.     Well, the I assume you did not.     That is the most you would have done.  Why did you not tackle this?  Because what you explain in your affidavit is that it seems to me that a fundamental difficulty with the manner in which these negotiations were being run.  Why did you not tackle it head on?     But we know that... I mean, I have made a list of your concerns.  There is six of them.     None of them involved this material issue.  I mean, this is central to the whole in which you were conducting your job.  I mean, you were there as an accountant.  That was your job, presumable.       To interrogate the lineout.     Right?     Now the chairpersons were not conducting the negotiations in that way.  You have told the DCJ, the Chairperson of this inquiry that it is wrong to do that and that that potentially can lead to price inflation.  This is a big issue for you as a chartered accountant, correct?     Yet, you do not say, with all respect, I must put my foot down.  You do not do that.     But Mr Laher, you just told the Chairperson at the outset that you did not want to push things too far because you were scared of insubordination.  Did you put your foot down, yes or no, in relation to this?     No.  Okay so then, why did you not?  Because this is what you were doing there.  The whole modus operandi on your evidence was wrong.  Why did you not put your foot down?     Alright.  Now at paragraph 32.  Here we are dealing with the exchange fluctuations.  And it is important.  And you have pointed out something to me which I did not or might have forgotten.  Of course, we are dealing here with you believe that the cost was too high.     Ja, 30, 31, 32.     And you knew it was too high because you had done your own reasonability calculation.     But... So you are coming from that perspective, really, when you learn of the R 44 million.  As I understand, it was just a matter of a short time before you had done your own accounting sum.     And it would come to R 41 million.     So you were better placed than anyone to know that this actually was too high.     Yes.     You know that?     Okay.  So at 32    You deferred to him, telling you that negotiations are all about the final price because of his expertise, experience and ability.     Yes.  But look, Mr Laher.  I do not want to be uncharitable to you but you also had skills.  You also had seniority, experience, expertise and ability.  Correct?  And all those things took you to say to him that the price is too high.     That is why I am struggling to understand and I think the Chairperson has touched on it and I am not going to belabour it but it is not a case where this is not your field.   This is your field.  You had done the accounting.  You had got to R 41 million.  You were no really surprised that Mr Molefe had agreed to R 44 million.   But you land up, on the basis of this answer, just deferring to him.     Mr Laher, there is no reference here you rigorous debate.  Please.  You draft... I mean, this is an important statement that has been drafted.     You do not even talk about, let alone rigorous, you say nothing about debate.       You are now saying here you had a rigorous debate with Mr Singh.     When you started out your evidence this morning, the record will show that you adopted the position that you actually did not want to have a rigorous debate with Mr Singh because you think you might insubordinate yourself.       So where are we then?     A rigorous debate was held despite no reference being made here.     Debate was...     You did not have concerns about insubordination?     So tell us then.  Let us explain the debate.  Let us go through it.       Yes.     Carry on.     And you described that as a debate?     You see, Mr Laher.  Even on your own version, you raised a concern and he gave the answer in these two lines and you were placated.  I mean, you have basically repeated what you have in your statement.  Correct?     I see.  Well, let us carry on.  Now what happens is that you become in part the author of what we can refer to as the Singh memorandum.  Correct?     Now you, if I recall your evidence correctly, you were very surprised... [voice trails off]  You were surprised that Mr Singh choice you to perform this task.     Is that right?     And presumable must have trusted you.     Correct?     Were there lots of other people that he could have asked.     But he choice you.     Right?     Now, I understand entirely the edits that were made.  I have looked carefully at the notes at Annexure YL15.  But I mean, there seems to be to be substantial parts of that memorandum that you would have authored yourself.       Ja.  Sorry, can you just answer my question?  Are there substantial parts of the memorandum that you have authored yourself?     Alright.  So you given a draft and you work it up and key then amends(?).     What we need to know which is important is, do you take ownership then of that memorandum?  Do you accept that you were ultimately the author with the input of Mr Singh?     Okay what are you saying?  That you performed simply a secretarial function?     But then why ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Yes but are you saying, you authored none of that memorandum? MR     So you performed – and it is important.  We just need to know.     You performed simply a secretarial function?     Yes.  We are going to come to Table 1.       So apart from – because of course, Table 1 is the critical thing, is it not?     Right.     That is really what I wanted to get at.     Table 1 is critical.     As for the rest, you were playing the role of a secretary.     Okay.  Now you knew that what you... what Mr Singh was trying to do, was to provide really an expo facto explanation for the increase to R 44 million per locomotive.     Correct?     And what is important is that that memorandum took a substantial amount of time to draft, did it not?  Or to finalise.     In fact, it seems, it is closer to two months and one month.  Would you agree?     So there is... the picture that you paint is that there is a backwards and forwarding between you and Mr Singh for up to two months.       There is a gathering of information.  There is an exercise of the mind in relation to Table A.     So I take it then, the Chairperson can accept that Mr Molefe and the sub-committee did not have that information on tab at the time that the R 44 million was agreed to?  They did not have on tab, did they?     No, you do know.  Because if they had on tab, then you would have been given the information and you could have just drafted Table A and the memorandum could have been immediately.  Correct?     Yes.     Yes.  But the point is that it was an expo facto justification.  Correct?     Well, the point is.  You now have to justify an explain a decision that had already been made.  That is perhaps a more accurate way of putting it, correct?     Yes.     You accept that I say?     You were trying to justify the increased to 44 which had already been agreed.     Yes, but you knew that was Mr Singh was doing.     Right.  And did that not make you... do you not feel uneasy about being involved in this process?  I mean, already you were concerned about the price.       Were you not concerned about involvement with this memorandum?     That is not my question.  I mean, you yourself say you are surprised that he choice you.     Were you not a little bit wary about this task?     Did you feel... and again Mr Laher, you have done everything but answer my question.     Were you not wary about engaging in this task?  You do not even tell us about the Carlton Centre, to answer that question.     Alright.  Well, then that is the answer.       You were not wary.     You were surprised though that he choice you.     Okay.  Then the memorandum is produced.  Let us then go to... it is Table 1.  I am sorry.  I am wrong when I referred you to A, Table 1 is at 553, is that right?     So that is how one gets to the 44 million.     And for example what you would find at A, that is the column next to the rand.     That deals with the exchange rate.     And we know these are the constituent parts that caused the increase, right?     And you say that in the process of putting together the memorandum and table 1 that Mr Singh asked you to do a so-called walk forward.     Now if I could ask you please to go     “The walk forward would entail  taking the price as reflected in the business case of 34 million and adding or subtracting any elements that impact the price to that price in order to end up at the final contracted price.”     that is what you had to do.     You had to go from 34 million to 44 million.     You had to ensure that.     Yes.  But because, of course, Mr Molefe had already agreed on that.     It might have been two months before.     That is what you had to do.  You had to balance the books.     Yes, precisely.  So let us then go; and have a look at what Mr Callard had to say.  You have considered his transcript, I have provided you with there.     You know that he has given evidence already in relation to your Rule 3.4 statement and Mr Callard’s transcript or transcript of his evidence you find – if you go to page 791 of bundle 4B.  You find it directly after that, it starts at 791.1.  Are you there?     There is just one or two passages that I want to take you to.  Let us go please to page 791.30.  I want to take you just to three parts and he is     Yes.     But all of those were controversial decisions made during the course of negotiation.     Well, I mean, we have touched on the exchange rate already.     So you do not agree with what Mr Callard said?     Then let us have a look at page 791.32 at paragraph or line 12. “I have not come across that methodology in the past.” He is talking about the walk forward.   “It is most unusual, highly unusual.  In fact I would go so far as to say irregular because we are now trying to justify a price which has been given as he mentioned in his statement earlier, that he was given the price.  He is now trying to justify the price as in a walk forward.” I think you have accepted that your walk forward had to get you from 34 to 44.     So he is saying well, you are just simply trying to justify, you knew where you had to go to.     But the point is it was being done ex post facto, you had to get to 44.     I see.  Then if we go please to page     Alright.  Then let us please go back to your statement.  And I am going to deal with the next thing that Mr Callard deals with and that is the forex issue.     And this you deal with at page 510 in paragraph 36, it is quite a lengthy paragraph, as you know.  I think it is that part of the paragraph that you find at page 511.  Are you there?     So you say at the top    A few lines down you say    Yes, when you say there were other currencies involved, what did you mean?  Were you saying well, I said to him look, we should be using the US dollar?     What did you say?     Ja.     But is this an – why did you not say to why are we not using the US dollar?     Sorry, can you just answer my question?  Did you say to him why are we not using the US dollar?     Okay.     Right.  So when you say I pointed out that there would be other – sorry, more than one currency involved did you mean rand and something else?  Or did you mean...?     Yes, I saw it.     So when you did your re-stability calculation that is where you used US dollar.     Did you raise with Mr Singh the prospect of rather using a US dollar in this context or not?     And then he says    When you did your re-stability calculation why did you use US dollar and not yen?     So CSR is a Chinese company?     Not a Japanese company.    And their prices are based on US dollar, as I understand, from what you say.      Yes but in this instance we were using the US dollar.     In your mind.     No, that I...  So using the US – sorry, using the yen as the rand/yen rate we know that that came at something of a price.  I think we have already looked at table 1.     How much was it?     And that translated into how much in rand?     Sorry?     3.6 million per locomotive?     So that was quite a large part of the increase from 34 to 44.     Did you ever do a calculation as to what the difference would have been if you used the rand/US dollar rate?     Do you know whether it would have been offhand more or less?     Alright.  So let us just then go to Mr Callard again please and I will ask you to go to page 791.37.  This is where he deals with this issue and perhaps I can take you forward to page 44.     791.44, Mr Chairperson.     At line 13.  Mr Callard says    But there was no reason why you could not use the rand/dollar rate if you chose to.     But you could.     But you could do the calculation.     That is why they had smart people like you there.     Yes and then you could trace it into the future using the correct currency.     Yes.     Yet when you did your calculations you used the dollar.     But your answer is yes.      Alright.  Then the next page 791.45, line 19.     What he says is …[intervenes]     Line 19.     On the left hand side.     You do have them, I can see them from here, Mr …[intervenes]     20, so it is the line above. “Secondly, in that explanation I can pick up from Mr Laher ’s statement for the continued use of the yen was that Mr Singh explained the assumption and I take that as guidance from Mr Singh.” So you took guidance from him there.     Let us then deal with the advanced payments which is the next thing that Mr Callard deals with.  Now Mr Callard says that he was shocked when he came to learn of amongst others a 30% advanced guaranteed payment to CSR.  Were you shocked when you came to learn of that?     Well, let me just take you to the extent of it and we can break for tea.  Could you please go to the transcript 791.57.  At the foot of the page .57, he says when he came to learn of this he then sent an SMS to finance people.     Did you get this SMS?     And the SMS read – over the page    You were not shocked, were you surprised?     No, I am asking you were you surprised that it was agreed to?     Mr Chairperson, could we break for tea?     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Laher, we are dealing with the advance payments.  Could I ask you please to go to page 501 of bundle 4B?  At paragraph 40 you say that you were not involved in the management of Transnet’s cash or funding, 512.     And then it says    So you sat there and there was a negotiation around these advanced payments?     So could I take you please to …[intervenes]     Now I want to take you to Mr Callard’s statement that was attached to the 3.3 notice, that is right at the beginning of the file and could I ask you please to turn to page 503.37.  Perhaps we can start at 503.38.  Do you see at 147 there is a table, the table below is compiled from annexure 17 and if you look at the     Then at 148    So there we know that CSR was     And that then increased, did it not?     To a whopping 30%.      And at 149 Mr Callard says    But I think my question is, how does one get to a situation where the advanced payment was twenty times more than what they initially asked for?     Twenty times more?     And you know that that – what was the cost then to Transnet?  It was then paid out, was it some R7 billion or something?  You would know.     7 billion.     Without anything being delivered on a contract?     Now Mr Callard who has, as you know, has been around this industry for a long time, was truly shocked when he came to learn of this amount.  Do you want to comment on that?     Alright.     No but if it is half a batch, why would you need fifteen times more advance payment?  Surely it works the other way around?     Why?  It is half the batch.     I am not ask you that.  Why would you need fifteen times more because you are delivering half a batch?     Why?     But you would need a bigger production facility and you would need more cash if you were producing double batch.     Well, precisely.     So now it is down to time?     But still, why do you need fifteen times more advance payment?  I mean, we are not talking about double.     We are talking about potentially fifteen times more.  How is that possible?     Yes, no, we of course know that that does not answer the question.  You style yourself as an eyewitness, you were there.     So tell us what happened in these negotiations that caused someone to agree to 30% advance payment that causes Mr Callard to be shocked, someone who has been around this industry, who sees this as an outlier.       Yes, thank you.  Then I just want to deal with two other things.  The spreadsheets – let me just take you perhaps directly to what Mr Callard’s criticism of your answer is so we can short circuit some of this.  Could you go back to the transcript please at page 791.83?     83.     What Mr Callard says at line 16, is     Yes, that is correct, perhaps if I can pursue that.     Let me take you to Mr Callard’s statement that is attached to the 3.3 notice.  At the beginning of the file, page 503.57.  Now we know that Mr Callard deals with this at paragraph 208 but let me just give you two examples. 8.4 Mr Callard says – and here he is dealing with     But that is not the point, he says    He says well, you do not address that.     You simply say – well, this is what he is saying.     I am giving you an opportunity.     He saying the best answer you have is you simply record what the bidders said.     And he says in so doing you are not answering or dealing with the anomaly.     What is your response to that?     Yes but you – you again, Mr Callard’s point, he says in your answers to my concerns about the spreadsheet, all you say in relation to this is you record what the bidders said, but I pointed out an anomaly, which you have not dealt with.     Do you accept that you did not deal with the anomaly nor are you saying you did?     In dealing with paragraph 208.4?     Well, we will come to that.  And then at paragraph …[intervenes]     Alright and then let us go, for example, to 208.6.   “The diesel negotiated price recon worksheet contains inexplicable discounts on exchange rate impact and escalation.”  What do you say to that?     And then last thing that I want to just deal with is the reconciliation of the business case and this is the paragraph where Mr Callard states that he did not think you were forthcoming with the information.     Now you would have read the transcript.  Perhaps I can again just take you directly to what Mr Callard’s concern ultimately seems to have been.      What do you say to that?     No.  Okay, well I mean, his point is …[intervenes]     You told Mr Callard that?     Well, he seems to indicate from his perspective – and I must just put his version to you.     That you did not do that.     You disagree?     Mr Chairperson, we have no further questions, thank you.     Yes, Chairperson, I had asked that we adjourn now and then reconvene tomorrow to hear the evidence of Mr Mahlangu.     Mr Mahlangu is available at nine o’clock if you would prefer to get an earlier start, it being a Friday, but we are entirely in your hands.     Thank you, Chairperson.     I am confident that he will – we should be completed with his evidence by lunchtime. 
LAHER: I would have captured his wording ...[intervenes]
