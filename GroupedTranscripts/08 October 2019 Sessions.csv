CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning, good morning everybody.  Before we start I just want to deal with something else and then we will continue.      You may be seated.  Thank you.  In the business day of Friday the 4 t h October 2009 an article appeared on the front page which was titled and I quote “Zuma to get preview of nuke-deal questions”  In that article the Business Day said that the commission had sent former President Mr Jacob Zuma questions that he would be asked when he next appears in the commission.  It referred to the fact that prior to his appearance before the commission last time former President – the former President had asked that he be furnished with the questions that he would be asked once he was in the witness desk – on the witness stand and that I as Chairperson had made a decision to refuse that he be furnished with questions in advance.The article goes on to say that the commission had sent Mr Zuma’s lawyers eleven pages with 80 questions.  When you read the whole article it certainly gives the impression that the commission has changed its decision on the question of whether Mr Zuma should befurnished questions before he – before he appears before the commission.  Since then I think another newspaper has published the same article.  The fact of the matter is the commission has not sent Mr Zuma’s lawyers any questions.  The – there is a document which has eleven pages and I saw that in the article there is a reference to eleven pages.  There is a document with eleven pages that was sent by Mr Paul Pretorius to counsel for Mr Zuma.  That document contains areas of interest in the various affidavits that had previously been given to Mr Zuma as the affidavits from which questions would arise.  That document was in accordance with the agreement that was reached on the 19 t h July 2019 which was the last day of Mr Zuma’s appearance before the commission that week.  The terms of that agreement were announced publicly by myself.  Counsel for Mr Zuma and the head of the commission’s legalteam Mr Pretorius were asked after I had announced the terms to confirm whether those were the terms of the agreement.They stood up here in public and confirmed that those were the terms of the agreement.  Anyone who listened to the terms of the agreement as I announced them or anyone who wishes to listen to the recording of that day will know that there is nothing – there was nothing to say Mr Zuma would be sent questions.  That same day after the proceedings had been adjourned some of the TV stations began to say in their reporting that the commission was now going to send Mr Zuma questions and some of them wereraising questions as to why he had not been given questions when he had asked for them before the hearing.Either the same day or the following day but I believe the same day the commission issued a media statement clarifying this that the terms of the agreement did not include that Mr Zuma would be given questions in advance that he would be asked when he takes the witness stand.I am aware that some – one or more of the TV stations did correct and said no we got it wrong.  The arrangement is not that he is going to be given questions.  One would have thought that with that background it would have been clear that the commission still stood on the position that the former President would not be given questions in advance that he would be asked once he takes the witness stand.I subsequent to me being aware of this article in the BusinessDay I asked Mr Paul Pretorius to please give me the document once again that he had sent to counsel for Mr Zuma.  And before that he told me that there were no questions that he had sent. He gave me the document again and I could not see any questions.  All I could see was an indication of areas in various affidavits or incidents or events in which the legal team was saying they were interested so that he could deal with those issues in the affidavits contemplated in the agreement that I announced.I thought it is important that I set the record straight because I do not know why on the basis of the document that we know it is saidthat we have sent questions to Mr Zuma when a mere reading of the document will show that really there are no questions.I will cause that document to be released to the public either today or at the latest tomorrow so that the public can see for itself that there were no questions that were sent.  That is the eleven page document that I am talking about.  I do not know whether there might be an eleven page document elsewhere that has been manufactured by somebody else and has presented it to the media as coming from us, the commission but the eleven page document that we have does not have – does not give Mr Zuma questions.  It indicates the areas on which questions will arise but not the actual questions.We – we appeal to the media to please just check the affects and to be fair to everybody including the commission.  I spoke some time earlier this year about an article that had been published by theSunday Independent in regard to Mr Nombembe who is Head of the Commission’s investigation team where in the article it was alleged that – or somebody had alleged that he had done certain things because he wanted to be appointed as NDPP and I said then I cannot understand how any newspaper would publish that story when the editor must know and I would have expected the journalist concerned to have known that to be NDPP you need to have at least a legal degree and Mr Nombembe does not have a legal degree.  He is an auditor.  But that was published.I think that the media must realise that when they do not checktheir facts properly or when they do some things that are difficult to understand to the ordinary reader that might give rise to all kinds of suspicions and we do not need any unnecessary suspicions to be associated with the media.  The media plays a very important role and they need to be respected, their rights need to be respected. Journalists do generally speaking a very good job.  Society relies on them.  We would like to be able to know that they do their job with the necessary professionalism.  So we just ask that we be treated fairly as the commission just like we say everybody should be treated fairly.  But in order to make sure that the side of the story of the commission is known arrangements will be made for us – we will make arrangements to release the document that was sent to the lawyers for the former President the only eleven page document that I know about that will be released.Thank you very much.  We can now proceed.    Yes you are still under oath Mr Zuma.  Good morning.    Yes.  Okay alright.    I think there may be confusion with the changes that were made in the numbering and the labelling.  Maybe Mr Mokoena should just check that you have your files are labelled the same way as his in terms of the latest labelling.    Oh.    Okay, okay.  LL1B.    Ja there is a 1.    Okay and what page did you say?    That is the red numbers – page numbers.    As – yes.    Well - well …    Before he answers.  I must just say that he described his role in that meeting as almost a spectator or - or mediator.    Ja.    Yes.    No, no …    Yes.    No.  I do not have a problem with that.  It is just that it - I gained the impression that - that it was as if it is other people who described his role as (intervenes).    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Ja.    No that is fine, ja.    Please raise your voice Mr Zuma.    Hm.    Okay.  Well is that one about which he had - we hadproblems yesterday.    A.    Is that not the page that - did not have a statement from my side.    Ja, but it is …    It is fine.  You can continue.    No.  I have seen it, yes.    I have seen it.    Has got it.    Yes.  No that is fine.    Yes.    Ja.  I think that is fine.  Let us - let us probably it should not be a problem.    We will have to …    We will have to make it - put in as a …    Hm.  Well maybe …    Maybe let us just make is a separate exhibit on its own - as his exhibit.    Ja.  So this was LL.  Mr Mokoena will be hearing me.  He might be able to suggest.  It should be LL …   LL2.    Oh we have got LL2.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.  So it should be LL3.    LL8.  This is one article?    It is one article.  Okay.  The - and it is the article from the Sunday Times?  Where is it from?   Okay.  So this will be - this article - Sunday Times article of 13 March 2016 will be marked EXHIBIT LL8.    Oh.  Is it 13 March?    Oh.  No I thought I said the 13 t h but let me(intervenes).    The 13 t h ja.  No.  I said - I think I said the 13 t h, ja.    Okay.    Yes.    Well - I am - I am sorry.  What would have come across as Mcebisi was Msebenzi.    Ja.  Mcebisi is Mr Jonas’ name.   Msebenzi might be somebody else.     Yes you can make your point.     Please just repeat the page number?    742.     No thank you very much.  I suspect that Mr Mokoena wishes to say something but I think we must take the tea adjournment now.  I will also have maybe a few questions to put to you Mr Zuma.  I can mention that I did share with your counsel, the legal team that there are other statements in which you have been mentioned in regardto meetings other than the ones that you have been asked about and – but the arrangement is that – my impression, or my understanding is that those would have been sent to you before but your legal team was not sure whether they were sent or whether they received them.  So the arrangement is that the Commission’s legal team will look at whether they were sent and be in touch with your legal team and if there is a need for you to deal with them in one way or another there will be discussions around that, that may or may not entail a request that you come back but both legal teams will look at all issues and you will hear from your legal team about those.  So I thought I would just mention that for now.     Yes but I realise that you don’t want to see me again.  We are going to take the tea adjournment it’s twenty-six minutes past eleven, we’ll resume at twenty to twelve, we adjourn.INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes Mr Mokoena.    Okay no that is alright.  And I think you must maybe use this opportunity to tell me what happened to the discussions that you were supposed to have with Mr Zuma’s legal team about the issue that he raised yesterday.  I think he was saying there was some omission.    And I said the legal teams will talk and then I would be updated – I would be – I would get a report back this morning about whether it is something that I need to know or what the position is.    Okay.    Well if there is no – no issue and whatever he might have been – had in mind is sorted then that would be fine.    But I think Mr Louw will or wishes to say something. Maybe let us clear that and that before you continue.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    No that is fine. Thank you.    Okay no thank you.  Mr Zuma I have just a few questions to clarify certain things.    Yes.    Yes.    No that is fine.    But also I must just say when I refer to what Mr Ajay Gupta did I was not necessarily saying that is what you were obliged to do or necessarily should have done.  I was simply saying here is another way in which somebody else who wanted to put his side of the story that he did maybe and I think I put that maybe that is what youshould have considered as well.  So I put it no higher than that.    Ja.    Okay.  Alright.  You referred to drinks or drinking facilities when your counsel asked you I think about your – about the choice to go to the Gupta residence for this meeting among the three of you that is yourself, Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas.  But I did not hear the exact full story of what you say about drinks.  Were you saying that     Sorry yes.    Oh catering facilities.  Well I did say I did not hear the whole story and maybe that is why it is important to clarify.  Just repeat exactly what you were saying about whether it is catering or drinks or whatever.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    No.  Now my difficulty with that is that I would think that in your own house at Saxonwold you would receive friends and if you would receive friends you would offer them drinks so why would – why would the fact that there are catering – there are certain catering facilities at the Gupta residence really be an important factor in the choice of the venue when you were talking about – one of the – the fact that one of these people is your friend, Mr Hlongwane was your friend and the other person was your friend’s friend.  So one would think thatit is normal to have friends.  It is not a large group it is just two people then yourself then it is three people and I would have thought that if you have two or three friends in your own home you can make sure you can afford them drinks like that.  So – or is the position that you did not – you did not entertain friends in your home?  Make me understand.    Yes.    You know at the Gupta residence?    Ja.    Yes./    Yes.    Well this was not as I understand it and you must tell me if my understanding of your evidence is not correct.  My understanding of your evidence suggest that this was not a business meeting.  This was an – a meeting where you sought to afford two friends – friends to themselves not both to you – two friends who had an issue to discuss, a private issue.    Private issue to discuss an opportunity to discuss and it just seems to me that the – there should be no reason why you cannot have two friends in your home who want to discuss a private matter.   Yes but…    Yes.    Hm.  Ja well I would have thought that at least for purposes of that kind of meeting your friend’s friend would be welcome to your home for purposes of this discussion which you had taken trouble to say I want to help them resolve this.    You understand where I am coming from.    Yes.  Yes.  And my – and you must tell me was there a need for any office facilities for this meeting?    Just because you were asked.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes. Oh okay.    Ja.   Yes.    Yes.  No, no that is fine.  I wanted to also mention because you asked yesterday about the commission whether it was investigating or had investigated certain allegations against you.   1. The commission investigates allegations that fall within the terms of reference of the commission but you know there will be all kinds of allegations even in a statement of one witness.  And some will be important for purposes of the commission some might not really be so important for purposes of the commission but might be important to the persons affected.  So the commission might not investigate everything that it is in somebody’s statement but seek to really investigate those thatappear to be material for its own purposes.  So it does that. But I want to take this opportunity to mention to you for what it is worth that Mr Ajay Gupta and Mr Atul Gupta as you know are not participating in any way in these proceedings.  But in regard to Mr Jonas’ evidence Mr Ajay Gupta and Mr Rajesh Gupta I cannot remember about Mr Atul Gupta they filed affidavits in their application for Leave to Cross-examine Mr Jonas and in those affidavits they said what they said and in regard to Mr Ajay Gupta he said on that day he was in his Sandton offices.  He was not at the Gupta residence.  Months back – oh and she – and he said in his affidavit he mentioned the name of a certain ladyand he said that lady who works for his company would corroborate his alibi and he said and other employees but he gave the name of a particular lady.  Many months back I said the investigators must approach that lady and try and get her statement from her.  And – so that if necessary she could come and give evidence to say what she may know about where Mr Ajay Gupta was on the day.  Recently I was told that there were difficulties in – in getting hold of that lady.  So the commission is interested even if the Gupta’s may not be participating if they have placed information before the commission that maybe helpful for the commission to get to the bottom of what happened the commission will investigate that.  I can say that in due course irrespective of whether that lady is found or not in due course probably there will be one or two witnesses who will come to the commission and – and talk about Mr Ajay’s alibi as well as Mr Atul – Mr Ajay Gupta’s alibi, Mr Atul Gupta’s position as well because my understanding is thatit was said that he was out of the country at the time. That is Mr Atul Gupta.  I have given instructions that the investigators must check that.  And if the information that comes out shows that he was out of the country that will be put out here in the public.  If Mr Ajay Gupta the investigations shows that Mr Ajay Gupta was not at the residence at the relevant time that also will be put up here publicly.  So I just want you to – to know that we – we – even with them not participating if they have put information before the commission that might be important for us to establish who was where when what was happening we will look into that. And – and the public will know.  So – but as I say there maybe some allegations that a particular person who is affected might think is important to follow up but the commission might think for its purposes it should not spend more resources on that.  But any affected person should feel free to approach the commission and say there is this allegation that was made about me I would like it to be looked into.  Then the commission might be able to say look we do not think we want to spend more resources on this but if you have anything that you want = that you are able to find bring it.  You know.  So – so – so I mention that just so that  1. You know.  But also I just want the public to know that we are looking at everything. We are looking at everything.  We do not have a version that we want to be proved.  We just want the truth and wherever we might get the evidence.    Okay.  Yes.  Okay the last question that I wanted toask relates to the rumour that gave rise to the meeting.  Is the position that you also did not know any facts in relation to this rumour – all you knew is there was a rumour?    That is the position.  And once – so in other words there was not much information that you were going to be able to give to the two men at the meeting other than this is what is being said in terms of the rumour but I have no further information.    Is that correct?   And once – once Mr Jonas denied having blackmailed Mr Hlongwane was that basically the end of that discussion because nobody had further information?    Yes.    Yes, yes. And on your understanding did Mr Hlongwane believe that Mr Jonas was responsible for – for this rumour or had done what the rumours suggested he had done or was his position that he did not know but want to find out?    Yes. Okay.   Okay.  And did he accept Mr Jonas’ denial as you understood the position at the meeting?  Or did he not accept it.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay alright.  Now your arrest that you talked about when your counsel was leading you – was re-examining you.  Was it solely related to the meeting that took place at the Gupta residence attended by Mr Jonas and yourself and Mr Hlongwane but on his version plus somebody from the Gupta family?  Did it solely relate to that or did it relate to other things as well?    Yes.    Yes.  Did the police ever ask you whether you knew about – knew in advance about any of that somebody from the Gupta family may have made or was the position that they asked you about itand you said there was no such of at that meeting and that was the end?    Either at the time of arrest or subsequently before the charges were withdrawn.  In other words did they – was the position that they – they asked you to confirm that there was an offer made to Mr Jonas such as the one that he gave evidence about and you said there was no such offer and that was the end of their enquiry to you.  Or was there more discussion to try and see whether you knew anything in advance about any offer that was made?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Well I am asking this question because in his statement and in his evidence if I recall correctly Mr Jonas was very clear that at the meeting you and Mr Hlongwane you might not agree but he was clear that you and Mr Hlongwane were very quiet.  He said the – you know you really did not take any active role in this discussion that he was having with the member of the Gupta family that he talkedabout.  So – so I thought that maybe there may be something that in terms of questioning that may have come up.  But it is fine.  Before the commission we have heard persons who have been arrested and charged in circumstances where they have complained that they were being charged in circumstances where there was really no case against them and charges were later withdrawn.  And I have said that I want to see what information the police had and what information the prosecutors had on the basis for which they charged those people.  Because it does not matter who you are.  If the police have got proper evidence and proper grounds to arrest you and the prosecutors havegot proper grounds and proper evidence to charge you they should charge you.  But equally It does not matter who you are if they do not have evidence and proper grounds to arrest or to charge they should not charge.  So it is important that the police use their powers properly.  Now I do not know whether in your case or in the case of the others that I have talked about who have come before the commission whether it was abuse or not abuse. But it is important to simply say I want to see all of that.  So in what I want to see it will include yours in the light of Mr Jonas’ evidence that you were very quiet at that meeting.  You and Mr Hlongwane.  It may well be that there were proper grounds and it may well be that even if there were no proper grounds it was just honest you know exercise of power I do not know.  But I just want to mention that I will want to see everything.  I think that is the end of my clarificatory questions that I had.  I see your counsel wants to say something.   Yes.    Hm.    Oh okay.    The basis.    Okay.    Okay.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay just one.   Ja.    Is that a second question now.  I granted you permission for one.      Yes nothing special.    Okay alright.    Okay.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  I am hoping youare not asking for one more.    Okay.  Thank you very much Mr Zuma for coming to give evidence and share with the commission what you know.  As I said earlier and there may – there will be further discussion between the commission’s legal team and your legal team and in terms of that there may be a need for you to come back.  It just depends on the outcome of the discussions that will take place.  But thank you very much for coming to give evidence.    Chair thank you very much for having me. It is an honour, a privilege and a pleasure to be here.  I appreciate your fairness and thank you for giving me an opportunity to put my side of the story across. Thank you.    No thank you very much and you are now excused.  Thank you.   Yes.    With the other witness the next witness.    Yes.    Okay we are at thirteen minutes past twelve.  If westart at twenty five past twelve will that do?  They say it should be fine.    We will adjourn then and resume at twenty five past twelve.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Good afternoon Ms Gcabashe.    Are you ready?    Okay.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    The file containing the affidavit of Ms Elder Mtshiza is to be marked EXHIBIT HH14.

Okay.    Huh-uh.  Yes.    It is not here?    So just for everyone’s information we are now back in Estina?    Yes.  You say this has not been admitted before?    Yes.  The - well should there not - should there not be something that is written on the spine that indicates that it is a legislation bundle relating to Estina because I think we have got other legislation bundles in other …    Oh.  You - you think just …    HH is enough?    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.  The file - lever arch file containing the Appropriation Bill for the Free State Province will be marked EXHIBIT HH Legislation Bundle C.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    The lever arch file containing court records in regard to Case Number 168/2018 in the Free State High Court between or involving the National Director of Public Prosecutions as Applicant willbe marked EXHIBIT HH Court Records - I thought you said A and B.

Ja.    Okay.    Please just raise your voice again.  I did not hear.    Yes.    Yes.  No that is fine, but let me see.  Oh.  Ja that is - that is - ja.    Is that - is that all?    Oh, okay.    Ja.  No that is fine.    Okay.  No that is fine.    Ja.    I guess that - I guess that it can only mean it is double sworn.    Ja.  Okay, alright.    Maybe before that Ms Gcabashe.  I - I just want to say I did read the affidavit.  I think that most of the things that she deals with are unlikely to be controversial in terms of framework and policies.  There may be somewhere in terms of what actually happened that maybe - maybe - might be disputed. I am not sure but you - you are much closer to the affidavit but I just mention this to say I - I do not mind if you move fast in regard to those areas which are unlikely to be disputed by anybody.  Ja.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    (Intervenes).    Yes, yes.    Ja, ja.    Ja.    So the sworn affidavit comes back.    No.  That is fine.    Are you left with 10 minutes to finish her …    Or not really?  Just to finish the statement and then the annexures?    Yes, yes.  Okay.   Then maybe we should take the adjournment now and then resume at two.  We will try as far as we can to finish both today?    Yes.    Ja, ja.    Yes, yes.    Okay.  No.  That is fine.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at 2 o’ clock.  We adjourn.    Okay, let’s us continue.     Please articulate your response if you’re not – that’s not capture in the record okay.  I think she asked you a question and you nodded, you need to say what your response is.     Ja.     Repeat the question ja.     R53Million?     This presentation that the Province came to make to this panel, as I understand your affidavit that’s a presentation aimed at complying with the requirements…[intervenes].     Yes and your panel would be the one that wouldapprove or would give comment…[intervenes].     Yes and the actual decision to approve would be made by whom?     Yes.     Yes but now you say that, as I understand the position, the team from the Province that made this presentation did not bring along certain documentation?     Was that normal?     Was it normal that people can come for that presentation and leave out what may be important documents because I would imagine that the business plan would be an important document and water rights documents would be important documents?     Well my expectation, and I thought that’s what emerges from your affidavit but you must tell my if my expectation doesn’t accord with the procedures and practices of the – or theprescripts of the Department.  My expectation would be that your committee would not be prepared to approve the grant of so much money without having those important documents being shown to them looking at them and taking a view about them, am I mistaken?     Okay but the long and short of what you are telling me in regard to my question seems to be that it was in order and there was nothing un-procedural or irregular if the – your panel...[intervenes].     Approved the kind of request that it approved in this case without seeing the business plan, without seeing water licenses and without seeing, maybe other documents, is that what you are saying?    Yes and was there a document, whether it’s regulations, policy or whatever that set out what this panel must satisfy itself about and what it should have before it before approving at that time?     Okay, thank you.     Okay.     Okay no that’s fine.     I’m sorry Ms Gcabashe I think you – I missed your announcement to go back to the statement, to the affidavit?     No that’s fine.     That’s fine.     Ja okay.     I’m sorry did you speak through an interpreter or was he quite conversant in English?     You could understand?     Okay.    I am sorry did you say 2041?    Oh okay I think…    That is what might be confusing me because on the page it does not look like it is a letter.   Oh okay now I see.    Ja okay.    Yes.    Just one second.  I am sorry about that.    Thank you.    Okay.    Did you say – did you say paragraph [indistinct].    Oh 30.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Thank you very much for coming to share what you know with the commission.  We appreciate it.  Should there – should a need arise we will ask you to come back but thank you very much and for now you are excused.    Thank you.     Yes okay.    We will – it is about three minutes to three.  We will take – we will resume at ten past.  I will add another seven minutes. We will resume at ten past so we will – I will swear in the wit – the interpreter and then at ten past we rusume.    We adjourn.    Are you ready?    Yes.  Okay.  Proceed please.    The file containing the affidavit of Mr Johannes Cornelis Hermanus Theron will be marked EXHIBIT HH15.    Hm.    Yes.  Well the - the oath will - I guess will be in English.  Let us confirm.  Mr Theron I understand that you are Afrikaans speaking but that you are happy to give evidence in English.  Is that right?   Thank you very much.  So an oath will be administered to you in English now.  Okay.    Thank you.    Yes.    You said when he drafted it.  Was that intentional?    Hm.   Hm.    Oh, yes.   Okay.    Subject to those corrections?    Hm.    Experience.    Hm.    Assessment?    That was your assessment?    Okay.    Just repeat that.  Please just repeat that.    Okay.    It was an opportunity?   Okay.    Did you …?    I am sorry.  Did you drive together with your employer or separately?   Oh.  So you arrived on your own?    Okay.    Did you say you were not informed?    Whose property it was?    You were not informed?   Okay, but you thought it must be …    Estina’s?    Okay.    I think the question is whether you were able to tell what his role was in Estina.  Whether he was a manager of Estina, a director or what it was.    Just a representative?    Okay.    Okay, alright.  So you - you did not understand him to be part of Estina but you understood him to be from outside Estina but appointed as a representative of Estina?    Okay.    So when you say you could tell that he did not have experience that is based on the discussion you had with him?    And the vet, ja, okay.    And is that normal – is that frequency in milking cows quite – every month?    Yes.   It is very hard work, so but it depends as long as the cows have got the milk then you can milk them two or three times a day.    Okay.   So when he invited you to come to this meeting Mr Narayan told you that the purpose was for him to consult you on matters relating to this project, he told you?    Yes, and what – why did he say, did he say why he needed your employer to be there as well?   He didn’t say but he said your employer would come along as well?    But in the discussion that you had with your employer after this the two of you realised that there could be an opportunity to sell your cattle to them?    Yes, now the discussions that happened between you and Mr Narayan at this residence did it involve your employer throughout after he had arrived or was there some discussion before he arrived and he just joined in on the way?    So you did not start the meeting, that is you and Mr Narayan immediately after you had arrived, because you said your employer came about an hour later?    So you did not start discussing you waited for him?    You did not wait?    You did not start?    You talked but the real stuff, not the real business?    Yes.   Okay but basically the meeting was used for Mr Narayan to get advice on various aspects of the project and running a dairy in Vrede?    Yes, okay, alright.    It was raining?    It was raining.  So when you couldn’t use the opportunity successfully with the cows you used it with the equipment?    (laughing) okay.    Sorry, it was a rumour?    Was it a rumour?    Mmm.    Is that something you have personal knowledge of or is that ...[intervenes]     Okay.    Yes.    And was it Mr Motaung who was telling Mr Newman about the pressure.     Yes.    Okay.    Did he say anything about how he would be compensated by the municipality or anybody for losing out on the balance of the period of the lease?    He did not insist on any?    Oh, okay.    Okay, okay.    Thank you.   You said you took – you said this was a stupid project to be done in Vrede, just elaborate on that, tell me why you say that?    So is the reason why you say it was not wise to have this project in Vrede simply that the – it was difficult to produce milk profitably because the price was not ...[intervenes]     The price ratio was not ...[intervenes]     Ja, there was no balance.   Mr Thabethe who was the Head of Department of the Department of Agriculture in the Free State Government at the time, I don’t  know if you ever met him, you know of him?   Ja, he says he testified here and said the only reason why other farmers had moved out of Vrede or had stopped producing milk in that place, in that area, was that there was a problem with the transport, transporting milk, the costs, and he mentioned the price as well, maybe that’s the balance you are talking about that there was no balance between the cost and what you get.    Yes, but he said they thought they thought they would address that problem by the intervention of government because yousee he was saying in effect if you are a farmer you are producing milk and there is this challenge of the transport cost and the price and you are on your own that might be difficult, but if you are going to – if Government is going to come in and assist in one way or another you might be able to continue, what do you say to that?    Just repeat that?    How would they create the market as far as you understand ...[intervenes]     Would hospitals buy this milk or something like that?    That would have solved the problem.    Yes.    Yes.    So that could have dealt with the problem of the imbalance.    Okay, now you say in your statement you have been involved in dairy farming for at least 40 years, is that right?   Yes, these 40 years all within the Free State or in different parts of the country?    In the Free State.    So you are quite knowledgeable.    Yes, but I see also that you do have a BCom degree, is that right?    Which you got from the University of the Free State in 1976?    Yes, it involved, did it have anything to do with farming?    Yes.    Okay, okay.  No thank you very much.  Ms Molefe is there anything?   Nothing.  Thank you very much Mr Theron for coming forward to give evidence.    We appreciate it very much, you are excused.    Thank you.    Yes and we said 16 and 17?    Yes, I previously said that Ms Rockman would give evidence on the 14 t h and 15 t h of October and I said that was provisional.  The final dates are now 16 and 17 October.  Closer to the date I will indicate whether we will start at normal time or at another time and Ms Rockman and her lawyers can be informed at that time, next week.    Okay and then Mr Thabethe?    Yes.    Oh, so should we confirm it now or there is just some discussion?    And then maybe tomorrow.    Or as soon as possible.    Yes, okay, alright, that concludes what we need to deal with today?   Yes, and then I can discuss with you in chambers something relating to Denel.    Otherwise we will adjourn, tomorrow we will start atnormal time.  We adjourn. 
ADV PIET LOUW:  Pleases You.    Thank you Justice.  Mr Zuma may I just remind you; you are still under oath?    Mr Zuma perhaps to commence the issues I wish to deal with – with exactly what the Deputy Chief Justice has been dealing with now namely the press and things have been reported up to nowconcerning you as well.  In the first place – the first point I wish to make is this.  You were asked questions yesterday out of any discernible sequence not that there is anything wrong with it but you did not have the opportunity to actually explain your whole involvement in the meeting how it came about and what happened afterwards and what happened during the course of the meeting in one narrative.  You were asked questions perhaps important questions but in silos and you did not have the opportunity to explain what had actually happened as one narrative.  Now those who are privy to the commission documents would have read your affidavit, the affidavit that you prepared when you applied to cross-examine Mr Jonas.  And there the – the story is told in its – in its extremity.  But just perhaps also because this commission is conducted in – in public scrutiny it is perhaps important for you I would think just at the beginning to give a very quick overview of how it came about that this meeting was organised, what the purpose of the meetingwas, what your role and function was and what happened afterwards?    Sorry can I just say.    Your affidavit of course is at page 37 – sorry 735 which is in Volume LL1.    Yes B.  LL1B.  Perhaps you can just keep that open next to you as you give a very, very quick overview high level overviewand I will ask you questions about that – about the – about the meetings, how it came about?    I – my note says 735 let me just double check.  I think – that is indeed correct.  At page – the second bundle of LL1.      It is LLB    The requirement for the National Director of Public Prosecutions.    I said 1 – 1 [indistinct].    Page 735.    At the left of.  Mr Zuma do you have it?    Right keep that next to you I do not want you to read it out.but if you can just for purposes of commencing your re-examination this morning give a quick overview in a chronological fashion of what happened please.    You resolve it?    And can – just for the record Mr Mokoena just reminded me.  If you say Uncle Fana you mean Hlongwane?    Go ahead.    23 r d October?    Yes.    Saxonold is the suburb that…    That is next to Rosebank.   So – just to stop there for a moment.  Whose idea was it to go to the Hyatt?   Alright and then?    Which phone call.    Just explain that in a bit more detail please?    In Hyde Park?    Could I perhaps just interrupt you here.  Why not your own home we heard it was about 600 meters away from the Gupta residence?    Do you have facilities at home or did you have at that time?    And if you could just expand a bit on the facilities at the Gupta residence.  What – what were they like?  Were there facilities and why would that be a good place to go?   Catering?    Yes.    And could I just ask you this.  Do you any of the –did any of the – if I say do I I mean back in October 2015.    Did any of the Gupta brothers work from home?  Did they conduct any business from home – from that – that specific part of what I think has generally been called the compound?    He is now – he is…    Say that again please?    Rajesh Gupta also knows as Tony.    Yes.   Alright.  So it was a convenient venue to move the discussion to as – and if you can go one then.    What happened?    Did Mr Jonas know where you were going?    Did you mention the name of the owner of the property, the family?    And was he happy with that?    And then what happened?    Did he ask you about your vehicle?    Did he ask you to – in fact go with you or did you offer him to come with you?    Alright and then?    Did he give them any instructions?    And then what happened?    Did you stop anywhere?   So your role has been described differently.  Sometimes as that of a mediator.  Sometimes as that of a spectator.  Sometimes as that …    As merely as somebody who got people together …    And the question was asked and I think legitimately so.  Why need you?  Why were you there at all?    Why …?    Yes.  No, no certainly.   Mr Chair I have no quarrel with that but …    The question - the qualitative question that followed on that was well why were you needed at all.    Why not leave just to the two of them to sort it out over the phone or by some other meeting?    And - and it is - it is (intervenes).   No, no.  I - I thought I made the statement wide enough.    In fact if one reads his own statement.    He uses the term mediator there.    So I am asking now the - the witness really just too …    To clarify your function in that meeting please.    So you had an active role in so far as that is concerned.  If I correctly understand Mr Zuma tell me if I miscategorise what your function was.  You were actually there to explain the fact of the rumour.  Not the - not the truth of it of course ….    But the fact of the rumours of blackmail.  You were there to present evidence so to speak.    Of the fact that there are rumours like that.  Otherwise there would simply be a denial?   Ja.   So you denied …    Mr Jonas denied?    He denied - he - he denied the fact of blackmail but not the fact of the rumour.  Is that correct?    But not the fact that there was a rumour?    Alright and then what happened?    How long was the meeting?    Ja.  Well it is an approximate.    Please give us an idea.  Yes.    And - and then how did it end?    Alright.  So he then left.  Now during the course ofthe meeting your statement stays - affidavit says that Mr Rajesh Gupta made an appearance and there was an interaction with him.  What happened?    Is it possible to say who the - who the - not - I donot think one should call it a patriarch but who is main outside face of the family at that time?    Yes.  The - the person who makes representations …    And decisions and so forth.    And …   Now Mr Ajay Gupta do you - do you have any idea where he was that day?  Was he around or not?    He states under oath that he was at the office.    And Mr Atul Gupta?    Right.  Now Mr Jonas had now left after the meeting with a vehicle that you organised - one of the Gupta vehicles that you organised a driver for him to take him either to the airport or the Gautrain whatever the case might be.  Did you have anything further to do with him?  Did you meet him again - see him again?    Did you see him again?    But you saw him in Cape Town?   Alright.  Now against that background I am going to ask you some pointed questions about issues that came during our learned colleague’s examination of you yesterday.  In the first place the - there are three points I think that have to do with - with the media …    With the media.    The first - can I ask you now to go to the first file of these two.  I think it is File A.  Just call it File A - LL1 …    LL …    LL1A at page 23.  You were asked a number of questions about - about this.  We - you will recall that this is a - a statement that came out by Oakbay and it is dated 13 March 2016.  It is looks a media …    A media statement.    LL1 - LL1A.    Page 23.    Oh yes.  Oh yes.  I - I do recall.    I do recall.   Mr Chair have you seen the statement?    Good.    I think the witness …    You gave him it yesterday.    Excellent.  So now everybody has one.    The - just to get the record straight again on 13 March 2016 Oakbay - oh it would appear - it is Oakbay Investments if you look at the foot of the page.  Statement issued by Oakbay - Oakbay Investments on 13 March 2016.  You were asked whether atthat time you were a director of Oakbay.  Can you recall?    Were you …?    Were you asked about this statement?    Anybody in the Gupta family?    The person who made the statement?    Now it would appear that this statement was in response to an article on the same day that was published in the Sunday Times.  Just too perhaps give you a broad overview and ask you whether you have any knowledge of these dates.  These dates come from the statement of Mr Jonas and they would seem to be quite correct. Namely that there was a Financial Times London report on 8 March 2016.  Did you see that report?  Do you know anything about it?  And then there was a News24 report onMarch 2016.  Did you see that?    Can you recall it?   We are going to go to that in a moment and then there as the Sunday Times report of 13 March 2016 and then came the Oakbay statement.    Now we have been able to find a - the - the statement that was public - the may - not statement.  I apologise.  The report that was made in the Sunday Times.  An article that was written about this on 13 March 2016.  Mr Chairman I wonder could I perhaps ask to hand this to you.  It - it provides a lot of context and …   And there is one for the witness as well.    I thought …    I put at the right top in pencil LL123A because it sits snuggling …    Behind the (intervenes).    Fine.    Ja, but …    We have got an LL2.    If I am not mistaken.  We have got LL1 which consist of two bundles.    A and B.   And then LL2.    Which is the small bundle the C Bundle.    So this will be LL3.    Eight?    Oh.  I see.  So the numbers have gone on.  So it must be LL8.  LL8.    It is one article.    You can see at the foot on the first page Times Live Sunday Times.  The date is given 13 March 2016 and the article is headed “How Guptas Shopped for New Minister”.    Chair with - with your leave not 18 March but 13 March.    1-3.    I thought I heard 18.  I apologise.    Oh, good.    Mr Zuma …    Do you see that?  I - I just want to take you to a few points in this document.  Now before I do so could I just remind you questions that were put to you yesterday about the Oakbay statement of 13 March and the - the main issue was in the middle of the page it was pointed out to you that there was a statement to the following - in    You - you recall that?    And the question quite fairly was put to you.  Well what about your meeting?  There was a meeting.  Was there not?    Now the question of course is one of context.  The meeting that was dealt with in - in this statement that was issued by Oakbay obviously dealt with the meeting that was reported about in the Sunday Times article.  That I am going to take you to now in a momentwhich on your version is a fiction.  It never happened.    Yes.    Alright.  So if I can quickly take you to the report or the article that was published in the Sunday Times.  It starts off with    So that was 2015.    Of course.  Apologise. “The - the London based Financial Times reported this week that the Guptas close friends - friends of Zuma met Jonas just before Nene was fired to tell him they wanted him to be the next political head of the National Treasury.  The Guptas said through anattorney yesterday there have been an extraordinary number of allegations around the Gupta family in recent weeks.  Several of which have involved the finance - Finance Ministry.  As we have said countless times our primary focus is on business not politics.  To be absolutely clear there was no meeting at all.  Let alone any inferences or cash offers …” You see that?    It then goes on. “…but the Sunday Times has established that the    So that “he” cannot be a reference to you.  It must be somebody else?    And then it goes on. “Of course they do this to prove those things - sorry - those they call that “whether you like it or not we are in charge””. And there is a - it seems to me a - something missing in the text but it goes on.“In the meeting Jonas was told that the job was his if he wanted it but could come with conditions - but would come with conditions.  He would have to push for the approval of the nuclear procurement program and clear certain men from the top echelons of the Treasury.” And it goes on. “He was given a list of people to get rid of including Director-Generals, General Lungisa, Ismail Momoniat, Andrew Donaldson andKenneth Brown.  The four who have been with the Treasury for more than 22 years are among the fiercest critics of the nuclear procurement program which they believe would bankrupt South Africa.” And then it goes on in a similar vein.  Across the page. “It cannot be that we have a state that is run by a family or a grouping of people apart from its selected representatives.” I think that is actually a quotation mark that is written out. “…and then firing them sources said would have allowed the family to capture the Treasury as full vacancies would have been filled by bureaucrats approved by the Guptas.” Then it goes on about the nuclear program Shiva Uranium    Or any other communication of any sort?    It goes across the page.“It is quite clear that the Guptas influence cannot be understated.  That is what we need to stop.  Mantashe denied receiving a call from Jonas and referred the Sunday Times to the Deputy Minister and then in an enigmatic - in an enigmatic way he said phone Mcebisi and ask him because he is alive.  He is not an ancestor.  He is capable of speaking for himself.” And then importantly the next paragraph reads as follows.  Please listen carefully. “Nene told …”    Mcebisi.  I apologise Chair.    No, no.  Certainly, yes.    I am - I am going to receive lessons afterwards about clicks.  Then the next paragraphs is of importance Mr Zuma. “Nene told the Sunday Times that he knew nothing about the meeting and did not recall any conversation with Jonas about the meeting with the Gupta family.” See that?    That of course from other sources appears to be contradicted at this point.    It then goes on. “After Jonas turned down the offers to replace Nene David Van Rooyen was appointed Finance Minister.  The markets reacted with shock.” And it then goes into the whole Nenegate thing and the replacement with Mr Gordhan and it really then goes on about other political fallout issues from - from this report.  Now was this - I take it - this was the report to which the Oakbay statement responded?    The times …    Workout in that sequence.    Alright.  Then importantly still on this topic of - of statements and so forth.  If I could ask you just about something that you testified about the Public Protector yesterday and you expressed some concern with the way that the Public Protector dealt with the investigation and your role and function in that whole investigation. Perhaps you can just explain to the Chair what had happened and what was it that made you concern - raised your concerns concerning the - the Public Protector’s investigation.   Sorry.  Can I just ask you?  Perhaps just point at questions.  Were you invited to the Public Protector?    Subpoena.     Did you – the Public Protector make available, to you the versions of other persons such as Mr Jonas perhaps?     For you to respond to it?    Good now if I could perhaps then ask you one or tworather small questions about questions that were put to you yesterday to conclude?  The first one concerns an invitation by the Chair to you to speculate about what the reasons would have been why Mr Jonas raised the human cry after the meeting with Messrs. Nene and Gordhan.  I’m not going to ask you about the contents of those discussions that’s before the Commission and we’ll deal with that in due course but I’m going to ask you is this, not to speculate.  What actually happened to you as a consequence of Mr Jonas’ statements, taking into account the fact that he did not lay a charge against you for reasons that he gave to the Commission earlier, what happened to you, what were the consequences of his statements?     Of course.    Can I just ask you there, just be a bit more specific, you were arrested, is that correct?     And what were you arrested for?     And what did that stem from, what was the complaint?     The Jonas matter?     The Jonas meeting?     And I think, if I may just perhaps assist you, the charges would have been framed under the prevention and combatingof corrupt activities of 2004?     Also known as PRECA?     As well as perhaps POCA, the Prevention of Organised Crime Act of 1998.  Now how did the arrest take place, where were you arrested and what happened?     So you were just coming back to South Africa for some other purpose?     Was there any press present when you were arrested?    But it was based on Mr Jonas’ reports about what happened at the meeting?     Only on that? MR DUDUZANE     And Mr Jonas refused to make a statement?     And then what happened with these charges?    Sorry I think you were arrested in July last year?        Do you feel aggrieved by the arrest?     Are you going to take any legal steps about it?     Have you – do you know – I suppose you do know that your lawyers have addressed a letter of demand to the police?     For wrongful arrest.     Alright.     Look I think there were complainants but they were not Mr Jonas?     And Mr Jonas would not provide a statement?     Alright then…[intervenes].    Ja you were still at the third point or second point you’re going to the third point.     Alright the second last point I wish to deal with is, a point that our learned colleague made yesterday, over and over again which was that there is a discrepancy between the version that you told the Chair about the meeting, namely that Mr Rajesh Gupta came in and what Mr Hlongwane said in his interview with the Public Protector saying that it was not one of the three Gupta brothers it might have been another one, he doesn’t know but it perhaps not Mr Rajesh, do you recall that?     And it was put to you on the basis, I would thinkthat this discrepancy is destructive of your version.     And the truth of your version. Now could I ask you not to speculate about what Mr Hlongwane might have thought on this point but perhaps just to turn to page – in the second bundle of LL1A – sorry this is now at B – LL1B, page 742.     742.     Yes you perhaps have seen this before but he makes the point that he was there at the property that indeed he did peek in to the meeting, take you out and had a quick discussion with you about administrative things and then left.     And this in on oath, is that correct?     Good Mr Zuma I think in conclusion, may I ask you whether there’s anything that you would want to add to your evidence, you have refreshed your memory about the statement that you made that you made to the Chair, you made the point yesterday that your statement is perhaps not as comprehensive as otherwise it could have been, it didn’t deal with all of the phone calls and SMS’s and WhatsApp’s perhaps leading up to the meeting with Mr Jonas and perhaps afterwards.  You’ve seen what Mr Jonas said about that, youagree that there were communications between you, is there anything else perhaps, detail that you would want to focus on in conclusion, you will not have the chance again?     Mr Zuma if there are any further queries by the Commission would you assist?     Chair those are the questions, thank you.    Thank you Mr Chair the – there are two points that our learned colleague made.  He wants to ask a few questions about the Public Protector we have no quarrel with that of course.  The reason why we dealt with the Public Protector is because of reports that have apparently been published overnight in some of the press about what Mr Zuma said yesterday in these – in these proceedings.  So it was really to give him an opportunity to deal with that and just to perhaps clarify issues from his perspective.    It was not – it was not to deal with a new front and opening a new front.    The second point is the issue of it was dealt – it wastermed I think yesterday an omission or an oversight or a gap or something like that.    Mr Chair with – with respect after some reflection.    We decided not to ask questions about it.  It really concerns Ms Mentoor.    And what she testified about…    And what had happened but we can deal with all of those.    Aspects.    At the end of the day should you invite us to present argument.    Which we take – take it that you will.    Taking into account Mr Chair that.    Insofar as this part of item 1.1.    Of the schedule to the proclamation is concerned.   You have to make a factual finding.    And we would like of course in due course to present an argument to you.    On that factual finding.    Submissions yes.    So – so we have no quarrel with questions about the Public Protector.    I told you why we went there this morning and then insofar as the other aspect is concerned once again.    It is not really a matter for Mr Zuma to deal with.    It is more a matter of argument.    Thank you.    Ja.    Not speaking into microphone.   In facilities.  It was not a shebeen.  It was catering facilities.    Mr Chair yes.    I just something from our side not from the witness.    Mr Joubert who sits next to me – apologise – was the counsel who represented Mr Zuma at the time of his arrest and merely to – from the bar just to inform you that Mr Zuma was never asked for a statement, he did not ever make a warning statement.  There was no attempt to illicit further information or evidence from Mr Zuma.  He was merely arrested under the Act that I read out earlier ThePrevention on – And Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act of 2004 and the Prevention Of Organisation Crime Act of 1998.  They go by the acronyms of PRECA and POCA.  The charge insofar – no charge was ever put but the reason for the arrest is that Mr Zuma was apparently present when a bribe was offered to Mr Jonas and he did not make a report about that.  It is a report [indistinct].    So that is – it is    It is this inaction.    That I understand.    Was what the police were after.  The supreme irony of course being that Mr Jonas himself did not make such a report anduntil today has refused to cooperate with the police on that point.  That merely insofar as that issue is concerned.      With your leave may I ask the witness one final question?  It is – it is something that concerns you Mr Chairman.    And it would have concerned me as well.    And perhaps I can just ask the witness a question.    Just one.    Mr Zuma the Gupta residence. Can I ask you this?  Is it the same as any other ordinary residence?  Would you be able to go five houses down the line in the same street in Saxonwold and walk in and have a meeting?  Or is there anything special?  Is the house, the residence, the area where you – where you met with Mr Hlongwane and Mr Jonas different from ordinary houses or is it just another sitting room, lounge area that of which there are probably millions in Johannesburg?    Were there any …    Thank you Mr Chair. 
MR DUDUZANE ZUMA:  Good morning Chair.    Thank you.    Okay thank you.  I will try and be quick Chair.  As I had said…    Okay.    B.    Yes what page is that again Sir?    This is LL1B.   735 okay.  Okay.    I have got it Sir.    Okay.  So I had said there were rumours making the rounds on a certain issue which has been termed as blackmailing between Uncle Fana and Mr Jonas.  These were rumours that were persisting for a few months and by the time I had spoken to Uncle Fana this was at a point where I was like okay we need to – we need to – to see what is going on here because on the one hand when I had spoken to Uncle Fana he was not too sure about the rumours and he just said, look let us leave it.  I popped it up again he said the same thing and at the third I have asked him he said okay if you are very sure about this and serious about this you resolve it.  So he gave me…    Yes.  Resolving meaning set up a meeting, get the three of us to sit down and we will discuss this matter.    It is Mr Hlongwane yes sorry about that.  Cool.  Ja can I just –     Thank you.  So if I am not mistaken that would have been the period leading up to October 23 r d meeting.  I was given the number obviously by Uncle Fana because I did not have Mr Jonas’ number.  As I had said I never met him before.  I did not see anything untoward.  It is normal course.  If there is any issue, if there is anydiscussion to be had you speak to people.  I did not see – they agreed to meet or not.  So I got his number and contact was initiated.  Initially it was via sms and then one or two phone calls but there was a busy period in between and I think it took quite a few weeks for us to sit around the table.  So by the time we decided to meet up it was on the 23 r d Mr Jonas was at Nedlac which is in Rosebank.    Yes.    So this is the day in question.  So the Nedlac offices are in Rosebank.  I am not too far from Rosebank.  I live in Saxonwold as is known and…    Next to Rosebank.  It is adjacent to Rosebank.  So I had received a message from Mr Jonas saying look I will be leaving out of town later this afternoon/evening.  There is an opportunity to meet because Nedlac seemed like it is finishing off early today.  And that is when he had sent the times and if I am not mistaken he moved it again a bit earlier.  I actually arrived to the meeting slightly late because the time was moved a bit.  As I got to the venue which was the Hyatt Regency in Rosebank.    It was Mr Jonas’ idea.    When I got to the Hyatt he was – he was there already sitting in the reception – reception area.  The lobby should I say.  And greeted him.  Exchanged very short pleasantries and obviously we were waiting for Uncle Fana to arrive.  And in that inter-leading period that is when the phone call came in and said…    The phone call that was a venue change phone call.    Okay.  So the phone call came in on my mobile device from Uncle Fana to say look I am not comfortable meeting in a public area.  Mr Jonas also looked uncomfortable as was I because it is a hotel lobby and people are sitting around there.  Everyone has gottheir own profile or whatever it is.  So the phone call came in.  They had the discussion between the two of them and I said look whatever you guys decide we will go.  So the venue – the decision for the venue was a very difficult one because we could not go to Uncle Fana’s house because he stays in another suburb in that area.    Yes.  He was on his way to the meeting.  He wanted the meeting changed to somewhere more private and that is when I had suggested down the road there is a place that I do work from which happens to be the household.  And the reason why I do workfrom there is because there are also some office facilities so I had been conducting my meetings outside of the office for a very long time.  From the Gupta residence as it is called.     I do not conduct meetings from my personal home.    I have got an office but that is purely for own private matters.    Ja so when I say facilities it is just obviously printing capacity staff in between I mean there is – what is it – catering sort of.    Catering yes.    Food, water, coffee whatever it is – snacks and it just makes it easier as opposed to sitting in a coffee shop.  It is a private area so that is what I mean by office facilities.    Sure.    Yes.  As I said the person that I worked very closely with was a Mr Tony Gupta that is the person that I was in business with and we conducted…    Rajesh.    Mr Rajesh – Rajesh Gupta.    Also known as Tony.    As I had said we – we spend a lot of time together.  We conducted business on a daily basis wherever it was.  Whether it was – we went – we would go to the office at times and as I said yesterday I limited my movements to the office and we conducted a lot of our business from the household.  As for the other two brothers they spent a lot of time at the offices and obviously there is varying officers in Midrand and in Sandton.    Yes.   So after the phone call after there was mutual agreement between the three parties – I am obviously the one that came up with the venue that is when we decided to make a move.    Yes that is correct Sir.    Yes I did.    He was – like I said the whole time from when I had met him, during the meeting, post the meeting there was no apprehension from his side.  There was no hostility.  So the way I took it is he was fine to do so.  And if he was not he would have said so I am sure.   From that point logistically he decided to come with me because he said you have your own vehicle.  I said yes, jump in with you. I said no.    Yes.    I had said I have got my vehicle and if we can go it just made logistics easier you do not have to follow.  We do nothave to follow each other and he said if you do have a vehicle I will jump in the car with you.    So he had his security/entourage which he had to leave behind obviously.     I am not sure what their discussion was but they did not come along no.    And well obviously well the reason he done that obviously was because we were going somewhere private otherwise he would have followed us with his – with his team.  And I appreciated that.  So we jumped into my vehicle and we made our way to the residence.    We stopped at - there is an Engen Garage which is just around the corner from the Hyatt because I was low on - on petrol.  So that took a bit of time and from there we continued to - to the residence and that is when we had arrived almost simultaneously with Uncle Fana.  Walked into the residence, went to the lounge.  We sat in the lounge and that is when we started the discussions. Obviously pleasantries were exchanged.  These are two gentlemen that have known each other for a very long time as they have both confirmed.  They shared a few war stories from their MK days and that is when I introduced the meeting and the reason we therefor the meeting.    Of a policeman.    True.    Mediator.    Yes.  So my - my function in the meeting wasbesides pulling the two parties together because that is - that is what resolving issues is about.  Get the people around the table.  That was my one function and the second one as per agreement that meeting could never have happened between the two of them without the person that is - had introduced this issue of the background rumours and that sort of thing. So if you are raising that you need to be part of that meeting.  You need to own that - that rumourmongering idea and you need to present it yourself because when I am asked and I am alone in that meeting it is - it is a very difficult thing to do because he is -Uncle Fana would be asked but who is saying this.  He might mention my name.   He might not mention my name.  So the idea was that I be in the meeting.  I own the issue of the meeting and I - I present it and that is exactly what happened.    Yes.    Ja.    Correct.  I was - if I may say I was - I was acting as a witness as well in that meeting because you know I was going to be tested which I was to say okay you are raising this.  Where did you hear it?  Why did you hear it?  Who was saying it?  Whatever, whatever that the questions would have been at that time and - and why are you pulling us together? Why did you not just raise it with Uncle Fana?  You raise it with me.  All those - all those questions would have obviously been canvassed in - in that meeting …    And they were and I said look I am over here.  I cannot just say something.  I have had the discussion with Uncle Fana.  I cannot not own this issue and that is exactly why I was there to say I am presenting it to you and I - I was at the risk of a denial and that is exactly what happened.    Ja of course.    Yes he did.    He denied the fact of blackmail, yes.    Yes.  No, no.  I am not sure if he was aware of it or not.  I do not know but this is what I heard.   So the meeting continued.  It took the shape it did.    Say approximately 40/45 minutes.  I mean I will need - I will need to - to check the time.    Well let us - let us call it …    Let us call it, ja.  45 minutes.   It ended in a stalemate obviously.  There was this allegation that was put to him that he denied.  There was a back and forth between the two of them that ended up the way it did but by the time the meeting was done.  It was agreed that look this matter will - will pick up on - on another occasion because there was obviously time constraints from - from Mr Jonas who was travelling to wherever he was travelling. Then at that point I had walked Mr Jonas out to - to the arrival area - the parking lot and I had asked him where he was going to and he said look he is not sure.  He is either going to go to the Gautrain in Rosebank or to - to the airport - to the airport and I said look here is a driver.  He will take you wherever you need to go and that was - that was the end of that of - of that eventful day.    So it was an interaction to the meeting which was purely to get my attention for confirmation for a meeting which was going to be over the next day or a few days.  So he peered into the room, got my attention and I had walked out of the room whilst the conversation continued and then I popped back in and that was for a short period.  It was not a long period.    Okay.  Mr Ajay obviously will be the eldest brother.  Mr Atul is the middle brother.  Age wise I am not too sure.  Let me approximate it as well.  Let us put Mr Ajay at late 50s and Mr Atul in his mid-50s.    Sorry.    Mr Ajay in his late 50s.  Mr Atul in his mid-50s and Mr Tony in his late 40s.    By outside face you …    Representations.    No that is - that is - in my view it would Mr Atul which is the middle brother because he was the Chairman of the group.    And sorry - and then on - on that day if I - because when we have meetings at the house there is generally nobody else.  Nobody else meaning the brothers would also go - the other brothers - two brothers would be either travelling or at the office because they were quite strictly office bound.  So for them not to be there is not an anomaly here.    I am not sure where he would have been that day.  I read his testimony but from my recollection at that time I did not see him in the household at any point.    Then it is probably where he was sir.    Once again he was not at the house at thatparticular point in time and I have read the - the documents in front of me and as the documents state he was in the country at that time.  So he was travelling.    So before he left the house after the meeting we had agreed that we would have a follow up in the following week -the Monday or Tuesday or so and that never happened.  There was one or two SMS exchanges and then it just quietened down and that is the last bit of communication that we had had post the meeting.    Yes.  I - I did see him again.  Like I said I think twice.  Once was at the same Hyatt Hotel.  He was standing outside waiting for whoever or whatever on his phone and I had seen him.  Like hey Mr Jonas how are you sir and this was post obviously now the - the news stories had broken.  He had put out a statement.  He made these allegations and I went to greet him to check how he was doing. He looked okay.  Gave him a big handshake and a hug and kept moving and then the next time I had seen him after that was I may be mistaken.  It was either the State of the Nation Address or opening of parliament.  One of the two.  I do not know.    Yes.  In Cape Town.  It was after the event when everyone was walking out of the venue and we actually ended up bumping into each other.  We were walking down the stairs together and that is when I greeted him and he greeted back and we continued on our paths sir.    Sorry.  With the?   Okay.    No.    No.  This is (intervenes).    That is the one Chair.    I will have to check.  I cannot recall but …    Chances are I was sir.    Asked by who sir?    No, no.    No.  I was not asked.   I - I know about it.  I did not - I did not follow up on it at that time, no.    I …    I think I did - I did - I did see that one.    Yes.  I - I did see that one.    Yes.  I see.    I recall that sir.    Yes sir.    With the inclusion of the brothers?    Ja.  That did not happen.    2015.    That is correct.    Yes.  I see that.    Well most definitely not.    That is somebody else, yes.    No.  There was not.    Nope.  There was not.    Yes.  I see that.   Yes sir.    I am not - I am not sure but it - it seems like that.    (Intervenes).   Yes.    Okay.  I think the reason we all sitting here today at the State Capture Commission is based on the findings of the Public Protector Report.  The various role players that have had to come and testify.  I mean that is not what I am getting into but some of us have been integral to those investigations.  We have sat here alleged of all sorts of wrongdoing, corruption, bribery. You know it has been going on almost on a daily basis from about three years ago.  So what I would have expected was a - a fair opportunity to represent or reflect on my side of the story like I am doing here yesterday and today.  I did not get that opportunity.  Was communication sent to me?  Yes.  It was.    This was towards the tail end.  From a time frame perspective towards the tail end.  Time wise I - I - but before thetail end meaning before the report was finalised.  I was travelling at the time.  I had received a phone call.  I forget the - the lady’s name that called and she said she is from the Public Protector’s Office and she was checking if I had received communication and I said I will check my - my emails and she telephonically said no check it. We are inviting you just to come and sit and have a discussion and interview and just to get to your side of the story and the - and the version of events and I said cool.  I will check that.  Checked the email and indeed there was an email.  Following up and this was a very short period after the phone call and the email.  Ireceived a summons or …    A subpoena of some sort to appear urgently and the discussion that I had had with the - the representative from the Public Protector’s Offices - I am not in the country currently.  I am conducting business.  I am not living in South Africa any longer at that time.  So I will need time and when I get back I will look you up and I will come and - and present myself. So that was the - the version - the sequence of events and before I could even make those decisions there was a - a finalised report that had come out.  Now the reason I had raised it yesterday is obviously I am sitting here today.  I have been mentioned in all sorts of lights.  I - I did not have an opportunity to - to give my - my version of events and the basis of that report is what this whole State Capture Commission is about.I am sitting here having to answer all sorts of allegations that could have been answered that that point.     No I...[intervenes].     I did not receive any notices, I didn’t receive any transcripts that was – everything I’ve seen has been post the finalising of the report.     There have been quite a few consequences I’ll get into them but before I get to that and answer your question, I’d just like to make a point if I may?     I mean I’m not sure if I’ll have an opportunity to speak ever again so once I leave this chair I just want to satisfy that.     Thank you, I think there are three levels to this whole scenario that need to be satisfied, the first one being it’s the deal in being political, legal and perception.  Now on the perception front that is purely on the Court of public opinion which is driven by a narrative that stems from media reports and allegations from wherever they come from.  Now I’m look at as a criminal, I’m looked at as this face of corruption, this guy that’s plundered trillions out of this countrywhich is not the case by the way.  So I would just like to say to the public out there, I’m not corrupt, I’m not taking any money from anybody, I never have and I never will.  How they take it, that’s for me to decide.  So I just want to make that clear so if you see me walking around you know, just know that it’s not me.  Secondly there’s the legal perspective which is obviously one of the reasons I’m sitting here today.  There have been a lot of legal repercussions stemming out of all sorts of investigations or lack of investigations.  I’ve had to walk in and out of court rooms, I’ve had to face charges that…[intervenes].     Yes that’s correct.     This was at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court and that was a charge of corruption.    No the complaint is the specific matter we’re dealing with right now.     The Jonas matter yes.     Yes.     Yes that’s correct.     Yes that is correct.     Obviously there was a lot of speculation in the media and by the time I’d – you know I was labelled the fugitive so I was living out of the country I was in self – so-called self exile which I was not the reasons why I was not living here which I’ll get into.  When I landed at OR Tambo I was escorted to…[intervenes].     Ja I was coming for my little brother’s funerallast year, that’s the reason I was coming back.  So on my arrival there was obviously some sort of notice that I had to face the consequences of my actions and that when I asked the gentleman at the immigration he told me it was a notice that was originating from the Rosebank Police Station.  So that complaint was put forward by the Democratic Alliance, that was at the airport, fortunately my legal team managed to arrive on time and resolve that issue and we dealt with the matter on the Monday because I arrived, I think, on the Thursday evening.     No not at the airport no. On the Monday, that’s when we went through the whole rigmarole of going to the police station and then the court room and, you know, that’s public knowledge.  So that is the way that the arrest happened and at all material times I had my legal representative with me and we just wanted to see the documentation which was not forthcoming by the Law Enforcement Officers, we wanted to see the charge sheets, we wanted to see the warrants, if there were any and we were not furnished with those.  So it was a very peculiar situation but you know, it turned out the way it turned out.     Yes that’s eventually what that…[intervenes].     Yes that’s also what we found out via his testimony here.     They persisted for – so when we appeared in the…[intervenes].     Yes it was around that time, so after we appeared at the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court they postponedit for, I think it was a period of six months or so for further investigations and by the time we’d gone back to appear that’s when the charges were provisionally withdrawn and that was on the basis that they are waiting for the outcome of the Commission.     Ja of course I do.     Most definitely, most definitely.     Yes that’s exactly…[intervenes].     Correct Sir.     If I may make a point the reason for that is asyou found out on the charge sheet there has not been a complainant so you know, my limited knowledge of how things work is, if there is no complainant, there’s no charges.  So you know, someone has to explain exactly what’s going on…[intervenes].     No.     That’s the point I’m trying to make.     Sorry if I may continue, I wasn’t done…[intervenes].     Yes the second point was a legal which we’ve covered a bit of and I’ll leave that so I won’t belabour that point and then the first is obviously the political and I think we’d all be fooling ourselves to think that there hasn’t been a political play in the background, you know, speculation is one thing but I think if you look back in hindsight the history speaks for itself.  If you look at how a lot of issues have come to the fore the people that have brought the issues to the fore, what has happened to people on either side of the political wranglings, I think that is an obvious case, and I’ve said it before and I’m saying it again, I believe I’m unfortunately caught in a political storm.    Yes I recall that.     Yes.    That would be Mr Rajesh’s statement?      Yes.    Yes sir.     I think a lot of the points we’ve covered and as Mr Mokoena said and there’s a lot of common cause issues that are [indistinct] because we agree on the versions.  At this point I think I’ve said – I’ve said what I can say, my statement obviously is not as comprehensive as it should be but I think that’s the points that I wanted to cover.  A lot of what has been said I don’t know the detail of I have not checked people’s cell phone records, SMS’s, phone calls and whatever else may have been left out of my affidavit.      I’m here to comply, I’ve complied the whole way through, even though it’s been made to look like I’ve been evasiveand running away I’ve been here three times before, this is my fourth time so I have no issues with complying with the Commission. I hope I don’t have to see Mr Zondo ever again but if I have to, I’ve complied and I will comply.     Thank you very much.    At some…    At some point yes I did.    Yes I was out of the country.   After…    After a phone call yes I received the subpoena.    Yes and I communicated it quite clearly that I am travelling when I get back I will come and present myself.    That is correct Sir.    Yes.  Before you ask Chair can I just clarifyone thing?    Just from the line of questioning about [indistinct].    I just want to make it clear the procedural part of how the Public Protector dealt with it it is – it is up for debate.  All I am saying is my version is not on the final report and I take your point, look for another avenue.  You said that I should have maybe taken an approach like Mr Ajay Gupta did to force himself to go and presenthimself.  Once again I humbly disagree with that because if people are looking for aversions and aversions of events you know that is something that we need to present.  They need to give us that opportunity.  We cannot be fighting for that opportunity especially when it is something that affects us via allegations.  So I am just merely putting across that I am sitting here today and that is what I said yesterday why is my version not on – of events not on the Public Protector’s Report?  That is all I am saying.    Thank you.    Good.    Thank you Chair.    I will do so Chair.    Thank you.  What I was referring to was immediate facilities for any catering requirements for guests or people that we meeting with.  That would be tea, coffee, snacks, biscuits, nuts, whatever – whatever people have so that is what I was referring to.    Hot drinks as in…   Temperature not – not alcohol.    Yes, Yes I will do.    Chair when I said the catering parts and the drinks and sort of thing I think I did not say it in isolation I mentioned office facilities as well and staff.  So it is whole…    Yes.    Which is – yes – which is something that I may or may not have at my place which might inform my decisions not tohave meetings there.    I was asked if I have an office there, yes I have my own personal office.    But do I have facilities that would be office type, printers, staff, runners, whatever it is, no I do not.  So to answer your question of course I have entertained very few friends not many.  I do not have a huge staff compliment.  I do not have typical office type equipment in my home and that is what would have made me not haveany meetings of that sort.  Now to answer your question.  On Uncle Fana being a friend Mr Jonas being the friend’s friend I think I have stated quite clearly that I do not conduct business meetings from or meetings of that nature from my residence.    Yes.    Yes.  The two friends.  They were friendly to each other.  I only had one friend so the other technically is not – and was not my friend.    So he remains – he remains a let us call it a stranger well especially at that point.    So from – from a welcoming perspective from having someone in my home that I do not know is something that I do not generally do and I did not do on that day.   Yes.    I understand that.  I understand where you coming from Chair.    No though I mentioned the offices…    No, no because that is what my daily business.    My daily movements were like so   The point I was trying to make with the office facilities because I was asked.     A direct question, why did I not go to my office to have the meeting.    What put me – what put me at a residence at that point and I had mentioned.    Those facilities so to highlight why I could have meetings of that nature work related.    In that space.    Thank you Chair.    That is the position Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    There was no further information but it was still interrogated.    Yes.    At that point from what I had known he did not know and wanted to find out.    Yes.    Like I said the meeting ended off after the denial it took its turn and by the time the meeting was done there was a conversation to reconvene earlier in the week.    To pick up discussions that was the end of it.  So whether it was not.    I cannot comment on that Sir.    Chair no it solely related to that specific meeting and as my counsel pointed out that it had to do with the poker and the pucker issues.  So around the so called bribe.    Yes.    At what point would have that been?    Like I had said the whole period leading up to – to today there had not been much communication that has been passed [indistinct].    We made numerous requests and still continue to make numerous requests to…    The law enforcement agencies.    To the NPA guys.  What is the story?  What is the situation?      If there is anything please let us know.    We will comply.  We will give you whateverinformation you need.  If there is anything you investigating because there is a lot of stuff being thrown around and in the public domain.    We are here.  We understand that is what is being said is there anything you need from us.  So even up until that point there was no questioning there was no interaction of any sort.  As a matter of fact we were asking them prior to the arrest.    What is the issue can we assist?  During the arrest what is the charge?  We were not given that information.   Only after the arrest we managed to get sight of – because obviously they needed to present charge sheets and warrants and that sort of thing and that is why now I have decided to take the steps that I have decided to take because I really want to understand what the issues are.  Because I have not had that opportunity to have that conversation.  I did not have the opportunity to be questioned.  It was just an event that just took me in the direction they wanted to take me and it ended up the way it did.    If there are probably millions in Johannesburg that should make it the million and first one so it is just like any other residence.    Normal lounge –   Just to clarify Chair.  It is like any other – any other residence there is no …    Nothing special because this – just…    Ja there is a lounge a normal lounge. 
DV PIET LOUW:  You explained your relationship with the - the - Tony -Mr Tony Gupta - Rajesh - yesterday.

ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair you would recall that yesterday I stayed away posing any questions relating to the Public Protector because I thought that that proceedings had their own life and sway and they were dealt with decisively.  But I see that they also emerged in re-examination and I thought that maybe there must be two or three clarity questions from our side to Mr Zuma simply you know to place the matter in its proper context.  And if I am permitted I will limit myself toonly those three or four questions of the PP because I think it is quite important.    Yes.    It would appear that it was never persisted with because Mr Louw did not persist with it today Chair and I take it that it was since resolved either between Mr Zuma and his legal team because no one have raised it for today.  So it might be that it isno – it is no longer an issue.    But ought you know to receive your attention    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Zuma I am sure that the Public Protector’s you know reports which are not here well speak forthemselves.  We did not bring them along and I am simply asking these questions in order to clarify certain aspects you know arising from your re-examination.  Do I understand you correctly that you did as a matter of fact receive an invitation from the Public Protector?    To participate in the proceedings.    Yes.  And you then went overseas, am I correct?    Yes.  You received then a subpoena?    Which  - yes.    Yes.  And you were not able to honour the subpoena because you were overseas?    Yes.  So you were not ignored.  At least there was the invitation and there was subpoena?    Yes.   Thanks Chair.    No questions.  No questions at all Chair.    Mr Chair.    My colleagues are here ready and eager to proceed with the next business.    But we – if we may afford them maybe ten or fifteen minutes adjournment for them to be able to …    Properly you know place themselves.    That is fine.  Should be fine Chair.

ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good afternoon Chairman.    Yes.  I am Chairman.    Chair …    Chairman this witness - the evidence of this witness is largely of a - a technically nature.   She will be explaining how conditional grants that were administered from her office were intended to - to be used in particular in - within the context of the Vrede Dairy Farm Project.  Her affidavit Chairman is contained in EXHIBIT HH14.  Might this exhibit be admitted into the record of evidence Chairman?    Thank you Chairman.  In addition Chairman there are one or two other documents we would like to askthe Chairman to admit into the record of evidence.  The first is the EXHIBIT Reference Bundle E.  So we have reference bundles Chairman from A to F.  At the last hearing or the last but one hearing we were not sure whether reference Bundle E had in fact been admitted into evidence. We will not be using it today but it is really just the technical procedure of ensuring that you have formally admitted EXHIBIT HH Reference Bundle E into evidence Chairman.    Thank you Chairman.    Then there is a legislation bundleChairman.  So it is EXHIBIT HH Legislation Bundle C.  That too we ask you to admit into - to evidence Chairman.    Hm.    After that there will be one more Chairman.    We are back in Estina Chair.   It has not Chairman.    We - we can do that Chair.    We thought the …    HH description …    Would suffice …    Because we have a legislation bundle A …   And B.  We …    We simply add it to it and created a C.    Thank you Chairman.    The last one Chairman relates to courtrecords.  You had requested that we try and give you just as a reference bundle …    Court records that have preceded …    The establishment of this Commission.    There are two that we have added to the court record bundle Chairman.    So it will be EXHIBIT HH Court Records C and D that we ask to be admitted into the record of evidence.    It is - it is meant to be C Chairman and D Chairman.    Thank you Chair.  We are indebted to you for admitting these at this point in time.    Chairman I think the witness is ready to be sworn in.    Thank you Chairman.  Ms Mtshiza I would like you just to raise your voice a little.  Maybe pull the mic a little closer as well so that you are audible.  Thank you.  You will find to your left a number of files and documents and the - the little one on your table which is marked EXHIBIT HH14 are relevant for today’s proceedings. In fact if I can qualify that statement.  So HH14 which hasyour statement is relevant for today’s proceedings and I believe we will only need Reference Bundles B - small b and F.  They may already have put them on your table for you ma’am.  Have a look at the two files that are on your table.  We need Reference Bundle b and F for today’s purposes with - if all goes well we should not have to refer to any of the others.  Thank you very much. If you then go to your affidavit which are contained in EXHIBIT HH14 and turn to page 1 thereof.  I know we have discussed the small amendment you would like to make to what is written in the tramlines at the top.  Could you please do that?    Thank you Chairman.    That was it Chairman.    Yes.  Certainly.  It was because we know the position you always take on this and it is slipped through …   This time but we thought if we correct it at the outset …    You would be a satisfied customer …    And know that we do pay attention.    This is what you have said to us Chairman and really apologies.  It slipped through this time again.    Ms Mtshiza if you then look at paginated page 1 and confirm whose name is on - reflected just below the “I, the undersigned”?   Thank you and then if you go to - turn to page 2.  Could you confirm the signature - whose signature that is above the word “deponent”?    And can you confirm to the Chairman where and when you deposed to this affidavit?    You confirm this is your affidavit?    Can you very briefly - I know you have set this out in paragraphs 3 and four - tell the Chairman what this particular - the content of this affidavit represents?    As you please Chairman.    We will do that.   Chairman, we - there are two affidavits.  So we will just complete what is in the first affidavit …    And I think your comments really …    Are …    Are most appropriate with the slightly longer one …   But we will indeed try and …    Expedite that as well.    Ma’am if you could just very tell the - very briefly tell the Chairman what the first 2019 affidavit - what the purpose of this is.    Thank you ma’am.  So if we then go to page 3 will you confirm again that this affidavit is your affidavit?  So on page 3 there is your name.    And then …    If we then go across to page 8 - paginated page 8 you confirm that you are the deponent?   And can you then confirm the place and date of this particular affidavit?    Excellent.  Thank you very much.  We will go straight into the 2017 affidavit because that is where the heart of - of the matter lies.  Please just explain to the Chairman where you are currently employed?    And what position do you occupy in the National Department?    How long have you been employed at the department at which you work?    Could you very briefly just explain to the Chairman what those - I will use the acronym - CASP Conditional Grants are?  What is the essence of that?    I see you have mentioned Black producers a number of times.  Is that one of the - the essential criteria …   For the …    Grant?    Yes and you have also mentioned that these grants are from DORA, but can you explain the relationship between your administration of the grant and National Treasury?    Now the grant is - is applied for and given to the provincial departments.  Am I correct?    You do not give the grant to implementing agents?    Tell - tell …    Please tell the Chairman what exactly a conditional grant is.  I am - I am looking at the oversight role you have.  Why conditional and as you explained that please explain the oversight role that you play because it is a conditional grant?    Could you just clarify one point?  Do you simply throw money at the province and wash your hands of it and just check on how they are using it or in - in what - in the services you provide do you actually physically also assist with let us say infrastructure or with marketing some of the other matters that youhave raised? I - I just want to understand whether it is just the matter of giving money or do you also do other things with the provinces - provinces?    Thank you.  I am really just going through these essential features fairly briefly.  You also have standard operating procedures.  You set that out in your affidavit.   That applies across the board.  We will deal with those in a little more detail slightly further on.    I think what is important is to - to assist the Chairman understand whether the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Free State made a presentation to the National Assessment Panel and what then happen - happened in relation to that.  This would have been in 2012.    In fact can I make a correction?  It would have been in - in 2013.    I am at your paragraph 8.    Who is the Chairman of that particular panel?    And can you give Chairman a - a sense of the expertise that resides in that panel?   Excellent.  Can we then assume that because the Provincial Department Free State was given a CASPallocation that they met your standards on application for that grant?    And as you say in your paragraph they also indicated that they already had an invested part of their equitable share …    In the project?    Chair I notice that it is - it is 1 o’ clock.  Maybe we could take the lunch break now.  If you prefer us to push for another 10 minutes we can do that as well.    No, no.    The next section goes into the actual - the issues that arose (intervenes).    That is the next portion.    Definitely Chairman.    Yes.    We are halfway through this statement Chair.    Yes.     Thank you DCJ.   Ma’am Mshiza are you ready?     We are now dealing with paragraph 9 to paragraph 15 of your 2017 affidavit and this is the area that really deals with what went wrong.   Now you have told us at paragraph 9 that certain concerns were raised by your panel, by the NAP, please take the Chairman through those concerns.    Can I repeat the question Chair?     Ma’am in paragraph 9 you explained that certain concerns were raised by the panel that you Chair, is that correct?     Could you please take the Chairman through those concerns?     That is when you asked them during the process?     Yes.    Can I just probe that one aspect, so when they came to see you and make application for the CASP Grant they did not have the list of beneficiaries.      They did not have a feasibility study that they shared with you, they did not have a business plan that they shared with you.        And they did not have – they couldn’t give you any indication that the EIA’s had been concluded – those applications had been concluded.     Yes, thank you.  On the strength of what they said to you, you were then prepared to give them a grant of R53million?     In fact Chair, just to assist on this particular point a couple of issues maybe that need clarification.  One, you’re saying there would always be follow up engagement or visit after that approval/recommendation phase?     That’s the first thing you’re saying.  Thesecond thing I understand you to be saying is that you have improved on the systems that were in place in 2013?     Thank you Chair, can I also just point you to the CASP funding agreement of 2013/2014 and this you will find in reference bundle F for Freddie, if you go to page 2066 towards the back, there are stickers at the top so there is one that is written 125 it’s right towards the end and that’s where you’ll find page 2066, so it’s reference bundle F for Freddie page 2066, have you found it ma’am?     On the top right-hand corner you havethe page numbers, I can see you are very far from where I want you to be, go right to the back, keep going, you should find 2066 closer to where you are now.     And that is the CASP funding agreement.     If you look over the page to page 2067 you have the signatures of three officials from the Free State Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.     The first one is that of Dr Masiteng.     The second one is that of Ms Dlamini the CFO.     And the third one is that of the HOD Mr Thabethe.     And this document was signed on the 12 t h of June 2013.     Can you briefly take the Chairman through what it is that they were agreeing it to and whom they were agreeing these particular terms with?     So at the time that this agreement was signed National Treasury had not communicated its reservations around the Vrede Dairy Project?     When did you get the first inclination or indication that all was not well with the Vrede Dairy Farm Project?     Can I point you to the same reference bundle but this time to page 2063, exactly where you were but this time it’s a couple of pages before the last one you looked at, 2063.     Is this the letter you refer to dated – it’snot very clear but it’s June 2013, certainly.     As evidence by the stamp on the top right-hand corner?     Can you just give the Chairman the gist of what National Treasury’s reservations were as communicated to your department?     You then decided to go on a site visit?     Please tell the Chairman about that?     Did you go to Bloemfontein or did you go to Vrede?     They were there to receive you, you say in your paragraph 11?     Can I ask this question, because you had such a high powered delegation from your office and from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, was the engagement with the HOD and the coordinator, and the CFO or was it with the people who worked on the farm?     At paragraph 12 you then deal with what you established when you got…[intervenes].     Yes I beg your pardon, in the rushChairman to keep to the time I promised you.     I’m being a little untidy, my apologies Chair.     We are going back to the statement to page six of the statement and its paragraph 12 of HH14 Chairman.     And can you just give the Chairman a sense of how you felt when you – as you were leaving this project, asyou were leaving Vrede, you set that out in paragraph 12.     Can you explain that so the 351 Friesland cows were held or kept at a different site is this what you’re saying?     Did you speak to this vet, do you know where – was he from the department?     A vet from India?    Yes continue.     Did they give an indication on how longthey had kept those particular cattle there and when those cattle would be moved back to the farm proper?     Did they give any indication as to why they had purchased these cattle before the farm itself was ready because you call it a construction site?    Continue because you then go on to speak about water rights not being in place etcetera.  Just take the Chairman through that?    Can I just – Can I just interrupt you there to tidy up one piece?    And that again takes us to page 2069 of Exhibit HH Reference bundle F.  2069 Reference bundle F and am I correct in saying that this is the letter that indicates that even as at the 24 t h February 2014 the application for water rights had not been concluded?    It is just the material fact that we have been debating during the hearings. Thank you continue you were then going to just complete your summary of the items that were red flags.    For you.    Can I again just ask you to – to go to the same Reference bundle F page 2041.  This is a letter written to the then Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Me Tina Joemat-pettersson and it is written by the MEC in the Free State for Agriculture Me Thabethe.  And where …    2041 Chairman.  I have just – this is the particular paragraph I will be referring to Chairman but if you want the beginning of the letter I can give you that page number?    Yes.    Yes.  The letter starts on 2036 Chairman.    Yes and it is dated the 26 t h August 2013.    But the salient portion I want to refer the witness to is at page 2041.    And that paragraph 2 the very last sentence of the paragraph that is titled Phases for Project Deployment    In fact to our knowledge on the evidence that has been led to date 80 beneficiaries certainly – there are no such contracts that have been brought here or that we have been able to find and I thought you might have better information than the commission.    Yes.  Then at your paragraph 13 you – youspeak to the back to office report that you have annexed to this affidavit.  That report Chairman is on paginated page 26 of HH14.  HH14 which is the affidavit of the witness.      Of course Chairman not a problem.    So we are at page paginated 7 one hand is 0 a couple of fingers are holding page 7 which is where paragraph 13 appears Chairman and then the other part – other hand has gone to page 26 which speaks to the issues raised in paragraph 13.  So we looking at paragraph 13 on paginated page 7.  We are also looking at the specific report that is referred to in paragraph 13 which is found on paginated page 26.     Ma’am can you just take the Chairmanthrough without reading the full back to office report.  I think if you take the Chairman through those essential recommendations that you made which you have enumerated at paragraph 13?    Can I just – can I just clarify one point.  I know you have gone past this point.   But if you look at paginated page 30 in HH14 Chairman you will find there a list of eight factors arising from the flaws in the feasibility study.  Is that correct Ma’am?    And it is on the basis of…    Paginated page 30, 30 Chairman.    Yes Chairman.  I think these are importantjust for purposes of giving perspective.    Of the flaws that were in that feasibility study,    Your microphone.    You have then told the Chairman that you – the department decided to – having engaged with the provincialDepartment of Agricultural and Rural Development your department decided to withhold the R53 million that you had allocated.  Can I ask you to go to Exhibit HH Reference bundle B for Barry.  And if you go to page 610 there you will find a letter that confirms what you are saying about the withdrawal of those funds and I would like you to turn to page 611 which is the second page of that letter.  So it starts on 610.    B yes Ma’am.      So the letter starts on page 610.    10.    But I really want to refer you to the second page which is 611.   The last two paragraphs of this letter.  Could you just read that into the record briefly because it confirms what you are saying?    Yes please continue.   Continue into the…    Will be committed.    Now this is a letter that came from the DG in your department and it was directed to the CEO of the Provincial Treasury in the Free State Province Provincial Treasury.    And the date of this letter is the 3 r d December 2013.    So the apron strings were cut on this date?  The money was withdrawn?    So the clear message to them was you did not comply with the conditions that were set, is that correct?  We asked you to correct certain matters you did not do so by the deadline that we had given you and for this reason we are now going to confirm that weare not giving this money for this financial year.    Were there any other engagements after this letter was written and after the money was withdrawn?    Are there any other matters you would like to explain to the Chairman as you conclude your evidence?  I say this possibly because the Chairman might be interested in – in the kinds of partnerships that you would sometimes fund but which partnerships were not PPP’s.  The example you gave us during our consultation might give him a sense of where to place this particular “partnership” that Estina entered into with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development please.    So you are saying the farmers themselves along with their investor partners would approach the department?    And say we have got [indistinct],    We have got equity here.  We have brought the land or whatever it might be.    Here are people we are working with but we need your support.   To scale this operation of ours.    But that of course was a very different model to what happened with the Estina model where an implementingagent was appointed by the Department and the rest followed.    Excellent.  Anything else you would like to share with the Chairman?    Chairman I have no further questions.    Chairman we now have Ms – Advocate Molefe presenting the evidence of Mr Theron.  We have an interpreter to assist Mr Theron.  If we may have a five minute adjournment Chairman so that the interpreter could be sworn in and so the witness can take his seat in the witness stand.  It is a short witness Chairman we will not be very long.    Thank you.    As the court – as the Chairman pleases.     Thank you Chairman.   Chairman this is just a request that you confirm the dates on which Ms Rockman will be appearing before the Commission.    That is correct Chairman.      Thank you Chairman.     All indications Chairman are that the 28 t h of October is the preferred date.      Ms Buthelezi has been trying to sort that out for us while we have been here and that is what she has textedback to us.     I think we should wait Chairman.     And possibly ...[intervenes]      Yes sir. 
MS ELDER MTSHIZA:  Elder Mtshiza.    No.    Yes.    So help me God.    (duly sworn, states)    Yes Chair.  I would like to remove the sworn on the affidavit and it remains just affidavit.    I am saying the - it is written sworn affidavit.  I would like to remove the sworn.   Yes.    It is Elder Mtshiza.  That is my name Chair.    That is my signature.    It was in Pretoria on 1 October 2019.    Yes ma’am.   Yes.    Yes Chair.  The purpose of this affidavit is that I had previously provided a -a sworn affidavit to the South African Police Service.    Provided an affidavit …    To the South African Police Service and this wasin 2017 and this is really to state that I still stand by the contents of the 2017 affidavit which was issued.  Thank you.    Yes.  It is my affidavit.    Elder Mtshiza.    Yes.    It was signed in Pretoria on 3 November 2017.    I am currently employed in the now Department of Agriculture Land Reform and Rural Development.  At the time it was the Department of Agriculture Forest and Fisheries.    In the National Department I am the Program Management Co-Ordinator at the level of a Chief Director responsiblefor the conditional grants - CASP - which is the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Program and Ilima/Letsema Conditional Grants.    I have been with the department since 2010 and since then until today I have been responsible for this portfolio.    Yes.  The CASP Conditional Grant is a grantwhich is governed by the Division of Revenue Act.  At the time of the funding to the Vrede Dairy it was a Schedule 4 Conditional Grant which meant it was meant to supplement equitable share in supporting farmers both smallholder and subsistence in particular and it is mainly for support to Black producers. Just to enable them to increase their production to allow them with acquisition of infrastructure.  To support them with training, capacity building, support them with market access as well as business development.  The Ilima/Letsema Conditional Grant is a Schedule 5 which was a special purpose conditional grant aimed at increasing food production. Mainly for your household food security.  So we would support your household food gardens.  We would do food massification in communal areas but also provide inputs to smallholder farmers who have received infrastructures like your poultry houses or piggerystructures from CASP.  Then you give them the first inputs as start-up inputs for enabling or starting up production on their farms. Also with Ilima/Letsema you could also invest in unlocking infrastructure like your irrigation schemes.  So those are mainly grants that are aimed at giving your Black producers some support that will enable them opportunity to be able to access your loans because at this point in time they do not necessarily have adequate resources or enough capital to actually access loans directly.    The …    The programs …    Are mainly meant for Black producers Chair.    Yes.  National Treasury Chair is the - the body that governs the Division of Revenue Act and that has also appropriated funds which we then distribute to provinces that has been appropriated for Division of Revenue Act.  So as a - as is given within the Division of Revenue Act both National Treasury have powers to release as well as to withhold where there are concerns. The same way as the transferring of (indistinct) which in thiscase was a delegated function or is a delegated function to myself has the powers to release or to withhold the - the funds that has been disbursed if there is any non-compliance or any violation to legislation or non-compliance to the framework that has been issued.    Yes ma’am.    No.  The allocations are made directly to theProvincial Departments of Agriculture and the process for which the farmers are able to access these grants is through the application to the provinces.  So the application would also start at local level.  There are committees that would receive those applications for farmers that need support and if they are in line with what has been prioritised commodities of that - at that time and they are ready for implementation. You would then - the local would present their cases to district and sometimes it is really on the basis of limited resources.  So the district will then select the ones that they will want to present to the provincial committee and at the provincial committee they would have to be signed off by the accounting authority and consolidated into one application of the province against the budget that has been allocated to that province but it is not just a given. So the province must then come and according to the Divisionof Revenue Act that application needs to be received by the National Department on 30 September.  So the National Department will receive all applications from provinces and we will schedule a meeting of the National Assessment Panel.  After the penal because a panel comprises of a number of expertise within the department who need to look into the plans of the - of the provinces within each project. So we will schedule that panel meeting with is the NAP meeting and the provinces will then be invited to come and present each one’s case in that.  So when we receive we receive a plan of a province with all the projects that they want to achieve and what impactthose would - would achieve and the panel will deliberate after the province has presented and a decision will be made to say we can recommend to the Director-General that a business plan for this province should be approved or not.    Hm.    Yes.  The conditional grant Chair is that you cannot use this money for anything else but for what it was approved for.  So in this instance with CASP we would approve it for establishment of an infrastructure on the farmer’s farm.  We would approve it for providing that farmer with training capacity in terms ofcoaching/mentorship. We would approve that grant to that farmer if you are going to assist that farmer with market infrastructure or also post-harvest infra - services.  So the - you cannot use it for any other purpose that it was not intended for.    We - as I had indicated the responsibility to implement is that of the province.  So we would confirm first that a province has the capacity that they need and if they do not then you will avail the resources or expertise that they may need for such a project to be executed. We will also do oversight visits ourselves just to monitor whether the plan has - is being implemented as was approved by - by national.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes Chair.  We received the business plan ofthe province as is expected and one of the projects which were presented to the NAP included the Vrede Dairy.    Yes.    This was during the 30 t h to 31 January - NAP Meeting of the 30 t h to 31 January where the first date means that representation of their plan and the Vrede Dairy Project in particular to the National Assessment Panel.    I am the Chairman of the panel.    Yes Chair.  In the panel we have water use and irrigation experts.  We have the agricultural economist.  We have animal specialists, crop production specialists.  We do fund extension support.  So we have colleagues from extension services just to make sure that the plans are in line with the extension plan framework. We have training experts from the department to look at the - whether the skills audits were done for the farmers that needs to be trained as has been requested and look deeper into the training plans of those provinces.  We also have market colleagues who are specialists in market assess and agro processing who are sitting in thepanel. So each member of the panel within each province will go into their critical niche and evaluate of the nine provinces and make comments in terms of the - their inputs that the province needs to look at or satisfy themselves that the province had met the technical standards that is required for that project to be executed.  Such that when we make the recommendation that the plan should be approved. Minor issues which we can still follow through and do.  We have a holistic agreement in terms of their focus.  It is in line with the policy imperatives and the - already progress in terms of the technical standards that are met.  We would approve with certain conditions that will need to be met to enable the province to start with the execution of - of those plans.    Yes.  The - in particular on the Vrede Dairy Chair it was one of the big projects of the Free State and the conceptualisation which was captured in their business plan was quite exciting and we were quite happy with what was contained in their presentation that was made to - to the NAP.    Yes.   The standard operating procedure encourages provinces to look for private investment.  To that effect is that we are quite aware that our resources are limited and to extend our rent it is better to bring in private partners to co invest with Government but mainly for the funding and secondly for the skill which should also then be distributed to our beneficiaries but also some of our beneficiaries are not necessarily at that point ready to participate along the value chain in the secondary value chain. So that on it is - on it is own allows them to participate along the value chain.  So it was quite exciting that there is already a partner and also there was a - a high level executive approval from the province which meant there would definitely be some guarantee in terms of equitable share together with our conditional grants enabling the development of that project.    Yes.  Chair remember when we approved there were a number of questions which the panel had asked in terms of readiness to implement and one of them was a feasibility study.  On site we were hoping – our letter said we will get there and you will present and provide documentation that was requested by the National Assessment Panel.  So the feasibility report was also not issued on site to us.  The business plan presentation was also not made but theproject manager without a business plan he knew what needed to happen.  And that was also a concern by the Agricultural – the Chief Agricultural Economist that we were with.  We also were concerned that during the presentation the province had indicated that an application for water rights was done.  But on site they could not also provide us with evidence of their application for water rights but they had…     Hm.     According to this letter yes Chair.    Yes.     And there was also an indication Chair about the beneficiaries.  So when we were on site one of the things we mentioned was that we would have liked to interface with them so that we also get from them what they understand about what the project is all about. But in the absence of them being part of the meeting can webe availed that list of beneficiaries and it was also not made available to us on site.       No Chair.     No Chair we – as I indicated we did not get the beneficiaries nor were we presented with a list which we requested atthe meeting.  When we left the meeting we had agreed with the HOD that he – because he indicated that there is a l list of beneficiaries but he did not talk to contracts.  So maybe they did enter into them later I am not sure.  So there were – to conclude our visit we made a list of the things that needed to come to us because we could not make any engagement technically and that was supposed to be a technical visit on site.  We then requested that the feasibility report be submitted to us, the list of beneficiaries be sent to us, the business plan also be sent to us, the EIA be sent to us.       Chair when we came back we were then – the province met their deadlines of submitting to the [indistinct] that we had requested but we only received the feasibility report and agreement between the province and Estina.  We did not receive the business plan.  The Agricultural Economists and our dairy expert then engaged on that documentation because we really had to make decisions and make decisions very quickly.  And their concerns where that – that wasreally not a feasibility – a proper feasibility study for the Vrede Dairy because it did not give them much content around Vrede which they wanted and they had highlighted a number of concerns with the assumptions which were made.  The profitability of the entity as had been projected in the feasibility report.   And just to go through to our recommendations.  They then recommended that the basis through which the approval was made was false because of the documentation that came through even the application form for water rights did not accompany so he made an assumption being site when the HOD told us that he is meeting with the Department of Water the next day from our meeting that that would only be the time that they are going to be making the application.  So we recommended that the – because the basis through which we made the approval was false the province must now conduct a proper feasibility study for the project and also that feasibility study will then inform a proper business plan that they mustconclude on the applications for water rights and because there was some indication of livestock that might and we would not know whether in the business execution there would be some change in breed given that you have an international entity that which is Paras at the time that is going to bring some of its intellect into how milk should be produced because as was indicated by these experts the quantities which were projected in that plan were too ambitious and not even achieved by the high performing dairy producers in the country.  That the province must conduct also biological impact study and also for these reasons therefore we cannot confidently continue with funding the projectbecause we believe technically all technical processes were not properly followed and the funds must therefore be withheld.  So to that end we completed this report to inform the Director General and we issued the last final letter that the funds should be withheld and the balance of the funding can be released back to the National Revenue Fund or support projects within the province which we knew existed and still needed funding and some of which were owing the Agriculture Credit Board.  But for us to conclude whether the funds must then be redirected we needed now detail of the projects that we identified against the balance of the fund and we sent teams out to confirm that the work that is proposed by the province for the other projects is what should happen and upon approval by the panel we then rediverted the funds from Vrede Dairy to these other projects.  So…     Hm.     That is correct Chair.     Okay.  One what was reached Chair is that large parts of the feasibility study covers standard theoretical information with no details.     Sorry.  With no details on the project itself.  For an example the document covers alternative approaches of doing things, what to look for, when planning without a final statement on how things will be done in this project and in particular and where will they source what and at what cost?  For an example you would have expected them to have factored in the costs for feeds.  The costs forwater and at what cost will – and will where will that be sourced so that it informs your business plan and your business plan’ projected profit can then be confirmed to be true.  The study does not make any comments on the total water needed and ability to provide it.  This is an aspect that needs to be verified by specialists such as engineers specialising in this field for both the fresh water and surface water.  No documentation of the water rights has been provided.  The document does not make any comment on the involvement of small holder farmers.  Their location, who they are, their current productivity and infrastructural requirements.  Nothing is mentioned on how theirproduction will be managed to meet specific requirements pricing, collecting etcetera.  And this was because we understood that there would also be the recipients of cattle from and produce it on their farms as well the milk.  The conception rate at 60% is low and it is not in line with the high mild production assumption in the business plan.  The number of cows needed for mating at a 60% concentration rate will be in the order of 830.  This will result in a very high percentage of dry cows.  The normal acceptable rate for dry cows in the herd is in the order of about 20%.  The general economic assumption which was on page 56 of the 63 document that was submitted needed further clarity.  The amounts for some cases could well be challenged while others could be part of a double counting in the broader perspective.  The assumption of 45 litres milk per cow per day is too good to be true. Some of the leading milk producers in the country will a long build-up of quality dairy herds recorded in the order of 30 litres milk per cow perday.  The implication could well be that the estimated profits for the business be reduced to 60% of what is recorded currently in the plan.  There is no mention of the biological impact of the project and no documentation to this effect has been provided. The market approach is not clarified.  Probably this would have been covered in full in the business plan but the business plan is not available.  So this was the documentations Chair which I received from the Agricultural Economists and the dairy specialists in the department.      This is Reference bundle B?     Apologies I took F     This is page 600 and?     10.     Yes Chair.      “The Province has failed to meet the 1 s t November deadline.  Also National Treasury has commissioned a forensic audit” Is that the one Chair?     Okay. “Also National Treasury has commissioned a forensic audit of the project which was expected to end on 31 s t October 2013.  However the results of the forensic audit have not been communicated to us.”      “In these circumstances no funds will be communicated to …”      “Will be committed to the project at this stage from the CUSP and [indistinct] conditional grants.  The NAP meeting that was planned to recommend projects for ministerial support for the 2014/15 hasbeen rescheduled from December 2013 to February 14 to allow a turn by turn meeting between the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, National Treasury, Provincial Department of Agriculture and Provincial Treasuries which I hope you will prioritise.”     That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.     The money was withdrawn but it was withdrawn already in August Chair after the visit.  Here the Director General was responding to the requests or the question that was asked by the Provincial Treasury whether – to confirm whether we are still in support of the project or not.  So the Director General was now just putting the record straight to say not – we are not.     That is correct Chair.     Yes Chair.  When we wrote the back to office report we made the report also available to the province and requested a meeting to try and find ways of supporting the province in meeting the expectation as stated in the letter.  So the offer to provide additional technical support by the province was also not accepted or responded to.    Yes Chair.  We have had communities with arable land which is big enough to be commercialised but they will not necessarily have the skill nor the capital to put or to tap into that opportunity. So they will identify a private partner and get into an agreement with a private partner to develop their land as a commercial entity.  And what they – because they do not necessarily have the skill, you do not have the capital but they have land the technical partner willthen develop a full comprehensive business plan and together with the community approach the department.  In this instance it would be the Provincial Department and the Provincial Department would love the proposed project and it is in line with our objectives and imperatives and that support will then happen on that.  But we will agree to support that type of a project by putting up their required infrastructure.  One of such projects which was a partnership between the community and the private entity which was not necessarily a PPP was the support to [indistinct] macadamia in the Eastern Cape.  So the evidence leader was asking if we have had other partnerships that we have supportedbeyond this and we gave that type of an example.  In this instance the partnership was not initiate by the department.  The partners came to the department to say we have this opportunity could you help and the assets that you establish and the land is part of the contribution of the community.  And then…     That is correct.     Yes.     That is correct.     Yes.     That is correct.  And in this instance you will see what is the rand value that the partner is bringing on the table plus their skill and they would also do a lot of lobbying for additional funding from other sources just including the banks just to support and we would join in too – ensure that we turn that land into a commercial asset of that community.     That is correct Chair.  And probably as we would be guided by National Treasury that is why they then informed us that that is a model that is fully in line with what they have prescribed as a PPP.     That is it Chair.  Thank you.     Thank you Chair. 
MS ELDER MSHIZA:   Yes I am.     Thank you Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair as I explained when the plan is presented by the Province and project of this magnitude is presented, and as Iindicated the panel was quite excited about it.  We had already received a presentation that said the work has already started in terms of construction so the panel just wanted to check all the technical issues to see, was the disability concluded, was it positive, is water rights in place and is there enough water, has the quality been confirmed and these responses were responded to positively.     During the map process.     We were also quite excited that the project is going to benefit a hundred beneficiaries and – because the Province had already indicated that some will be milking.  We also wanted to understand the content around the logistical arrangement of collecting the milk and bringing it to the facility.  So we understood that there will be production that happens off site in those farmer’s lands as well as what is happening within the facility because all that documentation was not with us, we then concluded by saying that we need to be provided with a list of beneficiaries and we must also be – the Province must keep records, like your feasibility study, your business plan ready for as and when it’s needed…[intervenes].     Yes.    Yes.     Chair the documentation was not part of the presentation but all these questions which were asked by the panel, were responded to positively.  I remember with the water, they had saidtheir application was already done with the Department of Water Affairs.  So we were comfortable to let it go because in terms of the technical steps that needed to be done, the Province had actually indicated that they had already started or concluded some of these processes which included completion of the feasibility study which is positive, the application of water rights which has already been lodged, the EIA which was concluded and so on.     Yes, we then – the Province came requesting for R53million from CASP and R22million from [indistinct] and we felt if you approve R75millionn all at once it’s actually too heavy of the intention of the grant so we only approved the R53million that we said we will be able to recommend for approval to the Director General…[intervenes].    R53million and we then declined the R22million because it was actually going to affect negatively the drive of Feza Gala programme because that money was earmark for [indistinct] which is Food Massification as I had indicated.     Of the Division of Revenue Act yes.     That would satisfy itself that we can recommend for approval.     The actual decision for approval would be made by the Director General.  So when the panel concludes I will then develop a submission and pull all the documentation with the final national business plan which I would have compiled.     And present to the Director General for approval.     Yes Chair.    Yes.     Yes Chair like I said CASP was a schedule 4 conditional grant at the time which means it was meant to supplement equitable share so the Province’s plan which is a plan to develop farmers would then be the one that is presented to the panel forapproval which would then signal key projects which then would be driven and for what purpose would your money now be used for and in this instance because this was a mega request on one project, although it benefited a hundred beneficiaries at the time their technical experts which are the members of the panel would then want to delve deeper into understanding how far has the province gone in developing the plan towards it’s implementation.  Hence we requested that all that documentation be kept safe for as and when it is required.  What would then follow Chair would be a monitoring visit by the different expertise who would then engage with the documentation with the Province and where there’s a need for strengthening or picking up issues we will then do that.     Chair one would have expected that we probably go deeper into requesting the actual documentation but if you go into what the standard operating procedure at that time was saying, it – as I indicated the implementation was with the Province so ours was to make sure and satisfy ourselves that they had gone through proper and I think it was more initial trust that you know that the accounting officerwhich is the head of the department is also obliged to abide  by the prescripts of the regulations that governed that and at a point where their response to the questions of they’re not favourable responded to or you feel that there are gaps then your hold their approval process and then go and make a follow through because the same technical within the National Department are expected to be present at a Provincial Department but some of the improvements that we have made to the programme in particular, just to try and close these gaps because we realised that – just to give you an indication Chair, in one sitting the panel would be receiving presentations from all nine provinces with about 1 500 projects that would be executed for the next financial year.  So you then check with each and every province, bringing in, in terms of the work that they have done and on that basis a project gets approved and then there’s follow through, oversight to confirm thatwhat has been said is actually what has happened and is the project executed as is.  So it was more really an issue of capacity but also to understand that we are concurrent implementers here.  So you do your job, I do my job and I come and say, have you done all that you need to have done and you will say, yes I’ve done all what I’ve need to have done.  So as colleagues we will then agree that you have done what you need to do and I have checked and confirmed with you that you have done what you need to do and I would record it as such and on the basis of what the record then we take it further to say, we can recommend that this is approved because it is stated that – so youwould always say it is stated that this and this and this and then you will schedule visits and then go and verify all that information.  So there will be different teams now that goes to all nine provinces and make sure that the projects are visited and confirm that they meet the standards as has been – unless there’s a problem with one particular province or they extend the quality of the presentation, it’s such that the province – because they will bring in a strong delegation of their expertise to engage with the technical expertise at [indistinct].  So to an extent that the province had failed to convince the panel that they are ready, then we would not recommend for approval and we would schedule a follow up meeting within that province and before that meeting we would send teams because we’ll now be sitting with a list of projects that were earmarked for support and our technical teams will just go about, so that by the time that we sit with the province we now have detail, having been on site tounderstand what the issues are.     Had approved that without documentation.     That’s what I’m saying Chair.     At that time we had only the terms of reference for the panel and the guiding documents would then be the grant frameworks as well the Division of Revenue Act.     Yes.     Yes Chair, similarly as I had indicated the CASP was a schedule 4 conditional grant and with a schedule 4 if you go to the Division of Revenue Act, a province need not really submit a business plan, that’s now if you go into what a schedule 4 is all about.  You can come and say we have agricultural projects to support and you need not submit a business plan.  Whereas a schedule 5 conditional grant requires that you must submit a business plan.  We then moved- because some of the learnings of the past enables you to improve, weapproached National Treasury and we have since changed their schedule for conditional grant CASP.  So CASP is now a schedule 5 conditional grant so it is now mandatory for such documentation to be presented.     To the National Department.     I have reference bundle F.     Yes I have found it.     Yes Chair.     That’s correct Chair.    Yes Chair.     Yes.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes Chair.     Chair after the business plan has beenrecommended for approval and the Director General has approved their business plan, we then get into another agreement with the province.  So these are now the conditions that the province will commit to abide to in executing the project in that financial year.  So it would state the total grant funding to the province and the province will then say we agree to all these 11 conditions which are set now in the agreement as the rule or the non-negotiable and the head of the department, the Chief Financial Officer as well as the CASP coordinator in the province, in that instance it was Dr Masiteng would then have to sign the agreement and then submit back to us.  Upon receipt of theseagreements we will take all the agreements to National Treasury and only after the agreement is signed can we release the funds.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair it was in July when we received a letter from National Treasury, their concern was that they had picked up that the Vrede Dairy is a public/private partnership and that the province did not follow due process for a public/private partnership and as such they are in violation of Regulation 13.61 and any continued expenditure on this project will equal to unlawful expenditure.  As a result they are requesting that we should withhold their conditional grant.  The Divisionof Revenue does allow in terms of withholding of conditional grants that, that process can be initiated by National Treasury or by the transferring officer and there are conditions through which you can do that and one of them is if there is any violation to any Treasury Regulations or – yes thank you Chair.     Yes Chair.     Yes it was, it’s the same letter Chair which was received by our department and it was dated 26 June but the office of the Director General received it on the 3 r d of July 2013.     The stamp on the top yes Chair.     In the letter Chair, it’s actually paragraph two, the nature of the arrangement was that a PPP as I had explained has been entered into by the department but the department had failed to follow due process which means that it should have registered the PPP with Treasury and also informed relevant Treasury that the expertiseexists within their private partner which they are entering into.     Yes Chair.     When we received the instruction from National Treasury the first thing you do really is to abide by their requests.  So according to the Division of Revenue Act we then issue an intention to withhold the funds but because, as I had indicated we were sold onto the project and we really wanted to see this anchor within the Free State particularly in the identified sites we then sent the letter ofintention to withhold the province to say they should state this is what the National Treasury’s concerns are and they should tell us why we shouldn’t withhold the funds.  We then received the response from the province which then outlined all the approval by the Executive Authorities and all that but it was not addressing the fact that there was a dispute whether this is a PPP from the Provincial letter that we received.  So we initiated a letter back to the province requesting that, to resolve this dispute – because technically we are all in agreement that this plan should be executed.  We now need to meet as four parties to resolve these – and see how best do we correct that wrong but before that meeting we then decided, actually we approved on the basis of the information that was presented to us so let’s then go on site visit and go and confirm our technical facts, so that by the time we meet we know we are together with the province in enforcing that the project is continuing.    We went to Vrede and we met with the HOD, Dr Masiteng and their CFO and the District Manager at Vrede.    Yes, they were there to receive us and they took us through the site inspections and their technical team was now engaging and it could only engage with them because the implementing part now was not there.    It was with the HOD, the coordinator and the CFO plus their Project Manager who was on site at that time and the District Manager also, I think, she was also part of the meeting.  So it was not with the people on the farm because the ones who were on the farm were really the ones who were working, busy with construction.     Chair we found that there was work going on and a lot of work was already done as stipulated here, we were also taken to the site where there were cattle kept…[intervenes].     Yes, they were in Vrede but they were not at the construction site because there was construction.  So they were kept in the veld where they were grazing and there was a vet looking after them and some headmen when we got there.     We spoke to the vet he was not from the department Chair he was also coming from India yes.     Yes Chair.     He could speak English Chair but it was not very perfect English but we could…[intervenes].     We could understand each other.     I don’t remember that part of the discussion Chair.     Yes, there were timelines with regard to when they anticipated the construction of the building to happen and they felt to have a parallel process through which you are now getting the vet familiar with the livestock and showing that they are properly nourished as they had indicated they were anticipating certain level of productivity from these cattle and I think it was merely – because I  don’t think there was any key reason Chair, 2013, I might not remember all the facts but we were not necessarily finding it odd but yes.
ADV REFILOE MOLEFE:  Yes Chair we are ready to proceed.    Thank you Chair.  As mentioned by Advocate Gcabashe we will be continuing with the evidence related to the Vrede Dairy Project and the next witness whom we are calling is Mr Johannes Cornelis Hermanus Theron.  Chair a bundle marked HH15 is placed before you and we beg leave to have that bundle admittedinto the evidence as such.    Thank you Chair.    Might I request that the witness be sworn in?    Thank you Chair.    Please refer to the bundle that is before you.  It is marked HH15.  Do you see it?    And if you open that bundle starting at page 1of that document all the way through to page 5 of that document.  Are you able to identify that document?    Is that your statement to the Commission?    Yes and if you turn to page 5 of that document there - are you there?    There appears a date at the bottom of that statement.  26 September 2019.  Is that the date on which you deposed to this affidavit?    And there appears also a signature above the word “deponent”.  Is that your signature?   When you drafted this statement Mr Theron did you understand its contents?    And as I understand …    Pardon me Chair.    I am highly indebted.    And the contents contained in this affidavit as we have understood you gave evidence in Afrikaans?    The statement is in English.    Did you read the statement?    Did you understand the contents of the statement?   As - if we go through this statement are there any corrections you wish to make to the statement?    So would …?    Would the correct spelling be C-O-R-N-E-L-I-S?    Thank you.  Are there any other further corrections you wish to make?    Thank you Mr Theron.  Do you now …?    Thank you.    Do you now confirm the correctness of yourstatement?    Do you confirm the correctness of your statement?    Thank you.  Mr Theron please tell the Chair what you currently do for a living?   And where do you stay?    Do you have any experience relative to the dairy farming industry?    And who is Mr Neuman?    And where was Mr Neuman’s farm located?    And did Mr Neuman won this farm or was he leasing it?    And how large was this farm    What expertise if any Mr Theron would be required in managing a dairy farm?    Can you repeat that again please?  To manage …    And what factors would you consider to be key in a dairy farm?    And would things such as water, irrigation be quite key in a dairy farm?    Okay.  Can we then turn to page 2 of your statement starting at paragraph 6 thereof?  You narrate events that took place in or around the middle of the year 2012.  Is that correct?    Can you please tell the Chair what happened during this time?    Yes.    Can I just go back to what you said?  You said that you were informed by your employer?    Is this Mr Neuman?    And did he tell you who contacted him?    He did not tell you?    Okay.  Then you have just told the Chair that on that day there was a delegation of people who went to the farm.  Which farm would this be?    And why were you requested to show people how you were doing things?    Mr Theron can I ask you to just move your mic a bit forward.  Apparently there is technical issues because you are too close.  That is better.  Thank you very much.  So these people who came to the farm who were you told these people were?    Yes and what did you do in relation to this request of showing them how things are done?  As you have put it at Mr Neuman’s dairy farm.    You earlier mentioned that there were four persons from the municipality.  Did I get that correctly?    And who were these persons?    Can I confirm the spelling of Motaung as you have it at paragraph 7 of your statement?  Is that M-O-T-A-U-N-G?    And what role did Mr Motaung play in this meeting?    And who was leading this delegation that visited the farm?   When you say the vet from India is the Chair to understand that the vet was of Indian decent?    From India?    And you say as far as you recall Mr Prasadwas also present?    And the other people in the delegation you have told the Chair about 20 people having visited the farm.  Is that correct?    Of the 20 you say about four were officials including Mr John Motaung.  Is that correct?    That leaves on my count about 16 people being present.  Is that correct?    And from that 16 you say that someone who was the vet was present?    And you do not recall his or her name?    Was the person male or female?    Was the vet male or female?    And in addition to the vet you say possibly Mr Prasad?    And who were the remaining people of thedelegation?    If we turn to paragraph 7 of your statement which is on page 2 of that bundle you make a comment about your observations relative to the Indian delegation.  Is that correct?    Can you please tell your - the Chair about your observations in this respect?    I will do so.  At - are you at paragraph 7 …    Of your statement?  You are - you make acomment about your observation relative to the Indian delegation.  Is that correct?    And can you please tell the Chair what you observed in respect of the Indian delegation?    So when you say some were from India andthe others were not how were you able to draw this distinction that you have just made between those you say were from India and those you say were not from India?    What in your opinion was the vet’s experience relative to dairy farming?    I am sorry.  Can you please repeat thatagain?    Okay.  So when you were showing this delegation how you were operating at Mr Neuman’s farm the Chair is to understand that you were doing a walkabout.  Is this correct?    And how long did this last?    Now if a person does not have experience in managing a dairy farm would the walkabout be sufficient in equipping them to manage a dairy farm?    And what is …    And can I just interrupt what is an AI Course?    Yes.  Please continue.   What then happened after you gave them the walk - after the walkabout at Mr Neuman’s dairy far?    Yes.   Can I refer you to paragraph 10 of your statement and that appears from page 3 of that bundle?  You have just told the Chair that it was about a month later.  Is this a month later from the visit at the farm?    And you say you were contacted by Mr Ashok and is the spelling there N-A-R-A-Y-A-N at chapter - pardon me.  At paragraph 10 of your statement the spelling of Mr Ashok’s surname?    You said he contacted you.  How did he contact you?    Yes and what did he say?    When he said they do you recall who he was referring to?    Yes and did he tell you where this meeting would take place?   And did he tell you who would be attending the meeting?    Yes.  Now if you turn again to paragraph 10 of your statement.  You speak about urgency.  Is that correct?    Can you explain to the Chair what this urgency you speak of was about?    Is that what was said to you?    Your …    Yes.  So Mr Narayan calls you and he asks you to meet him in Johannesburg and he says that this meeting will take place - place in Saxonwold.  Is that correct?    Did he say where in Saxonwold?    Yes.  So after this conversation over the phone with Mr Narayan what then happened?    Yes and …    Yes.  So you have this discussion with Mr Neuman.  You are in agreement that there is an opportunity for you to sell your cattle?    And did you accept Mr Narayan’s meeting invite?    And did you go to Saxonwold at the address provided to you by Mr Narayan?    And how soon after the telephone call with Mr Narayan did you go to Saxonwold?    Yes.  Can you recall whether the property at which this meeting was to take place was an office or a residential property?    Yes and what happened when you arrived at the property?    Yes and were they expecting you?    Is - so you drive to the property.  You are met by about three security personnel at the gate and they take you to Mr Narayan inside the premises?    Did you see …?    Thank you Chair and you were then taken to Mr Narayan?    Did you meet anyone else other than Mr Narayan?   Did you know whose property the meeting at which you had gone belonged?    Yes.    Yes.  So you then …    Thank you Chair.  So you are then met by Mr Narayan.  Has Mr Neuman arrived at this point?    Okay.  So what then happens after you are met by Mr Narayan?    Now you …    Yes.  Is that what he said?    Now just at the outset of this meeting what was your understanding of Mr Narayan’s role in respect of Estina?    Yes.    You also made mention of your understanding of Mr Narayan’s role and I use the word “mediator” in quoting you.  Now in relation to Mr Ace Magashule what was your understanding ofMr Narayan’s relationship with Mr Magashule?    So what was the purpose of this meeting?    And in advising and consulting were you told who you would be engaging with in your role as advisors and consultants - to use your words?    And who were these people introduced as?     Who – you speak of the vet, correct?     You also speak of a young student.     The vet that you refer to is it the same vetyou met in Free State during the walkabout?     And you also speak of a young student, is that correct.     Who was this young student introduced as?     And did they tell you what his experience isin farming?     And was there any discussion around what the nature of his experience is?     So you meet at the property you havedescribed as being located in Saxonwold, you meet with Mr Narayan and you say that Mr Newman joins an hour later, is that correct?     And how long was your meeting with Mr Narayan before you started speaking to the vet and the young gentleman you speak of?     Yes, and did you and Mr Narayan come toany agreement?     And you earlier said that he had sought advice and consulting assistance from you relative to dairy farming, was that correct?     So after meeting with Mr Narayan was it Mr Narayan who then introduced you to the vet and the young man at the same meeting?     But was it at the same property?     On the same day?     Yes, and what did you discuss between yourself and the vet as well as the young gentleman who you say you were told would be managing the dairy farm.     When you say that they said they wanted to milk a thousand cows what was the frequency, would this be a thousand cows daily or how frequent did they intend to milk these cows?     So that would be ...[intervenes]      Milked twice a day.     Thank you.   So they told you about their intentions and what do you and Mr Newman say?     And was there any advice that you shared with them at this meeting?     Yes, so after having this conversation with them what was your impression about the vet and the young gentleman’s understanding of the importance of climates in dairy farming?     And did they share with you how they became involved in the project?     Did they tell you how they became involved in the dairy project?     Okay, and how did the meeting conclude how did it end?     Now having spoken to them over a couple of hours as you have said what was your impression on their capabilities or expertise in running and managing a dairy farm in the Vrede area?     Okay.     Yes, so still at this meeting in Saxonwold you’ve had a discussion with Narayan, you have also had a discussion with the vet as well as a young Indian man.  Did you meet anyone else at the property?     Did you then leave after your meeting?     And when did you agree with Mr Narayan on these fees?     Yes.     Thank you Chair.   Mr Theron you earlier made mention to an amount of one billion rand is that correct?     Where do you get this amount from?     Yes, and at paragraph 14 of your statement on page 3 you give your opinion on or share your views on this amount of R1billion, can you please tell the Chair about your views in respect?     Then paragraph 17 and 18 of your statement as it appears at page 4 of the bundle you set out what appears to be you and Mr Newman’s interest in the project.  You have earlier – is that correct – you have earlier told the Chair that you saw an opportunity to sell cattle to Estina, is that correct?     And at what cost were you anticipating tosell cattle to Estina?     That you would sell it for R12 000 a cow?     I understood you to say that the cows that you intended to sell were selling at approximately R8 000 at that time,is that correct?     Oh I see.     Thank you Chair.   And paragraph 18 of your statement still on the same page you then speak to the supplier of plant and – dairy plant, pardon me, and equipment, is that correct?     Can you please tell the Chair what it is you set out in that respect?     And can you recall what type of equipment or machine you had recommended to be sold by Alfa Laval to Estina?     And how much did this machine cost?     And would that be the fair market value?     You also told the Chair that yourself and Mr Newman each received R30 000?     And you received this R30 000 from who?     And is one to understand this to be in relation to recommending them to Estina?     As a spotter’s fee?    Right, then at paragraph 19 of your statement, still on page 4 of your bundle you set out what happened some few months later, is that correct?     Please tell the Chair what happened.     Please tell the Chair what happened as you have set it out at paragraph 19 of your statement.     Did – before speaking to Mr Prassad, and after your meeting at Saxonwold did you speak to anyone in respect of the dairy project?   Did you – let me rephrase my question, pardon me Mr Theron, after your meeting at Saxonwold did you hear form Mr Narayan again?    Yes.     When you say he was very sensitive what do you mean?     And is that the reason you went to see Mr Prassad?     And you say Mr Prassad – you again used the word sensitive?    What did Mr Prassad say to you?     Yes and you have just told the Chair that that this was during the time when the cattle started dying?     Then at paragraph 20 of your statement, in fact before moving onto paragraph 20 did you do anything else in relation to the Vrede Dairy Project?    Then if we move to paragraph 20 of your statement, that is on page 5, you speak about Mr John Motaung is that correct?     What is it that you are telling the Chair about Mr John Motaung?     So you do not have personal knowledge of that?     Then the last ...[intervenes]      Thank you Chair.  Then the last issue thatyou have dealt with in your statement relates to the termination of the lease of Mr Newman’s farm and that you deal with at paragraph 8 of your statement, so you might just have to turn a few pages back, that is page 2.   Is that correct?     What knowledge do you have about the termination of the lease?     Which people?     And ...[intervenes]      Can you recall whether there was just one meeting or more than one meeting?     And what was discussed at the three meetings.    Yes, and what knowledge do you have about the subsequent termination of the lease?     After those meetings do you know what then eventually happened?     Yes.     Thank you Mr Theron, is there anything else you wish to bring to the Chair’s attention about this project?    Thank you Mr Theron.   Chair we have no further questions for Mr Theron.     No Chair, there is nothing, thank you. 
MR JOHANNES CORNELIS HERMANUS THERON:  That is correct - correct Your Honour.    Johannes Cornelis Hermanus Theron.    No your honour.    Yes.    So help me God.  (duly sworn, states)    Yes.  I have got it.    Yes.  I identify it.  That is my statement.    Yes.    That is correct.  That is my signature.  I complete understand it.  Thank you.    Yes.  It was red to me.    That is correct.    Ja.    I have read it.    I understand it completely.    Yes Chair.  On page 1 there is a minor spelling mistake in my name.  Just for the record I want to correct it.  It is not Cornelius but Cornelis without the U.  Please take out the U.    That is correct.    Yes Chair.  I refer to paragraphs 4, six, eight, nine, 17 and 18.  My employer’s name was spelt incorrectly.  It is Neuman but the correct spelling is N-E-U-M-A-N.  Please correct it like that.    That is all - that is all thank you.    Pardon.    I do.    Yes.    Chair I am - I am a retired dairy farmer and for the last four years I am an estate agent in the town of Memel.    I stay in Memel.    Chair I was a dairy farmer myself for 34 years and for six years I was a dairy manager for the Neuman Farming Enterprising.    It was my employer.    Halfway between Memel and Vrede.   Well he - he owns about 30 000 hectares in that area.  So that is - that was his own farm.    30 000 hectares.  Well good discipline, good knowledge for feeding the cows, seeing to their healthand very important is to manage the labour.  (Intervenes) to manage the labour.    Well I think the biggest factor is the bottom line is whether you are making as profit or not.    Yes.  Water is life.  Water means production of feed which is a key element in producing milk.  Yes.  You cannot go without water.   That is correct.  Chair I was approached by my employer that we will have a visit from a delegation from the new project Vrede Dairy Project and they wanted to see how we are doing things because we were a - a model dairy farm in theVrede area and they wanted to see how we are doing things …    And that day there arrived about 20 people on the farm.  Four of which was from the municipality and plus/minus 16 was from an Estina dairy company from India.    That is correct.    That is correct.    No.    No.   It was the farm of my - my employer Mr Neuman and he ordered me to show the people around of how we are - were doing things.    Because I was acknowledged as a great expert - expert on dairy farming due to mylong …    Long time doing dairy …    And he - they - they expect me to know everything and to show - show the people how we are doing things?    Well I was told that it was a delegation from the Estina Dairy Company from India and also from the Vrede Municipality.   Ja.  Well they arrived in their cars.  Mostly Mercedes Benz’s and I showed them around on the farm.  From rearing the calves, the milking process itself and where the cows were in the camps.  Feeding - where they were fed.    That is correct yourhonour.    The one was the Mayor Mr John Motaung and the other three I cannot remember but they were related to the Municipality.    That is correct.    Well he did not show much interest but just strolling around with us.  I was a bit disappointing about his understanding of the dairy business.    Well as I - it is a long time ago but I - as I remember it was the vet and I have forgotten his name.  The vet from India as well as Mr Prasad.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.   No.    Pardon.    Male?    Ja.    Well it was Indians and I - I cannot remember their names.  It is impossible to just - 16 people and remember their names.  I - I am not that good.    That is correct.    Can you repeat your question Chair?    Ja.    That is correct.    Well during our visit to the farm you could - I mentioned that some of these people stick together and the other going on their own way.  That is why I understand it that they were - some were from India and the other not.    Well I - I have judged them on the questions - the type of questions they asked me.  I have seen that the - the people from India was well experienced in dairy farming and the other not.    Well I could he knows something about the dairy but he was not an expert and that he was not used to the situation in South Africa and especially in the Free State.  Everything was new for him.  The diseases etcetera and the feeding circumstances.    Well it was clear to me that the vet was not used to the circumstances in the Free State comparing to that in India because in India you have a tropical climate which is much different from the dry nearly arid climate in the Free State.  So should different - be - be different.    That is correct.   It lasted for about two hours.    No Chair.  That is totally impossible.  Just to mention one example.  To AI - to - to do an AI Course on - on an animal will take you about a week and to …    And to …  Artificial insemination.    And to learn about feeding the right stuff to cows is about a three year university degree.  So in two hours you cannot become a professional and just walking through a farm but it will give you an idea.    Well the - the delegation left but about a month later I was contacted by Mr Ashok Narayan …    And he asked me to come to Johannesburg.  They want to speak further to him - to give him further advice and consulting them in erecting dairy project at Vrede.    That is correct.    That is correct.    By phone.   He told me that they want to continue with the project but they need some expert advice in planning the whole project.    Well I was under the impression that he spoke for the Estina Group.    Yes.  He gave me an address in Saxonwold where I should meet him at 9 o’ clock that morning.    Yes.  He told me that my employer Mr Neuman would also be attending.    Ja.  That is correct.    Chair as I - I understood it - understood it, it was about the largeness of the project.  I mean R1 billion to be spent on a dairy project is enormous and I thinkthey themselves become afraid of the enormity of the project and they - they - that is why it was so urgent.    No that was my - what I …    Afleiding.    Ja.  That is right.   That is correct.    Yes.  They gave me a street address.  I cannot remember the address anymore.    Well me - I - I reported it to my employer that they invited me to go there and he said to me that he wanted to go with me …    And we discussedthe project between us and we thought ah.  Here as a - as the boere says.  When it rains pap you must skep.  That is the …    As the boere said - it is a saying.  When it rains pap you must skep.    We realised the enormity of this project and thought ah now we can sell our cows at a - at a huge price.    Ja.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well that was abouta week.    No.  I was not aware whether it was either of them but when I arrived there I saw that it was the residential property.    Well I never in mylife have seen such security - security at the gate as well in the parking area.  When I stopped, there was three guards escorting me to the house.    Yes.  They took me straight to Mr Ashok Narayan.    That is correct Chair.    No.  We - we went separately Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    No.    Well we were not informed but I - at that stage I thought it would a property of Estina …    Because that is the only name whichever was mentioned to me.    Ja.  Of which property it was.  No, I was not …    No Chair.    No.    Estina’s.    Ja.    Well he arrived about an hour later.   Well we tried to identify the - the purpose of the meeting and/or the agenda and we - because we cannot give advice if we do not how - know how the things sticking into each other and then Mr Ashok Narayan told us that he was sort of mediator between Estina, the Vrede Municipality and the Department of Agriculture of the Free State and that he pertinently told us that Mr Ace Magashule was involved and that was a key project for him to be pushed through …  And it should succeed.    Yes.   Well he was very serious about the whole project and I - I could see that he was nervous Chair.  That he should succeed.    No.  He was just a -just a representative your honour.    Yes.    But a mediator between the three major role players in this project.    That is correct Chair.    Well Chair I came under the impression that Mr Narayan was very nervous every time we talk about Mr Ace Magashule and he was not able to put all the cards on the table.  He kept them close to his breast.  So - and that - that makes us a bit suspicious about the whole project.    The purpose was from me and my employer’s side to advice and consult - be consultants for the project.  To get off the ground and to be implementedsuccessfully.    Yes.  He - Mr Ashok referred me at the end of this meeting to the vet.  That vet from India which name I cannot recall now and a student - a young student which came with him.    Pardon.     Ja.     That’s correct.     That is correct Chair.     That’s correct.     As I understood it at the time they wanted to appoint him as manager of the whole project.     Yes, they didn’t tell me but I could see at that stage he had no experience of dairy of that – so big a dairy, he wasn’t experienced, he did not have enough experience to manage such a big project.     Not specifically but in our discussions it came out that he knows nothing.     And the vet yes Chair.     That is correct yes.     Well our conversation with Mr Ashok Narayan was about three hours, from nine to twelve.     Yes, as I told you before we tried to sell our, we saw the opportunity to sell our cattle at a good price, and he told us no they are not interested.     That’s correct.     No that was a different meeting.     At the sameproperty.     On the same day, the meeting with Mr Narayan was in the dining room, the meeting with the vet was on the stoep.     Ja, they told us they want to milk a thousand cows, so they asked me whatinfrastructure they should need to milk a thousand cows, what the feed, how much feed they need, how the follow-flow should look and how – what diseases are in the area, which they should be aware of.     Well twice a day a thousand.     A thousand cows milked twice a day.     Ja, sometimes youcan go to three times milking but then it’s – that is very hard work.     Ja, Chair a cow is producing milk continuously, every minute she is producing milk, but if you add another milking there is more space in the udder and then she can produce more milk, there’s space to produce more milk, but when the udder is full she produces less.     Well we realised that is quite a big operation because a normal dairy in the Vrede area is about 80 cows big.  So that – this was an enormous dairy to be erected.     Ja, I told them the biggest problem was to produce enough feed for the cows and to buy in as little as possible because a dairy cow needs very refined food, either pastures or lucern or alfalfa which should be bought in, and the Vrede area the only thing growing there is mealies and grass, so I questioned their decision to establish the dairy in the Vrede area, because most of the Free State farmers or a lot of them have alreadymoved down to the Coast, the Southern Cape or Natal where to produce milk is much cheaper, so there was a question raised by my why in Vrede.  That was according to me I think it was a stupid decision to produce milk in the most difficult area in the country, for such a big project.     Well they werequite surprised when I told them about the climate, they didn’t expect it, because they were used to India’s plenty of rain there, and not the harsh winters we have here in the Free State, so I thought there awaited a surprise for them, and I think they realised that.     Sorry I don’t understand your question?     Well as I understood it they were involved in Estina’s projects in India.     Well after I toldthem about the diseases in the area we covered about everything in the management of the dairy and they were satisfied and we concluded it.     Well I realised they were in for a big surprise.     And I was proved right because a lot of their animals died after they bought in, about sixmonths after they bought in quite expensive animals and good animals they start dying due to diseases they did not understand.     No that was the only people.     Yes but as agreed with Mr Ashok he paid me for consulting fees as well as for my travelling fees.     When he firstphoned me to tell me that they need me for consulting I told him, then we agreed around the amount.     Yes that is correct Chair.     No he didn’t tell me that.     Ja, that’s correct.     That is correct.     No he joined in from the beginning of the meeting.    That’s correct.     No.     No Chair.     Well we startedhaving tea ...[intervenes]      That’s right, the serious meeting starts when my employer arrived.     Ja, that is correct.     That is correct.     At that meeting where me and my employer was, attended, Mr Ashok Narayan told usbecause we asked him where will the money come from for this project, but what was the sense in discussing it if there is no money available and he confirmed to us that Estina will put down 300million and 700million will come from the Government for the project.     Ja Chair one billion rand is a lot of money and at that time around 2012 a lot of dairy farmers went out of production because it was no more profitable andto put down a dairy and starting off a dairy was to an amount of R30million about more or less, so we could not understand why, what the motive of Estina was and the whole Group, was it to produce milk, to get milk, or was it to put emerging farmers on the ground.If it was to produce milk this was the wrong option, and too expensive, they rather could fund existing dairy farmers, commercial farmers to get the milk if that was their motive.  So I don’t think they were quite sure of their own motives.     That is correct.     Well at that time the going price of dairy cattle was about R8 000 depending on the quality but we thought we could go up – maybe we could get R12 000 a cow.     Ja, because at that stage we thought that was a good price.     That is correct but we aimed for a bit more.     Ja.     That’s correct.     Chair we see another possibility of making a few rands, and knowing what expensivemachinery they needed at the project we told the ...[indistinct] or the agents of the people who is putting in the machines, the suppliers of the machines and the storage tanks that there is an opportunity they can get business and they were so thankful they told us they will give us one percent of the pressure cost for putting in the machinery, and that was about R6million and me and Mr Newman received each R30 000, that was R60 000.     That’s correctChair.     Well Chair our recommendation was to put in a 30  point rotary milking machine to milk that amount of cows and the storage a thousand cows should give you about 30 000 litres of milk per day so you need storage capacity of about 60 000 litres and that was what we recommended.     The machine cost about – well all the equipment cost about R6million.     Yes, that would be the fair market value.    That’s correct.     From the supplier of the equipment.     Ja, that’s correct.     Ja, that’s correct.     Ja that is correct.     Can you repeat your question please?     Oh, paragraph 19.  Chair again I see an opportunity in my career to be part of this big project and maybe become manager, I have identified an opportunity, so I went to Mr Prassad, he was the office manager in Vrede and told him that I was willing to help them in managing the project.  At thatstage it was the stage when the cattle started dying on the farm and I felt that my services would be appreciated there, and that they did not manage.  So I was honest in offering my services to them, but they were very sensitive at that stage of the cattle dying, so they chased me away.     No, from Mr Narayan?     Well I phoned him about managing, helping them managing the project and he was very sensitive and he referred me to Mr Prassad.       Well I get the impression that he was not in control and he referred it to Mr Prassad.     That is correct.     Ja.     No he just closed the door in my face.  He was very harsh to me.     That is correct.     No, I did not do anything else?     That is correct.     Chair in Vrede it was general knowledge, or as they say down the grapevine you get the information, down the grapevine that Mr Motaung received a brand new black 450 Mercedes ML for his part, his role-playing to arrange the Krynaauwslust Farm on a 99 year lease for Estina but I have never seen the car, and nobody told me it firsthand, that was common knowledge in the discussions there in town.    No, no.     Pardon?     Ja.     That is correct.     Well my knowledge is that the project people become desperate to get the land the farm Krynaauwslust to initiate the dairy project.     Well it was Estina, all the role-players, and they put a lot of pressure on Mr Motaung as Mayor of Vrede to get rid of the Newmans from the – to get them out of the contract, the lease contract.    Yes, yes, I personally attended the meetings between Mr Newman and Mr Motaung.     In Mr Newman’s house, in his office.     I attended itpersonally.     Well actually he begged him to be kind and for the sake of the project to get rid of the contract.     Yes Chair.     There was about three meetings.     At the three meetings it was all basically the same, to get rid of the lease contract.     Well actually I do not understand your question.     Well my employer was sympathetic against the project and he said well he will let go hiscontract and cancelled the contract.     No he did not insist on any compensation.     No, no.     That was just a gesture of goodwill.     No I think this was like tapping  blood out of a stone, there is nothing else I can mention.     Well Chair lots of farmers stopped their dairy operations in the Free State, from Heilbron right through Vrede, Harrismith, Bethlehem, Ficksburg because it wasnot paying anymore.  It was too expensive to produce food for the cattle here, and the milk price as too low.  The ratio from milk price and food price was not right, so they are moving down to the coastal areas, Natal and Southern Cape, Tsitsikamma and there they survive and making huge successes, so that was making me raising my eyebrows.       The price ratio.     In balance.    No, no.     That is right.     No Chair, the idea of processing your own product to add value to your own product that is a very good idea.  If that succeed then the project could be successful.  The cost of transportation, the argument of transportation is not for me a good argument, but ...[intervenes]      The argument from Mr Thabethe that the transportation cost is the main problem is not correct because these days people transport milk from Cape Town up to Johannesburg, from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg, that is not really aproblem, but where Government could have played a role was in creating a market for that value added products, that would solve the problem.     Well as I see it with Government contracts ...[intervenes]      That is correct, Government institutions could buy the milk.    Schools, School Feeding Schemes.     Could be a solution.     Ja.     Ja, because our people needs protein, especially our children and Government could take initiative there and produce people with good food.     That is correct Chair.     No half of it were in Natal, Northern Natal, and the other half was in the Free State.     Yes.     That is correct.    That is correct sir.     That is correct Chair.     Yes.  I have done agricultural economics as one of my subjects.     Ja.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair. 
ADV REFILOE MOLEE:  Mr Theron when the statement was drafted was it read to you? 
ADV LEACH GCABASHE SC:   It does Chairman.     Certainly Chair.
