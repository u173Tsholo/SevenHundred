CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Yes.  Yesterday I hear argument on the recusal application and I indicated that I was hoping to give judgment this morning.  I am not going to give a ruling or judgment this morning because I must – I am still working on it.  I have got quite some documentation to go through carefully.  I am going to use today to work on that judgment.   So we are going to adjourn and resume tomorrow at ten by which time I hope to be ready to deliver my ruling/judgment on the recusal application.  So we are going to adjourn and then we must resume tomorrow at ten.  If for some reason I am not ready at ten o’clock communication will be sent to all concerned.   It might be eleven or twelve but I am going to aim for ten o’clock tomorrow. Okay. I have already communicated this to counsel on both sides so they are aware of it.  Okay alright.      Thank you.    I think Mr Sikhakhane would like to say something.  Somebody must just sanitise first.      Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay and then he would be – depending on the outcome tomorrow he would be back on Thursday?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    No, no, no that is fine.  Well he may attend the funeral tomorrow and on the understanding that if on Thursday he is required to be here he will be back.    Okay alright.    We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Chair thank you, thank you.     We – I have indicated yesterday that we were to look at the statement that you read.    In which I in jest said you have made yourself a witness.     We have consulted briefly with client and our instructions are to put on record a statement that deals with your statement.    And may or may not put in dispute some of the things you have stated so I thought     It is convenient that it will happen – the judgment will happen to – the ruling will happen tomorrow which we hope we shall have given you the version of the relationship of yours with the former President.    Secondly he requests that he has an emergency and if he – with the leave of the Chairperson he is not here tomorrow it is not any disrespect he would like me to ask the Chair to excuse him – he has a funeral to attend – something has just happened he has to go there and be...[intervenes]    Chair.    Depending on the outcome tomorrow so we will have – we will communicate     The situation because he is going there for a funeral.  I do not know whether the funeral – it cannot be during the week.    But a death has happened in the family and so…    But he is going to – whatever the Chair     Tells us to do but we will also try and give the Chair the version of the relationship the two of you had from his perspective.  And Chair may I say right here because it is because there may be things that he may have thought are not relevant.    But he will place them in – on record.    He needs to put his own version.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair I will communicate that with him.    Thank you Chair.
