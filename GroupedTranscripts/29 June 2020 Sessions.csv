CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Soni, good morning everybody.  Before we start I would like us to all rise and I observe a moment of silence in remembrance of all those who have passed on as a result of Covid-19 in this country and elsewhere in the world but also to honour the doctors, nurses and other health workers who are in the front line in the fight against the pandemic.  Thank you.   Good morning Mr Molefe thank you very much for coming back to the commission to continue with your evidence.  We appreciate your commitment to helping the commission.  I think you are coming to the commission probably for the sixth time.  We really appreciate it, we understand that it might mean some inconvenience in terms of your other work but we appreciate that you continue to show your commitment to supporting the commission.      Thank you very much.  You may be seated Mr Molefe.  Oh, I think there – there will need to be the swearing – the oath first because it has been a long time but before that I do not know Mr Soni might wish to say something.  I have been advised that it is acceptable that whenever I speak or you speak Mr Soni as well as the witness, we take off the mask and then we put it back when we are not speaking.  Of course, we intend observing the social distance but I do not think there is enough space between Zwelihle here.  Just one chair in between I do not think is enough.  I think you need to move further – further up otherwise I am looking around I think there is – otherwise enough social distancing.  Thank you very much.  Mr Soni.    Please put on your microphone.    Okay alright then we can do the oath.  Thank you.    Thank you very much.  Yes Mr Soni.      You might need to just re-orientate everybody where we left off.    With Mr Molefe’s evidence    In the past and where we are continuing there.    Just one second.  The air conditioner seems to be on it does not feel like it is a heater it is like it is making us cold so I think somebody will attend to that.  Okay.    Let us just indicate…    Which number that file is?    And what page?    And that would be the same file that Mr Molefe has got in front of him, is that right?    Okay.  Page 222 that is where they start.    Yes.  But the instance when I was looking at this file they did not seem to be arranged according to dates.    The article (intervenes).    Why not?  I thought that they would go front the earliest up to – when you read – when you try to follow the story.    Hm.  I had to try and see which one is supposed to – you see for example at page 222 you have got an article of 7 August 2015 and at page 238 you have got an article of 6 July 2015.  I mean that is 26 and then at page 243 you have got an article of 23 July 2015.    They should have been arranged according to dates. ADV SONI    Yes.  So that one could see the build-up.  This is how the reporting started.    And how it – how it built up.    Up to the date of the meeting.    In terms of what everyone must have been seeing in the – in the media.    Hm.    I do not know whether it can be changed?    Yes.    Hm.    Okay the only – the only problem of course is that when you refer to the articles now if you mention the page numbers and the page numbers are going to change.    It will be problem with the transcript.  But it may be that – it may be that later on when the – when this has been changed arrangements can be made for you to place on record what the latest number – page numbers will be.  Okay, alright.    Hm.  Okay.  It is quite dark where I am.  I do not know whether there is anything that can be done about it.  I know that last time there was that same issue but we will continue in the meantime.    Hm.  Just one second.  It may well be if that – if there are problems in getting – need to have better lighting here it may well be that a gas light might help so that when I want to read I can see the words.    Clearly.  So – ja, okay alright.    Well apart from any incompatibility I think for me what is most important is the fact that the question whether the articles which were in the media made it reasonable for us to – to make it reasonable for us to expect that people who normally read what is in the media would have been aware that at PRASA there are all these very serious allegations of corruption.    That was alleged to have been taking place so that whatever proposals or decisions people were making they were making them being aware of all of these things.    Ja.    Okay.    I think that it would help me a great deal if Mr Molefe is able and your questioning can be directed that he is able to say based on what I told the Top 6 anyone who was in that meeting would have known the following features of corruption at PRASA because I told them.    1, 2, 3, 4 at least some of the important ones.    It may be that it is something that he might be able to do without going back to refresh his memory.    It may be that it is something that he would prefer to refresh his memory before mention – saying it.    So if we do not deal with it now because he might not have – he might need to refresh his memory we can deal with it later when he has a time – he has had a chance to refresh his memory.    But I would like – I would like that – that kind of evidence that makes it quite clear that here are some of the features of corruption or allegations of corruption at PRASA that anyone who was at that meeting was told about.    Exactly.    Yes.    Yes, no that is fine. Mr Molefe you have heard the exchange between the Chairperson and myself and you understand the – the issue that rises because the whole question is should something have been done other than calling a meeting on the 20t h to say take Mr Montana back?  But I – do you want to go through the articles or do you know them sufficiently?    Oh.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Maybe before you – before you leave the report, I must just say I know that Mr Soni is very happy to hear that the report has been found.  I am very happy that it has been found.  I have been very concerned about whether we will ever find it.    They will make arrangements to make IT people available to you because obviously we also want to have the report.  You want us to have the report so if – if you – if the commission can assist with IT people that they will be made available to you and then we should have it.    Yes.    Well I was actually thinking as you were telling me that – as you were telling me that the report was addressed to him then it occurred to me that then we could ask him if he has – if he still has it.    But of course, if you can find it let – that will enable us to have it quicker but the former Minister may have to – to assist with issues relating to some of the matters that have come here.    Yes – no, no I am – I am confident that he – he will make himself available.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Just one second.  Just one second Mr Molefe I want to understand that part.  Are you saying that at the meeting Mr Montana indicated that he had sent the report to the Minister?    Oh no.    And my recollection is that in your evidence last time you actually said the President also said Mr Montana is the best guy to do this job.     No, thank you, Mr Molefe, why what was known in the public domain and what you told the top six at that meeting is important is because the top six are the top leaders of the governing party and most of them would have been in government as well and for me, the question arises, if they are told by the Chairperson of a board of an government entity such as PRASA that there is a lot of corruption that we see has been happening, or that we think has been happening, and we are taking steps to investigate, I want to know what they did after that about what you told them.   I want to know what they did, not from you because you told me already that they never came back to you for anything, but I want to know when they come here, I want to know what they did about that.   We are all aware of what is in the public domain about PRASA, even now.  We are all aware about what is in the public domain about other SOEs about which there have been a lot of evidence of corruption in this Commission, SAA, Eskom, Denel and it would appear that these things do not start just now, these things seem to have started a long time ago and it is only proper that this Commission should ask the question to some of those people, where were you, what did you do about this?  Did you not have a responsibility to do something?  So that is why it is important to me to know, apart from what was in the media.   We have the advantage that you had a meeting with the top six and you told that you alerted them and are there no steps that they ought to have taken, maybe which would have made sure that PRASA is not where it is today in terms of its financial position and that is part of accountability and part of what we have to look at.   I mean, you were here last time when we touched on the issue of parliamentary oversight.  I asked the same questions about parliament.   Where was parliament when all of these things – all of this corruption appears to have been happening all these years, what were they doing about it?   They have a right to call the President and say what is going on under your government?  What is going on with your minister so and so who is not doing his or her job?   They can call the minister, they can call the DGs, they can follow up, they can put that alliance and say if you do not fix this by such and such a time, we will pass a vote of no confidence in the whole cabinet.     Yes.  Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     You wrote, yes, yes, yes.     Ja.     No, no, certainly that is a very important part.     Ja, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No, no, we will do that and I will leave it to counsel to see where the right time is.  It might be at the end when you have all the evidence to then raise the issue.   I have said publicly that I have spoken to the Speaker of Parliament and the Chairperson of the NCOP and said that I think that parliament may need to start working on the issue of how it has carried out its oversight functions over the past x number of years and be able to come before the Commission at some stage and indicate what is revealed by an exercise of checking.   And, in particular. I am looking at the SOEs, specific SOEs about which we have heard a lot of evidence here but also certain government departments and other functionaries to say what did they do?  Did they do their job properly because it may well be that if they had done their job the way it should be done, maybe certain things might not have happened. But it may well be that they are able to come here and say look, these are our limitations in terms of mechanisms that are available to us and these are our limitations in terms of resources, we went as far as we could.   If we are in the future going to be expected to do more, certain changes must be made to enable us to do that, then that is fine but I do not think that this Commission can be said to have properly finished its job without hearing what parliament did.  Thank you.     You must tell him when you say CC, you mean Constitutional Court. ADV SONI     Yes, I just want to – I know you are looking both at me and counsel whereas you answer – remember to look more at me than him.  Yes, thank you.     Just to refresh my memory, this report, you had – did you have a – had you seen the report at the time of the meeting yourself?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     It was not official.     Yes, okay, okay.     But it existed long before the meeting, that is the point you can make?     Ja, yes.     Okay, okay, thank you.  And it was addressed to Minister Radebe?     Ja, okay.     Okay.     She asked for it.     Ja, okay.     Okay, thank you.     I am sorry, Mr Soni, I may have I misunderstood you but I thought your plan was to take Mr Molefe to the media articles briefly before you go to the meetings to highlight all the certain features.     Or do you think that – I think it is important, he may have mentioned some of the things but it is important like maybe to simply highlight some of the features in the articles before we go to the meeting or is your plan to …[intervenes]     Oh, okay, that is fine, that is fine, that is fine.     No, it is fine, we can do it later, ja.     What paragraph?     Yes thank you.     And insofar as you are asked what the reasons were, Mr Molefe, you must feel free to indicate what reasons were given by the Minister for her decision and to say what, on your analysis of the situation, the reasons were, whether you agree that those were the reasons or you say the reasons were different for this and that that reason.  So I just alert you that even though the question is put like that, there may be a difference – you might have a different view about what the reasons were to the reasons that were given by the Minister.     But I think – I am sorry, Mr Molefe.  If, as you give your evidence or as you answer any question, there is an aspect of connecting the dots that you think is appropriate to do there and then, feel free to do it, not wait until later but later on we can wrap up.     But – so if it is convenient, connect the dots as you go along.     Before you proceed, Mr Molefe, you said, I think, the board had conducted interviews and had identified a person that they believed could be Group CEO and had made a recommendation to the Minister, is that correct?       It may help, but you – if there are reasons – maybe there are reasons you might be reluctant, might have to look that, it may help if we know who was recommended.  I say that because I have had evidence in regard to other SOEs where a board recommended a candidate for the position of Group CEO and the board – and the Minister at the time gave evidence here and said she was in support of that candidate but she said the former President made it clear to her that he wanted a certain person and no one else to take that position. Of course, the former President has denied saying that and that will be dealt with later on.  He must still come to give further evidence.   So I am – and I have, in regard to that matter, I asked whether this was a credible candidate and whether the former President, if he was not keen to have this person appointed, whether he questioned the qualifications or experience of that candidate and I was told by the Minister – or gave that evidence that no, there was no questioning of the qualifications or experience of the candidate that was proposed. So it becomes important – it may become important to say here is a candidate that was recommended, he is a credible candidate, has got all the qualifications, has got all the experience, what was the problem with going with that candidate?   So I mention that because it might be helpful but if you have some reasons that make you reluctant to disclose, that is fine.     Let us just get the spelling, Lauriette and the surname?     Okay.     Okay.     Yes, yes, okay.     In what capacity?     CEO, ja.     Okay.     Yes.     Ja.  So she had worked in a position that is very much the CEO’s position under PRASA.     Yes.     Well, uh, please uh, I want to... to see all of those letters you are talking about.  So I want all of that evidence uh, because you... you are asking that the... the minister delayed for a long time uh, to have a decision made, I guess, on your recommendation at the board. And uh, at a certain stage, she told you what you said.  She told you um, in the regard the matter that was talking about. Uh, I mean, it is in the public domain.  Evidence was given here.  It is uh, the feeling of the position of Group CEO for Transnet after the departure of Ms Ramos. Uh,... uh,... uh,... Ms Barbara Hogan gave evidence to the fact that the Transnet Board at the time recommended uh, mister, I think, Sipho Maseko uh, for the position and the board was of the opinion that uh, Mr Siyabonga Gama was uh, uh, not suitable for the position if he was a candidate. Um, and in any event uh, there were some allegations of misconduct that they thought was aware of them, but I... I think the evidence was, the board said, “we just took him into account whether he was suitable”.  You know, “we have left out of the account”.  Even the allegations.     If I must now give evidence to that effect.     Oh, you were here?     Yes.  So... so that... that position was not filled for over a year uh,... um,... and uh,... so I am wondering whether now, the delays you are talking about after your board had made a recommendation as to who should fill the position of group... group CEO, reflects a pattern that may have been happening with um, the appointment of Group CEO for some of the SOE’s. So I want... I would like all of that evidence, all of those letters.  If you are able to get that, we would like them here.     Thank you.     Well, I am sorry Mr Soni.     Um, the connecting of the dots is... is quite important.  I mean, of course, anybody can come later and say, “no, this committing of the dots that you are talking about is not proper because of the following evidence that you have not add, Mr Chairperson”. That uh, with regard to the group CEO for Transnet, there was that delay uh, for the filling of the position of Gross CEO and the candidate who had been recommended by the board had to uh, make his other plans because he was kept waiting for too long. And then Mr Gama was dismissed after a disciplinary process uh, in uh, at the end of June 2010.  The position had become vacant, I think early in 2009 if I am not mistaken.  So already by mid-June... by mid-year 2010, there... there was um, still the position, it was not filled.     Then the Minister Barbara Hogan was dismissed from cabinet at the end of October.  Uh, another minister was appointed and then the evidence will come later upon and then Mr Gama was reinstated uh, in February uh, or uh, March/April 2011 to become... to go back to his position as uh, CEO of GFR. And then when... when Brian Molefe left for Eskom, then Gama was made Group CEO of Eskom, the position that uh, was in contest when he was dismissed.   So... so I just want to paint that picture because I want to see whether uh, under PRASA, there are crucial things to go along the same lines or not.     For how long?     Since Montana has left?     Five years?!     H’m?     H’m.     H’m.  Well, uh, as I... as I understand it even up to now, it seems there is not been a Group CEO appointed.  Is that right?  Since Montana left?     And how many years would be... that position would have been ...[intervenes]      About five years.     2015.     Ja, so that is... that is... that is... ja, that is about five years.  Ja, that is five years.     And that cannot be for a lack of properly qualified candidates?     Ja?     I am sorry.  Uh, I think uh, the witness would like some water.  Water should have been put uh, placed uh, before him.     Uh, actually, we are at quarter past eleven.  Maybe we should take a tea-break.     Ja and then, when we come back, just make sure there is water for the... for the witness.  I see also, I have no water here.  So the...      I think maybe the people concerned thought we do not need water in winter.      It is too cold. [laughs].  Uh, let... let us adjourn uh, for the tea-break.  It is quarter past eleven.  We will resume at half-past eleven.  We adjourn.     Uh, yes Mr Soni.  I... I asked that if possible, somebody should try and uh, make sure that it is warmer here.     Because it was quite cold.     Uh, I have asked them to bring me a small heater next to me but um... uh, I have asked that if there is a way of making it warm in the whole room...[intervenes]      ...they should try and do that.  Okay.     Thank you.       Yes.     So there was a specific reference um, uh, in the context of Prodigy uh, to somebody saying, “the young man is coming back”.  Is that right?     Yes and that was twenty...     Seven...     Yes.  Okay, okay.     Oh.  Oh, okay yes.  So there is... there is a... so Mr Moodley said, “changes were on the way”.     “And you better make sure that when those changes happen, you are on the right side”.     “And the young man is coming back”.     And uh, you said not long after that, the minister was uh, was dismissed.     Yes and how long after that did your board get uh-uh, dismissed or dispended?       How long after... after did... did the Mr Molefe’s board get dispended?      Or that much longer ... much later on?     Okay.  That is 2017?     And uh, this meeting that Mr Holele talked about with Mr Moodley was when?     So soon after Mr Holele had heard Mr Moodley, Roy Moodley, saying, “changes were about to happen”, the minister was fired uh, or before the minister was fired, she fired the board and then she was fired.     Okay.  All right.     Yes.  Okay, okay.  All right.  And of course, Mr Molefe, you can confirm any of this insofar as you may know it yourself what... what... what has been a change or the exchange?     Well, you certainly... you certainly uh, have to just that the minister dispended you... announced the disbandment of your board in parliament. Your recollection would be that what... what month of 2017 was that?     2017?     Okay.  And um... and you recall uh, how soon... how much later after that she was dismissed as... or not really?     The same month?     Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.     She... she [laughs] Just repeat that. [laughs]     Just repeat that.       She may have been perceived... she was too late?     Ja.     Ja, on the board.     Ja.  Okay.  Thank you.     Thank you Mr Soni.  I understand that the heater will make it warm in due course, it might take a little bit, for sometime in the whole room so that is good news and I am hoping that the electricity people will make sure that we don’t have these interruptions that we have been having.  Okay let’s continue.  Your mic?     And actually, your evidence was that you got a report that one of your projectors had seen them in the premises.     Thank you.     I just want to make sure, I don’t lose track of where we are.  At some stage before the break you had asked Mr Molefe to deal with the reasons of the dismissals, disbandment of the Board and I highlighted to him that, in doing so, he might wish to tell me what the Minister – what reasons the Minister gave and what reasons, he believes, are the true reasons if he is not in agreement with the reasons given by the Minister.  So, you might be playing to it later, I just want to make sure you have not …[intervenes].    Yes, oh okay, thank you.     For the record, just repeat what file you are still on Mr Soni.     What’s the page number again?     1-5-4?    Yes, you can read that paragraph because it is important, at the end of page 154, “I therefore ask that you close off”, It’s the last paragraph on page 154.     At the end.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, I think that – oh if you feel there is something important…[intervenes].     And just to confirm, you were reading from a letter from the Minister of Transport at the time Ms Dipuo Peters addressed to you, Dr Popo Molefe, Chairperson of PRASA and it’s a letter that she signed on the 12 t h of August 2016, ja, thank you.     Yes you can read.     But before you do that, I think, your reference in your letter at page 158 to Section 51(1) is also important, do you want to just read that part, A and B?  Where you say, “Section 51(1) provides for the following general responsibilities of the Board”. Do you want to just read that part?     On the last page 160.     Well maybe it’s important to highlight the next sentence at page 160, the next sentence after the sentence that deals with what you’ve just said Mr Molefe, namely, that people who had gained money from PRASA unlawfully were using that money to fight PRASA in the Courts.  You then say – this is at page 160, “An example of this is the guarantee, you put guarantee in quotes, that obliges PRASA to pay almost R800million to Siyagena.  As we have previously advised the Minister, this document was not known by any PRASA official. We are still awaiting the reply to the letter addressed to your office in this regard.  Siyagena have now instituted legal proceedings against PRASA claiming payment of an amount of approximately R1.1billion related to this very guarantee, in quotes”.     There was a change, ja thank you.     I know that – I have heard evidence, I can’t remember whether from you or from Ms Martha Ngoyi, I’ve heard evidence of a document that PRASA officials were looking for, or rather were looking for and they couldn’t find which had been signed, I think, by Mr Montana, apparently without any knowledge of any PRASA official, do you know whether the document you are talking about which Siyagena produced when they took you to Court is that document or you are not sure which – because you have said that PRASA officials seemed not to know about that document until then?  Would you know whether that’s the same document or you might not know?     Ja, thank you.     You spoke away from the mic, so that won’t be reflected on the transcript, ja, just start again.     Okay, thank you.     Of that letter.     Of that page 163, do you want to read that paragraph into the record?   Now, that too, for the sake of completeness – so you had made a recommendation to the Minister of a candidate for appointment as group CEO and what you are saying in this paragraph, is that the Minister ’s response was that PRASA was not ready for the appointment of a group CEO.    A very long time, yes, yes.     Yes, yes, so it’s sounds a very strange response to me, did she clarify why she thought PRASA was not ready for a permanent group CEO, I would have thought that any organisation needs a leader, a permanent leader like, yesterday.  I don’t understand the idea of an organisation not being ready for a permanent leader.      So that seems to suggest…    Interactions.    Ja okay thank you.    Oh you want to show the witness the document?    Ja, ja show the witness.    In the meantime ja.    Ja.      Ja they will bring it to you Mr Molefe.  They will bring it to you.      I am sorry your microphone is off.  You just switched off.    Oh.    Yes.  Yes.  Okay no, at least now we know it is…    Yes, no we must not lose it.  I think what Mr Soni has in mind is that once you have confirmed as you have that it is the document they can immediately start running – printing it and securing it to make sure that we do not lose it and making sure they can give you a copy if you need a copy or you might have your – a copy.  And then – and then Mr Soni you can then see whether you would let Mr Molefe deal with the document later or when?    Ja. Ja.    Ja because you might need to read it as well.    First ja.  But at least now that we have got it I think that is very important.  Ja.    Ja thank you, thank you.    Remember to look this side.  Yes as you did previously.    Is that part you would like read in the letter?    Ja please read it.    Yes page 164.    Yes read it.    Hm.    Ja if that was the important part that is fine but if there is another important part you can indicate.    Our Counsel will indicate if there is another part he wants you to look at.    You are disobeying the full [indistinct    Yes.    Yes.    I am sorry I did not hear you Mr Soni just raise your voice.    Yes please drink – you may drink water so that we can proceed so there is no problems because advisably adjourn each time.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm. MR    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Well I – in keeping with what you said and what you have just said I think it is important to look at the last part of page 165 of your letter.  You say    Okay thank you.    Hm.    Maybe just before you answer Mr Molefe just to make sure we get everything in proper sequence.  I think you said earlier on the Board was dissolved by the Minister on the 8 March 2017, is that correct?    And did the dissolution take place by way of the Minister making an announcement in Parliament?    Yes.    Yes. MR    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Now so…    So it is not the Minister who made the announcement in Parliament it is the DG?    But reading a letter from the Minister?    And the DG was reading that letter to the Depart – to the Portfolio Committee of Transport?    Now before the – this letter was read in – in – before the Portfolio Committee had you already been alerted by the Minister that the Board – your Board was going to be dissolved?    Ja.  Yes.    Yes.  Okay.  So – and did you get to know about it for the first time when maybe the media report heard about what was happening in the Portfolio Committee before you got the official letter from the Minister or did you get the Minister – the letter – Minister’s letter first then you heard that it had – the letter had been read in Parliament?    Yes.    That seems a very strange way of – of – one would have thought that the Board would be informed first or at least to be alerted.  So – so unless the letter had been sent first to try and achieve that but because you might not have been alerted that there was a letter – an important letter – urgent letter that you should – were – expect in your emails then you only got to see it later.    Same day.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  I know that previously I asked you a question and I think you gave me an answer as to whether this particular Minister, Minister of Dipuo Peters whether if you look at her approach or attitude towards the Board when the Board started and later in the life of the Board whether her attitude towards the Board might have changed.  And I think if I recall correctly that – the impression I got was that you thought her attitudes towards the Board changed at a later stage.  Is that right?    Yes.  Yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.    Well I do not know whether Mr Soni was going to ask this question but I want to ask this question.  You have had time to reflect on the events that happened throughout your – the term of office of your Board at PRASA.  Are you able to say whether on your analysis of the events there was – that the dismissal of your Board happened on the day on which the Board was appearing before the Portfolio Committee was a mere coincidence or is there some significance in the convergence of the Board’s appearance before the Committee and the dismissal and I see you said the date the letters were signed on the 8 t h on the same day.  Is there a certain significance in these two things happening on the same day or the dismissal happening on the day when the Board is appearing before the Committee?  Or was it a coincidence or is it a matter you have not had time to reflect or you would prefer not to – to leave it to other people to analyse this?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.     Is there – to your knowledge was there anything that the Minister or anyone else might have expected that the board would say before the Portfolio Committee that the Minister or somebody else might not have wanted the board to get the chance to say because the moment you are dismissed I take it that the Portfolio Committee might say you have no – once you are no longer a board we do not – we have no business asking you any questions so you stop this appearance before the Portfolio Committee the moment you announce that the board is dismissed.  Do you know whether there was anything that the board may have been expected to say that somebody might not have wanted to board to say before the Portfolio Committee or you would not be sure?     Thank you.  I do not know how everyone feels, it does not feel – it feels like the aircon is – the heater is taking too long to make us warm.  I do not know but maybe when we come back after lunch it will be fine.  I think you wanted to ask question before we adjourn.     It does need to be looked at because it is quite extraordinary.     That the Minister who I assume would have known in advance that the board would be appearing before the Portfolio Committee on a certain date does not dismiss the board before that but actually dismisses the board on the day or when they are supposed to appear and I would imagine that if she dismissed the board before the date she would have achieved the same thing if part of her concern was that the board was going to reveal certain things.     But it may well be that coinciding the dismissal with the date of the board’s appearance before the Commissioner – before the Portfolio Committee, might have been based on some other reason.     And I think Mr Molefe has mentioned that also it might have been intended to embarrass the board and to get a lot of publicity for that.     Ja, so after lunch we can wrap that up.     Okay, I see it is two minutes past one.  Let us take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you.  And the way it is cold here in Jo’burg, it makes some of us who come from Durban want to go back to Durban.  Okay, let us continue.     Yes, is that the report which we have been calling the Turmoil at PRASA?     Well, it may be that it is convenient to call it that even if that is not the heading that appears because we – as long as there is mention of that in the body of this document.     But if you have seen the report, I have not – there is another word that we can use to call it, that is fine, so I am just saying that because Mr Molefe emphasised earlier that he had noticed that it is not what it is called.  So that somehow one may end up …[intervenes]     H’m?     Somewhere in the report, you mean not at the top?     Not at the beginning.     Ja, I think it is convenient to call it that.     We will know what document we are talking about when anybody refers to the PRASA in Turmoil report or document.     Okay, alright.       Ja, I think, Mr Soni, you have confused both me and Mr Molefe about what you wanted – about the reports.     You said you want him to hand it up but I suppose you wanted him to identity it but I think you left that in between.     Okay, I can take it from Mr Molefe.  Sorry, let me take it from Mr Molefe.  Mr Molefe, I am sorry.       Ja, give it to me.  Yes, so that is the     Okay, you want to – have you got – I am sure, Mr Molefe, you have got your own copy?     Yes.  Okay, do you want Mr Soni to let him identify it so that we can admit it?     Well, we do not have to write down on page 1 at the top PRASA in Turmoil, we can leave it as it is.     What I meant was, anybody who says the PRASA in Turmoil report, as long as we know which document it is.     That would be fine.     Do you want Mr Molefe to identify it first?     Ja, do you want me to take him through it – not through it but to identify it first?     Ja.     Yes and it has got 11 pages, right?     Ja, it is pages 1 to 11 so it is an 11 page report.     Ja, okay.  What do you propose we mark it as exhibit what, Mr Soni?     You want it to be inserted?  We could have it separate.  We could have it separate.     Because unless we add it at the back of…     As a separate document.     Ja, ja.  Okay, then we need to know what exhibit it will be.     Exhibit?     Well, should we not make it SS7 because when you say...     Ja, is there another one because when you say 6A it will give the impression that it comes before 6.     What is the last exhibit we have admitted?  Even March, there may be other documents that we admitted or otherwise we could use SS6A, as you say. ADV SONI     My difficulty is that we will refer it with – we will use and then later we change.     Well, this bundle D consists of Mr Molefe’s affidavit and annexures thereto, is it not?     Should we not – and there is no other bundle that has got annexures to his affidavit, it is only this one.     Then should we not put it at the back so that it becomes simply an annexure?     Well, it is not an annexure because the affidavit – well, the affidavit does, I think, refer to it although because it was not available it was not annexed.     But I think we can put it at the end and we – it will become in terms of pagination as a PSM331.     So I think let us do – what was the document before that?  What was the document before that?  Was it PM11?  PM12?  PM15?  Ja, it looks like the last document is PM15.     So if we – let us make it PM and annexure even though – because it is referred to in the affidavit, is it not?     It is just not given an annexure number.     So I think let us make it annexure PM16.     Would that be alright?     So let us mark it PM16 and then in terms of the pagination it will be PSM333 and I write SS6 before PSM.  Okay, alright.  So if you refer to it as PM16 or PRASA in Turmoil we will know which one you are talking about.     Okay, alright.  Thank you. PRASA IN TURMOIL DOCUMENT HANDED IN AS PM16     Yes, later.     Ja.     I am sorry, Mr Soni, it is more logical for us to deal with the reasons, if any, that were given by the minister for dismissing the board and what Mr Molefe thought of those reasons before we go to challenging, is it not?     I am sorry, yes, I did not hear, just repeat, Mr Molefe?     Yes, I was …[intervenes]     Yes.  No, that is what I would like Mr Soni to traverse first.  We must – because you have told us that the – you have told us that the acting DG read the letter of dismissal to the Portfolio Committee.  So we do need to see – to identify the letter, if it is here.  If it is not here then I must be told it is not here because maybe from it we will see the reasons.  Or if the reasons are not there, Mr Molefe can indicate whether at some stage or another prior to the challenge in court of the decision the Minister did give her reasons or was asked to give reasons and what was her response.  I think it is more natural if we cover that first.     Let us deal with it now even if it is in the judgment because when one is listening to the story the first thing when one is told that the Minister dismissed the board, the next thing you want to know is why.     So it is better to hear it now even if the reason the court deals with them later on.     Ja.  So, in other words, what I want to know, do we have the letter that was read to parliament where the Minister communicated the – or that was written to the board, to members of the board saying you are being dismissed and these are the reasons, if they were given, and then the reaction to those reasons, I would like to know what he thought of those reasons.  Probably did not think much of them, that is why they decided to go to court.     But that is the – I am looking at getting the story in a logical way.     Yes, ja.  The court later on – we can say what did the court say about those reasons, but that is later.     Okay and – so even in the court proceedings that ensued it was not part of those…?     It was not part of this.     Okay.  Mr Molefe, have you found that letter by any chance?  I think you are looking for it.     Oh, okay.     Okay.  The one read in parliament would have been addressed to the Portfolio Committee?     Of the dismissal.     Oh, okay.  But even if you do not find – if you can find the letter that was addressed to you, we can deal with it.  If you do not find it you can just tell me what your recollection is of what reasons it gave, if it gave any.     Yes, okay.     The letter.     Yes.     Oh, did …[intervenes]     What you can do, Mr Soni, of course, is to look at the reasons as were understood in court.     Ja.     Ja.  Okay, alright.  Let us proceed.  If the letter is not there, let us proceed and then we will see how the court deals with it.  It is just that it is – when you say somebody has been dismissed in circumstances that appear to be strange the first thing you want to know is, why was the person dismissed, what was the reaction, before you hear what happened in court later.     Yes, okay.  Let us go ahead.  If we find the letter later on we can come back to it but that is fine, let us go ahead.     You say it is bundle A?     Well, I do not have – oh, there it is.     What page?  That is bundle A of EXHIBIT SS1.     And what is the page?     Hang on one second?     You said page 83?     I think the people who were paginating here departed from the norm.  You know, these bundles, the numbers, the pagination is supposed to be sequential from page 1 up to the last page.     But I see that the first document goes up to page 59.  The next document starts from scratch.     On page 1, it starts the pagination afresh.  It should not be like that.  Okay, page 83?     So that is now – ja, will you just make sure that these things are checked beforehand because the numbering, the pagination, there must be consistency with everything.     Because when I see page 59, I think okay, I am only 20 pages away from 83 only to find that when I think I have reached the twentieth page it is not 83 and I still a long way because the pagination has started afresh.  Yes, okay, I have got the judgment.     Did you say paragraph 81?     Five one?     Okay, yes.     Yes, yes.  Yes, no, that is an important factor to remind that she was talking to the media.     And not to the board and to yourselves.  Yes, okay.     By the judge.     Yes.     Does anybody feel like it is warmer than before lunch?     It is slightly warmer, okay.  Mr Molefe?     Okay, alright.     So whatever reasons the Minister furnished to the court for the decision to remove your board were found to be wanting by the court.     Yes.  Yes.     In the meantime, while you are waiting for the outcome of the court application, there was an interim board that was um, uh, in operation or they waited because... for the outcome of the application without putting in place an interim board?     Yes.  Okay.     It had to go once you ...[intervenes]      ...while... while you waiting on the case, ja. MR     Yes.     Okay.  I can... did Mr Maswanganyi respond positively to your request for resignation?      He did not respond at all or he did respond but ...     H’m.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  The correspondence you are talking about, if we do not have it here, it will be important to have it.     Between yourself and ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Oh, it is here?  Oh, okay.     Okay.     I am sorry.  Are we going back to the other bundle 3 or are we staying with this one?     Ja.  Uh, you just announce if done. so that uh...[intervenes]      ...whoever reads the transcript will understand...[intervenes]      Then now we are dealing with a different bundle or exhibit.  Okay, what page?  We are now ...[intervenes]      We are going back to Bundle D which is...[intervenes]      Page...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      Yes, page 170.  Yes.     I am sorry mister...[intervenes]      ...Soni.  I was trying to look for the date to see... of the letter to see how soon after he was appointed, he sent this letter.     H’m.     What is your recollection Mr Molefe as to how soon after he had appointed, he sent the board this letter uh, PM10?     Or is that something you are not able to remember?     Uh, page 25.     You give... you gave the date of 5 June 2017.     In paragraph 99 ...[intervenes]      ...as a date when Minister Maswanganyi asked the board to show court why it should not be dissolved.     So then that... that... that is right there.  You confirm that that is the date?     Ja, okay.     H’m.     H’m.     What did he do?     He achieved the same result through different means.     What does he do?     So uh... ja.  Were there two vacancies or were there more than two vacancies?     There were four vacancies?     But you know to create a quorum you needed two... up two appointments?     And you... you are saying that those two appointments could be somebody of his department and somebody from National Treasury?     And then the board would be able to function properly?     Ja, okay.  And... but he...[intervenes]      He did not do it.     Did he respond in any way?     H’m?     H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.  H’m.     But of course uh, if he... I mean, once the board did not have enough directors or members to be quorate, that was an item matter on its own.  The filling of those positions was urgent because it meant the board could not sit, is it not?     And the ...[intervenes]      Yes.  So...[intervenes]      So... so... so one would have expected that he would have appreciated the urgency and would... and would have known that the cabinet itself would regard the matter as urgent if he says, “the board of PRASA cannot operate because it does not have enough members of the board.  I need at least appointed.  Here is my nominee.  Here is the nominee of the Minister of Finance”. There is no reason why the... the cabinet performing its duties the way it should, would not have regarded that as urgent now.     H’m.  Okay.     Sorry, what page?     Page?     25.     Okay.  Thank you.       I think he should read paragraph 100 in its entire context.     Yes, yes.  Read that paragraph Mr Molefe.   “When everything else failed, he attempted to weaken the board by ensuring that it did not have a quorum”     And that is the reference to the Minister Maswanganyi ...[intervenes]      That... that... the E is reference to Minister Maswanganyi?     Yes, continue.     H’m.     H’m.       Look this side again.     [laughs]  Look at me.  [laughs]     [laughs]     Yes.  Okay, you were advised by some of...[intervenes]      Yes.     That... that they have been approached and asked to resign.     H’m.       H’m.     Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.  Uh, are you able to tell... give us the names of the board members who resigned around that time?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     So the... were there two who resigned roundabout this time when you say it looked like there was an attempt to render the board dysfunctional?     And it is two that you have told me about?     Yes.     And there was one, I think one of them... did you say one of them told you that explicitly that he had been approached or she had been...[intervenes]      She.     Oh, but that one refused to resign?     Okay, okay.     Yes.     Ja.     H’m.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes, it is a serious problem.     There is no way we can... we can compare.     We can compare.  Because it is... it is very important that the Commission understands how it came about that in certain SOE’s, for example, corruption reached the kind of levels that we have heard about in the Commission.     How did that happen?  What was the method used by those people who sought to uh, engage in corruption?  Is it true that the sought to remove people who... who wanted to do the right things, who were not prepared to do wrong?   Is it true that they sought to remove them, make it difficult for them to do their jobs so that they could then bring people who would dance to their tunes?   If that is true, the Commission needs to hear that and people who have knowledge of these things, when they do not come forward to tell the Commission, it... it makes it difficult.   And it... what the Commission is doing is trying to see what caused these problems so that it can look at recommendations that it can make to say going forward, what measures should be in place to make sure that um, the country is a better country than uh, a country that is mired in corruption and state capture and so on.   So... so one wishes that there will be more people     Please raise your voice Mr Soni.     Your voice goes down and...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes.     Earlier?     H’m.       Ja, so the point you are making is, he still wants to dismiss the board at a time when... in a few weeks’ time, the term of the board will expire anyway?     Yes.     H’m.  H’m. MR     H’m.   MR     H’m.       Yes.     Yes.     H’m.       H’m.       H’m.       H’m.  H’m.     H’m.       H’m.     And this was at a time when you had previously told the top 6 of the Governing party, you had told the responsible Minister – Minister responsible for PRASA what was going on, you were busy trying to get corruption – allegations of corruption investigated properly and of course, you had resisted the suggestion – I don’t know if it was a suggestion or by – on your evidence by the former President to say, the Board must take back Mr Montana or review its decision about Montana.  So, all of these things were happening after all of this had happened, is that right?       H’m.     H’m.    H’m.      H’m, h’m yes, no thank you Mr Molefe.     During the – 2017, that would be their last month, the last month of the Board.     Okay that’s fine.     Ja well one keeps on looking for patterns because there was evidence in relation to Denel that the Board that was there before 2015 or that left in 15, if I’m not mistaken, I don’t know whether the Chairperson was Ms van Rensburg or Professor van Rensburg had done a very good job, to the extent that the Minister of Public Enterprises had also commended them for their good work and said that they are – they should continue, they were going to have their term extended but according to Ms van Rensburg that changed inexplicably and they were all either dismissed or allowed to go when their term expired and – except for two Board members, ja okay.     Ja.     He was coming from…[intervenes].     I’m sorry he was coming from your Board.     So, he continued?     Okay.     Ja was he the only member of your Board that continued beyond the time of your Board?     Okay.     I’m sorry just raise your voice a bit.     Oh okay.     That’s before you knew.     Oh.    We should come and?      H’m, did they share with you any reasons why he was saying this, why the Minister had asked them to say this to you or was it simply that he was saying, the two of you were not seeing eye to eye and I’m saying that, knowing that you said you had hardly worked with him here and then he sent you a letter to show cause why you should – the Board should not be dismissed?     H’m, could it mean that he was reluctant to take any action that you could challenge in Court and wanted you to agree to resign, failing which then, you’d just have to be there but not be able to do anything because the Board did not have a quorum?     Getting rid of you.     H’m.    That’s April 2017?      And he had not even met you or the Board in your capacity as Chairperson of the Board and the Board?     Yes.   Did you, by any chance know each other before he became Minister, the two of you, I’m just wondering why somebody who has just been appointed as Minister of Transport who is asked by the Chairman of the Board of PRASA for a meeting and to be introduced to the Board won’t seem to be keen on that but the next thing he wants the Board to show cause why they should not be dismissed?      Okay.     And he should be playing a critical role to make sure that the Board has a quorum because one of the nominees – one of the people who must be Board members is from his department and another one should come from the department of his colleague in Treasury?     H’m.     That is from the Speaker, what about the other people that you copied?     Yes, yes.     Okay.     Did you at any stage get to know whether particularly the Speaker did receive your letter?  Did you get to know whether formally or informally?     Yes.     It had been sent.     Okay.       Okay, if you can identify important features that you can read, you can read.  I think Mr Soni is trying to avoid that …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, Mr Soni, Mr Molefe earlier on asked whether he could just read this letter.  It is not a short letter but I think it is very important.     I think let us ask him to read it.  Mr Molefe, please just read that letter in full, I think it is very important.     This is the letter addressed by Mr Molefe to Ms Dikeledi Magadzi Portfolio Committee on Transport.  I think she was the Chair and it appears as annexure PM13 at page 187.  Ja.     Yes.  Ja.     Okay.  Thank you.     No, no, no, it is not criticism on your part because you do know that we are trying to strike a balance between being quick and – but at the same time doing justice to the issues.     So it is not criticism on your part, it is just that while Mr Molefe was giving evidence I had a look at it and I thought it is important.  Actually – ja, okay.     Ja.     No, no, no, that is alright, that is alright.     Yes and did she ever acknowledge receipt of this letter?     You write to the Minister of Transport, Minister Maswanganyi after his appointment and as I recall you request a meeting for him to meet the board.  There is no response, is that right?  There is no response?     There may be other letters you wrote to which there was no response but you write to – you also write to the Speaker of Parliament raising very important issues about PRASA.  You get no response.  You copy a number of people in parliament and except for the Chairperson of SCOPA it looks like nobody reacts or even acknowledges receipt and you write to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Transport to which PRASA and the board accounts, you raise very important issues yet again you get no response, not even an acknowledgement of receipt.  Is that right?  That is what happened.       Yes.     You see, that is what I am …[intervenes]     That is what I am …[intervenes]     That is what I am trying to understand because the lack of response could be inefficiency, could be incompetence but it could be – could also be just a refusal to deal with you and can it be incompetence with all of these people?  Can it be inefficiency with all of these people or is it that all of them were simply not prepared to interact with you?  And I think from what you have said, you would think that it probably was not incompetence or inefficiency, it was an attitude based on not wanting to deal with you or – maybe I do not know whether this was a way of dealing with you, it was an attitude that we do not want to have anything to do with you.     Yes.     Ja.     The Turmoil in PRASA report?     The PRASA in Turmoil report.     But what you are saying is did you give an open invitation to individuals who were members of the committee who were interested in coming to see ...[intervenes]      It was individuals that you ...[intervenes]      Okay, okay.     Yes.  Were meetings of the committee, as far as you know, being mechanically recorded, as far as you know?     Yes, because it would be good to get the transcripts of what was being said, particularly in meetings between the Board and this committee over the years that you have indicated here, 2015, 2016, 2017.     I didn’t hear that.     Yes, yes, yes.   I have been told that – I don’t know whether with all portfolio committees, but with some committees or all committees don’t record in Parliament, they make notes and only the National Assembly records mechanically, so I don’t know to what extent that information is correct, but if there is a transcript or transcripts we should try and get.     So, and if we don’t get that we nevertheless should try and get maybe two or so other people, either from the Board, your Board, or from the Committee who can tell us some of the things that were happening in that Committee during the time of your Board, you have said in paragraph 106 of your affidavit the meetings of the Portfolio Committees during 2015, 2016 and 2017 could best be described as chaotic.    So it is very important, you get put in a committee in Parliament so that you can exercise a very important responsibility of oversight.     If now members of a committee instead of doing their job they might actually not be doing their job properly while an entity such as PRASA was losing billions of Rands through corruption, it will really be very important to see exactly what was happening.  Were they turning a blind eye to massive corruption that you wanted to tell them about, resulting in the country losing billions in that entity, billions of Rands in that entity, and they were interested in other things.   Let us know if that is what was happening so I would like to know if there are transcripts so that these things can be put in the open, because I keep on saying when we see SOE’s, or a number of them, being in the positions in which they are now in 2020 financially we have got to go back and say when did it start, but Parliament was supposed throughout to be overseeing, to be exercising oversight and where was it as the situation in each of these SOE’s was deteriorating every year, where was Parliament, what was Parliament doing?  Where were the Portfolio Committees, what were they doing about it? So I think Mr Soni you know there should be an attempt to try and see if you can get transcripts, if there are any transcripts of all of those meetings between the Board, this Board and the Portfolio Committee during those years.     And that is such a pity because sometimes people, not sometimes, very often people who might want to take issues to Court don’t have money to take those issues to Court and then – so it is just in certain circumstances where somebody is able to assist or some organisation is able to assist to bring matters to court but if Parliament were to play its part correctly and if it were to play its part correctly it seems that there is a lot of damage that could be prevented from happening and a lot of financial loss that could be prevented, that the country would otherwise suffer.     And in the process a lot of money that is lost to corruption could be used for the needs of the people, because the needs of the people – the people have a lot of needs that need government to attend to, and those needs need money.  Now if Parliament doesn’t do a job properly and corruption levels just keep on going up then the money that is lost through corruption goes to a few, instead of being able to be used for the majority of citizens. Yes Mr Soni I see we are – we have gone past four o’clock but I would like if possible that we finish with Mr Molefe because I am sure he would like to be able to go and do other things. Can we continue Mr Molefe, is that alright with you?     Ja, straight ja.     Yes, yes okay, okay.     No, no that ...[intervenes]      Ja, all of the things that you have been saying are important.     Yes you can read it if you – if that will make it easier for you.  Paragraph 112.     Oh it won’t, okay.    That is the same bundle in front of you is it not?    The same bundle ja.    Ja.  Page 259.    Hm.    Before you do so.    Just for the sake of completeness the Swifambo matter is as it appears from the affidavit of Mr Molefe at page 259 was case number 2015/42219 in the Gauteng Local Division of the High Court.  The matter being Passenger Rail agents of South Africa versus Swifambo Rail Leasing Pty Limited.    Ja.  Okay.    I think you might need to explain to him that you are referring to the founding affidavit that he filed in the Swifambo matter.    Oh but I think he might have something…    Oh okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  But maybe we can deal with it this way.  Mr Soni you obviously have looked at his founding affidavit?    And you know that he did not say anything about this issue.  You can say to him that he can accept that you have checked and he did not say – say anything about this issue and then put the question that you want to put.    2 – on page?    Yes I think let us just get that in the correct context.  At the meeting that you had with Mr Mashaba and Ms Matlala you said that Mr Mashaba said he did not have with him on that occasion information about or proof of payment – proof of payment into the bank accounts of the individuals concerned, is that right?    Yes.  Did – did – were arrangements made for him to later…    Yes.  Ja that is what you said ja.    Were arrangements made for him to provide such proof at a later date and more information?    Mamabolo.    Okay I think that is – let us – then we can move to the schedule ja.    I am sorry do you say 283?    Ja.    I am sorry what I have at 283 is something that has got loan payments.    At the top is it – are we on the same page?    Okay alright.    So let us go back one – one step back.  Subsequent to the meeting that you had with Mr Mashaba and Ms Matlala, Mr Mamabolo was also in the meeting?    Ja subsequent to that meeting when Mr Mashaba gave this schedule to Ms Mamabolo did you understand from Mr Mamabolo that he said this is the schedule of payments that I promised to give or something to that effect?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.  Okay.  So when you got this – these documents your understanding was this document reflects the payments that Mashaba had told you about?    Ja okay.    I am sorry before you go to 285.    Mr Soni do you not want us to – do you not want him to tell us what schedule – this schedule reflects?    At 283?    Oh okay well if you are…    It answers your questions okay.    Oh okay that is fine.  That is fine.    Hm.    I think it…     I am sorry are we looking on the same page?  On my document – my bundle the name Similex appears at page 286 and on page 285 which I think is the page that you referred to Mr Soni unless I have missed something.    I have got consulting engineers.   Oh okay.    So the idea is you want him to talk about page 285?    286 ja okay.    286 has got…    Similex ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Oh okay.  And Similex was?    Hm okay.    Hm.    And then we may as well for the sake of completeness indicate that that invoice is dated the 1 January 2014.    And it is invoice number 002/SML/2014 and it is for a total amount of R100 – is that – what – how much is that?  R14 100 000.00 is that correct?    Yes.    Before you do so Mr Soni, Mr Molefe are you able to see the description of services in respect of which this invoice was being issued?  Are you able to read what the nature of the service – services were – was?    Development and implementation.    Yes.  And in terms of the rate is says 30% of the total amount.  You are able to see that?    Yes okay Mr Soni you can then proceed to – to 283 I think you said.    Before that Mr Soni I think let us – let us get him to first tell us what is reflected in this schedule.  Obviously that will include what you are talking about.    Maybe just to read what is in the schedule there.    And dates.    Are you able to read Mr Molefe the dates, the payee and the amount as reflected in this schedule at page 283?   Where the schedule of payment – payments appears.    That is if it is easy otherwise Mr Soni you can read it in.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Molefe.  Let me just quickly read it the way we – I think we should.  According to this schedule on the 6 May 2014 a company Similex Pty Limited was paid an amount of is that R9 400 000.00 Mr Soni?    And on the 20 January 2014 Similex Pty Ltd was paid an amount of R14 500 000.00, is that right?    And on the 10 January 2014 Similex Pty Ltd was paid R14 100 000.00 and no date is given for another payment to Similex Pty Limited which amounts to R90 000.00 and Similex was paid also another amount on a date that is not given for – it was paid R2 050 000.00, am I right?    Yes and then the last three payments relate to Nkosi’s – Nkosi Sabelo Incorporated on the 11 April 13 Nkosi Sabelo Incorporated was paid R14 300 000.00.  And on the 22 April 2013 Nkosi Sabelo Incorporated was paid R14 200 000.00 and on the 22 May 13 another entity or Nkosi Sabelo was paid two times not three times.  Then on the 22 May 2013 Knowles Husain Links Incorporated trust account – oh it also says in [Nkosi Sabelo Incorporated] was paid R10 400 000.00.  And there is an amount of R79 040 000.00 given there.  And then there is a handling fee of 10% seems to be given as R7 904 000.00 and the whole total is R86 944 000.00.    Okay.  Yes we may continue.     That’s 1 s t January 2014.   Oh, 286, okay, it says, okay yes, okay, the 1th of January?     I am sorry Mr Soni, it can’t be from the same company to the same company.     But I know what you mean.  It is from Simulax to A M Consulting and it is dated 5 January 2014, it is invoice number 003/SML/N14 and it is for an amount of R16 450 000 and the services are described as service rendered by RPGN Planning Development and Implementation.     Some of these things are unlikely to be disputed so you can move faster on them and you can just read them to the witness for confirmation.       Ja.      Before you go to 290, do you want to confirm how you have told – the witness has told us how we come to have this schedule of payments.     It was given to Mr Mamabolo by Mr Mashaba and Mr Mamabolo gave it to Mr Molefe.  What about the invoices from Similex, can we know how we ...[intervenes]      ...come to have that.     Yes, yes, okay.      From the Werksmans investigations.     Do you think we have a different 285, why is this 285 – wasn’t 285 something else?       Oh okay, alright.  185 is a letter from consulting engineers addressed to Mr Dinapather.     It is the letter from Mashaba, and it says the subject is letter of authority and it says payment to a creditor, okay, so what was the question Mr Soni?     Look this side please.     Yes, how did he get hold of this letter, how does it come to be here?   Did it come through the investigation that Werksmans was ...[intervenes]      Okay, thank you.     Okay, thank you.     Okay let us deal with it this way, okay Mr Molefe in this – in your affidavit in this matter page 264 of the bundle before you, you say at page – at paragraph     You don’t have a recollection of this?     Yes.     I think what may be necessary is that afterwards Mr Molefe can be given his entire affidavit in this matter, the replying affidavit, so that he can go through it properly and refresh his memory on the context, then he could in due course maybe send a supplementary affidavit to say after having had – gone back to that affidavit has his memory been refreshed to say this was – this is correct or has he found that it was not correct.     Would that be fine Mr Molefe?     Yes okay, alright.     Well one second, maybe we – it might be convenient to take a comfort break and you could have a look and then we come back, is that fine, but we are at nearly quarter past five, I am still fine about continuing, if you are still fine I am sure everybody would be fine.   Would that be fine, would that help if we have a comfort break?     Yes, okay let’s take a comfort break and then we can come back, we can come back at twenty five past so about ten minutes break. We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS   INQUIRY RESUMES     Your mic.       Okay, is that fine Mr Molefe?   Is that fine, yes.     Yes no that is fine, that will just give you also time to refresh your memory on the document.  I was going to say we will start earlier than ten o’clock but we cannot because of other commitments on my part, so let us start at ten o’clock as normal tomorrow.  I guess that we shouldn’t be long and I don’t want to say we shouldn’t be long because I thought we would not take the whole day but I think everything that we had to deal with was important so I am not regretting that we have taken the whole day, but tomorrow how much time do you think we might need? ADV SONI     Yes, yes, okay, no that is alright.     Ja, the connecting of the dots ja.     Ja, ja, okay then we are going to adjourn and resume tomorrow at ten.  We adjourn. 
MR MOLEFE:  Thanks Chairperson I am on pension.    My name is Popo Simon Molefe.    I do not.    I do.    So help me God.    Chairperson I – I do not intend to go through the articles unless Counsel would like me to do so and refer me to specific ones.  I mean at the time I read a lot of them and I did refer earlier on in my evidence to this campaign to vilify the board and to attack the Chair of the Board and following the – the fact that in November of 2014 the Board had become aware that there was a big tender that was – that had been adjudicated upon and the Chair of the Finance Capital Investment Committee who had been the previous Chair of the Board had wanted the Board that I was chairing to quickly approve that tender for the modernisation of Braamfontein Depot and of course the procurement of the rails and turnouts as part of the preparation for the trains that were going to be coming from Brazil which were being manufactured in Brazil.  And the Chairperson would recall that during my evidence I said that the Board had been misled by the former GCE Mr Montana who had said that he had a probity report when we had asked for the probity report because we needed assurance that the process was proper and was clean.  It turned out that that report did not exist and he knew it did not exist but he lied to the Board.  So that is one aspect now we exposing and we stop that tender process for that time. It involved well over R2 billion.  And then the next time is when we discover and actually insist that Mr Montana gives a report that in fact the Public Protector was not only investigating PRASA but had been asking for comments of PRASA on the interim report that she had given to PRASA.  The Chairperson would recall that Mr Montana then gave me a file containing that report around March 2015.  Now the series of media reports come after we exposed what appears to be corruption at the time.  And of course we were already saying we have got to investigate because the Auditor General also complains about the audit of the financial year.  Now there are dots that one can connect Chairperson.  Chairperson will recall that I – I had also referred to the – what I said was PRASA in turmoil and I said it was a – a report by Mr Montana.  In fact, PRASA in turmoil was a section in the report of Mr Montana.  The real thing is that Mr Montana had written a detailed report on the 27 July addressed to Minister Jeff Radebe who was in the Presidency.  I did say that I had gotten a copy from the whistle-blower but I was struggling to find it.  I regret that Chairperson I am not computer savvy.  I have found it last night.    And I read it but I tried to send it where I could – I could print it.    Then it looks like I have lost it so I would need to get some computer experts.    There to assist it but it is the report to Minister Jeff Radebe on the Board of PRASA.    Recent events at PRASA.    It is a very long report.    When one reads that report there is a – there is a link and connection between a series of media articles and what that report was saying.  Because a lot of what we read in these media articles are also contained in that report.  And quite clearly the target in that report and as can be seen in the articles as well is the Chairman of the Board is a problematic person.  Of course, to some instance in some of – instances the Minister of Transport was also you know targeted for attacks.  So I will look for that report and then it will assist the Chairperson.  Now …    I will be pleased to hear that.  But Chairperson Minister Jeff Radebe has got the report.  If he wants to help the commission he too…    Can make the report available for the commission.    Ja.    If he wants to help the commission.    Now Chairperson when I – I am going to come to the meeting of the – the Top 6.    But when I read the report last night.    It occurred to me that there is an explanation to the question that the Chairperson asked when the Chairperson said, you mean you could start the meeting at 6 and finish at 2?  It is a long report and only Mr Montana knew what the meeting was about.  Him the President and Mr Radebe.  Because he spoke for a long time referring.    And talking from the notes which now turned out that it – it was in fact that – that report which of course Minister Radebe in the meeting denied to have received it.  Mr Montana did not say, I wrote this report to Mr Radebe.  I had told Minister before he went to that meeting that I had received this document leaked to me by a whistle-blower and so she wanted Mr Radebe to give her copy and he denied that he had it in that.  But it explains why that meeting was …    No, no.    He did not say so but he was saying things that are contained in that report.  No, no Mr Montana was saying things that were contained in the report.  And some of the questions that the President also comments he was making it is clear are contained in that report.  And you will see the link between that and these articles.  The essence was that I am Lucky Montana, I am the best Group CEO of this organisation.  I can build PRASA.  This board does not want to give me the opportunity to do that they are destroying me.  There is nobody else who can run this organisation but me.  And I told them that although I said I do not want extension on my contract I have changed my mind now.  If you want me I can come back.  And which is what the President was trying to do to say no, no.    And as I read the report and of course when you read these articles you see what South African Commuters Organisation says even somewhere and he is saying in the article and what Zenzo Mahlangu I refer to him in my evidence earlier on he had been the General Secretary of SATAWU whose union was also doing business of course with the – with PRASA through I think a company called Blackstar but they had a trust called Bashume which belonged to the union.  When you – so it is a common message so around which all of these forces were being mobilised against the Board to some extent against the Minister of Transport as well.  So – so now was corruption widely known at the time?  We had already dealt with the Braamfontein Depot and we stopped it.  We made it clear that we are stopping it because it was irregular and it involved billions of rands.  When I briefed the Top 6 of the governing party – my party I referred to the fact that our investigations show that we have been misled.  There was this tender that was about to be issued which was irregular and we stopped it.  And we are conducting several other investigations which I reveal a massive corruption within the organisation there.  So – so it was known at that time that there was this massive corruption but the speed in which the media campaign mass mobilisation demonstration and all these other forces are being mobilised against the Board clearly to me was intended to stop those investigations.  So to get these people out of the way before the investigations are fully concluded.  Now Chairperson if you look at what we have seen in this process of State Capture itself and I did say so at the beginning of my evidence as well that for it to succeed systems in organisations must be broken, must be weakened.  And I did say that good people were being removed from positions and substituted by people who were compliant who would carry out the agenda whose objective is the looting of the public purse and this central message being that one of State Capture.  So – so here to suddenly people feel that this Board is a problematic board.  Corruption cannot continue for as long as these people are in office.  But the most problematic one is this one called Popo Molefe who is the Chairman of the Board.  Ja.  Get him out of the way and then we can go back to – to our business as usual.  So – so really that – that was the agenda.  You see vilification I mean lies that are being told here about me being corrupt, me being doing this and that. And the judgment in court were evidence arising out of our investigation were presented confirmed the correctness of the positions that we took and proves a lie of what Mr Montana and all of these people were saying.  Because I mean it went right up to the Constitutional Court, and our position as the board of PRASA was repeatedly confirmed.  So, Chairperson, yes, it was public knowledge, the leaders knew about that corruption.      Chairperson, at the – if counsel agrees at the end of my evidence, I would like us to do – well, counsel can tell us when to do it, but I would like us to do what we will call do connecting of the dots.     Because in all of that we can go right to the various ministers, the portfolio committees of parliament.     Speaker of Parliament.     You know, the efforts.     And then letters we wrote.     All of those things and then we can say but what does this mean?     And then when we are busy with this sort of thing and the minister stands in parliament says I am dissolving this board.     So we will have to connect all of those at some point.     Because they give a picture.     Of – and I may want to ask a tough question as well which is similar to what the Chairperson is saying.     That …[intervenes]     Yes, it did say.     That is correct.     Yes, I did say that.     The Chairperson or my predecessor was – is currently one of the Deputy Ministers, Mr Buthelezi, Sifiso Buthelezi.       But at the time in November when he brought the submission, he was the Chairperson of the Finance and Capital Investment Committee.     He actually give me his resignation letter, that is in the – when the board was meeting and he was making the submission for the Braamfontein – on the Braamfontein depot modernisation.     He was – that was the last thing, you know, contract he wanted approved before he left.  Whether there was reason for him to have delayed it or – I do not know.  Of course, when I read Mr Montana’s report to Minister Jeff Radebe, he blames the board for having delayed that tender whereas we were seeing it for the first time at that meeting in November.   But, be it as it may, he wanted it approved as he was leaving.  Whether there was any motive or not, I do not know, and I do not want to impute any motive to that.     Yes, but I did say that the title of the report is not PRASA Internal, it is the report of Minister Jeff Radebe on the board of PRASA and it set out what it says are recent events.  And somewhere in the report of course there is a section that refers to PRASA in turmoil.     He had it.     He said he did not have it.     Well, I – Chairperson, I knew he had it because it came – the whistle blower brought it from his office and it was addressed to him and clearly the manner in which the meeting was conducted found its basis in that report because it was about what Montana was saying largely.     I had seen it much earlier.     But because it was such a sensitive document...     ...I …[intervenes]     It was not official.     So but what …[intervenes]     The report was written on the 27 July, Chairperson.     The meeting took place around the 20 August.     Ja.     I did Chair.  Not that day of the meeting, much earlier.  I did say to her, you know, I have seen this kind of a document.  Of course, I had given it to the lawyers also to keep.  Now I have been trying to get it from them, they do not know what they have done to it.  Ja.     Ja, but I had told Minister Dipuo Peters and that is why in that meeting he said …[intervenes]     She asked for it.     H’m.     Did I talk too much?     Yes.     Counsel, you are asking what were the reasons for the dissolution of the board?  Is that the question?     The first point, Chairperson, is that Mr Montana leaves because his contract is ending and he says he does not want extension but in reality, he wanted extension.  He wanted another contract and clearly, the Minister herself – it will be coming perhaps when you connect those dots you will now see that the Minister is …[intervenes]     Yes.     Will do so, Chairperson.  The board, as Montana left, wanted to appoint a new group CEO and it had gone through an elaborate process of interviewing and had identified a person for that position. Now in terms of the shareholders’ compact and the memorandum of incorporation, the board needs to recommend to the Minister and then of course has got its own protocols, she has then to take it to the President and to the relevant committee of the cabinet and come back.  Cabinet must approve because the cabinet approves appointment of group CEOs, Directors Generals, Commissioners, Chairpersons of board and directors, board of directors, ja.  She was reluctant.  She had told me that she agrees with me, she is not going to change anything, she is going to present it as it was but there was no movement. And the next thing then, she wanted us to appoint in an acting capacity a person who was a Chief Financial Officer in the Department of Transport, Mr Collins Letsoalo.     That is correct, Chairperson.     No, I will disclose it, Chairperson, it was a lady.  I did not know her before that and I was not even in the panel that interviewed.  Her name was Lauriette Modipane Sesoko. She had previously worked for Metrorail.  Now …[intervenes]     Sesoko Modipane.  Modipane.     M-o-d-i-p-a-n-e.     Sesoko is S-e-s-o-k-o.     She had worked for Metrorail.     She had been the CEO of Metrorail or general - the chief of Metrorail, CEO, Metrorail.     Ja.     You know, which is the train – the operating division of PRASA which moves passengers.     Which is fundamentally the mandate of PRASA.     Yes.     But the Minister never raised any concerns about that except that they delayed, delayed, delayed, they were not moving.  I am sure again I can produce several letters to the Minister.  In some instances when the Minister would say PRASA is – this board is not doing its job or PRASA is not performing, I would say the board is not operational, it cannot do the job, we need to have proper management team and management team is put together by the Group CEO, approve the appointment of the Group CEO so that we can get going and get our work done.   And she – it was just delaying, delaying and it is there, I am sure, correspondence would show that, that we raised that.  So we do not know but I, in hindsight now, when you look at the meeting of August, you look at the report where Montana says and he is writing to Minister Jeff Radebe and the President says I am the best man, I am available, this board does not want me to do my job, he is interfering with me.   So what seems to have been then the reason is that they wanted to bring Mr Montana back but the way to do so is to block the appointment of the CEO and then ultimately to remove the board of directors.   It is linked also to the investigations because when Mr Letsoalo, as you would see, probably later on, comes in to act, he says – and the Minister says Letsoala must now be in charge of the investigations.   Now if you are investigating, the management team that is corrupt, you do not know who is corrupt, who is not corrupt.  You do not give it to them to do the job because then you are not going to get the truth out of it and that is why the board wanted this investigation to be done by an entity that is outside PRASA which reports to the - and the chair of the Audit Committee and the chairman of the board and they would report regularly together with the investigators to the Board of Directors and to the Minister of Transport which... which is what we have done. But they wanted all of that out of the way uh, clearly to frustrate the investigations so that the investigations, they not produce uh, the truth about what is happening in the organisation. And I asked the question why would they not want to do that?  H’m?  If they are interested in getting the state-owned company to function and function properly.     H’m.     Oh, Chairperson.  I was in the commission when the minister gave her evidence.     I was here.     Thank you, Chairperson.     H’m. ADV SONI     Ja.  With regard to PRASA, Chairperson.  The... that position has been vacant now for close... going onto five years.        Five years.     Since Montana left.  Now...[intervenes]      Yes, five years.  They... they have been appointing acting people... acting this, acting that.  Five years.  And that is an organisation that is managing R 173 billion of uh, rail and uh, infrastructure investment. Um, so... so... so... but the difference between Mr Gama and Mr Montana’s case is that in the case of Mr Gama they were dealing with disciplinary processes.  So once they had removed the minister [laugh] and appointed another minister, they could simply lift the... or whatever, suspension, bring him back. In the case of Mr Montana, they cannot do that without burning their fingers because the investigations have gone so far and so much of the plot had been exposed and there had already been cases in the courts of law which confirmed the correctness of the positions taken by the board of directors. So you... you need to have extraordinary courage to go against uh, the judgment of the court and uh, appoint a person uh, whose smart in a... in a corruption and there are still other pending cases uh, civil and otherwise. So... so... it... it would not have been difficult.  Uh, it would have been difficult for them to bring him back now after the work we had done. But what I cannot understand...[intervenes]      ...is why then not appoint a prober board?  I must also say, by the way Chairperson, since the departure of my board, PRASA has not had a proper... a properly constituted board.   It had things called interim boards which are not provided for in the law.  Uh, it had all of those things.  It now currently has an administrator, you know, no board. I know that the minister has recently advertised.  He will probably appoint the board uh, soon but.. but that is what we are dealing with uh, in a country with high levels of poverty, unemployment uh-uh, crushing uh, transport costs and so on. Uh, so some of those questions would have to be asked later on.  To be explained by those who...[intervenes]      ...to whom were given the responsibility to govern our country.     That is correct.     Approximately five years.  We...[intervenes]      We asked Mr Montana to leave in July...[intervenes]      ...2015.     H’m.     No, it cannot be.  It cannot be.     H’m.     No, it is... it is correct, Chairperson.  I did indicate that and I said it is a pity that people would not want to come and give evidence here.  That I was advised that there was as teleconference with employees of PRASA and they were encouraged by the Minister, Mr Radebe to... to continue the pressure.  Keep up the pressure on the board.   Uh, the so-called PRASA in turmoil was in that context.  Created that turmoil so that we can justify removing this board.  You see.  So.  [laughs]  The... the... it is.. it is exactly that.  It happened.  Get out of the way, so that the young man may come back.      How long...?     [No audible reply]      That was on the 8t h of uh, of March 2017.     H’m.     She was dismissed the same month.     The same month that was she was dismissed.     I say so, because she was too weak.  She could not remove the board quickly enough.     [laughs]     [laughs]  No, I... I say Chairperson that uh, I think uh-uh...[intervenes]      To have been perceived to have been too late and...[intervenes]      ...and too soft.     Ja.     That is correct.     Yes, yes Chairperson.     That is correct.     That is correct Chairperson.     That’s fine, I remember the letter very well.     The starting point of the Minister was to express concern that the investigation is not ending sooner and that it was costing a lot of money and she was saying that she thinks that we should be focusing on implementing performance plans ensuring that our performance plans are in order and we’re achieving results in that regard.  She referred to the decline in performance and then she says, stop this – in fact she uses the word “close it”…[intervenes].     She’s asking that we close it off and present a detailed report to her by – I think she said, by the end of August.     She says, “I therefore ask that you close off this investigation process and consider the results or report thereof.  Furthermore, the Board is requested to submit a detailed report indicating the progress and the outcome of the investigation.  A determination of any further investigation and a way forward will subsequently be made after studying the report in detail”.     Then she says, “It will be highly appreciated if the report can reach my office by end August 2016”.     That is correct Chairperson.     I did respond, Chairperson.     The date of my response was the 24 t h of August.     That is correct Chairperson.     The – in my response, the essence of my response, Chairperson, to the Minister was that we appreciated the concern that she raised but that the concern that she raises, in our view, did not necessarily relate to whether the forensic investigation was necessary or not and I went on to say – and if I may read…[intervenes].     Maybe I should read it properly, let me read that paragraph, Chairperson.  The paragraph says, having acknowledged, of course, the letter of the Minister, “I understand the concern raised, not to relate to whether or not the forensic investigation is necessary.  The Minister will, indeed, recall that the need for the forensic investigation was discussed and agreed at a meeting between the Board and the honourable Minister at the airport on 17 July 2015”. Now the airport here refers to the O R Tambo International Airport and I go on to say that, “the concerns that I understand to be raised are that the forensic investigation is endless and without any scope, constitutes excessive spending, is not budgeted for and can be regarded as irregular expenditure.  It is also indicated that the Minister ’s own preference is for the Board to focus on the annual performance.”, That’s what the Minister is saying there, and then of course, Chairperson it will be clearer on page 158, page two of the letter that we go in detail to identify why it is necessary, we articulate why it is necessary for us to proceed with the forensic investigation.  Section 50, sub-section 1 of the Public Finance Management Act was obliging the Board to exercise the duty of utmost care, to ensure reasonable protection of the assets and records of the public entity.  Act with fidelity, honesty, integrity and in the best interest of the public entity in managing the financial affairs of the public entity.  On request to disclose to the Executive Authority and Minister responsible for that public entity or the legislature to which the public entity is accountable, all material facts including those reasonably discoverable, which, in any way may influence the decisions or actions of the Executive Authority or that legislature and the last one we make there is, to seek, within the sphere of influence of the Accounting Authority to prevent any prejudice to the financial interest of the State.  Now this is what the law says we should do and that is what we are doing and we are doing it, Chairperson, against the backdrop of a management that has stolen records of the company, covering up, not co-operating with our investigation.  Naturally it will take long for forensic investigators to uncover things because you do mirror imaging of computers, you’ve got to go to the server, you do thing, that ordinarily, management should have been willing to give to the investigators so that we could do our job quickly.  Now the Minister says, no you’re taking too long stop. So, the view then, which we took, Chairperson was that whilst we appreciate the concerns raised by the Minister but we would not stop the investigation.     Yes Chairperson, Section 51(1) provides for the following general responsibilities of the Board and I’m referring here to the Public Finance Management Act. “Must take effective and appropriate steps to collect all revenues due to the public entity concerned and present irregular expenditure, fruitless and wasteful expenditure, loses resulting from criminal conduct and expenditure not complying with the operational policies of the public entity and manage available working capital efficiently and economically”. And then I go on to say, “The above obligations, that is Section 50(1) and general responsibilities Section 51(1) are precisely what necessitated embarking upon forensic investigations and the litigation that followed it”.     That is correct Chairperson.  When – before we appointed the panel, the investigators, we asked the Legal Department of PRASA to advise on the law firms that were on our panel and those that had the capacity, also for forensics and they referred us to Werksmans.  Of course, it would appear, of course, when they gave us that information, they omitted to tell us that, in fact, they should have established a new panel, the time for that old panel had expired, that they should have invited professional companies and established a new panel but that only became apparent when one read the Auditor General’s report.     That is correct Chairperson.     It is so Chairperson.     That is correct, yes Chairperson.     Yes Chairperson the point we’re making was that we are being told, you’re taking too long, stop the investigation but in order for anybody to launch an effective application in a Court of Law, with the possibility of achieving success, we need to have solid evidence and we are saying the people we are litigating against, are actually using the money of PRASA to fight PRASA and that is the irony of the whole thing.  So if we stop the investigation, they succeed, you know and – because these matters are been so politicised they’ll say, after all, they never had a case, it’s just that they want to victimise me as has been the charade of the – the narrative of Mr Montana throughout.      That is correct Chairperson.     I do think so Chairperson…[intervenes].     Ja I think so.     So the point we’re making, Chairperson, there is that here is a – we go to Court, suddenly Siyagena produces a document and they say you, PRASA, have given us a guarantee of R800million, here’s where somebody signed and we had never seen that document anywhere, Management of PRASA who might have been there at the time were not helping to defend the interest of the company.  So this is what we mean, where people use your money to fight you and at this stage, if I recall well Chairperson,  it was just after we had lost a case against Siyagena on a technicality based on the purger rule, which of course later on, following the Gijima Guma matter they changed.     That is what I’m referring to.     I don’t have the details of the contract for now but he would have been the one signing as the GCE of the company.     That would have been the same document, for me it rolls out of the investigations conducted by our investigators.     Chairperson earlier on I did say in my – one of my interventions that, in one of the letters written to the Minister, I had raised concern about her persistently telling the Board to perform yet the Board did not have the Management team.  I see that I deal with that question in this same reply to the Minister and it is at page 163 and it is the last paragraph of …[intervenes].     Of that letter.     The paragraph reads as follows, and again it’s the paragraph of the letter written by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, myself at the time to Minister of Transport on the 24 t h of August 2016, it says, “The Minister indicated that, notwithstanding the completion of an independent robust process, to recruit a permanent group CEO, the Minister ’s view was that PRASA was not ready for such an appointment.  The reason we had consulted the Minister around our recommendation for the position of the group CEO was that we felt that the appointment of a permanent group CEO will assist with stability. We, however, deferred to the Minister ’s preference to second the acting group CEO from the Department of Transport”.     She says so but she says so after waiting for a very long time.     I hoped there could be other matters, where I consistently said to her, we wrote to you, we gave you recommendations, can we please appoint.     She didn’t explain but clearly as one would see this happens after several meetings including that meeting with the President where an attempt was made to bring Mr Montana back.  Of course one of the reasons that they – they tried to use to justify that was contained in this report to Mr Radebe of Mr Montana which we are looking for which says that you know the Organisation for African Unity had adopted a resolution that committed South Africa to becoming a manufacturing hub for rail and rolling stock for the African continent.  And they say that you therefore need a person with knowledge of this business like Mr Montana in that thing.    So that he does not say it here but I am saying it from my own…    Interactions with them.    Then we can deal with it.    This is the report of letter to the Minister.  Not the back one.    Ja this is the document.  [indistinct    Chairperson this is the document I was talking about.  A report on recent developments at PRASA and it is – it was addressed to Minister Jeff Radebe.    Who at that time was responsible for monitoring and evaluation in the presidency.    I am just worried that we might lose it again.    I wanted to go ahead here to [indistinct    Well of course Counsel can guide me but I thought on paragraph 5 I do not know if Counsel would allow me to.    Chairperson I wonder if Counsel would not like to read that?    There is a part I would like to read.    The – it is paragraph 5 of the…    Page 164 and it…    The caption is whether the investigation should be stopped and a detailed report be submitted to the Minister.      And it goes onto say   And then…    Yes.    To the extent that the instructions are in conflict with the law the Board is not obliged to take those instructions Chairperson.    Other point we are making and that is why I went back to that paragraph again because it restates that.  And that is why probably the public should understand because sometimes people say but what is wrong with this Chairperson.    You are disobeying the leadership.    It is the President, it is the Minister why do you not just keep quiet and do as they tell you?  But in the end, I think I have my own responsibility and my own integrity also to – to protect.  I might not be holding a high position in society but I have also been heavily done I know the values and principles that have inspired me, guided me and why I am involved in what I am involved in and – and why it is necessary therefore not to equates in anything that violates those values and principles.    Yes.    That – that is correct.    Am I sure?  Okay Chairperson thanks and that is page 165.    Just above the three bullet points at the bottom there. “We have endeavoured to keep you abreast of the progress of the investigations.  This has been done through amongst others.  A meeting with you in Rivonia focussing on the preliminary irregularities found in the Swifambo contract. This meeting was held on 28 August 2015.  A meeting at Werksman Attorneys during November after the launch of the Review Application in respect of Swifambo contract.  The last written report was on the 7 July 2016.”    And then I go on, on page 166 Chairperson the paragraph – first paragraph on that page and now    I –    No, no let me.    No Chairperson we – the – that report was given to the Minister and the Chairperson should by now be aware we have regularly reporting to the Minister.    On a range of sensitive issues.  And the Minister obviously accounts to the President and the Cabinet.    I expect that you would have been reporting to the Cabinet.    As well.  So it then means that the government would have become aware.    That were taking place.    In an organisation that is expected to spend R173 billion over 20 years.    Yes Chairperson.    That is correct.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is so Chairperson.  The Minister went    And sent the acting Director General in the Department of Transport.    I was not well on that day so I could not go to Parliament.  I had just had an eye surgery.  But on the same day I wrote several letters to the Speaker of Parliament.    To the Chair of the Portfolio Committee.    Dealing with what I felt was not the correct way of managing exercising oversight on the affairs of PRASA but also asking the Speaker of Parliament to initiate an enquiry.    On Transport.    Oh behalf of PRASA    It was the acting DG.    From the Minister.    That is correct Chairperson.    Not at all Chairperson.    Not at all.    I was called Chairperson by one of our directors who was a delegate at the Portfolio Committee meeting.    And he calls me he says   My recollection Chairperson is that the date on the letter is the 8 March as well.    But besides – besides Chairperson.    There is a separation of powers between the legislator and the executive.    The executive is not obliged to go and dismiss the Board in – in a Portfolio Committee meeting.    The Minister should meet with the Board of Directors.    It is casa concerns.  Well the Minister appoints and dismisses directors so if she does it properly follows process we would not even have gone to court.    But the precisely because we too could not understand why she chose to act in a manner in which she did.  We thought it was improper for us to allow abuse of power, abuse of authority in the manner in which it was done.    That is correct Chairperson.    And my view is that it all centres around the investigation.    And the fact that the Board is perceived to be stubborn.    When it is told do not do this, do not investigate, it says no, no we will investigate because…    We have fiduciary duties to be discharged.    So everything centres around this – you    That were beginning to emerge.    From that investigation.    That is correct Chairperson.    Well a significant number of directors we normally feel that you do not have to take the entire board to a Portfolio Committee and expand its money in hotels and air tickets unnecessarily so normally we take a reasonable number with executives – executive management to go particularly the Group CEO, the Chief Financial Officer and the Company Secretary.    That is – that is…    That is what…    That is correct Chairperson.    That would have been the case or after the Portfolio Committee has met and after the Board had discharged its duties to the Portfolio Committee because that will report had to account.  It did not matter if after a week or so she decided now you have done your job go.  But then she does it in the manner in which she did then which means actually this is fruitless and wasteful expenditure.    Chairperson the difficulty one has is that there appears to be a group of people some of the Ministers including the President and members of Parliament who was in May go to conferences and adopt resolutions on corruption but they do not mean what – what they say.  They do not mean to fight this.  So the – everything pivots around the investigation, the fight against corruption.  So it is a – it is an all-round mobilisation of various vast instruments at the disposal of those who do not want to confront corruption.  And they were found – that Portfolio Committee maybe if Counsel might later take us to the letter I wrote to the Chair of the Portfolio Committee.    That Portfolio Committee itself says we do not want this Board, dissolve it.    Now it is not their duty to say to a Minister dissolve the Board.    The Minister has got the executive authority.  She must decide.    Whether you know the Board is serving its purpose or not.  But they saying all of those things.  They are not saying to the Minister we want you to account.    For staying for such a long time without a Group CEO for such an important company.    Company and somebody was reminding me by the way that it was not only the CEO, the Group CEO.  The company also did not have a Group Chief Financial Officer.    It has to put in place financial controls.  It must ensure that it manages the finances of the business allocated to it by National Treasury to Parliament properly but there is no Chief Financial Officer.  The Oversight Committee that should be demanding this thing is not saying it.  It is worried about why are you keeping the Chairperson of the Board?  Why are you keeping this Board?  Why do you not get them out?    So – so the – the – I think the Minister reached a point where she had to pander to this thing to the demands of the Portfolio Committee.  Secondly the meeting we had with the President and Minister Jeff Radebe was sending a clear message that we do not want this Board.    We do not want this Board.  We do not want this Chairman.    So it must go.    So I had said earlier on in my evidence Chairperson that there was something that I have also found strange whilst professional organisations could investigate all kinds of things vetted through their normal regulatory bodies and so on. In the case of this investigation there was a demand that National State Security Agency should vet the people who were investigating at PRASA.  That investigation had begun to shake the tree so much that there was a lot of discomfort in many quarters which sometimes make you wonder whether many of these people were not aware of the wrongs that were happening at PRASA and whether they themselves were not beneficiaries of what was happening there in one way or the other. So I think the dismissal of the board was planned, was being discussed elsewhere and it was staged in such a way that it must give maximum publicity and embarrass the directors.  I would have expected the Minister to call at least me, as the Chair of the board, to say do not be surprised, I have considered this and that about your board and I have arrived at a conclusion that we should dissolve it.   I would probably have said ja, but Minister, let us at least arrange for you to meet with the board so that you can explain to us and maybe then tell us to go at that meeting.     The purpose for the board appearing before the Portfolio Committee is to account for its work of the preceding year.  Now naturally given what we had been busy with, the board was going to have to talk about rampant corruption, the litigations that were under way.  They would have had to talk about the police refusing to do their job, many reports that we had given to them, civil actions taken and so on.   They would not have loved that to happen and one of the things that would probably had featured there would have been what appears in the Swifambo matter where monies were paid to individuals who came to say look, you are going to get this big contract, you know, you have got to share that money with somebody, you know?   So all of those things may well have been things that made people restless at the time.     I do have, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is so.     Yes, this is the document, Chairperson,     Made at 27 July in the last page and it also states that the report compiled by Tshepo Lucky Montana.     Oh, 11 page report, yes, Chairperson.     I did, Chairperson, I called the rest of the directors and suggested that we challenge the decision.  I did also say, of course, regardless of whether they joined me in doing so or not, I was going to challenge it, so – and that is what we did, we instructed Webber Wentzel firm of attorneys to be our attorneys-of-record.     There should be a letter of the minister, very scanty.     I said there is a letter that simply dismisses us.     Recollection is that it does not even give much reasons to say performance or something to that effect.     That is an issue that is covered in the judgment, that is why I wanted to go to the judgment.     Yes.      Yes.     To court, yes.     No, I understand.  As it unfolded.     The letter would be really addressed to each one of the directors by the Minister.  It would not be the one read in parliament.     It was not there.     Would have been addressed to the Portfolio Committee advising them that …[intervenes]     That the board is being dissolved.     I will do, Chairperson.     I would rather wait to see the letter.     My recollection is that the reasons were really not substantive.     They simply said poor performance.     That is why in court it was dismissed as an irrational decision.     Is it this one?     Yes, I do have it.     I am on 124, paragraph 51, Chairperson.     Paragraph 51, Chairperson reads as     That was the first time.     That was the first time, Chairperson.     The media, the media, the public were given a reason.      “In her answering affidavit she set out two fundamental reasons for her decision.  Firstly, she claims that the trigger for the relevant directors’ removal was their decision to terminate Letsoalo’s secondment to PRASA.  She states that the board was removed because the board acted in unison in frustrating the actions of Mr Letsoalo and ultimately removing him.  Furthermore...” And I am on now page 125, Chairperson. “Furthermore, she claimed that she substantially complied with the procedural fairness, obligations in respect of this complaint because she wrote to the board on 1 March 2017 and asked it to explain its public spat with Letsoalo and to furnish reasons why she should not intervene in order to restore good governance within PRASA.  Secondly, the Minister claimed that she had wide-ranging concerns about the board management of PRASA.  She considered it to have been involved in corruption and in irregular expenditure since its appointment.  Quite clearly, nowhere does she state that she afforded the relevant directors an opportunity to be heard on these issues before she took the decision to remove them from office.”     It is slightly warmer, Chairperson.     Paragraph 56 of the judgment, Chairperson,     Paragraph 60, Chairperson, the first sentence reads as follows. “I have reached a conclusion that the applicants, or should I say the removed directors, have proved that they have a clear right to challenge the decision taken by the Minister and furthermore, to have the decision reviewed and set aside or to obtain an order suspending the operation of the notices of removal.  The removed directors…” Okay, that is the sentence, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is so, Chairperson.  So maybe we will still get to know the real reasons from their side.     That is so, Chairperson.  That... by the way, I should also say that immediately after she announced the removal of our board, she appointed what she called an interim board.       Ja.  And uh, of course, shortly after that the president uh, reshuffled the cabinet and she was uh, replaced by Minister Maswanganyi.       Uh, immediately when Minister Maswanganyi and me was appointed, I wrote him a letter congratulating him and welcoming him and saying that uh, the board would uh, wish that he... he comes and meet with the board.  Uh, and of course, I also advised him that uh, the... the court had reinstated us.  Um, he...[intervenes]      No, the interim board had been put in place.  Uh...[intervenes]      But it... it...[intervenes]      It had to go ...[intervenes]      ...and let it go.     Mr Maswanganyi did not respond positively.     He... he did not respond to my letter.     Um, and I think I have got correspondence uh, in that...     ...in that regard which we...[intervenes]      ...I can avail to the court.     Uh, he showed me after that, also served notice on us.     A small detail and given reasons, detailed reasons why we should be uh... he... he demanded that... he gave us seven days.     Uh, to show cause why we should not be removed ...[intervenes]      ...as a board for... for failure to perform.     He has... he has not even met with this board but he wanted to dismiss it.     It... it...[intervenes]      [Indistinct 00    [No audible reply]      That is correct, Chair... Chairperson.     He did not go ahead with the treat Chairperson. ADV SONI     But I see no date has provided where he signed and I do not see any date on page 1 of the letter.     [No audible reply]      Page...?     Ja, let me see.     I am looking at my...     Ja.     Ja, ja.     H’m.     That... that is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     He... we asked for time extension and he gave us only day because he said [laughs]... his initial timeline was a year.  The 21s t uh-uh, of June.     And he said, “okay, I give you until the 22 nd”.     Uh-uh, so the... and I am saying he is achieving the uh, seeking to achieve the same objective, the same goal of uh, the previous uh, minister through uh, a different uh, means.  And... and he...[intervenes]      Uh...     Ja.     So... so what he did was... by the way, I should say that, when I wrote to the minister, I also advised him that there were vacancies on the board.  That the board did not have a quorum.  And he needed to speedily appoint uh, directors to those vacancies. Even if he was not to follow the tedious process of nominations, there were two directors who were working for government.  One was in his department.  The other one would have come from the National Treasury. A vacancy there arose because that individual who was a nominee of National Treasury resigned as an employee of National Treasury and that could not continue as a representative of National Treasury on the board. So I was asking him to fill uh, those posts.  And uh, so he did not.  Uh, he refused to do so.  So achieved the dysfunctionality of the board by simply not discharging his responsibility as a minister to appoint a board so that the board could function properly.     There... there were four vacancies.     Uh, four.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct.     That is true.     He... he does not do it.     Uh...[intervenes]      He... he did respond in a very irrational manner.  He says, “no, it takes a long time to... to appoint directors”.  He has got to follow the process of nomination as required by the law.     And then he says, “with regards to these nominees of the department, even if they come from those departments, I must still take them to the cabinet”.     [laughs]  For the cabinet to... to decide.     Now, the... the cabinet is unlike... it is to say to the Minister of Finance... when the Minister of Finance says, “my nominee ...[intervenes]      ...”to that board is this person...[intervenes]      ...”whom I trust...[intervenes]      ...”works for this department”.  They would not say, “no, no...[intervenes]      ...no, we cannot.  We challenge you”.     He, as a result of what... what he is, he does not... he... he can notify the cabinet...[intervenes]      ...that I have nominated so and so on that board and then we have got this nominee of National Treasury.     Not to say to the cabinet “decide for me whether I can nominate...[intervenes]      ...”my employee...[intervenes]      ...”who in terms of the law, I am prepared to nominate...[intervenes]      ...”and appoint as a director to that board”.     But... but he was saying that.  So clearly the intention was not bad.     It was an urgent matter.        The question is whether there was the intention...[intervenes]      ...to have a functioning board.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Yes.     On what page are we on?     Oh, the affidavit?     Okay.  Um...       And that is the point I made earlier on.     That is Minister Maswanganyi.     “I later found out that the directors were lobbied to resign from their respective positions on the board.  The intention being to isolate me as the chairman so that I could not be effective”.     “Some directors including the representative of the National Treasury did resign”.  And I have given the circumstances under which that one resigned.     “They were not replaced.  The nominee of the Department of Transport stopped attending board meetings.  These developments left the board ineffective as its quorum could not be formed”. Now, the... I... I was advised by some of my directors um, that they were actually approached and asked to resign.     [laughs]     Ja, I am learning the hard way how     Refraining to ...[indistinct 00    My... by my directors.     They were lobbied to resign.     Yes.  Uh, in fact, one of them told me that the acting director general...[intervenes]      ...promised her that “if you resign, we will appoint you to another board.  Do not worry”.  For now, you know?       He would not... he will appoint you again.     Um, of course uh, the chair of the Audit Committee resigned and the chair of uh, the Human Capital Committee uh, also resigned.     Um, so it was quite clear that that was a drive to uh, to make this board dysfunctional.     Because of the big job that it was doing...[intervenes]      ...which other people cannot ...[indistinct     Uh, it was uh, Zodo Manwazi(?) [00    Ja.  Uh... well, there... there have been another director, by the way.  I should have said this.  Who had resigned much earlier but it had nothing to do with... with this uh-uh... um, she is an attorney by trade.     Uh, Ms Kesho.  Ja.     Ja.  Um, from KZN.     From Kwazulu Natal.     So uh, that was the position.     Correct so.     Yes.     Yes.     She.  She.     But she refused to resign.     That one refused to resign.     Ja.  The other two resigned but of course, they all said, “no, we are not lobbied.  It is okay”.     Yes.  Um, so um, because ...[intervenes]      ...part of the difficulty uh, Chairperson we have...[intervenes]      ...is that uh, there are people who are experience things but would not have the courage to come and talk here.     That is the problem.     With that.     Ja, it is a serious problem because a person would say, “this colleague of mine resigned and he... he also tried to persuade me to resign but I refused”.  But if I were to say to that person “come and... the story you told me, go and say to the commission”.  Yes, you see?  Uh, he might, of course... the Commission has got the power to subpoena...[intervenes]      You can do that.     H’m?     No... no attempt was made Chairperson to prepare for the time when the term of office of the then board was coming to an end.  So it was going to be dealt with as if it is an after-thought.     But uh, on the resignation... I must make this point.  On the... on the resignations of the directors, I was saddened deeply when the chairperson of the Audit and Risk Committee of the board was one of those who resigned. And resigning at a time when the board is busy with the audit for that year, finalisation.  Who was supposed to go and give an account for how it will be used, the finances appropriated to by uh, PRASA. But that chair of the Audit Committee goes away and that is a function backed by the chair of the Audit Committee.  So... so I... I think it is important that people explain their actions as well.  It is a very important position of a professional. And... and it... it shows how for experienced people could lead to a collapse of a very important organ of state which served the poor people to please somebody who is into my office elsewhere.  Uh, Chair.     Ja, it was clear.     Well, I do not know Chairperson.  But I... I... it boggles my mind also.  I mean, if you take the Minister Maswanganyi of Transport, he writes to the board in June.  I think it was something like the 14 t h of June.  He says, “show me cause why I should not dismiss you all?”.  Now he writes that letter...[intervenes]      ...and he notes that at the end of July...[intervenes]      ...the term of office of that board is ending.     Yes, Chairperson.  He should have used that time to identify directors he wanted to serve on the board.     And run the process.  It does not make sense to dismiss people when they are left with a few weeks.     ...when... at the end of July.     The term of office is ending.     And you have failed to discharge your own obligations to what that board...[intervenes]      ...which in terms of the shareholder compact...[intervenes]      ...you should be discharging because it is one-way uh, street.  Where... when... when the board had to perform, the minister required to give the necessary support ...[intervenes]      ...from the department and the executive to enable the board and management to do their work.     But she chooses rather not to do that.     And focus on removing the Board.     And all of these things they gain momentum after the meeting of July of 2015 tell us Mr Montana you go, and after the meeting with the President and Minister Jeff Radebe where we said in the meeting that as far as we are concerned this man’s contracting is ending he’s got no lifetime employment with the company, the Board has got no intention to retreat on his decision.  We have asked him to stay previously, he told us he doesn’t want to stay.  So, all of these things – and by the way I keep coming back to this thing, they come also against the backdrop of the Swifambo matter where now, you know, we’ll prove in the Court that there’s huge corruption here.  We have this litigation, the Siyagena matter and so on, so all of this, you can see that there is a relationship between the determined fight against corruption by the Board on one side and those that don’t want that work to continue and we had nobody to protect that Board.  At some point I was the only one dealing with the issue of corruption, at one point.     That is so Chairperson.     So basically, what people are saying is that we’re going to show them that power resides here not with them.  Something similar to what we are experiencing in the United States of America now where the President of the country is perceived to be doing things that are flouting the constitution and doesn’t respect the rule of law but because he’s a powerful man with big monies, people just support what he is doing and then they allowed the impeachment process again, his colleagues, even when they know that they are wrong, they stood behind it.  Then the next thing, what does he do, he goes and remove all the good – the best prosecutors out, he once promised he goes to the Court he wants the Judges to be – those who would ignore the basic tenets of the law and the constitution and defend him as a person and we have seen it here.     We have seen it with our own President and all of those people representing the Governing party in Parliament.  We’re behaving as if we didn’t see anything wrong with how public funds were appropriated for personal benefits.  They defended that position until the Courts decided – okay because we are failing to do what you’re supposed to do, we as a Court will tell you what the right thing is.     So, there is a danger in allowing this kind of abuse of power, abuse of office by anybody, because it can lead to losses of lives, it can destroy the economy and livelihoods of ordinary citizens and it is important, therefore, that there must be people that stand up against this and by the way, and I said so before, the fundamental issue that drives us to be our values and principles, rather than to say, I have a membership card, this party, I love these colours of this party, it’s not about the party, it’s about the liberties, the rights and freedoms of ordinary South Africans because even when people engaged in challenging the old system it was not so that a particular party must be the one that must be one that is in power it was so that South Africans must be able to choose who must govern.     Yes sir.     That is correct.     There is the – the law requires that the Board should have a representative of the South African Local Government SALGA so that was the only person re-appointed, Mr Xolile George.     Am I saying re-appointed to?     He was coming from my Board, he had also been in the previous…[intervenes].     Ja.     He knows PRASA more than anyone.     That is so Chairperson.     Both of whom came from the province, Limpopo.     George Sebulela and Solo Rasta to come and say to me, look man – in fact they were the ones who got to know, even before me, that some of my Directors had resigned – some of the Directors had resigned and so they come, they say, your Directors have resigned…[intervenes].     Ja.     And you know, the Minister says we should come and talk to you.     Talk to you, ask you, to agree to an amicable separation, that he is willing to organise a media briefing press conference where he will announce that you and him have agreed to part ways, that you have agreed to – you have decided to resign.  I said to the Minister – to these gentlemen go and tell the Minister that if that is what he wants to communicate to me, he should rather come and do it himself, let it not be you. I thought that was an important point that needs to be made because it emphasises the extent to which – and the lengths to which they were prepared to go, to get this Board out or especially the Chairperson.     No, they didn’t say that Chairperson, the only reason they were latching on was that, look, you now do not have a complete Board you don’t have a quorum.  Which is what you will see later, when I have a meeting with the Minister which would have happened before these guys came because I insisted on meeting with him to say, look I need to talk to you about PRASA and you need to come and meet with the Board.  He was not interested in any other thing I wanted to say to him, his first prize was to drive home the fact that there is no quorum so we don’t have a Board and he is not going to appoint a Board, so he’s basically saying, why don’t you go.  So, these guys come now to continue what he was telling me when I met him.     I think earlier on, he wanted to find an easy way of …[intervenes].     Dissolving the Board because as we can see, by June he had mustered enough courage now, to want to take us to Court on which he attempt he retreated as soon as we wrote to him and told him that, you’re actually trying to achieve the same things that your predecessor tried to achieve but you’re trying to do it by different means.  So, I think he wanted to do it quietly, I think he didn’t want damage, maybe publicity or something because when you do it that way, you are the only one who talks and say, no the Chairman came, he said to me he’s resigning, I’ve accepted his resignation, it was a clinical way of doing it.     I have to check but I think around April or so, maybe somewhere there.     2017, April/May 2017.     Yes.     He had never met the Board, but I had asked to see him.     To persuade him, firstly, that he has to make sure that his nominee attends meetings, that National Treasury sends its representatives and begin the process of filling the vacant post but we were not able to discuss much when I met him, he was not interested in the affairs of PRASA.  His main business was to see how soon this Board could go.     I got to know him when he was a member of the Portfolio Committee on transport but he had been a young member of the governing party, a member of the youth league and I think, later on he worked for the government of Limpopo but I didn’t know him that well.  I got to really see him at the Portfolio Committee meetings, so we don’t really have any history or relationship.     That is correct Chairperson.     Well Chairperson with regard to Minister Dipuo Peters it was not necessary to discuss it because the Board was there, the only time when there were problems with the Board was when she decided, unilaterally and without any due process or notification to the Directors that she was dissolving the Board, so – and once she had done so, I mean, the battle lines were drawn there was no time to negotiate, safe now in Court now to say what counsel is saying now in the Court papers which is what we did.  The other Minister, knows very well as a former member of the Portfolio Committee and also having worked in government, knew that the Board needed to be there for State owned entities and in fact, when you read his long letter to me, to the Board, addressed to me, he does say that the Board is the Accounting Authority, so he knows very well.  So we – Chairperson, I say, this Minister the last one, Maswanganyi, never made time to meet with the Board except when I met him alone and in that instance I raised the fact that the Board has to go and account in Parliament, the financial year is and has just ended and we’re finalising the audit we’ve got to go to the Board, we’ve got to go and report the annual reports to the Board.  So that is all I could say and, not interested in that, he simply says, ja but your real Board does not have a quorum.     No, he knew Chairperson.     Yes Chairperson.     Yes Chairperson, the – ja I don’t know because, how they will justify that and I don’t know how the Cabinet allows that to happen, I don’t know how the President of the country and Deputy President of the country would allow for this thing to continue, I don’t know how the Minister of Finance, who runs Treasury, would allow this to go on because even if the Court might have wanted to forgive you, they might have said, maybe well you know, government cannot allow for a vacuum to exist they needed to find something to run but the fact that when they have the time they are not even beginning the process of ensuring that a substantive Board has been appointed.  It’s something that is inexplicable, of course I must say that Minister Mbalula has recently come in and I saw that he has advertised, maybe PRASA will now have a Board after spending five years without a Board of control.     That is so Chairperson.     That is so Chairperson.     Chairperson we had tried everything in the book.  We had discussed with Ministers, we had attempted to report in Portfolio Committees, we had been to Courts, we had tried the Law Enforcement Agencies to assist, we were not getting the help we needed. I thought Parliament, as the National Body that represents the whole country might be willing to know what is happening in PRASA because Parliament is the one, by the way, that approves appropriation.  When the Minister of Finance comes and presents the budget various department, having been allocated certain amounts of money must still have that approved by Parliament.  So it was important that the Speaker of Parliament takes interest in PRASA and what was I asking for, I was asking for a public inquiry because you had this many stories that are being told in the newspapers and what the Chairperson will read in this report that was written by Mr Montana for Mr Radebe, all kinds of lies.  Now I needed to have Parliament conduct a robust public inquiry and then I was prepared to subject myself to that.  That letter went without acknowledgment, up to now.     That’s correct Chairperson.     Should I read the paragraph?     Well I was bringing to her attention, the fact that PRASA does not have a group CEO and that it is important for PRASA to have the group CEO and therefore to investigate, they should get the minutes that would account for that in a sense. And the second one was to deal with a number of contracts, informed them about civil proceedings that were under way to the tune of R7 billion and the fact that we are basically seeking to have them set aside and then, of course, the steps that were being taken by way of disciplining employees who were found to have conducted themselves in a manner unbecoming.   Then, of course, I dealt also with my engagement or PRASA’s engagement with the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations, the Hawks, and the NPA and the reports that were given them in terms of the requirement of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act.   So really to give a status report and to say these are challenges, they require a deeper inquiry by parliament and it should be a public one.     Yes, Chairperson, it is the meeting that I could not attend of the Portfolio Committee on Transport and that meeting was happening over two days.  The report I got from the directors was that they were simply subjected to abuse, insults.  The agenda that they were given on which the discussion was supposed to be conducted was just ignored, everything was just attacked, attacked about Swifambo, why are you going to court with these people, why are you appointing private investigators when you should be using the South African Police Services?  But we know South African Police Services was crippled by that time, you were not going to get anything out of them at the time because systems were broken.   So basically, that is what we were saying and I was indicating that, of course, our term of office is also ending soon and that it was important that for those matters be dealt with and would like to account on those matters.       That is correct, ja.     No response, no acknowledgement, up to today.     None of them.  I think SCOPA.  SCOPA was in the process of arranging for us to meet and not an inquiry per se but we did go to SCOPA.     To report on some of these matters and they also came to visit PRASA.     There was nothing.     I asked the company secretary if the letter would have been sent by email but it would also have been hand delivered.  I did, I did …[intervenes]     I was assured by the company secretary that it was delivered.     H’m.     That is correct, Chair.     Is that paragraph 5?     Yes, yes, yes.     Well, the – really, the contents of this letter are more or less similar to what – that of the Speaker of Parliament.  We were again indicating that the Auditor-General’s report of 14/2015 financial year, which identified irregular expenditure to the tune of 550 million was – should I not just rather read because, you know, to talk, I think it is going to be difficult.     No, it is basically to say what we have been doing.     There has been the Public Protector ’s report, Auditor-General’s report, there have been investigations that we have conducted.     And there are certain steps that we had taken.     To respond to all of those things.     And we indicated that although, for example, in 2014/2015 irregularities amounted to 550.  Irregularities for 2015/2016 were now going to over R14 billion and we will show what – that all of these were uncovered by the investigations that we had conducted.     Yes, Chairperson, the essence of my letter was that we are doing our job, we are responding to all these irregularities that have happened and the results show what effort we are making to achiever good governance but your committee has so far not been interested in the exercising of its oversight to focus on things which are germane to good governance.  On the contrary, you allow the meetings of the committee to be chaotic, you allow members of the committee to attach management and directors and attack their persons and that really, looking at what we are doing to fix this organisation, you should be showing a modicum of respect to the board of directors of PRASA and I said please, manage your meetings properly now.  You do not send people an agenda that says we require you to come and report or account on the following issues.  They get there, you have forgotten about that agenda, people are all over the place, they are talking about personal things, there is nothing about the country, about the company.     Ja.  Let me try.     The subject of the letter, Chairperson, is    And I did that immediately.     No acknowledgement, nothing.     No response, Chairperson.     That is what happened.     That is what happened, Chairperson.  The message in that silence is very clear, we do not want you.     You should not be there.     So we are not going to dignify you with an answer.     Well, I wrote many letters, Chairperson.     At least I know that Mr Sean Abrahams replied my letters.  He was not going to do what I was saying he should do but I at least he replied, you know?  Ja.     Yes, Chairperson, it was really not something new and again, things changed after we agree with Mr Montana that he would not get another contract and after we insist that as a board we should do what the Public Protector is asking us to do, answer the questions she is asking and investigate those matters that she wanted us to discuss.  So all of that and up to the dismissal of Mr Montana. So we start seeing this behaviour.  I was going to say, Chairperson, that if one looks at some of the things that I say, the Portfolio Committee was saying to my directors, they are pretty similar to the contents of this report that was …[intervenes]     The PRASA in Turmoil.     Now it does give one the impression that it too was shared with them.  So it is an organised group.  The basis of that organisation is how to get rid of this board, how to stop their investigations into corruption. Now repeatedly, therefore, when the directors went to the Portfolio Committee, it was just a circus.  It was a circus, sometimes somebody just stands up and say we understand and employee somewhere is being purged because he is not wanted, he is not supporter of this board or because you believe he is a supporter of Lucky Montana.  Now you do not have that nonsense, that’s what the Department of Transport should investigate if it thinks that the Board is not doing what it is supposed to, but that is what they are doing.  We often got the impression that there is some kind of rehearsal before we appear before the Portfolio Committee.  Our engagements were always hostile and acrimonious, and when people asked questions it was something akin to people who have gone through chorography of some point, you know your party this one played, and sometimes you would see that they sat somewhere writing questions and they distributed questions amongst themselves and you literally hear them saying having covered that one that question, having covered that question, it is not about them listening to the reports that is placed before them and then responding to that report, it is about what they were told by somebody from outside to ask the Directors when they come to Parliament. So that is how that Portfolio Committee was playing its role and when you say to them we need to focus on the business of the committee they say you are not going to tell us how to do our job.     It was mainly the ruling party, it was the ruling party, you would have thought that the ruling party knowing that it is the government of the day and the SOE’s that it is in charge of that they would try to assist those SOE’s to do their job properly and protect them.  It wasn’t so.     The paragraph 108 reads as follows     Yes.     No there was a voice, I mean they were asking about those, there were also those who were genuinely concerned about operations of Metrorail, especially in the Western Cape, so they were asking and by the way I can now say so, that when it became clear that this committee is not interested in what we are doing I invited willing Parliamentarians, even from the opposition, to visit and see, meet with the investigators to see the work that we were doing, because the Portfolio Committee was not allowing that space for a proper report, or if it was there it was not allowing for a discussion of that report.     No, no, no, who were part of the Portfolio Committee.     Some of them of course would have been in SCOPA.     No there were not members of the ruling party.     No, no, no, I ...[intervenes]      It was individuals who were showing interest in what we were doing.     And who were realising that sitting in those sectors of meetings they were not going to get proper information.     They are supposed to be.     It would certainly be good to do so Chairperson.      I said it will be good, it will be helpful.     Yes.     Yes.     Any normal being would be shocked by the level, the extent of this corruption, and they were shocked and they wanted action.  They wanted action.  And when the Chairperson says were they not concerned that these things were happening.  If they were concerned, they would have supported my efforts to compel the Hawks to investigate their cases and to explain to us why they are not discharging their constitutional duty.  That should have been the work done by Parliamentarians, so they were not doing it. But I am saying the opposition was supporting, look Swifambo, because they – sometimes they are political parties so they will try to score points against one another.  The articles we were reading this morning, we were looking at this morning there is a section where the EFF specifically raises concern about the fact that PRASA was spending R3.5billion on locomotives that are dysfunctional, that are not fit for purpose. So we want people to be saying these things from all kinds of parties because it is about the country now, it is not about sectarian interest, it is about all of our people.     I suppose if Parliamentarians could do that, that is what Dr Helen Suzman used to do, those many years when she was the only Parliamentarian of the PFP, but if there is a particular agenda that is being pursued, and you have the governing party that has got a leader like the current President of the United States who is doing what he is doing, people are dying of Covid-19 and he doesn’t encourage people to be like you Chairperson and me wearing masks, he just goes there, he organises indoor big meetings and he breaks the system to appoint cronies as prosecutors, as judges, so if the Hawks are run by cronies, people with a particular agenda, not agenda of enforcing the rule or ensuring the rule of law, if they are not ensuring the rule of law they can – opposition can guide to them, nothing will happen.  Nothing will happen. As the Honourable Chairperson would have noticed in many instances in this country things got right only after the courts decided on that, because people don’t want to do what they are supposed to do.     That is true Chairperson.   Just to return to the point that was made by Counsel, yes indeed if and what the Chairperson is saying now, if indeed people who go to Parliament understand that they are public representatives they might have gotten in there using a party ticket, but once they are in Parliament they are not representing sectarian interest of a party, they represent those ordinary men and women in the villages, in the townships, on the farms, who are poor, they have become the voice of the people because those people cannot be there at Parliament in their millions, so they must make sure that what they say there and what they decide correctly reflect the experiences of the people that they claim to represent, so it is important to do that, and I do think that as Counsel says that if we have more and more of such people our democracy will function better, because it would mean even the most powerful of the parties will not take for granted the support of the voters, they would know that the voters will learn something further by listening to the opposition because the opposition is talking to those things that are touching their souls and their hearts.     Now?     I am happy to continue until we finish Chair.     I will talk less going forward.     Oh, okay sorry.  Okay.     “It was strange to me ... ...[intervenes]      Oh. “Moreover, this requirement only emerged as more and more corruption was exposed, particularly Mr Osler Mashaba revealed that 18million had been paid to individuals who claimed to be collecting the funds on behalf of the government party.    Oh the same bundle okay.    Okay    I got it.  I got it.    I see yes.    That is correct Chairperson.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.    The – the case that we were making was one of asking the court to consider and set aside the arbitration step in the – in the contract between Swifambo and PRASA.  And the reason we wanted that set aside and us proceeding immediately for the application to set aside the contract on the basis that it actually never existed.  It was invalid at the initial because certain conditions which should have been met were not met.  And it was our view that time that if we were to go the – you go the route of arbitration.  If you disagree about elements of the contract but you – you do not accept that the contract exists but in this instance we were saying it does not exist so there should not be a need for arbitration but of course you cannot just exclude it unless the court set it aside.    In the Swifambo matter?    And it is not this one this is a reply.    So why do we not go to the founding one?    It makes it difficult.    Because I will not remember.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Let me understand.  In that case the issue was the contract is not valid.    Probably then the lawyers would have held that to go into the details about Mashaba does not prove anything with regard to that.    It is true and the court did not deal with it.    Yes.    That is correct.    That – that is correct.    That is correct.    He did not – he did not – he – that day he did not have any documents.   Any documents…[intervenes]    It was made for him to provide it to Mamabolo.    Who duly collected it and brought it to me.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    Hm that is true, that is what I did.  Because I was not going to be able to do anything with what he just told me verbally.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well I understood it to be payment and I understood that the recordings of payments and loaned was merely for purposes of bookkeeping and auditing.    He was in the meeting.    No when – Chairperson when in a meeting where I was present and my – and Mr Mashaba was present and Ms Matlala he said that he paid these monies to these people and I say the names Maria Gomez and her company.    And Sabelo Nkosi – Nkosi Sabelo.    And Knowles Husain. I think Sabelo was working for Knowles Husain when I tried to remember the company.    And he was with that firm.    So I understood it be payments not loans.    That is correct Chairperson.    285?    Well it appears obviously it is an invoice.    From – from Similex was a company owned by Ms Gomez.    Maria Gomez.    But there is no 285 here.    Oh is this 286 yes.    Similex.    Okay page 285.  Oh 285 is there.  Okay.    Okay.    So this is an invoice.    It is an invoice Chairperson.    It is an invoice from Similex to AM Consulting Engineers.  Now AM Consulting Engineers is a company of Mr Mashaba.    That AM stands for Auswell Mashaba.    Was a company owned by Maria Gomez.    Yes.    The directors are Maria Cruz Gomez and Domingos Gomez.  I think Domingos Gomez is her husband.    That is so.    Yes I do Chairperson    The description of services it says service rendered IRPTM planning and planning development.    And implementation.    I can see a 30% of the total amount.    Oh 283.    I am going to do so Chairperson.    The – there is one payee there Similex.    And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.    Appears 5 times and then of course there are only the dates written there was on the 6 May 2014, 20 of January 2014, 10 January 2014.  The other part does not have the dates.    That is correct.    I can see that.    That is correct Chairperson, it is so, a similar amount.    It does say on the 10 t h of January.    But this – well you know this one is an invoice.      Issued on the 1 s t of January, nine days later it got paid.    Yes.    287 the document is again an invoice from Simulax.    It is addressed to A M Consulting Engineers.    Yes.    Okay.    That is correct Chairperson.    And that was paid on the 20 t h of January.     That is correct.     There is no correlation.     290.     No, my recollection is that Mamabolo did not have the invoices, he had the schedule of payments.     I think these invoices came as a result of the investigations.     Simply from the schedule.     285?     It is a letter of Mashaba.     Well it could be so, but when we investigate, when we investigate the banks are obliged to ...[intervenes]      So when this letter of authority comes from Mr Mashaba and he is telling his banker to pay, to pay Mr Husain ...[intervenes]       I think it came through the investigation Chairperson, it certainly was not in the document that Mashaba gave, Mashaba gave me that schedule only.     Which I gave to the investigators.     264?     The one I took from him personally was the schedule, but he would have been working with the investigator since we have so some of those documents could have been given directly to the investigators.     I honestly don’t have a recollection of seeing every invoice.     The envelope would have been given to my lawyers.     And I remember seeing the statement, because I discussed again after that.     That will be fine Chairperson.     No I am worried about the figures, you see at page ...[intervenes]      It will be fine Chairperson.     Thanks Chairperson. 
ADV SONI SC:  Thank you Mr Chairperson I would like to place according to…(microphone off).    Sorry Chairperson.  That is according to the advice we have received as well Mr Chairperson.   Mr Molefe (intervention).    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Chairperson you will recall that the last issue that we canvassed with Mr Molefe was the meeting on the 20 August 2015 at which former President Zuma attempted to persuade Mr Molefe to ask his board to take Mr Montana back after he had resigned and this was about six weeks after he had left the organisation on the 15 July 2015.  Then you will also recall Mr Chairperson that Mr Molefe in dealing with that matter dealt with a meeting that he had held with the top six asking them to create some semblance of normality at PRASA on account of the attacks that Mr Montana had been making against Mr Molefe and the board.    Mr Chairperson may I ask if I can just really briefly deal with that matter because you will recall that one of the questions I asked and you also asked Mr Chairperson was whether it – it made sense that the board was being asked to take Mr Montana back given the background circumstances of which everybody knew.  And you will recall that Mr Molefe said that it had been widely reported in the media.  We have since then Mr Chairperson and we have augmented the file and at pages 222 to page 258…    Oh sorry yes Mr Chairperson.    Yes.  It will – Bundle D Exhibit SS6.    So this is the articles are at 222 to 258 Mr Chairperson.    That – that is so Chairperson yes.    That is so.      The – the articles themselves are not.    Chairperson.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    In the media, yes.    Chairperson can I…    It will be done.    Mr Chairperson because with respect it – you are absolutely right that is how it should have been done.    I did not…    Yes.    I apologise Chairperson.    Yes.  Yes Chairperson.  Chairperson may I say in regard to the articles.    Yes.    Chairperson the – it is not my intention in referring to the articles to go into any depth.  The idea is merely again to emphasise the point that it just made no sense and it was in the public arena that there was this incompatibility between Mr Montana and the board.    Yes.    Absolutely.    Yes.    Mr Molefe.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And – and Chairperson with respect the – it was not just allegations of small corruption this was billions of rands.  For example among…    So – so perhaps I should ask Mr Molefe whether he would like time to look at it.    Or he can talk about it now.    Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Molefe, may I just say that I am pleased you raised the issue of right at the end connecting all the dots because I just want to make this comment before we go on with the rest of your evidence.   You are in a unique position, as I see it, you have the communication with the President in regard to the matters you have described already which does not make too much sense and we have debated that.   Then your board is dismissed.  As you have said, instead of parliament exercising oversight over the minister, the minister goes to the portfolio committee and announces the dissolvement of the board before then and she is not asked why did you do – I want to raise all those things.   And then you go to the police and say but look, we have got people who are involved in fraud amounting to billions of rands and they do nothing about it.   That is all contained in here and so I am pleased you have raised this question because I was going to do that but I am pleased in the sense you have also looked at the big picture. But before we go on with your evidence, there are three matters I want to raise with you in relation to what you have said this morning.   You said the matter – one of the matters went to the CC, that is the Swifambo matter, am I right?     And we have been through the fact that both the High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal said there was corruption and they fingered two people, Mr Montana and Mr Mtimkulu and I mention them because you mention them later in your evidence. The second thing I want to ask you was, earlier on you said that the former Chairperson of the board wanted to hasten the Braamfontein tender.  Do you recall saying that a little while ago?     Who is the Chairperson because, I mean, I know – I just wanted a name to it.     Mr Sifiso Buthelezi.     And he, at the same time that Mr Montana said he was leaving right at the outset of your tenure as Chairperson, he also told you he was resigning from the board.     So he was pushing this through before he left the board?     No, I understand.  Finally, at the meeting of the 20 August, Minister Dipuo Peters asked Minister Radebe about the PRASA internal report.  Asked for a copy of the report.     Now on your understanding, Minister Radebe had the report because it was addressed to him.     When Minister Dipuo Peters asked for the report what was Minister Radebe’s response?     Did that surprise you?     I take it before the meeting you would have told Minister Peters about this report.     Finally, in regard to the report, Mr Molefe, I reiterate the invitation of the Chairperson to make use of facilities at the Commission.  I am confident that if you gave them the laptop or computer where that was, they would find it.     It has taken a long time to get here, Mr Molefe, but may I then ask that we go back to …[intervenes]     No, no, no, sorry, we have been asking questions outside the ambit because, as the Chairperson pointed out, this is pivotal to the work of the Commission.     Certainly in regard to PRASA.  Can I then ask, you have this meeting with the President and in the next topic you discuss is the dismissal of the board.  Now can you tell us – we know that on the 8 March 2017 the Minister dismissed the board.     Yes.     I was hoping that I would use the key interval to pick out about five of the articles.     But I could do it now, it is just that it may take a little longer because I could identify …[intervenes]     So we know that the Minister on the 8 March 2017 purported to dismiss the board and I say purported because that dismissal was set aside.  But what were the reasons that led to that decision?  You deal with from paragraph 93 of your affidavit, Mr Molefe.     Paragraph 93, Chairperson, page 24.     Well, it starts off with the question of appointing a replacement for Mr Montana after he left on the 15 July 2015.     Yes.  Well, ja, and what were the circumstances leading up to it.    [throat clearing]  Mister [throat clearing] Molefe, can I just go back to an issue you said or you suggested what the game plan was, that they would frustrate the appointment of a Group CEO and then eventually Montana would come back as the Group CEO.  That is... that is what you said.    Yes?    H’m.    [throat clearing]  Mr Molefe, I do not know if you were here when Mr Holele gave evidence.  And... and just to come back to the point that they wanted to appoint mister uh, Mr Montana again.    Where is mine?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    [laughs]    As it please.    Yes. [laugh]    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you, Chairperson.    Mr Chairperson, may I ask one question relation to that issue which um, may assist you in joining the dots?    Mr Molefe, I do not know if you were here when Mr Tiro Holele gave evidence.  His evidence was in around February/March in 2017 when they refused to pay an account from Prodigy, which is a company which Mr Roy Moodley has an interest in. He asked them to pay the account and when they said, “take it to court”, his answer was “well, there are big changes coming and that young man is coming back.  Be careful you are not on the wrong side of history”. So I am just putting it in the context of you are saying that they wanted Mr Montana back.      Uh, I... I am putting that in context to say your theory may not be all that farfetched.    You... you will recall Mr Chairperson that uh, Mr Holele and Mr Letsoalo gave evidence that that is what Mr Moodley said to them when they had refused to pay but the matter is court.    27 February.    ...March 2017.    Um, if I could just put it also in context?  They said, “changes are coming” and three weeks later, there was a change in the ministry and the Minister uh, Dipuo Peters was removed as Minister of Transport.    Ja.    Yes.    That is... yes.    Yes.    H’m...[intervenes]     On the 8t h of March.     2017.    Uh, February/March 2017.    She was... [laughs]    But... but... uh, um, Mr Molefe’s evidence is partly with the change in that evidence.    Just one other issue relating to Mr Moodley.  When you gave your evidence on the previous occasion, Mr Molefe.  You say that Mr Moodley and Mr Montana had met or you had been told by the... MECHANICAL INTERRUPTION INQUIRY RESUMES     Sorry, again for context Mr Molefe may I say that at the meeting of the 20 t h of August you understood that Mr Roy Moodley and Mr Montana had been with the President before you and the Minister were called.     So let us now get to the resolution of – oh sorry before we do that, you say that Mr Letsoalo was unhappy about the Werksmans Investigations…[intervenes].     I want to do it because in the application that is brought the Judge deals with that, then.     So, if I could just ask – there was unhappiness about the Werksmans investigation by the Action CEO whom the Minister had installed, will that be correct Mr Molefe?     Then on the 12 t h of August you say that Minister Peters herself, wrote to you to suggest that the investigations be stopped.     And that appears at Annexure PM7, your affidavit at page 154.     Yes the letter from Minister Dipuo Peters is Annexure PM7 and it appears at page 154 of Bundle D, Exhibit SS6.     154, Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes, we don’t have to read the whole – if you could explain to the Chairperson what the gist of the letter is Mr Molefe?     The previous page Mr Molefe.     Right at the end at the bottom of that page.     Yes, should you not read that entire the paragraph into the record?     Now…[intervenes].     Is that correct?     You responded to that letter?     And what is the date of your response?     And is that the letter or is that Annexure PM8 which is at 157 – page 157?     Now in your report, if you could – I mean in your response if you could summarise what you said to the Minister, Mr Molefe?     Then the – then you deal with each of the concerns in paragraph 1 on page 159 you say that the investigation, contrary to what the Minister says, was not irregular, is that the essence of paragraph 1?     Then you deal with her concerns about the scope with the investigation in paragraph 2 you say, the scope had been determined in the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 2 by matters that had been identified by the Auditor General and in the second sub-paragraph you say the matters raised by the Public Protector, would that be correct?     And then you make the point that it is the Public Protector who had required that all contracts above R10million should be investigated.     And that, in the pursuit of those investigations the – PRASA had embarked on litigation, you say that at paragraph 160 you say that…[intervenes].     Yes, the litigation that has flowed from the investigation requires the assistance of forensic investigation team.     And you make the point that, ironically, it is those very people who benefit from – benefitted from the unlawful activities who are using those unlawful proceeds to fight PRASA with.     And then you make the point that, right at the end of page 160, that Siyagena had benefited to the tune of R800million and that it had also sought a guarantee, on page 161, of R1.1billion.     And at that stage had the Siyagena review proceedings been instituted?     [intervenes], year 2016.     Mr Molefe Ms Ngoyi’s evidence is this is, that after the review proceedings, the first review proceedings were instituted in 2016, in response Siyagena brought an interdict requiring payment of this money and that was the first time that it had been discovered that there was such a contract, that addendum for R800million, is that what you’re referring to?     And that is a contract that was signed by Mr Montana at the end of September 2014, is that your recollection?     Sorry, Chairperson, when we deal with Ms – when we continue with Ms Ngoyi’s evidence we will produce that document.     When we produce – when we lead Ms Ngoyi’s further evidence that will be one of the documents to which she will be referred.    Mr Chairperson I just wonder if I can ask the witness to confirm because it may be important Bongani has managed to locate a document that may well be the document that the witness was talking about.    I just want to show the witness.    Because then we can run out copies.    Yes.  Yes.    We thought once we have got the copies, we will be able to…    Yes.    It – oh it is a big find Chairperson.    Ms Molefe is there anything else in your let – oh and there is just one part of your letter that I want to refer to and that is at 165 where after all those bullet points in the middle of that letter you say, the Board does not have any reason to stop the investigation at this point and is satisfied that stopping the investigation will be harmful to PRASA.  That is the stance of the Board would I be correct?    Oh sorry, sorry please do I do not want to…    Yes.  It is a…    Yes.    Yes.   The – and you are quite right Mr Molefe that is an important point but the point I wanted to make is that when you say the Board does not have a reason what you are saying to the Minister is in terms of Section 50 and 51 of the PFMA.    The Board must act according to its own conscience and its own belief and its own understanding about its responsibilities and cannot take instructions from even the Minister.  That – would I be encapsulating that problem?    And you have mentioned that point    And one of the values that the constitution imposes on all repositories of power.    Is that they must exercise power in an accountable manner.  That is exactly what you were saying to the Minister.    And then you say right at the end of that paragraph – at the – sorry perhaps you should read the next paragraph because this goes to the state of knowledge of the Minister where you say we have endeavoured.  If you could read that into the record Mr Molefe.    Yes.    Yes.    Now what – sorry you wanted to say something.    Sorry I was going to ask a question but I – I understood that the witness want – no, no please Mr Molefe you…    Now the matter that you referred to the investigation was this Swifambo investigation, would that be correct?    Now that is the one where the Supreme Court of Appeal and the High Court said there was corruption and the Constitutional Court refused to grant Leave to Appeal against the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeal?    Then – well not soon thereafter this was in the August 24 the next milestone that happened is the Minister dissolves the Board.    You say that she dissolves the Board on the 8 March.  Now when she dissolved the Board did she give any reasons?    Mr Molefe again just expanding on the theme raised by the Chairperson the Minister and – well through the DG, acting DG announces the dismissal of the Board on the occasion at which the Board was appearing before the Portfolio Committee.    Now as I understand it you did not go to that meeting but the rest of the Board members went?    And that is quite an expensive…    Sorry.    But that is quite an expensive business to the Portfolio Committee from Pretoria in Cape Town.    Now if the Minister was dismissing the Board and had reflected on this one would imagine that she would have done it before the Portfolio Committee actually met because that would have saved that expense     I want to just raise a – Chairperson, you have raised something that I have not thought about and I had not asked the witness to think about but perhaps we could raise it because the witness has mentioned two letters that he had written, one to the Speaker of Parliament and the other to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee.  Certainly the letter to the Speaker of Parliament is dated the same day as they are dismissed and it may be after the witness has looked at it, he can reflect again as to whether there is a connection between the timing of the dismissal and the issues you have raised.  It has only occurred to me now, Chairperson, but if there is something that I submit needs to be considered.     Indeed.     Indeed.     Yes.     Clear publicity.     Yes.     As you please, Chair.     Mr Chair, may I place on record that we have now retrieved that document and I would like Mr Motlana to hand it up.  I mean, Mr Molefe, to hand it up.     PRASA in Turmoil.     Yes.     One of the headings is PRASA in Turmoil.     One of the headings in the report is PRASA Internal.     One of the headings.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     So, Chairperson, just for the order we …[intervenes]     Oh, sorry.     So, I was …[intervenes]     Yes.     That is so, Chair.     Yes.  We could call it as you suggest, Chairperson, PRASA in Turmoil and we could …[intervenes]     Yes, yes.     Yes.     And we could include it at the end of …[intervenes]     Yes.     He can identify it first, Chairperson.     Mr Molefe, you have been referring to a document produced by Mr Montana.     And you referred to it in general terms as a document called PRASA in Turmoil.     Is this the document?     Yes and then the last page …[intervenes]     Yes.     Right at the end you will see it at the bottom.     Let me just find…     Yes, yes.     It may be a good idea, Chairperson, to have it as a separate document.     Yes because I have no doubt it will come up again.     Shall we make this EXHIBIT SS6A?     SS6 - Mr Molefe’s affidavit is SS6 and we can make this 6A.     There is already a 7, as I understand it.     Yes.  I will just check.     Oh, yes.     Yes.  Yes, it does, Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Talking about, yes.     Can we refer to this a little later?     I will lead Mr Molefe on it a little later.     Now, Mr Molefe, we were still dealing with the dismissal by the Minister of the board on the 8 March.  When the Minister announced her decision, what was your reaction to it?  I am talking about active reaction in relation to her decision.  But perhaps let me ask more directly.  Did you challenge the decision?     Yes.  You then took the decision to quote …[intervenes]     I place on record, Chairperson, that the DG’s letter is something we have only heard about this morning for the first time.  I had thought until this morning that the Minister had announced it at the Portfolio Committee but that letter is not part of the documents before you, Chairperson.     No.     No.     Well, did she give any reasons at the time she dismissed you, Mr Molefe?     They are quite revealing, Chairperson, that is why I think Mr Molefe cannot give an answer.  I will refer you to a paragraph of the judgment.     Which addresses this very issue.     But what happens in court actually explains in a sense the fact that no reasons were given.     Okay.  So, Mr Molefe, may I ask you to look at bundle A and it is the judgment of the court in the matter …[intervenes]     Chairperson, it is bundle A.     That is right, yes.  SS2, Chairperson.     Page 83, that is where the judgments are.  The report starts page 83 and you will see, Chairperson, it has Mr Molefe and the other board members against the Minister of Transport and members of a newly appointed board.     At page 83, Chairperson.     Yes.      Yes.     Yes.,     Of SS2.     Yes.     Now, Mr Molefe, can I ask you in respect of that judgment, could you turn to page 124, paragraph 51?     51, Chairperson.     Yes.     Now in the earlier paragraphs the judge deals with the duty to give reasons for administrative action and then at paragraph 51 he sets out what reasons were given.  Could you read that into the record please?     Okay, if you could just stop there.  Was that the first time you heard the justification for the dismissal of the board on the 13 t h?     Yes, so …[intervenes]     So you were dismissed on the 8 t h but the first time you were given a reason so to speak was on the 13 t h?     Yes.     And not talking to...     As emphasised by the judge.     By the judge, Chairperson.     And then in the next – then the judge says what she had said in her answering affidavit.  Could you read that into the record?     Mr Chair, Mr Molefe, can I ask you to turn to paragraph 56?     It is slightly warmer.     So this, Mr Molefe, is after the judge decides that she was setting aside her decision and this is     Okay, you can stop there.  Can I then ask you to look at paragraph 60?  If you could just read the first sentence?       Yes.  And then if you look at page 135, paragraph 3, the court sets aside the decision to remove the members of the board and in paragraph 6 orders the Minister to pay the costs, is that correct?     Now after the – after you took the decision to court but before the decision of the court, the change and they have already discussed it, where Minister Peters was removed as Minister of Transport and Mr Joe Maswanganyi was appointed minister.  Is that correct?    Yes.    Now, what has Minister Maswanganyi’s uh, approach towards the board?  The... uh, Minister Peters had dismissed the board.  You had been reinstated.  What was his approach to your reinstatement and your continued existence as a board?    I was just going to that Chairperson.    It is here now.    Yes, Chairperson.    Mr Molefe, can I ask you to look at page 176 which is Annexure PM10 to your affidavit?    Oh, sorry.  We are going to bundle...    Yes, yes...[intervenes]     And how...[intervenes]     On page 170, Chairperson.    Page 25...[intervenes]     And then Annexure PM10 is page 170.      Yes.    So this is the minister’s letter to the board in which he gives notice that he intends dismissing the board and asks you to make representations why you should not.    Now, in fact, we are just looking forward.  The... he did not go uh, ahead with his threat to... to terminate the... the board or... or the cleaning of the board.    Yes, Chair?    Oh.    You are quite right. [laugh]      I must have missed... I did not see that.    If you look at paragraph 99 of your affidavit uh, Mr Molefe at page 25, you will see you give a date there.    Page 25 of your affidavit, paragraph 99.    No, your affidavit here uh, Mr Molefe.    Oh.    Page 25, paragraph 99.    And you then responded through PM10 which appears at... ah, sorry.  Through PM11 which appears at page 179.    And in essence, again because that much happened as a result of this, you asked for more time so that you could give a more considered response to his invitation?    Now, he did not go ahead with the threat to terminate the chairman of the board but you said he achieved the same result through a different means.  What do you mean by that?    Ms Molefe, there you make a slightly different point that in the second sentence at paragraph 100, you say,  “I later found out that the directors were lobbied to resigned from their respective positions on the board”.   Who...[intervenes]     Sorry, Chairperson.      Page 25.    Paragraph a hundred.    Are you there Mr Molefe?    Page 25, paragraph 100, the second sentence.    Yes.    So that it is on record.  Okay, Chairperson.    What the Chairperson has said is... goes back thousands of years in Ancient Rome when Caesar’s    Oh, sorry.      Sorry.    What he says, “I killed him because I love Rome more than I love Caesar”.  And that is exactly the point you are making Chairperson.    It is what human nature needs to go beyond.  But let me... Mr Molefe, when I check at another thing raised by the Chairperson.  The Chairperson pointed out that it was important for a board to function because it has been such an important job in the R 173 billion enterprise. Now, everybody knows that the term of the board was going to end on the 31s t of July.  Where there any attempts made to fill the vacancies that would arise on the 31s t of July?    Now...[intervenes]     Now at... at... why the level uh, Mr Molefe.  The minister, the previous Minister Dipuo Peters, dismisses the board on the 8 t h of March.  It is quite clear that they do not want the board.  Then the Minister Maswanganyi, he comes.  He says, “please tell me why I should not dismiss you?”  So it is quite clear that the powers that be did not want your board.  But...[intervenes]     ...they want you to further a gap.  Wants to appoint a new board.  Have you any idea why they did not put any steps in place, and as you have pointed out earlier five and a half years later, we still do not have a permanent board?     Mr Molefe on a number of occasions you’ve referred to the Swifambo matter, you remember?    Now I just want to point out, Mr Chairman, I don’t need to take either the witness or you there, that in fact, the judgement in the High Court in the Swifambo matter was handed down on the 3 r d of July 17…[intervenes].     It’s about the time that all of these things were coming out and the significance of that will come out in later evidence as Molefe is going to testify.     But that date is important Chairperson because you would think that where a Board has saved the country R3.5billion there would be a reward in terms of, do further service for the country but they are snuffed out as Mr Molefe says by getting people not continue serving on the Board,     But that is – seems to be the pattern.     Now, your Board’s term of office ended then in July.     And – because you were not re-appointed and were any of the other – well were any of the other Board members appointed to any of the intern Boards?     To the intern Board.     Now, Mr Molefe can we go on – we’ve now dealt with the Minister or firstly we dealt with the President then the Minister. On a number of occasions, you’ve mentioned Parliament and the Portfolio Committee, what steps did you make to secure protection for your Board from Parliament and/or the Portfolio Committee. MR     And about when was that meeting, did those two gentlemen come to you?     So just more or less about the time he came because he was appointed the end of March?     Now, Mr Molefe, just before we finish with the need for a Board are you aware that in terms of the PFMA, every public entity must have a Board of control because that is the Accounting Authority for that public entity?     And was this ever discussed at any time in your meetings with either of the Ministers, Minister Dipuo Peters or Minister Maswanganyi?     Sir I don’t want to flog the point but this is what concerns me, you earlier said that the PRASA Act doesn’t make provision for an interim Board.     So, they must have known that what they are doing is not in compliance with the law but they’ve done so for five and a half years.  I’m just emphasising the point that, that’s the extent to which your Board appears to have irritated them at the very least.     Mr Molefe, can we then go on to the issue I raised with you about your approach to Parliament.  Now, we know you approached the Speaker of Parliament and you did so in writing, is that correct?     And the letter that you wrote to her is Annexure PM12 to your affidavit, it appears at Bundle D, page 183, is that correct?     Now, in essence, what did you want Ms Mbete to do in her capacity as Chairperson of – I mean as Speaker of Parliament?     Now, I see that letter, if you look at page 183, that letter was copied to the Chairperson of SCOPA, the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Transport, the Chief Whips of SCOPA and the Chief Whips of the Portfolio Committee.     Now, in support of your request for a public inquiry or Parliamentary inquiry you raise a number of points in paragraph 5, in essence, what were you saying to Ms Mbete?     In light of the fact that not much came out but if you could just indicate because we just want to know what is it that was brought to her attention?     And then you make mention in paragraph 6 about comments made by members of the Portfolio Committee on the 7 and 8 March that year.     So based on that you formally asked for a parliamentary inquiry into the affairs of PRASA?     What was the reaction to this letter?     But save for that there was no response and nothing active was done to  - from parliament’s side to probe PRASA.     Then you also on the same day, this is the 8 March, you wrote to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Transport and that letter is at page 187 and it is marked annexure PM13, is that correct?     Now in this letter you mention a number of points which are similar to the points that you make to the     Sorry, paragraph 5 on page 188,     Can you indicate what you said to the Portfolio Committee as to the steps the board had taken?  If you could just summarise that?     Mr Molefe, I suppose what I am trying to do and can I just make my point.  On that same day you wrote to the Speaker and you wrote to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee.   To the Speaker you say hold an inquiry into PRASA but to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee it appears that the purpose of your report is to say given all that I have indicated to you that we have done, you ought to treat us with more respect and you say that at paragraph 9.   Would that – I am just trying to draw a distinction between the two letters where the purpose of – or the differences between the purposes of the two letters.     Yes, yes, yes.     Mr Chairperson, you are quite correct, it is important that this letter is on record.  I was trying to short circuit but I think it was led by …[intervenes]     Absolutely.     No, but with respect, Chairperson, that is the balance I should have struck.     Let him read the letter.     No to this letter did you get any response, Mr Molefe? MR     So the ball …[intervenes]     Now, Mr Molefe, in your letter to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee you talk about the meeting of the 7 t h and 8 t h of 2017 – 7 t h and 8 t h March 2017.  But in your affidavit, you then go on to say but that is how throughout our tenure as board members we had been treated and I would like you to deal with that because you deal with it from paragraph 105 of your affidavit.  Or if you could just from recollection indicate to the Chairperson that what happened at that meeting was not something new to us.     No, that you cannot do because this is going to be an important part of your evidence.     Yes, now you then say that at paragraph 111 that you were concerned and you used some strong language, could you read that into the record what you say at paragraph 111?     Now you mentioned that they even asked for the investigators, namely Werksmans Attorneys, to be subjected to an SAA vetting.     And you say that that is the first time that any investigator had been subjected to that requirement.     Then the last line of paragraph 112 you say you link it, this requirement to certain regulations where you tell the Chairperson what those regulations are.     Then could you read from the last line of paragraph 112 on page 27, the word starting moreover this requirement of the SSA investigation.      Yes please, just from the last line onto the next page.      Sorry the sentence continues on the next page.      Perhaps you should read that sentence again, it is quite key Mr Molefe.      No, no, no starting with “moreover”.      Now can I ask you where did you get that information from that Mr Mashaba, Mashaba had collected R18million for the governing party?  Mr – also Mashaba well of course the investigation was reported in the media and everywhere but he began to worry.  He apparently became suspicious that he – he was being investigated.  He knew it had to be because he was part of Swifambo, he was the Chairman of Swifambo that is a company that got that big contract for the locomotives.  He sent someone to approach a certain Mr Philemon Mamabolo who worked for PRASA in the security division mainly in the business investigations unit.  I think that is what that DIU stands for.  And he said he wanted to meet with the Chairman of the Board of PRASA – oh this individual who was unknown advised Mamabolo that Mashaba wants to meet with him.  So they met with Mamabolo somewhere in Pretoria in an Italian restaurant.  At that meeting he told him that he believed that he was being investigated and he was worried that he might lose all the assets that he had accumulated working hard for.  And he did not want to lose what he had as a result of the contract of Swifambo.  He was a man who was running like filling stations.  He had all kinds of things and he had an engineering consulting business AM Engineering.  So he wanted to meet with me as the Chairman of the Board so Mamabolo asked me, I agreed to meet with him.  We met in Sandton at the Maslow Hotel.  I had asked one of our directors Ms Matlala, Sheila Matlala to accompany me and so it was Mr Mamabolo.  Mashaba came and he repeated what he had told Mamabolo to say that he is worried that he might lose everything that he has and he really is begging that we should not take whatever he asks.  He worked hard for which had nothing to do with Swifambo and he said that he – he actually had not known the founder of Swifambo before.  The founder of Swifambo was Makhensa Mabunda or Mabunda Makhensa.  Makhensa had approached him and asked him to join him become a director of Swifambo and become a Chairman thereof that there was a tender opportunity at PRASA for the locomotives.  He wants them to bid for that tender.  So – so he goes on and Mashaba of course had agreed.  But Mashaba says, I am prepared to co-operate provided you guys will not take my assets.  So he starts telling us a story about the various people whom he paid money to and as he was talking I said, look I do not think I want to go around saying you paid money to people unless you can demonstrate by way of bank deposits that you actually paid money to these people and give us the names of those people or their companies and so on.  So he said he did not have the documents but he – he could make them available.  And when he made the documents that is how we got to know about this R80 million.  He did say that there were other monies that he paid.  I think he paid another R90 000.00 and he paid another R1 050 000.00 but those monies he said he did not have proof because he was – he was giving cash.  Now who are the individuals he was paying money to?  One of them was a person who was born in Angola, a lady called Maria Gomez.  She ran a company called, I think it was called Similex and then the other one was an attorney George Sabelo.  I think at the time Sabelo was working for I think Bowmans.  I cannot remember exactly.  So – so these are the monies I cannot remember the rest of the monies but they are paying quite a number of companies.  I dealt with those details in one of the applications in the Swifambo Application when I was still the Director of PRASA.      Can I just in reference to what you have just said your evidence in the Swifambo matter by way of affidavit.  May I ask you to look at Bundle D page 259?      It is the same bundle in the…    Yes.    So Mr Molefe have you got it?    The title of the document is a replying affidavit, do you see that?    Now I am just pointing out so that we can put it in context.  This is your replying affidavit in the Swifambo matter, would that be correct?    We did not include the whole replying affidavit we just included the parts relating to the matters you have dealt with now.  But can I ask you in your founding affidavit…    Sorry.    As you please.    Now in – in your replying – in your founding affidavit you did not raise this issue about Mr Mashaba’s telling you about the payment of funds.  Is that correct?    Because that is a complaint he makes.    Yes.  Sorry.  You recall the case that was made out in the original – well in the founding affidavit in the Swifambo matter Mr Molefe?    The – I am making a slightly different point.  In your original – in your founding affidavit you did…    Yes in the Swifambo matter.    This is your replying affidavit.    No, no Mr…    No, no.    Mr Molefe when you first gave evidence.    We went through the judgment of Justice Francis.  We went through the judgment of Justice Lewis.    You remember?    Because they think that this was corrupt.  Mr Mthimkhulu so called Doctor Mthimkhulu had set aside – had tailor made the contract for Swifambo.    Do you remember it?    So this matter that you are raising now was not raised in that.  But you do raise it in the replying affidavit.  The only reason that is important is – because I want to go to Mr Mashaba’s response to what you say which is also included in these papers.    I am just trying to orientate you.    So that we can deal with your evidence in a systematic way.    Yes.  And that is what the court found.    I am not criticising.    Yes.    Yes.  So you – but in your replying affidavit you dealt with this piece of evidence you now linked today to say Mr Mashaba had approached you to say, please come to my rescue, do not take away all my – all my assets.  Remember you said that a little earlier?    Yes.  So is it correct that when you look at paragraph 9 of your affidavit what you have said today is a summary of what is contained in paragraph 9 of your affidavit.    In other words, you have dealt with how the – the approach was made to you through Mr Mamabolo and Mr Mamabolo and what happened at the Maslow Restaurant.    There is just one thing though that I want to deal with is the payment schedule that he gave to you and you found that at page 283.    283.    Yes. Now is the document at page 283 the document that he gave to Mr Mamabolo?    And…    283 Chair yes.    Is that a schedule of payments made – well that he said he had made?    This is….    Yes.    That is – that is – yes Chairperson.    Now the Chairperson is raising an important issue is he at the meeting had said to you that he will send a schedule of payments he had made.  Because you said, but look you telling me that you have paid these people but where is the proof of payment?    Ja.  Now he then sent you this document but as the Chairperson points out this does not say Schedule of Payments it says Loan Payments.  Do you see that?    But that is what the document is headed.    What did you understand notwithstanding what the documents – what the document is headed?    Then can I ask you to please look at page 285.    Yes.  What is that document?    Yes.    Yes.    I was trying – but I could do that Chairperson.    Yes.  It answers the question whether it was a loan.    Or …    So if you look at 285 what is that document there Mr Molefe on the face of it?    From whom?    Yes.    If you look just under the – the heading of that document.    It says directors.    No I..    No you are absolutely right Chairperson.  Because it is in I guess middle misread the 5 – I misread the 6 for the 5.    But it is 286 I am sorry.    286.    No that is the document.    Sorry Chairperson.    Okay we are dealing with 286.  What is the document at 286?    Yes.    From whom to whom?    And you will see that Mr Molefe if you look under Similex the name Similex it tells you who the directors are, you see that?  Right at the top.    And who are the directors?    Yes.    Yes.    Do you see that Mr Molefe?    Now I just want to go back now to page 283 with this…    Yes.  So if you look at the schedule that we looked at there at page 283 you will see that amount has been reflected in the third line of the payments.  Do you see that?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    It is so Chairperson.    Yes, yes.    That is so yes Chairperson.    Yes.    So comparing the – the payments or the invoice against the payment if you look at the invoice at page 286 it is dated the 1 s t of January, although it says 1 t h instead of saying 1 s t, first, “st” it says 1th, do you see that?     Yes.  Do you see that Mr Molefe?     What page are we looking at?     At page 286.     Yes so the amount that was paid on that or the amount of the invoice was R14 100 000, do you see that?     If you compare the payments as they appear on page 283 do you see a similar payment made in the third line?     And it says that that payment was made on the 10 t h of January, on that page, on page 283.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, I am just trying to compare the fact that there was an invoice for that amount and payment for that amount was made?     Then if you look at page 287 what is that document?     And addressed to?     Yes it is from the same company to the same company.     And what is the amount ...[intervenes]      Sorry, sorry Chair.     Yes.     As it pleases.     Can I then ask you to look again at page 283, the amount paid as reflected on the second line is for an amount of R14 500 000.  It is on the second line now Mr Molefe.     That is not ...[intervenes]      That was paid on the 20 t h of January.  So it is not for the same amount of that invoice, because the invoice is for R16 450 000, the amount that appears there is R14 500 00.     There is no correlation between those two?     Can I ask you then to look at page 290.     Yes.     I will clarify that.     So where did you get these invoices from?     Oh so they were affected from the ...[intervenes]      And so is the proof of payment in regard to all of them those were not given by Mr Mashaba?  So if you look at page 285 for example the letter of authority, they were not given by Mr Mashaba to Mr Mamabolo     Yes.     No it is – you will recall Chairperson I made a mistake I said 286 was 285.     I am asking was this document – or sorry – what is the source of this document, because as I understand it now, and I misunderstood, that this payment schedule is the only document that Mr Mashaba gave to Mr Mamabolo or am I wrong?     Can I just ask you to look at page 264 which is part of your affidavit.  Okay very quickly Mr Molefe at paragraph 9.3 ...[intervenes]      Yes, which is part of your replying affidavit, you say on or about the 2 n d of September Mr Mamabolo collected the documents from Mr Mashaba and this is the whole set of documents that you say he collected.       Yes, no that is so.     Now the documents I am just putting to you generally Mr Molefe, except for the difference between – you sort of seem to be worried about ...[intervenes]     Chairperson it seems it has been a long day for the witness and I proposed to him that it may be better if he slept over this issue and we dealt with it first thing in the morning, which would allow us to deal with it quicker and let him be more at ease.  Mr Molefe is more than happy to do that as I understand.     We will just go factor in the issue that Mr Molefe raised right at the end ...[intervenes]     But this part won’t take much, much longer.    As you please. 
REGISTRAR:  Please place your full names for the record?    Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?    Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God. 
COURT ORDERLY:   All rise.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES 
MOLEFE:  Of the seriousness of the levels of corruption.    To reach to Parliament the Portfolio Committee on Transport a letter – the announcement that the Board has been dissolved.  Of course, on the same day letters were sent to each one of us as Directors.   It probably had one or two meetings...[intervenes]    Even... even Minister Dipuo Peters...[intervenes]    ...dismiss the directors in March...[intervenes]    Maybe before we deal with that, Chairperson, we should also, maybe counsel knows whether he wants to bring it, this Minister, Maswanganyi sent two business men to my house, both of whom came from his province, Limpopo…[intervenes].   No response, Chairperson. That, Chairperson, is now a deputy minister, she is now a deputy minister. 
ADV VAS SONIC SC:   You will look at the Chairperson but I want to ask you in relation to what appears to be a choreographed presentation on their side did that apply only to the ruling party or was it among the opposition parties as well?     Surely – can I ask you, because it is related to this issue; in paragraph 108 on page 27 of your affidavit if you could just read that into the record because I want to ask a couple of questions around that relating to the role of the different parties in the portfolio committee.       Now you say, and this is my point, that in your letter of the 8 t h of March 2017 you say to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee that we have investigated the following matter, the Swifambo matter, the Siyangena matter and other matters worth billions of Rands.  You say here that instead of concentrating on the wrongdoing of possible tenderers and management they were concentrating on things that they said the Board was doing, notwithstanding that the amounts you were talking about were billions of rands.     What I want to ask in that connection is but surely the opposition parties would have said no but what are you doing about Siyangena, can you give us a report, can you give us a report on Swifambo, we understand you have taken them to Court, or was there not a voice for them?     So when you say you called willing Parliamentarians are you saying Parliamentarians who were not part of the Portfolio Committee but who were interested in PRASA’s ...[intervenes]      Oh.     And were there also members of the ruling party or none of their members?     Yes, okay.  Mr Molefe when the Parliamentarians who displayed a genuine interest in fixing up PRASA’s problems, if I can put it that way, when they met with you and other members of the Board, what was their impression of the – sorry – what was their impression of what the Board was uncovering?   I mean we have heard, because we have seen the court reports like Swifambo, Siyangena, what was their reaction?     I am raising it in the context of how a democracy can better function if you have more effective public representatives, even if they belong to a minority party.  For example could a Parliamentarian not write to the Hawks and say but what’s happening to the Swifambo matter, what’s happening to the Siyangena matter?     Mr Molefe you understand the issue that’s been raised, where the invoices part of the documents that Mr Mashaba gave to Mr Mamabolo.  You see you asked him ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFI:   It reads as follows Chairperson. “I found the conduct of the members of the Portfolio Committee to be disgraceful and it appeared from their line of questioning that they appeared to have been lobbied to compel the BOC to stop the investigations.  The looting of the public purse and holding those responsible for such looting accountable appears not to be important to them at all.” Now the pattern Chairperson here is the same, I mean you go to – you look at the conduct of Minister Maswanganyi, you look at the conduct of Minister Dipuo Peters much later, now in 2017, and you look at the conduct of the President and Minister Radebe that evening in a meeting, it is all about how do we frustrate this drive to end corruption. Now I don’t know what it is that all of these people have in common, what is it that draws them so close to one another that they would not disagree on issues that are so obvious.     That is so.  That is so Chairperson.     Investigator or investigation, I don’t mind if an investigator who is investigating a government department, because government departments deal a lot with classified information, if the State Security says we have got to make sure that these people are going to have access to classified documents are vetted, are people who can be trusted, it is understandable, but you cannot go out there in the general public of South Africa and say every company must be vetted by State Security Agency, they have got far more work to do to protect the country than to worry about vetting people who are investigating corrupt individuals.      Well I think it is difficult to remember specifically now but we had ...[intervenes]      No, no it won’t.     There had been revelations that people who were in intelligence you know got involved in corrupt activities there had been report about their offices being broken into, information disappearing.  There are instances actually also of monies disappearing from those offices.   Now we are being asked, and some of them of course have been implicated in some of the contracts in these companies, including PRASA, now have been asked that they should be the ones who vet the investigators.  The investigators are going to investigate and they have to investigate their conduct as well as service providers to PRASA, so it did not make sense to me to ask for that to be done except where you are looking for an elegant way of frustrating the investigations without appearing to be doing so.     Should I read it?      “It was also strange to me that such SSA vetting was only required for Werksmans and not for any other service provider conducting investigations at PRASA.  Moreover, this requirement only emerged as more and more corruption was exposed.”
