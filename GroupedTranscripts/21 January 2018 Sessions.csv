CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning – good afternoon Mr Pretorius, good afternoon everybody.     Thank you.  Good afternoon, Mr Pretorius.    Before you proceed I just want to say I had intended to make a statement in regard to the conduct of some newspapers and journalists and editors in regard to certain articles that were published in some newspapers yesterday, but we are starting late and I will do that tomorrow morning.  As from – as of today, as for   Okay, and the legal team I also understand has no problem with that.    Yes, thank you.  Alright, so we – I do not know about breaking for lunch.  If it were – if there would be no objection from the witness and the legal team I    Mr Agrizzi, would that be in order?    Thank you very much.  So that is what we will do then.  We will take    Yes.    For some reason I seem not to have the index anymore.  It would have been on S1, is it not?    Oh, I thought it appeared before the statement.   Does it not cover the affidavit?  Mr Agrizzi′s affidavit?    Okay, well if it is at the correct places at the beginning then it should be at the beginning.  Okay, but for now…[intervenes]    Yes?    Yes?    Yes?    Yes.   Okay, alright.    Okay.    Oh, well, then should it not be mentioned when it is going to be handed up?    Oh, okay, okay, okay, alright.    You see, because we need to mark it if it is handed up already.    S8.    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    You never got an opportunity to establish whether that what you were told is true?  Because you say as far as you were told.  So, I take it that you do not have personal knowledge whether she was a Shareholder and whether she was also a Director, it is just what you were told?    Yes?   Yes.    Yes, yes, and the document that you are talking about that you have handed into – either the legal team or the investigation team, as far as you understand it, does it reflect that at a certain stage she was a Shareholder and Director?  Or only one of those as you understand the document?    Thank you very much.    Okay.    Yes.    No, that is fine, that is fine.    Or before you deal with that.  Would the rallies be at stadia or would they be in halls, more or less most of the time?    Oh, Siaxhoba rallies?    Which would normally be at stadia?    Okay.    Yes, and what year was this one if you are able to tell us?    Well, I do not see people holding hands, but I see some orange.    That is part of the…[intervenes]    Bosasa logo?    Yes, well I see something that looks like a wheel close to the orange part, is that also part of the Bosasa logo?    Oh, and then there is a picture of somebody, whose face is not shown in full.  So is the wheel at the orange part that would be part of the logo?    Okay, alright.    Thank you.    Yes, I am thinking of that, but I wanted to allow him to give his answer to your question in full first before I go back.  Because, ja.    Okay, so you may continue and then…[intervenes]    Oh, okay.  Let us go back to page 37, Mr Agrizzi?   And I am just going to say something in general and then ask you a specific question.  It is going to be important as you give your evidence to tell me which of the activities you were personally involve in, particularly with regard to delivering some things to certain people.    Or preparing them and handing them over to somebody to deliver and getting a report that it was delivered and when for example you talk about providing catering for supports at President Zuma′s birthday parties to say as much as you personally know about that.  When you talk about the maintenance at Ms Nomvula Mokonyane′s house in Roodepoort to indicate what you personally know about, that as oppose to what you may have told was done.So I just want to ask you about paying and organising funerals in respect of diseased family members, did you ever get to be personally involved in regard to that, other than maybe preparing money and maybe giving to somebody to go and makesure that it is delivered?    So in regard to that for example therefore you are telling me something that you personally know happened?    Yes, okay.  And the arrangements about the rental of a vehicle forperiods of three months and so on, that also you have personal knowledge of, or how far does your knowledge go in regard to that?    Yes?    Yes?    Yes.    Yes?    Yes, and the catering for ANC rallies, you have just indicated you have told us about that.  Have you got – are you able to give me an idea about, if you are able to, how many rallies you can think of where you actually made arrangements?  It may be – maybe there are too many, in which case you cannot say.  Maybe there are more or less a number that you can tell a reasonable estimate, but if you are not able to I will understand?    Yes, and would they have been, in terms of the rallies, you said theywere Siyanqoba rallies.  Was it only Siyanqoba rallies or also other rallies?    Different rallies?    Yes, all within Gauteng I assume?    Yes, excuse me.  And the maintenance at her house at Roodepoort, how much personal involvement did you have in regard to that and did you ever go to her house and see maintenance that had been effected there?    No, thank you very much, Mr Agrizzi.  Mr Pretorius you may proceed.   I am sorry, in 2014, I am sorry this was in 2008/2009, was she still MEC for Security at that stage, as far as you remember?    I am just wondering what she had to do with hospitals, if she was MEC for Security.    Okay, so that maybe have been the angle from which she came in for MEC for Security?    This analysis that you did as Bosasa, did you do it, because youwere going to be paid for doing it, irrespective of who may ultimately have got the tender?  Or did you do it on the understanding that you would get the tender in the end?  Because I see here you say you spent about R2-million I think in regard to that analysis so what was the basis for your doing that analysis?    So the understanding was that you would not be charging for thatanalysis, because there would be a tender and maybe you would get the tender?    Yes?    Okay.    Okay, thank you.    How did you, that is Bosasa, come to be the ones talking about who should be appointed to the department to Ms Nomvula Mokonyane as department as consultants?  How did that come about?    Was it Bosasa′s own decision that consultants be found who would assist the department or did somebody in the department ask Bosasa to please find consultants for them?    So your interactions with these consultants, these specific consultants at that stage had nothing to do with anything that came from thedepartment?  In other words, you knew that there was a tender that would soon be going out?    And you decided that you needed to get consultants whom you would recommend, I guess, to the department, is that right?    And you just made sure that it would be consultants who – so you would make sure that they get the job of overseeing the bid and they would in return have to make sure that you got the tender?    Okay, thank you.    At whose house?    Okay, alright, thank you.    And seeing to in the affidavit is in quotes.    Okay.    Well, you can tell us the amount as well.    And he would deliver it himself personally or sometimes he would send you or somebody else?    Oh, so sometimes you went to Ms Nomvula Mokonyane′s house with him?   Okay, maybe it might not be a good idea to mention the address.    From security point of view.    But I do not know Mr Pretorius, I think the witness wants to demonstrate that he knows where the house is.    But I do not know from a security point of view, well, or maybe it isenough if it is just the street and not the number.    Yes?    Well that ties in with a question that I had intended to ask earlier in relation to Christmas groceries, if I can call it that, that you said from after – from 02/2003 every end of the year these were provided to her, is that right?    Yes.  Now I wanted to find out, you said this started as far as you know around 2002/2003.  Are you able to tell me whether by the time you left Bosasa whenever it was end of the year this was still continuing, or did it stop at some stage while you were at Bosasa?    Would that have been 2015 or 2016?    Yes, okay, alright.  Now you have mentioned her two houses.    Yes, are there any special features that you might mention that show that you have been there, in case somebody were to deny that you have been there?    And you say you went to that house numerous times?    Frequently, over a number of years?    Thank you.    Thank you.    Are you able to recall around when, which year, when did this happen where you were outside of Minister Mokonyane′s house and you were talking, you and Mr Gavin wants to know where – talking about this?  If you are not able to tell it is fine, but if you are able to, it would help, which year?    Okay, that is fine.    No, that is fine.  And before Mr Pretorius ask another question, let me ask this.  The monthly payments to Ms Mokonyane that you have talked about, didthey happen – were they still happening when you left Bosasa?    And they had started round about what?  2002/2003?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    You began to know about them when you started packing?    Whether or not they had happened before that, you do not know?    Okay.    I am trying to remember from your affidavit, maybe you might be able to tell in terms of when you started packing, would that have been about four/five years before you left?    Oh, okay.    Yes, okay, but quite some time?   A number of years before you left?    Yes, so and you say throughout the time when, from when you started packing the money to the time you left, Ms Mokonyane was receiving monthly payments?    Yes.    Yes.   Yes, but did you also say sometimes he would deliver it when you were with him, or not?    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Now was the money that was given to her packed in what you have told us last week grey security bags like the other amounts?    Okay, thank you.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay.    I am not sure that I understand that.   You say the more you pay somebody that you want to bribe?    The more likely they will not help you, is that what you are saying?    Oh, what are you talking about?    So your concern arose out of the fact that some of these favours were done publicly?    Yes, okay, no that I understand.    Yes.    Now let me put it this way.  Am I to understand your evidence to be to the effect that you complained to Mr Watson on that occasion that you have talked about that Bosasa has paid a lot of money to Ms Mokonyane, but Bosasa was – Ms Mokonyane was not giving Bosasa anything?    And this had happened over a long period of time?    Yes, okay, and what did Mr Watson say when you said we are wasting money, we are paying her a lot of money, but we are not getting anything, sheis not passing contracts to our side, or you know making sure that we get some business from her department, what did Mr Watson say in relation to this?  His response?    Okay, thank you.    Yes, no, at least I understand, ja.    Yes.    Okay.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius, do you know whether prior to this discussion that you were having with Mr Watson where you were expressing your frustration that Ms Mokonyane was being paid a lot of money over a long period, but she was not giving Bosasa anything.  Do you know whether Mr Watson had at any stage got her to agree that she would do something for Bosasa or not really?   What exactly, what exactly was she supposed to do about Mr Jacob Zuma and about the prosecution?    That is charges against Bosasa?    And where was Mr Jacob Zuma going to feature in regard to whatshe was going to do?    So are you saying that she was going to speak to Mr Jacob Zuma at the time with a view to achieving the dropping of charges against Bosasa?    At that stage you did not know whether – you had not been told there were charges?    There were no charges.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    So your complaint against Ms Nomvula Mokonyane was that she was just taking the money and not delivering?    I am also trying to understand.    You are saying not for herself only but for other people as well?    So there would be, there would have been other people who were like her in the sense that they were being paid a lot of money, but they were also not giving Bosasa any benefit?    Okay.  Thank you.    You said a minute ago that your point in relation to your discussion with Mr Watson outside Ms Mokonyane′s house was why do we need to pay bribes?  Did I understand you correctly?    Yes, but the impression that I had got earlier on when you were relating to relating your discussion with Mr Watson was not – I did not get the impression that, that was the point.  I got the impression that you were frustrated that you were paying and not getting anything in return.  I am mentioning that, because that was the impression I got and I just want you to reflect and indicate which one of the two impressions are correct.  I thought your frustration was out of the fact that you werepaying as Bosasa Ms Mokonyane a lot of money, but were getting nothing in return and that your point was, what is the point of keeping on paying if we are not getting anything back?    But you see, it is two different points.  If your point is we should not do bribes it is one thing.   If your point is, we should not do bribes if we are not going to get anything in return that is another thing.  So what I was saying to you a minute ago was that when you earlier on gave evidence about your discussion with Mr Watson outside Ms Mokonyane′s house the impression that I got was that your point was, why should we pay bribes if we are not going to get anything back?  But later on you said your point was we should not be doing bribes.  So I just want to see whether you want to clarity that for me?  So it is two different impression I am getting.    I am not sure, but Mr Pretorius may proceed.    I must just say before you answer, satisfy yourself, if you say yes, satisfy yourself, that, that is what you believe, that is your answer.  If you say no, satisfy yourself that, that is the answer that you are giving.    Is it possible that in that discussion you did not have one point to make, namely we – why must we continue paying bribes to continue business, but that you had more than one point to make, one being why should we make – continue to pay bribes to do business, but if we continue to pay them, why should we pay them when we get nothing in return.  Were you making both points, were you making only the one point namely why should we continue paying bribes, or were you making both points?    Of course from Bosasa′s point of view based on evidence that you have given last week, paying bribes served a good purpose for them when they got a lot of contracts and a lot of contracts were extended without tender and without competition.  That part has to be true that it served a good purpose for them.  It was anillegal purpose, but it was a good purpose for them, is it not?    Yes, okay, thank you.    So Mr Watson did not go along with the idea of stopping doing business in this way, namely through bribes?    Yes, thank you.   Well let me ask this Mr Agrizzi, when one reads your affidavit one gets the impression that you have a very good memory and I see that you have just told us that you can even remember on what day of the week it was when you were introduced to Mr Seopela.  Have you got a very good memory?    Okay, alright, thank you.    Maybe before you proceed, you said he was, Mr Seopela a consultant to Bosasa or to Mr Gavin Watson.  He was a consultant, is that right?    And in terms of the work that he was doing was that liaising with potential clients for Bosasa and being a link with clients or what was the content of his duties as a consultant?    Okay.   Yes, thank you.    Okay.    No, what Mr Pretorius is asking at this stage…[intervenes]    Is this, you have just told me that Mr Seopela told you that he had interactions with certain people in enforcement at the NPA?    And Mr Pretorius is asking whether you ever had occasion to receive information from Mr Seopela which corroborated what he had told you, namely that he had connections and he was interacting with people in the NPA?    No at this stage…[intervenes]    No, at this stage he has not asked for the names, he just wants you to be able to say, yes I did if that is the case.    Get information through him that there was such a stage that he did have interaction with people in the NPA, then he can ask further questions.    Yes?   Thank you.    Yes, okay.    I confirm the same thing.    Okay.    So whereas, as you told me last week, in regard to requests for payments you would confirm with Mr Gavin Watson in regard to money requested by Mr Seopela the word from Mr Watson was, in effect, if Mr Seopela ask for money, justgive him the money.  So you did not have to after some time you did not have to basically check with Mr Watson?  As long as Mr Seopela wanted the money you were supposed to give him, is that correct?    Yes.    Yes, but the point I was making was, that I was wanting you toconfirm is that you after – whether after Mr Watson had told you if Mr Seopela is asking you for money, just give him.  I was asking whether that meant that you did not have to confirm with Mr Watson each time Mr Seopela asked money, whether you should give him.  You just gave him, because that was an instruction?    Yes, but with Seopela not with Mr Watson?    Ja?    Okay, alright, thank you.    Okay, alright, thank you.   Okay.    Okay, thank you.  Now, just something arising from last week′s evidence.  When you were told by a Director or somebody was requesting money, when you were told by such a person who the money would be used to pay, would you always record that in the black book or not always, only sometimes?    Okay, okay, so…[intervenes]    Yes, so if – I know that we did look at some pages of the black book last week, and I cannot remember whether – I think you might have said that some black books got lost or whatever, but if we were to get any of the black books it would have names of people who you were told were going to be paid by different people, who took money from you?    Okay, thank you.    How long would one black book last before it was filled up, more or less on average?    Oh.   Okay, alright, thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius, I guess for onward payment to the Department means for onward payment to certain officials in the Department as opposed to, to the Department.    Ja.    Maybe you need to clarify that Mr Pretorius, because you are asking him in the context of Section 23.7.1, which relates to 2008/2016, are you asking about the whole of that period?    Mr Pretorius will follow up if he is not happy with that answer.    So the R500 000 to which you refer in paragraph 23.7.1 per month?    Was being given to Mr Seopela and according to him he was paying it over to some or other official or officials in the Department of Correctional Services before Mr Moyane′s time?    That is right, and you are saying that after Mr Moyane′s appointment as Commissioner of Correctional Services that monthly payment that you were giving to Mr Seopela increased to R750 000?    Yes, and Mr Seopela is the one that would pay it to whoever it wassupposed to be paid?    Thank you.  Do you know whether it was paid to one official or whether to a number of – it was shared among a number of officials or divided among a number of officials?  In other words do you know whether Mr Seopela while it was R500 000 a month would divide it among a number of officials at Correctional Services or whether it was going to one person only?    Yes.   Yes, okay.    And in grey security bags?    Okay.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  So in other words what you are saying is Mr Seopela as far as you know was the type of person who would have – if he was required to take this money and go and pay certain officials, he would go and do that and he was receiving his own salary as a consultant in relation to his work for Bosasa?   Thank you.    And was that a contract which originated in 2013 as you said?    And you say that the contract related to the provision of systems of security control in the various courts?    Yes, that is what you are being asked.    I am sorry Mrs or?    Ms Masha?    I am sorry do you remember what her position in the Department of Justice was?    Sorry?    In security, okay.    Yes, as you mention them if you are able to say what, whether they were in security or what?    I am sorry, Mamsie?   Okay.    Okay.    Where they were given cash?    And each one of the ones that you have mentioned?    Thank you.    I am sorry, before you get there, let me ask about these three in respect of whom you have personal knowledge of them receiving money, according to your evidence.    You said Mr Joe Gumede and yourself?    The two of you were present?   Now, let us talk about Ms Masha?    Was it more than one occasion where you observed…[intervenes]    One occasion?    And can you remember how much the amount was on that occasion or not really?    Yes?    Yes.    Yes.    In regard to her, where was the place where cash was handed over to her?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay, and are you able to recall more or less when that mayhave been in terms of just a year?    You cannot remember?    Okay, alright.  Mr Norman Thubane, what was, was he also within the security section of the Department of Justice or what was his position as you understood it?    Yes.    Yes, I am sorry, did you say in regard to Ms Masha you cannot remember how much cash was – you cannot remember?    Alright.  Mr Norman Thubane, can you remember the amount?    Yes, it may be in the affidavit as well.    About how many occasions were you present when he was given cash, if you are able to recall?    About five or six occasions?   And in terms of years or year would that also have been around 13/14 or other years?    Yes, and the place where…[intervenes]    Various places?    Ja.    So you at that time got to know where he stayed?    Yes, yes, and did you only go to his house when you gave him a lift only once, or did it happen more than once?    Only once?    But would your recollection of his house be as good as your recollection was of Ms Mokonyane?    Not as good, yes?    If it was disputed that you have been there you would, you think you would be able to find your way there?    Okay, alright, and then Ms, you say Mamsie?    Mamsie, yes, with regard to her you cannot remember the amount as well with her?    Somewhere?    Okay, no that is fine.    Well, I think in regard to Mr Thubane you may have it in the affidavit, I am not sure about the others.    And also where this lady was given cash…[intervenes]    As well?    Yes?    About how many times did you observe?    About four/five times?    Yes, and when you met her on the road can you recall what road it was?    Yes.    Okay.   Okay.    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    Yes, it is.  We are going to take the lunch adjournment now and we    Yes Mr Pretorius.    Or make a request, ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes, no that is fine.    Let us do that, ja.    Yes.    Maybe before you proceed let us go back a little bit.  You say whenever you needed protection, as I understand it.  Me putting it in my own words she would make sure you get it.   What exactly are you talking about in regard to protection?    What form of protection did you ask her for and she gave – she made sure you got?    President Zuma?    Yes.   Now as I understood you, you were saying at the beginning that is how it was like.  Is that right or did I misunderstood you?    Oh, right through?    Okay, alright.  Let us continue.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Well to be fair to you I think somewhere in your affidavit you do say – maybe towards the end – you do say that within the time available you could not put in everything and that there is more that can be given and you are prepared to do that.  I have no doubt that the investigators and the legal team still have lots of work to do with you.  You have already mentioned some pieces of evidence that you have given them which they are looking at or which is supposed to help them do further investigations, but let me say that it is very important that you be satisfied that what is in the affidavit is correct.  It is very important that you be satisfied that what you havetold me is what you intended to say.  So – and, and indeed if there are things that have not been said that you have not had a chance to say the legal team will make sure that you talk to them and if need be supplementary affidavits can be made, because it is very important that this Commission gets given as much information as possible from people who have got personal knowledge of what was happening in regard to activities that fall under its terms of reference.  So, so if you feel that you, there is something that is important feel free to make sure that you are able to say it.    Yes.   Yes.    No, no, that that is fine.  I have no doubt that they are working towards making sure that everything else that might not have been covered here which is relevant to our terms of reference you are able to later on bring, bring in, bring to this Commission and give evidence about.  So, so they will look at that.  The legal team will look at that and certainly there is room for you to come back and give more evidence.  As long as what you have is relevant to our terms of reference and is seen as quite material.    Thank you, but what you – the details you wanted to give you have given now in regard to this?    Okay, alright.  Thank you, thank you.    Maybe, maybe I could then say - put this question to you Mr Agrizzi.     They relate to earlier?    Yes.    Okay, alright. 2. The details you have, is it correct that the details you have given now actually mean that to the extent that you may have said earlier on that in your discussion with Mr Watson you said you were – Bosasa was paying Ms Mokonyane, but not getting anything in return.  That might not be completely accurate, because there were somethings that you got even thought it might not have contracts.  Is that right?    You got what you term protection?    Right.  Okay, thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius, around what year would that have been when this report - verbal report - was made to you?    Oh, okay.  Thank you.    I am sorry again Mr Pretorius.  I am sorry.  You mentioned a figure of two million in relation to when you were given this – either when you were given this verbal report or when you were told that Dr de Wee was upset with you.  Is part of what you were told or what you understood that he was to be paid R2 million or, or that was R2 million that was going to be distributed among a number of officials?    Thank you.  I interrupted you Mr Pretorius.  I am sorry.  You can proceed.   I understood you to say in relation to the R300 00 monthly payment that after packing the cash you would give it to Mr Leshabane.    I am, I am wondering because I understood in the affidavit that what you were doing here under 23.7 and this item of R300 00 per month falls under 23.7.3 that you were listing monies that you used to hand over to Mr Seopela on a monthly basis from 2008 to 2016.  That is what the last sentence of paragraph 23.7 appears tosay.  Is there something I am misunderstanding?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh.    For both Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and Transport.    Okay, alright.  Thank you.  I guess that then, because the affidavit just refers if I understand correctly only to Mr Seopela, Mr Pretorius or am I wrong?   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh, okay.  No, thank you, thank you.   Do you know whether there were, there was a specific reason why it was almost always different places?  You might or might not know, but I am just curious whether there is a particular reason to make sure it was not in one and the same placeall the time.    Yes.  Okay, thank you.    In terms of the frequency with which you were the one who would give him the money what kind of percentage would you put that at?  Would you saymaybe 80 percent of the time more or less you would give him the money or 50 percent of the time or less than that?  I just want to have some idea of the frequency of occasions where you gave it to him yourself.    Okay, thank you.    What was he being difficult about?    And why …[intervenes]?    And why was Bosasa wanting to meet with him?    For what purpose, why did he, why did you want to explain to him what Bosasa was about?    You wanted to, you wanted him to cooperate with Bosasa.  Is that right?    You wanted him to work with you?    For purposes of making sure or for what purposes?    Obviously there must have been things that had happened before which made you conclude which made you conclude that he was being difficult or maybe negative towards, towards Bosasa.  I guess you are going to tell us about those.    Okay, alright and, and this would have been around what time whenyou met him for the first time or you might not recall?    Okay.  Mr Pretorius.    I am not sure, I am not sure you can clarify that.    What was being discussed, you are saying what was being discussed was in part the negative coverage by the media of Bosasa?    Okay and a decision was taken.    At that meeting.  Just say again what that decision was or what wasto be done or not done in terms of that decision.    You said that the other persons who were at that meeting other than yourself and Mr Gavin Watson it became apparent to you during the meeting that they were members of Parliament.  Did you get to know whether the other persons other than Mister – in addition to Mr Vincent Smith were also members of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services?  Did you know whether that was the case or not?    You say Magagula, there is Magagula …[intervenes].    [Indistinct].    Okay, thank you.  You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    All monthly?    Where the payments to them or where were the payments to them made?  Was it each one – normally each one at the place convenient to him or her or were they always or were they – did they normally come together for purposes ofreceiving payment at a particular place?    Close by the Bosasa office?    Yes and – but you did not know where her house was?  You just knew she lived there?    She lived close by that is all that is what you.    So she would come in and collect her payment?    Okay.   But they took place in Gauteng and not in Cape Town where the Portfolio Committee Assets?    Yes okay.  Over weekends maybe or not really it could be any time during the week?    Ja okay thank you.   You did mention maybe one or two places at which you delivered cash to Mr Vincent Smith at some stage, is that correct?    Do you want to just repeat one of two of those places in regard to him?    And in regard Maga – oh Magagula you said you do not rememberthat you ever delivered any cash to him?    You were present?    Oh okay yes but do you remember the place where that delivery took place even though you did not hand over the cash yourself?    You cannot remember.  And Ms Winnie Ngwenya can you remember any one or two occasions where you can say this is the place or these are the places where cash was delivered either by yourself of by somebody else in your presence?    Oh okay, okay.  Oh she is the one that you understood ..    Lived not far from the Bosasa offices?    Yes okay thank you.  Mr Pretorius.    Actually I thought that you say – you were saying that he would put the money in his leather jacket or sometimes he would have a newspaper but actually you are saying you would bring a newspaper, bring the money in a newspaper?    Okay thank you.    No that is fine.  Okay you can answer that – answer that question.    So Mr Seopela after you had said that to him that Mr Vincent Smith did not want to see you anymore would have been under the impression after that that there were no further dealings with Mr Vincent Smith?    Okay thank you.    How did the increase come about?  Did he request it or was it just decided by Mr Gavin Watson?    So the jump was from R45 000,00 a month to R100 000,00?    Okay.    About how many occasions if you are able to remember were you present when amounts were paid to him?   Sorry?    Okay thank you.  But those times some of them would have been when he was paid R45 000,00 a month and others would have been when he was paid R100 000,00 a month?  In other words some of the times fell under the previous amount, R45 000,00 and others fell under the increased amount, is that right?    Okay, alright.    Now a Portfolio Committee and a Chairperson of a Portfolio Committee does not give tenders and does not give contracts so precisely what is it that Bosasa wanted Mr Smith and the other individual members to do for them because they could not give them contracts, they could not give them tenders?  Can you just articulate that quite clearly?    So – sorry continue.    So in effect what Bosasa wanted was that in – if there was anything concerning Bosasa that came before their committee they should act and decide favourably in regard to Bosasa that is what it wanted?   Ja, thank you.   Yes Mr Pretorius.   He asked who installed the electric equipment.   Ja    I actually – the document starts at 271 ne?    You may have said 270    Yes okay.    Tell us the date of the email as well?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Is that amount of R267 667,90 which was deposited was that the equivalent of the amount – was that the rand equivalent of the amount in pounds that was mentioned in the email that precedes this one?    Okay.    So the year on that stamp on the right hand corner of page 271 you say is 2016 and not 2015?    No because to me it was appearing like 2015.    Ja okay.    Then …[intervenes].    Would it not be unlikely – would it not be likely that your answer then to my question when I asked whether the amount deposited as per the slip on the page 272 represented the amount asked for at 271?  Then it should be likely that your answer was not correct then because the document – the slip at 272 could not havebeen in response to the request at 271, is that right?    Yes the two might not be related.    Yes okay.    I cannot – oh, okay I have seen Smith, Vincent George, yes.    But, but what may, what you may have to consider and I am sure thelegal team will also consider is whether paragraph 24.9 accurately reflects what you intended to say and whether to the extent that it might not whether what you have said clarifies it or whether it is necessary to make a correction …[intervenes].    Of some kind.    Yes.    Oh, which could have caused …[intervenes].    Yes, okay.    I just want to make sure that we do not have a situation where thereis some unnecessary issue that arises from this confusion.  Maybe under cross-examination if cross-examination is granted so that there is just the clarity but as, as long you satisfy yourself that one way or another there is clarity whether there is a need for an amendment or a supplementary affidavit or there is not.  As long as the situation is clearly clarified.    Yes, …[intervenes], ja.    Ja, it may be, it may be.   Of course you know him now.  You know – you just said you do not know him.   You did know him before.    Yes, but was the request for a loan was it not made after you had got to know him after that meeting that you are talking about?    Oh that is …[intervenes].    Yes.    Yes.    Oh, okay.    This was when?  Was it 2017?    Okay, alright.    I am sorry.  What paragraph are we …[intervenes].    25.6.    Invited …[intervenes].    Yes.    Oh.    Yes.     Yes.    The Correctional Services Act.    Hm, okay.    So had the training already been done or was it done the same day?    It was done on the same day and the awards were…    Yes, but it was the awards, yes.   Yes, okay, okay.    [Intervenes].    But the training had been done by Bosasa?    Okay.    Yes.     Okay no that is fine.  As and when you pick up errors you must just make sure corrections can be made.    Other than normal annual increases?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.  And are you able to say how much the increase was in terms of percentage?   Oh it was doubled – more than doubled or about doubled.    Okay thank you.    The specifications.  The specifications, you compiled the specifications?    Oh okay.    You told us what the increase was that you were given after you had made the contribution that you made to ensure Bosasa got that contract and you said that they painted your house as well, is that right?    What is the monetary value that you could put on the – on them painting your house?    Okay, alright, thank you.    Just before you proceed Mr Pretorius.  Now drafting it in such a way that the award of the tender or contract to Bosasa would be guaranteed.  How would this be achieved in terms of drafting?  Would it be that you would put in fissures that only Bosasa is likely to have in terms of what it can do with the tender?    That it is unlikely that other companies would have, is that right?    Ja give examples one or two?    They have – they had to have what?    Ja in other words?    Oh.    Oh.    Okay thank you.    Please remind me maybe I have forgotten now who was Danny?  You said he asked you to send to Danny and to Mr Gillingham?    Okay thank you.    Ja thank you.   No I think what created the problem for me is that to the – all along in respect of Mr Mansell you said – you used the surname.    But then now you said Danny and I did not know who is Danny.    Ja.    Ja, okay, alright. Well we have five minutes to go and then it will be fine for the day.   Thank you.    This amount is quite a big amount but maybe not by Bosasa standards.  Was it as far as you are concerned the true value of the contract or was there any act of inflation?  Now I am talking about this one but maybe you can enlighten me on others as well because some of these contracts that Bosasa seems to have been awarded at Correctional Services and the one in the Department of Justice in 13 the amounts seemed quite large but it maybe that they were – they reflected the true value but I just want to find out from you?    But – but does that talk to the question of whether there was inflation?    At the beginning?    Okay, okay.    That is in regard to this one.  Now in regard to the others that were –other contracts that you awarded to Bosasa by Correctional Services.    And the one by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development in 2013 are you able to say that in regard to those two there was inflation of prices or not really?    There was?    Thank you.    This might not – or let me ask.  Are you sure that with regard to Mncwaba the last letter is a and not e?    You would have to check, okay.   Okay.    It might be a but I know – I know Mncwabe with an e so.    Okay no that is fine I just wanted to make sure that we get that right if it is e.    Yes.  We will take – we will adjourn for today.  Mr Pretorius and Mr Agrizzi.    Ja we have an hour to make up but I think I had indicated that we would start early tomorrow – earlier than normal tomorrow maybe at nine in order to do that but I would like to change that and suggest that we add the hour from four to five ifpossible tomorrow.  Would that be okay with you Mr Agrizzi?    Thank you.  And Mr Pretorius would that be alright?    Okay so tomorrow morning we start at ten.  I just need to attend to something relating to the commission.  So if we start at nine I will not have that time.    Ja but I have got something else also that will need my attention.  Okay thank you we adjourn now and we will resume tomorrow at ten o’clock.  Weadjourn. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Good afternoon sir.    Most definitely, Chair.    I am at your full disposal.    Briefly, Chair, what happened was, my family was coming down, I was working at the time, and they had a bad car accident and they were all in ICU for about six weeks, and basically Gavin would take charge and he would try and assist where he could with the family.  I still had to continue work, so he would pop in and see them in PE when he was there.    At that stage, Chair, he was very caring about it, he was very concerned about it.  It was still in the early stages.    That is correct, Chair.    Previously, Chair, she was one of the Directors of Dyambu Holdings, who in turn owned shareholding in Dyambu Operations Pty Ltd.    As far as I am aware and as I have been told she was aShareholder and a Director of Dyambu Holdings.    Chair, I remember seeing a document many years ago where she was registered on a letterhead of Dyambu Holdings.  I have just handed to the team a document that I managed to find that might also add some light to the matter as well, but if I could add, Chair…[intervenes]    That we were always told that she was a Shareholder and a Director.    Of Dyambu Holdings and of Dyambu.    Chair, the document that I gave them was a sale of shares agreement, and I wanted them to just do an investigation on that, so that they can establish for themselves.    If I recall correctly, Chair, it was the MEC for Safety and Security in Gauteng.  As far as I can remember I met her at the Bosasa offices a fewtimes.    Chair, if I can refer to my affidavit, on 20.3, there were numerous occasions…[intervenes]    Sorry, 22.3.    There were numerous occasions and it was an annual effect that had to be sorted out annually, as well as various other benefits that were given.    The list of items which were the same more or less every year, it might have changed a little bit here and there, but it was 120 cases of cold drinks,four cases of high quality Whiskey, 40 cases of beer, eight lambs, cut up obviously, 12 cases of frozen chicken, 200kg of beef in various braai packs and then numerous cases of Premium Brandy and some speciality alcohol.  I would get a list as a matter of fact.  Her PA would phone me with that.    Well, because at that stage I did not think anything was wrong, everything went through the books as normal, as if we were using it for something else.    I would arrange initially for the delivery check.    After the period I would, there was a lady by the name of Catherine that would do it and at that stage we had an Executive Chef and he would also oversee it for me as well.    Chair, there were numerous requests.  They were given through the year.  These I would have to contact a Personal Assistant and these included organising and paying for funerals in respect of diseased family members.  I would have to arrange for a rental vehicle for up to three months at a time for her daughter, when her daughter was coming back from China, where she was studying, and…[intervenes]    Normally the rentals would be arranged through Blake′s Travel.    There were numerous catering for rallies on her instruction, for instance the election campaign was run from the offices we had to arrange for all of that.  We had to arrange the parties and the conferences at our offices.    There were numerous rallies.  There were rallies that we would have to cater up to 40/50 000 people.   For the ruling party, Chair.    These were the Siaxhoba rallies.    Correct.    Normally.    Chair, we would get ridiculous requests in the middle of the night saying that we needed to sort out birthday party cakes, cater for supporters000 at a time, so we would have to just do it.    Correct.    That is correct.    Chair, I recall one Sunday evening Gavin Watson phoned me – sorry, it was the afternoon.  I had to drive through to Café Mozart and then deal with agentleman Fritz with Mr Watson and actually design this cake there.  It had to be ready the next morning.    When I was 14 years old working in a bakery.    Yes, Chair.    I cannot remember when it was, Chair.  It was about – it was on Zuma′s 72nd birthday.    I do.    The photograph is very bad, it does appear, because I know, I designed it, in between if you look there, there is a shadow silhouette of people holding hands.  In between the people holding hands you will notice on the top tier there is what seems dark blue writing and a crescent over it in orange.  That there is actually the Bosasa group logo.    That is right.  That was the…[intervenes]    The Bosasa logo.   Yes, it looks like a bit of a tombstone upside down.    That is right.    That is right.    Thank you, Chair.    This was the maintenance at the house which she owned in Silverfields, Roodepoort, which included all the electric fencing, generators, CCTV,gardening, ponds, lights, gates, absolutely everything really.    Chair, I would be given an instruction to do it by Gavin Watson the CEO and I would make sure that the job got done.    That is correct.    Chair, in 2008/2009 Mokonyane would visit quite often and atone specific stage Bosasa was approached to do a full analysis on the security of the hospitals in Gauteng specifically.    Sorry, Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    The report was given to Gavin Watson.    It was submitted to Nomvula Mokonyane.    Yes, Chair.    Yes, Chair.    Chair, when a request like that was made I was told to leave everything and personally go and see to it.  So I was personally involved.  Although I might not have made the food or put up the tent I would have had to authorise it, sign it and hand it over, and I would be responsible ultimately, and accountable for ensuring that everything went successfully.    I can even recall where we had to put up tents and that, Chair.    Chair, the daughter would phone me up and request, I remember it vividly, an Audi A3 Cabriolet.  I at one stage even called the daughter in, because there had been numerous accidents.    And problems with the vehicles.    And it started getting concerning.    So I actually called her in one day and sat her down and said ″can I arrange for driver training, special driver training for you″, because it was getting embarrassing.    So I was personally involved.   Sorry, Chair, it is too many to remember.  I will have to consult with the ex-Chef that was there who would know exactly, and I would have to speak to some people, but I cannot remember how many.  It was well over 10 or 12 rallies.    No, Chair, there were various issues.    They were totally different ones, correct.    Yes, mostly in Gauteng.    On numerous occasions I attended at the house with Mr Watson and I would at the house with Mr Watson walk the site with one of the technical teams and explain to them how I wanted it done.  I would then go back afterwards and check that they had done the work properly.  I did not wanted to get lambasted.    The information that I was given was basically that the report was to be given to someone else and that person would submit it as a tender when response to a tender and we would just be doing all the hard work for everybody else and everybody else would benefit.  He actually mentioned at that stage was a gentleman by the name of Reggie Nkabinde that Papa Leshabane mentioned wouldprobably be given the tender.    As far as I can recall it was in the ANC Youth League.  I cannot recall exactly what post it was.  I know that he is now the Treasury General I believe of the ANC Youth League.    Unfortunately not, I do not have any information, because I did not keep any on it, sorry.    I am sure if – that is correct, but I am sure if the investigating team goes into the records of the tenders they will come across the tender.    Most definitely.    As far as I recall she was.    Chair, at that stage there was a major issue with the Gauteng hospitals in terms of security.  I mean numerous tenders that were out at that stage and if I recall correctly they had problems with doctors being stabbed, especially at Leratongand at Baragwanath.    That is correct.    It was an analysis of the current and existing security infrastructure.  They had a major problem with regards to infrastructural access control, ingress control and there was a major problem with the amount of guards that were being utilised in the wrong places and not in the right places.  So the whole blueprint that we put together was a holistic view on taking Gauteng′s security of the hospitals and coordinating them with centralised control platforms, centralised control rooms and being able to minimise on guarding and utilise that funds to be able to pay for additional technology requirements.    The initial cost was approximately 2-million, I do not remember the exact cost on it, it is on my laptop, which I do not have anymore, however, the idea was that if we do the analysis and we provide a good report on how we could assist and improve things that there would be a tender promulgated that we could be involved with.    Chair, there was no official agreement or discussion regarding that, between…[intervenes]    Myself and the MEC and at that stage I cannot say that would have been discussed with Mr Watson as he would handle high level issues.    As far as I know there was no charge.    No payment was received.    I recall there was a tender that was promulgated for hospitals, not in the same light as this one, it was for a guarding tender and I do recall submitting a tender, if I remember it was cancelled.  Nothing ever happened.    Once more, Chair, we were asked to do an analysis and a report on the securing of the dams in South Africa for the Department of Water Affairs.  At the time Minister Nomvula Mokonyane was the Minister of Water and Sanitation.  The same procedure was followed.  We were asked to do an analysis, come up with asolution, so what I did was, because time was short, they wanted a very fast generic overview, which I provided them with.  I gave the report to Gavin Watson.    I know that the company never got paid for it.    For the report.    Chair, the approximate cost was about R1.3-million, because we would have to spend intensive time, I had to get the assistance of official security people that understood dams and that type of thing to assist us.    Well the report included the protection of the dams with high security fencing, to prevent any ingress or any contamination of the dams.  It includedsensors to measure levels of dams, potential leaks, breakages in dam walls.  It also included, if I recall correctly, camera systems that were integrated onto a singular platform, which to be viewed by the Minister at any one time.  So it was a comprehensive security and a holistic plan to look at the dams in South Africa.    My understanding was that this was being done in order for a tender that was coming out that we could perhaps get to work on.  So I was instructed as well by Gavin Watson to recommend a consultant group.  So normally this would be put out to a consultant, who would consult to the Department of Water Affairs and thatis basically what happened.I approached somebody, I introduced them to them and they continued.    Correct.    That is correct.    Chair, that is correct.    That is correct, Chair, a meeting was held.    At that meeting we explained that they needed to register interms of the Department of Water Affairs and Sanitation.  At the meeting I was present, Gavin Watson was present, an elderly gentleman called Paul Silvo, who has been busy with government for many years on these types of projects was present, and a gentleman by the name of Raymond Moodley was present as well.So we had the Chiefton team there and ourselves.    Correct, we did discuss the contemplated specifications.    At that stage no tenders had come out as yet.   It was still in the process of being promulgated and that would have been Chiefton′s responsibility.    Chair, that is correct.    Most definitely.    That is correct.    They would be awarded the tender and they had to ensure that they would be pro the group going forward.    That is correct, Chair.    It would mean that they would manipulate the tender in such a way that it would benefit Bosasa and Bosasa would get the business.   Chair, we had previously worked with them on something else and it did not work out at that stage, but that is why we kept in contact with everybody.    Strangely neither, Chair, if I may respond?  What happened was, there was a third party, whom I did not know at that stage, who was orchestrating behind the scenes that there would be a company that would be employed as the consultants and that company would choose the consultant.  I actually never met the person from that company.  I was just told about it.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.   I needed to find and recommend a consultant to the Department of Water Affairs, which would then ultimately award the contract.    To Bosasa.    Chair, if I could just ask to repeat the question again to me please?    The issue was quite simply that we needed the registration forms from Chiefton to submit to the Minister.  It was at a time when Gavin Watson was seeing the Minister.  He would often meet her at her house.    At the Premier′s house, the Minister.    Chair, Mr Watson would take money with to see to the Minister when he was seeing the Minister.    Chair, is that sufficient or must I give you the amount?    I know the monthly amount was R50 000.    I would have to pack it and he would often deliver it in front of me.    Yes, the house in Eccleston Drive in Bryanston as well as the house in – if I remember correctly it is a name…[intervenes]    Okay, understandable.    Not a problem.    Most definitely.    Frequently.    That is correct.    The monopoly money, the cash.    Yes.    Chair, that was a monthly amount on a few occasions, yes.    I cannot recall the exact period of time, but it is long.    No, Chair, this was years.    Chair, you are 100% right.    Chair, it never ever stopped.  I remember two days before I went on my last leave with Bosasa on 13 December that I actually issued out the instruction that it needs to be – I approved everything.    2016, Chair.    That is right.   I can give it to you.  The one house, especially the house in Krugersdorp where you come into the – it is similar to a cul-de-sac, you go through the gate on your right you will see that there is a security guard house on your right.  You walk straight through, you will find a double garage.  Under the one cover I still remember commenting there was a Vantage parked undercover.  On your right hand side you will find stairways that go up.  As you are going up on the stairways on your left hand side you will find the electrical board which controls the generator as well.  There are little footlights that are problematic, by the way, on the actual walkway intothe front door.  You will then see the swimming pool on your right hand side.  It is a kidney shaped swimming pool, and it was problematic in terms of the fountain, because the fountain kept leaking.  If you go into the house itself you go through the front door.  Very first right you will find her office.    Frequently.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes, I did.    It has got a massive swimming pool.  You go up the driveway.  As you get to the top of the driveway there are four car parks, garages really under the house.  You drive into them.  You then walk around.  You will see a massive swimming pool, it is terraced so the whole house is terraced.  You then walk through the door.  On the left hand side is a waiting room which has got a fireplace.  On the right hand side is a meeting room, which has got a big boardroom table, with about 14 chairs around it.  The furniture is very Italianate, you know the Italian type furniture and then you – those were the two areas we would sit and it has got a beautiful patio, beautiful view.    Chair, at the meeting I was present, Gavin Watson was present, Paul Silvo who was head of the facilities management for Chiefton was present, as well as Raymond Moodley who was the cofounder of Chiefton and who might meet with on various occasions.    I do not know what happened actually afterwards, but Chiefton Consultants were never appointed, and the reason, because they did not comply with the specifications in terms of the contractors.  The specific problem if I recall was their SERA registration and as a consequence Bosasa did not bid for the tender that came out, if it came out.    Chair, I did discuss it with Gavin Watson.  I cannot recall which other Directors were present when I discussed it, but I mentioned, and I was very disappointed that we had spent a lot of effort and a lot of time and a lot of money had been paid out to Mokonyane with hardly any return in terms of value, in terms of like what happened with some of the other people, and the biggest concern was he indicated that I must be very careful, because she has a lot of clout and if you did not do what she wanted him to do we would not have the protection.  We needed her support for the protection from the SIU investigation, the HAWKS and the NPA.And in this discussion I tried to indicate to Gavin that it serves little or no purpose to continue – I remember it vividly.  We spoke about it in the car, outside herhouse and I said it is not serving us any purpose, this corruption and the pay outs that we are making, because it is just getting us deeper and deeper into trouble and eventually this is what is going to close down the business, and that is what is going to put 6 000 families at risk.I pleaded with him that we stop being politically based as a company.  There is no need to do that.    Chair, this was around 2005/2006.    It is when things really started to get a bit much for me.    That is correct.    Chair, I know about them from when I started packing.  I cannot…[intervenes]    You know, I do not want to allude to knowing about it and I did not.  I am being frank and honest…[intervenes]    With you in this commission and I am under oath.   It started when I started packing.    Yes.    No.    I cannot.    It was in 2009, I think.    I have not looked at my notes.    Yes.    Correct.    Chair, it was monthly.    I would not deliver it, Mr Watson would deliver it.    Because he used those times to talk to her about the politics of the day.    Correct.    If there was a serious matter to discuss regarding the NPA like at one stage he wanted a senior person to withdraw the matter from the police I was there, because I would need to have to go back to the attorneys and tell the attorneys exactly what I had been told politically.    That is correct.    I would have to – I would have to, sorry, Chair, I have got so many things in my mind this morning.    But I cannot remember the actual date they started the investigation with the SIU.    I know that it was about that time and I know that there was information starting to come out from the SIU report via the press.    Let me put it into context, Chair.  What I am trying to say is that one does not actually gain from doing that, and quite simply what I was trying to explain to Mr Watson was, the more you give someone, the less they will do for you if you are bribing them, because they do not want to be tainted.  They do not want to be seen as close to you.So I was trying to explain that it is not good to do it that is what I am trying to explain.    Okay.    Yes?    I am not talking about physical money, cash.    I am talking about doing the favours, doing the lekgotlas, being in the forefront, doing the cakes, doing the birthday parties, organising things, that, as soon as people see that you are openly doing it for them they are not going to give them business, because it is too open.  Everybody will know that, oh, you seeBosasa did the birthday cake, they did the functions that is why they are getting business.So what tends to happen is people will then not give the business, because you are giving things to them openly.    Correct.    I was complaining.    That is correct.   That is cash money as well that has been paid to her.    There was no benefit whatsoever that came from it.    From giving her money, no contracts, is that what you are asking me?   Yes.    Yes.    That is right, Chair.    Chair, in the context of getting business there was no benefit.  In the context of stopping the SIU report there was no benefit whatsoever.  It was awaste of time and effort to try and corrupt somebody.    100% correct, Chair.    That is correct, Chair.    He told me that she had a lot of clout and if we stopped doing here, I cannot use the word here, we would have a lot of problems that was what was told.    Sorry, does that give clarity, Chair?    What I was trying to say, Chair, is the discussion emanated, because I was frustrated with him.    And I said, "what are we doing this for anyway″?  Wasting our time.   That is right.    That is correct.    They got contracts and they got extensions.    Correct.    Correct.    Chair, I was aware of the fact that she would be handling Jacob Zuma and the prosecution, but nothing had been forthcoming, nothing whatsoever and it was frustrating me, because it worried me continuously.    She was supposed to have the whole charges withdrawn from – at that stage it was with the SAPS.    Correct.    Well he features further on in the statement quite heavily in terms of the HAWKS investigation and that, and she was going to speak to him and she was going to speak to another person that was mentioned as well.    Correct, if there were charges.    Officially, no, Chair.    It was in general.  Not only for her, but for everybody else aswell.    What I am trying to explain…[intervenes]    What I am trying to say, Chair, is I was getting to a point where I was very frustrated with paying people money, alright, and for what?  We actually did not need to do it to have a good and credible business.  We did not have to be political.  So it was a debate I was having at the time in the car with Mr Watson, that why do wecontinue to pay bribes as a company and one of the examples I used was specifically Nomvula Mokonyane.    The issue, that is correct, Chair.  The issue I had was not that we needed to get the benefit.  That was not the issue that we were not getting a benefit.  The issue was that you had major companies out there that do not need to pay bribes, to be successful.  Why could we not just become a company that was A-political, had no political connections and did not have to pay bribes?  That is the context that this is all being put into.    That is fine.   Yes.    They were corrupt and they produced results, Chair.    Not at all.  What I am trying to say, Chair, if I may?  Is that I honestly believe that based on the fact that a good job was done and that there was no fault with the services, we actually did not need to pay bribes.  We could have gotten the contracts based on credibility.    That is correct.    Chair, your assumption is correct, that is it.  What I was trying to put into context was the whole debate in the car that morning was about do we have to do these things as a company, do we have to continue with them, because I was starting to get fed up with doing these things in general.  Mokonyane was a part of that discussion outside her house.    Yes, Chair.    Yes, Chair, let me put it into perspective, maybe you will understand.  I just come back with Mr Watson, I would drive his car, I would drive all the way back from Summerfields where Mr Matisda is and we were driving in the car and we were discussing the SIU investigation and the NPA and all of that.  In the car I said to him, ″has this all been worth it?  Do you honestly believe that paying bribes and being politically connected actually helps you get business″?  We then went and we parked and we were still talking outside Ms Mokonyane′s house in Krugersdorp and myquestion to him was ″here is a classic example of someone that we have been paying, paying, paying, has not delivered squat″, does that maybe explain the context of the whole thing?    That is correct.    Correct.    Yes.    That is right.    Correct.    That is correct.    I understand the way you see it.    Chair, quite simply the answer that I gave in the affidavit I tried to indicate to Mr Watson that it serves no purpose trying to conduct the business in a political manner or by bribing people.  I was getting sick and tired of having to packmoney for people.  That is the truth.    Chair, the point I was making was quite simply we need to stop paying bribes, because it serves no purpose and we get nothing in return.  That was the point I was trying to make.    Chair, you are 100% correct, but how many people did it hurt and kill in the process?  That is the sad part.    Correct.    That is correct.   That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes, I did.    Chair, it would take me the rest of the afternoon what was said, but in a nutshell I was told that you are in Africa, do as Africa.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    Yes, I could, during 2005/2006, I was introduced to him on a Saturday morning.  I was visiting with Gavin Watson, at the Hyde Park Shopping Centre.  He had gone there specifically for a meeting with Mr Mansell and myself andjust leaning against the wall at a shop that sold record players, B and O I think was the name, was Mr Seopela and it was then that he was first introduced to me.    Not at all.  I have a very good long term memory, Chair.  My short term memory is terrible.    My knowledge was that I was first introduced to Mr Seopela that he was Peter Mokaba′s bodyguard and driver, he was a previous ANC Youth Leader.  He had a LLB degree, but never done his articles.  I was also told, Chair, that he was very close to the previous detail of the late President Nelson Mandela.  I wastold that he was very influential in government circles and he was involved in a major way with Fana Hlongwane from the arms deal.  That is what I was told.    I refer back to November 2004, Chair, because apparently it had been already involved in Bosasa, I just did not know about it.  He was on the payroll as a consultant.  I, at that stage was not allowed to see the payroll so I cannot attest to the exact date, but he was a consultant then and he was being managed by Dr Jurgen Smith and by Gaven Watson.At a later stage he was allowed to utilise, this was in 2006, I think it was, he was allowed to use the Bosasa VIP travel account for his own ends and for people he needed to travel around with.    That is correct.    In 2011 it became more and more prevalent that Gavin needed his assistance and Gavin approached me and said to me I need to buy him a new vehicle, which I ordered for him and I provided him with a company expense card and a company credit card for petrol as well.  And that started happening more, and I know for a fact that there were no deductions made in terms of the travel as well.    Correct.    Yes.    That is correct.  I cannot tell you what information Mr Seopela gave Mr Watson.  I can only tell you what information Watson gave me.  I was not privy to that meeting specifically.   Mr Watson told me to get ready and to be able to draw up a design and to be able to implement a national program for the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.    That is correct.    That is correct and it was to get involved with politicians which he had introduced us to.    And that is why I give the history of Mr Seopela.    I am not aware of that, I cannot recall where he was working.    Chair, I was told by Gavin Watson that the Department ofJustice Constitutional Development are looking to investigate the implementation security systems.  I cannot remember the exact date that, that was actually was told to me.    This will be about the short term memory, it must have been 10.    Yes, he often would tell me who he is working with.    I do not understand that question correctly.  Are you talking only in terms of Correction, Department of Justice and Constitutional Development?    Yes.   Okay.    So Mr Seopela would tell me that he is working with various individuals, they were high level people, DG′s.  There were people that he was working with that I have been introduced to and some that I did not even meet, but I would be told that I would have to prepare money for them so he would say to me that I want you to prepare X amount and these people are benefitting from it as well.   Okay.    Yes.    Do you want me to mention the names, Chair?    Yes, he interacted with them on that level, on ministerial level and he also made sure that he let us know that Bosasa could benefit in high lucrative tenders that were coming out.  Although I was aware of the fact that the money waspaid to Seopela for these unlawful issues, Seopela just asked me for an amount, I would prepare it and I would then raise it with Mr Watson.  Mr Watson would tell me just do as Seopela tells you to do it is fine, he is aware of the people.The cash that was handed over to him was then distributed by him and it happened from until 2016 until I left.  Does that answer your question?    Most definitely he did.   Yes.    Chair, if I may.  I just want to know do you want me to mention who the people were?    Yes?    Correct.    Chair, I am well aware that is the question and my answer tothat is most definitely.  I am just asking you do you need me to give the names?    To verify it?    Yes.    Chair?    That was my answer.    Yes, but I can elaborate if need be.    Yes?    100%.    It was spot on, I was shocked.    As, Chair, as it is contained in 23.7, alright there would be numerous meetings with high ranking government officials.  Often there would be visits as well to the offices of Bosasa would he would accompany us with.  Although I was aware of the fact that the money was paid to Seopela for unlawful purposes to these government officials in turn, I only supplied him with the cash from 2009 onwards and Seopela would just ask for an amount and we would be done, but he was influential andhe was able to get people to do things and get information to us that was accurate that was informative and that assisted the process.Does that answer the question, Chair?    Ja.    That is correct.    Correct, he would.    He would tell me where it was, who, which department it was or what transaction it was happening for.  Sometimes he would not give me all the detail, but at least tell me where it was going to.    That is correct.    It was very broad stroke.  I often would request more detail and he would say no.    Yes.    No.    I did.    Just told me to do what Seopela says.    Chair, that is correct, but I must just add that I would still ask and sometimes he would tell me.    But a lot of times he would not tell me, but if he did not tell me then I would not be able to refuse, because I had an instruction that he has to get paid anyway.    It meant that, but I would still just every time double check and confirm.    With, sorry, Chair, let me clarify.    Even though he had said to me you do not need to check on him I would still check.    So I would still, even if it was a week later I would still turn around and say, by the way he asked for this, this and this.    I would still do that.    I was not just going to just stop it.    Always in the black book, always.    It did not matter, it was always recorded.  I always put it down.   You would have all the detail if we can get the black books.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    They were swapped so we would use one, take one, use one take one.    It would last about six months, seven months.    Sometimes a year.    Yes.    The initial amount was R500 000 a month.    As far as I can see, yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Those were bribes, Chair.    The amount was amended, Chair, increased to R750 000 and this was when the Commissioner was appointed at this stage.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    It was told to me by Seopela.  So I would have to increase the amount that was packed.    His evidence, as I said earlier, Chair, was always very credible.  I never needed to check up.  I did check up in the initial stages and now and again I would do a check, but his evidence in whatever he told me was, he was always very accurate.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I know where it has been and, Chair, quite simply, I mean it is common sense really.   That is correct, Chair.  And if I can put into perspective, I will give you an example.  For instance a letter was written to Mr Moyane by a certain journalist to start quering about why are you retaining Bosasa and it was just simply put away, and when I asked the question is Mr Moyane assisting us?  I was told yes, whathappened with the investigation?  Absolutely nothing happened.  So yes, it was confirmed to me as well.  Does that answer the question?    Thank you.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    In terms of the R500 000 initial I know it was being split up, Chair.    And thereafter I presume with the extra they would have split it to the new additions.    That is correct.    That is correct, Chair.    The grey security bags would be packed in R50 000 and up until R1-million would be packed into a cheap havosack type bag that was bought at the China Mall.    Most definitely not.    He was trusted and he had a reputation and the integrity that he used to transport quite a lot of cash previously and there was never an issue.  From time to time I would check, but we, I would not say that he pocketed the cash.    That is correct, Chair.    I presume so, Chair, that is what I meant.    Yes.    Correct.    Sondolo IT Pty Ltd was a technology solutions provider that provided a singular platform on an IP based infrastructure where we would offer solutions for security, x-ray scanning, various electronic security encounter measures.    Yes, it is.    That is correct.    It had a very lucrative contract, yes.    Correct, if I remember correctly?    That is exactly what it did.    It was about 15-million South African Rands, Chair.    Correct.    I know of four of the names.    Correct.     I know that.    I know that.    Chair, do you want the actual names?  You want me to give them to you?    There was a Ms Masha, there was a…[intervenes]    Ms Masha.    That is all I know.    I think it was M-A-S-H-A.  There was…[intervenes]    It was in security.   It was involved in security.    Correct.    Correct.  There was a gentleman by the name of Norman Thobane.  There was a woman by the name of Mamsie Nyambuse, head of security.    Mamsie Nyambuse.    The fourth one I just cannot remember right now.    Because I was present at some of the meetings and payments.    Yes.    Yes.    Well, are you talking specifically relating to the whole of justice?    Joe Gumede was present and I was present and they were present.    It would have been Joe Gumede.    There were two lots, if you recall, there were two lots.  There is the big amount, which he would also hand over and there were smaller amounts which were handed over.    Well it was small in comparison to that.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes.    That one was specifically one occasion, Chair.    That is correct.    That specific lady I was there on the one occasion.   And it was more than one occasion.    It was normally in a restaurant, there is a – I can remember vividly the sign board at 232 or something, there was a brown sign board in Johannesburg and sometimes it would be at the Protea Hotel, I think it was a Protea in Johannesburg itself.    Pretoria sorry, not Johannesburg, Pretoria.    No, I cannot.    It was 2013/2014 around there.    He was, Chair, he was in an integral part, because he handled the guarding services and he was involved with the security application services as well.   And he was involved with security.  He reported to Ms Mamsie Nyambuse.    I cannot remember exactly how much it was.    I will have to look in my notes, but the amounts, if I am not mistaken, it is in my notes, I think it was between…[intervenes]    Yes.    About five or six occasions.    Correct.    Yes, it was from when we received one of the first contracts, that is correct.    Various places.    As well also restaurants and at one stage I still had to take him to his house.   And I can explain where he stays, but I had to take him there and drop him off there with it.    I took him, I gave him a lift home.    It was only once.    Yes.    Not as good no.    But I would find my way, I would have to think about it.   I will work a way out of getting my memory jogged.    Yes.    I have written it down.    I cannot remember exactly.   There are certain numbers that stick out in my mind and there are certain that I have to go and check.    Yes.    Often we will meet her…[intervenes]    Well the one time I met her on the road whilst with Mr Gumede.    The second time I met her it was actually a restaurant.  The third time, if I recall correctly, it was also a restaurant and I mean I cannot recall the others.   About four/five times.    Yes.    It was the Pretoria to Krugersdorp Road.    And I think it is called the R24 or something.    I am not too sure what the road is called.    It is between Krugersdorp and Pretoria.    I do.  Chair I would like to ask a question at this stage, request.   Make a request.    The request is during lunch I was thinking about the testimony in terms of 22.7 and 22 and I feel that it would be an injustice if I do not tell you and explain a little bit more onto that.    So if I could attend to that first.    Alright.   I think, not I think, I know.  I want to clarify exactly what I meant and explain it in detail to you.  When we first met Nomvula Mokonyane we realised that she was extremely powerful.  As a matter of fact, we actually referred myself and Mr Watson to her as an energizer bunny.  That was the name that we used and the reason for that was because whatever we needed done would be done.  If we needed people spoken to it would be done.  If we needed protection it would be done.  So she was the new person for us and that is why I raised the issue.  I think what is – what is very important to note as well is that we knew that if we had any issues we could go to her and it would be sorted, if you had any issues.    It will be sorted.    Correct.    When …[intervenes].    For instance we knew that she was very close to the President at the time.    Yes.    But even further than that if there were certain people to be spoken to in the Hawks we knew that she would be able to do that and that is why it continued.    Correct, right the way through actually.    Yes.    That is how we explain it in terms of what we got in return and that type of thing, contracts and that, but even though we did not get them the fact of the matter was she was powerful and we had to keep her on our side.  That is what I was trying to get at and maybe I did not explain it properly.    That is – I would just like to add that on to it as well.   And I think what, what the Chair needs to understand is this.  An affidavit was done in the matter of three, four, five days.    It took us a lot of time.    I would like to add supplementaries to it.    As we go on.    But obviously…    It needs a lot of work still.    There is a lot of things …[intervenes].    I have not included in there.    Chair thank you and I appreciate that.  An investigations team will tell you that there is new evidence coming up daily and …[intervenes].    But because of the time constraints.    We did not get to anything.    Okay.  I appreciate that Chair.  My apologies Advocate Pretorius for interrupting.    Yes.   No.    That …[intervenes].   That is correct, sir.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is …[intervenes].    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I was told by Mr Seopela that one of the names mentioned to me at the time was a Chief Operations Officer in the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.  It was Dr de Wee.  Apart from this verbal report I have no other information to confirm the correctness thereof.    At one stage I was told that I was late with packing a delivery.  The amount was in excess of R2 million and I was gold that Dr de Wee was very upset with me, because I was late in getting the delivery to Mr Seopela.    That is what I was told.    I cannot, I cannot confirm or deny that, yes.    Chair that was probably about 2003/2004 if I remember correctly.  2013/2014.   Chair if I can clarify.  When the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development paid us what would happen is 2.5 percent of that payment amount would be put into cash and then paid within that week.  On this specific incident the R2 million was the amount and my understanding was that it was going to a group of people of which he was one as communicated to me by Senior Seopela.    Chair that is correct.  The contract with Kgwerano is called the RT62 Contract is a contract for providing administration and fleet management services to people on the SMS Scheme and I would have to pack R300 000 a month whichwould go via Papa Leshabane to be delivered to various officials.    K-G-W-E-R-A-N-O and it would be Financial Services.    Sorry.    I was the SMS Fleet Services.    Senior Management Services or it could be Subsides Vehicle Services.  I think it was the Senior Management Services.  I am not a Government Official.    So I only knew it as the SMS Chair.   Correct.    That is correct.    You are not misunderstanding it Chair.    So normally Mr Seopela would get it.    And Mr Leshabane …[intervenes].    Would get it to hand it over.    Between the two of them.    That is correct.    If I can clarify Chair.  It says …[intervenes].    At times these monies …[intervenes].    Were given to Leshabane.    So in other words Seopela would normally get.    Other times Leshabane would get it.    Chair when money was due to be delivered to Mr Seopela what would happen was I would phone him and I would say to him the money is ready for collection and he would indicate where I need to meet him.  Sometimes it would be alongside the road.  Sometimes it would be at Monte Casino in the parking lot at the Palazzo Hotel.  Sometime it would even be in Sandton – wherever he was.  Occasionally and quite often it would be in a restaurant, Tashas Morningside or the Fishmonger at the Thrupps Centre in – I think it is – Illovo.  It would be places, various places.  Sometimes it was at a petrol station and, and he would say to me I would need to follow him and then follow him on some obscure road and then stop halfway and then hand it over.    I was told that I must just listen to him.  He knows what he is doing when it comes to those things.  So he knew.    Chair at times I would not be able to.  I would be away or I would be busy and I could not attend to it.  So then I would hand it over to Leshabane or Gumede to, to do the deliveries.    It would happen I would say I did about 70 percent of the deliveries.    Thank you Chair.    Chair …[intervenes].    For the very first time I met Mr Smith, I met Mr Smith atParliament where I tried to get a meeting with him, because he was being very difficult and he would not meet with us.  So I actually went to Parliament and had an appointment with him and he evaded me at that meeting.    He did – he did not want to have anything to do with Bosasa.    He was vehemently opposed to Bosasa.    Because I wanted to explain to him what the company was about and do a presentation.  I recall meeting with his secretary.  I think it is anMs …[intervenes].    Because I thought perhaps I could swing his mind into looking at us more favourably.    I wanted him to work with us.  That is correct.    That is correct.    Purposes I wanted to present to him what the company was actually about, because I did not believe that he knew the full extent of the company and at that stage I honestly thought that by showing him what we do and the development that we have tried he might be swung over not to be only negativetowards us but at least be neutral.    Yes.  I recall the one incident was with regards to the SIU Report where he was openly and very vocal about the SIU Report.  I cannot think of too many other instances save to say that he was very, just very negative.  You could never phone him like you could with other people from Parliament and speak to them about an issue.  He would, he would veer away from you.    2010/2011 the very first time I tried.    He was in the Portfolio Committee of Correctional Services Chair.    That meeting was held in a road in Rivonia Road.  There is a hotel there which has also look like apartments onto it or suites onto it and if you go up Rivonia Road pass the Codfather on the right hand side.  I cannot recall the name of the hotel.    At the meeting was Sesinyi Seopela, Vincent Smith was there. A gentleman by the name of Magagula.  I do not know what his first names were but – and then Winnie Ngwenya.  Those people were all in the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services.    Correct.  I, I did not know about the meeting, but I was collected and picked up by Gavin Watson and we drove to the meeting together.    That is correct.    At the meeting I did not know who the people, who the otherpeople involved were.  I had known Vincent Smith, because I had seen him on television.  It became evident to me then that those were all members of Parliament and they were part of the Standing Committee on Correctional Services.    Mr Smith alluded to us in the meeting and he had spoken as if he had had a relationship with Gavin - formed a relationship with Gavin at a prior meeting and that three was a working relationship going forward between Correctional Services and Bosasa and the Portfolio Committee.    The main topic of the discussion was during the meeting it was decided that all the individuals who were there would ensure at the parliamentary committee meetings that negative media coverage against Bosasa would not preclude any further tenders going forward or business or extensions going forward and in returnthey would get benefits.    [Intervenes].    Correct.    That is right.    Well what was agreed at the meeting was that despite the fact that there was a lot of negative press publicity, despite the fact that there would be issues raised in the press that were in essence against Bosasa that the parliamentary committee who would normally have raised it as well in the parliamentary committee they would keep quiet on it and they would make sure that they could manage it so that it would not stop Bosasa from getting new business or preclude any potential extensions and growth.    I did not know at the time.  I found that out after the meeting.  Normally what happens is in Portfolio Committee Meetings which I do watch you wouldsee the Chairperson come make a statement and then others comment, but there are normally quite a few people.  So one does not take notice of the individuals.  Only at that meeting was I told that Magagula and the lady by the name Winnie Ngwenya was part of the Portfolio Committee Meeting.    Magagula, sorry.    Correction.    Well at the meeting basically they agreed that there was an agreement previously made amongst them with Gavin and this is what was agreed at the meeting.    Yes.    That agreement apparently had taken place at the previous agreement with Gavin Watson.  If you read, if you go back to, if I can refer you back Chair …[intervenes].    To 24.1.    Sorry.  I think it is 24 point, let me just find it here, sorry. During this meeting – 24.1 the fourth line – during this meeting it became evident to me that these that those individuals were all members of Parliament and members of the Standing Committee on Correction.  Vincent Smith also alluded to a previous discussion with Gavin Watson relating to the working relationship between the Department of Correctional Services and Bosasa.  So there was a meeting prior to that as well.    That is correct.    I learnt that at the meeting that I had with them.    That is correct.    It was not discussed it was merely confirmed Chair.    I was told by Gavin Watson at the meeting in front of them Chair to make sure that these amounts are paid.    That is correct.   The amounts was for Vincent Smith R45 000,00, Magagula R30 000,00, Winnie Ngwenya R20 000,00.    Monthly.    They were made.    Because I packed them and initially Chair what happened withthose payments they were made by Gavin Watson and Seopela but then I was trusted and occasionally when – after I had made up the packages I was occasionally entrusted to actually make those payments when Gavin was unavailable.    I would – I would get hold of either Seopela or I would get hold of Vincent Smith and find out where the other people were.  If they were not available I would hand over everything to Smith and he would handle the distribution thereof.    There were many occasions, specific occasion?    I cannot remember the exact date but off the top of my head Mugg and Bean, Clearwater at the Mezzanine level.    Yes I would.    I was not part of the negotiations so I cannot actually answer that.    Chair there would be follow-up meetings and sometimes the payments would take place there.  For instance one of the parliamentarians, Winnie Ngwenya was living close by so she would attend at the office and actually come and fetch her payment there.    Correct.    No I am not aware of where her house was.    Correct.    Correct.    Sometimes I would have to drive out to Florida and actually do the payment there for Mr Smith.  So there were various places where it took place.    It all happened in Gauteng.    No it would be any time she – I would have to carry it around with me unfortunately until I had come across them and we could sort it out.    Correct.    That is correct.    I cannot recall doing it to him personally.  I know that there was an occasion where he was given a package in front of me but I cannot confirm that it was that package that I had packed.    That is correct.   Some of the places would be at Mugg and Bean on the Mezzanine level.  There were two places that we predominantly meet one being Mugg and Bean at the Mezzanine level.  He would always wear leather jackets so that he could put it inside his jacket or have a folder so that we could try and put it into the folder.  Alternatively I would buy a newspaper to deliver it to him.  The other place was a Greek restaurant I cannot recall the name at Cradlestone Mall on the left hand side on the entrance.    No I was present when he got one delivery.    I was there and I saw it.  I did not do the delivery though I did not hand him cash.    I cannot.    Chair I cannot recall at the moment other than she would come to the office quite frequently and get it.    Correct.   Correct and her husband was her driver and her chauffer.    Well maybe the word buy a newspaper is incorrect because I had newspapers delivered to my office Chair.    Correct I would take the newspaper with me so that it would not be too obvious.    I would …[intervene].    Chair if I had to meet in a restaurant irrespective if he had a leather jacket on I would not walk in the restaurant with one of those grey bags.  And I did not walk around with my briefcase because it would – there would nine out of ten times rob me.  So I would always take it in a paper.    Thank you.    That is correct he did.    At one stage he was uncomfortable with Mr Seopela being the middle man so to speak.  So he actually said me that “you know let us rather deal directly with each other” he did not want Seopela as a go between.  So we played along and we agreed with him that Seopela would be excluded and basically we just told Seopela that he does not want to see us anymore.   It was during 2015, 2016.    That is correct Chair we tried to create that perception.    Could you just repeat the beginning part of your question?    That is correct.    The payments would – were stopped.    Well they were increased to R100 000,00 per month.    Gavin Watson would hand them to him at the various meetings.    No Chair if I may respond he requested it and it was increased.    That is correct.    (Indistinct) Chair.    Ten, eleven times.    Ten or eleven times I was available – I was there.    Correct.    No he was not always available.    I would handle – hand it over mostly.  That is how it worked.    There were.    I think it was every second week literally that they had those meetings.    Well purpose of those meetings was to brief us on the activities of the department.  The other reason was also because he would intervene ifwe had problems with Zach Modise who was appointed as the National Commissioner of Correctional Services.  So we put – we would also use him to put pressure on the National Commissioner to ensure a favourable attitude towards Bosasa at all times.    Could you repeat that question please?    He said if decisions needed to be made he could make them favourable towards Bosasa.   It is very, very clear Chair.  What needs to happen is that in a Portfolio Committee meeting they need to come to some sort of an agreement – a consensus when a point is raised.  So if somebody had to be negative and let us say that Bosasa had been awarded a second contract to do the catering at Groenpunt you did not want negativity coming from the – from the Portfolio Committee.  So we could get it past a point but then when it got to Portfolio if you did not have your ducks in a row and you had not gotten people in place you would get negativity and then it will rumble back and they could make your life very difficult as the Portfolio Committee.     So even though they might not have the power to award or distribute or allocate tenders they have a very strong ability to make life difficult for the person and to raise objections and that type of thing.    That is one hundred percent correct.    Yes Chair there was an incident where it occurred.    Chair I am not too exactly sure what kind of crime incident happened there but it was an incident of crime and Gavin Watson offered to install a security system and a camera system at the house.  He just offered it.  So I had to instruct Richard Le Roux who was one of the employees to implement a cathexis video serving system.  So that was a specific video which allowed you to view off site monitoring, that type of thing.  They needed to sort out his alarm system.  There was fencing that needed to be done.  Alarm panel – beams had to be put up around the garden. There was hardware such as gate motors put in, access control put in, that type of thing.    These payments for the equipment would normally be made in cash.  So they would bring the requisition and the invoice and it would be listed probably in a cash sale probably in my name or whoever else’s name and that then would be printed out and it would be paid.  So you would only get a delivery note that goes with the goods which was great because nobody saw the information of how much it cost.    Well the duty to see to the installation of the systems wasactually Richard Le Roux’s and whoever I would nominate to go and do it.    If I am not mistaken he was employed by Bosasa Group of Companies a division thereof called Sondolo IT.    Correct.    In terms of the – you asking me a double question.  You saying that the com – that the equipment was paid in cash and under whose name was it installed?    It was installed by a team that was developed called the Special Projects Team.    They worked for [intervenes]   Well for the installation it would have been Concilium Consultants if I remember correctly.    Let me just check my notes, sorry.      Sorry I am actually ahead of the pack here.  Sorry just repeat your question again please?    Well it was the Special Projects Team that was headed up by Richard Le Roux.    Sondolo IT.    That is correct.    That is correct.    It has been provided.  There is invoices and also a statement of Richard Le Roux.    That is [intervenes}    That is correct.  I was requested by Mr Gavin Watson to make a payment for Mr Smith’s daughter to study at Aberystwyth University overseas and this was made by a cash deposit into an account called Euro Blitz.  Mr Jacques Van Zyl made the deposit at FNB on instruction.   Gavin Watson.    Chair.    That is right.    Chair if I can give you the information on this.  This is a copy of a document which I received alright.  What happened was when the copy was made the little bank slip was put on the top right hand corner and that is why some of thewriting is not very clear?  You will see there it is an email from his daughter Brumilda Smith to Vincent Smith at anc.org.za and it talks about the fees and it says that the fees for the next …[intervenes].    The date is the 5 July 2016.    And it says there that the fees for the next academic year are $10 500,00.    And that comes from a email which was sent from a certainAlison to Ms Brumilda Smith.    Yes.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That document is a bank deposit of – to the amount of R276 667,90 made at an FNB bank and this was made in Krugersdorp.   That is correct.    Correct.    Chair as far as my understanding – my memory serves me it is the same and it provides for costs to do the transfer as well.    Correct.    Correct.    Well considerable – you need to consider the fact that there was more than one fees paid.    That was for further payments for the university fees.    Sorry for the previous years – for the previous payments for the university fees.  So it was a balance of.    Correct.    Further payments.    Correct.    Correct but if I can also add if you look at the stamp date on the top there you will see that because of the – the quality of the paper if you have alook right at the top underneath where it says AA271 it is not legible the actual deposit slip for that one.    Correct.    No, no let me correct you.    If you look at AA271.   That is a payment made on 2016-07-29.  July is the seventh month so it was paid on the 29 July 2016.    Yes let me explain to you again.  The reason why you see half the words are cut off on the email is because the slip was attached to this when it was photostated.    Okay.    Correct it is not 2015 it is 2016.    07-29.   And the other one is the continuation of the payment.  That was the first payment made to – 14-07-2015 or 18 I cannot see my glasses are ...[indistinct].    There were a few payments.    It is possible yes.    No they both went to Euro Blitz.    Unfortunately the slip has actually deteriorated.    No, it is not the same.    The documents at 271 and 272 and then you go to documents 273 which is a company report that I have pulled, because I wanted at first to check who the company EuroBlitz – I wanted to confirm who it was and if you look at page 274 it is reflected Smith, Vincent George and the address coincides with the address where it had been stationed.    Correct.    They are related yes.   That is correct.    That is correct.    Hm.    If you read, if you read 24.10.  It says   Yes, we can.    Chair, Mr Smith made statements and put out a press release that in fact he had a personal loan with myself which is totally incorrect.  There was no such thing.  He did approach me for a loan and what he offered to do was to sell me his    Yes, I …[intervenes].    I did not know him.  Why would I give him loans?    He made a request for a loan when I had already left Bosasa.    So what I am saying that …[intervenes].    He made the request for a loan in cash.   I did not know him then anymore.  I did not – I was not interested in him.    And he approached me to come to me with the shares that he had in Vorna.  There is a life hospital I think there and he brought me documentation and I said to him I was not interested.    It is well after I left.  This was in 2017/2018.    Once more there was a newspaper report and he said – and they asked me about it.  They sent questions to me.  I said well this is what happened.  You know, ask Bosasa.  I definitely do not know anything about it Mr Smith’s dealingsanymore and that is how it came up in Parliament and he then raised it.  My understanding is that, you know, he tried to make it out as if I had loaned him the money and I did not.  I paid him the money on instruction from Gavin Watson, simple as that.    It was well after I had left Bosasa.  So …[intervenes].    Yes.    No, it was before that he asked me for a loan.    That is true.    That is the sequence, sir.    That is correct.    Patrick Gillingham was introduced to me at the Lindela Repatriation Facility.  I would say in 2013, mid to late 2013.   Then there – sorry, 2003 that is right.    I am sorry.  I get confused sometimes.    2003.    That is correct.    I did not know Patrick Gillingham from a bar of soap.  I did not know who he was.  The only thing I knew was that he was supplying beef four quarters to one of the Department of Correctional Facilities.  That is all I knew.  At the stage I was running the butcheries for Dyambu and Bosasa and I knew that we had to deliver whenever they phoned.  It was rare.    The beef was C3 Grade.    When I – Chair could I have clarity.  When I met him at Lindela?    I have never been in the Army or the Defence Force or the Police.  I saw a lot of brass and I thought he was extremely important.  I did not know what position he held.   No, I knew, sorry Chair.  I knew it was a Correctional Services, but I did not know what their rank status was and that.  Actually I was not interested in, in it at all.    That is right.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.  I did not even know that that he was involved at that stage with the supply of beef or that it was his contract or anything like that.  I did not even put two and two together.    The beef contract?    I would merely do the deliveries.  Apparently I found out afterwards that was being handled by Paul Vorster.    Well the – you are talking about the contract or the liaison with Mr Gillingham?   That was taken over later by Danny Mansell, because Patrick, because Paul Vorster passed away.    Mr Gavin Watson introduced me to Mr Patrick Gillingham.    Chair at the time …[intervenes].    At the time …[intervenes].   At the time with Mr Gillingham I was told that we would be working very closely with Mr Gillingham by Mr Watson.  I was busy.  I was at the moment, at that stage I was busy doing a quality audit at Lindela and in preparation for an ISO accreditation.  So I was not too interested in, in who he was working with and showing around, but I recall him telling me that we are going to be working very closely with him.    At that stage Mr Watson wanted to get rid of the existing catering contracts at the mines and he wanted to venture into new ventures.    He wanted to get involved specifically with security contracts, Government contracts and state owned enterprises.   No, catering facilities management.    That as well.    Well you recall that the mining industry went through a very rough patch during those years.  There were always problems with payments.  There were delays in payments and he, he simply wanted to get out of that business.    Yes.  Chair, if I may during the course of 2004 Bosasa received a training contract from the Department of Correctional Services.  I had nothing to do with that contract.  I was not even aware of it until such time as Dr Jurgen Smith actually invited me to a function where they were – it says in my statement invited me to a function for the awarding of the contract.  That is incorrect.  I would like to correct that.  It just – it was for the awards evening at the contract.  If I can give – explain it to you.    If you look at 25.6.    It invited me – the fourth line.  It says   So it is supposed to say …[intervenes].    It is supposed actually read   Because later on you will see I say that this function appeared to be coordinated by Dr Jurgen Smith and Mark Taverner.  So what had happenedChair if I can give it perspective.    The function that was held was a function I did not even know that we had been given this contract to train and it was to train senior officials at the various Correctional Services units on the implementation of Act 111 which included catering.  It is what it means.  Does that answer your question?    Sorry.  It was the training I found out subsequently, because I did not know about this contract Chair, but the training was a prelude to train up people to act, to comply with the meal intervals of Act 111 of some or other Act.    Correctional Services Act, yes.    So it was a training program for these officials.  I was awarded– I only found out about this contract when they were doing the awards evening for, for the people who attended.  So I attended and I was – it was the first time I knew about that contract specifically.    Commenced – it was, it was in progress.    I cannot remember if it was done on the same day, but it was the evening.    I went to the evening it was awards.    I do not know how long the training …[intervenes].    I had no, I had no information on that.    Yes.  I remember people getting awards.    Okay.    This function was coordinated by Dr Jurgen Smith and Mark Taverner.  He was a Bosasa employee.  Mark was also the brother-in-law of Gavin Watson.  It was all new to me.  They continued with it.  I was just invited by Dr Smith who I saw as a mentor.    That is correct.    I was not aware that Taverner was in anyway involved with furnishing of, of Mti and Gillingham’s houses and perhaps that is why I was not told about the very first contract for the training, because perhaps they did not want me to know about it but at the beginning of 2004, you know, I believe that they started with the renovation, with buying furniture, building of the houses and all that type of thing.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    At the beginning of 2004 Chair I met Gillingham for the second time.  Gavin Watson informed me that the company - this was just the day before – that the company and some of the other employees of Bosasa Operations had to attend a tour of the prisons around the country with Gillingham and we had to evaluate the catering needs and the concerns of Correctional Services and we had to create a blueprint for the catering services.  So my understanding at that stage was we are going around.  We are going to draw up a blueprint.  We are going to identify what the needs are, where the problems are and establish from their training and that type of thing.  That was my understanding, but we were also told not to wear Bosasa uniform.  So Bosasa had a very distinct uniform, blue shirts similar to what I am wearing today,blue ties and we were not to wear uniforms.  We had to be in plain clothes and we were not to be identified as Bosasa and the tour would be coordinated by Danny Mansell and Patrick Gillingham who we seem to have had a good relationship at the time.    Most definitely.    Myself, Frans Vorster, there was a gentleman by the name of Hennie Viljoen, Danny Mansell.  There was Patrick Gillingham as well.    His skills are in linguistics, transportation purchasing.    And vehicles and delivery of cement and all that type of thing.    He is more on the maintenance and the technical side and that is to do specifically with facilities management and catering services.    Mr Mansell was a business consultant and I remember he was previously the owner or 50 percent owner of Dyambu.    That is correct.    Well we started off at Johannesburg establishment.  The reason I remember Johannesburg was because of …[indistinct] Davids who, who was very, helped us a lot.  Then we went to Port Elizabeth.  We went to Durban, Cape Town, Pretoria and …[indistinct].    Well those were in the management area.  If I remember correctly it is probably about 26 of the facilities, but once you have seen one you have seen them all really.  So I cannot recall an exact number.   So in order to do a proper comprehensive report Chair to be able to understand what is happening there we would spend a lot of time in the facilities.  Talk to the offenders, talk to the officials who were running it and then also talk to the staff, you know, in the facility itself so that we gain as much information as possible.    Yes, the idea behind the whole operation was to be able to produce a blueprint and to say these are the issues, these are the current costs which you would be able to ascertain.  These are where the faults are.  This is what needs to be done and this is the type of equipment you would require to improve the services and make it more economically viable, yes.    Yes.    Well it will most definitely give you the edge, because you would know exactly what to do.    As far as I know Bosasa paid for the hotels and the flights that were prebooked by Bosasa probably by Blakes Travel, but I do not have first-hand knowledge on the bookings or the payment of the invoices.    Well I paid for the Bosasa employees and I did not pay for Gillingham at all.    Well the report I would have submitted to Gavin Watson and Danny Mansell.  You know I had to file it.  I had to do a whole lot of additional work.  I wanted to add to it.  I wanted a professional report come out of it.    Well Chair catering is catering really.  If I can just put – if I can explain it, because I do not want to be found short not explaining it.  Catering is catering whether you are catering in a hospital or you are catering in a, in a detention facility.  It is exactly the same.  The mechanisms used are the same.  The processes used are the same.  The only difference is you have higher security or not.  So what Iwanted to do was enhance it by bringing in catering security systems.  So things like scanning bags of mielie-meal before they went to the [background noise], sorry before they went to the stores.  Things like that to prevent smuggling and that.  So I gave a task to one of the people that worked for me.  A guy by the name of Johan Helmut, asked him to continue and design a solution that we could implement or show the department.    Well he designed me, he designed me that and I include, incorporated into my final report and specification layout.    The report was finalised and after all the comments and final approval it was given by Gavin he then gave me two email addresses.  I recall it vividly.  He wrote it down on a…    Sorry.  It was written on a piece of paper and it was in his handwritten.  It looked more like Danny Mansell’s handwriting and I was given two email addresses and told that it is where you email it to and the one was Kobus@bfm.co.za, stokkies@bfm.co.za.    Yes.    I cannot recall exactly which – right now.  It is in my statement,but I cannot, which is which.  It was Mansell and Gillingham.  So it was at Bloemfontein.co.za and Bloemfontein.co.za.  So it was for Mansell and Gillingham.    That is correct.    At first I believed that Bosasa was acting as a consultant for the Department of Correctional Services.  I thought it was to assist them in determining exactly what they, what was necessary in their facilities.  At that stage I did not actuallyknow that this document would become a specifications documents that would be used as an invitation to bid for a tender document.    Never.    No, I was told that it is a blueprint that they are looking at.    No, no.  Bearing in mind that we were doing the youth centres and the Lindela Repatriation Facility we had that knowledge.  So to me it was plausible that we are being asked to draw up a blueprint for them.  There are many times that we were asked to draw blueprints for child justice and things like that which we did.  So I thought this was one of those things.    That is correct.    When the bid came out I was told that, you know, we have to tender for it.    Yes.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I am well aware of that Chair.    The bid was advertised on the 21 May 2004.    Chair I mentioned it to Mr Gavin Watson.  I said to him that there is large portions not everything but there were large portions that were identical to the specification that I had submitted and the Analysis Report that I had submitted to Mr Mansell.  Even at one stage the conclusion appeared to had been used in the specifications document which formed part of the invitation to bid on the cateringtender.    As always Mr Watson had it all under control.    That is exactly what he told me.  He told me just to do it.  He is going to be awarded the contract.  I must just do the paperwork.    He told me that it would be awarded to Bosasa I must just keep quiet, keep my head down and just do the paperwork and fill in the tender that is what he meant.    I had a team that compiled the response to the invitation to bid.   That is right.  All bids fell under my supervision.    It was Chair on the 20 July 2014.    That is correct Chair.    Initial contract was a three year contract.   Well the annual value reflected was R239 427 694,00 per annum.    It seems to be the 27 July 2004.  I think once more Chair because we had limited time this was a condensed.    This was actually condensing the original statement from about 240 pages to try and get it into about 90.    Will do Chair.   Chair the costings were manipulated if I may add that.  So we – we were told to cost on special meals and normal meals.  Special meals or high protein diets, diabetic diets, various diets that are required.  We were told that that constitutes ten percent of the hundred percent of the meals charged.  Now if I can put that into perspective for you.  Ninety percent of the meals would be special – normal meals.  Normal meals would be charged at say R10,00 a meal per person per day.  Special meals are exactly the same type of meal just prepared slightly differently.  There is no addition to it.  They might very well be cheaper than a normal meal –special meal.  We would charge R20,00 per meal, double the price.  Although it was exactly the same product.  But the interesting thing is when you did your cross-calculations and you worked on the 90/10 principle you would come in with a total figure of say R239 427 000,00.  However truth be told the special meals were considerably higher they were running at about thirty percent and normal meals were running at seventy percent.  So in actual fact the R239 million that is reflected there was actually understated and that once you had finished the month and costed out everything you would be on average thirty-five percent higher.  So although the bid was submitted for R239 427 000,00 if they do the analysis they will note that in actual fact they probably would have paid closer to the R310 million versus the R239 million for the first year.  That is how it was manipulated.    Correct so it would be geared at that price.    Because you would be charging them on actual meals served and therefore your price would come out at much higher.    On instruction from Gavin Watson I was told to make a proposal to Gillingham that there were seven satellite correctional centres that we should have included in the catering tender itself.  I know that the time that this had been negotiated and discussed with Danny Mansell and with Gillingham Chair and I also know that when the instruction was given to me there was a specific reason for it.  Mti had also approved this.  The expansion of that contract was fully approved and all Ineeded to do was provide a price for it.    It is Richmond Linda Mti.    He was a National Commissioner of Correctional Services at the time.    That expansion was R14 million extra per month.    No this would have had to go through a new tender process and everybody was aware of that.  Everybody was just too scared to make that comment – to make that suggestion that it should be fixed up.   Never.    Correct.    Every single staff member in the company got increases thatyear.    There were substantial increases.    Chair I would have to flip back to that specific date.  As I said earlier my wife unfortunately takes all my money so I would not know.  I would need to have a look.      Correction sorry Chair.  There was substantial increase.    And I also had – they painted out my house for me.    I can.  I can most definitely check.  Chair it went up from R234 000,00 to R406 000,00.    You are right she probably took ninety percent of that anyway.    Yes.   Yes Chair.    Correct that is correct.    That is correct Chair.    I was – I was aware of the under-costing but the costings wereactually completed and finalised by Mr Mansell.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.   It was about R30 000,00.    That is correct.    I am…    Okay no it is the same.    That is correct.   If I remember correctly it was in November 2004.    The meeting was their monthly meeting and we were asked to do a presentation on the progress of the implementation of the catering tender.  And also to showcase some of the other services that we could provide.  So that was the first time I really met Richmond Linda Mti and the third time I had encountered Gillingham.  Although I did not interact with Gillingham or Mti because they were in a formal environment and we were very reserved in how we reacted or how we spoke tothem.    A number of directors Chair attended the meeting with me.  Mansell and Watson however did not.    In total from correction side and from Bosasa side there were a total of about forty people that attended.    No he did most definitely but he did not really interact with us.  He was interacting with his people.    Gavin Watson said that he had received very good feedback from Mr Mti and it was very positive.  I was then also told that there was something else in the pipeline namely an access control contract.    Correct.    Correct.    I was given an instruction by Watson and Mansell to once more draft a specification document for an access control system that would beadvertised.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Chair that is correct.    Chair I was told that I needed to draft it in such a manner that no it was a foregone conclusion that Bosasa would or at that time it was Sondolo that would be awarded the contract.  I was told to make sure that you put in restrictiveclauses. One of them was ISO standards, things like that.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.  Would you like me to give you examples?    So one of them would be that they had to have worked in a secure care environment.    The applicant would have to have worked in a secure careenvironment.  In other words a prison.    Or a detention facility.    So that you had the skill and training to work with offenders or amongst offenders.    Another point would have national key points that you must be a national key points accredited service provider.  There is not many people that have that.  So those are the restrictive clauses that were put in.   At the instance of Mr Watson and Mr Mansell.    Correct Chair.    Well Department of Correction has supplied Mansell with an overview of their needs and more or less what they needed to be achieved and I then used Johannesburg Correctional Facility to model it and to provide the blueprint around it.    Always.   Yes I did.    It was mailed.    I gave it to Gavin Watson.    Who would have a look at it?    He was not very interested but he said it was fine I must justsend it to Danny and to Patrick.    That is correct.    I cannot.    I do not know which one was Stokkies and which one was Kobus so it was Danny Mansell and Patrick Gillingham.    Yes.    Sorry Chair.    I am not used to these cross-questioning and …    No problem.    Could you repeat that question, subsequent?    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    If I remember correctly I think it was the 4 February 2005.    Well I was asked to bid under Bosasa Security PTY LTD.    I started to prepare for it yes.    No – sorry Chair there – before the document was submitted and that is maybe why sometimes it gets confusing.  Before the document was submitted, the actual bid document the last minute Gavin Watson said change it to a new company called Sondolo IT.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    It was about the April 2005 we were actually awarded that contract.    That is correct, that is correct.   The contract’s initial period was a two year contract.  It was then later expanded.    Well it was all well and fine that they had this beautiful system but they did not have anybody to manage it so that it was extended in terms of a control room contact and where we basically were paid to manage control rooms for the department.    At – if I recall correctly it is 66 sites.    Just that value was about R240 million around there.    My correction R236 997 385, 31.   Chair they had captured the department.  So the – it was inevitable that the R236 million which was budgeted was going to be exceeded.  They – who was going to – you see Chair if I may explain?  You had this beautiful system, stateof the art but who was actually going to run it?  We knew at that stage that unless they took the proper measures and employed the right staff that the system would fall flat.  So you had them in your clutches because now you would have to employ people and train them up to actually run the system and keep them there for the rest of time.    Yes.    Yes.    Because you now had to pay and I think the amount that they paid every month was an additional R7.8 million rand per month.  Because now you had to staff it.  So it was never budgeted for.    Yes Chair.    There was most definitely.    Correct.    Correct.    It was an emergency so it would have been authorised automatically.  So it was an emergency for – because they needed to run the control rooms.  So it was authorised in terms of the departments’ processes but it never went out on tender.    For the staffing.    Correct.   Correct.    That is correct.    Potentially – I need to.   No that is over two years.    Yes I was.    At the meeting I was told by Ishmael Dekhane who was at that stage Mncwaba Gumede and Leshabane that I was doing a phenomenal job and I was told to trade in my old Audi A6 for a new Audi A6 and the company would basically cover the shortfall which they did with everybody but specifically – specific here it was mine.  They would cover the shortfall it was about R174 000,00 and Dr Smith handled the whole transaction.    Correct.  That is correct.   That is correct.    Most definitely.    Chair I would have to check.    Sorry.    We had     I am not too sure.    Thank you.    As it pleases the Chair.    Yes and you had a statement that you were going to make tomorrow. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:     Good afternoon.  May we proceed?    Yes, Chair.   Yes, that is in order, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.  Mr Agrizzi we ended on the last occasion you gave evidence on page 35 of your statement.  Perhaps, but before we deal with your evidence this morning, Chair, may I place on record some additions tothe bundles?    Firstly the index has been updated to add Annexures CC and DD and those Annexures will appear in EXHIBIT S2 of the bundle.  So you will see the index at the beginning, the index appears in…[intervenes]    Yes, the index is in Bundle S1, but it appears after the first divider.  In other words after the statement.    Yes, perhaps it should, but for the present it does appear after the first divider.    It does deal with the affidavit, the first item.    But for now DCJ the index has been updated.  There are two additions to the papers.    They are Annexures CC.    And Annexures DD.    Annexure CC is the full SIU report.    Through some error only part of the report is in the original bundle.  So rather than remove it and replace it we have just added the full report at the end.  So the full report is Annexure CC and we will deal with that in evidence today or tomorrow.    The other one, Annexure DD, is what?  DD?  Is an article that appeared in the press and we will deal with that in due course.    Then there is a new exhibit, EXHIBIT S8.  You will recall, Chair, that we dealt at some length in evidence with the allegations in the affidavit ofMr Petrus Venter.  Annexure S8 comprises the Annexures to that affidavit, in which documentary and corroborative evidence exists to which we will refer in due course, and that is Annexure – sorry EXHIBIT S8, and it is a separate file which you do not have to have before you today.    Well, it has been given to your Registrar.    So it has been handed up, but not placed on your desk.    It has been marked, EXHIBIT S8.    Yes.    Okay.  Then Mr Agrizzi if we may return to yourevidence?  Page 35 of your affidavit and go to paragraph 21.1.  There you deal with an incident that is indicative of the relationship between yourself and Gavin Watson, would you tell the, Chair, briefly what happened on 7 July 2000?    And generally how did he act towards you and your family?   Alright.  Now you say in paragraph 21.2 of your affidavit that from about 2003 the business of Bosasa Operations started to change and that you will deal with this in more detail below.  That is merely by way of a headline.  We will come to that in due course.  On page 36 of your affidavit you deal with certain events relating to Mokonyane?    Who was she at the time in relation to Bosasa and its predecessor?    Was she, to your recollection and knowledge, was she a Shareholder of Dyambu Holdings or a Director of Dyambu Holdings?    May I just add, Chair, the investigation team dealing with this evidence is checking all the directorships and shareholdings with all the related companies and that evidence will be placed before you in due course.   Before referring to the letter we would obviously like to look at it before it is placed into evidence.    Thank you, Chair.    Do you recall, Mr Agrizzi, during 2002/2003 what position Ms Mokonyane held in government?    Alright.  Did Gavin Watson give you any instructions in relation to the provision of benefits to Ms Mokonyane?    22.3?    Yes?    You say in your statement that a list of items was provided on the instruction of Gavin Watson.  Would you just place those on record please?    Well, we will come to that in a moment.  Where did you get the product from and how were they accounted for?    Who arranged for delivery?   And after the period during which you say you arranged for it initially?    Were further instructions given to you by Gavin Watson after 2002 in relation to Ms Mokonyane?    Before you go on, through whom did you arrange therental?    Alright.  Yes, further instructions?    Rallies, which rallies are you referring to?    For whom?    And then you referred to catering?    And then you refer in paragraph 22.5.4 to catering.  Provide some detail to the, Chair, if you would?    Alright.  Would you go to page 268 please?  That is Annexure G.    And on page 269 appears a photograph?    Would you tell the, Chair, please what you know of what is depicted on that photograph?    Do you have any experience in cake design?    So did you design this one?    Alright, if you look at the cake you will see the ANC flag, ANC colours and a 72 on the top of the cake and to the left a flag, happy 72nd birthday.  Do you see that?    Does the Bosasa logo appear anywhere on this photograph or on the cake?   Alright, well I am not sure I can see it…[intervenes]    Thank you, Mr Agrizzi.  Then in 22.5.5 you relate another benefit, what is that?    And what role did you play personally in the provision of these benefits?    Yes, alright, you say that was soon after 2002?    Alright, what happened in 2008 and 2009 as related in paragraph 22.6 of your affidavit?    Before you go on I think the, Chair, may want to ask a question relating to your previous paragraph.    Thank you, Chair.    Alright.  So in 2008 and 2009 as I understand your evidence Ms Mokonyane approached Bosasa with a request to do an analysis of security at hospitals?    And you in fact on the instruction of Gavin Watson did such an analysis?   And you prepared a report?    To whom did you give the report?    Alright, and do you know its fate after that?    Alright, I intend to deal with related matter, over the page, Chair.    Thank you.  If you go to page 38 please, paragraph 22.7?  In relation to the analysis of security at hospitals that you prepared and handed to Mr Gavin Watson and learned that it had been provided to Ms Mokonyane by him, you were told or given certain information by Papa Leshabane, what was that information?    Right, what post did Mr Nkabinde occupy at that time?    Alright, you do not have original information in relation to the fate of that tender, do you?    Alright, what you are telling the, Chair, is based on reports that you received from Mr Leshabane?    Alright.  Now that is what I wanted to ask you about.  The further investigation are you prepared to cooperate in that respect?   Alright, what happened…[intervenes]    Can you recall the content of your analysis, just very broadly and in summary?    Do you know of any payment that Bosasa might have received for producing this report?    Alright, okay.  Then if we could move on to 2014, or perhaps before we go there, can you recall anything further in relation to security at hospitals and in particular whether Bosasa or a Bosasa company ever bid for the awardof the tender?    Alright, let us move on then to 2014, what happened then in relation to Bosasa and Ms Mokonyane?    Do you know…[intervenes]    Paid for what, for the report?    Yes.  So approximately what was the cost to Bosasa in preparing a report?    Yes.  What was the scope of the report?  You mentioned securing the dams?  Just tell the, Chair, the report you prepared was all about?    Did you understand at the time why this report was being prepared?    Well let us take it step by step.  You were instructed to recommend a consultant.  A consultant to the Department of Water Affairs?    And the consultant′s task would be to manage the award of a tender for securing the dams?    Did you then schedule a meeting or was a meeting scheduled with an institution called Chiefton Consultants?     And was a meeting held?    And very briefly what happened at that meeting?    Did you discuss with Chiefton the contemplated specifications of the project?    So at this stage had any tender invitations been issued?    So…[intervenes]    So before any bid or invitation to bid was issued, before the tender documentation was issued in relation thereto you had not only on behalf of Bosasa prepared a detailed analysis of what was required to secure the dams in South Africa, but you also discussed the specifications of the project with a consultant who it was contemplated might actually manage the whole tender process?    And you discussed with them, according to your evidence, the specifications of the contemplated project.  Did you discuss their potential role as consultants to the Department of Water Affairs for the tender?    Was any expectation expressed to the consultants in relation to who would be awarded the tender?   What was discussed?    Pro the Bosasa group?    Well what does that mean in relation expressly to the award of the tender?    Just by way of background Mr Agrizzi if you go back to paragraph 22.9 you say in that paragraph you received an instruction from Gavin Watson in relation to the issues just raised by the, Chair.  What was that instruction?    To whom?    And then in paragraph 22.10.4 it appears that you discussed another issue at this meeting.  What was that issue?    You refer in paragraph 22.10.4 of your affidavit to a further issue that was raised at the meeting with Chiefton Consultants.  What was thatissue?    Well, Mr Watson – Mr Agrizzi your affidavit at paragraph 22.10.4 says that Gavin Watson was seeing to the Minister.  Your evidence is that Gavin Watson was seeing the Minister, they are two very different things.  Whatwas the position?    Yes.    Yes.    Well perhaps we should do it this way, Chair.    If you are asked at any stage about the particular address of the two houses that you have talked about, you could provide it?    And you could identify the house personally from memory, because you visited those houses?    Alright, and your evidence is that you accompanied Mr Watson, Mr Gavin Watson on occasion when he and you then would see the Minister?    And in relation to your particular functions prior to the meeting you say that you were instructed to pack cash or what?   Alright, the real money, I presume.    And you say that you packed an amount of R50 000?    Over what period did you perform this function?    By long do you mean months, years?    Alright.   That is one of the houses, perhaps, and that was you say in the Krugersdorp area?    Did you visit the house in the Bryanston area?    Any particular feature, very briefly?   Let us then get back to your affidavit at paragraph 22.11. You were talking of a meeting that was held between yourselves and representatives of Chiefton Consultants.  Who in particular was present at that meeting?    Do you know what happened after that in relation to the contemplated appointment of Chiefton Consultants?    Right.  Did you discuss this issue with Gavin Watson after these events had unfolded?   Thank you, Chair.  The dates given in one of yourprevious answers to the, Chair, when he asked more or less the period relevant to the contents of paragraph 22.13, you mentioned 2005/2006.  Do you recall in relation to that when the SIU investigation commenced?  We will give that detailed evidence in due course, but just to place it in its proper context for the present?    Then there may be a lack of clarity around one of your answers to a question that I put.  In relation to the money paid to Ms Mokonyane, you say you raised an issue with Gavin Watson that you were not getting much return for that investment, as it were?    Well, we need to clarify then what you say in    Well, would you explain that please?    Alright.  Now when you say that Bosasa received no return for the money paid were you limiting your evidence to these particular circumstances in relation to money paid to Ms Mokonyane, or were you suggesting to the, Chair, that the bribes you paid had no outcome or benefit to Bosasa?    From what?    Mokonyane?    Yes, no what I am saying is that you put your answer to me in general terms.    You did not limit it specifically to money paid to Ms Mokonyane.    Now if someone reads your evidence they may seize upon the statement to say, but Mr Agrizzi himself said that they received no return for money paid.  Now are you referring in that sense to Ms Mokonyane′s circumstances or are you suggesting that Bosasa got little benefit for the bribes paid about which you have spoken in the last week?    Alright.    Your answer is now, I understand, are specifically related to the relationship between Bosasa on the one hand and Ms Mokonyane on the other?    I am not sure I made myself clear enough in relation to the line of questions that I am now putting to you, but let me put it another way.  You paid what you have described as bribes in relation for example to the Department of Correctional Services?    Did Bosasa receive benefits emanating from thosebribes in your opinion?    So the evidence you are giving concerning Ms Mokonyane should be limited to her?    Under the circumstances relating to the payments to her?    Thank you.  Then if we can go over the page, please, to page 40?  You deal there with the relationship between…[intervenes]    A moment, Chair, please?    I do not understand that answer.    Please explain, you are saying…[intervenes]    Well I am afraid Mr Agrizzi I am going to go back, because there must be clarity here.    The bribes you paid in relation to Department of Correctional Services, the Airports Company for South Africa and the other bribes…[intervenes]    That you have spoken about, did those produce results in the sense that they caused the award of contracts to you?    So nothing you are saying here about whether it was necessary to run a business like this detracts from that evidence that you have given, I understand?   Well I am not sure, I am sorry, Chair?    Thank you.  Let us wrap this up briefly Mr Agrizzi.  You say quite clearly and you confirmed that you meant to say I pointed out that a lot of money had been paid to Mokonyane with no return to Bosasa?    So you pay money to a government official and you get nothing in return.  You say she delivered squat?   You then go on to speak about running the business in another manner, do you see that?    May I suggest to you that the first part of paragraph 22.13 as you have confirmed not once, but on several occasions is correct?    You were frustrated that you were paying a lot of money to a government official without any return?    And by that you meant by not getting any contracts, without getting any financial benefit?    The second part of the paragraph where you conflate that issue with another issue as to how a business should be run, in general terms, is aseparate issue.    Well is it correct?  Because I want to suggest to you that the second part of the paragraph is there to make you look better?    Yes, well Mr Agrizzi let us conclude this debate about the science of bribery and Bosasa.  You made two points in 22.13?    So one is that you were paying money to Ms Mokoyane and you were not receiving any benefit?    The second is you questioned the policy of paying bribes in order to secure business?    And there was another way of doing business, which was a legitimate way?    After this discussion did you continue to arrange for payments to government officials for benefits?    Then let us go on then to page 40.    And you continued in your participation as before?    Then let us move on then to page 40 paragraph 23.1 please?  You now relate events relevant to a Mr Sesiniyi Seopela and his relationship with Bosasa, correct?    When were you introduced to Mr Seopela?    What was your knowledge of Mr Seopela′s history and qualifications?    Right.  In relation to Mr Seopela′s involvement with Bosasa or Bosasa related companies, do you recall what happened during or about November 2004?    And you say in your affidavit his travel expenses would be indirectly paid by him, because it was deducted from his income, which had been paid by Concillium?    And during 2011 did he receive a benefit at the instruction of Gavin Watson?    No deductions from his income?   Did, to your knowledge Mr Seopela give Mr Gavin Watson some information regarding developments at the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development?    And I am referring to paragraph 23.5 of your affidavit.  What information was given?    Alright, what did Mr Watson tell you?    Alright, a design and a program for what?  I am sorry, Chair?    At the time Mr Seopela was employed as a consultant and paid by Concillium Business Consultants Pty Ltd did he have any other form of employment?    And when was this information received by Gavin Watson or to put it differently when did Gavin Watson tell you about the information he had received from Seopela, more or less?    More or less?  The year?  Before 2010, after 2010?    Did Mr Seopela give you any information in relation to his connections?    And provide some detail please for the, Chair?    No, anyone else?  And I am referring to paragraph 23.6.    So I am not – my question is not limited to Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.    It is specifically in relation to what Mr Seopela told you about his connections in various arms of government to put it broadly.    Alright, we will come to the payments in due course.    But for the moment did he tell you anything about whether he was connected to officials in the National Prosecuting Authority or other law enforcement agencies?    What did he tell you?    Well you do not in your statement, so I am not inviting you to go further than your affidavit at this stage, perhaps later, but for the present did he tell you anything about high ranking officials in these institutions, in particular law enforcement agencies?    In broad terms yes, but no, Mr Agrizzi, I am asking specifically about whether Mr Seopela ever told you that he was connected in any sense with officials in the National Prosecuting Authority, the HAWKS and the erstwhile Scorpions?    He did tell you that?    And did you have any information from him that appeared to verify what you had been told by Mr Seopela?    Well, if you look at paragraph 23.6 of your affidavit, just take a moment to read it please?    Is what you say in that paragraph 23.6 correct?    So is it correct that as you say it always amazed me how Seopela would be able to verify information that we had received particularly in relation to the investigation into Bosasa?    Alright.  We will come to more detail in due course about Bosasa′s interest in the SIU investigation in particular.  In paragraph 23.7 and if youneed to just refresh your memory please do so, you expand on the relationship between Mr Seopela and Bosasa and in particular Gavin Watson and you record how payments were made, to which you have already referred.  Would you tell the, Chair, please of those circumstances?    Yes, thank you.    So, in relation to the payment of moneys, sorry I answered the question on your behalf, Chair, perhaps I should…[intervenes]    Thank you, Chair.    So the procedure you speak about in paragraph 23.7 is the following, Mr Seopela would request an amount of money from you?    Did he tell you what the purpose of that payment of money to him was?   What did he say?    So Mr Seopela came to you, he asked for money and he would describe in general terms the purpose for which money would be paid?    He would give you details of departments to which it would be paid or official, and he would give you details of contracts in respect of whichmoneys would be paid?    Alright, did you request details of individuals to whom money was intended to be paid?    And did he provide that information?    And did you raise that issue with Gavin Watson?    What had Gavin Watson respond?    Alright, again just to provide a little more detail there, Mr Agrizzi you have said to the, Chair, in evidence that there were many black books, is that correct?    And that you were responsible for recording information in those black books?    There were also lists kept on pieces of paper prior to theutilisation of black books?    But you have some lists and one black book in your possession, which you have given to the investigators?    Mr Agrizzi in paragraph 23.7.1 and following you relate in your affidavit what you do know about payments?    Let us just deal with 23.7.1 first, please and before mentioning any names I would like to understand the basis upon which the particular name mentioned there is referred to by you.  You say that a particular amount was paid to the Department of Correctional Services.  How much was that?    And that was during the period 2008 to 2016?    Alright, and you say initially R500 000 per month was paid, I presume to Mr Seopela if one reads this statement in proper context for onwardpayment to the Department of Correctional Services?    Was that now…[intervenes]    Is that what you mean when you referred to the payment in the first sentence of 23.7.1?   Alright, was that amount later amended?    And who was that, well before we go on, you are about to mention a name.  What was the relationship between the increase and the appointment of the Commissioner?  Well we all know that the Commissioner appointed that time was Mr Tom Moyane so we cannot ask you more about corroborative information.  You say it was increased to R750 000 per month when the new Commissioner was appointed?    That is the new Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services?    And that Commissioner was Mr Tom Moyane?   How did you learn that?    And did you believe this?    At this time was Bosasa receiving any benefits from theDepartment of Correctional Services?    Perhaps I should clarify.  Generally your evidence relates to the period 2008 to 2016?    But in particular in relation to the time when Mr Moyane was appointed as National Commissioner, you say that the amount was increased from R500 000 per month to R750 000 per month?    You do not say in particular to whom any of this money was given personally?    Yes, well, anybody can make those deductions including the, Chair, but let us just take it step by step.  At the time when Mr Moyane was appointed National Commissioner of Department of Correctional Services and therefore at the time the amount paid to officials or for the purpose of payment to officials within the Department of Correctional Services was Bosasa enjoying the benefits of contracts with the Department?    You, I understand, were tasked with preparing and handing over the money to Mr Seopela?    It was always in cash, I understand?    Is it possible that Mr Seopela simply pocketed this amount for his own purposes?   Why do you say that?    Then in paragraph 23.7.2 you…[intervenes]    When you say that Mr Seopela was a man of integrity I presume you mean that he could be relied upon to deliver money in accordance with the understanding with Gavin Watson and Bosasa?    The next paragraph 23.7.2 you may want to look at it, because there are number of allegations you make in it.    You refer to 2.5% of all payments received from the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development in respect of the 2013 tender awarded to Sondolo IT to establish secure systems in the various courts?    And you say that money was paid to Seopela for distribution to officials of that department.  First of all who or what was Sondolo IT PtyLtd?    And did it have a contract, sorry, was it a company associated with or within the group?    The Bosasa group?    And did it have a contract with the Department of Justiceand Constitutional Development?    Alright.  Approximately what amount was constituted by that 2.5%?    So you say that about R15-million was paid to the – well to officials of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development?    From your own knowledge are you able to say to which officials this money was paid?   From your own knowledge?    Who are those officials?  And I am not talking about what Mr Seopela told you.    That will come later.    So will you tell the, Chair, please, which officials received money and the basis upon which you are able to say from your ownknowledge that they indeed received money?    Yes.    Spell that please?    And how do you know that?    So…[intervenes]    And who was present when cash was handed over and who handed over the cash?   Now I am talking about these four individuals, three of whom you have named?    Yes, and who actually handed over the money?    But I thought Mr Seopela was responsible for handing over the money?   Alright, and these particular amounts handed over to the four people, three of whom you have named, were these big or small amounts?    Alright.  Did Mr Seopela tell you the names of persons to whom he handed money?  You have already told us that you relied on his information?    I remember one occasion only.    The others I can remember regular.    Chair, is this a convenient time?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Agrizzi you were telling us before the long adjournment of payments made to the officials of the department or to officials within the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.  Do you recall that?    Thank you Mr Agrizzi.  Before the long adjournment …[intervenes].    Thank you and just to place those recent comments of yours in proper context you were referring to paragraph 22.13 of your affidavit.   A section before the section where we are dealing with – before the long adjournment and which we will continue to deal with now.    Now we are dealing with Mr Seopela and monies that were given to him for onward payment for various purposes.    And you named certain officials of the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development to whom according to what you were told by Mr Seopela and from your own knowledge payments were made.   At the end of paragraph 23.7.2 you name the Secretary of the Commission Dr de Wee.    What were you told in relation to Dr de Wee?    Well just for completeness sake and we must obviously be thorough what were you told in relation to the secretary?    Alright and is that all you were told?   Alright.  So you do not know from your own knowledge indeed whether he was indeed a recipient – was complaining on his own behalf or was complaining on behalf of someone else?    Then in paragraph 23.7.3…    Paragraph 23.7.3 Mr Agrizzi contains information that you have related to the …[intervenes].    Thank you Chair.  Paragraph 23.7.3, you relate facts relating to the Department of Transport.  Now you are telling the Chair about payments made firstly and apparently for onward payment to officials in the Department of Correctional Services and then payments for apparently officials in the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and now you are talk of the Department of Transport.  How did it arise that payments were made for the Department of Transport and by that I presume you mean again officials in the Department of Transport?    The name of that company would you spell it again please?    Right and you talked of SMS Services.  Do you know what SMS stands for?    Or the SMS Fleet?    Yes.  Do you know what SMS stands for?    And …[intervenes].    And the SMS or Senior Management Services Fleet was a fleet of motor vehicles managed by Kgwerano?    How did you hand the money to Seopela, in what circumstances?    And did you always deliver the money to Mr Seopela?    Thank you Chair.  If you could go around please Mr Agrizzi to paragraph 24 of your affidavit under the heading Vincent Smith.  You are going to presumably tell the Chair about circumstances relating to the relationship between Bosasa on the one hand and Smith on the other.  Is that correct?    When did you meet Mr Smith?    For the first time.    Thank you Chair.  At the time do you recall what position Mr Vincent Smith held at Parliament?    Right and in paragraph 24.1 you relate the events regarding a meeting held during 2011.  Where was that meeting held?    Right.  Who was present at the meeting?    Was there anyone else from Bosasa present?    Right and he was present.    Right, what happened during this meeting?    Right.  Did Mr Vincent Smith say anything about a previous discussion with Gavin Watson?    What in summary what was, what was the topic of discussion at the meeting?    Right.    Thank you.  Was that all that was decided at thatmeeting?    Right.  Would they receive and by “they” I mean the parliamentarians present anything in return?    Where was that agreed?    Did that prior meeting refer to what you say in paragraph 24.2.1 to 24.2.3 that the three individual parliamentary members concerned would receive payments?   When did you learn that?    Right the meeting at which Gavin Watson was also present?    So that was discussed again then at that meeting?    Right.    Alright so let us leave aside a debate as to whether it was discussed or confirmed.  It was stated there that the three individuals would receive the amounts referred?    What are the amounts?    Okay right.  Do you know whether these payments were ever made?    How do you know that?    And how did you make the payments when you did so personally?    Right, can you recall an occasion where you handed money to Vincent Smith?    Any specific occasion, just one?    And did you also pack this money in the security bags towhich you have referred in evidence?    Right do you know why he three parliamentarians concerned and named by you received different amounts per month?    Alright.    You have told the Chair Mr Agrizzi that you made a payment personally on at least one occasion and many more but you described one occasion on which you made payment to Mr Smith?    You have also said that on occasion you made payment directly to Ms Ngwenya?    Do you recall any payment made by yourself to the third person involved Mr Nagagula?    Thank you.  It may seem a trivial point but regarding the payments to Mr Smith you say on occasion you would buy a newspaper?  When would you buy the newspaper in relation to the time of the delivery?    So that would presumably be a decision you would make before you met him?   How would you know to take the newspaper with you when you had not seen him and I understood you to say you would use a newspaper if he did not have a leather jacket or a folder?    Hope that is better cleared up now rather than later.   Did Mr Smith ever question the use of Mr Seopela as a go between for delivery of monies?    What did he say?    Can you recall more or less when Mr Seopela was excluded from the arrangements?  I am sorry Chair.    Did it transpire Mr Agrizzi that Messrs Magagula or Mr Magagula and Ms Ngwenya were no longer members of the standing committee on Correctional Services?    Was there a stage where Mr Magagula and Ms Ngwenyawere no longer members of the Correctional Services standing committee in parliament?    And what happened then in relation to their payments?    What happened in relation to the payments to Mr Vincent Smith during 2016?    And who made these payments according to your knowledge?   Were you present at any of these meetings where the amount of R100 000,00 was handed over to Vincent Smith?    Was Gavin Watson always available to hand the moneyover to Vincent Smith and I am talking about the R100 000,00 payments now?    And in that event what happened?    Right.  At that time were meetings held between Mr Gavin Watson and Mr Vincent Smith?    On a regular basis, on an infrequent basis, what was the position?    What was the purpose of those meetings?    Did Mr Smith tell you anything at a meeting obviously at what you were present in relation to what he was able to do in parliament?    Did Mr Smith say anything to you and Mr Watson at any of these meetings in regard to what he could do for Bosasa in parliament?    Alright.      Thank you Chair.  Mr Agrizzi was there an occasion where a crime incident occurred at Mr Smith’s house?    Briefly what happened and what was the consequence?    How was the payment for the equipment made?    I am not sure whether in your recent answers you have mentioned whose duty it was to see to the installation of these systems?    And by whom was Mr Le Roux employed at the time?    You say the equipment was paid for in cash?    Under the name of which company was it installed?    Well who installed it?    And for which company did they work?    In other words which company took responsibility for the installation?    And?    Well just look at paragraph 24.8.    The equipment that you have referred to?    In the name of which company?    Okay.  And Sondolo IT you have told the Chair is part of the Bosasa Group of Companies?    Okay.  Paragraph 24.9 you refer to another benefit.    Sorry before you go on you say I have – in relation to the security installations at the premises of Mr Smith you say in the last sentence of paragraph 24.8 “I have further documentary evidence in regard to the above which I am happy to provide to the commission.”  What documentary evidence do you have?   Then 24.9 refers to another benefit in relation to Mr Vincent Smith and his daughter.    Tell the Chair please of this benefit?    Of whom?    Right would you please turn to page 270 of the bundle S1.  Explain to the chair please what this documentation represents and you may also want to refer to page 272 and the following pages?    Yes.    The cover page is page 270.    Okay right let us take it a bit more slowly please.  At the bottom of the page.    There appears an email from Brumilda Smith to fees@aber.ac.uk and it apparent that it is an email addressed to Aberystwyth University.    And in that email it appears that Brumilda Doreen Smith says” to whomever it may concern I have decided it would be best for me to repeat my first year as a full time student would you be able to provide me with a fee requirement and payment structure for 2016/2017”.    And then apparently in reply to that Alison of theuniversity finance department addresses an email to Brumilda saying the fees for the next academic year are $10 500,00.    And then at the top of the page there is a further email where is appears that these two emails are forwarded to Vincent Smith?    Alright then if we go over the page to page 272 what is that document?    And it appears and it is highlighted on that page that the payment was made to an entity called Euro Blitz?    And it is represented as a cash deposit made on the 14 July 2015?    However on page 272 it appears that the transaction with the bank, FNB, the cash deposit for Euro Blitz in the amount set out therein took place on the 14 July 2015?   And the email chain on page 271 takes place during 16?    Can you explain that please because it would seem that the deposit was made before you knew what the fees were?    So well then just explain please the payment on page 272?   Well it cannot be for further payments because this is before the email chain on page 271?    Alright so you say that the information represented on page 272 is for a certain payment to Euro Blitz for university fees?    And the email chain is evidence relating to …[intervenes]    A later payment?    And that is on page 271?    Yes that is interesting because on page 271 there is a stamp with a date 2015?    And that is a stamp which appears to pre-date the very document being stamped?    Please explain.    Yes.    Is that a 6 there rather than a 5?    I understand Mr Agrizzi.    Yes well it seems very clear now that apart from the stamp of FNB on page 271 the fact that payments were made to Euro Blitz in separate amounts during separate years that what we do know is that the amount of R276 667,90 is not the amount of $10 500,00 referred to on page 271, it could not be?    Whether the slip has deteriorated or not …[intervenes].    It is not the same and then if you – well perhaps I should give you a chance before leaping in with questions Mr Agrizzi.  You explain to the Chair please the documents at page 271, 272 and following, if those are relevant.   So the documents at page 273 and following appear to show that the company EuroBlitz and Mr Vincent Smith are indeed related.    Okay.  So you say in paragraph 24.10   “The payment for Vincent Smith’s daughter, daughters following their study was paid to EuroBlitz.”    Alright.  It may have been a fault of others apart from yourself, but 24.9 then needs to be corrected, because …[intervenes].    The proof of payment is in relation not to page 270, but in relation to a prior payment for fees.    Yes, I do not want to get involved in semantics with you    Yes, we will …[intervenes].    We will look at that Chair.    The issue of course is that both the email chain relating to 2016 and the proof of payment relating to 2015 the prior payment are both Annexure H which is …[intervenes].    Confusion.    But the evidence at least is clear.    We will do Chair.  I am just rereading 24.9.  It may well be necessary.  I am sorry Chair.  It may well be unnecessary to amend it.    Even that Annexure H refers to both years of payment.    Thank you.  If we can get then onto paragraph 24.11 Mr Agrizzi.  You refer there to Mr Smith and the matters relating to Mr Smith being raised in Parliament in the context of an alleged loan.  Would you tell the Chair please about those incidents?    How did the matter arise in Parliament?  What was the context of Mr Smith’s claim?    Can you recall more or less when the matter was raised in Parliament?    Also in 2017/2018?    And in relation to the matter being raised in Parliamentwhen before or after did he request a loan from you?    So he asked you for a loan.  You refused.  He offered to sell you his shareholding.  You refused.  After that the matter was raised in Parliament and Mr Smith claimed you had arranged a loan to him.    Is that the sequence?    Then if we may continue then with paragraph 25 you deal with matters related in this paragraph to the Department of Correctional Services.    When did you meet Mr Patrick Gillingham for the first time?    The date in paragraph 25.1 is that correct or not?    Not 2013?    Sure.    So you met Patrick Gillingham at Lindela in 2003?    Before that were you aware of any involvement that he had with Bosasa or Gavin Watson?   Rare occasion or rare beef?    Sorry, unnecessary Mr Chair.  Did you know what position Mr Gillingham held at the time?    Yes.    He was wearing uniform, but you do not know what uniform, what department that uniform …[intervenes].    So it is apparent that at the time he was employed at the Department of Correctional Services?    Right and you have already spoken about the arrangement or contract with the supply of beef to – is it Correctional Servicesestablishments?    Prisons in short.    Who was handling that contract for Bosasa?    Yes.    And has that or was that contract subsequently taken over by another person?    Both.    Right.  Who introduced you to Mr Gillingham?    And at the time of the introduction did Mr Watson say anything about his or Bosasa’s relationship and further contemplated relationship?    With him …[intervenes].    With Mr Gillingham.    Did Mr Gavin Watson at that time or shortly thereafter tell you anything about his intentions regarding existing catering contracts at the mines?    And specifically when you refer to new ventures what are you referring to?    Right.  Only security contracts?    Ah.    And do you know why Mr Watson wanted to extract Bosasa from mining contracts?    Right.  Do you recall the first contact that Bosasa wasawarded or one of the first contracts of which you became aware in 2004?  A contract awarded by the Department of Correctional Services.  You deal with that in paragraph 25.6.    The reference to 111, I am not following.        In paragraph 25.7 you refer to the future involvement of Mr Taverner of which you at that stage had not become aware or were not aware.   Tell the Chair about that please.    We will come to that detail in due course.    In paragraph 25.8 you talk of your second meeting…[intervenes].    With Mr Gillingham.    Please tell the Chair about that meeting.    Right.  It may be pre-empting the evidence to follow, but during the course of that visit which you relate in your statement, did you gain knowledge of the catering needs and concerns of the Department of Correctional Services?  In short did you gain knowledge of the business of catering at the Correctional Services institutions?    Who went on this tour?   Before you go on, Frans Vorster’s experience and skills?    That would be the linguistics of catering food and the like?    And Mr Viljoen?    Mr Mansell?    Right, which was involved or which had been involved in catering?   You visited what establishments?    And approximately how many prisons did you visit?    And on these tours did you communicate with others within the establishments?    The purpose of the tour was to compile or to produce a report you say?    So you also dealt with costings?   A general question it will become clearer later, but would this information be useful to anyone wishing to tender resultant bid?    Who paid for the expenses relating to this tour?    And extra hotel expenses for Bosasa employees?   Right.  You then would have concluded the tour.  What happened then in relation to this report?    And having been on this tour did you develop an idea for further a possible involvement at the Department of Correctional Services of commercial value to Bosasa?    So what did you do in that regard?    Was the report then submitted as you say toGavin Watson and then returned to?    There.    Was is the other one?    Yes and tell the Chair please did you learn the final destination of what was sent to these email addresses?  In other words who owned the, perhaps not who owned, but who the addressee was in person.    So you were then instructed by Mr Gavin Watson to send the finalised report to Mansell and to Gillingham?    Alright.  At the time what did you believe the role of Bosasa was in relation to what you have just told the Chair?    Right.  You were not told this at any stage?    Not even when you were preparing the report?    Did this; sorry, I interrupted you.  Do you want to complete?    But as I understand your evidence in paragraph 25.17 and you have just told the Chair this the information in that report prepared by youbecame or was transferred into the specification documents used as part of the invitation to bid for the Correctional Services Catering Tender.    Right.  When did you learn of that fact?    So you prepared the report – you were taken on a tour of Correctional Services.    Managed by a Correctional Services official.   Mr Gillingham.  You received information both in relation to the physical facilities and costings as well as other logistical information?    You compiled a report?    That report found its way into the tender documents and in particular into the specifications in those documents?     And then you were instructed to respond to the invitation to tender?    An invitation to bid rather?    And I presume you are aware that that is quite improper?   When was the bid advertised?    Alright did you make any comment in regard to what you have just told the Chair to Mr Watson?    And what was Mr Watson’s response to what you told him?    Is that what he told you?    Just be a bit clearer please.  What did he tell you about the award of the contract?    Okay who compiled the response to the invitation to bid?    And they did that under your supervision?    And was the contract ultimately awarded to Bosasa?    Is this the same contract that was later investigated in detail by the SIU?    Alright we will come back there when we deal with that report.  And for what period of time was the contract awarded?    Alright and do you know what the annual value of the contract was?    Alright.  Right.  The date in paragraph 25.2.1 in the second line reads 20 July 2014.  That is obviously not correct.  What is the correct date?    Do you have any comment to make about the costings in the bid documents prepared under your supervision?    So in short Mr Agrizzi you told the department in your bid that the services would cost R239 odd million per annum?    But in fact you knew that you would in reality chargethem much more when the contract was executed?    And then what happened on 29 September 2004?    Alright who – just give his full names please, Mti’s full names?    Who was – what position did he occupy at the time?    What was the value of this expansion?    Was that expansion authorised by the original tender documents?  In other words could the expansion properly be awarded in terms of a contract without going through a new tender process?    And did it in fact go out to tender?    So without authorisation in terms of the original tender and without authorisation in terms of a new tender an extension was granted to extend the catering contract to other correctional centres and the value of that to Bosasa was R14 million per month?    And were you rewarded for all the work that you had done here?    Can you say whether your increase was a reward for the work you had done in relation to the Correctional Services contract?    In any event in the …[intervenes].    So in summary Mr Agrizzi in relation to the catering services contract awarded to Bosasa by the Department of Correctional Service and in or around R2004 you were personally involved in the events preceding the issue of the tender documents?    You compiled the tender documents or the response to the bid for tender more particularly.    Well you compiled the report which became specifications?    You also were instrumental in the sense that you led the team that compiled the response to the invitation to bid?    And you were there also aware of and involved in the under-costing which resulted later in a higher payment to Bosasa?    Yes but this was all done under your supervision?    And then you knew of the improper or even unlawful extension to the further seven satellite correctional centres?    Was that the same painting of the house referred to in the schedule at the beginning of your statement?    And the amount is there, is it?    Well you need not go there, it is there, it is not going to change.    Was there a meeting held at Supersport Park after the catering tender had been awarded to Bosasa?    More or less when was that meeting held?    And what was the purpose of the meeting or what happened at the meeting?    Right you obviously attended the meeting.  Did anyone else from Bosasa attend the meeting?    Approximately how many people in total attended the meeting?    Alright and did Mr Mti – Commissioner Mti at the time participate in the proceedings?    Right did you receive any feedback the following day in relation to the meeting from Gavin Watson?   Right in the pipeline?    For Bosasa I presume?    And in relation to that did you receive an instruction?    So once again you learn of a contract that is be awarded in the future?    By the Department of Correctional Services?    This is shortly after the presentation meeting that you refer to?    Before I presume any tender documents are issued or any publication of the intention to issue a tender is advertised you are instructed to draft a specification document?    So am I correct perhaps I have been leading a little excessively – it is late in the day my apologies Chair but is it correct that when youwere instructed to draft the specification document there had been no public announcement of the intention to award a tender for access control at Correctional Services Institution?    Were you given any further instruction in relation to the manner in which you should produce this draft or what the draft specifications document should include?    Alright you refer to ISO standards we do not necessarily know about those things.  Just explain perhaps…[intervenes].    At whose for instance.    And of course you have already told the Chair that Bosasa had through one its company’s involvement in the Lindela Repatriation Centre which was a care environment?    Did you receive any further information from the Department of Correctional Services in the process of drafting the specifications?    Right did you do as you were told?    Did you produce the specifications ...(indistinct).    And to whom did you give it?    No before it was mailed?    Did you show it to anyone?    And did he approve it?    Alright so this document was sent to the same two email addresses as you referred to in paragraph 25.16?    And you told the Chair that these were the email addresses of Gillingham and Mansell respectively although you could not remember which was which?    We will find that out later in the evidence.    After …[intervenes].    Subsequent to your preparation of the specifications document was an invitation to bid advertised by the Department of Correctional Services?    You prepare the specifications document?    You send it to Mr Mansell and Mr Patrick Gillingham?    Mr Gillingham is employed at that stage by the Department of Correctional Services?    Then as I understand your evidence the Department of Correctional Services actually issue an invitation to bid in relation to those veryspecifications which you have drafted?    Do you recall when the invitation to bid was advertised?    Right did you then receive an instruction from Gavin Watson in relation to that invitation to bid?    Did you carry out that instruction?    And before the document was submitted did..   Alright so the initial instruction was to respond to the invitation to bid under the name of Bosasa Security PTY LTD?    Gavin Watson then intervened before the tender documents were submitted and said we must establish a new company?    And the new company established at that stage was Sondolo IT PTY LTD?    This required amendments presumably to the bid documents, correct?   And were these effected, it should read effected with an e not an a but they were effected and the application was submitted?    Alright.  What happened in regard to the award of the contract?    Sondolo IT PTY LTD?    And for what period was the contract awarded?    In what respect was it expanded?    At how many sites?    Right and what was the value of that expansion?    Alright is that the figure referred to in paragraph 26.9?    In relation to the expansion to include the staffing of thecontrol rooms at 66 sites you will recall right in the beginning of your evidence we told the Chair that there was some expansions that were authorised by the original tender documents and some were not and therefore would have to go out to new tender?    What was the case here?  Was this expansion authorised?    Right.    So you would have responded to an invitation to bid at a certain price which was apparently budgeted for?    By the Department of Correctional Services?    But then later as you knew would happen the requirement for further expenditure on the part of the department entered the scene and you benefitted then from the extension of the staffing or the extension of the contract in relation to staffing?    Right and the value of that was over R236 million per annum?    Or overall for the two years?    Right.  After the award of that contract were you called into a meeting?    What happened at that meeting?    You mentioned the name Ishmael Dekhane and the name Mncwaba, the latter name was that his name at the time – surname at the time?    That is M-n-c-w-a-b-a, is that correct?    In short are you telling the Chair that you were awarded for all the good you had done for Bosasa in relation to the evidence you have just given?    Is that a convenient time Chair?    We have an hour to make up.    Yes that is absolutely fine.
