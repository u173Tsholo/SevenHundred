CHAIRPERSON:Good morning Ms September, good morning everybody    I am sorry we could not start at eight o’clock but we will try and cover up.  Okay are you ready?    Okay.  Let us proceed.    The lever arch file containing the statement of Mr Arson Malola-Phiri will be marked Exhibit DD6.    Yes.    Have been provided to or by South African Express?    To South African Express?    Okay.    Hm.    Ja.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Thank you.    You may proceed.    It does not look like I need to have a look at it.  You …   You have said that relevant parties are aware and they are not bringing any application to protect any confidentiality and in regard to certain documents that you felt may have issues of confidentiality you have taken measures to take care of that.    Ja.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja that would…    Yes no that is fine.    That is fine.  Just feel free to tell us if you do not hear.    Thank you.      62?    Yes.    Okay.    Paragraph 67 is at page 18.   For Mafikeng airport?    So it – both should not be there and instead of both there should be Mafikeng and it should be airport not airports.    With capital letter A, is that correct?  Can you hear me?    Oh okay.      Paragraph 67 should the last two words be replaced by Mafikeng Airport?    Mafiking.    Yes.  Oh okay.    Mafiking.  Okay it has been defined okay.   Okay thank you.    What page is that?    Hm.  Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    The four – so the further ticking should be in regard to 2 and it should be the last column and then the next ticking should be where?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh okay.    Yes okay thank you.    Before that you remember supply a supplementary affidavit taking care of these corrections.    Ja.    I am sorry the – the Masters you say Masters in F…    Ja.  In Finance?    Oh thank you.    Thank you.   Ys.    Thank you.    This – I am sorry this was which year?  Which year was this?    2016?    2016 in May?    Okay.    Yes, ja I was about to say let us the group you know    Those were board members for SA Technical?    Oh for the SAA Group.    Okay.    Yes.    So what the third board member at SA Technical?  Were there three board members at SA Technical?    Three at a group?    Yes, yes.    Oh so SA Technical had only two members?    Oh but the whole board;.    Of SA Technical consisted of how many people?    Oh.  So SA Technical had four board members   Two being the CEO or the acting CEO during yhour time.    And the CFO those were executive board members.   And then there were two non-executive board members but those two non-executive board members were also board members at Group level and that was Mr Dudu Meyene and Yakhe Kwenana?    Yes.    So part of the point you make about issues of governance is that whereas the requirement of proper good governancewas that two or the majority of the board members at SA Technical level – Technical should be non-executive while it was true that they were non-executive at SA Technical but they were members of the board at group level and therefore issues of independence arose.    Is that part of the point you were making?    Yes okay thank ou.    Oh SA Group.    Oh okay.    Okay.    Yes.    And that is charged in disciplinary sense not in a criminal sense    He was charged with disciplinary – it was disciplinary charges what you are talking about?    Not – not criminal charges?   Ja.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    I – I understand you to want to limit your – your evidence in regard to the issues of procurement and ethics and so on atthat time to saying certain things were happening which made you believe that ethics was – was being eroded and that there were challenges with regard to procurement - following procurement processes - but you want to leave it at that.  Is that right?    Yes, okay.    Okay.    Who was the Chairlady who you are talking about now?    Who was the Chairlady who you are talking about?  I think you said the Chairlady resigned.  Is that right?    Oh she was the Chairlady?    Oh, oh okay alright.    Yes.  Earlier on Ms September asked you specific instances of challenges with procurement …    And – and I understood you to – to say you wanted to leave it at simply saying it was your feeling or perception that they were issues in regard to procurement challenges and ethics.  I just want to say that it is not because we are not interested in instances of challenges and procurement and so on but it is simply because I haveread your statement. I know that it does not cover those issues and certainly subsequent to this if the legal team talks to you and it appears that you do have knowledge of instances relating to procurement that may be important for Commission then they can take a statement that coversthose issues. I just – I do not want anybody to think we are not interested in issues of procurement that you might know about.    Okay.    The involvement that ended would be involvement inwhat?    Huh-uh.    Hm.    So does it mean that after the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement you had no particular interactions with Dube TradePort?    You did not or you did?  You had no involvement whatsoever or you still had some other involvement with them?    Okay.    Yes.   Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Had been put in place.    Okay.   Okay.  I think that is what I was looking for.  Whether in regard to execution you had no involvement.  That is fine.    Thank you.    I am sorry.  Are you looking at the signatures at page 35?    Yes.  Excuse me.  Is SAX – does SAX stand for South African Express?   Does SAX stand for South African Express?    Oh.    So that is your signature there?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    Did you say 36?    Thank you.       Well let me just get the last point that you were making.  You were saying that S A Express would incur certain costs and claim those costs from Dube Tradeport and those costs would be covered under the Preliminary Activities Fund is that correct?       Alright.     Okay.         I didn’t say when we would take the tea break since we started earlier than normal, we’ll take it at half past nine just in case there may be people attending who might not be aware we are not going to sit the whole day today, we’ll adjourn at 11 and then tomorrow we will not start at normal time we hope to start around 12 o’clock so just so that people can plan their lives appropriately, yes thank you.       Okay, alright I suspect that at certain stages your voice goes down, it may be that some of the people at the back might not hear you when it goes down, try and maintain it at the higher level, okay thank you.      Yes let’s take the tea break and we’ll resume at quarter to ten, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNEDINQUIRY RESUMES    Yes let us proceed.    Your sentence is not complete.  Your question is notcomplete.      You started it and then…    I think you changed your mind about what to saymidway so…    Just ask the question again it is not complete.    Would it be correct to simply say that ground handling really that business – that part of the business relates to everything that needs to be done on the ground before and up to the time when the passenger and his or her luggage get onto the aircraft and after the passenger leaves the aircraft up to when she leaves the airportbuilding.  That is what all the activities connected with the travelling of a passenger who is flying or who has been flying.  All that happens to enable her or him to fly that happens on the ground up to the time when he or she gets onto the plan and his or her luggage gets onto the plane and when he or she has landed on the other and her leaving theaircraft, going to the airport building, being able to collect his or her luggage that is all ground handling.    Yes the second bit is when you leave the aircraft at your destination you leave the aircraft from that point and your luggage being taken out of the aircraft up to the time you get out of the airport building.  Whatever activities need to be done to enable you to leave the airport building that is part of aircraft – ground handling?    Ja.  Hm.  Yes ja, ja.     So under witnesses the first signature is that of Mr Van Wyk and the second one is that of Ms Thandi Kunene, is that what you are saying?   Okay I must raise my voice.    I forgot.    The first witness in relation to the signature or signatory of SA Express.    Is that the signature for Mr Van Wyk?  The first signature as a witness?    Yes.  And the second witness’ signature you say is that of Ms Thandi Kunene?    Okay.  And the signatory the one who signed for SA Express you say that signature is that of Mr Ntshanga?    Okay thank you.    I am sorry.  Before that you recognise any of the signatures who witnessed – who signed as witnesses against Mr VanWyk’s signature?    Yes.    Yes the second one okay thank you.    Hm.   So – so you say that this R3.8 million I am just rounding if off you still need to add another R1 million to it and that would be the costs.  So they have not taken into account another amount of about R1 million?   Yes.    Yes okay.    I am sorry would that be a contribution or would thatbe all the operational costs that would be claimable from that amount of R5 million?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Falls within the budget for that.  Yes.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    What page?    Okay.    That is the first signature on the page?  Is that the first signature on the page?    Is – is the signature that you say belongs to Mr Ntshanga the first one …    On this page?    Ja.  I just want to …    I just want you to identify …    Which one is whose signature and which one is whose signature.    Okay.   I am sorry.  Both signatures are not …?    Oh, okay.  Okay, thank you.    Thank you.    At what page?    Ja, it is much better.    I am sorry.  Just one second.  Thank you.    You did say earlier on in your evidence that when an airline starts a new route or starts on a route that it has not been – or starts a new route I think you said.  That the first two years it would not make profit.  You did not say that?   Ja.  No, no I - I do not necessarily want that information.  I just want to check whether I had – I might have misunderstand your evidence.  I thought earlier on – much earlier – thought you had said that if an airline starts a new route …   The first two or so years it should not expect profits.  So I am just checking whether that is not what you said earlier.    Hm.    Oh, okay.    Okay.    Ja, okay.   General ja.    How many – how many thousands?    Okay, per trip?    Yes.   Million?    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Thank you.    I think he said three times a week.    A return trip?   A return trip, three times a week you said or not?  A return trip three times a week or …?    Ja.   Ja.    Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    And those costs that you are talking about in general you are talking about what it would cost today as opposed to that time? What are you having in mind?  Are you having in mind some time back or at the moment?    Okay.   Okay.    Ja.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Why is there such a big difference between 2015 and 16 on the one hand and 2017 and 2018 on the other hand?        Sorry?        Oh okay why is there such a big difference on 2015 – what was spent in 2015 and 2016 on the one hand on what was spent in 2017 and 2018?       But can you see what I see?       I mean 2015 and 2016 are one comma something and – well 2015 is almost two million because 1.9million, 2016 is 1.03million but then 2017 is 7.4million and 2018 is 7.9million it’s difficult to think it could be inflation related.       Yes, yes.       Ja well – and then 2018/2019 there is that 534 there that’s because it’s incomplete it doesn’t reach a million rand yet because that’s an incomplete year or what?       2018/2019 you have got R534 000, is that right? MR ARSON       And that’s because that’s not final, that’s not the final figure.      Okay, no that’s fine thank you.      Yes thank you.       Thank you.      Thank you.        No I’m laughing about three eyes.     Thank you very much.         Yes, yes, thank you.  Thank you very much Mr Phiri, if you are required to come back we’ll ask you and if anybody applies for leave to cross-examine you and that application is granted we will ask you to come back but – unless you have a question that you didn’t think about earlier, I’m about to release him.       Thank you very much Mr Phiri you are excused, thank you very much.      Ja where is Mr Phatudi – oh Ms Phatudi.        Please be back here tomorrow we are going to aim to start at 12 tomorrow there might be a little bit of some delay because some things will be beyond our control, but be here by 12 o’clock.  We are going to adjourn then for today and tomorrow we’ll aim to start at 12, there might be some delay and if need be we may go on until earlyevening if we have to in order to make up for the hours that we won’t be able to use tomorrow morning.  We adjourn. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Good morning Chair.    Yes I am Chair.    Chair the bundle before you is marked DD6.     Thank you Chair.  That is certainly the file to be used for the evidence today.  This particular witness Chair is currently an employee of South African Express.  He is currently on a fixed term one year contract and before this he was previously employed during the years of 2007 to 2012. Chair just to orientate the location of this evidence it deals particularly with the focus area as explained at the very outset of the stream to deal with the transactions that occurred in the North West in particular the North West Departmentof Transport and South African Express in respect of the Pilanesberg and the Mafikeng airports.  Chair you will recall that Mr Ngwenya of yesterday gave a background in relation to these particular transactions.  This witness however deals with more of a comparative analysis between suites of agreements such being that which has beenconcluded between South African Express and Dube Trade Port and to compare that with the transactions that were concluded in the North West.  In so doing Chair it raises really the question to this commission and that is were the North West contracts reasonable in its terms or did it actually perhaps form a basis for fraudulent or corrupt activities and that is a question that this commission then would need to consider against the background of the information and evidence to be presented today.  Chair there is one preliminary issue and due to the nature of it it is important that we place certain things on record with your leave of course.   It relates – it relates particularly to confidentialities of the documents to be used by this witness during his witness today.  Chair in that regard I would like to place on record that all of the documents that this particular witness attaches to his affidavit in this bundle DD6 has in fact been provided to South African Express.  They took issue with 13…    No the commission provided a copy of all of the annexures…   Correct.    To his statement but not necessarily his statement his affidavit itself just the annexures.   It was done in a series of witnesses Mr Phiri being one of them.  South African Express took issue in particular with 13 of the 16 annexures.  Of the 13 I am informed by our investigators that 4 annexures are already in the public domain.  7 of the annexures constitute agreements that have been concluded with third parties and through the assistance of the secretariat the counter contracting parties to those agreements were contacted yesterday and Dube Trade Port in particular took no issue who raises no objection to those – to the use of the documents and so does Menzies and anagreement was reached with South African Airways and their attorneys in particular on redactions which have since been effected.  There were two particular annexures Chair that does not constitute agreements itself but it is more cost data and it is cost data that is relevant to South African Express.  Whilst South African Express despite several invitations to bring an application to protect any confidentialities that they may wish to have protected.  We are informed that South African Express has no intention to bring such application however it is the considered view of the legal team to not in this particular case deal with the data that is contained and particularly the cost data that iscontained in those two annexures.  It is specific to this matter and it is specific to the circumstances of this matter.  And accordingly redactions have then also been affected.  In alignment with those redactions certain costings that is contained in the affidavit itself have similarly been redacted.  Chair in that regard with your leave unlessthere is any questions can the oath then be administered to the witness?    Chair just for…    Thank you Chair.  Just for the recordwe have created a small correspondence bundle in relation to the confidentiality issues.  With your permission should you so wish we could hand that up?    As it pleases.    No problem Chair.    Mr Phiri if I then may take you to page 1 of the bundle before you.  Do you recognise this document?    What is it?    Thank you.  Can I ask you to turn to page 21 please?  Whose signature appears above the word deponent?    So this affidavit was accordingly signed with all annexures on the 5 June 2019 before a commissioner of oaths, is that correct?    Okay thank you.  If I can then askyou to please provide details of your academic qualifications to the Chair?    Okay.  Maybe before we start with your academic qualifications can I quickly take you to page 17, 17?      And in particular paragraph 62.  Is it…   Yes.  Is it correct that the year of 05 ought to have been 2015?    Okay.    If I could then also quickly take you to page 67.    Yes.  Sorry, sorry, sorry page 18.  Humble apologies it is the next page.    Yes.  Sorry I said page – paragraph 67.  Is it also correct that there was – there is a correct that instead of at that sentence to ‘for both airports’ it ought to read ‘for Mafikeng”?    And then lastly can I just take to…    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.   And then lastly if I can quickly take you to page 16, 16 and there is the table that appears on that page.    16.    Is there any corrections that you wish to make to this table?   And so apart from those changes you stand by the remaining aspects of your affidavit?    In that case then can I ask youplease just provide detail of your academic qualifications?    Okay will do Chair.    Mr Phiri can you please proceed to provide your academic qualifications to the Chair?    Thank you.  From paragraph 3 on page 1 of your affidavit you talk about your employment history at SA Express in particular.    Thank you Chair.  From paragraph 3you talk about your employment at SA Express in particular.  Can I ask you though to just give detail of your employment history to the extent that it extends beyond your employment in SA Express to get a better feel and understanding of how long you have worked within the aviation industry?    If we can just…    Before you leave – before you leave Mr Phiri – is it correct that as a consequence of the roles that you had in SA Express at that time you were also a member of the Executive Committee?    Thank you.  Please proceed?    Before you leave SAA Technical can we just talk a little bit about the roles that you had at SAA Technical?  What was the role that you held when you joined SAA Technical in Sep – 2012 – you said September 2012 if I heard correctly?   But before you take that break Mr Phiri who was the chairperson at SAA at that time?   Okay and now you talk about your resignation.  What actually happened during May of 2016 during your stay at SAA Technical?    And why did you tender your first resignation as you put it?    When you talk about …    When you talk about turbulent times within the organisation on corporate governance issues which organisation do you speak about?  Because at the time you were in South African – SAA Technical notwithstanding that the fact you also had a seat at Group ExCo level.    And who if I could who were those board – who were the board members at the time?   But maybe just to amplify on yourpoint Chair.  You talk specifically about the turbulence of corporate governance within the organisation in order for us to appreciate what turbulence you refer to can you give us examples of corporate governance issues that caused you to consider leaving the organisatioin?   And who was that?    Who was that at the time?    No problem.    And on that point Mr Phiri was there any interference in the procurement at SA Technical?    Mr Phiri so when did you resign from SA Technical?   As it pleases Chair.  So you left the organisation in or rather SA Technical in September 2016.  Is that correct?    And that at that particular time youtook the decision to retire.  You then ventured out of the aviation industry but you returned to the aviation industry on 21 November 2018.  Is that correct?    Where – can you just clarify in fact – sorry?Is it correct then that you joined SA Express on 21 November 2018?    Is that August September 2018?    Thank you.    Thank you Mr Phiri.  So according to my calculations you have experience of approximately 15 years within the aviation industry.  Is my calculation correct?    Would it be fair to say that you are in fact well versed in contracting arrangements within the aviation industry based on your experience within the industry?    So if you can then turn to page 2 ofyour statement and paragraph 6 talks specifically to the focus of your evidence today which we will – we will now focus on.  You have been request by the Commission to do a comparative analysis between suites of agreements and as outlined in – on page 2 paragraph 6 please just describe the core point of focus for your evidence today.    Okay.  So on the one hand youlooked at contract – contractual suites of agreements relating transactions between SA Express and Dube TradePort.  Is that right?    And then as compared to that you have also looked at another suite of agreements which has been provided to you by the investigators of this Commission.  We talk specifically to the transactions between the North West Department of Transport and SA Express.  Is that right?    The common denominator or at leastthe primary common denominators of these two suites of agreements is that SA Express is a common contracting party.  Is that right?    And that both these suites of agreements relates to the development of new routes?   In particular the Dube TradePort Suite of Agreements - if we could that – talks to the development of routes between Kinshasa – King Shaka International Airport Durban and Lusaka on the one hand and Harare on the other?    Whereas the North West Suite of Agreements talks to the development of new routes in relation to the Pilanesberg and the Mafikeng Airports relative to other airports?    Thank you.  Were you personally involved in the – or rather let me first ask you how did Sout African Express become involved in the Dube TradePort Project?    And so if I may then following onfrom your evidence another very critical common denominator between the agreements in the Dube TradePort Precinct and the – and the agreements in the North West Precinct is that both suites or agreements concerned some form of compensation or incentivisation payable to South African Express.  Is that right?   Okay.  Who owns the King Shaka International Airport?    So notwithstanding that the contracts we are now going to interrogate was concluded with Dube TradePort was ACSA involved in these negotiations at all?    Were you involved in the negotiationswith Dube TradePort?    And is – so your involvement ended after the Memorandum of Agreement that was concluded between Dube TradePort and South African Express?    Your involvement …    Ended after the Memorandum of Agreement was concluded?    Okay.  Now in order …    And the reason for you then not being involved any longer to follow on from your evidence earlier is that at the time that or shortly after the MOA was in fact signed you left SA Express during 2012.  Is that right?    Okay.  So in order to do what I could possibly call an apple with apple comparative analysis let us just consolidate what exactly the type of agreements were that constitutedwhat we call the Dube TradePort Agreements as compared to the North West Agreements. Is it right that the Dube TradePort Agreements consists of a series of agreements?  Such being the Memorandum of Understanding, the Memorandum of Agreement and certain addenda.    And parking that to one side.  If one were to then consider the agreements concluded in the North West you would look at the – or rather you have considered the main agreement that was concluded between the North West Department of Transportand South African Express together with four ground handling contracts.  Is that correct?    So to do the comparative analysis can I ask you first to turn to page 23 please? Is this the Memorandum of Understanding that was part of the evidence you have just given?  And this Memorandum of Understanding was concluded between Dube TradePort and South African Express Airways?    Can I ask you then to turn to page 26?   Oops – sorry, sorry – to 35.  Humble apologies.  Is it correct that this agreement was signed on the – during September 2011?    Whose signature appears on behalf of South African Express?    Thank you and now to just look at some of the key provisions.   Page 35 Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Paragraph 1.1.2 on page 25 defines SAX to mean the SA Express.  I ought to have takenyou there Chair – sorry.  If we can then turn to page 26 and paragraph 3 specifically talks to the duration of the agreement and 3.1.1 informs    And it is therefore correct that there was in fact a subsequent agreement that was signed which was theMemorandum of Agreement that you were also involved in?    If I can then ask you to turn to page 25 paragraph 2.3 sets out the scope of this agreement and in particular       36 Chair.     Mr Phiri the routes that are identified at page 36 which two routes did S A Express show a particular interest in?       Thank you.  And then in line with your evidence of earlier which spoke about incentivisation offerings can I ask you to turn to page 30 please. Paragraph 11 talks particularly to the Preliminary Activities Fund, 11.1 speaks specifically to the fact that Dube Tradeport will advance an amount of 5million rand to be utilise for the Planning Development Marketing and Operations of the joint activities contemplated by the memorandum of understanding to be split between passenger and cargo activities.  Can you just explain it a little bit more detail exactly what this Preliminary Development Fund was and how was it contemplated at the time to operate?      Before we talk about the incurring and claiming methodologies which is neatly captured in the memorandum of agreement can we perhaps then go there, just to setthe context for what you’re about to inform?       Can I then ask you to please turn to page 38 of the bundle, 38.  Is that the memorandum of agreement concluded between Dube Tradeport and South African Express Airways following the memorandum of understanding?       Can I ask you to please turn to page 52 of the bundle. Noting from this page that this agreement was signed during May of 2012 whose signature appears on this page on behalf of South African Express?      Thank you.  On page 43 of the agreement, or sorry 43 of the bundle mention is made that this agreement is concluded for 12 months at paragraph 4 and in particular to the information that you were sharing with the Chair on theentitlement to claim and claim methodology I’d like us to look at paragraph – clause 5.  So clause 5 talks specifically to the regional route development and can I ask you to read into the record clause 5.2 please.      And if I could then ask you to turn to page 44 in continuance of clause 5.3 paragraph 5.3 (b) 1, 2 and 3 outlines very clear defined amounts that are claimable in respect of particular types of aircraft, is that correct?        Then could I ask you to read paragraph 5.4 into the record please.       Then in summary the methodology of how this agreement applied to the incentivisation of the scheme based on the paragraphs that you read includes that S A Express is entitled to claim a specific amount which is calculated per aircraft, thatamount is regulated by tariffs which applies to both ACSA, for the record being Airports Company of South Africa and ATNS being Air Traffic Navigation Services.       In addition the claim methodology is that S A Express pays and then claims back based on a checks and balances process.       Thank you.  Now Mr Phiri while some of these terms are quite familiar to you can I ask that we unpacksome of these terms a bit so that – it’s going to be used further in your evidence as well.  Paragraph 5.2 on page 43 talks about a whole range of charges and costs and the like.  You mentioned also earlier about operating costs, can you please explain what exactly operating costs would include for an airline on a route?      Thank you, if I could then ask you to…(intervention).       Thank you Chair.  Pursuant to the memorandum of agreement it was mentioned in there that certain –more substantive agreements need to be concluded in respect of each route and those were in fact concluded, is that right?       Can I ask you to turn to page 55 please of the bundle.  55 appears to be the addendum which wasconcluded in respect of the King Shaka/Lusaka route, is that right?       Thank you and just to focus then on the particular costings which form part of the incentivisation scheme, if I could ask you to turn to page 56, paragraph 4 – sorry clause 4, 4.1 which specifically deals with preliminary activity costs that were contemplated in the previous memoranda, Dube Tradeport will contribute to the preliminary activity costs for the launch of the route to a maximum of R500 000 and that is as compared to the 5million rand originally contemplated in the memoranda, is that right?      Chair I note that we are on one minute to half past, may it be a convenient time now?    Mr Phiri we were talking about the addendum that starts on page 55 in relation to the King Shaka and Lusaka route.  Just on that score to follow up on the evidence that you gave earlier you were no longer at SA Express at the time that these addenda were then concluded, is that right?    And when you departed who did you hand the department – sorry – the Dube TradePort project over to?   And which role did he take?    Thank you.  If I could then ask you to turn to page 58 which is the signature page of this particular addenda – addendum.  Whose name appears for and on behalf of South African Express having signed on the 22 November 2012?    In particular it is noted GM Commercial below that, is that right?    If we could then resume where we had left off before the short adjournment and that is on page 56.  Forthe record paragraph 4.2 specifically talks to the preliminary activity costs will be drawn from the preliminary activities fund and will be utilised for route launch and marketing activities in advance of the commencement of the operation of the route, is that right?    And then paragraph – sorry I keep on referring to them as paragraph – clauses – clause 5 on page 57 speaks specifically to flight incentive costs.      Page 57 clause 5 talks to the flightincentive costs that were offered in respect of this route.    Having considered the detail and particularly having been looked at the comparative analysis between these agreements and the North West agreements it is recorded here that the ratings, the charges and the tariffs for the entitlements to claim are similar to as outlined in the memoranda but we can look at that on page 59 and 60 which details the charges that they were entitled to claim.      Okay.    Apologies.    Apologies.    Humble apologies Chair.  Paragraph 5 outlines the flight incentive costs.  That is on page 57.      Having considered this particular clause does it accord with the agreement set out in the memorandum of agreement in relation to flight incentive costs, the payment of it and the calculation of it?   In that regard can we then turn to page 59 where at annexure A it sets out the costing schedule.  Part B talks to the flight incentive costs and on the next page they give the detail of costs, is that right?    Can you clarify exactly what the amount of 14 079.11 means in the context of this particular addendum?  That sum is the cost per trip as found on page 59 of the bundle.    Yes so page 59 part B talks to flight incentive costs.  There is a rebate in relation to a CRJ200 aircraft and the cost per trip for 14 079.11, is that right?    Okay.  And if you then turn the page to page 60 you will see that that cost accords with the total reflected at the bottom of that page?    And how that amount is calculated is outlined in the table on page 60, is that right?    Now when you look at the detail of these different types of costings in the centre of the page is called ground handling, right?   For purposes of the record can you just clarify exactly which costs listed in here would all form part of ground handling?    And so if you look at page 60 is it correct then that ground handling services would include all the additional adhoc items listed there which should be aircraft towing,pushback, passenger assist unit which is for the acronym PAU, wheelchair, first bus, second bus, air starter unit and ground power unit which is the – for the acronym GPU.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Whilst we have now identified what the flight incentive costs would be it is recorded in clause 6 on page 57 that payment will be done in arrears.  So once again you have SA Express that incurs the cost and then claims back from Dube TradePort, is that right?    Okay.  If we could then turn to page 63 of the bundle.  And this is an addendum which was also concluded inrespect of the same route being King Shaka International Airport and Lusaka route and it was a follow up after the first addendum expired, is that right?    Okay.  If I could ask you to onceagain just confirm that the payment structure in relation to this addendum was no different to the first addendum that was concluded?    And if one looks particularly at page 65 paragraph 4.2 – sorry paragraph – I mean sorry clause 4.  Is it correct that there is no mention that is made of preliminary activity costs in here?    Okay.  And one of them main objects of preliminary costs related to route marketing and development.   If we can then turn to page 66.  For SA Express do you recognise any signatures that were appended on the 7 August 2013?    Thank you Chair.  And then if you turn to page 67 at which annexure A and the costing schedule is reflected page 68 once again refers to an itemised costings cost process or not process sorry – an itemised claim in respect of different types of costs, is that right?    Okay.  That then concludes the addenda in relation to the first route.  If we could turn then to page 60 – apologies page 70.  It is an addendum which is dated November 2013 and it specifically relates to the King Shaka Harare route as concluded between Dube TradePort and South African Express.     Once again if I can ask you to turn to page 73.  Do you recognise any of the signatures who signed on behalf of SA Express during November of 2013?    Thank you.  And then just to place this particular document into context.  On page 71 para – clause…    Thank you.  To put this particular addendum into context on page 71 clause 3.1C records that this particular addendum supersedes the first addendum which we do not have before us.  And on page 72 like with the second addendum in respect of the other route there appears to be a similar process on theflight incentivisation costs and the process of claiming, is that right?    In particular at para – in clause 5.1 once again it is outlined that the payment methodology is such that SA Express incurs the debt and then claims the amount back from DubeTradePort?    Now these particular amounts that have been recorded in the annexures to the addenda would they be contemplated to cover all of the costs for the operation of these routes or only part of the costs?    Thank you.  Then in summary ofthese particular agreements the common thread between the Dube TradePort agreements and please correct me if I am wrong is that on the one hand you have a preliminary activities fund from which certain costings can be claimed, is that right?    Part of those claims which should be a claim entitlement would be flight incentive costs?    And these flight incentive costs in particular were cost contributions that were calculated on clear public tariffs?    Published tariffs sorry.    Published gazetted tariffs.  The claimprocess for how these claims are to take place are clearly outlined.    The payment entitlement is payment in arrears.    And so the flight incentive costs essentially because of the itemised claims computes to a maximum amount that may be claimable in relation to a specific type of costs or relative to a specific type of aircraft, is that correct?    And so in so doing the flight incentive costs are also based on actual flights and it is also based on qualifying flight costs as we have dealt with through the different agreements.    I can then ask you to now turn to page 12 of your affidavit.  Paragraph 44 talks about monies that SA Express in fact claimed during the year of 2014 and in particular it is listed that out of the total of 3 882 984,27 that total form – includes costs relating to landing, parking, packs handling, presumably passenger handling and ramp handling or aircraft handling.  Is that correct?    And that was the total sum that was claimed over a twelve month period during 2014?   Are there any costings there that are excluded from operations costs that may have been claimed?    Okay.      And that total cost then of 4.8 would really constitute a contribution towards the total cost of operation on these particular routes, is that correct?    Okay.  Having concluded…    Thank you Chair.  If I could ask youto turn to page 88 of your bundle.  There appears to be some gazetted publications.  Are these in fact the rates that you have provided which were relevant for purposes of the rebates during that particular period?    Okay.  If we can now then turn to the North West’s suite of agreements which have already been traversed through the evidence of Mr Ngwenya of yesterday.  Based on that evidence we do not intend to go into particular detail as it has alreadybeen addressed yesterday.  Could I ask you to turn to page 107 please?  Do you recognise this document as you have considered it?    And what is it?    Thank you.  And it is correct that thisagreement was the foundation or rather the contractual foundation which reintroduced an air transportation service from OR Tambo International airport, Cape Town International airport, Pilanesberg and Mafikeng?    And in particular the agreement was concluded on the basis of subsidy being given by the North West government to South African Express?    Can I ask you to turn to page 144please.      144.    In line with your signatureidentifications of earlier can you please identify who signed this agreement on behalf of SA Express?    Thank you.  Noting that Brian van …  Based on the fact that Mr Brian van Wyk had witnessed this agreement and has also in one or other capacity been involved in the conclusion of the addenda between Dube TradePort and South African Express.    Would it be fair to understand thatMr Brian van Wyk was familiar with the agreements or rather the addenda under the Dude TradePort Project and this particular agreement?    Who was the owner according to yourknowledge of the Pilanesberg and Mafikeng Airports?    Okay.  If we can then look at page 14 of the bundle and just to confirm evidence that was – rathersubmissions and evidence that was presented yesterday in relation to the agreement Chair. This contract was indeed for a period of five years which was from the effective date and the effective date is reckoned on page 1-1-0 of the bundle to mean 27 March 2015 in respect of certain routes and 1 May 2015 in respect of the other and SA Express in particular agreed to operate the two airports using the CRJ200 Aircraft and in doing so to provide crew distribution sales and airline operational infrastructure. Mr Phiri when we look at then paragraph - sorry – page 1-1-5 to focus in on this contribution of costings in order for us to comparethe apples with apples scenario between Dube TradePort and the North West Suites of Agreements.  So page 1-1-5 paragraph – Clause 4.3    Page 1-4-5.    Just for the record then Mr Phiri you are at page 1-4-5?    There appears to be a series of subsidies.  The first relates to a concession.  The second relates to route marketing and the last relates to operations costs.  Is that right?    And these subsidies are in relation to the two airports.  One being Pilanesberg and the other one being Mafikeng.    Please explain to the Chair what operations costs – sorry – let us start from the top.  What concession as an airline subsidy could be possibly mean or relate to?    Okay and then the next category of costs is called the route marketing subsidy.  What is your understanding of the route marketing subsidy?   So just to – to amplify on what you said.  Under the Dube TradePort you spoke …    To amplify or clarify what you said. Under the Dube TradePort it was contemplated that you are looking at about a three month period before the launch of the first flight that you would need to invest for purposes of marketing that particular new route.  Is that right?    But in this particular instance there is a subsidy which is granted over a five year period?    How long does it normally taken then to have a new route fully functional and fully operational as part ofordinary routes?    And then if one were to look at the actual route marketing subsidy that was allocated to Pilanesberg and to Mafikeng respectively in year one.  It was an approximate amount of 14. – 14.6 to 14.8 million.  In year two it was 4.8 million.  In year three it was 4.5 million.In year four it was 4.5 million and in year five it was also 4.5 million.  Do you have any comments to the costings or rather to the subsidies that have been granted over this five year period in relation to route marketing in particular?    Okay.  If you could …    The last category of costs is termedoperations costs and for each of the two routes an amount is allocated to each of those routes at 11 million for each of years one to five.  Is that right?    Now how does operations costs compare to the concessions that is referred to above in this table?    In your experience how would these costs compare to the average cost of operating a CRJ200 Aircraft 50 seater?    Just to excuse my ignorance what exactly is a frequency?    And so the numbers that you are given are really operations costs.  Is that right?    And the costings that you have given then would that include ground handling costs?    Now if you were to look at this table again it is subdivided into two levels.  The first relates to the airline.  The second relates to the management company.  Effectively on the average costing that you have given which ranges between 12 topossibly even early 20 million per annum the management company subsidy is aggregated to 11 million over the – over the five year period whilst the concession applying to the airline which is SA Express in this instance ranges between 11 million to 30 – to 34 million over the – over the full period.  Is that right?   So effectively the subsidy that has been provided here would you say that it would be a partial rebate to the incurring of costs or could it amount to more?    Can I then ask you to turn to page 16 - 1-6 - of the bundle and having considered then the four groundhandling agreements the first being commonly referred to as the PAMCO Agreement concluded with Pilanesberg Airport Management Company. The second being with MAMCO being the Mafikeng Airport Management Company.  The third being Valoteck Facilities Management CC and the Koreneka Event Manager or rather the agreement concluded with Koreneka Event Manager trading as Koreneka Trading and Projects.  You have considered all of these four ground handling agreements.  Is that right?    Chair just for the record these agreements appear from Annexures 8.1 to 8.4 of the bundle.  This table represents your consolidated analysis of the services that were contracted from each of the service providers.  Is that right?    And in particular the services that you have identified which were contracted by each of them following the correction that you have made was airport management …  Passenger handling, ramp handling/aircraft handling and route development or marketing.  Is that right?    Thanks to the – thanks to your assistance to the Commission you have also provided a – an agreementbetween SAA and SA Express in relation to passenger handling at the King Shaka International Airport.  Is that right?  And that particular agreement appears at Tab 9 from page 2-6-3.  Whilst certain agreements between ourselves and SAA have resulted in redactions to annexures to this agreement based on your personal knowledge is it correct that the rates that are charged in particular to passenger handling at the different airports are charged at rates per different types of aircraft?    And so there is a clear table although that particular detail is not placed before the Commission due to redactions but there is a clear table that is incorporated in respect of each airport under the annexures to this agreement which clearly identifies set costs as opposed to a globular amount.   Thanks to your assistance as well if I could ask you to turn to page 17 – 1-7 – you have also provided us with – rather you have provided the Commission with the Standard Ground Handling Agreement concluded between SA Express and Menzies Aviation?    That particular agreement appears from page 3-0-7 of the bundle.  If I could ask you quickly to turn to page 3-1-2 – sorry.  Sorry – it is 3-0-9.  I am getting my numbersconfused.  You have provided this particular agreement to look at the basis of rates payable specific – specific to ramp handling.  Is that correct?    And so as appears on page 3-0-9 once again you have ramp handling costs which are rated according to particular types of aircraft.    Is it therefore correct that in terms of the two agreements – additional agreements that you have provided theone being the ground handling concluded between SAA and SA Express.  The other one being between SA Express and Menzies that the very basis for claiming is a rate that is clearly defined specific to a type of aircraft?    How does – how does this pricing formula compare to the ground handling agreements as you have dealt with in the table which appears on page 16 such being the MAMCO, PAMCO, Koreneka and Valoteck?       Thank you, if I can now ask you to please turn to page 19 of the bundle, because in as much as you compare the Dube Tradeport’s suite of agreements with the North West’s suite of agreements you’ve amplified certain aspects to the claim and payment methodologies specific to passenger handling on the S A Express handling agreement, ramp handling agreement in relationto the S A Express and the Menzi’s agreement and then what you also then do, is that you now deal with marketing spend of S A Express generally.  If you could keep your finger on this particular page and open to page 145 which is the annexure to the main agreement, that details the different subsidies.  So at page 19 – so keep page 19 openbut also keep page 145 open, so at page 19 you detail then the marketing spend of S A Express as it’s recorded in the management accounts which, just for the record, is attached as Annexure 11 Chair that appears from page 349.  Can I ask you to just place on record the annual marketing spend for the financial years of 2014/2015.       Is it correct that the financials for S A Express has in fact been audited, signed off but not yet released?       For the financial years of 18/2019.       Thank you Chair.  This market spend, does it relate to existing routes or does it include new routes as well?       And on your reasonableness point can we then turn to page 145, while keeping your finger still at page 19, the spend for the financial year 2014/2015 was 1.9million and that included existing and three additional routes.       As compared to the route marketing subsidy for the two new routes which for, in year one, totalled approximately 28million, year two 9million, year three, four and five also 9million.  One last point then and that is in relation to the new route that you – that S A Express launched during December of 2018can you please provide the Chair with an overview as to the – without necessarily having to mention any detail because the price sensitivities have been redacted and doesn’t form part of this Commission, but can you just give a brief overview to the Chair in relation to the market spend on the new route launched during December 2018 as compared to the costings of these subsidies as well.      Chair before I close in all fairness to this witness, he wasn’t provided with a copy of Annexure 1 to the Koreneka agreement which has been presented as part of Mr Ngwenya’s evidence yesterday but he has just briefly looked at it this morning.  On that particular Annexure, having looked at it quite briefly this morning, does it change your position in relation to the costings on the ground handling agreements?       Then just to summarise some of the observations that you’ve given through your evidence on the North West agreements, as compared to the clear parameters of claimentitlements and payment processes reconciled in, under the Dube Tradeport suite of agreements, is it correct that the North West suite of agreements which comprises of your main agreements and then the four ground handling agreements which were effective at some or other stage, dealt with advancing a subsidy to S A Express, is that right?       And that particular subsidy related to a subsidy provided to S A Express and also to management company whichever it may have been at any particular point in time.       And the management company’s subsidy was split between route marketing and operating costs.       And in particular as compared to the arrear payment methodology under the Dube Tradeport agreement this particular subsidy was paid in advance before any work would have taken place, likely, within that particular financial year.       What are your concluding observations when looking at the Dube Tradeport contract, structureand management as compared to the North West Contract – the North West suite of agreements, contracts, structure and management?       Thank you Chair, there’s no furtherquestions from our side.      There’s no further questions from our side.        Chair with your leave I’ve been requested to ask that you please warn Ms Phatudi who was summoned to be here today for appearance tomorrow.     Yes Ms Phatudi.    
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?    Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?
