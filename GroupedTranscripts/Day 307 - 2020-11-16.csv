CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.      Are we ready? ADV PRETORIUS    Yes before he does that I think maybe he can just place on record that they are here and they represent the former President and before we start with the – with argument I would want to read some statements that I told Counsel about.    Yes.  Maybe he should come to the podium.  Somebody must just sanitise before you do Mr Sikhakhane. I just take this opportunity to remind everybody about social distancing.  There is enough space for people to leave quite some distance between themselves.  Covid-19 is still with us.  Mr Sikhakhane.    Good morning Mr Sikhakhane.    Thank you very much.  Before we start with the application for recusal I would like to read into the record a statement that I have made.  I have informed Counsel in chambers about it.  It is a statement to address the issue of personal relationship between myself and Mr Zuma as raised in his affidavit filed in support of his application for my recusal.  Copies of the statement will be given to Counsel and then we will proceed.  The statement has been made following a precedent that was established by the Constitutional Court in the case of Dr Luyt and Sarfu or in the case of President Mandela versus Dr Luyt and Sarfu. In that case Dr Luyt had made an application for the recusal of the President of the Constitutional Court Justice Arthur Cheskalson the Deputy President of the Constitutional Court at that time Justice Pius Langa and four other Justices of the Constitutional Court and he had raised a number of matters on the basis of which he sought their recusal. They prepared a statement of facts or clarification of certain matters and read it – or it was read into the record by the President of the Constitutional Court. So I have sought to follow that precedent.  The    Thank you Mr Sikhakhane.    Yes, yes.    But I must also before you do that I must also thank you and your team for understanding with regard to the statement that had not been given to you in advance.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Ja.    Yes.    Just one second before you do that Mr Sikhakhane.  Sorry about that Mr Sikhakhane.     Thank you.  You know, I...  You said you are now going to take me to the cases and so on.  So I have a particular copy of SARFU that I had looked at and you know when you look at one ...[intervenes]      ...on which you have not made any underlining’s, it is not as helpful as the one that you have used.     But that is fine.       No, no.  That is fine.  I just wanted the SARFU.  But I will get it because ...[intervenes]      ...I have made some notes.       But it is fine.     Yes.     Yes, okay, okay.     Of course, I have not said that.     [laughing]       I have not said that.  [laughing]       I have not found.  [laughing]       Oh, okay.     Ja.     Before we get to that and maybe we will take the tea adjournment and then [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     But I wanted to raise – we will go to the comments as you have indicated in due course.  You know, when I was still new in practice as a lawyer going to the lower courts, appearing full of enthusiasm, coming from university and, you know, one of the experiences I had in some of the courts in which I appeared were cases where I would appear before a presiding officer and I present argument and the presiding officer just keeps quiet.  I go on and on and I quote authorities, in this case, this is what happened, in this case, this is what happened, these are the principles.  The presiding officer just sits and keeps quiet.  I never get to know whether – what he or she is thinking, I would never get to know and then maybe one question there but sometimes no question and at the end of argument, either immediately or later, judgment is given and when I read the judgment I say, you know, I do not think he or she understood the argument.  If only she had engaged me and questioned the submissions that I was making because then we would have had an engagement and I would have clarified some of the things.     Of course, somebody sitting there could say oh, this magistrate or presiding officer is very impartial, he said nothing, she said nothing, she just listened, you know?  But I must say that I preferred those who would question what I am saying so that we could engage in a debate because then I could tell if I was persuading him or her and also I could tell when he or she puts up a point for which I have no answer, you know, so when you get the judgment you feel that look, I was heard properly because whatever difficulties the presiding officer may have had inside, as I presenting my argument, he or she verbalised them and I was able to address them, but the one who keeps quiet throughout, you might think she or he has no problem, but maybe she does have problems but she does not tell you and you feel the unfairness when you see the judgment.     So but I raise this point in relation to the issue of comments, to which we will come, to say one of the benefits of the Commission proceedings being televised and so on is that persons, whether implicated or not, can listen or watch as a particular witness gives evidence and sometimes I put certain questions, I put certain remarks, because I am thinking when the person who is being implicated comes here, hopefully they are listening or they will read the transcript, I want them to know what was going on in my mind as I was listening to this witness, so that they can address it, I am not hiding it from them.     If I like I could just sit quietly, do not indicate what I am thinking but the benefit to the implicated person, if I speak, is that they can, when they come and say you know, Chair, when this witness who implicated me was speaking, this is what you said, I want to take this opportunity to show you that that is not the position.  So at least it is meant as part of transparency rather than just keep quiet and say so this person that they are talking about is such a bad person but, you know?  So I just mention that and …[intervenes]     And you may address it …[intervenes]     Yes, sure.     Ja.  No, no, no, that is fine.     Let us take the tea adjournment, we are at 18 minutes past eleven.  Let us resume at twenty five to twelve.       We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Yes, Mr Sikhakhane?     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.  No, no, that is fine.     I think in the SARFU matter the statements were given to – by the justice of the court to counsel and counsel and their clients accepted the statement of facts.  So that is what happened there, ja.     Ja, yes.     Okay.  Okay, alright.     Oh, yes.     Ja.     Oh. Ja, let me have it.  But from what you say it looks like I might not need to bother to read now because you do not say much about it in your address.     Yes, yes.     Yes, okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I am sorry, I just want to make sure I have got the right page.     Oh, I think I went to 33 at the bottom but you meant 33 at the top?     The red numbers, is that right?     The red numbers?     Oh, okay, okay.     Oh, okay.  No, that is fine.     I recognise the concession, I do not know if it is a concession, but the point you make that standing on its own this is not your strongest point but I do want to raise this question.  Is it open to a witness or a person such as Mr Zuma to complain about those – or what emerges from those witnesses in circumstances where he had the opportunity to apply for leave to cross-examine them and get somebody like you to basically deal with their versions and by the time they leave the witness stand there is a complete picture that has emerged from the picture they may have painted at the beginning but chose not to do so.     In other words, there may be an argument that says it does not matter what sequence different witnesses follow in being brought to give evidence as long as there is a fair opportunity given to the people they implicate, for example, to challenge their evidence and cross-examine them and show them to be persons who have maybe some gripe with them or some scores to settle, that is why they say a, b, c, d about them.   Of course, if you do not that, you to come and actually cross-examine them, challenge what they have to say, whatever evidence they have given might remain in the minds of the people whereas if you had used that opportunity, what would remain is what the picture looked like after an effective cross-examination.     Ja.     Yes.     Well, not necessarily an hour.  What is done is – well, I think actually the counsel who cross-examined him ultimately cross-examined him for no less than two hours but, you know, an application is made and argument is addressed and we take into account what you have to say.     Very often – I have said this recently – very often counsel who have cross-examined have found - have been able to cross-examine within that hour or two hours.  I cannot remember – I remember one, I do not know if it is the one who was cross-examining Mr Jonas, who had some concerns but the discussions ended up with him saying no, it is fine, you can send some submissions.     So the idea is to try and strike a balance with taking too long but at the same time try and make sure that there is fairness.   So you would have applied, Mr Sikhakhane, and if an hour or two hours was not enough, we would have looked at …[intervenes]     Ja.  No, that is alright.     Okay.     Mr Sikhakhane, I am sorry to interrupt you.     I just want to note the second ground without going to the affidavit.     Did you want to just to mention it …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, well, just one point.  The affidavit I think does not say how – what it is that should have happened between the time he gave evidence and now to reflect that the Commission has not ignored it.  Obviously you cannot – you cannot give evidence, lead evidence but I am just raising that I have seen that in the affidavit.     But, I mean, I – you will remember I allowed him, you know, time to say what he had to say until he said well, it is fine for now.     I will see some other time.  So – and of course one was going to wait for him to come back and then take it from there.     Yes.  No, no, that  is fine.  You know, last week, I think on Friday, the witness or least one of the witnesses – the only witness, I think, who was giving evidence was Mr Zuma’s former attorney, Mr Mantsha, and evidence had been given that affected him in relation to when he was Chairperson of Denel and evidence had been given from last year to the effect that certain executives were suspended at Denel and the board that he was chairing was involved and that they were suspended for no reason, it was part of getting rid of people who were not prepared to do certain wrong things and so on. So last year we tried a number of times to get Mr Mantsha to file an affidavit and respond to the allegations or evidence by Mr Saloojee, for example, and so on, but he did not.  So when he came to give evidence on Friday and then I think he came after – there may have been a Regulation 10.6 directive issued - he then said they were dismissed for misconduct and then he said – put up a certain story about what they had done and I said, you know, I just wish he had come and responded last year because at that time we still had a lot of time to investigate what he was saying they were dismissed for, but he was now telling us towards the tail end of the last [indistinct] of the Commission, some of the investigators are gone, others are still happy to do whatever.  So sometimes there are challenges when things come late, but I am just mentioning …[intervenes]     So we are on comments now? ADV     Ja, okay.  Shall we take that as the third ground or what, the comments?     Okay.     What paragraph?     Yes.     Okay no that is fine.     Yes, okay.     Well before you go to this is that the second one the passage or another passage?      Oh okay, you see I think what was happening here is I had listened to the witness, she had said certain things about what Mr Zuma had said to her in the telephone conversation and I sought to clarify from her whether my understanding of what she was telling me was correct, and you will see that I see on the face of it this seems to me to be what you are saying but also it seems when she responds it is quite – seems important she does not say yes that is what I mean, she says that is one possibility certainly.  Another possibility is that – she puts another possibility, which might mean I sought to have clarification of what she meant and in responding she said well it could mean two things.  I just mentioned that ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay.     You refer to the President – oh – oh ...[intervenes]      Oh I think that must – well I am not sure but I am thinking it may have been presidents, meaning past ministers I am not sure but one may have to – I doubt that I meant a specific president, I doubt that. But ...[intervenes]      Ja yes, ja.     Ja, ja.     Yes.     I’m sorry where are you reading now?  I want to check this time because of the reference to President ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes.     Oh okay yes, now I see yes, yes, yes.     Of course when one looks at excerpts or extracts from a transcript such as this it is important to have the whole context, because this would have been a witness, an exchange when a witness is on the witness stand and that witness has put in an affidavit where he has told the story and it may be that a question is put in a certain way, because everybody understands what is written in the affidavit, so it may well be important to have that affidavit in order to have a full context of the extracts.     Yes.     Okay, okay.     Yes.     Let us assume that they reflect an acceptance of certain evidence that has been given, would you accept that there would be nothing wrong with that if that acceptance is provisional, in other words until I hear the other side, until I hear what has happened, in other words well maybe this is – maybe this version without contradictory evidence may be it is too – but I will wait until I have heard all the evidence and I can change my mind, I am open, in other words isn’t the fundamental thing whether whatever you think of a certain witness evidence at a particular time that you must at least keep your mind open and be prepared to change whatever you thought once there is good contradictory evidence or arguments and so on.       Ja, I am just posing it ja.      Yes, of course if we go back to our earlier example, much earlier before tea break and of course when you make, I mean how you make a comment is also important you know.  If you talk about – if you contrast that example of a judge or magistrate who says you know women are gold diggers then you have another one who actually thinks like that inside but doesn’t say it.      So that ja I guess one needs to be sensitive.     One needs to be sensitive to all of these things.     I have read them, I can assure you.      But I think we must talk a little bit about that because I saw in correspondence and the affidavit that I am accused of having disbelieved or not believed that Mr Zuma was not well, and yet my recollection that I never said anything that suggested that I didn’t believe it   Your referred earlier on to the fact that I reluctantly agreed to the offer to meet with the leader of his medical team.  That reluctance I think was mainly about whether we should go that far, but my understanding was that the – Mr Zuma and his legal team wanted that to happen, but I expressed my reluctance even when we came back, we discussed in chambers but when we came back in the open hearing I pressed that reluctance but I said I’d accept it.     Yes, yes.      Well I can tell you that in two and a half months time I will be finishing 24 years on the bench and this is the first time an application is brought for me to recuse myself, but it is brought by you, but you know there is nothing wrong with an application for recusal when people feel aggrieved, it is a remedy that is available and should be considered so – but I was just saying that in 24 years this has not happened, but there is always a first time.     No, no that is fine, we are ten to one, thank you Mr Sikhakhane, thank you very much.      Thank you, thank you.  Yes Mr Pretorius?     Ja, okay it is ten to one, let us take the lunch adjournment and then come back at two.     Yes, we adjourn.     I am sure you are ready Mr Pretorius.    But I am going to ask Mr Sikhakhane to come back so that I can raise certain legal issues with him and then he will come back later.    I am sorry to bring you back when you thought you were done.    I noticed that you paid particular attention to your prayer number 2.    In the Notice of Motion.  May – I have some questions about prayer number 1 and this is the question and I think from your address I could tell that you do expect me to ask certain questions about it.   The question is whether as a matter of law recusal for the Chairperson of a commission who is the sole member of the commission is competent?  So some commissions you have got two or three members of the commission as a panel.   It may be that if there is a witness who feels that a particular member of that panel is biased that that witness may apply for the recusal of that member for the duration of his or her evidence.  But even there it may be that it cannot be done but maybe it is a better situation.  But where you are dealing with a situation such as that of this commission where the commission consists of one member – sole member if I recuse myself what happens?    Ja.    Ja.  Yes.    Yes, no, no.    Well you see it might not be a question of me and the President particularly in the context of this commission.  Maybe the same issues would arise with another commission but this particular one because remember that the – the remedial action the Public Protector said that the commission which would investigate all of these issues must be chaired by a Judge selected I think solely by the Chief Justice obviously appointed by the President. Now you said earlier on that you referred to the fact that maybe the commission should not have consisted of one member because of its importance. When I – when I – after I had been appointed I applied my mind to that issue to say this is a very big commission should I request the President to appoint others members maybe one or preferably two members of the commission so that I am not the only one.  And when I considered whether to make such a recommendation or request the problem that I foresee was that if there were two members added it could result into a situation where when the report is made the member of the commission that had been selected in accordance with the remedial action of the Public Protector could be overruled by the members of the commission who had never been contemplated by their remedial action and that could cause problems. And then of course there was the question if you make it too there could also be challenges.  And of course there is the issue that we are not just dealing with what the remedial action of the Public Protector said there is an order of court which reinforced that remedial action. So there is an order of court effectively which says – which said the President must appoint a Judge selected by the Chief Justice.  So if I were to for argument sake say I think Mr Sikhakhane has made out a very good case for recusal I must recuse myself that means that there is a vacuum or do I say okay what should happen?  Should another Judge be appointed to hear Mr Zuma’s evidence and then the question is how would that work because I am the one who has heard other witnesses who may have implicated him.  How does it happen now if another Judge is going to hear his evidence responding to those witnesses who were heard by me?  Will that Judge have to re-hear those – it becomes complex. And of course the President even the appointment of that Judge who must appoint that Judge because if the President appoints there might be a question whether that is proper given that the remedial action did not have that or that is not proper.  There may be all kinds of argument. So there are those issues and I think part of what you have been saying you have said to me is; is that it may be that a recusal would collapse the commission. So you – you then say to me but Chair if my client has got good grounds to complain that you may be biased; that he fears that you may have made up your mind on certain issues what happens? It may be that the answer in circumstances such as these is this one and one would accept that it might not be the best answer.  It may well be and you must just indicate what you – what your submissions are that in a situation such as this you are expected as the aggrieved witness to complain later in a review application because if you complain later in a review application maybe if you are successful the court can set aside findings that relate to you if nobody else has complained the other findings stand. I am just thinking aloud and I would like us to look at it.  I know you have thought about the issue.    And that is why I – I want to benefit from …    Your submissions.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh yes.    Ja.    Yes.    [Inaudible talking over one another].    Yes ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Okay no that is alright.  So maybe let me hear Mr Pretorius and it may well be that after I have heard everybody there might be a need for a discussion irrespective of what would happen with the application.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Okay thank you Mr Sikhakhane.      Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Sorry Mr Pretorius.  I am not sure – not completely sure that you are right and Mr Sikhakhane is also right when you say if a witness has shown that in this case there is a reasonable apprehension of bias I should recuse myself.  That it always follows it cannot be otherwise.   The reason why I am raising that is that we – we all know that there are circumstances where somebody – a Judge who is disqualified from sitting is allowed to sit because there is no other one who will not be disqualified to sit the doctrine of necessity.    So – so I am – I just want to raise that because I do not want you or Mr Sikhakhane to necessarily think that I accept the proposition that if we reach a point where it was to be said that there are reasonable grounds.  It seems to me on the fact of it and now I am talking principle – it seems to me that you may well have a case where you say well you have to sit conflicted as you are if you talking about conflict and you just have to do your best to be fair.  I mean you – we – we know cases where judges hear cases dealing with legislation; dealing with their own salaries where they are all conflicted because this legislation is about their benefits.  But there is nobody else whoever hears the case has to be a judge.  So they have to do the best they can to – to be fair and to disregard their own interests and give judgments.    Ja.    Hm.    Leave out negotiate.  Leave out negotiate.    Ja.    Ja.  Okay.  No that is fine.    Of course.    Yes.    Yes I do.    But the whole concept of respondent in this application …    Well both the first respondent and second I did not raise this with Mr Sikhakhane because it did not occur but at a practical level it might not mean anything you know.  My understanding is that if you bring a review application for a – an application for recusal before the particular presiding officer that precedent will say it is not a respondent.   You do not cite them as a respondent.  You cite them a respondent when you go on review to set aside their decision not to recuse themselves.   Of course the secretary I am not sure…    Why would – why they would come in.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Well I think proceed and Mr Sikhakhane will still come back and reply so he can indicate what his position is.     Yes, you are.     H’m.     Well, I am not aware that I do have.  Are they here?     Do I have Mr Sikhakhane’s ones as well because I saw him reading from a notebook.  I assumed he did not have any but I do not know.  Mr Sikhakhane, do you have them?     Okay thank you.       Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  Yes, Mr Pretorius.     I think SARFU says    Ja, on the correct...     H’m.     I may have misunderstood Mr Sikhakhane.  I got the impression that he was not relying on that but maybe he was.  Maybe you should address it in case ...[intervenes]      Okay.     That is different from – that page number is different from the paginated number. ADV PRETORIUS     Oh, okay.  Okay.     Okay.       I am sorry.  I am trying to locate the answering affidavit.  Is that in the ...[intervenes]      ...the red file?     After what – which divider?     Are you able to give me the paginated number, the red numbers?     78.  Oh, I thought you said the answering affidavit.  78 is the applicant’s founding affidavit.  So I was looking for the wrong ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Okay I have got it.     [No audible reply]      What is the right page or paragraph?     The red numbers?     No, Mr Pretorius.  I think your team did not put in the answering affidavit here.  I have got 646 here, 647 and then the next is 697.  There is something missing.  I read it last night.  So.     But you can ...[intervenes]      Ja, I am familiar.  You can read it.     I have got it ja.     I wanted to say something, Mr Pretorius, but, as I say, it is more for Mr Sikhakhane to hear so that when he comes back, when he replies, he has thought about if he needs to think about it and he can deal with it.   Well, Mr Sikhakhane has said that the case is not that of bias, as such, it is apprehension of bias but of course I think some correspondence – and I do not know whether the affidavit as well, but it is some correspondence suggested, as I read it, that it is bias and I was concerned – and of course there was some correspondence, I think that he was talking about predetermined outcome and things like that and I was thinking, you know, if you are – if I am biased against a particular witness and that witness has been given 3.3 notices and has elected not to challenge the evidence of witnesses who implicate or may be said to implicate him, if I am biased against that witness, seems to me the easiest way would be not to insist that that witness should come but to say okay, just take all the evidence against that witness because of course my findings when he has not brought his evidence to put his side of the story, that is going to based on that.  But when you want to hear all sides, one wants to weigh everything so that you do not make findings based on just one side of witnesses, I would have thought that it would be seen as somebody who really wants to hear all sides before making a finding rather than say well, you got a change to challenge this evidence, you have elected not to challenge, so it is fine, we will go ahead with the witnesses who have given evidence.  So but based on Mr Sikhakhane’s submissions, I think that may have fallen away, but he might  be able to say something.     Of course Covid 19 happened this year and the affidavits should have been filed or delivered sometime last year.     Yes.     Well, you see, and again this is something …[intervenes]     I mention more for Mr Sikhakhane than for you, one gets concerned if there is undertaking made to say we will file affidavits by whatever agreed date and then not only are the affidavits not filed but no attempt is made to show courtesy of an explanation to say we have some difficulties, these are our difficulties, can you accommodate us, or ask for an extension of time, one gets more concerned when one deals with that situation.     Did you say paragraph 41 of the founding affidavit?           I will find it, yes I have got it.      Can one ever in a Commission such as this recuse oneself from hearing the witness the evidence of a specific witness or certain specific witnesses but hearing, but hear the rest of the witnesses?       I guess in that situation if it comes back to you, you still have to see somebody else making a finding and you are bound by it.  It is different maybe if they make a recommendation and you can then make a finding in regard to such a matter.        Ja, I am saying it is difficult to see a situation where somebody else you made an example of some medical expert making a finding and then you are bound by it as Chairperson.  It is different if they make a recommendation which you can examine and if you are persuaded it is right then you accept but there are all kinds of difficulties that might need to be looked at because in the end the findings in the context of this Commission must be the findings of the Judge selected by the Chief Justice.   If it is findings is made by somebody else that might be problematic because the remedial action said these issues must be investigated and decided upon by a Judge selected by the Chief Justice and not by the President.        Yes, ja.        Ja, okay.        Yes, okay.       Are you talking about the founding affidavit on 32 so what document are you talking about?       At page 32 I have got paragraphs 46, 47 and 48 and you said paragraph fifty something.       Let us stick to the red numbers.       Yes, I have got that were you referring to paragraph 32?  Were you referring to paragraph 32?     53?     There is no paragraph 53 at page 26 and you said it is the red numbers.      Page 26 red 26 only has paragraph …[intervene]     Okay I have got it.       Ja, paragraph 53.2.       It is better if we are consistent and use the red ones, the red page numbers of course you can say mention both, I think you said Mr Zuma’s legal team might not have the red pagination.          Okay.       Okay.    Thank you Mr Pretorius, Mr Sikhakhane?  Maybe, I see it’s four o’clock maybe we should take a short break, ten minutes, ja let’s – well earlier on we took a tea break and maybe, because of the numbers of people it’s difficult for everybody to come back on time, should I make it twenty minutes or, what do you think, Mr Pretorius and Mr Sikhakhane, guide me?      [Laughter].      Okay, then maybe – I thought you might…[intervenes].      Yes, okay, alright then maybe let me hear Mr Sikhakhane because I thought it might take long.      Okay. ADV      What paragraph?      Okay thank you Mr Sikhakhane.  We are going to adjourn for the day, and we’ll resume tomorrow morning at ten.  I’m going to use the evening and the night to consider all these submissions that have been made by both sides.  The idea will be to try and arrive at a decision as soon as possible but we will see when I arrive tomorrow, what the position is.   So, I would like to be able to give my decision tomorrow at ten but if by that time, it’s not ready I’ll be here and then, indicate what the position is but I’ll use the – I will consider, overnight all these submissions.  Don’t forget, Mr Sikhakhane to let me have your written submissions but I would like to see counsel once I’ve adjourned, ja both sides.      Thank you.  Alright, we are going to adjourn then, and we’ll resume tomorrow morning at ten.  We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Yes Chair.     Chair may I suggest that we take the long adjournment now and come back when you direct.     Thank you Chair.    Yes I am Chair.    Thank you Chair.      Thank you Chair.      Firstly in response to the discussion that has now taken place I would obviously like to think about it and    Prepare an answer for you.    But our initial view is clear Chair that if there are grounds for your recusal you must recuse yourself.  There is no halfway in these circumstances where you can negotiate how to proceed with a particular witness despite the fact that that witness has proved or shown that you are guilty of such bias as to warrant recusal.  I am afraid in that sense if you are however guilty of bias then there may be room for dealing from a practical point of view but we would need to think very carefully about treating a witness differently from another witness simply because they might be implicated or have fears about what your final findings might be. So let me think about that and we will come to you Chair. Chair I am afraid there is another matter that I must deal with and that is the reply that was served on us this morning.    Yes Chair.     Chair we are not here dealing with the conflict of interest.    We dealing with a notion of situation where it has been shown that you are guilty of bias in relation to central issues Chair.    Let me put it this way.  Subject to the doctrine of necessity and we will address you on the doctrine of necessity because it is part of our approach and it is in our heads of argument.  That is a separate issue. But certainly the solution cannot be given the principles that apply it cannot be that you can then negotiate with a particular witness in a particular situation …    Well you do not negotiate.    But that is the invitation.  The invitation Chair is let us talk about a different solution other than your recusal on the basis that you are guilty of bias in respect of that particular witness.  For us we have difficulty with that proposition but we will deal with it in due course.    Because there are – there is not one person with an interest in the proceedings that are before you.      There are hundreds and there are thousands and any one of them might come and say but you were conflicted you proceeded and you treated that witness with some special dispensation notwithstanding that you accepted that you were guilty of bias in respect of him. It raises all sorts of problems for a later review which you have been told Chair is coming.  In any event Chair may I move on?   We will address you properly on that.    And we do not act or take issue with the principle of necessity that even though you may be conflicted but that is a matter of general application involving or not necessarily one witness who complains of bias. Chair we were served with a replying affidavit this morning.  My learned friend said we do not have to worry about it but I am afraid unless it is withdrawn we do have to worry about it because in it the applicant makes allegations firstly that the secretary is not authorised to depose to the affidavit and the legal team is not authorise to intervene in this matter.  So that – there are two allegations. One that and if I may refer you; do you have it before you Chair.    If you go to paragraph 14 line 4 takes issue with the fact that the legal team is defending this    Well the second respondent was cited as a respondent.    Well Chair.    In essence if I may go on to    I do not want it to be brought up at a later stage.    Not having been dealt with.     So then, do we have your assurance, both the secretary, so I can rely on the answering affidavit, and the legal team that we are acting under your direction?     Thank you, Chair.     Chair, having listened carefully to my learned friend, whose submissions before you ranged from detailed submissions of fact and reference to the record, through to allegations of political conspiracies and the like. Fortunately, our approach is that the law will provide an answer.  Fortunately, in situations like these, however contested and by whatever extreme views they may be contested on either side, the law does provide an answer and we will deal with it by reference to legal principles and facts.   At the outset Chair, listening to my learned friend in his address.  It was difficult where we need to draw the line between what the case being brought before you for recusal was and what the case was not. First it was clear that – and it is necessary to draw that line because I think in attempting to draw that line and to understand where the case of the applicant lies in respect of that line, there may be an answer to this application. Firstly, it was no indication of actual bias.  As I understood my learned friend.  He did not say as a matter of fact you are bias.  He did not doubt that – the applicant does not doubt your integrity.   On the contrary Chair, he insists that the recusal application is brought precisely because he believes you as the Chair has the capacity and the integrity to, here on out, to hear contrary arguments and to come to a fair decision. In other words, you have, on the version of the applicant, the ability to be persuaded by argument by facts put before you notwithstanding what it might be said your views have been, as expressed on the record. Secondly Chair and crucially, it is not being alleged that at the end of the day the Chairperson will not be open to persuasion.  That is not part of the case.   It is not being alleged that you are not open-minded in your approach to the evidence and you may not been persuaded, in good faith, to come to a particular conclusion one or another. In fact, as we understand the argument, that claim has been disavowed.  It was unequivocally stated in my learned friend’s address that there is no allegation that you have pre-judged the matter. On the contrary.  As I understand the address.  You have been reassured that the applicant has no doubt that you are able to be even-handed and impartial in your assessment of the evidence.     No, I am just told you do not have Chair.  I presume that you would have been given.  It looks like everybody else has been given.     Thank you, Chair.  In the first section of those heads of argument we summarise what the contentions of the legal team are in this matter. The first point is that the burden rests on the applicant to show bias or reasonable apprehension of bias.  It is the law, as my learned friend has conceded, a heavy burden.   Secondly Chair, the test for bias is objective.  It is not what the applicant fears.  It is not what the applicant thinks.  It is what a reasonable observer would reasonable conclude.  Two hurdles to overcome in relation to reasonability.     On the correct text, yes.     So it is a reasonable observer ...[intervenes]      ...making a reasonable conclusion, looking at the correct facts.  It is not based on conjecture, conspiracy theories and the like.  So it is based on correct facts and it is based on reasonable observation and it is based on reasonable conclusions made by that reasonable observer from those facts. Chair, as far as the relationship between the applicant and the Chair is concerned.  Again, it is not entirely clear what the case has but practically speaking, any reliance on that grounds seems to have been disavowed notwithstanding the claim in paragraph 15.1 that you should not have accepted the position as chair. It seems that the applicant has contrived his recordal to the historical, professional and personal relationship between yourself and the applicant.  There is no allegation to link those circumstances to bias.  Nowhere is it said ...[intervenes]      No, Chair I do not intend to go into any detail.     Simply to point out that there is no allegation that links any relationship, professional or personal to any allegation of bias.   There is nothing that says because you know the former President.  Therefore, you will be bias for whatever reasons and the like.  It is just an allegation in the air. Ultimately, Chair the applicant relies on the record of proceedings of the Commission to date  Firstly, he complains about the selection of witnesses and says this shows bias. In oral submissions before you, the allegation seems to have changed somewhat into the order of witnesses because I think, having read the answering papers, it must be conceded that having called 257 witnesses, it could not possible be said that all those witnesses have been called according to a predetermined plan or project Chair. But what is worth noting is that amongst those 257 witnesses that have been called, is the son of the former president, Duduzane Zuma, Ms Dudu Myeni and others who clearly do not fall into the category of witnesses that has been put before you as being a category of witnesses, and we do not admit that for a second Chair. But as we will address you Chair.  The selection of the witnesses in the order because that appears to be the complaint now that they record, is logically explicable by the mandate that you were given. You were told Chair to investigate the allegations called as relevant in the Public Protector’s report.  You were told to use the Public Protector’s report as your starting point and you did that. Having heard those allegations, the scope of the inquiry then, inevitable, widened and very, very early on, in 2018, you approached the former president for a version in respect of the evidence that have begun to be led.  Without explanation, there has been no response to that. Chair, then the applicant relies on the exchanges between yourself and the witnesses during the course of hearings of the Commission and very selective passages are relied on we will deal with some of them. The applicant’s accession reveals two aspects, however.  First, we submit to you that there is a lack of appreciation of the duties of the Chair in an inquisitorial setting.   It is your job Chair, not the job of the legal team, to interrogate witnesses, to put versions to them, to make sure you understand what their version is and to highlight what issues of concern you have, not only for that witness but for other people observing the proceedings who might or might not be implicated.  If you did not do so Chair, you would be failing in your duties as Chair of an inquisitorial proceeding.   Secondly, Chair, the selection of passages shows clearly a misreading or a misunderstanding of the very passages relied on and we will go there to show that.  Ultimately, there is nothing in the record that remotely approaches bias or a reasonable apprehension of bias. Put differently Chair.  If the applicant hears the proceedings or reads the record and conclude that adverse findings might at some future date be date against him, that is no ground for recusal. And then there is no merit in the remaining grounds, some of which were advanced in argument, press statements, matters related to the medical admission and the like and we will deal with matters related to the medical condition and so-called press statements or press conferences which did not happen. Then Chair, the applicant also appears to suggest that you, somehow, been dealt harshly or unfairly because this Commission is insistent on him appearing to testify. Again Chair, it is important for all to understand that this is not an adversarial process such as a criminal trial or a civil trial, where if a party remains silent, the other party wins or the party remains in silent might face a conviction if it is a criminal trial. This is different.  This is a commission of inquiry.  Here the Commission must deal comprehensively with its mandate and its Terms Of Reference as an inquisitorial body.  In short.  Mr Zuma must be heard and his version must be considered.  Why this should constitute bias, we fail to understand Chair.   If one looks at page 83 – paragraph 83, rather Chair, of the answering affidavit.       But if I may follow that?     We accept the fundamental basis of the application ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Chair.    Yes, it will be in the red file at the back.     After the first divider, I would imagine and it is a page red 78 Chair, if that helps.  But it is paragraph 83.  That is how I will refer to both.     Yes, 78 Chair.     Sorry, I am talking about the answering affidavit Chair.     If you bear with me for a moment?     Sorry, if I may just refer you to the answering affidavit.  I gave you the incorrect reference.  My apologies.       What is important Chair about the necessity ...[intervenes]      Page 665 Chair.     Red numbers, 665.     Yes, Chair.  The simple thing ...[intervenes]      ...what has been raised before and you are familiar with the ...[intervenes]      It is not sufficient for the applicant to     Yes. “The question is whether a reasonable, objective and informed person would on the correct facts, apprehend that the judge has or will not bring an impartial mind to bear on the adjudication of the case.  That is a mind open to persuasion by the evidence and the submissions of counsel.” Whatever you say and whatever prima facie views you may held, not the test.  The test is whether, at the end of the day, you are still capable of being persuaded and you have an open mind in that regard. That test is established against the background of the presumption.  We deal with that in paragraph 15, the Irvin and Johnson case, SACCAWU and Irvin and Johnson.   Again, my learned friend relied upon that, the decision     Yes, Chair.  In fact, Chair, if you were a judge in a trial you could adopt that attitude, you could say if in this civil trial the defendant does not want to give evidence as an umpire of the contest that I see playing out before me, I am entitled to decide, you would not in ordinary circumstances be entitled to force a party to give a version before you, I stress in ordinary circumstances. But the approach that you have adopted is not because, with great respect, Chair, you are nice person or you are a fair person, it is because you have to.  In an inquisitorial situation you have to cajole, compel, do whatever you have to, to conclude your mandate because, quite frankly, without all the evidence, the findings that you will make ultimately must be appropriately qualified and if someone is keen to see this Commission work, that person should be knocking at your door persistently to say I have a version, I have facts, I want to put them completely before you and I want to deal with all the evidence of this conspiracy against me.   And with respect to the former President, the impression being placed before you is that he does seek to cooperate.  Well, that is not the history of the facts before you, Chair, and those have been set in the summons application as summarised in paragraph 77 where we are now.  You asked right at the beginning of the proceedings of the Commission in relation to the very first witnesses, Mr Zuma, please give me your written response to the evidence of Ms Mentor and Mr Maseko, you have not got that response.  You have asked again, please can I have that response?  You have not been favoured with a response or an explanation for the failure to give the response. In July of 2019 an undertaking was made that you would receive a response to the areas of interest document.  You were told today that well, there were Covid difficulties and there were difficulties in relation to attorneys being changed. I am afraid, Chair, that explanation has never been proffered before you except today when the former President is facing summons and it is not good enough.     Some last year, shortly after August of 2019, Chair.     There is no reason why that document – not acceptable reason why that document could not have been presented.  It does indicate that there is a reluctance to participate in the Commission other than by way of election not to respond in terms of Section 3.4 and the like.       Regulation 3.4.     Yes Chair, in paragraph 77 we go on to say that Regulation 10[6] directives have been issued, not once, but twice at least, repeatedly issued, no response, no explanation or any failure to respond, and the answer to that conduct Chair may lie in the propositions put to you this morning, that in fact the former President is of the belief that this State Capture Commission is a political project, designed to somehow defeat or prejudiced in a significant way the former President.   That would explain the conduct to date and that  cannot rest comfortably with the notion that full cooperation has been offered which it has not and is being offered and one would hope that perhaps after today full cooperation will be offered and that is not with respect to her being Ms Dudu Myeni approach Chair this Commission needs a full explanation of that approach that says that this is a political conspiracy designed to defeat the former President.   Chair I want to refer to, to two things which indicate  that far from being objective the approach adopted by the former President is itself based on conjecture and bias.  If one looks at the founding affidavit paragraph 41, I do not have the red numbers Chair immediately.     Yes, Chair.      For the record we at page 30.      Chair I suppose to think about that for a moment there may be a situation where there is an issue so separate and discreet from the main issues that the Commission has to deal with that it could be decided for example by a medical expert or by an accountant or by an engineer and then you would rely on that finding but ultimately the responsibility for the findings remains yours but not in this case Chair quite clearly.        I am sorry Chair I was distracted for a moment would you mind repeating.     Chair the furthest one would go in the context of this Commission is that it would perhaps be permissible for you to rely on the opinion of an expert where you feel that you do not have the ability to make the necessary judgement but the decision is to whether to rely on it or not would remain yours.     It does not appear to me that there is any wrong here for a second Chair to deal with all matters relating to Mr Zuma and his family.  Drawing a line between those issues and the remaining issues of the Commission would be impossible.     In fact the central issue in this Commission according to the terms of reference is the issue relating or are the issues relating to Mr Zuma and perhaps his family as well.   And then Chair between you and your replacement who would decide what issues relate to Mr Zuma and his family and what if there is a disagreement who wins as it were it is just simply unworkable one just needs to think through the implications of that proposition to understand that it really is unfortunately and I hesitate to say this because it is an extreme conclusion in many contexts.  It is an all or nothing position where there can be no compromise.  Chair if I may deal with – I see I do have a little time left.     With some of the extracts that were relied upon in the founding affidavit.  Chair if I can take you to the numbering is somewhat problematic at one stage where paragraphs numbers are repeated but if I could take you to paragraph 53.2 on page 32.     The founding affidavit Chair page 32 of the founding affidavit.      Yes Chair, I am not referring to the red numbers I am referring to the page numbers it is at page 26.        Okay Chair.     No paragraph 53.2.      Yes, Chair again the numbering is confusing because it was a repeat.      Sorry 26.     I hesitate to say I have been misled it is my responsibility.  It is red number page 37.      Do you have it Chair?     Yes, Chair below the extract is dealing with an exchange between yourself and Ms Hogan and in the second paragraph when dealing with her     Yes I will mention both it is red number 50 paginated or typed number 45 that is the answering affidavit numbers paragraph 53.9.     Now if there is any preconceived ideas it is expressed in this paragraph and it is a preconceived notion about your role Chair and your vision    Chair, there’s another example that’s been brought to my attention by a member of the legal team.  When you said, in relation to the evidence that was led in the Transnet stream, where you said on day 285 at page 209 of the record, “I’m sorry Mr Myburgh please don’t forget your point that you want to ask, I just want to mention one thing arising from what I said to Mr Mkwanazi.  You see Mr Mkwanazi is going back to what I said last time, I said Mr Zuma has denied Ms Hoggin’s version and that he said his only choice for the position of Group CEO is Mr Gama.  I don’t know what finding I will make in the end but if Ms Hoggin’s version is true, then it seems that there may be room for someone to say Mr Zuma would have been quite disappointed in the fact that Mr Gama was dismissed and had been dismissed because that ruled him out of the running for the position of Group CEO and it may well be that a new Minister had a discussion with him and that he might have mentioned that there was this issue of Mr Gama and he needs to look at it.  He might not have said, he should be reinstated but he might have said, he should look into it, and maybe that is why he instructed you to review it”,  An innocent version, again,  it strikes you during the course of the evidence that there may another explanation other than that, that the witness is contending for.  It doesn’t have to be your view, you raise it, and you ask questions about it as you must, with respect, Chair, as an inquisitor.  Then Chair, finally if I may say something about Commissions and the role of a Commission of Inquiry.   Chair this Commission doesn’t give a judgement which will be a final judgement for or against any person, including the former President. Judges sitting in Commissions are instruments of the Executive branch of Government, they must establish a factual matrix on a particular topic, and they must make recommendations on the basis of facts so found.  Neither the findings of fact nor the recommendations bind anybody, least of all the applicant for recusal whose better remedy, it is suggested, Chair, is a review of the findings made against him.  Chair, there is nothing in the papers and there’s nothing with respect to my learned friend in his argument, other than a plea to reconstitute or reorganise the manner in which the former President testifies before the Commission.  It’s a plea at misericordia that passes the legal test for recusal and Chair, in that circumstance, you have no discretion even if you wished to out of deference for the former President you must – you cannot recuse yourself, thank you.    I think the numbers are on Mr Sikhakhane's side. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Good morning Chair.      Thank you for your time.  Mr Msepe, Mr Sikhakhane and Mr Masugu and I are briefed by Mabusa Attorneys to appear on behalf of President Zuma who is the application in the recusal application.    Chairperson thank you for your opening statement.    I would like to get a couple of things of the way.    Partly because…    Thank you Chair we will – we will look at it.    You make a good point in the    You contextualise it.    And of course we know that in recusal application there is something called a waiver.  It means you give even raise it at the beginning.    And so although we are going to look at your statement and I am not going to cross-examine you about it. Chair I think I should get a couple of things out of the way.    Because this matter has been talked about a lot of people have pontificated about what it is we doing.  And I thought this opportunity I must use first to say contrary to public speculation we advised and brought Mr Zuma here to demonstrate to you that he was never going to defy you because he understands the nature of your job and respects the summons that you issued and he was never going to defy that even if we told him to defy you. Secondly Chair since the letter of 28 September  which indicated that we would this application so much as I said has been said out there and most of it has been an attempt to deal with the subject that even scholars – legal scholars tell you how difficult it is.  Because it is not an open and shut case.  Recusals are difficult and they are difficult because in order to approach Judges as I do today you first must approach someone you respect which I do and you must tell them that you think they have made errors.  And it is no easy task.  And this subject is difficult because the precedent as I will rely on Safu as you have already mentioned it I have my own difficulties with Safu because I do think one Judge should have recused himself there. But be that as it may I will raise these because they are difficult.  They are not as easy as analysts and journalists have been saying.  Partly because the rules, the precedent are set by the judges themselves judging those who judge them. And so judges create rules of how we should them and they tell us – they remind me of someone who gives you a slap and tells you how to cry.  And so they are difficult for that reason. And I am going to raise today a number of things because first Mr Zuma does not do this lightly we say this.  And unlike many recusal applications which go the integrity of the judge both my team and Mr Zuma would never come here to say the reason we asking for your recusal or a way to deal with this matter in a particular way as I have deal     No problem at all Chair.     Yes.     Yes, absolutely.     Chair, I will - depending on what the Chair - I have the file of the cases that we look at.  It is the cases that the Chairperson knows but I can share that file.       Yes.     Okay thank you.     So Chair, what I will do is to first summarise those.  That is the first thing.     Having done the intro, I wanted to get those things out of the way.     Because they are important to note and to deal with the principles of the recusal, as they emerge from literature and legal scholars and cases.  And I will tell the Chairperson why I am very reluctant about case law on recusal.   As much as it guides us, it is actually unreliable because     [laughing]     No, Chair you have not.     Chair, you will understand that most people believe that what we must do for my client is to give him orange overalls and walk him to Kgosi Mampuru Prison.  But I am raising this because Chair I am not saying you have said anything of that nature.  I am not suggestion you have pre-judged this matter in any way. I am saying to you, in your comments in his absence, I want you to walk with me and look at whether a reasonable person accused as he is would be – it would be unreasonable of him to feel that the forum seeks to punish him.  Seeks to lynch him.  Seeks to agree with people who have come here to lynch him, basically.   Seeks to agree with the political project to destroy him as a symbol of a particular political narrative in society and therefore, for me, that is the test we must use.   Now in the same case that I have quoted in the Court of Appeal, it accepted that partiality can be described as the inability of the decision-maker or judicial officer to prevent his or her biases and dispositions in conducting the matter from making a decision.  That is not where we are Chair because it is not about the decision and therefore, we are not dealing with whether or not your decision is necessarily changed [speaker not clear].   We submit this.  That this inability that is stated in R v S in the Canadian Court of Appeal, is akin to the South African principle that despite his or her bias or predisposition, the decision-maker or judicial officer must bring an open mind.  So that Chair is an acceptance that all of us in this room are biased including judges.   And the reason people are appointed judges is because they are slightly more honest than we are about their bias.  They have the ability to confront them.   And so what emerges from this case is the fact that what is asked for in a recusal is self-reflection.  And very, very few human beings have that, lawyers, politicians and journalists are the worse. And so, what that principles tells the Chair is that the inclination that it talks about may well be justified outrage.  I am not going to stand here Chair and tell you that you cannot justify to be outraged by some of the things you hear.  You are.   What I am asking you is.  In that outrage, like the judge listening to the rape of a two-year-old.  What are you supposed to do?  Now before I get misinterpreted as conflating court in this forum.  Chair, it does not matter what forum it is.   I understand fully that you have a difficult task here than you have in your court.  In your courts you must make a decision based on what is in front of you.  Commissions of inquiries are difficult because they turn a judge, who is supposed to coldly look at the facts and make a findings, they turn you into an investigator. So they are both adjudicative in some way and inquisitorial and in a way you have to strike that balance and I appreciate your difficulty but I, honestly, suggest to you through the quotes that I will make Chair, that there have been time when even I sitting watching think – have thought the DCJ has crossed that line.  Not of bias but the line of how to express outrage when you hear it as a presiding officer.   And Chair, the last point is actually made in the SARFU case, so that we bring it closer to home.  Chair I said it earlier about SARFU.  I know it is the final decision that was made and we cannot – it cannot be appealed but we can criticise it because it is a very big subject. In fact, the last author who has produced a book on this subject, as I said Grant Amon.  It is new.  He tells us in his last chapters that this is not open and shut for intellectuals, for true intellectuals.  It is not.   And here is what happened at SARFU.  The Chair said earlier that - and correctly read the statement because that principle comes from it.  Now of course, the principle they say, is this.  They say at the beginning at paragraph 35 of     Absolutely.  And Chair, I am going to raise this point again about justice and what we need here and I am going to quite a theorist, a political theorist and a lawyer.  I have been quoting judges.  Rosanna(?) [speaker not clear] says something about a right of freedom of expression, exercised by journalist and everybody.  At the end of writing about freedom of expression, [speaker not     But I am not going to ask you to     And, Chair, I say this because many of us would argue that a slight comment by a judge – I mean, many of us have faced more cantankerous judges in this country and you are not one of them and we know they make comments about people but let me give this example. If you went on Rule 43 application in spousal dispute about maintenance and you sit there as a mother asking for maintenance and the judge flippantly said you know, you women are gold diggers, of course that comment, Chair, does not mean the judge will decide in a particular way, he can say no, I was just making comment. but I want you to put yourself in the shoes of that women with kids, who is asking for maintenance for survival, hearing a judge say, you know, you guys are just gold diggers.  That comment, even if it comes from a – let us call it a flippant place, it was a – you misspoke, the fact that you misspoke does not  reduce the effect of your misspeaking to the litigant who is facing a barrage of situations. And so, Chair, I will not go to the test for actual bias because I do not have to meet that test.  Chair, I want to take you – and the other cases, as I said, is the Tshabalala case, I would like the Chair to look at that, the other case that the Chair has already mentioned is the SARFU case.   Chair, may I suggest as well because I am not being disrespectful to judges and their judgments, is that literature by legal scholars, who are not judges trying to defend themselves, it is much more important here and I can share with the Chair some of the literature that comes from someone who is not a judge, who is a scholar, who is not trying to defend the club, the class called judges because they are much more objective in the tests.  The last chapter of that book called Judicial Recusal by Grant Hammond has a whole reading about how to – what route to be taken because it recognises that this matter has not been debated as thoroughly as it should be because the leaders of the debate are the subjects of the attacks. And, Chair, so what have you done?  What exactly have you done that has caused us to come here?  What have you said that has made Mr Zuma believe, reasonably, that this forum is not good for him?     As the Chair pleases.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Sure.     Yes, Chair, I appreciate that.     Chair, can I say a parting shot to that?     I would not differ with you on all of that.  The reasons all of you are called Judge, it is because the term means, unlike me and everyone here, you can – being a judge is a centrist position, it requires you not go for those extremes but to seek to strike that balance because sitting quietly and doing nothing, I only have a Zulu word for it uktuba(?) it means you have decided oh, you do not want to me to talk so I will sit quietly and say nothing.  That too is wrong.  All the comments that are made flippantly without self-restraint have the same effect, so a judge who decides to go either extreme may be immature to say because I am questioning your comments, alright, I am going to sit and say nothing.   What is required are comments that seek to understand, to intellectually engage but what we are raising – Chair, let me tell you, Deputy Chief Justice, because it has happened to me.  We go – I go for Mr Zuma to many courts.  Only once, and I have had a lot, I have had a judge doubt my integrity, that I am corrupt because I represent him.  Now those are comments that you do not want because you can be engaged intellectually for the whole day, I do not mind.  What I mind is when a comment crosses that line and I think for a judge too, there is something about being called Judge that is about striking the balance in society about extremes and we make those as examples here not because any malice.      Thank you, Chair.     As the Chair pleases.     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, can I just briefly go to the beginning of when you read your statement?     As Chair acknowledged that maybe I did not know that you were going to turn yourself into a witness.  And secondly – and I want to consider whether – because now you have read a statement in which you have a version about your relationship with him...     I would like to get time to consult with him because as Chair will agree it is possible that the two of you have different versions about that relationship.  But I have no instruction at the moment, I have no time…     I just ask the Chair after today or tomorrow I may have time.     And will tell my learned friend Paul if it is uncontroversial.     Your versions about the two of you.    Your versions are consistent.      Thank you.     Chair, yes, I am not even suggesting that there is something in it.     I do want to just at least for integrity of the process to do that.     Chair, the grounds that we have raised in our affidavit, in Mr Zuma’s affidavit – oh, the other issue, Chair, there is a replying affidavit.     That Prof Mosala filed an affidavit on Saturday.     I am not sure much turns into it but we have answered it, I have given – I want to place it on record, it is unsigned at the moment.      Chair, we do not because it is done this morning and two, quite frankly, this is not one of those cases where we are going to deal with – it may rely on how deal with the principles of Plascon Evans.     That is why I am saying the difficulty of your statement is if my client tells me that your version is not consistent with his.      Yes, Chair.  Chair, you will see that in the affidavit, this process where we deal with the grounds is set out from paragraph 33 of the affidavit.     Chair, what it does without – I do not want to take the Chair - to read it.     Paragraph 33 up to I think paragraph 47.     Without reading that, what that ground says read – or considered together with all the other grounds and the pattern that they form, is that when this Commission started …[intervenes]     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     The page number?  I am looking at paragraph 33 of the affidavit, I am sorry, Chair.     Chair, you will not need to go there.     I am hoping to summarise this,  rather than spend too much time on them is that, Chair, I am raising this first ground because on its own it is a weak ground, on its own, if I were to bring this case to you simply on this ground and I am saying I want you to look at this ground in the context of the other grounds and how this whole thing started and the pattern that it takes.   Chair, Mr Zuma submits that this Commission, when it started, as he has said before, is that it starts - because he is alleged to be at the centre of a crime that is not found in any other statute in South Africa, it is called State Capture.  Of course we all know it is not in POCA, it is not in Criminal Procedure Act, it is a political concept that political opponents have created to deal with misdemeanours of the other political opponents but it does not exist in law.  And of course I know that, Chair, you fetched or two experts from America, the most captured State to come and tell us the dangers of this crime. Now how do we identify witnesses from the position of my client?  This Commission starts with witnesses who aligned themselves with the narrative, with the version that there is something called State Capture and Mr Zuma is responsible for it.   If the Chairperson looks back at the witnesses that were picked by this Commission – and the reasons may well be good, I do not know the reasons - when a State is captured, Chair, suppose – I hope we never get there in this country, when a State is captured, you need a wide range of perspectives about what exactly happened in it.  You do not need to call only Barbara Hogan and Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas, who are proponents of that theory.   If intellectually you want to deal with this subject - because it is not a legal subject, it is purely a political concept.  Our suggestion is that the Commission lined up right at the beginning proponents of this theory called State Capture and I am not suggesting that Mr Zuma should have been called first for his version, I am suggesting that if one really looks at the beginning, the first days of this Commission, we were listening to horror stories of people on the rooftops telling us they are not corrupt, they are angels, there is this thing called state capture, they may be right, but that selection of witnesses by a commission, by this Commission, for a very long time who parrot one version, gives the impression that a decision – no, that their version has been accepted, that there was state capture, has been accepted.   And so that selection on its own, even in the cabinet, if we look at the people who were picked to come to this Commission and spend two days, truly, truly spewing their political theories about their opponents, it was people who are proponents of a particular narrative in the South African body politic and I am not saying they are wrong, I am saying this Commission lined them up in a way that is un-intellectual, that would not have encouraged debate about this difficult subject. And therefore, my client, sitting at home, having been head of state, listening to witnesses most of whom are people who have an axe to grind with him, either because he fired them or he did not intervene in some HR issue they were involved in, truly that selection created an impression that a particular version may have been accepted.   What you will find in those paragraphs is that we cite at paragraph 31.1 up to 35.9 and I do not really want to denigrate those witnesses because they did not select themselves, I hope, is that if you look at them, Chair, the ones are picked and the ones – the star witnesses of this Commission when it started, Mr Pravin Gordhan, Mcebisi Jonas, Nhlanhla Nene, [indistinct] Mahlodi, Vytjie Mentor, Trevor Manuel, Ms Barbara Hogan, Themba Masego and Fikile Mbalula, right?   And I want to be clear, I am not criticising the testimony of those witnesses.  I am saying if one looks at what they had come here to say is a particular narrative about Mr Zuma.   This Commission, the question may be, what could it do because Chair, you were at pains asking people to come and I think you were at pains because you wanted all versions but they were not coming.   But, of course, we know that your Commission could have gone to different people in that cabinet, some of whom have a particular opposing theory on the subject matter.  I do not personally agree intellectually with the two theories you brought from the U.S and I would suggest that their version is not the end of the story about this difficult concept.  So that is the first ground. But, as I said at the beginning, this ground is weak on its own, you will see it when you look at the pattern of other things.  And so the first ground, Chair, was that that selection lined up people that truly had a gripe and an axe to grind with Mr Zuma.     Yes.     Chair, you are taking me to a complaint about you I did not want to raise because it is not here.     In fact, Chair, you know, had I apply to cross-examine Mr Jonas who spoke for two days and it has happened here, I would have been given an hour to deal with someone who speaks for two days.     Insinuating my client.     Yes.     Ja.     Chair, I digress, it was not fair of me to raise that complaint to you because we did not apply.     But the point I was making, Chair, I think it is because you and me are lawyers that you say it does – the order does not matter.  Chair, the order does in environments of this nature where for two years you call people who parrot a particular narrative about people.  It may not apply to you and me as lawyers because we sit here and deal with cases and we – usually we forget about the world of propaganda out there against humans beings but I think when you line up witnesses for 18 months who parrot a particular version in an environment of this nature about somebody, it may have an effect on them but the point I wanted to dispel, Chair, because it is – we have seen letters from Prof Mosala, for instance, and before that.  This notion, it ended at 12 last night and the last statement that Mr Zuma will not come here was issued by some foundation related to one of the witnesses. This issue that Mr Zuma refused to come here, Chair, is with respect false, it is untrue.  What has happened in this – I am saying the Chair is telling a lie, I am saying it is peddled that Mr Zuma – it is in the papers of this Commission, letters to us, asking us, even incompetently, to give guarantees whether he will comply and you can see what that is. Chair, I have been before you with Mr Zuma.  And, Chair, I have not asked him whether I should tell you this, but let me tell you.  In the time since Mr Zuma was here, called in that particular way, he has had two moments of serious illness for which you saw the need that he would meet his doctors and there I say to you, Chair, had you met his doctors, the entire approach to how he is communicated, how he is talked to by your Professor Mosala or somebody else would be different because you would know what he was facing between September last year and now.   The second incident is that Mr Zuma for reasons that probably did become public changed lawyers in the middle of Covid 19.  I only saw him three times since then and when he changed lawyers – and those who are practicing advocates, who are not peddlers of narratives out there know this, when you attorney is fired, you have no brief at that point and for moments – for months of that exchange and the interaction, the handover was difficult because of circumstances of the change of legal representatives and Covid and so it is not true that there has been refusal.   Up to now I can tell this Commission, as I make these bold suggestions, Chair, about how you have run this Commission and things you have said, that Mr Zuma up to ten minutes ago still tells me he believes that this Commission at some point must hear his version and so there are circumstances, Chair, that happened – and I do not want to blame the Commission because we too are to blame as Mr Zuma’s lawyers because there were problems on our side that just made it difficult for us to present things to you.  So I want to dispel that notion.  That is my argument against your assertion.  He did not refuse to take the opportunity.     And then, Chair, having dealt with the part about the selection of witnesses, the next ground you will see, Chair, is also that Mr Zuma came to this Commission, made serious allegations about this Commission factually and what he thinks or what he thought then and still thinks today were problems with this Commission that would have concerned you and he apprehends that those themselves seem to have been ignored, the fact that he came here and raised serious issues about this place, this Commission, being an extension – and I am making no suggestion, Chair, about you and my learned friends, I am saying it is not impossible, Chair, it is not impossible in politics that as we sit here we are all pawns in a very big intelligence game. It is not impossible.   We do not know that because we are lawyers, we do not know that world, the world of smokescreens and I am saying when a witness who is at the centre of what you are investigating appears and says to you, do you know that we are presiding over a project whose outcome is to deal with certain opponents?  And I am not saying that version was necessarily correct.  So a number of those were not taken up with him in the letters that we got.     Yes, Chair.     Thanks, Chair.     Chair, it is the fact that he gave testimony, very serious testimony about what you are presiding over.     And, Chair, he is of the view that that was ignored, disregarded, ridiculed because it does not align itself with the dominant version that was given by the earlier witnesses. Now, Chair, let me move to the comments that you have made.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  Ja, it is difficult because we are both in a precarious position of having to give – but let me risk it.  Chair, I said in this Commission that there are times when I personally feel the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing and I think, Chair, there is a way you and this Commission can assure him that you are investigating the claims – your investigators are investigating the claims that he made about how we are here, that this is the grave to bury him.  I am not saying that is necessarily true but that is the allegation he makes and I am saying, Chair, I challenge you and this Commission and its investigators who sit behind it whether they have gone as gung-ho as they have on the claims made by the earlier witnesses that I referred to and the claims he made and it is this Commission that can inform me that the claims that he made are being investigated and if that is done, as the Chair did about his presentation, I will be the first to say that ground is not good.     Chair, I assure you, I assure you as I did now, that this is not brought frivolously and also, may I place this for the record?  I think, Chair, you have had a difficult time because people do not cooperate with investigations naturally and, Chair, when we come and make these grounds, these are not sweeping grounds about the fact that in every respect – I think in 90% of this Commission it has done what it can in a very difficult political context.  I do not underestimate that.   The point I am making is this, is that with the witness telling you what he did and with the circumstances I have told you, Chair, and I think, Chair, if you are frank with me, that undertaking, ruling of yours, to meet his doctors, I know you were reluctant but I think, Chair, you missed a golden opportunity yourself, just like we have missed our golden opportunities because I think this belief that he does not want to come here and that all of these delays since September last year were because Mr Zuma is ducking and divings, others are even making attempts at history, that it is Stalingrad, but it is not that, Chair. And so we make that knowing all of those difficulties and, Chair, as I said, I still say today, this Commission has missed the opportunity to get – well, not missed, it is not the right word – the central issues in your terms of reference, it is the Guptas and what is alleged to have happened and must be investigated and the centrality of the head of state then.   Chair, you are going to finish this report with no version from the Guptas, right?  And I understand the legal issue that well, if you do not give me your version I will just to – but, sir, without the version of such people, I appreciate the fact that it weakens the Commission.  Without Mr Zuma giving a version here in an environment that he trusts, the reports may be great, may be good, but it may not assist in going forward and it may open itself up to difficulties that we do not need.  I have raised it with Mr Pretorius that, you know, if we were playing the Stalingrad, everyone thinks Stalingrad means a delay, Stalingrad was the shortest battle, it was just fought strategically, is this.  If you blow us, today, you do not agree with us – as I have said, I have a mountain to climb – what happens?  Do we get Mr Zuma here as a guarantee?  No, no, if we are approached that way, we will just – even if we lose, we will review you, we will go as far as wherever and that is not helpful. If you force me to bring him here without the climate being created for him to believe that he is not being charged.   Well, I put him there, Chair, and he will exercise his right to nothing and I think those two things as strategic as they may be for me as a lawyer to get my client out of this place I think the country deserves the climate that can interrogate the subject matter without judging the people we already dislike, and I think those – that is the pattern I am giving without judging you, it is a pattern that I am giving not just to you, because you have investigators, you have evidence leaders who have their particular styles and prejudices and beliefs, and I am suggesting that there is a way to protect a process like this, because it is big, and so when Mr Zuma raises these issues about your comments some of your comments look mild in a situation where the person is not an accused, but I am going to take you to your comment when Barbara Hogan was here, Ms Barbara Hogan for instance.    We set it out there in the paragraphs that are – but eventually at some point you said this to Ms Hogan, we have this ...[intervenes]      Ja, your comments.  Just your comments in general and the pattern of your comments and what apprehension they may raise.     It is paragraph 53.2 for affidavits.     It is 53 of the affidavit, point 2.     So I am going to read it for you.     I am going to read the particular comment not the whole excerpt.     With Ms Hogan having said this to     No not on the part, we can deal with that.     No Chair, I think you are correct, I think Chair these are not open and shut questions, but that is the danger of a presiding officer putting a proposition rather than – I will never fault Mr Pretorius for putting a proposition.   You are a very powerful man sitting there Chair and when you put a proposition to witnesses once they assume, especially if it is a proposition once they assume that the Chair is with me here it is one of those things you can leave to the evidence leader, because that witness will latch on what they think is your proposition, is your predisposition and therefore I am not criticising Chair that as a blanket issue your comments are bad, I am saying these comments that are put as propositions open themselves to the risk of witnesses who come here to take chances sent by as political missiles of others are offshoots of a particular agenda, and when they see that you put a proposition about the man they really want to see go down they may latch onto that and think that is the route they want to take because the Chair seems inclined and even if Chair it is not your intention and may I say this one of the difficult things about recusal is also that who are we to know your intentions. One of the things missing intellectually in the debate about recusal is how do we determine that someone can say you know what I am biased, so I did not come here to present expecting that answer to anybody, not because you have no integrity, because human beings have a very low capacity for self-reflection because we don’t see ourselves. So Chair I am saying that comment on its own, not with the background I have given, may look mild.    The next one Chair you say did you get an impression that there might have been private meetings between the President and Mr Marora.  Chair we put that with the others because there again a proposition is put and it is a proposition in the context where this witness of course has come to tell you how bad Mr Zuma is.  None of them, they all have come to tell you that, all of them that they perfect is not, and so when you put that proposition you actually plant in the mind of a witness as Chair what I said an understanding by that witness that a-ha here is the inclination of the chair he thinks this, let me go there, and for a witness who is watching you who is accused about whom they are talking spewing all sorts of things from their moral high ground he sits believing reasonably I think that this is an engagement between you and people who are parroting a version that the Commission finds convenient. And then Chair she says of course exactly what I am saying, she says yes and that impression it is in paragraph, it says something, I forget which paragraph, it is just the example to say I underline that to show to you what political witnesses who come here before you because all of them are due to latch onto a proposition from you that they think is an inclination they have come to give you, and then later Chair you say this to her, of course it is polite, you have to thank her, but we say this because we also have noticed that those witnesses were treated with a certain level of deference about what they say, and then you say this Chair to Ms Hogan right at the end, and I am going to move away from your engagement with her.   Thank you very much Ms Hogan for those words, she had just praised that she appreciates it and thank you all for the remaining of these three days instead of one that was envisage,. All sorts of things.    And then Chair you say this to her, thank you very much Ms Hogan for those words and I don’t think that is our complaint and I think you on behalf of everybody in the Commission who all of whom appreciate your words.  I also, I have no doubt from the interactions that I received from ordinary South Africans every day, whether I am in a mall or in any public space, and many South Africans who happen to have their way of sending messages to me , the messages that I get from them are amazing.  The sentiments that you have expressed about the Commission I can assure you that there are shared by very, very ordinary South Africans.   Of course a very great number of the South African population is Christian and so there are lots of people who say we are praying for you.  Chair it goes on and on.  What is the complaint about this polite engagement.   Is the Chair having the context of your discussion with  her and what seems to be her inclination and your kind of consideration of the approval received from outside the four corners of this room itself appears, I will not use the word improper, appears irrelevant to say to this witness you thank because of the – how you are appreciated when you walk down the mall in all of those, and so read that whole paragraph without taking you Chair, we have underlined it, the point we seek to make, we want to make is that that comment and the others we will refer you to Chair the next one is Mr Gordhan, paragraph 53.6, and we say it was more evident when Mr Gordhan was here, it was obvious that the Chairperson seemed to accept his bona fides and viewed him as a conveyer of universal truth about State Capture, and then Mr Zuma says in the affidavit I do not say this lightly but rely on the transcript which reveals that this disturbing deference to Mr Gordhan in particular where the Chair, the comment of the Chair to     Yes, you do.     Chair I won’t doubt your – but I am saying that is the risk we face.     That I have to present to the very person, the only one who knows his intelligence.     Then Chair you say okay that paragraph appears to me, and you must tell me if you understand it differently, appears to be an acknowledgement by the ruling party that the leadership structure that it had up to that stage were failing to arrest corruption, and these are the practices that are mentioned there, is that your understanding of the paragraph as we? Now this comment is similar to the one I was saying about Ms Hogan where you may – it is a question and I know maybe Chair you say if and you say the prima facie view but the fact of the matter I would like the Chair to read them together with an open mind and see what impression they give and then after at the end you say that now straight about we have no doubt here that which President you meant, unlike the other paragraph, you say ...[intervenes]      I take it from what you say in paragraph 34 last sentence in the event it would appear that he ignored this suggestion, and take that the former President did not articulate his views in regard to the suggestion you made about what processes you were thinking ...[intervenes]      Yes okay Chair let me give – if you go to paragraph 53.6 of the affidavit.     And go down to the comment ...[intervenes]      And there can be no doubt which President you meant here.   You say I take it from what you say in paragraph 34, last sentence, in the event it would appear that he ignored this suggestion, I take it that former President did not articulate his views in regard to the suggestion you made about what process you were thinking should be followed, and then he says – and I am reading both because of what I say witnesses are likely to do when they think you are so inclined.    Well in the event it was ignored I think, well at that stage, and then Mr Nene needs to tell you what followed after the elections.   Chair those two comments that exchange between you and Mr Gordhan of course he as much as you phrase it as a question to him but he sees an opening about your inclination and I am not talking about your intention, he sees an opening in your comment about the President who is not there, and so that comment itself is phrased as proposition that may give – well that does give reasonable apprehension to the person and witness in the position of Mr Zuma.     We do Chair, we do.  I think Chair should be comfortable that we have read and we followed and we watched that interaction, so we are not taking this out of context and as I say I want the Chair to look at them later with an open mind and connect them and say they will be that the Chair, because only Chair knows his intentions.     Will tell me that is not what I intended and I have no way to dispute that.     And then Chair that interaction with him I would like the Chair to go through it, I don’t want to read these excerpts because what I say – what I submit they indicate is a mind that is inclined to agree with a particular witness about another who is not there, and Chair as you keep saying to me correctly, but I need to find out what is going on.     Chair I am asking you to do something very difficult, it is difficult for me, it is difficult for you, is that as I said I am not asking you to go to the extremes, in those comments and those propositions you will find that – because you are human, you will find that in the heat of things and the outrage that you feel about the testimony because you are human there is a line you may cross, and the crossing of that line is not because you are a bad person or you intend punishing people, it is because you are outraged by a particular – and I have seen you outraged in these proceedings, justifiably so sometimes, so I think Chair what I am asking you to do is to look objectively at your comments from the position of someone who is accused number one whether we like it or not in these proceedings. This was started to get him and that is how he sees it, and so his position is important for the Chair to take into account, then take into account those who love him and those who hate him because they are pursuing something else, and then Chair you will see that paragraph 53.7 is another quote where you put your view, expressed as a question you say with the involvement of the presidency right at the bottom, at the foot of the page, of the presidency in the appoint or reappointment of members of boards, SOE’s have been an normal thing, is that a normal thing or not?  Now Chair that question as I said contains what outrages you, sounds like the suggestion that the Presidency would interfere right, because we are talking about accusations that were made before you that Mr Zuma was interfering with Boards of SOE’s, so seen in that context he views this comment and many others as the Chair ’s inclination to agree with these witnesses and that we are disinclined to agree with the counter version because Chair I think there is a counter version in society, there is a counter narrative that makes the entire body politic and this process which is to help policy making must not be determined by the dominant views of what in South Africa is a dominant class and its media and their views, is that if you want to get out of this morass of policy uncertainty, which is what your task is, is our ability to thoroughly interrogate different narratives that are out in society and how they lead to fraud that you are to investigation, corruption and this thing called State Capture.   I keep referring to it as a separate issue Chair, because as a matter of political science all states are captured, all states.  The reason here is a contest between clusters in society even here is that they are contesting to capture the State, some for good reasons, others for bad reasons, so State Capture is a notion that is weaponised comes as a notion that is designed at a time Mr Zuma must go, but what the Chair is tasked to do is to cut the veil, go beyond the different classes that contest the State since its inception is to look at this State as we speak now is captured, this State, particular one, beyond Mr Zuma, long gone and elsewhere in Ukraine but what the Chair must look at is what forces, what do these forces do with the State, what is the fraud, and what is the corruption and I think these comments demonstrate a mind that has accepted a particular version that Mr Zuma facilitated wrongful capture of the State, that – whose intention was to – was ...[intervenes]      Chair I accept that.     No Chair intellectually as a way of engaging people I would accept that you may hear one version and agree with it and then hear another, but here is where I part ways with your answer, it is like Ms Jones Ms Mkhiza was talking about, who is sitting in court listening to a judge talking about the fact that she wants maintenance.  It may well be that when you make a comment that you think she is a gold digger, you will then say to her you may persuade me otherwise, but it is no comfort from a judge to make that comment and say, and give the explanation you are giving me, that no sit comfortably there, I am calling you a gold digger for now but when you come you may well tell me you are not.   That explanation Chair it is sound the explanation you give, but in an environment where you sit in that powerful position with people who sit here, others is heroes and others is accused, those accused persons do not feel that statement you make the way you say it because for them it is not an intellectual engagement, they are being accused. And so I want to Chair, I know it is your explanation but I want you to look at it and see whether a judge can give that answer for commenting flippantly to someone and no but I was still going to change my mind, I don’t think it is a legitimate explanation to a witness.     Both are wrong.     Absolutely.     Chair you have come to the nub, maybe you have expanded without noticing, unfortunately you are no precedent.  Maybe you have created precedent for this nebulas concept, sensitivity, because when we sit where we sit it was not a flippant comment when I said there is something intellectually dishonest about the fact that precedent about this subject matter we get it from people who are the subject of our criticism, they tell us how to criticise them, and so Chair you have come to the nub of what I think reasonable apprehension of bias stems from.  It stems from a need for sensitivity and the need for sensitivity Chair comes from a recognition of the tenets of natural justice and that justice must not be done but they must also be seen to be done, and so a witness may well Chair think of what you say differently if it is said by an evidence leader, so I am saying Chair some of the propositions in your difficult job you are doing have been propositions that a small person sitting – and when I say small people will say Mr Zuma is not small, Chair lawyers we think our environment is easy, because we are here every day, everyone who is not a lawyer is small in an environment like this, intimidating.  It is only nice to those who see their enemies squirm, but to a person who is an ordinary citizen to sit in this room is no ordinary task and so sensitivity I wish you could bring that as an element that really, really pricks, that should guide how we deal with the apprehension of bias, that judges must be sensitive even if they are correct, and all of these things you say here by the way Chair, I am not suggesting they are wrong, I am not suggesting you shouldn’t believe them, but we don’t express everything we believe.  It is the reason we don’t tell our grandmother her cookies are not nice, we just don’t want to hurt them. So sensitivity is an important component of how to deal with small people in a powerful environment with a Judge. Chair all of those codes, because Chair if – I don’t want to – I assume you have read them.     And Chair what I want to do so that I don’t take you through each one of them, I didn’t come here to tell you, you spoke, is that that entire area in which we traverse your comments I invite the Chairperson to look at them the way you have just phrased why there is a need for sensitivity in an environment of this nature. And Chair I want to suggest that we ask you to recuse yourself, mindful of the crisis it would create for this important task, and I said to you we have two reliefs in our notice of motion, the second relief may seem contradictory to the first one because of course we always put this as lawyers further and alternative relief.  Chair it is put more sincerely than we do it as lawyers out there, because we – when I say we I think my client acknowledges this – he takes this stance reluctantly, he takes it because this place, even when he is ill did not seem to believe him, it did not, they wanted to let’s see the doctor and so in a way it may not have been the intention of the Commission, but when you say to someone now you say you are ill I want to check your doctor.    Yes Chair, no let me do this, let me say that I am – I don’t think it will be fair to accuse you of having disbelieved him, I think if that was put in some – I don’t think it is as clear as that, I think Chair it is a series of things in how he is treated when he says he is here.  Mr Zuma won’t be believed even I say he collapsed here, they will say he faked it, and so in a way you are dealing with the a situation where I think that reluctance of yours to do this, as much as it may have been misinterpreted, was that it was clear that saying Mr Zuma isn’t ill does not convince a judge or those in the forum and therefore that offer was made to say you know we don’t know if judges don’t believe when a former head of State says he is ill, when a doctor puts up something to say so, from the State, well they may as well have a meeting but I accept Chair that on its own I wouldn’t like to question that because you did say you were doing it reluctantly and I think you are reluctant – I would like to view as having been in good faith rather than in bad faith, but Chair you will ...[intervenes]      And Chair so all of these comments that I want the Chair to look at, I raised them because I think you have helped me with the case now, that I think a lot of them, my submission is that a lot of the comments you made about which Mr Zuma complain may not be because maliciousness does not fit but may have been insensitive in circumstances of a witness who has come to what he believes is a slaughterhouse, reasonably so by the way. And so Chair I am not raising this lightly, I am raising, I made an example earlier Chair the difficulty of representing Mr Zuma and for him to be believed a judge in this country has questioned my integrity in court for representing a client, it never happens to a white lawyer, but it happens to me and I am saying that on its own creates circumstances for him that he is disbelieved.   I have just told this Commission now that our second remedy, I mean relief demonstrates that this is an act of frustration with the process, but it is no act of defiance of you Chair or this country and its citizens who need to know what it seeks is to correct an environment that I think has been distorted by your comments and sometimes the excitement that I have seen when people cross-examine someone they think is a scum, and I think an environment must be created for you because Chair I don’t care about the people who sit in this commission behind the scenes.  When this Commission is reviewed Chair us who are close to you, who have known you rise as a brother you will be criticised, not them, not the agenda they are pushing behind the scenes, ethnic of racial, it will be you who will be criticised and they will run away and we will have to defend you, and the point I am making is this, I am asking you Chair to look at your comments but the second relief we seek there I am asking you in your thinking about how do we remedy this situation I said to Mr Pretorius I am prepared to sit with him and look at how Mr Zuma can have an environment here where the citizens who deserve his version can hear it and I would like you Chair to creatively together with all of us look at that remedy and see even if you accept that some of your comments may not have been appropriate or may not have been sensitive I am asking you in that second relief to look at creating an environment not just for Mr Zuma maybe for others to come here and feel they are not accused, and that is why I said to Mr Pretorius when lawyers sit and talk about remedy we do that because we want to assist the judge to come to some sort of conclusion that is just and equitable. As I said earlier I can sit down now Chair and you blow me and I will review you and it goes nowhere, it will be the end of Mr Zuma or I bring him here and tell him to sit there and say nothing and that is a stalemate I can do, but it is unconstructive and I want you to look at the second relief and see having considered the things we have said and Chair I would like lastly to look at the statement you made this morning and see whether it is important for me and my client to look at this version, and then we will tell you probably tomorrow or any other time. Chair I thank you for giving me this time, it is a difficult task, probably no one has said to us the second in command in the judiciary, judge you are doing a good job.     Chair in 20 years of practice I haven’t been asked to ask someone I know, I come from the same village with, to recuse themselves, so I thank you for giving us the opportunity and those are our submissions and we are pleased to have discussions.  There is an affidavit we gave Chair to the extent that we take the technical approach about whose version in terms of Plascon Evans should prevail, I will hear Mr – it is there, but I would like some time to look at your statement.     Thank you so much.    Yes Chair.    I thought I had a second chance.    Yes Chair.    Chair I did not think it was my decision but it is fine.  I think Chair it is a difficulty you had when you were asked here about Advocate Soni.  You were exactly in my situation because he did not know whether to ask him to sit down then.    Or wait for him to make a judgement.    Well let me start here.  That is why we have spoken about how this commission was formed.  Is that Chair ordinarily I am surprised that a commission of this nature in this country probably the biggest after the TRC has – only has one person.  That on its own was a political blunder dare I say but this was made by Judges. I think to have one person in a matter that is so vulnerable to contradictions like the one that has arisen should not have been done.  As I said earlier the solution to something like that is that it would – it would really relate to the evidence that – I mean – that relates to Mr Zuma. I do not know what Chair would you do?  But it is competent there is – I cannot be stopped from raising a recusal application simply because you and the President do not know what to do with – let us say you find in my favour.  It is truly something you and the President must look at as to – let us say I am correct on my grounds. But that is why Chair – so I do not know what you would do.  But it does not nullify my grounds if they are good.   We put number 2 there Chair out of – I think it is not mine it is Mr Zuma himself who puts that because he says I do not want to destroy this commission.  Is there no way where this can be done and all of this? So we put number 2 purely out of his own sense of responsibility and I think it solves that problem Chair we can work around how do we make sure that the close to R1 billion paid here for this is not for nothing.   So I think Chair I do not know the answer but what you and the President would do if I am good on my grounds and I do not want to offer the solution. But I think if you looked further in the reliefs we seek you will see that we have not shut the door.  The stalemate I spoke about is a stalemate that I can do for my client.  And it is a stalemate but we do not want to go there. And so I think Chair in crafting your order even if we are right or even if we are wrong I would still plead with you that craft it in a way that does not sink this commission.  That is my answer.    But legally my recusal cannot be incompetent because you and the President do not know what to do if you are wrong and I am right.    I have.    Ja.  Chair     Let me start with the last one that I may review later therefore there is that option.  The reason I would not accept that option not me I am saying it would not be acceptable in a legal process like this is that you making your problem mine in the sense that because there is a conundrum my grounds to come before you must be regarded as incompetence simply to make things convenient for you. I do not think that would be the best way to look at it but it is an option available.  But it does not help because it will not deal with the problem and I have no desire that this commission be collapsed because it is very important. The other thing Chair what you are asking me now is truly what I have been trying to say to Judges to no avail.  There is something wrong with how this thing was established.  It was not thought through.  It was politically motivated in the thinking and the challenges you and me face now are challenges caused by the fact that those who thought about this thought about sinking Mr Zuma and nothing else. And I think if we get those out of the way one of the things to be done for a process like this like we would in a court if we are responsible is to say, maybe in some respects Chair I am correct in my grounds.  And maybe in some respects I am not so correct.  Could we collapse this commission simply because it is a draw between you and me?  And maybe the – let me call it the third way. Maybe the third way is to look at – because this is not a court you can craft things to save this as we – as we want is what can we do to ensure that Mr Zuma not accounts because it is wrong to say a commission is a place of accountability.  Professors say this out there; they have never been inside a court.   Basically it is not a place of accountability but it is a place of explaining to the investigator that is you and if we create an environment in which and we can talk about this – I can talk to my client.  What is the best way of doing this in such a way that we are responsible in the national interest not thinking politically?  And I think – may I make this – because Chair we never did – we have been accused – I heard you saying we did in five things.    Can I tell you Chair that we were on page 200.    Of the submissions to you when he hit Covid; lawyers were changed.    And the situation but basically we not here to disrupt this place.  We were willing – we can produce 500 pages for you of his perspective but we had to place before you the fact that we believe that in some of your comments and the environment that we think are politically driven not by you but other people.  You create an environment where politics contaminates a legal process.   And so if there is a way of doing – and you will craft it you are good at this – you are better than me at this – at crafting what alternative just and equitable way forward can be created that Mr Zuma can cope with if he is right on his grounds.   Of course if he is wrong on his grounds he will blow us.  So I think that relief be Chair tries to deal with this problem that was always going to arise when a commission is created for the purposes it was created.  And so I put it here to this commission that it is a discussion I have raised it with Mr Pretorius; I have raised a bit with you on remedy that let us look – none of us are perfect in this process and so let us – if we look at it that way there may be possibility of creating an environment in which submissions can be made if you heed that. But if I am right on my grounds on all of my grounds    But Chair.    Relief number 2 is truly –     But it is not because the first one is incompetent.    And it cannot be incompetent because you are – you have a conundrum.  There has got to be another reason why the relief is incompetent rather than to say I do know what to do?    Thank you Chair.    Chair thank you yes.    Two discussions will happen Chair as I have said I really need to take instructions about your earlier statement.    And all of that.  Probably tomorrow I will know but I will try not to waste any time.    And then there may be a discussion about what relief gets us out of here as lawyers.    Because we here now we do not know what political people were thinking when they created this but we here now we have got to give this process the integrity it deserves without disrupting it.    Thank you Chair.     Chair, I am so sorry.  We do.  Okay.  I will leave a copy for the chair.     Yes, I will leave a copy for the Chair.    Chair, I’m going to be very brief, maybe you want to take hours of a break, so I’ll give you five minutes reply and you go home.    You can take a break for 24 hours.    I won’t.    Paragraph six of the affidavit, we make that point.  He says, nowhere and I think it’s him whose making false allegations and then he says we’re peddling conspiracies, it’s not true.  I have put to you, what is in the mind of my client and what concerns him I have not questioned the legal team about their knowledge, I’ve not questioned them about anything.  I’m putting to you what my client apprehends, and he may differ with me, it’s not because I don’t understand anything.   So, that prejudice offends me and then he says, he says that I have quoted selectively.  Chair that is an accusation of dishonesty on my part, it’s not true, Chair, I could not come here with a whole record. We say, right at the beginning of the affidavit, that we called for you some of the exchanges, I could not burden you with all the exchanges you’ve heard, so I take serious offence to being patronised in this way because I was quoting to you, I could go on and on and we could differ about which ones are good and which ones are not.  So,  my quoting particular ones, was to demonstrate to the Chair in our discussion about what I’d said, were issues of, perhaps lack of sensitivity on the part of the Chair and I could go on and on so I was not quoting them selectively at all there was no dishonesty on my part and Chair, lastly, perhaps this is how Mr Pretorius exposes what sits in his head. He says – and Chair this is not you, you’ve not said this I accept all the arguments you made against me.  He says, sarcastically, “Maybe Zuma has reasonable apprehension that there may be findings against him”, Chair, that is just an insult and unfair because it questions Mr Zuma’s bone fides for no reason, that’s not what he fears, he fears no finding and so this conspiracy itself is a problem.  He has told you, Chair, his fears and he has told you that he does not fear any finding, but he is told by the evidence leader that, that is what he fears.  So, I want to say, Chair, I’ve stated to you – and there’s no point that I make that I’m going to pull back on, those arguments are what they are, I understand the test that he thinks I don’t understand, and Chair, you have the responsibility to assess it, find against us if you must, I can see he wants to take the Stalingrad approach, he does, and let him do it, we’ll see who wins but we must be constructive about this and it’s that attitude, Chair, that I think has made difficult for your Commission, it’s not you mostly, it’s the attitude that, I think, has a particular slant against Mr Zuma and doubting us and I don’t even know what the prejudice is of doubting our bone fides and knowledge, it just offends me, thank you Chair.    Chair, thank you so much, thank you for listening to this difficult application. 
SIKHAKHANE: I am comments Chair, your comments.   Chair, I have very, very few submissions to make.  One is to start by accepting, Chair, as you know in the affidavit when we have no, we have no way to know that the person has authority as you know there’s counter questioning of bone fides here, we accept your bone fides that there’s that authority we have no reason not to and then, Chair, we were doing very well, you and me argued for ten – for three hours, none of us patronised each other, none of us assumed one of us doesn’t know much about something and I take serious exception to being patronised by Mr Pretorius, I don’t know how many times he said, we failed to understand something, it’s not true, I know no less law than he does.  It’s not failure to understand anything, we agree on the test and I have a view about the test, and he has his view and so to say the following things.  He says, for instance, nowhere do we say – and I’m not re-arguing this point, Chair, he says, nowhere they say you won’t bring an impartial mind.  Chair we say that in paragraph six of the affidavit, I’m not re-arguing the point, I’m just saying, for  a man accusing me of making false submissions, that’s false.
