CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.     Okay, okay.    Good morning Mr Mokoena.  Before you proceed, I just want to announce that tomorrow morning when we commence I will address some of theissues that have arisen recently relating to the Commission and some of the witnesses appearing before the Commission.  Thank you.      I am sorry, I missed that.  Whatever you said and the witness responded I did not hear.    Sorry?    Oh, okay I did not hear at all.  I heard that you were saying something and that the witness said something, but I did not hear what you were saying.    Oh.    Do you not want to ask that after she has been sworn in?    You do not want her to say that under oath?    Are you saying you are going to try and avoid getting her to repeat that evidence?      Okay.  You believe you have been of corroboration?    Ja.    Okay alright thank you.      Hang on, hang on Mr Mokoena.  No the witness must be sworn in.  Registrar swear the witness in please before we can proceed or affirmation whatever the witness prefers.      Thank you very much.  You may continue Mr Mokoena.    I am sorry Mr Mokoena.  Have you covered who she works, where she comes from?    Oh okay thank you.    Is that P?    And what page in P?    Sorry Ms Macanda please raise your voice a bit and try and look towards me not him.      Did you say ABSA Group?   Okay.    Thank you.      I am sorry, before she proceeds.  Can I take you back Ms Macanda to the telephone conversation that the DG had with Minister van Rooyen on the morning of the 10th where he put the Minister on speaker phone and introduced you, you remember that?    Ja.  As I understand it, your evidence is that when Mr Fuzile suggested to Minister van Rooyen that the Treasury staff could prepare a statement – a media statement for the Minister's approval, you say the Minister said that there was already a statement.  Is that right?    Yes.  What else transpired in that conversation, if you canremember, what else transpired in that conversation if you can remember?    Yes.  What was the Minister's attitude to that?    Yes.  Is there anything else of importance that the Minister said to Mr Fuzile that you can remember that you can share with us?   Did you form any view about whether the Minister might have certain preconceived ideas about National Treasury based on the conversation?    Yes.  I do not see in your statement something that Mr Fuzile said.  One of the things that Mr Fuzile said the Minister said during that conversation, was that the Minister said to him something along the lines that the National Treasury, or you people, or the National Treasury must – I think, must stop this tendency of issuing statements.  I do not see anything like that in your statement.  Is that because you did not hear it?    Okay thank you.   I am sorry again, and I may have missed this because Mr Mokoena you are now at or beyond paragraph 27.    Sorry?    Oh that is fine, then you may continue, I think I may be aHeadofyou.  Thank you.    I am sorry Mr Mokoena, I may have missed this.  You did get her to confirm the last two sentences of paragraph 24 right?    They are important, you did?    Oh okay.    Okay, but if she did it is fine, I may have missed it but I leave it to you, if you want her to emphasise.  I just ...(intervenes).    And you are quite clear that you witnessed them exchanging their numbers?    Thank you.    I am sorry I did not get that.  What is it that you do not recall?    Okay thank you.    So did you get the impression that Mr Bobat was basically beginning to break the rules that would – that he thought should be followed, youknow, after his arrival?    So what you had already witnessed in regard to him was one, the first time he saw you he told you that from then onwards he would have to approve any media statement that you issued, is that right?    And then he told you to stop the recruitment process as well?    And now he was being told where Advisors to the Minister – whatoffices Advisors to the Ministers use and he was saying he was going to use another one?    Yes.  Thank you.    Okay, but did you say that concludes her evidence?  Okay.  Let me just ask her one or two questions.  Firstly Ms Macanda in case I forget thank youfor coming to the Commission to give evidence about what you know happened and your understanding of what happened.  Secondly, going back to the issue of Mr Van Rooyen introducing the – his Advisor and his Chief of Staff you have already said you have no recollection of him confusing their names or their roles or confusing their roles or their names, is that right?    Yes.  How far were you sitting from or I assume you were all sitting from where the Minister was more or less?    Yes and how – where about was the then DG Mr Fuzile in relation to the Minister?    They were close to each other?    And you were far you say?    Yes and where was the current DG Mr Mogajane in relation to the Minister?    Mr Dondo Mogajane?    Do you think that in the light of the position where you were you may have not heard something that was said or do you think that it was not said?    I am sorry.  Do you think that the position where you were sitting in relation to where the Minister was and where the then DG Mr Fuzile was and the current DG was do you think that distance may have disadvantaged you with the result that you might have missed something that where the Minister said or do you think that you heard everything that was said by the Minister?    Yes.  Okay so you are not in a position to say the confusion had not happened.  You are simply saying you did not hear it and maybe the distance that the position where you were sitting may have affected that.  That is all you are saying?    Yes.  Yes.  No, thank you very much.    Thank you.  From your statement I think one, I got the impression that there is something else that you would like to share with the Commission but which might not have been considered necessary to include at this stage of the hearing.  I just want to assure you that we are interested in hearing whatever else you may have that would help us understand what was happening in terms of other matters and if the Commission's Legal Team has not already taken the statement that covers other matters they will be doing so soon because anything that relates to what we are investigating that you might have information on will be important.So you will be contacted in due course then with a view to either the obtaining of that statement and ultimately you will be – you would be asked to come back.  So but thank you very much for coming and I am sure we will see you again.  Thank you very much.  You are excused.  Thank you.    We will take the short adjournment now and resume at 11   Mr Maleka?    Good morning.    Good morning, Mr Manyi.  Thank you.  Are you ready?    Should he be sworn in now?    Okay.  Registrar please do that.    Thank you.  Yes Mr Maleka?    Mr Manyi, it looks like if you keep yours on there will be no problem – your mic on there will be no problem.   Before that Mr Maleka you say it was transmitted to me on Friday? I do not know anything about that.  I did not receive anything on Friday.  I did not receive anything over the weekend.  I see there is a bundle here.    Which I am seeing for the first time.  I am told by my Registrar that she was only told during Ms Macanda's evidence this morning that I was going to need Exhibit M.    And she then – she made arrangements or arrangements were made for me to use this Exhibit M but we had not brought it.    Well the one that is here is not marked M1 on the spine.    Just to make sure that it is the right thing it is written Secondary Evidence Bundle of Mr Mzwanele Manyi.    You ...(intervenes).    Okay.    This bundle which at pages 1 to 3 thereof reflects according to the index Auditor General Report to Parliament on the financial statements and performance information of Ward 7 Government Communications and Information Systems, the bundle that has got that will be marked Exhibit M for Mary 1.    Thank you.  Is the witness's one already marked?    Okay let me make sure I understand what you are saying.  Mr Maleka was asking you the question whether you are ready for him to ask you any questions on the topics that they have indicated to you and then in your response you said you would like me to give you an opportunity to read, present your statement and then after that he can ask you any questions.  Now let me ask first in regard to whether you are ready to answer any questions that Mr Maleka might put to you on the topics that you have been notified about is your answer that you are ready but you would like that before that happens you be afforded an opportunity to talk to your statement as it were?  You are not going to read everything but to just talk on what you want to present without being asked questions as yet and after that you can be asked questions.  Is that what you are saying?    Well Mr Maleka I do not know if you have any problem with that?    Yes, yes ...(intervenes).   Yes.  Okay Mr Manyi ...(intervenes).    I will allow you to do that.    Is that now of ...(intervenes).    Exhibit M1?    Okay thank you.    Are you comfortable if I ask you about this letter before you proceed?   Or would you want to prefer to proceed and finish first?    You are comfortable?    Okay.  I see that that letter is dated 22 February 2010 am I right?    Oh it is 2011 not 2010?    Was the – was it signed before you assumed duty at GCIS or wasit – did it come after GCIS?    Okay thank you.  Okay you may proceed.    Well, I am sorry, for what it is worth because you in terms of therecord you have mentioned your names as Mzwanele Manyi.    And did not mention any other name.  Shall we confirm that the name that is used there at 230 that refers to you?    I just want to make sure that whoever reads the record knows ...(intervenes).    It is the same as the witness.    That is referred to.    Okay thank you.    Have you got a copy for Mr Maleka?    Okay.    Let me have a look first ...(intervenes).   Then I will get the Registrar to give it to Mr Maleka.    Yes?    Yes?    Okay, one second.  Registrar, give this to Mr Maleka.  Mr Maleka, do you want us to mark it in any way at this stage or maybe later?    Okay.  Okay.    Okay.  All right.  The concern is simply that he has given some evidence about it on record and whoever reads the transcript will not at that stage know where to find it but maybe we might not have an option.    Yes.    Okay, all right.    Yes?    Paginating it yes.  So it will not be a separate exhibit.  It will just be put at the end of the existing bundle Exhibit M1 already.    And then all that will happen is that it will be paginated?    Thank you.  Yes you may continue Mr Manyi.    I thought there was a point you were seeking to make in regard to the article maybe reflecting something different from what she may have told the Commission.  Not really?  That is not your point?   Yes that article would it be an article that she would have written as part of her official duties or would it be an article that she may have just decided to write at a personal level or are you not able to tell?    Yes.    Well you see the reason why I was asking whether she may have written in her personal capacity – official capacity is this.  That is it not possible thatinsofar as she – as long as she was writing in her official capacity as Acting CEO of GCIS she was supposed to reflect the government's position as opposed to her personal view and maybe on another occasion she might have been expressing her personal views.    But you understand the point I am making?    And I am making it as whether there is a possibility namely if I speak as Deputy Chief Justice of the Republic in regard to certain matters at an official occasion I might not include my personal views.  I might speak on the officialposition of the judiciary but maybe if I am speaking on another occasion when for example I might no longer be Deputy Chief Justice it may well be that I might then say well that was the official position that I had to convey because I was speaking in that capacity.No I am no longer a Deputy Chief Justice and if you want my personal view this is my personal view.    Well that is all the more reason why I keep on going back to the question because I thought to the extent that she may be expressing government position that might detract from the force that your point might have had if she said something else at a time when she was required to you know speak her views – speak her views you know under oath and not necessarily government's position or attitude.    You understand?    Okay.    Government position.    It is something else yes.  Okay thank you.    You may proceed.    But how would they know how many able, how many people they were able to reach namely how many members of a family had read a newspaper if they did not know how many newspapers they sold?    So in other words it seems to me that you have got to first know how many newspapers you have sold then before you can then say but how many people do we reach because just because one paper is bought by one person does not mean necessarily that it will be read by that one person only.    Well Mr Maleka are you able to be of assistance to Mr Manyi in regard to slides?    Well, but in terms of assisting him with slides you say you aretechnologically challenged?    For later.    Okay Mr Manyi so that can be dealt with later.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Well before you say, well Mr Maleka you kind of complained that what was intended as a short statement has taken long.  It is fine.  I have asked Mr Manyi some questions.  Let us allow him to complete.  Thank you.    I thought Mr Maleka said that you had sent to them documents that you wanted to use?    Which were included here, but there was the earlier one which does not appear to have been included.  Is that another one that ...(intervenes).    Okay.    231 to 236?    Okay all right.  Yes you may proceed then.    TNA being The New Age?    Yes.    I am sorry Mr Manyi you have just mentioned the total.    Where about is it?  Is it on page 231?    Yes.    Yes.    The amount at the top is the total?    Involving all publications?    Yes okay.    That is 199,132,58, is that right?    Okay I am sorry.  You are looking at the first column.  I am looking at the second one.  Now I know where you are.    Now I know where you are, yes.    That is fine.    And I assume that the reference to 2011/2012 refers to thefinancial year?    Financial year.    Okay thank you.    Before you go to your statement the column if I may call it that where the total appears which you have told me about is at the top and then below that there is another column.  Is that the one where you say – is that the one that you say reflects the breakdown of the various publications?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.   Yes?    Yes.    Yes.    So in terms of that then, Chairperson in the year 2011/2012 SABC was paid R68 889 851.50.  That is how much was paid just to SABC.    Yes.   But is your – is the basis of your comparison correct?  I have not had time to study this.    So I am thinking aloud.  Take for example you say SABC for example got a certain amount which is a big amount but SABC is big and has got different TV channels, has got numerous radio stations, I do not know how many they are but numerous.Now did you do the exercise of for example saying which radio stations for example what did each one of the radio stations receive under SABC?  What did each television channel under SABC receive because you see you are comparing them with New Age.You know as I understand New Age did not have other children.  It wasjust New Age.    So it seems to me assume that we are talking of maybe a broadcasting company maybe competing with SABC one might have said well does it have – did it have as many radio stations?Did it have radio stations and television or was it just you know television?  How many channels?  How many radio stations because the more it has namely radio stations and TV channels then the more you can understand if it gets in terms of revenue from advertisements because then that would go to different ones.    And if for example you were talking about a newspaper you know if you take a newspaper company that has a number of newspapers that it publishes and you look at what it got from GCIS, so let us say it has got five or six or whatever number of newspapers when you look at the revenue but you simply relate the revenue – the size of the revenue to the company and not to each individual newspaper you may well logically easily find that of course the revenue that New Age got is smaller than the revenue that this other newspaper company got because it has got many newspapers.To be fair you probably would need to take one newspaper under that group or that company which has go a lot of newspapers.  Look at one and then look at New Age and say okay let us compare.  What do you say to that?    Yes.    But let us go back to my question.  Let us take average for example.  I understood you to be saying that is not one newspaper or what I wrong?  Average?    Yes?  What they got was R199 million something, is it not?    Just repeat that please.    Oh, okay.  Okay.    Which one did you – which one does City Press fall under?  You mentioned one that ...(intervenes).    Yes.    Does that not have a number of newspapers?   Yes.    So one weekend newspaper?    Yes.    Yes so it is not a number of newspapers under them?  That is what I am trying to look at bearing in mind what I was asking you earlier on.    In terms of comparing.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Do you accept the proposition that or do you have a problem with the proposition that it may be better if one compared a newspaper with a newspaper one – as opposed to one newspaper as opposed to a group ofnewspapers in one company to get a picture of the ratio?    Yes of course the reason why we are where we are that is you and me on this question is because my understanding was that your initial approach ...(intervenes).    Was to simply say look at what Ads24 got for example.  Look at what New Age got.  It is much more smaller therefore blah, blah, blah and maybe I ask you to soon.    Maybe you were still going to say ...(intervenes).    You knew better.    Okay all right thank you.    Mr Maleka may or may not take that further but you may proceed.    What page?    Yes I think I have got it.   Yes.    The document which is marked, which is at page 241 maybe we should not say exhibit whatever because that might confuse the reader of the transcript with other exhibits, but it is at 241 at Exhibit M1 it is written Parliamentary Monitoring Group or PMG, Parliamentary Monitoring Group.    And it says premium content from before 2017 is now available for everyone.  Integrated Financial Management Systems IFMS herein with National Treasury, Public Accounts (SCOPA) 5 June 2018.  Chairperson Mr T Ghodi (APC).  Yes.    Yes.    Well I just wanted to say Mr Manyi it is important that you also get a fair opportunity to put what you want to put before the Commission.    So yes Mr Maleka may have complained about time but if there is something else in this document that you wish to highlight other than one sentence do feel free to do so.    I am sorry Mr Manyi this document is it an auditor's report or what is it?    Okay.    And is PMG, Parliamentary Monitoring Group the name of the auditing company or ...(intervenes).    I just want to make sure ...(intervenes).    We know who the authors of the document is before we proceed.   Okay.    It is a Parliamentary ...(intervenes).    Entity ...(intervenes).    Yes, okay.   Okay.    And what is recorded here would have been recorded by SCOPA.    Okay, all right, thank you.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    So you are saying – are you saying that this is one of the issues that the New Age published for which it might have made it unpopular in certain circles?    What is the page?    Yes?    Yes.    I am sorry Mr Manyi.  I did not look at the time.  It helps when counsel is standing there because then they can tell me it is time for a lunch    It is better to go to lunch?    Okay.  All right.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will    Yes Mr Manyi?    How much more time do you think you might need before you finish?  I just want to have an idea.    Okay.  All right let us hear.    Yes.    Yes no I was not counting.    It is just you on your own.    Is that in the bundle?    Oh.  Okay.   Okay.  Okay.  No that is fine.    Are we done then with the slide?    Okay.    So the report that you are showing me is it the report from which ...(intervenes).    You got that – what page was it?  230?  231?    The funding.  Where the funding ...(intervenes).    Not the funding the revenues for different media.    For the project from Treasury.    That is the report that was ...(intervenes).    That served before SCOPA.    Okay.  All right.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh, you are making that available?    Okay.  But you are not talking to it.  You are just making it available.    Okay I think ...(intervenes).    I think the Legal Team will take it and then in due course they will indicate what is to be made of it.    Thank you.    I am sorry let us go back to what you were talking about just now.    Of course you may be right that if the work is to be done in town and you are based in the township and you have to compete with other competitors who are based in town you might have a certain disadvantage in terms of costs and so on because of you have to travel and so on and so on and other factors, but – and that may well exclude certain black people, but of course to the extent that there may be black businesses if we can call them that for convenience in town then that disadvantage in terms of costs, transport costs for example, would not be there.  There may be others but at least that would not be there, will I be right?    Yes, no, no I understand that is why I was saying there may be other, other disadvantages ...(intervenes).   But at least the one for travelling would not be there if we are talking about black business that is based in town.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes, okay.    No, there is obviously just no doubt that, you know, if you are doing business as a black person and mostly you will not be on the same level in terms of economically with your white counterpart.  At least most of the time.    Yes.    Are you still within Treasury?    Okay.    Liquidated?    In the questions.    Yes?    At the meeting between one or other bank.    Or banks at a meeting that seems to have been Chaired by Minister Zwane.    Yes.    Well not really Mr Manyi.  If you were present in an office or at a room where something was said or was done whether you were there officially or unofficially, whether you had a right to be there or not have a right to be there as long as you witnessed something, you saw something or you heard something beingsaid you can be asked to say what did you see, what did you hear.  What happened while you were present?    So the question of whether you are authorised or not might be another question but simply from the point of view of saying you were present you saw something or you must have seen something, you must have heard something tell us what you heard, tell us what you saw.  That is legitimate.    Okay.    So I am just mentioning that point.    It may be that based on what you are saying maybe I can leave it to Mr Maleka to deal with it if he wants to ask you questions about it but I thought I must just clarify that part yes.    Okay, no thank you.  You are done?    Yes.  Thank you.  Mr Maleka?    Oh, okay.    Is it in the bundle here?  There is a bundle here.    Okay.    What page is it?    Or maybe if they tell me the page ...(intervenes).    Oh, it will still be put in the bundle or it is?    Oh, okay 275?    Okay thank you.   Yes.    Thank you, Mr Manyi.  I understand you are done and Mr Maleka is now free to ask questions.  He has heard you what you have said.    Yes okay.    Well, Mr Manyi it will be helpful if you start by just answering the question.  For example he is asking – Mr Maleka is asking whether as you sit there you accept – whether you accept that in evidence led before this Commission the Guptas – Gupta family has been seriously implicated in corruption so one answer might be no, I do not accept that.Another answer might be yes I accept that but maybe you might want to contextualise your acceptance or your rejection of that proposition.  So I am just mentioning that because if you start when you answer in that way it will make it easyto make progress.You are not prevented from contextualising where it is necessary but it helps if the first response goes to the question.    Okay.  Yes?    Yes?    Yes ...(intervenes).    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes ...(intervenes).    Yes I just wanted to say just bear in mind that Mr Maleka did not say – he did not ask you whether you accept that they are guilty or not.  He simply asked you whether you accept that they are seriously implicated.    Yes.   Thank you.  Mr Maleka?    Mr Maleka I am sorry.  Well for what it is worth Mr Manyi let me mention that if I recall correctly Mr Gordhan like I think a number of people who were at National Treasury at some stage have indicated and I think he also indicated that he has other matters in regard to which he wanted to give evidence, but he was advised by the Commission's Legal Team that that would need to come later because at this stage the Commission is dealing with certain specific terms of reference.  So I just want to mention that he might not be done ...(intervenes).    In terms of things that he wants to cover.    Thank you.    Try the best that you can Mr Manyi to answer the questions directly, but when I say that I am not saying necessarily that you cannot contextualise, but just try your best.    No I understand what you are saying Mr Manyi.  I understand what you are saying, but if we were to answer on the basis of all the erroneous things that the media is going to do we would be here for a very long time.  So what I am saying is I acknowledge that there may be questions where legitimately you might wish to say more than yes or no.  That is accepted but there may be otherswhere maybe the explanation might be too long so let us take it each on its merits.    Yes it is a general thing.    I am not saying say yes or no all the time.  Just exercise your judgment and let us see how it goes.    No, you must feel free if you wish to say something.  You can indicate to me if you want to add more.    The idea is not to have a situation where your evidence is not fairly portrayed.    Or fairly given but it is to strike a balance.   Between taking too long and giving an answer that you are not happy with or it is too short.    Okay, Mr Maleka.    I am sorry.  I just want to make sure I understand that.  Mr Maleka is your question to Mr Manyi this?  That one of the reasons or the reason why he did not like mainstream media is because mainstream media is critical of the state?    You mean the way they reported on state matters?    Okay and the answer Mr Manyi?    Okay.  Okay in other words what you are saying is they were not doing their homework properly?    Thank you.    But are you not Mr Manyi proceeding – Mr Maleka proceeding from the point that it is the criticism that you say he had a problem with whereas he has made it clear that his problem with mainstream media was not the criticism but it was them getting their facts wrong.   Maybe you can clarify Mr Manyi.    Yes.    I am sorry Mr Maleka.  I think I just need to say something to Mr Manyi relating to what he was discussing earlier on for what it is worth.    Mr Manyi you were mentioning at least in part that the mainstream media was getting certain facts or was getting facts wrong or that they were not doing their homework and you said something about what The New Age was doing – how it was getting things.I think I must just mention to you that well The New Age is not thereanymore now as I understand the position but after my appointment as Deputy Chief Justice they asked for an interview with me which I granted and following that interview they published an article in which I had – in regard to which I had lots of complaints.This was raised with them and it was indicated to them that a lot of things that they said in that article had simply not been part of the interview and they were asked – they had indicated the journalist who attended had indicated – promised to send the article before it was published so that I could have a look at it.  It was published without being sent to me for me to have a look at it first and then when I saw it I found that it had a lot of things that were never part of the interview and this was pointed out to them.Fortunately Mr Nathi Ncube of the Office of the Chief Justice was present throughout the interview and had actually recorded everything.    So they refused to correct the article and apologise and they wereinformed that what had been discussed at the interview had been recorded, and that there was a record, so in the light of this would they please correct this.  I think at some stage there was an indication they would correct it or they may have undertaken to, but ultimately they refused, despite the fact that they were told that there was a recording and subsequently I think something was sent to various media to indicate that there was something – there were a lot of things that were incorrect in the article published by the New Age about me arising out of that interview, so for what it’s worth I thought I must just mention that there is that incident that occurred between me and them.    No in fact what was very strange to me was the fact that they didn’t show interest to show can we listen to the recording.  One would have thought that they would say oh you’ve got a recording, let’s listen to it because maybe we’ve got certain things wrong by mistake, they didn’t want to even listen to that, by the refused to withdraw, and apologise and correct.    Yes, no I thought I must just mention that there was that experience for what it’s worth ja, thank you.    Yes.    Well we have to get back to what is relevant but it’s difficult to – for me not to say this, that about two Sundays, maybe three Sundays back, one of the Sunday papers had an article relating to the leaks that have been happening and on the front page it said somebody was being fingered as the culprit for the leaks, and when you read the article well it said it was Mr Nombembe, it interviewed certain people from which it got the information and it seems that from when you read thearticle it was the reason why – the reason given why it was said it was Nombembe was that it was said he was close to Mr Gordhan – Minister Gordhan, and that he wanted Mr Gordhan to help him to get appointed as National Director of Public Prosecutions.  Now you would expected that the – this is I think this was the Sunday Independent, you would have expected that the journalist would check for example what are the requirements for somebody to be the National Director of Public Prosecutions before writing that story.In terms of the relevant Act you must have a legal qualification, you must be able to practice as a lawyer in all the Courts in this country, Mr Nombembe doesn’t have a legal qualification and if I’m not mistaken already by that time there was a shortlist of people who were to be interviewed for the position of National Director of Public Prosecutions so you ask yourself what kind of journalism is that, people come and make an accusation against somebody you have to go to ask the question why are you saying that, why are you accusing him, what’s the basis and if they give you the basis as journalist you expect that the journalist would examine thebasis to see whether it makes sense.Somebody says an Auditor wants to be Head of the NPA, and the journalist doesn’t say but hang on you need to be a lawyer to be Head of the NPA, they don’t say that, they just write the story.  So ja, okay, alright, I think let’s check that.    Well if he was never told about tomorrow Mr Manyi is entitled to think we would finish today depending, but let’s go on and see how far we get.    Well he is saying revenue from Government advertising is so big in any newspaper or at least it was very big in the New Age and he is making the example that even with – is it Tiso Blackstar based on what he knows to be the position, how much they are getting from Government or at least how much they were getting from Government at a certain stage if they were not to get Government advertising for three months even they would collapse, that’s what he is saying.    Yes you may do that?    Yes, okay.    Different departments bring ...(intervenes).     Thank you.    You may put your questions.    I’m sorry Mr Maleka where are you getting the figure for City Press?     At 231?    Ja, oh yes I see it, yes thank you.    Thank you.    Ja, give the context.    Yes.    No, I hear what you are saying Mr Manyi but I think what is happening is that you understood that evidence given by certain witnesses before this Commission in relation to GCIS and revenue you know which TNA got you understood it in a certain way which prompted you to get this information on this page, as to what other people were getting, and I think rightly or wrongly your first stance, as I understand it, was to say look at what TNA was getting, look at what everyone was getting before going into what the differences were.  I think Mr Maleka is starting there to say the basis of your comparison was not right first, and thensaying let’s take one paper and not look at the company, at the Group you know, and then you say City Press, when you look at City Press comparing it with the New Age annual revenue for that period the City Press got much less, and then in response you make the point, and I think the point is a point that you were entitled to make, to say well maybe we have to look at even comparing the New Age with City Press because the New Age was a daily newspaper, Monday to Friday, the City Press is a weekend paper, so – but I’m simply saying that’s where this  whole discussion started from.  You understood evidence given by some witnesses to be projecting a certain image or a certain point, you sought to contradict that by using these figures.  He is now saying but the basis that you used is not right, that’s where the whole thing is at the moment.    Yes I am there.    Yes.    Are you asking him to read it into the record?    Okay, please read the figure into the record Mr Manyi for the Daily Sun.    Yes.    Well Mr Manyi you are entitled to add that kind of explanation to your answer, which you have done, it’s legitimate for you to say I hear what you aresaying but what about this A, B, C, D as you have said.    234 you said?    Yes thank you.    Oh, he did not hear the end of your question, just repeat it.    Thank you.    No, no, you certainly are entitled to ask him questions and he is certainly entitled to answer and to give an explanation if he has an explanation, because the – what you have done now is to look at daily publications …(intervenes).    To say okay with regard to the City Press you say it was a weekly newspaper, let us look at other daily newspapers like which – other newspapers which were daily publications in the same way as the New Age was.    That is where you are.  He has given an answer in regard to TheTimes, he has given an answer in regard to, I think …(intervenes).    And then The Citizen is not too far above that.    247.    Yes.    Ja.  Yes, put it to him.    Do you want to say something about that?    Sorry, I missed that?    Ja, no, no, that may be so Mr Manyi, but the point as I understand it which Mr Maleka is making to you, and allowing you an opportunity to respond to is this, he is saying as The New Age was entering the market the first year it comes in, there are established daily publications – newspapers which had been there for a long time.  He says when you look at the revenue that it made from GCIS, GCIS accepting that GCIS gets money from – it’s a conduit pipe as you said, it is a conduit.  Accepting that he says but look at the amount of revenue, the difference betweenwhat this newcomer was making compared to what established newspapers were making.He says it made in the first year more than R8 million, but newspapers such as The Star made in the same year R97 000.  The Citizen made R247 000, I see The Herold above that made R255 000.  You cannot deny, can you, that the difference is vast?    But let us start from this, do you acknowledge that the difference is vast?    You acknowledge that?    Okay, continue.    Well, that may be so and I am going to allow you to finish, so do not forget the point you wanted to make.  I will let you make the point, but if what you are saying – if I understand what you are saying correctly I must conclude that what you are telling me is all these other newspapers were not doing their homework. Only the New Age was doing its homework, that is why it made – it got such a lot of revenue from government at least in the perception of government?    Is that your approach, and I am asking …(intervenes).    Because I need to make sure that I do not attribute to you something that you do not mean to say.    No, that is fine.  Before we continue can we agree whether we can    Ja, would that be fine?    Okay, thank you.    I am sorry, I did not hear the whole answer?   Yes.    Oh, okay, no that is fine.    Yes, no, what – well that has not been explained to Mr Manyi.  When you nod or shake your head that is not captured for purposes of the record, so I think Mr Maleka simply meant to say it is not enough if you just nod, you must saythe answer.  I think that is what he meant.    Yes, I agree, he did not say that, ja, okay.    Do you want to repeat your question Mr Maleka?    Would you agree that the one thing good with using just figures only, I think you called them cold figures, if you just use…(intervenes).    Yes, if you use just what how many newspapers are sold with the circulation, you know, that has got some objectivity about it in the sense that it does not depend on anyone's opinion, you know.  You can prove or not prove what the readership is and I must say that I am partly I do not know about some of the newspaper things, but you know, the moment you go to the issues of the quality ofmaybe of the articles in the newspaper, you know, then there is a certain level of subjectivity, but if you want to just compare and say look, which one, if you just use figures, then that is very objective.    Sorry?    Yes, explain?    No, no, I understand that.  I understand that.  I am not saying that is wrong.  I am not saying it is wrong.  I am just saying to the extent that we may be dealing here or we may be dealing with a situation where one is looking at why would more adverts from the same source go to that publication and not to that publication to the extent that one is looking at that?If the position were that it was to be accepted that all we should look at is the circulation the advantage of that would be that there is not much subjectivity.  You just look at who has greater publication, but I am not saying that other factors are not important.    Ja.    Yes, no, no, no.    I think you and I are on the same level there, but there is some misunderstanding.  I accept that there may be other factors that – other than the figures that may be important.  All that I was simply saying is, is it not true that maybe some of the factors as to how important they are, what weight should beattached to them might involve some subjectivity compared to things like simply the figures of circulation?  Without saying necessarily – without saying the figures should be the only factor?    Hang on Mr Maleka.  Let him respond.    Yes, I think you make your point and then we move on.    Thank you, you may continue Mr Maleka.  You wanted to say something and I stopped you.    Yes.    You want to put to put that to Mr Manyi?    So you are basically saying that TELMA is really not being used as – is not regarded as something binding?    By GCIS or by other departments?   Okay, alright.  How much time do you think you will need?    Maybe we should start early tomorrow?    Mr Manyi, you may not have had an idea that we might have to go over to tomorrow.  Are you able to come back tomorrow?    Yes, yes, and we can start early like 09   Even 07   We adjourn.
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning DCJ.  The programme for today Chair will be the witness from Treasury Ms Macanda the last of the three Treasury witnesses for present purposes at least.  She will be led by Advocate Mokoena and then Advocate Maleka will question Mr Manyi thereafter.     
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Morning DCJ.    Ms Macanda, unlike Mr Maleka and Mr Fuzile we did consult prior to you having to adduce your evidence today.    Yes.  Mr Chair we are leading the evidence of Ms Macanda, we will avoid any repetition of ...(intervenes).    At all Mr Chair?   You did not hear at all?    We were just confirming that we did consult with one another.    Unlike Mr – unlike ...(intervenes).    No Mr Chair it was just an introductory remark that I have made, conversed to the one ...(intervenes).    She will in time Mr Chair.  Mr Chair the evidence of Ms Macanda when we lead it, we will avoid any repetitions of the evidence that hasbeen led already by the two witnesses from Treasury.  We will use her evidence to simply corroborate and highlight some of the important aspects of the testimony that has already been adduced by the witnesses that were led by Mr Maleka.    Yes Chair.      We believe – but we will put what we believe it is necessary to corroborate and to highlight those aspects that might not have been much more clearer.   And which relates to her.  But we will avoid, you know to repeat the same evidence that is already before you Mr Chair.    Ms Macanda the Commission is currently addressing issues relevant to term of reference 1.8, are you aware?    Yes.      Thank you Mr Chair and in order to assist the Commission to properly ventilate those issues, you did provide a written statement?    Yes.  May I refer you to Exhibit P, P for Phillip.      No it arises from the statement itself Mr Chair.    Now that ...(intervenes).    It is P, P for Phillip.    That document commences from page 22 Ms Macanda and it goes up until page 39.  Are you there?    Is that your statement?    If you turn to page 39, there is a signature, is thatyour signature?    Do you confirm the contents of your statement under oath?    Yes.  Now in paragraph 2 page 23 of your witness statement you neatly captures the term of reference which the Commission it is    Yes.  Could you please share with us your qualifications?    Yes.  Where are you employed currently?    Yes.      When did you leave Treasury – National Treasury?    Then was the first time when you joined National Treasury?    In March 2012, which position did you occupy?    To whom did you report at the time?    In that capacity what were your responsibilities?    Now around March 2015, which position did you occupy within Treasury?    Yes.  Until when did you occupy that position?    Now in that new role what were your responsibilities?    Yes.  Now from page 25 paragraph 6 of your witnessstatement to paragraph 11, you are canvassing a meeting with the General Director at the time Mr Lugisa Fuzile.  You preface that meeting with the dismissal of Mr Nene on the 9th of December 2015.  Could you please in your own words simply take us through those events?    Yes.  Before you proceed any further.  In yourstatement you captures that on paragraph 6.  You say that the markets were going crazy and the Rand had tumbled.  The Stock Exchange was in a mess.  Now before you proceed, I just want to ask to unpack that statement in relation to the events known to you.  What exactly were the indicators that you know you are attributing to the markets going crazy?  Are you able to share with the Chairperson those specifics?    Mr Chair the witness is referring to Exhibit N1 A withparticular reference to page 30 and paragraph 79.      What Mr Gordhan is conveying in that statement, does it accord with your recollection at the time?    Yes.  Mr Gordhan also, for completeness, in order tolink your evidence with him in relation to the Rand having taken a knock.  He states, if you may turn to Exhibit N2.  Mr Chair you do not have to do any gymnastics exercise, we will simply read those relevant passages to the record.  It is Exhibit N2, if you go to page 140, are you there?    Exhibit N2 it is a separate file of Mr Gordhan.  If you go to page 140 you will see the status of the Rand/Dollar exchange as at December 2015.  You do not have to read it on the record, it was read by Mr Gordhan.  When you look at those figures from Wednesday the 9th up until Fridaythe 11th of December 2015, would that also accord to your experience at the time?    Now you may proceed to discuss in detail the meeting which you were dealing with between yourself and the Director General.      That was Minister van Rooyen?    Yes.    Can you explain what does it entail to draft such a statement?    What was the Minister's reaction during the telephone?    Now according to you, was that telephone call, you know, helpful at all in relation to what was happening in the markets at the time?    Yes.  What were you hoping to achieve with the DG when you called the Minister?  What were your expectations?    Now during that period how was the staff moral?    Did the DG, you know, address the staff around the issues that were happening at the time?    Mr Chair that is captured from page 27 paragraph 11 of the witness statement.  Now you go on from page 27 paragraph 12 to deal withthe meeting with Minister van Rooyen and Mr Mohammed Bobat at the Union Building, but you do so first by dealing with how you met with Mr Bobat.  Can you please take us through those events?    Thank you Mr Chair.  You were at the point where you were going to tell the Chair about your first interaction with Mr Bobat at the Union Building.  You may proceed to do so.    Paragraph 12 Mr Chair.    Paragraph 12.    During your telephone call that you related to the Chairperson earlier on, did Minister van Rooyen indicate to you and the DG thathe has already appointed Advisors or that he wanted the DG to assist him in appointing any Advisors?    Alright there is Mr Bobat coming to you now, introducing himself and what happens thereafter?    Did he tell you as to what his role was going to be as an Advisor now that he was giving you instructions no longer to issue any statements?    Now during this interaction between yourself and Mr Bobat where was the DG?    Yes, and then you met with – you had your first interaction with the Minister van Rooyen, can you tell the Chairperson about that interaction or your meeting with him?    Now what was the Minister's reaction to that request?   Now what I fail to understand is the following, during that meeting that you are now relating to the Chairperson, was the Minister aware of the adverse ramifications which resulted flowing from him appointment and the removal of Mr Nene.  I mean that removal of Mr Nene, the ramification to the economy itself, was he able to appreciate those factors at the time?   Was he aware of the fact that the Rand was taking a knock at the time and there was a need for him to release a statement that would calm the market or at least you know, give some assurance of his plans to deal with those severe economic factors.    And you say that despite that – all that, thestatement that he took out from his pocket did not even begin to address those issues?    Now on page 30, from paragraph 22 to 24 of your statement you canvass what you refer to as the bizarre interaction between Mr Bobat and Minister van Rooyen.  Could you please share with us those events?    So the Minister did not have the number of his own Advisor?    Yes, and then what happened?    Now may I link that part of your evidence, if you may refer to page 58, and that is the witness statement of Mr Fuzile.  If you go to paragraph 18 simply to see that this is exactly what you also witnessed, he relate that bizarre situation in different terms when he was told as to the new Minister    So Ms Macanda you also gained that impression at the time when you saw this interaction, that the Minister might not be knowinghis own Advisor Mr Bobat.    Yes, now you also did attend the swearing in ceremony.    Can you tell us about what transpired there?    Yes.    Yes, she testified on those things Mr Chair.    I do not want to lose it Chair, rather we err on the side of caution.  I know that she have done it but turn to page 30.    30, and if you may read paragraph 24 into the records.    And that is what we have canvassed earlier on.    Thank you Chair.  Yes, you were just about to relate the swearing in ceremony events?    Your mic.    Now up until that point the Minister has not as yet been interviewed by journalists?    Proceed.    And what happened to the piece of paper?    What happened to that piece of paper?    May I refer you to page 40, Mr Chair, it is Annexure PM1.  You can also relate it to PM2, can you identify the document on page 40, PM1.    And the purpose of that document.    And the statement on page 41 is the statement which was issued by the Minister at the time when you say that the markets were crazy and that the Rand was tumbling.    And as you have said that having read thestatement it does not even begin to address those fundamental economic concerns at the time?    Now this statement, I take it that at some point it was published in the website?    How was it – how was the reaction locally and internationally about that statement?    Now did you get any other reactions from a journalist after this statement was released?    Yes.  In your statement you deal with Mr Bobat and his – and the manner in which he asserted his power.  You do so by referring to an incident about a fake Twitter account.  Can you please share with us as to what transpired between yourself and Mr Bobat in that regard?    May I refer you to page 42.    42, paragraph – Annexure PM3.    Is that the e-mail that you said you ultimately wrote to Mr Bobat?    And the contents, it is what you have already related to the Chairperson, as to what transpired.    Now can you deal with the meeting of the 11th of December 2015, and before you do that may I premise those – your evidence by asking a few questions in order to place it into its proper context?  That meeting, you said it took place on the 11th of December 2015 am I correct?   And who arranged that meeting?    And do you know who else attended the meeting, from your recollection?    Yes.    And the Deputy Minister at the time, Mr Jonas, was he – did he attend the meeting?    You have recorded this meeting as one of the important meetings that you had to attend and that is the reason you even had to cut short your sick leave to attend that meeting.  Do you know why did the Deputy Minister not attend the meeting?    And you say that – but Mr Jonas was not in that meeting?    Alright, and then what happened during the meeting?    But what did you understand him to mean when he said that, that everything that had to happen must go through the Chief of Staff?    Did he say anything about the role of the DG, as to what is going to happen with the role of the DG if now the two gentlemen are going to be in charge?    Yes, then what happened in the meeting?    Now do you recall if I take you back to the events of that meeting, if I take you back to the events of that meeting do you recall how theMinister introduced both Mr Bobat and Mr Whitley in terms of their titles or their portfolios that they are going to be holding at Treasury from that time?    And in that meeting the Minister did not proceed to deal with the economic situation or to give or outline his plan as to how was he going to address the negative impact on the Rand and other important issues regarding theeconomy?    And had a pen in the book, the book I take it that it was still empty, nothing to record?    You told the Chair earlier on that Mr Bobat was thisperson that was quite aggressive going around issuing instructions and in your statement you relayed an incident whereby he even had to stop a recruitment process, do you recall?    Now at the time when he said you must stop with the recruitment process how far was the process itself?    And despite all that he said that you must stop theprocess?    And then what happened?    Did you discuss this issue with the DG at the time?    And what was his reaction?   Did he interact with – did you know if he did interact with Mr Bobat on this issue?    You continue also in your statement, you know, to deal in the manner in which Mr Bobat was exercising his power and demonstrating that the new sheriff is now in town he do so with relation to an incident pertaining toone official that had to surrender his office.    Now I take it that Treasury as a department had a recruitment policy.  It must have had a communication policy.  It must have had other policies that governed Treasury including in applicable pieces of legislation.  Now where was Mr Bobat deriving his power from as an Advisor?    And all this that you have related to the Chairperson happened within a space of two days?    And Mr Van Rooyen was the Minister of Finance for two days.    For four days?    Chair that concludes the evidence of Ms Macanda and I am told that it is already past the tea adjournment.    Mr Chair, just one question.  Ms Macanda, you said that you are a qualified journalist?    Now at the time when the journalist wanted to know about the qualifications of the Minister did you yourself you know take any initiativeto verify the qualifications of the Minister?    Thank you, Chair. 
MS PHUMZA MACANDA:  Yes we did.    Yes I am aware.    Phumza Macanda.      No I do not.   Yes I do.    So help me God.    Yes I did.   Yes I am.    Yes it is.    Yes that is my signature.    Yes I confirm the contents of the statement.    Yes it is.    I am a journalist by profession, I graduated from RhodesUniversity in 1996.      Okay.  I am a journalist by profession Chair.  I graduated from Rhodes University in 1996 majoring in Journalism and Politics.  I subsequently in 2006 did a certificate in Basic Economics from Wits University.      I am currently employed by ABSA Group Limited.    ABSA Group Limited yes.    I left the National Treasury at the end of August 2016.    I joined Treasury in March 2012.    When I joined Treasury in March 2012, I was the Director of Media Relations and Communications.      I reported to Mr Jabulani Sikhakhane.    My job as the Director of Media Relations and Communications at Treasury was to assist in protecting, maintaining and enhancingthe reputation of the National Treasury.  It was to help build understanding and support for National Treasury Policies.  My job included disseminating information about Treasury activities and to ensure that in as far as the work of the Treasury, the Treasury was the primary source of information.  It was also to make sure that the Treasury messages and narrative were always consistent, were always clear, the kind of the messages that build credibility of the institution.In that capacity, therefore, I worked with journalists.  I was the person who would receive inquiries from journalists, work with the Treasury Officials to craft responses to those questions.  I was the person who was responsible for working with journalists, especially around key calendar events of the Treasury, in particularthe budget, organising the lock-up that you would have and making sure that we get journalists to come to the lock-up and get the documents and understand what we are doing in that regard.My job also included advising Treasury Officials and the Minister of Finance on which communication, platforms and media platforms to use to disseminate information and to ensure that such messages were always in alignment with broader Government messages.    In March 2015 Mr Jabulani Sikhakhane to whom I reported left the employ of the Treasury.  I was then appointed in his position on an acting capacity and therefore I assumed his position as Chief Director of Communications in an acting capacity.    I was in an acting capacity until I was appointedpermanently in October 2015.    Generally my responsibilities were the same, save in the new position, I was part of the Executive Committee of the National Treasury, I was part of senior management.  I was also responsible for the administration of the Communications Unit and everyone who worked in the Communications Unit reported to me.  I also was the spokesperson for that department and the Minister of Finance.    I learned about the firing of Minister Nene late on Wednesday the 9th of December.  I was on sick leave and I learned about his firing quite late on that day.  The next morning when I went into the office, I sought out the Director General of the National Treasury Mr Lugisa Fuzile.  The reason I sought him out was because the market reaction to the axing of Minister Nene was quite negative.  The Stock Exchange was down quite significantly.  The Rand currency had depreciated in a similar manner and my phone was ringing constantly, because journalists wanted to know whether the National Treasury was going to release a statement about the Minister of – about the firing of Minister Nene and what would we say, would we say anything about what it meant.    I think in that regard Chair, I would like to refer to the statement of Minister Gordhan who testified previously, where he outlines the negative market reaction.    Yes.    In his submission Minister Gordhan says that the devastating impact of this unexpected announcement on the South African economy is expected to be approximately R500 billion.  He refers to market analysts who described that over the two days the market value of the country's 17 biggest financial and property shares fell by R290 billion.  The figure excludes the remainder of the equities market that was also hard hit by the decision.  South African Bonds lost 12% of their capital value.  The Rand depreciated sharply from R13.40 to R15.40 overnight.    Yes, yes it does.    Paragraph number, I am afraid not, I do not think I will be able ...(intervenes).    Yes I would say it is correct.    I went into the Director General's office to consult with him about the statement that we both agreed would need to be released and we both understood that such a statement would need the approval of the Minister who was announced the previous night.  The Director General then phoned the Minister in my presence.  He put the Minister on speaker phone and explained to the Minister that I was also on the line and explained to the Minister why I was on the line.      That was Minister van Rooyen.    The Director General proceeded to congratulate the Minister and I will not repeat some of the things that he said, as he has testified tothem.  But part of the conversation that I was particularly interested in was the one that concerned what statement we would release to the public.  The Director General then talked to the Minister about the negative market reaction and explained to the Minister that there was need for the National Treasury to respond.  He offered the services of National Treasury Officials to draft such a statement.I should explain that the process of drafting a statement is a consultative one and one you – it is impossible to do it within an hour.    Yes in this case it would entail – and this is what theDirector General was suggesting to the Minister.  He was suggesting that he was offering the services of the Senior Treasury Officials to draft such a statement which the Minister would then approve and the plan was that shortly after his swearing in, that statement would be released to the public.    The Minister told the DG that there was a statement that was already drafted and that the National Treasury did not need to worry about such a statement.  He said he would provide the statement to the DG later.      No it was not.  It was not for the reason that I have given earlier that preparing a statement is a consultative process and we wanted such a statement to be released shortly after his swearing in ceremony.  But also it was not helpful because we did not know what was in the statement that the Minister had toldus had been prepared.      Our expectations was that the Minister would work with us, the Minister would give us his approval to start drafting a statement, but more importantly that the Minister would give us guidance on what he thinks should be said publically about the developments of the previous night.    We were in shock.  There was almost a sense of mourning within Treasury that morning.  A lot of us did not know what to make senseof the developments and we really were in shock, we were just standing around talking to each other and we were in shock.    We discussed the DG addressing staff and the concern was that it was important for that to happen in the presence of the Minister.  But in the phone call, one of the things that we discussed by the DG and the Minister was the Minister coming to the office and the Minister had indicated that he would not be able to come to the office and that he would meet us at the Union Buildings at the swearing ceremony.So given the shock that the staff was in and we discussed with the DG the idea of going to address staff and we decided that it was a good idea for the DG to address staff.  He then went downstairs and the room was packed to the rafters, everyone wanted to hear what he said.  He made few comments to the staff the essence of which was that, as National Treasury Officials, our main responsibility isto serve the nation.  No matter what the developments of the day were, we should be less concerned about that and more concerned about going back to our desks and doing our job.  He has already testified here about the fact that there was a lot of work that needed to be done on the budget.  He encouraged the staff to go back to their desks and focus on that.  One of the things that he said was that we needed to remember that we serve the administration of the day, whoever that is and we are the link between the administration and the stability of the Department was the most important thing.    Yes I do Chair.    He said there was already a statement that had been prepared and we did not need to worry about that.      I think the DG already referred to his conversation with the Minister in as far as the invitation to come to the office and perhaps meet with Minister Nene who had come to the office that morning and to clear his office.  That was something else that came up in that conversation.    I did not find the Minister's attitude to be that of listening and being welcoming to the request and the invitation that the DG was making.    Not that I recall specifically, no not that I recall.      I certainly did.  As I said, the Minister said to the DG in a manner that I found to be almost dismissive of the DG's suggestions.  I certainly – I came out of the conversation thinking this is going to be an interesting and perhaps half working relationship for all of us.      It is because I do not recall it.    So when I got to the Union Buildings ...(intervenes).    When I got to the Union Buildings I asked the people from the Presidency that were waiting for us, I introduced myself and told them that I was here for Minister van Rooyen.  I had previously been invited the previous night to come to the Union Buildings for the swearing in ceremony, and I asked them where I should go.  They pointed me to a waiting room and told me that Minister van Rooyen would be coming and would be waiting there, and that is the room in which I would meet with him.  While I was standing there waiting for Minister van Rooyen, I noticed the people from the Presidency standing with this tall gentleman of Indian origin, and they pointed towards me.  They pointed towards me.  The gentleman then walked towards me and he informed me that he was the Advisor to the new Minister.  I did not think anything about that and he introduced himself and he told me that his name was Mohamed Bobat.    No I do not – the Minister did not say anything about having appointed Advisors already.  Conversation about Advisors actually did not take place in that conversation with the DG.    I would not say I was specifically aware at this time but I was surprised that the Minister, who was just announced, had already appointed Advisors.   So he came, he introduced himself and he said to me – he asked me what is your job, and I explained to him what my job was, and he says are you the one who releases statements for National Treasury, and I responded in the affirmative.  He then said to me from now on no statement goes out without my approval.  Every statement must be approved by me and the Minister.  I was very puzzled and taken aback by this for two reasons; firstly he was a little aggressive with me.  It was not that there were no pleasantries that were exchanged but his manner was quite aggressive and almost hostile.  It felt to me that it was important for him to assert his authority quite quickly with him, and also I was puzzled before, it just is part of practice and policy that every statement goes out be approved by the Minister and the DG.  So that was not something that needed to be pointed out with me by someone who understands how the system works.  I then said to him yes, yes, you know every statement that goes out isapproved by the Minister, that is how we do things.    He did not explain to me what his role was, that discussion did not come up, but he just told me that he was an Advisor, and I must say as I understood the role of Advisor, I did not understand it to include being part of approving statements, to the extent that they are Advisors to the Minister, they are privy to discussions they were in but certainly not in approving statements.   At this point the DG had not arrived.  We had travelled separately to the Union Buildings, but at some point he did arrive.  So the DG was not witness to this exchange in my – ja in my recollection.    I then stepped into the room that we were told to wait in and I was waiting there, and at some point the Minister did come.  He arrived, and he arrived with his family.  He left his family in the other room and then came to join us in the room, and in the room was myself, the DG, Mr Bobat and of course the Minister.  And once the Minister arrived the DG then once again spoke to the Minister, and he spoke to the Minister about events that had transpired at the Treasury that morning.  He explained to Minister that he addressed staff.  Heexplained to Minister, I summarised for the Minister what it is that he said, and then he once again talked to the Minister about the need for us to be releasing a statement as the Treasury, and explained that that was the reason I was there to assist with that specific task.  And it was the second time that he was doing it because I was bothering him.  Even though I had heard the earlier conversation, I was worried as I say, because the journalists were calling me.  So I understood the importance of this.  So he then explained to the Minister once again about us talking and agreeing about releasing a statement.    The Minister took out a piece of paper and he gave it to the DG.  The DG read the piece of paper, he gave it to me, I read the piece of paper and in essence what the piece of paper was an introduction of the Minister, and generally it just – it was just an introduction to the Minister, and one of the key messages that were in that statement was that he would open up access to the Treasury.  After reading the statement I felt that the statement lacked in the key messages that we needed to have in a statement that the DG had already explained to the Minister.  Key messages for instance that would talk about policy trajectory, policy stability and the importance of the Treasury sticking to the fiscal targets and sticking to all of those policy that have been announced.  This was the main thing that people were asking, what does this appointment mean for policy.  Does it mean that – does it signal a change in policy?  I then said to the Minister, at that point the DG was – it almost – it felt to me that he was in that meeting but he was not there, because the interaction with the Minister did not yield fruit but also it was very difficult.  So I explained to the Minister that the statement was agood start.  I then offered to enhance it with the messaging that we use in the Treasury.  I brought with me some of the documents that were previously published to assist in that regard.  The Minister was non committal, he would not give his approval for me to enhance the statement with the kind of messages that we had discussed with him.    I cannot speak to his state of mind but I can say that that was explained to him twice by the DG, first in the telephone conversation that took place that morning and secondly while we were sitting there.    That is exactly what the DG was explaining to him.  He was explaining about the negative market reaction on the Stock Exchange and in the currency market and in the bond market.  He was explaining to him about the fact that we needed to assure the market.  We needed to assure the market that the appointment was not a signal for policy change, and he was explaining to the Minister all of these things while he was explaining why we needed to release a statement.    No it did not.    So at some point during the meeting once we had moved from discussing the statement and not getting the approval that we were hoping for from the Minister, Mr Bobat said to the Minister I called you, why did you not return my call, and his tone was the same authoritative one that he hadused with me.  It lacked the hostility that he had shown towards me earlier but it certainly was contemptuous, I thought it was contemptuous.  The Minister then said oh, I have been getting a lot of phone calls from people congratulating me, and the thing is I do not have your number so I could not return your call.    That is what the Minister said, I do not have your number so I could not return your call.    I was flabbergasted to say the least, I quite was shocked because I was thinking to myself firstly I was shocked by this manner towards the Minister, as I say he was quite contemptuous and he was quite dismissive, but also one thing that I thought about was if he does not have the number then do these people know each other, and if they do not know each other how does he become the Minister's Advisor.   I certainly was left with the impression that they did not know each other and if they did, they did not know each other very well.    Yes I did.    So the ceremony took place ...(intervenes).    Okay.    “What I was thinking was these people do not know each other.  If they do not know each other how does MrBobat becomes Minister's Advisor.  I then witnessed Mr Bobat and the Minister exchanging phone numbers in our presence.  I was left with the impression that they did not know each other.”    Yes.    So ...(intervenes).    So at some point the swearing in ceremony started.  The Minister went into a different entrance, I went into the entrance and sat with the journalists and the journalists were eager to interview the Minister.  They hadbeen asking me whether the Minister would grant interviews after his swearing in ceremony.  I had also explained this to the Minister, that I was getting a lot of requests for interviews, and he explained to me that he would not be doing interviews at ...(intervenes).    No, no.    The swearing in ceremony went ahead, and after it was – the Minister, I should point out the Minister took out the piece of paper thathe had given to myself and the DG to read.  He took out the piece of paper.  He read from the piece of paper after he was sworn in and after the swearing in ceremony I followed the Minister and the President as they were leaving in a different entrance.  He gave me the piece of paper because I needed to take it back to the office and type it up so that we can release the statement.    I am sorry?    I do not know.  Once I typed the statement I probably disposed of it but I typed up the statement because I did not have an electronic copy so I needed the hard copy.    Yes.   So in page 41 it is a copy of the statement that I typed up, that I then consulted with Mr Bobat as had been previously directed to, for the approval of the statement.  In page 40 it is an e-mail I sent to Mr Bobat with the attachment of the statement, asking him to approve.    Yes it is.    No, the statement did not address the concerns.    Yes the statement was published on the website once approved by Mr Bobat.    The statement was benign in as far addressing some of the concerns that had already been raised and it – the reaction to it was really – in fact some people were quite angry, and I recall receiving a phone call from one London based analyst, his name is Peter Attard Montalto, at the time he worked for Nomura International, and Peter said to me what the hell kind of statement is this, what are you guys saying here.  And I explained to Mr Montalto that my jobwas to communicate on behalf of the Minister of Finance and this statement was the communication from the Minister of Finance.  He really expressed frustration and he said you guys are not saying anything there.  And you know he then hung up on me.    I got a lot of reaction from journalists in terms of continuing to ask for interviews with the Minister, one of whom was CNN, Eleni Jeokos, she sent me e-mail and she was phoning me constantly because she was saying you know we need to talk to the Minister, we need to talk to the Minister. But certainly not the kind of reaction where people were calmer after we released the statement because it addressed some of the concerns.    So by the time that the Minister was sworn in there was already a fake Twitter account that was created in his name.  It was not our first experience with fake Twitter accounts.  We had previously had such with Minister Nene, with the Deputy Minister of Finance Mr Mcebisi Jonas and these fake Twitter accounts generally were used by people that wanted to swindle people out of their money.  So what we would normally do as the Treasury, we would release an Advisory to the public, saying this is a fake Twitter account, please be cautious and make sure that you are not taken in by the scams.  So late on the evening of the 10th I got a phone call from Mr Bobat and he was demandingthat I deal with the Twitter account of the Minister, and he said to me I want you to close the account and I want you to write a report for me in the morning.  I want a report from you in the morning.  Once again I found his tone to be very aggressive, and I explained to Mr Bobat that to be able to close an account one would need to have the administrative login details of the account, which we did not have because we did not create the account.  And I explained to him that we would not be able to close the account.  The least that we can do is to alert the public to the fact that the account was fake.  And you know he was abusive, I felt, and intimidating.  And I wrote him an e-mail that evening and I explained to him what I would do in the morning and I explained to him also that I was on sick leaveand I would not be coming into the office.    42?    Yes.    Yes, this is the e-mail I wrote to Mr Bobat.    Yes, yes, they are.    Yes, the morning after.  The morning after.  It was a Friday.    I received a call that morning from Mr Marlon Geswint, who was the Chief of Staff of Minister Nene.  I was not planning to come to the office.  So I imagine Marlon arranged the meeting.    So my recollection, Momo was there, Mr Ismail Momoniat, who is the Head of Tax and Tax Policy at the NationalTreasury.  I do recall Ms Kay Brown, who was in the meeting.  She was acting on behalf of Mr Michael Sachs, who was the Head of the Budget Office.  Mr Sachs was already on leave.  I do recall Mr Monale Ratsoma being in the meeting and there was list that was provided with people that were in the meeting.  But in my recollection I do not recall everyone there.    But these were the people that were in the meeting.    No, that was strange; he was not in the meeting.    So I debated with myself about going to the office toattend the meeting but I felt that I could not be absent in a meeting, the very first meeting that the Minister of Finance has with senior Treasury Officials.  So out of respect for the Minister I went to the office.  I asked my brother to drive me to the office and I went to the office, and the reason why I felt the meeting as important was because I thought that the Minister was going to talk to us about what was important in his agenda.  I thought he was going to talk to us about some of the budget processes, things that still needed to be concluded so we would be able to table the budget in February.  I thought the Minister was going to talk to us about what his agenda was going to focus on in the short term, things that we need to know.  So I went to the meeting with a pen and paper to take notes so that I get tounderstand what was important to the Minister.    No, the Minister came in and the Deputy Minister was not there, and I found that to be very strange.  In fact I did not know whether the Deputy Minister was in the office or not.  I had not seen him that morning before I went into the meeting.    So the meeting started, started a little bit late and the Minister came in with two gentlemen, one of whom I recognised, I had previously been introduced to him the previous day, Mr Bobat.  He came into the meeting with Mr Bobat and another gentleman I did not recognise, and he then introduced the two gentlemen, and he introduced Mr Ian Whitley as his Chief of Staff and Mr Mohamed Bobat as his Advisor.  The Minister said that – he informed themeeting that whatever needed to come to his office, had to go through his Advisor and his Chief of Staff.    The Minister did say that everything that we did had to be done with the approval of the two gentlemen.  So what I understood him to mean was the introduction was important because these were the people that we would need to work with.  These were the people that almost were in charge so we needed to know who they were.   Not at that point, no.    So after the Minster introduced the two gentlemen he then, you know, sat back and was looking at Mr Bobat as if to hand over the meeting to Mr Bobat at which point the DG said "okay now wait a minute, hold on" and then the DG said "I think it is important that I introduce the people that I am with."  The manner of the DG was quite angry I thought and this was surprising to me because he is a very even tempered man.  I got to know him as a very sober and even tempered person, but in that meeting he was quite angry.  In fact he was pointing his fingers at, towards the Minister and his Advisor.He then went around the room introducing each and every person that was in the meeting and explaining what their role in the Treasury was and then he said, hepointed his finger and said "here we do everything by the book.  If I say to you no it is not going to be done it is not because I do not like your face it is because it is not right by regulations.  If it is not according to the book, (and the book that he was referring to was the Minister's handbook), he said if it not according to the book it is not going to be done."  I found that exchange to be puzzling as I say because I did not think there was something that had happened in this meeting that explained his angry reaction.  So I surmised that it was almost as if I was witnessing act two of a play without having seen act one because he was angry.    I do not have a specific recollection of this and I am aware that the other witnesses have testified to the Minister confusing the names.  I have wracked my brain trying to recall that memory.  I do not have a recollection of that.    I am saying that, I am sorry, I am saying that I am aware that other witnesses have testified that during the introduction the Minister confused the names of the Advisors.  That is not something specifically that I have a recollection of.    No not at all.  Once he had done with his introductions he was done and he was signalling, handing over the Minister to Mr Bobat and it almost seems that that was the conclusion of the meeting at which point the Minister said "no, no just hold on."    I had nothing to record.  I had no notes to take because nothing of substance was discussed in the meeting.    Yes.  So after this meeting ended, the one that we had with the Minister Mr Bobat had previously told me that he wanted to meet with me and he said to me he wanted to discuss the Communications Unit and I took with me the organogram of the Communications Unit and a few documents and I was explaining to him the structure of the Communications Unit.  My appointment as Chief Director of Communications in October had occasioned a vacancy for the position that I previously held.  So I was explaining these things to Mr Bobat and I was explaining to him that we had just started with the recruitment process for the Director of Media Relations and Communications at which point he said to me "no, no, no you need to stop that, you need to stop that" and I said to him "why" and he said "we do not need to worry about that recruitment process."  I explained to Mr Bobat that, you know, he was having a conversation with the wrong person in thisbecause he needed to have this conversation with the Director General of the National Treasury and the Deputy Director General who was responsible for Corporate Services.  They would be people that could – that he could discuss it with.    I was appointed in October.  So we had already advertised and I think at this point we had closed the advertisements and we had received CV's.  So the next step in the process would be for me to go through the CV's and do a shortlist.  So that is the state at which we were.    He said, he said "no you need to stop that."    Well I mean as I say I explained to him that I was not authorised to make that decision.  That authority rested with the DG of National Treasury, but I also found the meeting very unusual, because my understanding of his role as Advisor did not include him being involved in the processes of the department certainly not the HR processes of the department.  So I was quite taken aback by what I thought was audacity on his part to be talking to me about what – how we should be running the HR process and once I explained to him that he needed to discuss the matter with the DG that was the close of – that was the end of the discussion.    I certainly did.    He was angry.  He was very angry.    I do not know if he interacted with Bobat on that issue.  I did not spend a lot of time on the second floor which is where the DG's office and the Minister's office were.  I spent most of my time in my office.  So I was only there for meetings.  So if there were any interactions I did not see them.    Yes.  So I had to go up to the Minister's office because one of the things that we were being asked was a full CV of the Minister.  We had posted a very short CV of the Minister that included his qualifications and that included his work experience and I was getting a lot of calls from people about Minister was the Mayor of Merafong and a lot of journalists wanted to know when and for how long was he mayor and also people wanted to know the qualifications that he had listed, in which years were those qualifications obtained and from which institutions.  So I was in the Minister discussing this and the Minister asked me "you know why are people interested in my CV" and I had to explain to the Minister why a CV of a Minister of Finance is important and I explained to him that someone in that role is entrusted with a lot of powers and because of that people want to know what his experiences are, what his policy views are and trust in the office of the Minister of Finance equals trust in government.  So the Minister took the CV and said okay I should wait outside of his office while he was going to fill in some of the blanks I hadhighlighted.  While I was waiting outside the Minister's office I witnessed Mr Bobat ordering Mr Marlon Geswint to vacate his office and he was saying to Marlon "you need to leave, this is where I am going to sit" and Marlon was explaining to him that no this office is the office for the Chief of Staff and the Advisors sit on the other side and it is quite a distance to go to where the Advisors sit and Mr Bobat was saying "I need you out of this office right now and this is where I am going to sit" and he was also explaining that everyone needed to move because he needed to be situated as close to the Minister as possible.    I certainly got that impression Chair.  I mean in my interaction with him I got the sense that he was ignorant of the rules, but he also was not interested in what the rules were, but even if the rules were there he would disregard them and he would make new rules, because I had explained to him when he was talking to me about stopping the recruitment process I explained to him that I was not authorised to do that, but it was – that was not important he was not interested.    Yes he did.    Yes he did.    Yes he was telling people to move so that he can sit as close to the Minister's office as possible.    I do not know.  I do not know where Mr Bobat derived hispower from, but as I have previously testified in the two minutes – in the first two minutes that I met with him he made it very clear that he had authority.  Where he derived it from I do not know.    It happened in a space of – yes inside of 24 hours.    He was the Minister for four days.    Yes.    That is right I do not have a specific recollection of that.    I was quite at the end of the table.  So the table is big and round.  The Minister and his two gentlemen were at the Head of the table andthe DG was next to them.  I was at the far end closer to the door.    They were sitting very close to each other.    Yes.    I was quite – yes I was quite far.    So the table is round so it was the Minister, it would have been possibly Mr Bobat and Mr Whitley.  The DG was sitting here and the other Chair was taken by Mr Momoniat and Mr Dondo was in the middle of ...(intervenes).    Sorry Mr Dondo Mogajane was much closer to theMinister than I was.    I am sorry?    It is possible that my position at the table would havedisadvantaged me in that manner but I think for me it was because I was waiting for the actual meeting to start.  For me the most important thing that I was waiting for there was the part where the Minister would start talking to us about his agenda and the important things.    Yes I am saying I did not hear it.    Yes.    So verified perhaps I would not say I took time to verify but what I had asked for to be done by people in the Communications Unit was to source what we could find on Google so that we could have an interim sort of CV on the website because that is the thing that people were interested in.They wanted to know who he was, where he came from and in the media he was being referred to as a back bencher.  So I had done that but we really needed a much more extensive CV that listed his experience, his background and help people form views about what kind of a person and what kind of a Finance Minister he would make.

MR MOKOENA:  Were you aware of any contracts that could have been concluded by the DG and any Advisors on behalf of the Minister?    But for emphasis she can still read paragraph 24 into the record,on page 30. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good morning, Chair.    Good morning, Mr Manyi.    Yes, Chair.   Thank you very much, Chair.  Mr Manyi, good morning once again.    You recall that at the end of your testimony on the 14th of November 2016 through the Commission's attorney the Legal Team addressed a letter to you dated 15 November 2018.  You recall that?    And you would remember that in that letter the Commission's Legal Team set out a number of topics that it intended to raise with you in the course of the resumption of your testimony this morning, correct?    And you will recall also that after receipt of that letter the Commission's attorney sent through to you a bundle of documents which comprises some material that the Legal Team would like to raise with you this morning.  You received the bundle I take it?    Yes and you were invited to include whatever information that you in turn would have wanted to raise this morning, correct?    And you did so?    And that bundle is now before you and Chair a copy has been transmitted to you in the course of Friday and may I remind you where it should be and with your permission admitted it as an exhibit?  You will recall that Mr Manyi ...(intervenes).    Yes.    Yes, Chair.    Chair, first of all thanks that you now have before youExhibit M and you will recall that that is the bundle on the strength of which Mr Manyi testified previously on the 14th of November and that will be the bundle that I would canvas with him with reference to his version to Ms Williams' evidence.I will get to it in a moment but what we did following upon the letter that Mr Manyi confirms he has received was to prepare a bundle of documents and we have now labelled that bundle as Exhibit M1 to follow sequentially from Exhibit N.I have asked my colleagues to mark yours on the spine as Exhibit M1.  Chair, can I ...(intervenes).    May I kindly ask ...(intervenes).    Indeed.  Indeed.    May I propose that it be marked Exhibit M1?   So that when the time comes to begin to write submissions we know where to find it?    I am indebted to you, Chair.    Yes, I understand from my colleagues that it has beenmarked and just to confirm Mr Manyi before you, you will have two bundles.  The one is Exhibit M which includes your statements that you previously canvassed on the 14th of November 2018, correct?    And the second bundle will be the one that includes documents previously made available to you which has been marked Exhibit M1 at the back of it.    Chair, I think that underlines the data set that we will be dealing with.  Mr Manyi, before I leave the identification of the data set can I confirm with you that you have now prepared yourself on the topics that we identified in the letter to you that we would like to raise with you and you are quite comfortable that we should raise those questions with you, correct?    Not at all Chair as long as he identifies ...(intervenes).    Where we get the statement in the bundle.    Chair, can we take the liberty of marking it in due course?   And we will distribute copies later.    Can I propose that it comes at the end of Exhibit M1?    And then it will begin at page 281.    I will take the liberty of ...(intervenes).    Paginating it.    Yes.   Indeed, Chair.    Chair I am technologically challenged, but what was indicated as a short statement has gone for far too long now.    Yes we can make those arrangements during ...(intervenes).    During the lunch adjournment.    Yes, Chair.    Chair, we have put it in a bundle as page 275.    No it is already in the bundle.    Yes.    Mr Manyi before I get to the details of your evidence in the written statements many as they are that you have now submitted to the Commission and also your oral expansion of that evidence from this morning can I ask you this?As you sit here today in the witness box do you accept that members of the Gupta family and the businesses that they own have been seriously implicated by way of credible evidence led before the Chairperson up to this point in serious malfeasance of State Capture?    Mr Manyi do not un-contextualise my question.  I have not asked you about proceedings involving the Gupta family relating to Estina in other courts.  I have asked you questions about evidence in this Commission.  Youhave been following the proceedings of this Commission since it began, correct?    You accept that the proceedings of this Commission are televised live and they are reported on credibly in news media both print and television almost daily?  Do you accept that that happens?    Yes but you watched the proceedings of this TV – of this – of the proceedings of this Commission on TV.  That is why you were able to see what Ms Williams said about you in your absence from this Commission but onTV, correct?    Mr Manyi you know, do you not, that Mr Maseko came to tell the Chairperson about the extent of unlawful instructions imposed upon him by a member of the Gupta family, you know that?    Mr Maseko came here and testified almost or the whole day about that evidence.  Do you have reason to doubt what he told the Chairperson?    What Mr Maseko told the Chairperson about the true nature of the instruction given to him or imposed upon him by a member of theGupta family?    Do you have reason to doubt what then Deputy Minister Jonas told the Chairperson about the offer that was made to him by a member of the Gupta family?    Please answer the second question because you have answered the first.  You can explain the second question later on.    Minister Nene then Minister of Finance came here totell the Chairperson a number of things including the way he was dismissed.  Do you have reason to doubt what he told the Chairperson in that regard?    You did not listen to the evidence of Minister Nene.    Did you follow the evidence of Minister Gordhan?    But you heard what he said to the Chairperson even though you may have lost concentration.    Do you have reason ...(intervenes).    Mr Manyi you heard the evidence of Mr Fuzile?    You heard that part of his evidence when he told the Chairperson about what Mr Godongwana said to him ...(intervenes).    Godongwana.    Yes.    You heard that evidence?    Yes.  Do you have any reason to doubt what he said to the Chairperson as you sit here today?    Just explain to me why?    Yes.  Mr Manyi you indicated earlier on that TNA lost its government business because it was punished for revealing what you call white collar corporate capture of the state.  Did I understand your evidence to be correct ...(intervenes).    When I characterise it that way?    Yes.  When in your view did this punishment begin?    I thought that you told the Chairperson that thereporting slant of TNA from the beginning was not to behave like an enemy of the state but also to slant reporting in a manner that reflects positive elements of state activity and that is why you liked it, correct?    Chairperson can I place on record that my questions are fairly straightforward.  They elicit a yes or no answer and they do not require this longwinded explanation which I did not call for.    Thank you, Chair and Chair can I just explore the last question on Mr Manyi's liking for the New Age media newspaper and his dislike for the so called mainstream media with your permission.  You see Mr Manyi, you have now told the Chairperson that the reason you regarded the mainstream media as a cabal included the very fact that they were critical of the state in their reporting,correct?    They were critical in their report about state activity and that is the reason why you did not like the slant of being almost always critical against government.    Yes.    For that part of 10% you are talking about they were critical of the state, correct?   Well I am just repeating what you told the Chairperson.    For that 10% of the reasons why you did not like the cabal.    It is because they were critical of the state in their reporting.    In the way they reported on the state activity.    Yes.    You see Mr Manyi a media criticism of the state and what state actors are doing is nothing new.  When TNA was criticising the state on your version it was revealing problems about National Treasury about this what you call wastage of R1.7 billion.  That was nothing new.  The media has always done that.    Yes.  Chair, I understood him to say that there are many reasons.  One of them relates to what he calls 10% of the critical reporting by the mainstream media of state activity.    Chair, may I clarify the question by being factual?    I think it might help all of us.  Mr Manyi can you go toExhibit M1.    Are you at Exhibit M1?    Can you please go to page 231?    You have explained to the Chairperson that Exhibit – sorry page 231 reflects the total ad spend by GCIS to all the media competitors.  Correct?    And you have indicated that the total ad spend for that year 2011 to 2012 was R192 million odd, correct?    194?    Right let us work with the figure and you have indicated that on that figure TNA for that year and that year alone ...(intervenes).    Yes.    Ja, well firstly I must say I rest my case, thank youChairperson for that corroboration, but again if you have people that despite you showing them the real transcript of the report then they refuse to correct what they are saying.  Why should we believe them when they say New Age has got things wrong?  So it means they are not trustworthy as people.  I don’t think ...(intervenes).      That’s correct, that’s what was objected to Chairperson, and then when we raised these things then it was seen as being unreasonable.  For instance on that one as recently as now Chairperson you see this one, The Star they say Guptas sets up for sale and so on and they put my face there, and all that, now why – what is my face doing on Gupta assets and the only reason they’re doing this is deliberate because they have already characterisedGupta’s as monsters and what have you, so now because they want to deal with me so in order to deal with me they must mirror me into this thing so that what – I become sort of a proxy for all the things that the Guptas stand for, then I must suffer all of that.  This is the kind of a South Africa we have, very unfair.     Chair thank you very much, I am not going to explore that issue further but my understanding of self-regulation of the media in this country is that there are always channels available to lodge complaints, where there has been factually inaccurate or unfair reporting and there is always a code to whichmost of the major media houses subscribe to, there are enquiries constituted by the Press Ombud whose decision would be subject to appeal by the Appeals Committee of the relevant self-regulator and that explains why in a democratic country we all have to be men and women of the last.  But where I was Chair is at page 234 ...(intervenes).     You know Chairperson this is where I was going to.  You have indicated two critical instances of media reporting which was not factually accurate, but the point is this why would one newspaper lose government business because of that and the rest of the media who are equally guilty on that assumption of factual inaccurate reporting don’t go out of business.  Perhaps Mr Manyi wouldhelp us there.    Mr Manyi I think I do understand and it is somethingthat I am going to converse with you at length tomorrow, because on your ...(intervenes).     Oh are you not here tomorrow?    Chair I will be guided by you.    Yes, Chair I have not even started with the essential details that he has given this morning, I have not even gone to this statement.  I’mjust trying to understand the basic theory of his suggestion.  But a mere critical reporting against the State means that you will fall down on your belly by losing Government business, that I don’t understand.    And I want to test that Chair because we were at page 231 when we got diverted by all of these things, and we have now confirmed that the total advertisement spend from just GCIS alone for 2011 to 2012 was R194 million for all the media houses for that year, just from one Government entity and that is GCIS.  On that approach Mr Manyi gave some explanation about how that pie was divided amongst the various houses.  What I wanted to test with him is what youhad already put to him about the comparisons that he has made that for instance SABC got the biggest pie, and if I may ask for your permission to test the answers that he has given in that regard, because the suggestion that I would like to make is that the comparison is not well-founded.    Mr Manyi are you at page 231?    Can I put my questions now?    Thank you.  Mr Manyi are you at page 231?    Yes.     Okay, you have indicated that Ad24 for that year gotalmost R18 million, correct.       We now know from what you told us that Ad24 is owned by the Naspers Group, and that that group owns a number of newspaper publications, correct?     The include amongst others City Press, correct.      So that if you were to test what City Press got by way of government revenue from GCIS you will not look at the total group owned byNaspers; you look at City Press itself for that year correct?    Well look at what you – the figures that you produce, say about the total revenue and by City Press from GCIS as it …(indistinct) for that year.  If you look somewhere towards the bottom of the page, and understand the identification of the publications here is alphabetical you will see that somewhere there is City Press reference and my reading of what City Press and by way of revenue for that year was R199 323,30, these are the figures that you yourself produced, correct?    Chair almost two thirds down the page, you will see that there is A.    No, with page 231 yes.    And Chair I will take you through some of the newspapers under that stable, but the point for now is that if you take City Press which of Mr Manyi’s evidence constitute almost 80 to 90% of the Ad24 Naspersstable, for that year alone City Press received revenue of R199 000 odd, do you see that?    And now that we know that City Press has been in a long-established business of publication, at least by the year 2011 and 2012, we will look at the open source information so that we could tell the Chairperson about its lineage up to 2011 and 2012, but for now if you take the total at revenue and by City Press for that financial year, was almost R200 000.  Compare that with what TNA earned for that year and you will find that Chair at page 234.    The second last entry at page 234, are you there?     And we now know from your evidence that for that financial year on a comparative level TNA earned almost R8.7 million of Government advertisement revenue from GCIS, correct?    Yes or no?       Let me suggest to you immediately that that explanation I will demonstrate shortly that it is mistaken, but for now let’s confirm the facts.  On the facts as we have it for that financial year TNA has earned 20 times more than City Press from Government’s advertisement business.    Mr Manyi I am going to take you to TELMA and I will show you that the new age was not even assessed on the basis of TELMA, and I will show you that your attempt to run away from a comparison on a paper by paper basis by suggesting that City Press was a weekend newspaper and the New Age was a daily publication and therefore the comparison in terms of revenue is inappropriate that is not correct.  Look at the other daily newspapers.  You have told the Chairperson as I recall your evidence, and I hope that I got it correct, at page 231, about the Daily Sun.  You remember that?    Chair if you go to page 231.    You will see that the fourth bottom entry relates to the Daily Sun and my recollection of Mr Manyi’s evidence was that that was the newspaper with the biggest daily circulation.   Look at what it earned from GCIS for that month.  Can you confirm the figures for us please?    Yes Chair.     The biggest daily newspaper of what circulation...(intervenes).     Chair if I may conclude the daily newspaper comparison by dealing with two additional daily publications, which you will get on page 234.    Yes Chair.    Fourth from the bottom is The Times.  Now Mr Manyi I take it that you know that The Times is also a daily newspaper, correct?   The Times, if you look at page 234.    The answer is?    Am I correct when I suggest to you that The Times is a daily publication?    It was?    Yes, at that point in time, am I correct that in 11/2012 it was a daily publication?    And look at the amount of government advertisementrevenue it received from GCIS, it is about R183 379,20, correct?    Yes.    You know, Chair, Mr Manyi produced these figures in order to persuade you that in the broader scheme of things TNA got about what?  5/6% of the total ad spent from government in 2011/2012.  When we try to examine that broad proposition on a granular basis with reference to his own figures we are told that that is a technical exercise.The key question is what is the point of producing these figures if you do not want us to examine them closely on a more accurate analytical basis?   Chair, if you look at – and I will be quick here, if you look at three columns above The Times you will see The Star and you will see that The Star for that total 12 months period and R97 000.    Yes, it is 247.    You have The Herold and the list goes on and on.    So on any comparative basis and I would like to put this conclusion to Mr Manyi for him to comment if he wants to.    These are newspapers which have been in business for quite some time and all of them, and at least those that we have looked at, earn less than R200 000 per annum and TNA in its first year of business earns more than8.5 million, correct?  The first year of business?    Chair, I see it is past 16   Yes, Chair.    You see Mr Manyi you talk about government being dissatisfied and government welcoming a new player, but in fairness this ad spent is decided by GCIS through media buying over which you exercised corporate control, correct?   Chair, let me move on.  Mr Manyi you earlier on indicated that the most objective vehicle to determine where government should place its business for media buying is the TELMA system.  Do you recall that?  My notes says that you accredited TELMA as the most objective tool to determine where government should place its advertising business.  Do you remember that?    And you know, do you not, that part of the TELMA requirement is that a publication where government decides to place its business must have an accredited audited readership and circulation figures, correct?  You shake your head up and down, what does that mean?    Yes, but the point is …(intervenes).    But, Chair, the record does not capture nodding.    We now agree that part of the TELMA tool of evaluation requires that a publication which would receive government business must have accredited and audited readership and circulation figures.  It is quite clear on what you have told us now – up to now that TNA did not have those accredited readership and circulation figures, correct?    So TNA chose to use a totally different model of auditing its own figures?   When you or Mr Dubuc assessed whether or not GCIS should place its business with TNA you are telling the Chairperson there would be audited figures from TNA?    Remember the analysis is done by TELMA, which is a template and the template would decide all things being equal which publicationshould enjoy government business, it is a template.  Are we agreed on that?    And the template will show immediately on the spot which publication enjoys the audited accredited circulation figures, because newspapers would have submitted those figures, correct?  It is on the template.  You do not have to go and make an inquiry elsewhere; it is on the template.    Chair, if I may add on that score.  I mean we are a country of laws.    Chair, we are a country of laws and here the law requires that TELMA should be applied.   It does not require that TELMA should be ignored.  If someone has difficulty with TELMA, you go and apply for an obtained deviation.    Yes.  Mr Manyi you accept that TELMA is part and parcel of the law that require lawful placing of government advert business?    No but, you say that TELMA is meaningless?    Do you say that TELMA is a meaningless process indeciding where government should place business?    But I thought that …(intervenes).    Are you saying that you could ignore TELMA and go ahead and place government business with any publication?   I am not talking about other businesses; I am talking about – and I am not talking about other departments.  I am just talking about GCIS, because this is the entity which you and I are talking about with reference to your own figures.    Chair, I see it is 16   Chair, I am hesitant to hazard a guess in the light of the answers that I am getting, because there is not a straightforward answer.  So I might well be misleading you in suggesting to you that this is the time I think I would be able to deal with.    Yes, we are available, Chair.    Thank you, Chair. 
MR MZWANELE MANYI:  Hopefully.    Mzwanele Manyi.    No.    Yes I do.    So help me God.    Hi.   Yes I do.    Yes I can confirm that.    Yes I got the bundle.    Yes.    Yes I did.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.    Yes, Chairperson I am so ready such that because I also am not assisted by any legal representative so therefore, Chairperson I seek yourindulgence, Chairperson that I am allowed to go through my statement as I have prepared it and then so that I can, because I have been given these documents – these questions I can go through these questions in my own approach and then thereafter Mr Maleka is free to ask any question in whatever shape or form but I request, Chairperson that I be allowed to table my statement because I do have the questions and I have prepared answers and I request that I get given the opportunity.  It is on the short statement Chairperson.  It is about five pages that I go through my statement.  I am not going to read word for word.  I go through my statement and I am sure I will be answering a lot of his questions so that he can then ask those that are outstanding.   Not precisely Chair.  What I am asking is that because the Commission has been very kind enough to give me the areas of questions I have prepared my statement in line with those areas of questions.  So I am requesting to have a first bite at giving the answers of to those questions and if it turns out thatthere are some inadequacies anywhere Mr Maleka is free to fill in the gaps and probe some more, but I think in that way Chairperson there will be much more benefit for the Commission because I have sequenced – because what I have seen happening here you get, you get from page five to page 20 to page, it gets very disorienting Chairperson.  So in order for me to have a proper flow I am requesting that I get given the opportunity to table the answers in the form of the statement which are already contained in my statement.  I think in that way it will really assist.    Thank you Chair.    Okay Chair thank you.  So the first question Chairperson related to me being at GCIS how does it happen and all of that and the straight answer there Chairperson is that my going to GCIS was from the Department of Labour.  It was actually a transfer.  That is a formal categorisation of how I went there.  It is a transfer and with – when a transfer happens some of the questions that Mr Maleka has asked do not arise.  For instance he has asked a question about whether was I interviewed, those questions do not arise Chairperson when getting transferred they arise when you get appointed.  Then there is assessment and all of this, but I was already in the public service.  So that question does not arise.  I was transferred and in fact I have tried to assist the Chairperson Mr Maleka in terms of whether how does that happen in the first place.Chairperson I have got Exhibit 1 here which Mr Maleka will find on page 227 and page 228 in his bundle.    M1.    Yes Chair.    Page 227 and 228 is the Public Service Act.  I just took extracts there Chairperson of just two pages.  Just a cover page of the Act and the actual paragraph which is Section 12(3)(a) which reads;"That the President may transfer the Head of a National Department or National Government component before or at the expiry of his or her term of extended term to perform functions in a similar or any other capacity in a National Department or National Government component in a post of equal, higher or lower grading or additional to the establishment as the President considers appropriate."So that is a Section I trust Chair regularises what – my appointment and on top of that Chairperson on your bundle page 229 I have got Exhibit 2 which is actually my letter of transfer.  So everything was done according to the book Chairperson and then I move on to my time at GCIS.  One of the things that was asked was the issue around I think the issues around the Bid Adjudication Committee.  So what I have then done Chairperson is that on Exhibit 3 ...(intervenes).    Go ahead I am comfortable.    Yes, yes.    Yes Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson 2011.    Yes.    It came afterwards Chairperson.    Okay.  Right, okay so one of the questions that I need to answer Chairperson is on Exhibit 3 which talks to, I think it is probably a follow up, but Mr Maleka will then probe some more.  It is just an Exhibit 3 Chairperson in terms of the financial delegations.  The one that still responds to the issue of me saying that I did not say I wanted to sign off everything.  I wanted to sign off that which was R500 000 and above and that was already – that was a financial delegation.  So I just took one page of the financial delegation Chairperson.  It is on your bundle page 230 that is where it is.  It is just one page.  There is something written there at the bottom about concurrence with the CEO prior to the finalisation that is when things are above R500 000.  So that is one Chair.  Then there was a question about ...(intervenes).    Yes.    Yes Chairperson it is my slave name Jimmy.    Okay ...(intervenes).    Yes.   That is correct Chairperson.    Yes.  It is part of the decolonisation exercise.  I am trying to be African here.  So yes Chairperson.  So then the next issue was the issue around I am saying here my interactions with other departments was done at Chief Director level.  We use a system there which we call TELMA to determine where to place adverts.  GCIS sits with the most objective tool in deciding where adverts should be placed.  Departments via their Head of Communication would approve the placements.  Sometimes they would actually even defy advice from GCIS.Then I then make a point Chairperson that the issue of media diversity was at the centre of GCIS communication strategy that it was so much at the centre that GCIS even had a subsidiary called MDDA run by a very able cadre Mr Lumko Mtimde at the time.  MDDA is Media Development and Diversity Agency.  The brief of this agency was to ensure that government is assisting in terms of developing otherplatforms of communication.  Government does not want a monologue.  Government wants to make sure that all the voices of everyone in South Africa are heard as it were.  So that is a posture of government.  So within Media Diversity there are two groups of companies or two groups of media groupings that could be find there covered within the Act.  It says in fact an act on this matter, MDDA Act as well.  So, but there are two groups of media that you find there.  There is what is called Community Media and there is also what is called Small Media – Commercial Small Media.  So those are the two groups of media that are covered within the Act.So in my view Chairperson when the issue of the New Age came about it was a very welcome development because it fitted in very well with what governmentwas trying to do.  Government had a proper infrastructure of even helping the development of these agencies – of these companies.  So when this one came on its own not even with the assistance – the direct assistance of government in there so I thought well this is a very welcome move and in particular the TNA – the New Age brought in a different editorial stance Chairperson which was decidedly not hostile to government, which was very important because at the time government as suffering from a serious media onslaught generally and the challenge that government has had is to be – is to say to media, try – we are not saying try to be nice to government but try and be balanced in your reporting, but it looked like Chairperson the posture of mainstream media is that when you do something right the attitude is that you get paid to do it in anyway.  They wait until you do something wrong then they headline with that.  Now the posture of TNA was the complete opposite.  It was a posture of saying the glass is half full as opposed to the glass is half empty.  That was the posture of it.  So it was a very welcome posture as it were and also even price wise it was not the most expensive in terms of the ads for the same amount of squarecentimetres in that page or there is half a page ad or full page ad they were still much more competitive than others.Now Chairperson one of the exhibits which I did not submit because I did my research late, I do not know if the Registrar can give this to the Chair?    Okay I only have two copies here Chairperson.  I want to read on the one.    Yes, unfortunately.  Now ...(intervenes).    Okay ...(intervenes).    If Chairperson you can – the particular page I wanted to look, to ask ...(intervenes).    Is the second last page that starts with that is the concept.  The page before that one Chair it starts with that is the concept.    Now as you are browsing through this Chairperson this is a letter written by Ms Phumla Williams on the same subject of New Age and she was responding to a journalist here called Ranjeni Munusamy.  So Ranjeni had raised a very interesting issue about that these breakfasts are elitist, they deprive people an opportunity to come to these elaborate breakfasts and so on and why is GCIS involved in these breakfasts?  Now and Ms Williams was here last time arguing that she was being pressured to support these breakfasts and all of that.  That was herposture, but this is a letter Chairperson that I think we must thank Ms Ranjeni Munusamy that she had made this letter public.  This is from the website Daily Maverick dated 6th of February 2013.  Now just to read just couple paragraphs of this Chair for the benefit of those that do not have this copy.  This is an extract from the letter of Ms Phumla Williams responding to the issue of GCIS being involved in breakfasts and ...(intervenes).    Thank you, Chair.  So in addition to what I have said, Chairperson this is what Ms Phumla Williams said in February 2013 and I must underline Chair but at that time I was not even in the public – I was not in GCIS at    It is actually also the point, Chairperson because I think in the Commission she had come here basically with a posture that is opposite to what is being said here and her posture, Chairperson was one that said it is one that was not understanding what she seems to be fully conversant with here and all that and yes her doing it last time it was more like I mean she used the word that she was being bullied into doing this thing but if I read this article here like I have just done, Chairperson you can see that this is a person that believed in this thing.So this is why it is quite strange how Ms Williams operates that on the one side she says this and the next time says something completely opposite which is without belabouring the point, Chairperson.  We have dealt with the SMS matterwhich was – also my surprise because the last time I left GCIS we were on very good terms.  There were no issues at all.  That is why I was comfortable to talk to her and then before I knew there was a 180 degree turn in her attitude.So I just do not know what actually happens is happening in her space that she goes left, she goes right, she goes left, she goes right but anyway this is what she said.    No, I am able to tell, Chairperson.  In fact I just want to    So the whole question about breakfast ...(intervenes).    No, Chairperson I think – okay I hear you, Chairperson.  There is nothing personal here, Chairperson.  This is the position of the Department.  I think this is why it is complemented by what I have said.  In my statement here I have said that the measures of the New Age was a welcome development so this backs it up.  So this was our position, Chairperson.  We wanted diversity, wanted a multiplicity of voices.    Yes.    Yes.  No, Chairperson I think I hear you but let me just read the first opening paragraph to contextualise what capacity she was speaking    Okay.   I understand, Chairperson yes.    I think this here is more government position.    Her statement under oath is probably a personal position.    Okay thank you, Chair.    Thank you, Chair.  So, Chairperson there was also somequestion of whether I would have encouraged any DG or anybody to have used the New Age.  Almost definitely, Chairperson I would have encouraged everyone I could come across because this was actually assisting in the government's approach of multiplicity of voices.So if anyone wants to come here and say Manyi encouraged me I am not going to create war to deny any of that because chances are that I might have and so on although I might not remember the specifics but it is something that generally I would do because I thought it is the right thing to do.What I also liked about the New Age is that what they did, Chairperson is that the creativity and the innovation of reporting per province.  So what you would find in that publication is that at one sitting you could say okay let me check what is happening in North West and then you get a sense of what is happening in North West.What is happening in Mpumalanga?  What is happening you know the different provinces.  So it had that.  So it was a very useful publication and all thatand I think also for government it would have been very useful because government generally has a problem in having its messages carried across because media – mainstream media takes the position that says they are not the conveyer belt for government.  They are the watchdog.  This is the approach they take that they are the watchdog.Now government has invested in a lot of equipment hoping in various press places I mean if you go to GCIS in Pretoria, you go to GCIS in Cape Town a lot of money has been spent by government to ensure that they use media as a partner in communicating – in its communication.But media is not of the same mind.  Media is there to say what wrong areyou doing.  They are there with a red pen.  In fact when you go to a press briefing – when you go to a press briefing you can go there, Chairperson and read 10 pages and all that and the very first questions that come after the press briefing is not anything about what you have written.It is the things that they came to the briefing with.  It is an opportunity for them to ask all these other questions.  So as a result when you look at the newspaper the next day you will be lucky to find one sentence of what you had read reflected in there.So when you have a paper like the New Age which has a different posture in terms of half – the glass is half full it was a very welcome posture and not that by the way, Chairperson it did not reflect some of the wrong things that were happening in government which I will take the Chairperson through just to illustrate that this paper was indeed balanced in its approach.  Now one of the things for instance that would be used against this paper Chairperson would be that it is not a member of the ABC, Audit Bureau of Circulation.  So what this means Chairperson that the big four in themedia space, you know, your Times Media, your what is now called Tiso Blackstar, your independent, what is the other one Naspers and Caxton, the four big groups.  They have this thing called Audit Bureau of Circulation where they work – they audit how much of the newspapers have been printed and have been circulated and sold and all of that and then based on that then they come up with a number through that audit process to say this newspaper has got a circulation of 100 000 and that circulation figure then gives a basis for the rate card.  So in other words the rate card is a pricing mechanism to say do I price this, do I price this half a page this much?  Do I price a full page this much and so on based on the reach that that newspaper would have and that – then that determines how much should an ad cost as it were. So that is what they would use.Now the New Age was not part of that deliberately so, because they did not believe that that system was a welcoming system.  It was the view of the New Age editors at the time that in fact this thing was also conflict because – riddled with conflict because all the people that sat on the board of this thing were all from, you know it is almost like a cabal of the same newspapers sitting here and deciding that okay you have this much, you have this much and all that and that determines, that determines the price of an ad.Now this ABC thing Chairperson was also used if you like as a mechanism, artificial barriers to entry.  So newspaper – Community Media would not make the criteria required to be in this ABC and all that.  So what that does then is that if this Community Media or as New Age you go to a private sector company to try and get them to put ads in your paper.  The first thing they ask you is your ABC and if you do not have that ABC they cannot do business with you.  So this has been the problem.So at the time when I was at GCIS it was a be all and end all to have ABC. So we would use Community Media deliberately so knowing they have not got ABC ratings, but because there are other ways of checking this for instance the New Age was using audit to say auditors must audit how many papers they are circulating, but it was not the approach of New Age in any case to look at circulation.  Their approach was based on what they call readership and the philosophy here Chairperson is that, the philosophy is that with readership for instance if there is a family of five not all five members of the family must buy a particular newspaper.  One newspaper is enough maybe for the entire household as it were.So New Age was using that kind of a system to say how many households are there.  How many people are in a household.  So if we sold one newspaper thatnewspaper will be read by 10 people as an example.  So that is a kind of philosophy they were using in terms of saying what is the reach of their publication.    Yes.  Thank you Chairperson it is a very important questions.  Stats SA ...(intervenes).    Yes.  Yes thank you Chairperson.  That is correct Chairperson.  That is why I did say earlier there is an issue of audit.  So there will be an auditor that would audit how many papers have been sold so to speak, sent,or because they used different models of distributing the paper or rather selling thepaper.  The one model was the retail model where you would go and sell like at the street corners and all of that, but the other model was subscription based.So they would say this particular government department as an example requires a 100 copies.  So it is very clear 100 copies go to Mpumalanga, a 1000 copies go to wherever.  So there will be subscription based and the subscription base was in fact the lion share in terms of the revenue streams because those were guaranteed and all that.  So there would be all clear arrangements with various departments to say or various government departments to say I require so many newspapers and all that.  So that would be one firm way of establishing exactly how many newspapers would be out and then you multiply that also by a factor of howmany people are in that government department and in fact some of those people will take the paper home and STATS SA is very meticulous Chairperson about the number of people in a household.  So that information is readily available.  In the TELMAS system all of those nitty gritties are also in there just to get to know the reach of the paper and all that, but the important thing Chairperson on this matter is that the GCIS rather, I beg your pardon, the TNA approach was a lot more scientifically sound than the ABC in this way.  One of the newspapers in this country that has got the biggest circulation is Daily Sun.  Now the Daily Sun probably trumps everybody in terms of how many newspapers it circulates, but what ABC does not seem to take into account is something called psychographics, because it is all well and good to say my paper has gone to a million people, but what are the psychographics of those people?  Can you take an analysis of a judgment Chairperson and put it on a Daily Sun and hope that the Daily Sun market is going to read that?  They would not.  It is not their cup of tea.  They are interested in other things as it were.So therefore the TNA approach was much more targeted as well and therefore the issue of what we call spillage was less in TNA.  So with these others there is a lot of spillage.  I mean if I live in Northern Cape and one copy of a Sowetan is identical from the one side – from Limpopo to Cape Town is an identical copy of the Sowetan I mean that blunt approach how much value does it add to somebody sitting in Postmasburg and so on?  You will find that there is nothing in Postmasburg covered in the Sowetan.  In fact I can even bet even today if you were to open Sowetan today Chairperson I am almost sure there is not much covered in Postmasburg, but if you had the New Age you would have a focus on Northern Cape.  You would have a focus on this and all that and what that does it helps evengovernment in those regions to know what are the issues affecting people in the various localities.So instead of buying one paper that is just blunt that is just covering Gauteng issues and maybe something in Cape Town and Durban and so on but the rest of the country is almost non-existent as it were in terms of the coverage. So that is the – what New Age did and that is why this ABC was actually not meaningful.  In fact Chairperson I think government should be wary of insisting because I know here of lately they are insisting on this as well.  This is part of the capture of government by the newspapers.  Newspapers actually have captured government because government is now also almost insisting on ABC, which I think is a mistake because it is anti-developmental.  You cannot have a situation where government is going to insist on this thing, because this is an artificial barrier to entry.  New players are not able to go into this.  New players will not have a rate card that recognises them.So it is a really big mistake.  So I would really be encouraging governmentnot to be using ABC.  They can use it but they must not exclude those that do not have it and all of that Chairperson.  So that is that one.  To proceed Chairperson then there is the issue of cost and the subtext of how much we paid and Chairperson as I go through this I am going to ask the Registrar, I do not know if you have got equipment here to be able to put and flag this, just one slide.    Okay Chairperson.    It is just one slide by the way.    I wanted to show.    In terms of the costing.    Now ...(intervenes).   Thank you Chair.  Thank you for the protection Chair.  Now Chairperson I had put a slide here.  It is a pity that the Chairperson does not have the copy of this here and I see also the printout of – printouts are not as clear, but my copy is much clearer that I wish I could even share it with the Chairperson.    Yes I have.   No this one is – actually it is part of the statement this one.    On page – yes it is in the statement this one Chairperson on Exhibit 4 and 5 page 231 and 235, 236 to 240.    231, yes, Chairperson from 231.    Yes.  What I am showing there Chairperson is that financial year 2011/2012 because sometimes when we deal with TNA we deal with it out of context.  So I thought it is important that we must deal with it ...(intervenes).    The New Age, yes Chairperson.   I think it is important that we deal with it in context.  Now on Exhibit Q4 Chairperson which will be there on page 231 to 235.  There is a whole list in those exhibit Chairperson of – from 231 to 235 of all the media that was ever paid in GCIS in 2011/2012 which was my period.  So the total bill for the year was like R194 million.  That is how much GCIS paid in the year 2011/2012.  So I am going to deal with the two years that I was there 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.  So the first date ...(intervenes).    Yes Chairperson.   On my actual statement, the one I am reading now Chairperson on 231 that will be a list of – there is a total at the top ...(intervenes).    And the breakdown.    Yes so I am just talking to that.    Is the total that 194.    Of all the publications.    Yes.  So then the total is R194 million.    It is 194 169 477,96.   Have you got it Chairperson?    Right.    So that is, that is the global amount in terms of total spend on media by GCIS in the year 2011/2012.  So the amount there is R194 169 477,96 that is the global amount.    Yes Chair.    Yes financial year, yes.    That is the financial year.  Okay so just on a high level Chairperson then I then on my statement which I am reading now I just ...(intervenes).    Yes okay let me explain this what you see in front of you Chair.  What you see right at the top you see 2011/2012 financial year expend right at the top and the number there is R194 169 477,96.  That is right at the top.   And then there is the next line is 2012/2013 and then 13/2014 there is a blank because I was not there.    Now on – then you get this other table at the bottom supplier total expend that 199 that the Chair read is just for that one company called Adreach.    It is just the one company.    Then the next one there is Ads24 which is your Naspers at R17 million.  So that is the one.  So what I have then done Chairperson to – so that there is about five pages of the spreadsheet that shows exactly which company was paid how much.  Now what I have then done, Chairperson just to take just the ones that constitute the lion's share and I put only those on my statement ...(intervenes).    Just to say of this 194 here with the big hitters of that.    Because the others are just sharing the spoils.    Yes.    Followed by just in terms of magnitudes, followed by Ads24.  Ads24 is a marketing arm of Naspers.  It is your City Press, Rapport all of that group, Chairperson.  That group got R17 995 122.27.  That is what that group got and then you have got Avusa at the time which is now Tiso Blackstar which is where we are here today in this building those people in that year they got R11 219 856.86 and then there was Etv.  Etv got R8 517 788.36 and then you get the New Age and the New Age got R8 691 634.86.So that is how the lay of the land was, Chairperson and if you compute that you then say what is the percentage of the New Age in this whole lot?  The actual percentage, Chairperson if you work out the ratio between the R8 million andthe 194 it is actually 4.5%.Okay so of the total add spend of 2011/2012 the New Age got its piece of the action was 4.5%.  The rest was everybody else as it were.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes, no Chairperson I follow your logic but the figures here actually reflect that and by the way I am not complaining that they got more.  As you can see R68 million I am not complaining.Your line of thought is actually embedded in here and I am just showingwhat is it that we actually got – what actually what TNA actually got but not that I am complaining but I am saying this is the facts as they stand.Now also if you maybe actually SABC is not even a competitor of TNA because it is electronic broadcast and all of that so there is other dynamics there and all that.    But put that aside, Chairperson.  Even with the other newspapers the issue for me is that they may also be however big in terms of circulation but there is a spillage in the circulation.  So the effective communication does not happen there because it is just a blunt tool.  It is just one paper that isuniversal for the country and its usefulness to the various parts of the provinces leaves much to be desired.So therefore there must be some pricing consideration that takes into account target marketing versus a gunshot approach.  So what we have here you have got newspapers that have got call it a gunshot approach and you just hope for the best and all of that whereas when you do the weighting of the quality of distribution that is what it comes to, Chairperson that you may have a quantity of distribution but the qualitative aspects of that might be lacking and as far as government is concerned government is interested in both quality and quantity.    Average yes.    No, it is R199 000.  It is a small publication.   R199 000.    Yes.    Ads24, just below that one, Chairperson that R17 million.    Yes.    They have got Afrikaans Rapport.  They are a weekend newspaper mainly.    So yes.  So it is quite a big statement.    They have got City Press, has got one.  It is a weekend newspaper.    There is no City Press on a daily basis.    Okay.    Okay I hear you, Chairperson.  The – I think the question is correct.  There would be Ads24.  Maybe that would include Rapport which is adifferent newspaper, City Press, I do not know whatever else they might have but they are mainly those two.    Really for this for what we are paying for here.    That will be the weekend newspapers really in terms of this one.    Yes well, Chairperson it is not as – I hear you but it is not as simplistic as that because there is also crosspollination.  So for instance you find that the one newspaper could cover – the one newspaper in the group maybe to that point the one newspaper could cover this particular aspect. That same aspect can be covered in another sister publication and all that.  Similarly for instance you would find that with the New Age for instance they would have a system where much of what – they would cover whatever they cover in the newspaper but some of it would also be covered on the TV Section without you paying more as it were.So which mitigates the issue of a circulation of a newspaper because they have a TV aspect as well so when they go and do a value proposition a value proposition includes that although we pay for the newspaper but we will get some mentions on TV as it were.So the mechanical one on one comparison does not work.  The importantthing here, Chairperson is that these companies is just – it is the companies that you deal with a particular editorial line as it were and ...(intervenes).    Yes?    Yes.   No, no Chair.    Yes.  No, Chairperson – I think Chairperson perhaps that goes to the crux of the different understandings of State Capture because the narrative out there is that the New Age was like gobbling up all government money so my response here is to show that they got what they got but let us not create the impression that this newspaper gobbled up all of government advertising.  They just took what was due to them which was in proportion to their size as it were.  So it is just talking to its size that to be four percent, 4.5% was probably in proportion to its size.  So let us not create the impression that 4.5% is actually the 100% of the spend.  This is the issue Chairperson.  If you had a New Age given its size being paid R68 million now you are talking, but if you have a New Age consuming only 4.5% given its size you then say but what is this big fuss all about because it is in proportion to its size.   Okay.    Okay thank you Chairperson.  So on – so that is what are the numbers in terms of 2011/2012 and also Chairperson on Exhibit Q5 which is on page 236 to 240 it is the same kind of thing just different numbers, but there you can see that again SABC given its size and everything nobody is questioning them but they got R71 million.  Naspers got R20 million.  Tiso Blackstar got – they went from R11 million in 2011/2012 to more than double to R28,7 million and that does not mean then Chairperson that they doubled their circulation.  This is the thing.  Theywent from R11 million without doubling their circulation, but they still more than doubled almost tripled actually their revenue Tiso Blackstar.  So that is the thing and I think after this Commission here they will be even much more richer as it were because this is still their group.  So that is what is happening there Chairperson.  Etv went from R8 million to R10 million and TNA went from R8,6 million to 7 it actually went down.  So in the year 2012/2013 it was just a sliver.  If you had these gadgets here just to show in proportion you will see then Chairperson that in 2012/2013 the New Age was actually 3,2%.  So the number is even smaller as it were.  So the notion that they got more than their fair share is really not supported by substance Chairperson.  So yes.  So that I think that covers the question of cost and all that in terms of that one.  Now Chairperson I want to deal with the issue of Mr Maleka wanted to know the issues surrounding the liquidation of the New Age.  Now and I am saying here Chairperson in order to understand that it is important to understand the – how New Age/ANN7 that media house was perceived.  It was perceived as friendly to government, but the sample I am going to show you is going to show thatit was a balanced publication which was half full as opposed to half empty but at the same time if there is evidence of capture as it were this publication would show that and I think Chairperson I want to say that I think the demise of this publication was really because of its focus on what I would call white collar corporate capture of the State.  This is what – this is a phenomena that I think is actually at play in South Africa the white collar corporate capture of the State and this is exemplified by the kind of reportage that the New Age was doing and so on.  So back in May 2017 Chairperson there was a project that was happening at National Treasury.  That project was called IFMS, Integrated Financial Management System, which is a system meant to integrate HR finance and all that, and all that.  It is a project thatwas conceived way back in 2005 but it started to be rolled out from 2009 a R4,3 billion project.  That project Chairperson allow me to characterise it as a VBS cousin – cousin of VBS that project.You are sitting here Chairperson with – and I will go through some of the findings of the internal audit in terms of what happened in that project.  Total atrocity.  You will not believe Chairperson as I take you through that you could find such a malfeasance, I heard this new word here mentioned a lot.  You will be surprised Chairperson the malfeasance that is embedded at National Treasury that the New Age reported on, that ANN7 reported on, all of that which made these publications very unpopular with everybody that was part of this white collar corporate capture of the State.  Now I take you through Chairperson to – by way of example if you go to Exhibit 6.  Exhibit 6 ...(intervenes).    Page 241 to 246.  Have you got it Chairperson?    Yes.    This was a meeting of SCOPA, a recent meeting of SCOPA which was reflecting on the things that happened in this period of this IFMS.  Now there is a lot written here Chairperson.  There is only one important sentence.    Yes that is the one.   That is the one Chairperson.  I was only going to read of that Chairperson just one sentence.  It is about six pages of this including the minutes of SCOPA here, but I know Mr Maleka is pressed for time.  I will read just one sentence.    Where it says; "Members noted that IFMS had cost R1,7 billion to date with nothing to show for it."I repeat Chairperson. "Members noted that IFMS had cost R1,7 billion to date with nothing to show for it."Yes now that is very devastating here Chairperson coming out of ...(intervenes).    Sure.    Okay.  Thank you very much Chairperson for your indulgence.  So Chairperson this is what SCOPA had to say.  Now this was a projectof R4,3 billion.  So already almost halfway through we have not got a return on our investment.  Now what is crucial here Chairperson are the findings of this internal audit report and if you go to Exhibit Q7 on page 247 to 259 ...(intervenes).    Yes Chairperson it is an auditor's report.    Internal audit report.    Okay I beg your pardon Chairperson.  That PMG ...(intervenes).    Yes ...(intervenes).    Okay, okay.  That PMG, that Parliamentary Monitoring Group is just the – it is a website where Parliament records electronically its proceedings.    Yes.    Monitoring ...(intervenes).    Yes ...(intervenes).    Yes.    Yes Chairperson.  This is what recorded what transpired.    Yes it would have been recorded by SCOPA.    Yes Chairperson.  They even have names.  If you go through there is about six pages of this.  They even have names of which member said what.  It is all there.  Our Parliament is very transparent.    Okay.  So Chairperson everything is here.  Now what was tabled there Chairperson when we were having this discussion are the findings.  Now in terms of where are these findings?  I put this Exhibit Q7 here which you will find Chairperson on page 247 to 259 in your bundle.  This is what was tabled, but I summarise it on my statement Chairperson, but these are all the things that weretabled there.    But just so that I do not shuffle a lot of paper too much.  In my statement I summarise what is here.    What the internal audit found Chairperson is that in fact what they found is that there were at least 54irregularities basically.  54 findings of irregularities and those findings were categorised into two.  Catastrophic and high risk.  Of the 54 findings that were there 49 of those findings were found to be catastrophic.  So what does that catastrophic mean?  It means extreme inefficientand ineffective operations of control.  So basically on both these categories you could not put any reliance on the controls that were put there.  It was total chaos Chairperson.  Absolute, absolute chaos that they found there.They go through that report Chairperson, I have summarised here just some of the things that they mentioned in there.  One of the findings that they make there Chairperson is inadequate payment procedures.  So in other words you have no purpose, no scope, no objectives defined in the payment procedures.  That is what they found.  They found no budget information and no budget breakdown per year.  This is National Treasury.  In other words no supporting documents to justify the line items towards the R4,3 billion.  They found no formal independent quality assurance function in place.  So basically this thing was like on auto pilot.  No one says you are on the right track, you are on the wrong track it is just free flow and all that.Then there is an office called PMO, Project Management Office.  They found excessive expenditure there.  They make an example Chairperson here that this PMO was allocated R145 million for five years, but what happened there within thefirst 16 months they had already spent R70 million of that.  Almost 50% of that which shows that it was, in Xhosa Chairperson we would have said (Xhosa expression) I just do not know it in English.  Expenditure not related to the IFMS project.  I mean really Chairperson how could you find such a thing at National Treasury?  Expenditure not related to the IFMS when it is us as accounting officers when I was in government when you have a thing like this they hit you with something very serious, they say unauthorised expenditure.  You have used money for the purpose it was not designed for.  They come with a very serious thing and they say financial misconduct and they could even criminalise you for this, but it is happening right there at National Treasury.  They spent something like R4 million to pay forsomething different.  To pay for centralised supply database on a money that was meant for IFMS.The audit found that there were gaps identified within the SLA agreement, Service Level Agreement.  They found gaps which indicated, Chairperson that there were no penalty clauses, there were no performance criteria.  This is quite shocking, Chairperson that such malfeasance can happen at National Treasury.No timesheets to justify bills – hours billed.  No timesheets.  So in other words you know having worked in the consultancy space you put a line item there that you did research on this matter for three hours.  You bill for three hours.   These guys they did not have to do any of that but they were billing.  I then added up time – added up amount in terms of just that one line item how much did government spend?  R73 million was actually spent if you were to total up all those timesheets where there is no justification of hours and all that.There were also no sign offs or approval of invoices.  You know, Chairperson in government you cannot just pay.  An invoice must be approved andwhat that approval process entails is to check if things happened.  It should go through all the checklist.In this case National Treasury did not have the checklist and so one just billed and it is just approved.  Internal audit also found there were duplicate payment so I find that quite interesting as to what that is.  Duplicate payment, Chairperson talks to what I call staggered payment in my language.So what would happen is that there would be a bill, a bill that says we are charging you from services from the 1st of this month to the 25th of the month.  But then at the same time in that same period you will have another bill in the middle of that that will say from the 10th of this month maybe to the 1st of the next month.So you have an area that is overlapping right there but both those invoices would be paid as if it is two pieces of work happening in sequence.  So actually it was a serious issue that was happening there.  Now this is just Chairperson as it relates to payment services.The auditors did not look at how those companies were procured.  They did not look at all other things.  This is just on the one line item on payment of services and this is how much atrocity they found.I shudder to think what would have happened if they had also audited how all these suppliers were also part of this, Chairperson.  So this does not help in terms of engendering confidence.  You know you hear, Chairperson people saying Treasury must be protected.I am saying to myself that is very true.  Treasury must be protected but the question is from who and I would say, Chairperson this is a kind of thing that National Treasury must be protected from but the narrative given out there is that it is otherwise everything well and Chairperson I think Mr Pravin Gordhan saidsomething very important here that when you root out the cancer you must root out all of it.I agree with him and this is part of the cancer that must be rooted out, Chairperson.  I totally agree with him.  We must root out all the cancer.  So then what followed so I am mentioning this, Chairperson as some of the things that have made this media house unpopular because then there was ...(intervenes).    Correct, Chairperson.  If you look – if you go to Exhibit Q8it is actually there.    On page 260.      On page 260 is an example of what New Age would have reported on this matter.    Yes.  So that is what the headline Treasury chaos and all that.  So that is what New Age would do and then we would have Treasury people saying we are targeting – they are saying Treasury is being targeted and all of that when in fact the New Age was reporting the truth something based on an internal audit report of National Treasury.This is what the New Age was reporting on and then the response is that National Treasury is being unfairly targeted.  There is no unfair targeting.  We are exposing the rot that is being unearthed by the internal audit of National Treasury notof anybody else.National Treasury Audit is the one that did this work and this is what is happening there.  So Chairperson as I got towards the closure then this Chairperson in my view talks to – talks to the next thing I want to talk to is the issue of the – what then happened.Then a forensic investigation was ordered just to cut a long story short.  There was a forensic investigation and I think ...(intervenes).    Right, Chairperson let us go to lunch.  I have got ...(intervenes).    Yes.    Thank you, Chairperson.    Half an hour.   Okay.  Okay.  That does not include questions in between.    Unless you extend it.    Okay.    Okay.  Then, Chairperson just perhaps just to close on the previous presentation I just asked the team here to just put that slide on.  Can you put it on?  Just for the visual impression of those levels in context that is what wasthe spend of TNA through the GCIS system.Everybody else is in that big pie and so on.  So when we were having this discussion you see because Chairperson part of the narrative out there is that whatever was paid on TNA was like irregular.  There is no such a thing.  Everything – all processes were followed and all of that.  There is nothing irregular there.  So the impression created that if you spend one cent you spend one cent too much.  That approach is really misguided.So we need to just be clear that all of this is money that was – there was value derived for that money but at the same time when people pretend as if TNA captured GCIS is actually not true.  These are the only slivers that they got there.  This is information from GCIS.  So that one then Chairperson I just wanted to just flag.    That is the one that is on the statement, Chairperson.    Yes so I just wanted it here because I see here that the photocopier is black and white.  They do not have colour printers here.    Okay.    Yes that slide is done, Chairperson.  We can remove it.    Okay.  Then Chairperson as I close on IFMS I would have thought – I was really disappointed Chair.  I must say this by the attitude of National Treasury when I was asking for information and I say to them that I am not cominghere last minute because I am disorganised so to peak.I am coming to them last minute because I only knew last week that there will be further questions that I needed to ask and therefore I need more information so I tried to appeal to them to say this is in the interest of achieving the objectives.  Can you please give me this report which I want to use as an example and they threw all the red tape they can throw at me, Chairperson to say – I spoke to the spokesperson Jabulani Skhakhane.  He was saying to me no you must remember that you must go through the process and it is a 30 day process that you must go through in all this before we release this information and by the way, Chairperson having had the GCIS experience because I had the same kind of attitude when you are asking for information even 30 days later there is no guarantee that they will give you.They will come up with some clause that gives them the right not to give this thing to you and then you have to appeal to the Minister like I did at GCIS but this time around I could not appeal to the Minister because they have not refused. They have simply said we are still with our processes.  We cannot just give and all that.  So Chairperson I had to rely on the rules of the Commission Rule 6.1 which allows any evidence so to speak so I used that Rule 6.1 to bring the report because I do not want the Commission to be frustrated.The report is right here, Chairperson and this is from the whistleblower.  This is exact as it is so we will see 30 days later what happens but the report is here so that the work of the Commission is not frustrated by red tape.  I really would have thought that given the enthusiasm that National Treasury was on this place talking about this thing that they would say okay quickly here but they did not.  They did not want to give it to me but that is the situation.   The findings come.    That is where the fundings were, Chair.    Yes.    No.  This report, Chairperson is the one ...(intervenes).    Project from Treasury.    Tabled at SCOPA.    That is right, Chairperson.   This is the report.  This is where the R1.7 billion ...(intervenes).    There is nothing to show for it.    This is the detail right here.  So I will leave this copy.    Yes I am making – somebody can take it here.  There it is right here.   No, no.    I am leaving it here.    Then, Chairperson a very important point because we are talking about the capture here and I am going to wrap up, Chairperson.  It is my contention, Chairperson actually there has never been a time when the state had not been captured.  There has never been a time.  Not only has the state been captured, Chairperson even the laws have been captured and I am going to make a very quickexample.  Even the laws have been captured.  We have a very powerful and enabling clause in the Constitution of this country, Chairperson Section 217 that talks with the procurement.  That Section, Chairperson has got three sub Sections and the one Section talks to efficiencies you know everything about the Sections of everybody keeps quoting but there are other two Sections that nobody bothers about and the other two sub Sections for instance sub Section (2) says, let me just perhaps just to revise memories it is a very quick one, Chairperson.   Okay.   Well except that Chairperson those black businesses in town are faced with high rental costs because they do not own property, they have to lease that property and they compete with people that own the fixed buildings.  So that is a problem.  So you find that your cost items as black business in town are far higher than your next door neighbour.    Okay yes Chair ...(intervenes).    Yes.    Okay, yes Chairperson.    I was just using a quick example.    But it goes deeper this thing Chairperson, because thereis a whole lot of things because what you then do as well now that Chairperson seems to be interested in this there is also other things like things that affect your liquidity.  As black business your suppliers expect you to pay cash here and now.  The established businesses they do not have to do this.  They can pay 60 days later and all that.  Those are all the arrangements that enable them to do things in a much more competitive way.  Now ...(intervenes).    Yes and the Constitution recognised that and the Constitution said please put together a legislation that is going to cover that so that people are protected.  People are preferred, but then the legislation that we have seeks to create, seeks to treat unequal people equally.  That is what it seeks to do Chairperson and you appear like you will be asking for favours when you are trying to say but this is not fair.  The playing field is not the same.  The playing field is notlevel yet so we cannot have a situation where we are approached as if since 1994 we just switched on the light, everything is equal.  No the landscape is still very much skewed.  So we need to have an understanding of that.  So Chairperson without dealing with any specific issue the general principle that the products from black business for them to be a bit more, to have a bit of a premium is something that must be expected and it is something that the state which purports to be a developmental state needs to take that as a given that will have that issue, otherwise it really means that the black people must not be in business.    Okay.  Thank you Chairperson.  Then I move on thenChairperson to then just in line, just in keeping with my statement this is the last page Chairperson of my statement just to say that another company was appointed and it was meant to have submitted the report and on that day I do not know what happened, but bottom line ...(intervenes).    Yes Chairperson. Yes Chairperson.    I am just rounding off Chairperson.  Bottom line is that as things stand right now I saw a Tweet, you know, the Chairperson of SCOPA is very active on Twitter so he keeps live updates.  Although the first expectation was that on the 20th of November there would be that report but things happened between that company and National Treasury so the report did not happen, but on the 22nd of November I think last week Thursday then that report was given raw as it is.  I am sure National Treasury will still comment on it, but that report is there.  I think it will be interesting to see what those auditors, what that forensic audit has unearthedthere on that.So that wraps up that one then Chairperson just as an example of the kinds of things that made TNA and ANN7 unpopular because these are the things they cut both way.  It really means that National Treasury must think that we are attacking them as it were when in fact we want to do what Mr Pravin Gordhan said that we must root out the cancer wherever it is there.  So root out all the cancer.  So that is really what we thought we were doing there Chairperson.  So I move on Chairperson this is another critical story about the white collar capture of the state.  This is classic what I am going to describe to Chairperson now.  This is classic stuff that to try and find illegality and unlawfulness in this thing, the struggle, is elegantlydone.  It starts off somewhere and this is what we reported on.  It starts off somewhere in November 2006 with a very innocent memo which I put as Exhibit 9 on pages 261 to 271.So this memo from SARS Chairperson is a very interesting memo.  This memo seeks to sanitise the appointment of a particular service provider at SARS in 06.  So in a nutshell what happens here is that the bid, this company gets brought in not through open tender process and some argument gets made about emergency and all that and therefore regulation 16(a)(6.4) gets invoked which talks to it is not practical to go on an open tender.So this company gets appointed and part of the reason used is that it is cheap when others were quoting R300-something million or R400 million this particular company was saying they can do this thing for R100 million.  So then it sort of like make sense okay R100 million and we need this thing here now and all of this let us just get on and get this company on board.  So, and the person that makes recommendation, part of the officials of SARS that makes therecommendation instead of having a bid evaluation or a Bid Adjudication Committee even for the handful that were selected the person says in my opinion I think we should invite this one, this one, this one.  So the opinion counted instead of a proper committee that is supposed to do this.  So one man decides that in my opinion we must do – we must only look at this one, this one, this one.  So and the first one said I am not interested.  The other one said about R400 million or something and this one said R100 million and said okay, this is our horse, we take this one.Now the point here Chairperson is that what has since happened since the installation of this company and I am deliberately leaving names out because I am here to deal with the principle not to lambaste people.  I am here to deal with theprinciple but all the details are here Chairperson.  If the Commission wants names mentioned I will take direction from the Commission but I am leaving them deliberately.  The names are here.  This company starts off at a R100 million and then what then happens since then to date this company has been getting its participation renewed internally no processes involved. By 2016 already this company was racking in a billion Rand.  This is the one that started subtlety at one million and all processes to make it in terms of the Constitution, in terms of PFMA, cost effectiveness, openness and transparency and all that none of that.  Internally this thing would get renewed, renewed, renewed.  So what you have now I think now if you look at the IT bill of SARS I am told it is sitting at something like R8 billion, but this company is probably 1,5 or something of that.  I have not got that number, the fresh number as it is, but it is in that astronomical figure as things stand right now.  So what does this mean Chairperson?  Now what we have this company plays a very important role in that it is involved in e-filing and all that.  So now if you are to say this company must go on an open bid now andstop everything maybe somebody else a very solid argument is going to be made about how this is going to disrupt the collection of taxes and therefore you have a company that is there, that came in through ways that are not so transparent but now this company you cannot dislodge it as things stand.  It is almost a real risk now to dislodge this company and that is what I call white collar corporate capture of the state, because you then begin to understand Chairperson why even PFMA, PFMA it incentivises service providers that have got sort of government experience.So what you find with PFMA is that if you are a new player PFMA is not friendly to you.  PFMA is friendly to somebody who has got a foot in the door.  So even if I was to have a state of the art IT company today, but my chances of biddingagainst this particular company at SARS are zero because this company is going to argue that they have already got the territory, everything is smooth, to take them out will cause so much disruption.  Someone is going to work out how much confidence will be lost in the system and systemic risk and all of those things will be argued.So you now have a company that is going to be entrenched like that, Chairperson.  So that is the situation that you find there, Chairperson.  So this is the things that TNA and ANN7 report on and obviously we can see it cuts both ways.  Private sector does not like this that we keep exposing some shenanigans that they do in collaboration with some of these state departments as it were.  So that is it Chairperson.  I mean even as we speak now I am told that this company is now being used to provide services on other departments.So what we have now we have SARS as almost an agent so other companies do not have to go bidding.  They ask SARS that we know we have got a good IT system.  So SARS has now become some kind of a broker.  They now service other departments and the other departments paying to SARS, SARS paysinto this company.  That is the network that is in place so that for me, Chairperson is the blueprint of white collar corporate capture of the state that really we need to be dealing with and by the way Chairperson some of us when we make these points people think we are deflecting from Guptas.No.  If Guptas, we must put this very clear Chairperson, if Guptas are found to have done anything untoward, anything that is wrong the full wrath of the law must be – they must suffer the full wrath of the law but the law must not have eyes.The law must be blind.  The law must apply to all malfeasance wherever it rears its ugly head.  We cannot have – we cannot turn a blind eye on some of thesethings and also Chairperson the reason I am raising this I am not digging up stuff of pre 1994.This is current stuff as we are sitting now that IMFS, Chairperson is going to go this route.  Once that system is embedded in the state no other service provider will be able to ever walk in there.  Those that are there through the IMFS have embedded themselves for lifetime.That is how it is going to be.  So that is the white collar corporate capture that I am talking about.  So that concludes my issues around why TNA was ...(intervenes).    Yes, Chairperson, was hated by everybody.  So the rest of the liquidation thing is well covered in the affidavit.    Mr Maleka will ask whatever he wants to ask.  I am not going to go through that but then I have got two other questions – issues quicklyChairperson which are also emanating from the questions.    The one thing, Chairperson is the issue around the Standard Bank affidavit which has been put here as to that talks to what was I doing basically at the IMC ...(intervenes).    Yes.    Yes, that one.   So Chairperson I have put an affidavit to this matter and in the affidavit I point out that I actually attended the meeting at the directive/request of the Minister.  I was the Advisor to the Minister when this was happening, part time Advisor at that. I was an Advisor to the Minister so I went there as an Advisor.  So the question is I must relate what transpired in that meeting.  I think that request, Chairperson borders on being unlawful in this way.  You see Chairperson if you – there are two groups of people in a meeting.There are meeting participants.  There are people that are in attendance.  If I go to a board meeting in the board meeting you could have the board members.  If they say the quorum of the board meeting is five people and you have brought – you have invited all other departmental people there can be 20 in that meeting.If the quorum is five board members and you have got two board members notwithstanding that you have got 20 attendees that meeting is not correct. That meeting will not happen.  So to then ask an attendee of a meeting to relate what happened in the meeting is just not making sense because also what you say carries nothing, carries no weight because first and foremost I am not a spokesperson of the IMC.So I have no mandate to be dealing with that.  If the Commission is interested what really happened there the Commission and Chairperson who is known and the Chairperson was reporting to Cabinet.  In fact what I have done there Chairperson in support and just to show this point on Exhibit 11 page 273 to 274 I have shown – I have brought here a Cabinet statement.  I only have got two pages.  I have highlighted 4.7 of these two pages.   Okay.    Okay.    I am only ...(intervenes).   Okay.    Okay.  Okay, no Chairperson I think because it also happened, I do not know a while ago.  All I can remember it was a decorum of the meeting.  The meeting had a very good decorum.  There was no screaming at anybody and the meeting was a proper meeting, exchange of views and whatever.Discussion happened.  The details are contained in the minutes of the meeting which the secretariat can provide I think if asked.    That is all.    And then the last point, Chairperson ...(intervenes).   Then the last point part of the documents I was given what is commonly referred to as the Gupta leaks and so on.  Now Chairperson I just needed to understand something on this thing.  I must first be clarified in this.  Except for the one email that is there – except for the one email in January 2011 where there was an invite but that invite in the list of the things that was given there is a spreadsheet of people that were invited.  This was an invite to the India versus South Africa or of India and South Africa friendship of 150 years that was happening at KZN.But in that spreadsheet I was invited in my capacity as BMF not asPresident of the BMF not as government and so on.  The rest of the other emails that are there are emails when I was not in the public service.  I was not in GCIS and so on.  I was not in government.  Now I am perplexed Chairperson as to what is actually going on here.  Here am I a business person, a private sector person sending emails or receiving emails or whatever with another private sector person. No government involvement is mentioned there, absolutely nothing.  It is just justified to characterise it briefly Chairperson it would be an email talking about room allocation.  I do not even know the people that were dealing with those rooms.  Some operational matter about no let us arrange rooms for them but if I look at the timing and everything it was during the wedding.  I have always been on public, Chairperson to say I attended the Gupta wedding.It was never hidden that point.  I see – I saw nothing wrong then.  I see nothing wrong today and so on.  If they were to invite me tomorrow to another wedding I would still go and so on.  So for me there is no issue attending a wedding and then if it is not a wedding then it would be maybe a CV that can be linked tohave come from me and so on but even that Chairperson we do this all the time in the private space to send CV's of people around helping people to look for jobs and so on.I have not understood why is this – what is the context of this but this is what Mr Maleka has been explaining and as I close I just want to say something but as I close Chair I also wanted because the impression that I have is that this Commission is supposed to be impartial, fair and make sure that everybody is treated equally.Now one of the things I just found very strange is that in these leaks Chairperson one thing that is not shown is what I have.  Like for instance this picturehere it is in the exhibit ...(intervenes).    I think it must be in the bundle there, Chairperson.  Did you find it there?  Yes it is in the bundle there, Chairperson.    This picture it might – maybe somebody ...(intervenes).    Can I just ask the Registrar to take it to the Chair there?    Now this picture Chairperson as you are going through it has got Advocate Thuli Madonsela with the Guptas.  Now this ...(intervenes).    This picture is not featured in the emails that are featured.  Maybe I am trying to understand the fairness of this process here Chairperson that here am I a former government person and I am being followed about where I send emails and I do not send emails.Advocate Thuli Madonsela would have been sent an email to invite her to this thing.  But I am not understanding that she is here to explain as to why did you get an email from the Guptas but everybody else must answer this Chairperson. Where is the levelling of the playing field from this Commission?    Yes.    Well Chairperson my approach in the issues affecting anyone in this country is that South Africa is a Constitutional democracy.  SouthAfrica is a rule of law country.  I mean I was astounded when Ms Barbara Hogan said to me I was at Eskom when I was not at Eskom as an example, Chairperson.    Well my answer is I do not know.    Yes and Chairperson let me just finish then, Chairperson.    You see I was very hopeful Chairperson when the Estina Project was brought before the courts in Bloemfontein.  I was really hoping.  I thought that was an open/close case and so on, but when the state lost its case there I was not sure anymore as to what is going on here and ...(intervenes).    And that was a civil case.    So therefore Chairperson I do not know where this isgoing to end up.    Because when the State went there it went there I think with a lot more confidence than what I have seen here.  People that I have seen here I think Chairperson I must even if I have got to say so myself I must take the cup in terms of producing documentary evidence of things that I am talking about and people that have been here have been very poetic Chairperson without producing evidence and so I just do not know if we can just implicate people purely based on poetry.People came here and they spoke, they spoke, they spoke, they spoke.  Iwas really hoping that they are going to do something similar to what I am doing.  It might not be the best but I have tried Chairperson to listen to your counsel when you say people must bring evidence to corroborate.  I tried to do that.    I did not find it here Chairperson so I am struggling.    To convict people ...(intervenes).    Based on poetry.    I think Chairperson it is important that maybe some of us that are not in the legal profession these things get explained.    In that there are two things for me.  You can either be mentioned or implicated.  For me I draw a line.  You can be mentioned, they have been mentioned here but to be implicated for me is a step higher than being mentioned.  So to be implicated there must be corroborating evidence to say indeed you did this.  So for me that is implication.  So that is what I am saying I struggled to find evidence to corroborate the oral evidence that people were giving here.    No, in and out.  I have been listening and not listening because sometimes I would come and listen here and be very frustrated that my whole morning is gone and I am not seeing any evidence.  People are just talking and talking and talking.  So maybe out of that frustration maybe when I left they produced something, but most of the times that I was here I was just seeing people giving us theoretical perspectives on matters and all that.  So I do not have, I mean as I sit here now this is, I am speaking under oath. I sit here and now I cannot point to any piece of evidence that anybody here put on this table, but I know a lot of lyrics that have waxed on everything, but ...(intervenes).    I – two things, yes I accept that happens, but I also think the Commission must not take it for granted that we are glued on TV and readingnewspapers.  For instance I do not buy newspapers just on principle, because of the amount of distortions that they have to correct people all the time.  This morning on Twitter for instance being here I make a clear statement of reading from the internal audit report that whatever point I was making and then you have a journalist here twisting that and saying that was a SCOPA observation or something and yet I was very clear that these were the findings of the internal audit report.  So I have lost confidence in the newspapers.  I do not buy, I do not read newspapers.    I think it is important to contextualise that.  I was written a letter, I was told that on the 31st of August she is going to be here.  So I had a vested interest in that particular case, yes, but I do not get letters from the Commission every day to listen to everybody.    Yes.    Do I have reason to doubt?    Yes I have reason to doubt.    Let me start with the first one.  I will come to that one.    Yes I have reason to doubt.    I did not listen to Mr Nene's one, but I listened to these two.    No.    That is where I struggled actually.  I came very excited.  I booked off the whole day to listen to Minister Gordhan because I thought because he was the Minister of Finance he is going to have tangible information, paper trail and all that.  I struggled, I sat here and I listened and I listened and I lost concentration to be honest.    I think by definition it means if you have lost concentrationyou cannot hear as effective.    Okay ...(intervenes).   Okay Chair thank you for that Chair.  I will listen when he does that.    Yes partly.    About Mr?    About the phone call or something?    Yes I heard that part.    Yes.   Well yes I do.    Because I would have thought, you see, I could start from the beginning the three people that I say I have reason to doubt so that it is clear.  For instance let us start with Mr Maseko.  He said the President said (African language phrase) Gupta.  Now in other words and the Chairperson was very clear to explain that statement bullet by bullet what it means that help these Gupta brothers so to speak.  Now I was a DG myself.  So Ministers because they are public repsthey are the face of the department.  They are the chief face of the department.  So people interface with Ministers, people interface with the President because these are the people that go on the ballot box.So people go to them naturally to say I need this, I need that and the Presidents and the Ministers do not have the apparatus.  The only thing they can point to is to the DG and the DG must then point the people to processes that must be followed and all that.  I mean if Mr Maseko had said that the President said to him I do not care about what processes that must be followed and all that.  I did not hear him saying this.  He just said help.  So that would have been said to me by a number of people or Ministers to say help these people and we would call the people in, you explain to them how the process works, that is helping the people.  So that is what – that is my understanding, but the characterisation of that request was a characterisation that could lead to only one and one conclusion only that the President was sort of getting him to do something that was unlawful.  So that is why I do not, I have doubts about the rest of everything else.Mr Jonas for instance he makes a claim that he makes and the next thing he is not even clear who actually did this.  At one point he says it is Mr Ajay Gupta, then he is not clear, then somebody else, then I am not sure if what is this thing and so on and by the way part of the disturbing thing Chairperson which is in the public domain is that they were in some hotel and then they drove with Duduzane.  I am saying to myself why does the Deputy Minister leave his bodyguards and everybody and drive with this young chap on a car to some place that he said he is not even familiar with this place.So all those kinds of things they just leave you wonder as to what exactly was at play here.  So things like that Chairperson for me they just are things that Ijust do not understand.  So I cannot vouch for people that have got those kinds of what I think are gaps in their depositions.    Yes ...(intervenes).    I was punished for that.    This punishment started I think around 2017.  In fact as I come into TNA you will see that it is in my affidavit that I came into a loss making conversation.  It was already bleeding.  This thing was bleeding something like R5 million per month roughly and I thought I was going to stem the tide and my biggest preoccupation with this Chairperson was the big thing for me was to savejobs.  That stable had employed 500 people and I thought if I replace the Guptas there I can save those 500 jobs, but it was not to be.  As we sit here and now 500 people are without a job and something in my view that could have been prevented.  So it is a very sad state of affairs.If somebody had a problem with a Manyi or the Guptas that should have been dealt with but the business should not have been undermined which was providing an alternative view in the media space which was providing employment to a whole lot of young people mainly black.  So I really think that was a tragedy Chairperson to have lost that business.    Yes.  Yes, so Chairperson I am happy you raised this because this thing has got dates.  When we did the IFMS report this happened around May/June 2017 as it were.  This is when the height of hatred began actually around that time around May 2017, because the system works in collaboration Chairperson you then have a situation where the whole business model which Mr Maleka wanted to – is alluding to in his questions as to what is a business model, the business model was both private and government.  So the private sector people they are very – they hunt like a pack Chairperson.  You mess up with one you have messed up with all of them.  So when they saw how we report on this, but because they know some of them are doing these things elsewhere so they say now these people are not good because they are the people that are exposing our secrets.  So let us shut them down and so on.So that started to – and in fact they create – what then happened Chairperson they create such a frenzy around the New Age, such a stigma because then there is a whole cabal of four big media companies that inform the narrative of this.  So they paint this narrative, the stigmatise TNA such that even Ministers get harassed in Parliament how much money do you spend with TNA?  Now Ministers, members of Parliament even at a Provincial level were beginning to be uncomfortable now because of this because you have got the DA on that side and that is also anti some of the transformation messages that this media house represents.  So therefore because they have created this monster called the Guptas they have created this monster.  So they want to know who is dealing with thismonster.  Now if this was such a monster Chairperson the question is why is it that National Treasury still had it in its systems, because really if this was such a rogue activity by this public – this house it should have even qualified to have been on the Treasury system and all that, because it is something that is doing things that are wrong, but because at a factual level there was no substance to all this.  This was all just a media hype designed to kill an alternative view, designed to entrench a mainstream narrative.  This is what they did.    Chairperson I think it is an unfair request this way.  Let me give an example.  It is an unfair request because let me give an example.  One ofthe questions given here is where you interviewed?  Now if the answer is yes or no then I am going to say no I was not interviewed then media goes out there with the headline Manyi got the job without an interview when in fact the truth of the matter is that the interview issue does not arise because I was transferred.  So a yes and no answer can be very misleading.    Okay.  Thank you, Chair.    Okay.    Yes but at the same time, Chair there are loaded questions.  I think let us just be alive to that.  Sometimes ...(intervenes).    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.  Thank you, Chair.    I beg, you disappeared there.  They were what in their reporting?    Is that in term so the mainstream?    No.  That was just 10% of the issue.  The rest of the issue with the mainstream media is that most of the time they get things wrong.  They get things wrong most of the time.  So one could not – one cannot place reliance Chairperson on what you see in the media.  It is wrong all the time.  Most of the time it is wrong.    I do not know what you are talking about.    You are saying critical mistakes?    Yes?    Okay yes.   The answer, Chairperson is that no, the issue was not because they were critical of the state.  The issue was not they were getting their facts right.  The state is always open to criticism but the issue is that when they criticise they criticise using wrong information.  That is the problem.  That is what we do not like about it.    Yes, Chairperson.   Yes.  No, here is the issue, Chairperson.  The IFM one is an example.  The story was broken by our group.  It was broken by TNA and ANN7 and the length and not only did the story get broken on hearsay and whatever.  It was broken and broadcasted on using tangible information from this same audit report I just dropped off here and what would happen in the media space, Chairperson?When is others – when it is others when they do their thing whatever they do there is some kind of collaboration of sorts then you would just find that all the newspapers are pretty much saying the same thing and what have you.  So we were not part of that part.  So what then – what that does is that it then diminishes the impact of what you are trying to say because they do not want to report what wereported on not that we needed to be done that way but then what they then do when they do their own reporting then they just find ways sometimes to if they like a particular department then they will find ways to find a positive spin of things.So with us what we were doing – what The New Age and ANN7 was doing was to try and report things very sharply whether it is right or wrong.  When it is right we really heap praises on it.  When it is wrong we do what we do and we do not try to be the spokesperson of various departments.    Yes?    Yes I have got.    Yes.    Yes, that is correct.    No not correct.  194 I indicated.    Yes.   Yes.    Can I interject Chair?    Can I just quickly interject to say that I know the things that he is talking about but those things don’t work as well as perhaps Mr Maleka think they do.  An example is what the Chair has just said, that is an example, the very – I mean if you can’t trust a Judge to say here – who is anybody else, if you can’t say a Judge says, and the Judge is even in a position of authority, a Judge is saying here is a recording, at least listen to this and compare it with what you have written.  Same thing Chairperson the front page of the Sunday Times would have a picture of some palace in Dubai, and they say it’s President Zuma’s and then thenext time that same palace has got a different owner and they have never gone back to apologise to President Zuma that the palace that they said he owns is actually not true ja and so on, but they carry on like this and they get away with it because they’ve got the monopoly of the space.  This is the challenge that we are facing.    H’mm.    It’s right there.    R8 778.      Again Chairperson if I may interrupt?    Again you see Mr Maleka is almost like becoming like how journalists report stuff, he is now coming up with the Sun bite which totally out of context, he is now having – I have explained that the psychographics of the Daily Sun although it’s got a big circulation but people that would not – I made an example of it’s not where you would put an analysis of a particular judgment because the market does not do that, so therefore – and I have been at pains to explain that the actual numbers are meaningless, it’s a mechanical process.  The issue is target marketing.  Who are you targeting?  Where are those people that you are targeting?  Which publication is very appropriate for who you are targeting?  This is what counts in this space.    Thank you Chair.    That is the?    I’m there.    No, no, the end of your question.    Was a daily publication, yes …(intervenes).    It is shut down now.    Yes.    Chairperson, I – what is the right word?  We can do this the whole day; the answer is the same that Mr Maleka has taken a mechanical approach and I have been explaining that things are not as mechanical as you reach them to be.  I have explained that there is a bit more sophistication in deciding where the ad should go.  There is something called target marketing and all that.It may very well be that TELMA would have told the people otherwise, the ones that are placing the ads, so this is an outcome of largely what TELMA does, but it is more than that Chairperson.  Not only does GCIS follow TELMA.  GCIS also had a transformation mandate for instance.  There are many of the publications that evenon the programming of TELMA they will not feature, but GCIS is an organisation with a strategy on media development and diversity, had a duty and a responsibility to make sure that the support media other than – over and above mainstream media it supported everybody including mainstream media.It cannot be that GCIS is expected to just support all others, except those that do not have big names, it cannot be.    Yes, Chair.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay, yes, Chairperson, because I understand what is wrong about that, because usually when things are new people embrace them.  So TNA brought fresh …(intervenes).    People embrace new things, so if TNA was new people were having a first embracement of wow, for a change now here is a publication that is different, that is not going to be riddled with all kinds of factual inaccuracies.  Imean even today as I showed you The Star, why did The Star have my picture on assets that I have nothing to do with and so on.You know, so it just shows, Chairperson, the kind of media that we have.  Now if we have something fresh, must have been welcome, and by the way, Chairperson, as I make this point is that GCIS cannot take the blame for being briefed by government departments.What Mr Maleka should be asking is who are the government departments that did this, because GCIS, Chairperson does not have its own budget?  Let this be very clear.  The only budget that GCIS has and I think Mr Maseko explained this, is really just to pay for staff and all that.  There is no – if there is anything, probably at best be something that we would get from …(indistinct), if other departments did not spend and so on and you are trying to make sure that money goes into good use.  That is about the only time that GCIS would do anything creative like advertisement or something, but otherwise GCIS is a conveyor belt.  It carries out mandates from different government departments.So you cannot have a situation where GCIS must now answer why did monitoring and evaluation or why did Public Works or why did anybody like that …(intervenes).    I think what, Chairperson, the contention of Mr Maleka fails to appreciate is that …(intervenes).    Yes, I acknowledge that.    Yes.    But I think it was justified.  It is justified, because I suspectthat, because government was generally frustrated by this factual inaccuracies, when a new player came it was a relief that for the first time now maybe things are going to be reported correctly and all that.  I think it was the freshness that was brought in that got people to say, I think this is the place to go and so on.So I think the important thing, Chairperson, in all of this is, was there value derived from this?  You see for me that is the issue and …(intervenes).    Chairperson, I do not want to speak …(intervenes).    Yes.    Chairperson, there are two issues.  One is the TELMA, two is the transformation agenda of government.  Government is very serious, has always been very serious about transformation.  So when – I mean as I said, Chairperson, that government has even set up a whole subsidiary MDDA to try and make sure that alternative media is supported.  There is a whole organisation just to focus on this, it just shows how serious the issue is.Then you have a player that comes in line with that strategy, so government then would have looked warmly towards that.  I mean I have read outhere the letter by Ms Williams in 2013 when she was explaining this thing that government had to use all available platforms.  All of these other platforms were also being used, but this one was used in line with what TELMA was saying coupled with the transformation agenda.If you look, Chairperson, I think at some point there are even targets of the government spent, there was a deliberate strategy to say the 30% of spend should go towards community media.  That is a deliberate strategy.  So you would then if you look at the analysis of that and you look at the media strategy that is being spent, you will find these kinds of what appears to be anomalies, as it were, when in fact it is the execution of the developmental agenda.If you do not do that, Chairperson, then you are paying lip service to the transformation agenda.    I am easy, Chairperson.    Chairperson, I need to qualify this answer.  I was not personally involved in these things.  There as a Chief Director doing – I was indeed in charge of the entire GCIS.  All departments reported to me, it is not just media buying, all of them they reported to me, including the one that was doing all kinds of irregular things.  They all reported to me, Chairperson, but on a day to day I was not personally involved.The Chief Director Donald Dubuc was a guy and before him it was somebody else at a Director level, but there are individuals that do this on a day to day basis as you were to implement a strategy.  So it is incorrect to try and now make this a Manyi thing.It is not a Manyi thing, it is a government strategy being implemented by people best qualified to do it.    Yes, I said that.    I thought it was an understood convention, it means yes.    No, Chairperson, he is saying I am shaking my head, I had nodded.    So I said I thought nodding is a convention understood to mean yes.    Yes, he should have said so, Chairperson, but he did not say that.  He says that he does not understand.    No, incorrect.  What is correct, Chairperson is that TNA was using audited figures, but the difference is by who?  It was not using the ABC figures which the mainstream media was using.  It was using auditors to audit the figures.  That was what was happening.    Correct.    Ja, TNA was using audited figures.  I am not understanding the follow up question, because I did answer this question.  I am not understanding what is lacking with the answer.    Yes, we are agreed on that.    Ja, once again, Chairperson, I think again Mr Maleka is putting the mechanical ahead and I keep saying that the ABC figures, the circulation figures are just a cold number with no brain, just a cold number, no thinking involved.  It is just to say how many people and all that.Now when you are doing placements you got to use a bit of sophistication to take into account the kind of psychographics that we are also looking at.  Not just cold numbers.  So TELMA would do a bit of that, but we would have to also use a bit of – because we have got professionals there who are not just going to take everything and lap it as is.  You then need to put a bit of qualitative aspects as wellthat are informed by what it is that a particular department is saying should be – is being targeted.  The actual target group that is being targeted.    ABC.    I do not agree, Chairperson.    I do not agree, Chairperson.    I do not agree, because it is again the thing of being mechanical.  The fact that you have a particular circulation which means that you have got a particular purported number of people who lay their hands on that newspaper, does not address the purpose of why every person – a particular department wants to put an add in a particular paper.The departments they put ads not because they are bored, they put ads, because they want to communicate a particular message to certain people to say we want this message to go to this target market as it were.   Chairperson, let me just make this example.   If you – I also have a car industry background, I used to work for Toyota at one point.  Now they each have one of their small cars at that time called Toyota Tazz.  Now you can sell 100 Toyota Tazz, 100 what will be paid to you for selling 100 Toyota Tazz would be miniscule of what would be paid to somebody selling a Rolls Royce but both of you are selling cars.So therefore to look at just purely how many Tazz's I produced when in fact somebody is talking about a Rolls Royce, you are actually comparing incomparables.    But we are all selling cars.    Ja, Chairperson, I think we are probably going to go around in circles.    Yes, okay, the point, Chairperson, is that if you would thengo and even interrogate actually how those numbers are arrived at and then you would come to a very clear conclusion that even the reliability of these numbers that are so called audited is another kettle of fish, because even those numbers it is not like it is gospel.  It is not even gospel even in those numbers, Chairperson.What people do they take a whole bundle of newspapers, they go and give them to a company and you go to any company, Chairperson, and you will find bundles and bundles of newspapers left at the reception area, nobody reads them, but those newspapers would be counted as part of the circulation as it were.So whether how many eyes actually get to them is another story.  So even those numbers are actually cooked.  So you cannot sign your life on ABC numbers, that would be irresponsible.    No, there is no law that says so.    I beg your pardon?    No, but you said part and parcel of the law.  There is no law, there is no law that says that you must use TELMA.    This is a tool, Chairperson, that we are using to try and make sure that the outcome is somewhat objective.  If where Mr Maleka is leaning towards was correct it would mean that for all the community media that we have spent on, that is irregular expenditure, which is not the case.So you can spend, you do not need TELMA for everything.  You need TELMA for certain and others, you do not have to use TELMA necessarily, but we use TELMA just to try and say to departments that we do here is informed by some level of objectivity as it were, but using or not using TELMA is not in the Treasury regulation.    The departments, Chairperson, are doing that as we speak.  In fact GCIS is struggling.  I do not know now, but I can even show you that even now newspapers, yes, they do that – most departments they go directly.  The 194 number let us look at these years that I was involved.  I think more than double that number, Chairperson was placed directly outside GCIS.My biggest struggle was to get everybody to come into GCIS and departments had their own relationship, they did not have TELMA.  They do not have TELMA even as we speak, but even decisive today, I am sure there could still be a few departments that have got direct relationships.  So yes, no, TELMA is not a regulated tool, no.   GCIS is a government department.  The same rules.  There are no different rules for GCIS.  We are all governed by the same rules.  Yes, so if other government departments can place media directly without using GCIS and TELMA and they are not red carded, you cannot red card GCIS for not using TELMA.And as I say, Chairperson, with the community media in particular TELMA does not even feature.  So, and there is no irregularity there.    Yes, Chairperson, it is not binding.  I mean sometimes …(intervenes).    Yes, Chairperson, I mean you would go and tell the department this is what the system says, but the department, some of those departments with relationships with media directly they would insist, and GCIS did not have veto powers, this is another problem.GCIS does not have veto powers.  If a DG from another department, it is his money, he says you shall place this with Sunday Times, even if I say, but TELMA says put it with City Press and he says I said Sunday Times.  So what you then do, because what we are all about is economies of scale, then you would look at how many other Sunday Times in the system and everything.So when you go to Sunday Times to bargain for a price you then go therewith a bigger number and you try and negotiate a price down, that is as far as you can do.    Yes, Chairperson, I am here.    07
MR ZWENELE MANYI:  Ja, Chairperson I think the reason I brought this list here so people can see how much is spent.  I want to challenge let’s say this house Tiso Blackstar I don’t know how much, how many millions they are getting now but in 12/13 they got like R28 million.  I want to challenge Tiso Blackstar to say Government must not do business with them, just three months Chairperson, I guarantee you this place will shut down, just three months, it will shut down.  So what Mr Maleka is saying I don’t think he understands the impact of the slice of Government in anything, even this house which has got both business from government and elsewhere but at least from GCIS and in fact that R28 million that they got in 2012 as Tiso Blackstar is just the one part, the rest of other Government Departments that do direct business with them the figure could easily be R100 million.  Let Government not give them that amount just three months Chairperson I guarantee you this will shut down.    You said here tomorrow?    No, no I thought we were going to finish today.    Just before that Chair can I just briefly address just the intro that he had given, because I think that intro is incorrect.      It’s incorrect in that he says just the one entity, GCIS is notjust the one entity, it’s a conduit, when you say GCIS you must see the entirety of Government, or this part of Government.    Bringing to GCIS, so you can’t have some kind of a preoccupation that that 194 is government – is GCIS budget, GCIS has got almost zero budget, it’s just a conduit, so all that money is money from different departments as it were, so that must be very clear.    231?    Yes.    18 yes.    Yes.     Yes.     No, I think the City Press probably constitutes a part of 90% of this number, that’s the publication that we’re dealing with here.  So all these other things like they would have – whether whatever magazines they have and so on is not the kind of publication that Government was doing.  The main publication was City Press, so this I’m almost sure Chairperson that about 90% plus was City Press.    Ja, those are GCIS figures.   Yes.     Yes.     H’mm.    Chairperson there’s a context to this.    I think pretty much like the Chairperson was pointing out I think Mr Maleka is comparing apples to pears this way.  City Press is a weekly publication and the TNA was a daily publication, Monday to Friday, and TNA was not only a national newspaper, it had its national and it also had provincial publications on a daily basis.  So to compare a day to day national newspaper with a weekender, one day in a week, is not a correct comparison.   Can I respond to that Chair?    Now I don’t understand what Mr Maleka where is going to Chairperson because that may be the case, what’s wrong with that if what was – because even Ms Williams when she was here she explained the TELMA., now what happens if this kind of things that departments were looking for required the New Age, this is what drives where we place those papers.  GCIS is not some social development department that is seeking to spread things equally to a whole range of newspapers, no, it’s not about that, so as to how much each newspaper eventually got is really neither here nor there.  What is important is what were in the business plans, what was their campaign that the departments were putting up, and when youput those campaigns and the …(indistinct) targeted into the TELMA system what did the TELMA system point out.     And I am contesting that Chairperson because I think his approach is very mechanical, mechanical in that he is looking at the size of the City Press and the process is not mechanical, it’s a bit more scientific, the process is more like target marketing.  Now it may very well be just like I said Daily Sun willhave the biggest circulation, but does it have the kind of market that we are looking for?  Yes or no, you know, so it’s not as mechanical as the biggest gets the biggest so to speak, the issue is at that specific point in time what was the campaign that was being run, what were the audiences that were being targeted and etcetera, and what did the system say.  I think the only discussion we should be having on this matter is whether despite what the system said we went and we put something different, that’s the only credible discussion we can have on this, otherwise this is not going to take us anywhere Chairperson because the issue at hand is that GCIS is informed by TELMA, so if TELMA says the most appropriate and relevant newspapers for this kind of a campaign is the New Age, that is the most objectiveway that we can put into court.
