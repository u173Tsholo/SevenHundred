CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Soni, good morning everybody.     Good.  Good morning Mr Montana.  .You want to make sure that I do not hear you that is why you do not put on your mic.    Alright okay.  Okay thank you for coming back okay let us continue but maybe before we continue Ijust want to tell you Mr Montana I asked the legal team to look at all the concerns that you have raised with the commission and bring them to my attention so that we can look at them – each one on its merits.  Okay alright.     Oh I think we must just do the oath again.    I think you were but just in case.  Alright.    Do have any objection to taking theprescribed oath?    We cannot hear you I am sure – ja okay.  Go back and start afresh.    Do have any objection to taking the prescribed oath?    Thank you.  You may proceed Mr Soni.    Yes.    Yes no, no.    That is fine you will – you will attend to it.   Ja okay alright.    It is under Divider 6.    Oh okay.    Well I do not know whether that might bemeaning but I suspect that from his point of view he – he means if you resist something that Mr Montana wants you to do because you think it is wrong and you insist that things should be done properly you are crossing his path and I suspect that that is his meaning – the intention – the meaning he intends.    You understand it ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    But I guess also what you are saying based on your earlier response is somebody in his position could level the accusation when you as the superior at work say no this is wrong it should not be done and they believe it should be done they might describe that still asyou would see that from their side they in resisting something you believe is lawful that they would say you = you are abusing your powers when you act against wrongdoing.    You mean align themselves with Mr Molefe.    Ja.    And I guess others aligned themselveswith you.    ha.    Ja okay.    Okay I am sorry Mr Soni.      I am not sure you may have said this.  Prodigy the first entity that he wants to deal with is Prodigy Business Services.    Limited.    You may have mentioned it but…   For my record – for the record I just want to…    Show the record reflects that this is the first one (inaudible).    Okay alright.    He says – he does not say when – he says he resigned in 2012 Moodley.  He does not say when –     Oh he was appointed as a director fiveyears after the company was registered which would be 11.    Ja okay.  And resigned in – on 1 March 12.    You do not know when he became a director and when he resigned.    Ja.    Well that is very important.  I assume that the – the homework in terms of your affidavit has started.    Oh okay.    Ja.    Yes okay no that is fine because for example the last point that you made you – you made you know can be very important so it is important to see if there is any documentation that you attach and so on in support of it.   Okay alright.    Okay.    Hang on Mr Soni.  We – we all know that Mr Montana he has prepare an affidavit.    That is the affidavit that is the subject of the homework I was talking about a few minutes ago.    And I suspect that to help him respond to some of the allegations that is the affidavit he keeps onlooking at to see what he has got in it.  Now it may be that it would be convenient that if he responds to an allegation in – a certain allegation in 14.1 he should respond to it fully rather than saying I deny that on the basis that later he will give more information about it.  Because if we do it that way then in the transcript you find the whole response to a particular allegation in one place.    Rather than find a denial and then go somewhere else to find substantiation of that denial.  Whatdo you think of that?    Yes.  Yes.    Yes, yes.    What I was thinking is that the reason why his affidavit is not being used now it is because the issue of annexures must still be sorted out otherwise if that had been sorted out it would have been available to use.  But I think there is nothing – there is no problem if he tells me what is in the affidavit without the affidavit being – because that is his response.    You know.   So that is what I was thinking so that when the affidavit is filed one – one reads – one sees in it what he has already told – told us.    Yes, yes.  So – so let us try that Mr Montana so that your response to a particular allegation are not scattered all over.    Yes, yes.  Okay alright.    You were caught out.    You got caught.  No, no that is fine butthere is no problem if you tell me what is in the affidavit as your oral evidence.  What is not being done is give – give the affidavit to me before it is – it is completed in terms of annexures.  But in terms of telling me what is – what it is in it it is fine.  But I think – I think you should not tell me paragraphs for example to say in paragraph so and so in my affidavit I think do not – do not tell me the paragraph just tell me the story – your – what you have to say about a particular allegation.    Ja.    Yes.   Yes.    Okay.    ja.    Ja.     H’m.     H’m.     Was Ms Ngoye there at that time?     Okay.     I think you did not finish the point you wanted to make.  I think you have started making it.  Ithink you have wanted to say when you went on leave you recommended that she be ...[intervenes]      ...a Group CEO.     H’m.  Okay alright.       That is the training?     Ja.     Okay.  No, thank you.       [laughs]     [laughs]     Ja.  No, no I am happy, Mr Montana, that you are using the Commission to deal with whatever allegations that it made against you and to place before the Commission all the facts that as you know them as you believe the Commission should know because that is whatwe want.  That is what we want.  We are not here to want one side because we want a particular outcome.  I mean, if – you know, sometimes I do not understand some things that one in the newspapers about me and about the Commission.  If I want to make a findingagainst you, Mr Montana, how – what a bad person you are, the best way for me to do that is not to have you here giving me contrary evidence, giving me examples of what a good person you are.  The best thing is for me to grab the first opportunity when you indicate you do not want to come.  And you say okay, okay.  You do not come.  Because if I do it that way, the only evidence I will have is the evidence against you.  When I want you to come and tell your story, it does not make sense to say I want to find against you. What if you give me compelling evidence that the people are saying all kinds of things against you, are lying about you.     H’m.     [laughs]  Well, all I can tell you,Mr Montana, is that whenever findings I will make about anybody – I am not going to be dictated by whatever the public says about whatever happens outside the hearing.  It is going to be based – those findings will be based on the evidence that I have heard, you know.  And that – and Iwill be looking at all evidence that has been placed before me.  So you are doing the right thing by coming to the Commission, putting your side of the story so that, one, the public knows your side of the story.  Two, the Commission has your evidence.  Whatever the Commission might find in the end, you must be able to say but they did have my evidence.     Ja, okay alright.  Mr Soni.    I am sorry.  I did not hear the page,Mr Soni.     138.     Let us confirm that is 10 June 2010?    Ja, okay.     Yes.     Yes.  Can I just ask you, Mr Montana, to explain this proposal to me.  I am not sure that I asked anyof the witnesses that gave evidence previously.  Is the position that Prodigy approached the Services Seta ...[intervenes]      ...and was granted money?     Yes, but ...[intervenes]      You are told we are prepared to spend so much but we give the money but you will provideinvoices or whatever.     So granted money in that sense.     You do not get the cash but the effect ofthe decision of the Seta is.  You can go and train people in terms of learnerships to the value of this amount.     And you will be training them for them to get the following kind of training or qualification and you will be paid by the Seta.     Ja.     Yes.     Which they would have put aside for you.     Ja.     Ja.     Oh, okay.     Okay, okay, okay.  So – but in terms of this proposal, PRASA would not pay for the training.       Ja.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.    H’m.     But the money the Seta would have put aside in this case will be for the actual training?     Ja.  Now as far as the people who would be trained are concerned, would PRASA – would the cost that PRASA would incur relate to the actual training or to something incidental, like, paying for the venue or something like that?     Oh, okay.    H’m.     H’m?     H’m.  So the terms and conditions under which Seta would set aside X amount for Prodigy to do this training, would it be on the basis that if the Seta says ahundred rand per learner, for example, they are free if they agree with PRASA whatever – to charge more per learner and then PRASA tops up or they can only charge what the Seta – what they had agreed with the Seta?  I am just trying to see how come PRASA would still pay for the training.  I can understand if it is other expenses.  How come PRASA would still pay for actual training of the Seta has given this – is going to pay them for the training, Prodigy.     Oh, you – so you ...[intervenes]      To widen the scope?     Yes, yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.  So which, I guess, means that insofar as the first 300 are concerned ...[intervenes]      PRASA would not have paid anything inregard to the actual training.     But insofar as you widened the scope ...[intervenes]      ...then you will pay because that is not covered by the Seta.     Okay.  Now I understand.  Okay.  Mr Soni.    I am sorry.  And 300 funded learnership based on an amount to say 300 learners.     Ja, okay.     Do you know whether – I am sorry, Mr Soni.  Or let me first ask this question.  I take it that interms of how the SETAs operate, an employer such as PRASA is entitled to approach the relevant SETA and say I would like to have my stuff changed, can you make money available and then they can set aside some money with or without conditions.  Do you know whether that is true, thatis correct?     Okay.    Okay, okay, so normally as an employer you just go ahead and train people.     And then afterwards go to the SETA and say this is the training that I provided to my staff, here is proof, these are the expenses I have incurred to carry out that training.     And then in that case – well, I guess when you say there is formula they apply what – probably that means is that you do not get everything back in terms of your course.     Yes.     Yes, ja.     Oh. MR     Ja, okay, okay.  Thank you.  Mr Soni?     To say – because I think he has gone back to the affidavit.    Okay.     I am sorry, his signature is at what page?     Okay.       I am sorry, so the regime, as I understand it, which you I think you explained to me is inrespect of the 300 learners that Prodigy and the SETA agreed upon, Prodigy would not claim anything from PRASA in respect of the actual training but they would claim from the SETA because that is the arrangement.     Sorry?     Ja.    No, no, no, let us take it step by step.  I am saying based on what I understood you to say to me earlier on, as far as the first 300 learners are concerned, I think you did indicate that for the actual training Prodigy would be paid by the SETA.     That is Prodigy or PRASA?     Ja, yes.    Yes.     Yes, I understand that part, I am still looking at what it means for Prodigy and the SETA that this training has come about not because PRASA approached the SETA or PRASA decided to do the training itself and then claim but that it came about because of the arrangement between Prodigy and the SETA.     Ja.  So my earlier understanding of what you had said was that as far as the fees for Prodigy, if you can call them that, for the actual training, PRASA is notliable, the SETA is liable because of the arrangement Prodigy made with the SETA.  But, even in regard to that, those 300, PRASA can put in its own claim – we did not go into the details – something that it can get but when it came to the additional learners outside of the 300, I understood that PRASA would pay – would conduct the training or get whoever to conduct it for them and then spend the money but claim from the SETA.  But I think based on what you have just said, that understanding of mine might not be accurate.    Yes.     Ja.    So the process of Prodigy getting paid, how does it happen?  What is the route.     Ja.     Ja.     So when all is said and done is the position that whether an employer conducts the training of its staff itself without a third party or it brings in a third party, ultimately the cost of the training, the bill gets footed by the SETA minus whatever they employer will claim from the SETA.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.     Is the SETA then.     Yes, yes.    Yes, okay, okay.  No, thank you.  Mr Soni?     At the bottom, h’m.     177.     Yes.     You say I see that there are PRASA people who signed that, but I only see your signature.  Only your signature at 177.    Are you talking about another page?     Ja, yes.     Ja.     Okay, okay.    So you say there would have been a memo that accompanied the draft agreement?     Ja.     Ja.    Yes.     Well, I think what I would like you to deal with, the 300 learners, the first lot, what were they – what skills were they being trained on or – I want to compare that you later on tell me about the 3 000 becauseyou have said that it is different programmes, that is fine, but I want to know what actually – what were the actual skills, were they being trained on or qualifications or whatever, I just want to get that, you know, like this one was – they were being trained to drive cars or they have been trained.  When you get – when you are being trained to drive a car it cost 6 000 but when you are being trained to drive a train, that is 24 000, that is the difference, that is what I am looking at.     Yes.     Yes, yes, I accept that, ja.     So I guess customer service would like, you know, how important it is to smile when you serve a customer.     Or to follow up if there are complaints and so on.    Do not speak on the phone while you are talking to a customer, that kind of thing.     Ja.     Okay.     For the basic, for the 3 000.     Oh, the 300, ja.     Okay.     The people who would be eligible get onto the programme involving 3 000 compared to the categories of people who got onto the basic programme.  Were there categories to say, for example, for the basic one we need people who fall within the following categories or who have got these qualifications, maybeMatric, but maybe once you get to the second one, which is more expensive, we are looking at maybe some managers and so on.  Was there anything like that?     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, did you say or was it just an example that the duration of the best program that is the program involving the 300 was for the two weeks and this one for the 3000 was six months or was those just examples?    Did you do you recall the duration in regard to both or you do not remember?    Not off hand.     Ja, okay alright, Mr Soni.     …he had not joined PRASA?     Thank you.  ADV VAS SONI     Yes, sure.     Yes.     Ja, but the point you were making about value for money is you are saying, we have heard of situations where people are given contracts to build houses, and you will find that the money has been given to them, they have been paid but when you say where are the houses, they cannot show you the houses they built.  So you are saying whatever difficulties or challenges may be pointed out in regard to PRASA the onething that cannot be said, as far as you are concerned, is to say, but where is what was supposed to be done with the money, that is the point you were making.     Let us take the tea adjournment it isabout twenty minutes past we will resume at quarter to twelve.     We adjourn.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us continue.    I am sorry before you respond I just wantto make sure I understood the question.  Just repeat the question Mr Soni.    I am – I see that in – at page 173 there is a column there that says this is – this will be a ten day program conducted over a three to six month period eish then I must complete the program in a maximum of sixmonths.    Now is the question that that is not said in the contracts it should have been in the contract or is the question a different one?    Sorry.    Ja.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So it is not about where – where the point is made – where the issue is covered it is about whether it is clear or vague.    That is the only point okay.  Mr Montana.    Ja.    I will tell you what my initial understanding is Mr Soni and of course if it becomes a serious issue onecan look at it and so on.  I understand the theory – the five days of theory to be part of the ten days because they say this will be a ten day program.  So I understand that to say in total this program requires ten days.      So when in the earlier sentence they say the theoretical session is five days I take that to mean the ten day – the ten days is divided into two.  The theoretical session and maybe what I would call the practical session.    That is – that is my initial understanding.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.  Obviously Mr Soni is giving his understanding.    Yes.    Ja give us your understanding.    Well I – with what you have just said I am not sure that my earlier understanding as I articulated it is correct because you are saying to me the ten days mentioned here for the program is not the whole program.  You say it is one – maybe one activity there were many others.  So – so you say in other words you say this ten day program was one part of a larger program.    Ja.   But they say the theory is five days.  So it cannot – the theory cannot be for ten days.  Or at least this is what this says.    Yes what I – what my understanding was is that program over which should take ten days would have a    Yes.    What is going to be necessary because I think it is important particularly because I think Mr Soni was asking in order to assess the amount of R24 000.00 per learner in terms of – in relation to the content of the – of the training.  So it is going to be important that we have – I have a full picture.  So I do not know to what extent all the documentation that is here – to what extent thedocumentation we have here is everything to what extent there might be documentation as well it would help us understand and obviously if Mr Montana you have documentation at home that could assist that would help me – helpful. Because the difficulty I have at the moment with what you are saying is that it seems to me to be not in accordance with what he says but it may be that that is because I am looking at this document only.  Once I see other documents I might see the point you making.    In your – yes.    Yes.   Okay alright.    Oh I am sorry has he finished – have you finished your question?    Oh okay alright.   Yes, no, no that is fine Mr Soni will mention but as I understand your position it should notmatter from your point of view whether it is a Prodigy – it came from Prodigy or from PRASA as long as the content was acceptable.  In other words the terms and conditions were acceptable there is no issue with you because you say there were others which were signed like that or did I misunderstand?    Ja.   Yes but basically your answer to my question is yes.    Ja okay.  Mr Soni.   I think what you – what you – what you conceded or may have conceded is there may be some vagueness about whether…    Ja about the duration.    But I understood you also to say as far as you are concerned the deliverables are there.    There is a column that says deliverables.  There is a column that says responsible.    Person ja.  Okay  Mr Soni we…     Are we now moving away from that partnership/agreement?     [Indistinct]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Yes.  Then...  I heard Mr Montana saythat Mr Dingiswayo suggests, maybe by implication, I am not sure, that that training arrangement should have gone out to open tender.  Is that something that is an issue or not?     Oh, you will come to it?     Okay alright.     But your response to 14.2, is that you do not know whether he was asked by Mr Khuzwayo to do what he says he was asked to do but you noted?  Or you say you do know that he was asked?    Yes.     Ja ...[intervenes]      Okay alright.     Yes.     Yes, okay.     H’m.     H’m, yes.     H’m, h’m.    You say he was not the right person to say whether he should draft or not without raising his concerns up to the highest level if necessary?     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     H’m, h’m.     That is where it ends.     H’m?     Okay.     Okay. MR     Was that Mr Molefe?     Yes.     H’m?  And the Minister that time was...[intervenes]      H’m.     Who decided?     Mr Dingiswayo.     Okay.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, I wanted to say let us stop the detour now.       I know you wanted to give a certain...[intervenes]      Ja, okay alright.  Mr Soni.     And he does not attach the email, hey, Mr Soni?     Yes but you see ...[intervenes]      Part of the – I have noticed, maybe it is     He does not tell us he raised questions with whom.     And now in 14.4 he said Prodigy sent a further email but he does not say who it was addressed to.  He says it is set out, the thrust and purposes of the agreement but one would have thought that if he does not – one assumes that he has seen the email.    H’m.     Yes, well ...[intervenes]     At the time or ...[intervenes]      You mean when he gave evidence?  When he gave evidence in theCommission.     Yes, one would have liked that if he did not attach the email, at least he says who it was addressed to and what it said.      Ja, okay alright.       Ms Kondowe.     Yes.    Ja, he also does not say who put forward that view.       No, Mr Soni.  It is under control.      He is responding correctly.  It is under control.   ADV VAS SONI     And did that interest ...[intervenes]      Yes.  And that investigation you are talking about there, which one is that?     Oh.     Oh, okay.     Yes.    Ja, okay.  No, that is fine.  Continue, Mr Soni.     Maybe it would help that, as we proceed, we know who you identified as being behind this company you are talking about.  Maybe, as we proceed, that willhelp to know who you are talking about or who were the people that you say were behind the campaign.     H’m?    H’m?  Oh, okay, okay, Mr Montana, I understand.  I just want us to know the personalities that you regarded as behind the campaign.  So one, it was the Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes, those were the four people.     Okay.    You say you cannot remember his surname but his name was Allan.     Allan?     Oh, okay, he was responsible for training at PRASA and I think he used to sit on the board of theTransport Training Authority, TETA, on the side of PRASA, Chair.     But you say he was also part of the campaign?     Prodigy, ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Okay, alright.  Mr Soni?     Ja.  No, no, that is fine.  I just want to say, Mr Soni, that I would have expected Mr Dingiswayo to have given his reasons for the view that the contracts wereinvalid or the Prodigy contract was invalid before getting to the point where we are.     But maybe he does that later.     Because, you see, there may be something to be said for what Mr Montana says in relation to paragraph 14.6 namely that he says here was the general view that everybody had mainly they accepted thatthese contracts were invalid.  Here was an exception, Mr Montana, but one would have expected him to motivate to say it was invalid because of a, b, c, d so that when we come – so that we can then weigh Mr Montana’s different view against the reasons given.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes, yes.     Okay.     Ja.     I am sorry, I have not heard thequestion.     And the answer is no.     Ja.     No, but Mr Soni, I think he makes an example that appears to me to support the point he makes on the face of it.  He is saying there are certain circumstances where you do not go out on tender and he says – one such example, I do not – it may well be that on the merits of FIFA you might not be so – you might not be correct, Mr Montana, because prior to FIFA awarding the 10 World Cup to South Africa a lot of countries were competing to be awarded this, so maybe that might not besuch a good example but I think the point you are making is there are certain circumstances when PRASA or any government entity would not be required to go out on tender.     And rightly or wrong you believe that this one was one such a case.     As I say, you made the example about FIFA, might not back up that point, but ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, okay.       Yes. Yes.     Well, maybe – well, let me ask this question.  You have a recollection whether the legal department at PRASA had an input before the contract wassigned with Prodigy had an input because then that would have been the opportunity for them to raise issues if they thought there was something that was not right.     Yes.  So the legal department gotinvolved at the stage of putting together the agreement.     The partnership agreement.     Structure.     Process.     Yes.     Yes, yes, yes.     Yes, ja.     Yes, yes.  No, that is fine, I just want – I am just – I might not have seen this before, I might nothave picked it up, I am just saying that to the extent that Mr Dingiswayo may - in his affidavit may be criticising that the PRASA Prodigy agreement was invalid and should not have been entered into, he should not just make a statement it was invalid, he must tell us why was it invalid and if, in his affidavit, he does not actually do that, that is a defect in what he is telling us.     And – ja because, as I say, there may be merit in what Mr Montana was saying about paragraph 14.6that the picture given is everybody accepts this is invalid, this is just a one out, is an exception.  He sees it differently.  But then you – if you do not tell us why is it invalid, number one, who was saying it was invalid because he just says there was a view that was put forward.  No,no, he says there was a general acceptance that the contracts were invalid and then he says there was a view that Prodigy was innocent and so on.  So it may well be that Mr Dingiswayo needs to be asked to say why is he saying that but I think we can – oh, we are at one already.     H’m.     Okay.  No, that is alright.  Okay, let us take the lunch adjournment, it is about three minutes, fourminutes to one, we will resume at five minutes past two.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS    Okay, let us continue.     Okay, I think let us put it this way.  Here he suggests that you made, you sighted as an example thathe had told PRASA employees to cancel some tender.  Would that sentence be correct if we change tender to tenders?    Contracts, ja.     Yes, yes.  If he said contracts there would that sentence be correct then?    Because he says you said as an example that he had told PRASA employees to cancel some tender.  You are saying one, you did not talk about a tender.  You talked about not one contract but a number of contracts.    Existing contracts and your version is that you raised the issue that in respect of a number of existing contracts, he had said they should be cancelled.  Is that your version?  What you have said to him on that occasion?    Yes.    Yes.  General acceptance.  MR    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    Ja.     Comes complete.    So would it be correct to say you did accuse him on that occasion of telling PRASA employees to cancel certain existing contracts?    Yes.     In the finance department.     Ja, okay.  Alright.  I hope that helps MrSoni to clarify.    Yes.     About the campaign.    Ja, okay.    Okay.  Mr Soni?    Oh, there was one called Mashonisa?    Okay.    Okay.  Alright.     So just to make clear what your concern was with regard to what you say Mr Dingiswayo was doing, what he and others were doing.  with regard to Mr Dingiswayo your objection was that on your understanding, he was making decisions that he had no authority to make in the company in terms of instructing people to cancelcontracts, or is the position that on your understanding, he was giving advice as opposed to giving instruction to certain people in the company to cancel contracts in circumstances where that advice should go through certain channels and it was not going through certain channels.  I just want you to identify what it is that you found unacceptable in terms of what he was doing?    Let me try and summarise what you are saying, as I understand it for you to say if that is a fair summary or not.  You are saying prior to this meeting that you had with Mr Dingiswayo, you had come to the view that there was a campaign that was being waged by certain people against you, and you have named them. I think they were five when you added, and MrDingiswayo was one of them.     And when you called him to this meeting this particular evening, you had a discussion with him and you decided to fire him and you told him so.     The reason why you fired him, is that you had concluded that he was working against the interest of PRASA.     And you say that was evidenced by his participation in this campaign.    And you say that he was in this campaign was also the conclusion that he was part of this campaignwas also shown by the fact that he or they were selective in terms of the contracts which they said should be cancelled or should be investigated. There were other contracts which may have had similar problems which they were not investigating.  That is why you dismissed him.    Ja.     Yes.     Ja, that email.    Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Mr Soni?    Well, you said something about, you said the normal process would be a disciplinary inquiry.    And you said to him but for people like you, as I recall your evidence, in effect it is not evennecessary to go that route.  You are fired.  Is my understanding correct?    Ja.    Ja.  MR    Ja.     Ja.     Mr Soni?    Your thinking at the time.     Yes, ja.     Yes.    Ja.     Well, let me ask you the question.  Did the disciplinary procedures of PRASA allow you to make that kind of decision before there could be a disciplinary hearing and the affected employee could be heard?    Labour Relations Act, ja.     Okay.  Mr Soni?    Ja, and I wanted to say of course we accept that we are not CCMA.  We are not the Labour Court.  We are not here to assess the fairness or otherwise of the dismissal.    But I just wanted to get that information.    Just one second Mr Soni.     Okay, thank you.  You may proceed.      I guess if he says he got it the following day you would not take one take issue with that.      But you say it was prepared by the legal department would ...[intervenes]       Okay, well, I am ...[intervenes]     No, no, I accept that.  I am wondering whether seeing that you were dismissing him and him being in the legal department. And you intended as I understandit, Ms Magoyi as well was the head of that department. I am wondering whether you would have asked the same department to prepare his letter.     The HR.     Okay.     Ja.     Okay.     Well as I understand the position Mr Soni I think at the time that he wrote that email, he had made up his mind.      These were the people who were on thiscampaign. And he would get rid of those in regard to whom he had the power to get rid of them, and the rest that was happening load from there and I assume that your question may therefore be making the request or giving an instruction to the legal department or HR to prepare the letter, whether it would have been ahead of meeting Mr Dingiswayo that evening and telling him or after.     After your meeting.    Yes.    Ja.     But I am sorry Mr Soni, something – I have just remembered something.  You said you were looking for Mr Dingiswayo and you were told that he had left, and then you said he must call you. That raises the question. Why couldn't you wait until the followingmorning? Is this something that had happened that was quite urgent for you to call him all the way back?     That was the line ...[intervenes]     Okay.     Okay, alright.  Mr Soni?     General acceptance?     That was in relation to the Prodigy matter?     Okay.     Sorry, the most?    H’m.     Did you say 138?     Well, let me say this, Mr Montana, wehave as a Commission, we must keep an open mind. We must keep within our terms of reference.  We must not try and manipulate any evidence to put certain people in a bad light, or to create a foundation for certain findings to be made against people, and we mustn't close our eyes if the investigation suggests that we should pursue certain people – and I am saying pursue certain people but investigates allegations against them. We mustn't do that.You know in 2018, I think it was during the second half of the of the year, we started hearing of oral evidencein August 2018. There is a note or memo that I sent to the head of the legal team, Mr Pretorius and the head of the investigation team, Mr Nomgani, where I dealt with a number of things, but one of the things that I said in that letter was, it is very important for investigators of theCommission and the members of the legal team that when they investigate, they investigate whoever, irrespective of what their position may be at the moment, irrespective of what their position may have been in the past, and irrespective of what the position is likely to be in the future. That is in black and white, which I said to them.  That is what I always expected the investigation team and the legal team to do, it is in black and white.  Now, of course as the - as the - as we investigate, sometimes people will accuse the Commission of certainthings, even when they know that they cannot put any evidence before anybody if they are asked to put the evidence that sometimes there is no why they do that, like something like, you know, they commission inspection, it's assuming certain people and not other people. It's true. It's in the hope that the Commission will start not to do its job properly when it comes to certain people, because it is scared that people will say you see, we told you, they are scared now.   Now, my approach is that we must do what we arerequired to do. In doing so we must be fair but that doesn't mean we must agree to everything, but we must be fair you know.  I told you last week that I am happy that you came, and you are putting your side of the story. I don't know what you think, but I think in all probability, you do feelthat you are being heard. You are being heard.  We don't say we don't make mistakes along the way, we may make mistakes, but it doesn't necessarily mean that we have certain agendas. And I am hoping that I wish you had come much earlier because maybe other people might have seen that. Well, if you go there, you're allowed to put your side of things, and you will be heard you know, whatever happens about what findings will be made, but the process you will have been heard and that has got its own important basis.  So ja.   Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  Mr Soni.    If you want to look at it a copy can be provided.    Just in case.    J.    Ja.  Ja.   But let us – let us be more specificbecause you will recall that I was saying Mr Dingiswayo should have said why these contracts he was saying these contracts were invalid or certain people were saying these contracts were invalid letting close the Prodigy contracts.You said earlier on the tender process was not applicable because this was a partnership.  Now in effect is that the ground on which you say 217 did not apply?  Is that correct?    Yes, yes.    Oh okay, okay.    In a different context.   Yes.    Ja okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, ja.    Ja, no, no that is fine.    Yes. But – but that – I take it that that because you say this offer was an offer of a partnership let us partner together with this.  I take it that that is what you mean and you – you are meaning for part – offers of partnerships you do not have to go out on open tender.   Ja.    Yes.   Ja.    Yes, yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    I think Mr Soni because I kind of read where you were going with the question – 217 question I think you need to just …    Put it on the table so that it can be dealt with properly Ja.   Ja maybe let us do it this way.  Well Section 217 talks about whenever you are going to procuregoods or services what Prodigy was going to do was provide services or you say no?  They were going to train your employees.    No, no I accept that but I just want us to see – to go step by step.  Do you accept that Prodigy was going to provide services to PRASA by way of providing training or you say no, no, no.    That is not services.    Ja.    Ja exceptions.    Ja.    Yes.    No, no I understand what you are saying.  You see as I understand this procurement laws and regulations you have a general rule and that general rule is you are an organ of state and it seeks to procure goods or services you must go through a fair, cost effective, competitive process okay.   Now then you have the regulations or policies or Treasury instructions which say there are circumstances where you can – where you are entitled not to follow the general rule.  So the exception is to the general rule.   One of those is if you are faced with an emergency – no I do not know if they use that term but if you are faced with an emergency there is no time to invite tenders or bids so you can go to once service provider and say hey therewas a storm here this is what has happened and they  - that is accepted – it is permitted let me put it that way.And then there is a situation where they say if a sole I think they call it a sole source situation where that provider of a product or service is the only one that provides those –that kind of – type of product or service to say in other words it will not – it will not serve any purpose to invite bids because this is the only one.  Okay.  And there – there may be other exceptions okay.  So – so – but those exceptions kick in because you are trying to procure goods or services.  If you are not trying to procure goods or services then they would not kick in and you would not even use the general rule you know because it    Ja okay, alright.    You agree okay.    Yes, yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    So maybe before you proceed therefore what I am looking for and I suspect what Mr Soni    May be looking for too is which one of the exceptions that are known to the general rule you may be relying on or whether the position is that we do not even get to the exceptions because I say this is not goods or services.  That is – that is what we are trying to do.    Of course yes.   Of course.    I know I have heard quite some evidence.    Ja.    So – I just want to summarise what I think you are saying and then you can say whether my summary is – is a fair summary or not.You are saying at the time you took the view that this was a partnership and that where an organ of state is gettinginvolved into a partnership for something to be done there was no obligation to go into a tender process.  Is that correct?    Oh okay maybe – now I remembersomething that you said.    Earlier on.  Okay.  You – at the time you took the view that this project – this project that you – that Prodigy wanted to get involved in with PRASA was going to be a partnership.    Is that right?    That is point 1.  Point 2 you took the viewthat this particular one did not require PRASA to go into a tender process.   So I must just clarify here whether your position was that all partnerships as long as it is a partnership you do not need to use an open tender or whether you are saying this – but it is some partnerships and this was one of them you do not have to go through a process of a tender process.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    To the 3000.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     [Indistinct]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, no I understand your explanation completely.  So the deciding factor seems to me from what you have said in relation to the first 300 ...[intervenes]     ...was that Prodigy had been appointed or awarded, I am not sure what the correct term is ...[intervenes]      ...by the Seta, had been awarded a certain amount of money ...[intervenes]      ...that had been put aside and had been, in effect, authorised to go and to training.    Anything else, really, did not make any difference.  That is what made it a difference to you.  Is that right?     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Whether ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes. MR     Yes.     Ja.     The question.     Ja.    Yes.     Ja.     Ja, okay alright.  So you used the word partnership to say going out on tender does not apply because this is a partnership but in the end you say, you know, the fact that Seta had given them Prodigy orawarded or appointed, that is what made the difference in my own mind as to whether we should go out on tender or not.     Ja.     Ja, ja.     Ja.     Ja, ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.  and then just to complete because you have touched on the 3000.  you already said that you didn't think about in that way at the time ...[intervenes]      ...but when it comes to - when it came to PRASA expanding this scope of the arrangement withProdigy to include the 3 000, maybe that is where PRASA ...[intervenes]      ...should not have gone out on tender.  and you say it at that time you did not think of it that waybut now you think maybe that is what should have happened.     Ja.      Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Process.     Yes.     Ja.      H’m, ja, ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.    Yes.     Ja, okay alright.  Mr Soni.    I am hoping there is clarity that has emerged.     Ja.     Ja.  No, no, no.     I think you mean every.     I think you ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes.     Ja.     Ja.    Ja.     Ja.    SCM.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  I think what we should do - what should be done Mr Soni is this.  I understand Mr Soni to be saying, at that time I didn't think there was an obligation on PRASA to go out on tender in regard to the first 300.  As I sit here I still have the same view but because of the discussion I think it may be that we should have but we did not think so.  I think in that - in the light of what should be done, we should just get all the facts thatwe can get.  So the suggestion is that, let us establish how – from the Seta, how this so called bursaries ...[intervenes]      ...because they - and how they are awarded and the contracts because I see in this later Prodigy said they were attaching the copy of the bursary contract or they say a copy of the bursary contract.  Ja.  but it is not attached yet      So.  Because the terms of that contractwhich must be, I guess in the Seta and Prodigy, might affect these issues that we are looking at, you know.  And you remember earlier on I was asking Mr Montana asked you the prices of payment because I was trying to see who is obliged to make the payments because on the one handMr Montana was saying this meant that the Seta add set aside money for training but it had not given Prodigy the cash.  But at the same time I was hearing that PRASA would be paying and training back and so on.  So It is important to just get the actual fact.  How does it work and so on and so on.  And then once we have got all of that as well as including what actually happened in this particular case when the Seta awarded Prodigy this so called bursaries, the bursary funding.  And then once we have got all of those facts then we can - I think we can deal with the issue properly.  And it would be important that at that stage we hear your comments Mr Montana because then you would also be having those facts.  But I think in regard to the 3000, you are much closer to making a concession then you are with the 300.  I think you are closer to making the concession there.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, ja.       Yes, ja, ja.     Yes, yes, yes.     That would then ...[intervenes]      Ja, yes.     But basically, you are dealing with this two separate because the training might be the same, different categories of people being trained but the process is not exactly the same.  So you are saying that it lookslike – well, you are saying, I think, you are not sure whether in regard to the 3 000 the process that you followed included taking this matter to the Adjudication Committee of PRASA.     And you are saying that if you did and that committee aid go ahead or something like that, you would say it was lawful.       But you are saying if that did not even happen then you would concede that then you did not follow ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay.     Ja.     Yes, and still ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes.     Ja, ja.    Ja, ja.     No, no ...[intervenes]     Ja, ja.     No, no ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Ja.     No, I think the point you raise when you say what is the effect of the fact that the Seta awarded Prodigy these bursaries, this bursary funding, it is a legitimate point to look at.  That is why it becomes important also to say if there were terms and conditions to which governed this award to Prodigy by the Seta, we ought to know.I mean, I – if for example the Seta said to    So now I do not know because I do not know this contract between Prodigy and the Seta.  I do not know whether that was the position or not.     You know.  I think it is a legitimate point you have raised.  Let us look at it.  Let us get all the facts and then we take it from there.       The second paragraph from the top.    H’m?    Ja, let us look into it.     Ja.    Ja.  Well, let me confirm this.  When one reads this letter of Prodigy, when I read it at least, I get the impression that PRASA wanted to pilot its Centre of Excellence Model.  That is what PRASA wanted to do.  It gives the impression that it so happened that Prodigy was looking for an entity whose employees it could train because it had been awarded this bursary funding.  I am saying that simply because of how the letter is worded.  “It is further to discussion held from March 2010 with respect to the Centre of Excellence Model, Prodigy hereby confirms that it is able to provide PRASA with 300 funded learnerships that will fast track thepiloting of the Centre of Excellence Model...”So it gives me the impression that [word cut] wanted to pilot to this model and they happened to want an entity whose employees they would train and then there was – then they made this proposal which is if you let us train your staff you will benefit because then your project – then you will be piloting your Centre of Excellence.  Is that what happened?  Is that a fair reading or not really?     Prior to the letter.     But I – I may have asked this question before because I was trying at that time to establish who actually ultimately and in effect paid Prodigy for thetraining services that it provided to PRASA employees?     It was PRASA?     Even in regard to the 300 because I am talking about the 300.     Yes.     Ja.     And the SETA that they are talking about here is which SETA?     The Services SETA, yes.     Yes, but I mean the SETA, the Services SETA put aside a certain amount of money.     For Prodigy to conduct training.  Prodigy ended up or rather conducted training in respect of initially 300 employees of PRASA.  Now I would expect that they were paid through the money that the SETA put aside.     But will it spend the exact amount ofmoney that the SETA has put aside or what?     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes, so what is the difference between a company such as Prodigy coming to PRASA without going to – without being awarded bursary funding by SETA andsaying we would like to train your staff, we think that you can benefit from the training that we can give your staff and for that service we are going to charge R100 million or whatever.  What is the difference between …[intervenes]     Because in the later case obviously they must look to you for payment.  Now if they have gone to the SETA and the SETA has put aside money for this training is it still PRASA that ultimately pays them?  So what is the need to go to the SETA?    The 300.     Ja.  Ja, I think we …[intervenes]    I think we need to find more information because for me if you say you are granting some student a bursary, that means you will pay for it, you pay for theirstudies.   So this says the SETA awarded Prodigy was refunding for training so I have difficulty understanding how it could come about that then PRASA must pay in full for the training.  I can understand if the arrangement is the SETA will pay a certain percentage and then PRASA must maybe cough up whatever but we need to establish that because also in terms of who is going to make the – who will pay, who has the obligation to pay, that might affect the question of whether we are dealing with a tender situationor not if, in effect, PRASA is not going to pay or is going to pay a very small amount.  So we will need to just get information on that.  I certainly do not know much about how SETAs operate and [indistinct – dropping voice].   Okay, alright.  We are at quarter past four.  I have in mind that we will go up to five because there is an evening session but I must say already tomorrow there is space.  Tomorrow there is space so to the extent that – because I think it is clear we are not going to finish with Mr Montana.  There is a witness that is scheduled for tomorrow but he willnot be long so we might have to decide whether he should come in the morning, finish with him and then Mr Montana continues, if available, or whether we ask him to come later in the day, we start with Mr Montana.  Are you available tomorrow, Mr Montana?You say you are under…[intervenes]     That we would finish today.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Ja, no, no, that is fine.  So, no, no, I think that is good because we would like to try and finalise and I am sure you would like to get to the end of the process as well.  So let us take a break now, ten minutes break, come back and continue until five and then we will adjourn until tomorrow and then hopefully we finish tomorrow.  But I think what is important is that issues are being dealt with, we are doing justice to the issues and that is important.  Okay, let us take an adjournment, it is about seventeen minutes past four, let usresume at half past four.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    You might too far from the mic, Mr Soni.     Is it possible to bring that mic of yours more to the centre because I think you do move away from it and it is right at the corner.     Ja, okay, okay.  If that will not interfere with your...     Okay, alright.    Did you say page 135? ADV VAS SONI     Ja.  Well I was looking, you commented in respect of paragraph 4.18 which you read out.  In regard to that paragraph you commented that what you are saying there was not even part of his conclusion but then I wentback to see what heading it falls under.  I see that it falls under findings.  So what he is saying there, is a finding.  I have not – I do not – I have not read this report recently so my memory is not fresh on it but from the markings that I have made on it, I think it would have been dealt with earlier but I see also that – I see it is a progress report but I see     Ja.    Ja.     Ja.       So with regard to Mr Dingiswayo have you exhausted…?  Okay, so tomorrow it would be …[intervenes]     Yes.  Okay, alright.  Okay, we are going to adjourn then this day session.  Let us continue tomorrow and let us start at half past nine tomorrow as well, if we can.  Is that fine, Mr Montana?  Half past nine?  Is fine?     Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Ja, maybe we should rather start with him.  Okay, I think we should start with him.  I think let us start – resume your evidence at half past ten.     If we are not done with him you might have to wait a bit but we should not take too long with him.  Ja, okay.  We are then adjourning the day session.  I willtake a ten minutes break and then we will start the evening session.  I have been very bad, the staff and technicians, they just hear me saying we have an evening session and then do not always get to know well in advance.  I am sorry about that.  But they have been very good, they have been very cooperative and given the Commission the time to do its work in the evening.  I will ask the secretary to be in touch with them so that where there may be some challenges we can see how we can sort those out.  I am hoping that this evening it would still be fine but if thereare challenges in terms of [word cut] and that without whom we cannot proceed, they must just let us know in due course, the – I will ask the Secretary of the Commission to be in touch with everybody but I will take – we will take a ten minute adjournment and then we will – I will come backand then we start with the evening session.   I have in mind that we would go at least up to eight but if there’s nobody who is complaining we might go to nine o’clock but I think that there are a lot of people here who are very committed to the work of the Commission.   I will take a ten minute adjournment.     Yes, you are excused.     Thank you. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Good afternoon Mr Pretorius, good afternoon everybody.     Yes, are you ready?     Well this application I was told about last night, I have not read it, why should I hear it now?     Ja, you might not be the right person to ask.     Ja, who is the right person?   I haven’t even authorised that he should be before me now.     Let’s leave that part.   Who is here?     Yes, who is here?    Yes?     Ja, well I haven’t read it in the firstplace, why should it be dealt with now before I hear Dr Dintwe’s evidence?     Ja.    Why must they be struck out?     Ja, but that is none of your business, that is the Commission’s business, if the Commission admits them as irrelevant it does not hurt you so why is that your business.   It would be different if they hurt you,they infringe your rights, your client’s rights, but that they are irrelevant this is not litigation where you are a party, this is an inquiry.     Yes.     No, no, if they don’t infringe your rights, your client’s rights, it is just that they are irrelevant I don’tsee why that should be your business, that is what I am saying.   It is different if you say they infringe your client’s rights.     Yes, when did you get the – Dr Dintwe’s affidavit?     Yes, but I am looking at the time, if you got it on the 29 t h of March that means today is what – thet h?     Then I see that it was signed on the 19 t h of April the Notice of Motion so where were you for three weeks?     Ja.    He was away on?     So he went on leave instead of preparing his application?    But in the end apart from saying that certain allegations are  irrelevant what else is your – whatother complaints do you have about the allegations to which you are objecting?     Okay, no, no that is fine.  I don’t think that that should be something that should hold up me hearing the evidence, you will be able to deal with the allegations in terms of whether they are true or not, I think that is the important thing.   As Dr Dintwe gives evidence if there is something that I consider irrelevant I will deal with it as we go along and Mr Pretorius will also be aware of that, and – but that is not something that should hold up the hearing of his evidence.    That is what I am inclined to do, based on what you have said so far, that is what I would like to do, is there any reason why you think I should not do that.     Yes, yes.   You have done it in the sameapplication?     No, no that would be different, applying for leave to adduce evidence or applying for leave for cross-examine that would not be different, but that can be dealt with after.     Yes well in fact even on the question of relevance if you -  I mean from what you are saying you really were mentioning the issue of relevance but you apply for leave to adduce evidence?     Yes, and you also apply for leave to cross-examine or not?     Okay.     Yes, what I will say is I do not thinkthere is a warrant to deal with it now, okay.   If you later on after today wish to indicate what you insist you want a decision on other than your application for leave to adduce evidence you must write to the Secretary and indicate and then – because obviously that can be dealt with but it does not have to be dealt with now.     No, no I am saying I am not going toneed to deal with it now, okay, the application for leave to adduce evidence I can deal with that later, we don’t have to deal with that now, if there is any other thing that you want a decision on in regard to this application other than the application for leave to adduce evidence you must let me know in due course through the Secretary, but there is no need to deal with it now.     Okay, thank you.  Yes Mr Pretorius? Please administer the oath or affirmation.     If you are going to take off your mask when you give evidence you may as well take it off now.     I am sorry you just have to speak up so your answers can be recorded.    Registrar you are whispering to me.        Well you don’t have to start from the beginning if his earlier answers were audible but if you are not sure then start from the beginning, if you are not sure, if you are sure that they were audible it is fine.     Thank you, you may be seated Dr Dintwe.  Thank you very much Dr Dintwe for availing yourself to assist the Commission, we appreciate that very much.Yes Mr Pretorius?     Yes.     Yes.       I am sorry Mr Pretorius, I just picked up something here and maybe you are aware of it, the – Dr Dintwe’s affidavit in this file appears at the end, and I see that I cannot see any annexures to it, and yet I understand that his affidavit has got annexures.     Okay.     Okay.     Hang on Mr Pretorius.   You request meto admit his affidavit?     As an exhibit?  It would be Exhibit?  YY15.And the affidavit of Dr Setlhomamaru Isaac Dintwe starting at page 75 is admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit YY15.     One second.   Yes Mr Pretorius you may proceed.     What is the – if you could clarify this for me, what is the source of the power to make that document called MISS?  What is the – is there a provision in somelaw that says so and so may make this document?     Sorry?    Yes, but what I want to find out is what makes it binding and is it binding only internally within the Security bodies or is it something that has – does it have legal force, is it a regulation, supporting legislation, is it just a document that reflects cabinet’s decision or that reflects the President’s decision or that reflects a certain Minister ’s decision or a certain group of – a decision of a certain group of Ministers because there has been a lot of reference to it in the past as well but I have never heardexactly whether it is a regulation that is made under the Oversight Act that you referred to, or where the power comes from to make that document?     Well unless the Constitutional Court – unless the Constitutional Court in its decision said that this document is binding and then I assume indicated on whom it is binding, I am not sure that you are right because if it just assumed that it has legal force because it wasn’t necessary for it to decide in that particular case whether the document had a legal force that might be a different thing, but I assume from what you are saying that you aresaying to me you do not know whether it has any legal force or not but up to now everybody treats it as if it has legal force and when I say legal force I am thinking about if it is not part of legislation then it must be regulations or if somewhere there is provision to say such a document may be made, and it says who makes that document and under – for what purpose you know then one would trace the origin of the ultimate power or the source of the power for it, but if it was – it is simply somebody’s decision no matter who that person is who just decided it would begood that we should have a document that sets out A, B, C, D and that document was prepared and it may be it does have a good purpose because there needs to be guideline but sometimes you need to know does this document, is it just a document of convenience that does not have legalforce or is it a document that has legal force, so that is why I was asking, but I think you are saying, one, it started as you understand as a document that reflected cabinet decision and then there was the case that went to the Control Court and you say arising subsequent to that you understand it to be taken to the finding and that’s all you are able to say.     Oh there is such a debate?    Yes.     Yes.     Yes, no, no that is fine, I was asking because in the context of the evidence relating to IPID there was a lot of reference to it when there was the issue of IPID witnesses were saying the police were refusing to declassify documents that IPID needed for theirinvestigations and in your affidavit I know that you referred to that as well and they were – there was this reference to this document and it seemed to be difficult to get also so – okay, alright.    Yes.     Okay, alright.     Well, you mentioned ... I thought you said there were three complaints or something like that.     Or is it, was it a complaint about the same conduct on your part, but coming from three ministers.  Were they complaining about the same thing?    Ja, yes okay.    Was the same?   Okay, okay alright.     It was the one that you mentioned?  Yes.    I am sorry.    He nodded but that will not be recorded.  The allegation that was being made in the three documents, was the allegation that you have told meabout, namely that you disclosed certain information to the commission before the consultation process.     Oh.    Oh.    Ja, okay.  Okay.    Ja.     Well, if they are not important or relevant, that is fine.     Okay, alright.    Any other information, yes.     Well, hang on Dr Dintwe.  I do remember that I have previously seen a file that has got the legislation and I think regulations and whatever, but I cannot remember the background.  I would have assumed that I got it just from the legal team, but as you speak I now think that there was a file that would have seem to come direct from outside the commission that had just that, but I have no recollection of whether it had a covering letter, and if it had a covering letter what the covering letter was saying. Are you saying that whatever was sent, you did see?      You can refresh my memory.    Yes.     It was coming from which minister?    Yes, okay.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes.  ADV PRETORIUS    Yes, yes.    I would like to see it, now knowing this context which I did not know before.     Okay, alright.  So but is the position that as far as you understand, what prompted the sending of that file  by Minister Dlodlo was that you seemed to be, you seemed not to be keen to send just that.  you wanted to give the commission more or you thought you seem toindicate to them that it was impossible to just give them the commission [indistinct].It is just that it is interesting.     Okay, alright.     They perform the same function as a portfolio committee, but it under it various departments?    You know, for ja.     Alright.     Well you need to make use of the white paper where as you put it its contents of principles arealready mirrored in the constitution or legislation because I would have thought that once that has been done you must just comply with the constitution and the legislation.    Yes okay.  Alright.     Well – well…    I am sorry – I am sorry.  What you did not tell me about maybe it was not important but now that you tell me about legal advice is your own background a legal background or not? DR    Oh okay alright.  So you have to depend on legal advisors?    Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.   Sorry.    Sorry Mr Pretorius.  The document you are talking about is the document that is called certificate?    Okay so – so when you talk about acertificate in your affidavit I must not have in mind a one page document it is like a certificate it is a lengthy document.  It is then in effect as you say an annual report is then in effect as you say an annual report.    Yes.    Ja.   Oh.    Ja, yes.    Okay.  Okay.    Okay.    Okay alright.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Well – well I must say that I was already asking those questions when I was hearing a lot of SASSA evidence or not SASSA – SSA evidence so where was the Inspector General?  But you are here now to tell me where you were.    Okay alright.    Okay.   We will get there ja.    I like the way you put it Mr Pretorius.  Legitimate suspicion – reasonable suspicion.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Okay no that is fine.     Okay, okay.     H’m.    [No audible reply]      [laughs]    There is the issue of capacity.DR     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.  There are vacancies which are not filled?     Yes.     Yes.     But has there been an exercise done which seeks to answer the question how many staff should it have, should this office have if it is to realistically and effectively do its job?  Has there been that kind of exercise? And is there a report that has been furnished to those who control the purse and those who can do     Ja.     H’m.     Yes, but of course, that has to be wrong because if legislation says there must be the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence or there must be the Inspector General of Intelligence to perform the following functions.If those functions cannot effectively be performed by the Inspector General of Intelligence withoutother people or professionals, then you are making – rendering the office ineffective if you know that there are vacancies and nothing is done to fill those vacancies and if you have...I guess it would be difficult to say appointments are not made because we have no money, you know.  Because how then do you expect the office to perform if already there has been a determination that at least there should be – there is justification for there to be 34-posts.  It is different if you have not elected and it has not beenmade.       Yes.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.  Okay.       Ja, probably maybe that is the issue because otherwise everyone who has to ask somebody, the government for money will tell you they never get given what they want, you know, [laughs] where even withgovernment departments, ministers will always complain, you know, that the Minister of Finance will not give you what you want.  Now you come and you say this is what I want and you think you have motivated sufficiently but they always or very often you will get a little bit less.  But it is important that whoever makes that decision must be somebody who can be taken to – take into account on legitimate factors in deciding.  But your point might be that what you would prefer is that the money that should be used by IGI should be ring fenced by Parliament even if itis under SSA or whoever but you should not be talking to somebody about how much it should be.  Parliament should ring fence it and say this is for IGI and then you should be able to use it for the operations of your office.  And if somebody has to account for it other than yourself, then it must at least be furnishing whatever needs to be furnished but Parliament should be the ones who say – Parliament should be able to say out of this budget for SSA, it is SSA, so much is for IGI and cannot be touched by somebody else.  Is that what you are talking about or not really?    Yes.     Yes.    Yes, yes.     So your complaint is that there is a certain baseline that was determined at a certain stage there may have been a valid reason to go below that at a certain stage when there was no IGI but once there was – once you had been appointed should have gone back to the baseline.     Ja.  You are not complaining aboutwanting it to be ring fenced or anything?  That is not your...?     Oh.     Oh, that is achieved?     It has been achieved?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.    Ja.     So that has not been done in regard to IPI?     The ring fencing happens after the Parliament has appropriated?     So the ring fencing gets done by SSA?    And your point is, it should be done by Parliament just as it is done in regard to the Public Protector and other institutions?     Okay.      Okay alright.  Let us take a ten minutes adjournment.  Or do you want to ask one more question?     Ja, okay.    [No audible reply]      So if you receive a complaint from a member of the public about SSA or members of SSA, onceit is in your own system they can access it?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, ja.     Yes.    Okay let us take a ten minutes adjournment and then we will continue.  I think we will come back at quarter past or so.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     So just, Mr Pretorius, just to go back whether that first sentence is correct of not.  You are saying insofar as it says the Director General of SSA has control over the filling of the position, you say that is fine and that is correct because you are not saying he has the power to fill the position.  The power to fill the position vests in the Minister but the Minister in order to fill the position must know that there will be money to pay thosepeople who will be appointed and the Director General, as the accounting officer, is the one who has got to say something about this.  So if he is not in support you will end up not having appointment.     Okay. ADV PRETORIUS     Just one second?  I may have missed this earlier.  The IGI position, at what level in terms of public service is it ranked, if it is ranked at all?     Okay, okay.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Okay.  No, that is fine.     What does that have to do with you?     Yes.  Yes, you know the operational requirements of the office.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Registrar please…     Ja.     Now obviously what you are, what you have just said definitely relates to the period that you have been there, so I want to ask the question whether because you have – you may have access to previous annual reports or certificates that were given or issued by your predecessors and those before them, whether you know that those reports were given in the same way as you have been doing them, namely every year if that is the positionand they are given to the same people and bodies.     Ja.     Well it’s the fact that you say you have given reports, reports have been given even before your time, you know annually pointing out abuses and problemsthat should have been fixed, but it seems nothing was fixed in terms of what was pointed out or maybe very little was fixed is concerning because the evidence I have heard seems to suggest also that talking about Parliament it would have been given, the Auditor General’s reports about various government departments and SOE’s and yet in terms of how it used those reports in respect of the SOE’s about which I have had a lot of evidence of corruption, you are not sure what happens, but apart from that Boards of SOE’s as well as cabinet, Ministers responsible for certainSOE’s, about whom I have had a lot of corruption going you know spreading over a number of years one thinks that they would have been given reports every year of the state of affairs in those SOE’s, but when I hear the evidence that I have been hearing in terms of what happened over a number of years it is like nobody bothers to read those reports, and the problems continue.I mean I was hearing evidence from the former Group CEO of PRASA today with regard to PRASA, I have heard evidence where the late Auditor General pointed outhow irregular expenditure was going up astronomically every year and it looked like nobody was doing anything about this, so maybe there is a problem in South Africa that people don’t read reports and act on them, because the kinds of abuses that I have heard about in regard toSSA don’t suggest that anybody was aware of the problems because anybody who was aware of those problems and didn’t do anything really needs to relook at themselves.      Yes, yes.     So when you say you went to the previous President, Mr Jacob Zuma, and you have been to the current President to tell them about these problems, one, are you talking about the problems which are highlighted in your annual reports?     And maybe more, but certainly those?     Yes, and when you do that would you bring the reports with you or not really?     You would make a presentation.     Which is based on your annual reports?     And you do that yearly going to the President or it is an ad hoc arrangement?     Yes.    Yes, yes.   Okay, but the Joint Committee on Intelligence in Parliament do you know what it does with these reports that you give them annually?DR     ...whether it takes any action, I know that some of the things, or maybe everything that it deliberates on is not something one can talk about, but to your knowledge does it take any action to deal with the problems?     Okay, alright.  Well I see we are at quarter past eight, we were supposed to talk at eight o’clock about whether we go further or not.  From your side Mr Pretorius will you still be fine to go up to nine, or ...     You are obliged to be honest.     So you would like to stop now or at a different stage?     Okay, alright.   I was going to be very much guided by how the staff and the technicians feel but Ithink because you are the only one standing in the room when you indicate as you do I should allow that we – but maybe if we – so maybe if you do what you think you ...[intervenes]      Okay, alright, well I told them, you must have heard me earlier on say ...[intervenes]      ...but maybe the staff said hey he is abusing us.  Okay, alright, but they are very committed.   Okay I think let’s round off.   My concern was simply that I was hoping that we would do enough to giveus the comfort that tomorrow we should be able to finish with his evidence, but the other considerations are important so let us wrap up and then we see tomorrow.     Just remember to articulate your answer because when you nod that is not recorded.    I am sorry, before you go over the page.  Mr Dintwe, do you know which Minister of State Security they are referring to?    Okay.      Yes.  Yes, no that is fine, and then the ... then the MIST itself, if one could get, I do not knowwhether there are different MIST’s or there is this document based on what Mr Pretorius has just read there.  It looks like different ministers can produce different documents of this nature under their department.     Yes, yes.      Which applies to ...[intervenes]  MR    Oh, okay yes.     How thick is that document?     Yes.      Yes.      Okay, alright.  Okay.  Was that your last ...[intervenes]    Okay.  Thank you very much.  We are going to end here for the day.  The arrangement of course as I understand it is that you will come back tomorrow evening Dr Dintwe.      And to be here at four o’clock, but accepting that we might only be able to start at five, but if we are able to start at four, then that would be ...[intervenes]    Oh, okay.  Okay, thank you.  Okay, we are going to then adjourn.  Thank you to everybody, thankyou to the staff and the technicians and everybody.  Thank you to you Dr Dintwe.  Thank you Mr Pretorius and your team and the investigators for making it possible for the commission to sit until this time. Mr Pretorius, if I could see you in chambers briefly after we adjourn?    We adjourn.
ADV SONI SC:  Good morning Chairperson.    As you please Chairperson.  Chairperson I am obliged to place on record that we have received a letter from Mr Tiro Holele about certain allegations MrMontana made about him.  He wants to file an affidavit.  I am just bringing that to your attention.  He complains that he was not given notice that those allegations were going to be made .    But obviously tell him to file his affidavit.    As soon as possible.    Yes.    Mr Montana can I just indicate to you the road map for today and you might remember on Friday I indicated to you that there were four sets of affidavits that you would need to respond to.  We finished with Mr Molefe’s – well for most of that – today I want to start with the affidavit of Mr Dingiwayo then I will go to the affidavit of Ms Ngoye and then deal with the report of Mr Ormon [?].Now the affidavit of Mr Dingiswayo is in Bundle Fand it is Exhibit SS8 and it is F and starts at page 96.  Have you got that in front of you Mr Montana?    As previously I do not go over all the allegations it is just the allegations that concern you andyou know the process I follow which is asking you what you had admit you deny and what the basis of the denial is.Can I ask you to turn to page 97 paragraph 4.  I think it is the next page.  It is the black 97 number Mr Montana.  You will see on the left hand side page numbers.    No, no, no.  It starts with affidavit Mr Dingiswayo.      You can turn to page 97 he says at    Yes.  Then he carries on in the next sentence. “It is equally well-known that if you cross Mr Montana’s path or attempted to ensure that things were done lawfully and properly insofar as these entities and individuals are concerned he ruthlessly abused his powers and even arrogated to himself powers that he did not deserve.”Your reaction is the same?    Then in paragraph 9 he says   Yes I – I think you are quite right let us deal with the facts as he presents them and then after that as you present them.  Can I ask you then to look at paragraph 11.3 on page 99.  He says in paragraph 11.3. “Prodigy is a Johannesburg basedregistered private company.”    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh I am sorry I did mention it.    Yes, no that …    This is the entity yes.    And he says   Alright then he says it entered into a number of contracts with PRASA to provide training and other related services.Is that correct? MR    Yes.  Alright and then he – he notes that the validity of these contracts is now in dispute.    Now 11.4 he says   2011.    And you will find that Mr Montana at MMD1 page 123.  You do not need to look at it – it is just – I am just confirming that there.    Alright what we – what we can accept nowand I take the point you make is that Mr…    No that Prodigy when it first entered into the contract with PRASA did not have Mr Moodley as a director Mr Moodley became a director in 2011 andresigned as a director in 2012.  Are those the facts that    We can accept what the document says.    Yes okay.  Then at paragraph 11.6 on page    And then in paragraph 11.7 we have – we know that there is now a dispute that has been taken to court and PRASA is challenging the validity of the contract. I understand you say that you cannot be held responsible other made that.    Anyway we – we know what courts are.  Courts make their own decisions based on the informationfor them.  We leave that – we – that is the matter that has not yet been determined.   Now he also makes the point at paragraph 13 that there was an investigation conducted by Mr Majola and he annexures the outcome of that investigation isMMD2.  Can I just leave that out for a moment I want to come back to it in a little while.  I want to go…    Yes.  Then he says   I want to…    Yes.    Yes.    I – I agree entirely.    Really the only question will be because whether one should do that in relation to – we – what wedo not want and I understand fully why Chairperson is bits and pieces about the same thing in different parts of the transcript.    Now we – we either say that Mr Montana can deal with it now and then when his affidavit comes it will be then simply part of the record he will not have to deal with it again or we say Mr Montana we reserve this issue and deal with it collectively at the time that Mr Montana submits his affidavit.  I am just trying to find the   Yes.    Yes.    Absolutely.   As you please Chair.  Mr Montana I just want to finalise my concerns about the pro – the contract and I want to go back to page 174.  You will see there it is a R72million contract right.  You agree?  Page 174.    Yes on the left hand side you will see.    Yes.  Now that is not a small sum of money whatever goods or services one is procuring you agree?    Now I have looked at the terms of the contract because I accepted what Mr Dingiswayo had saidthat it supplied their program.  Now this is the difficulty I have.    Yes, no, no I understand.  This is the difficulty I have I have looked at the – the agreement it doesnot seem to reflect what Prodigy’s obligations are in regard to the training that they would provide.  Would the training be five days, would it be ten days, would it be twenty days?  I am talking about the agreement itself.  Would you agree with me?    Yes.  Mr Montana I am asking an entirely different question and I understand that you are pleased with the program and I am not saying you are not entirely    Mr Montana I have got no difficulty.  This is – this is my difficulty.  R72 million of tax-payers money nowwe say that Prodigy is responsible.  PRASA says somebody in PRASA you or whoever you not delivering.  How does one determine what in terms of the contract because this is not a – a – this is a contract that requires the production of certain things for payment of R72 million.  Do you agree that it is not in the – in the agreement what Prodigy should do?  I know it is responsible but if there is a dispute.    I say Chairperson that the – we know that Prodigy is to provide training.  That is the deliverable as they call it in the business world.  Now if there is a disputeabout whether it has delivered or not they – Mr Montana understood that they will have training for each person over twenty days in the six month period.  But Prodigy provides training for twelve days and there is a dispute about it.  One cannot turn to the – to the contract to say no but you are supposed to provide twenty.    Yes.    Well the question is it says – it starts off by saying the theoretical session is five days.    The – the sentence before that.    Says the theoretical session is five days.    Then it says this will be a ten day program.    Conducted over a three to six month period.   Each learner must complete the program in a maximum of six.  But what it does not say is whether the five days the theoretical days is included in the ten days.    And I – so I…    Well that is the only point I want to make.   Yes.   Yes.    That is what I understood as well Chair.    Because you know I am just trying in the sense to say.   That – and it was in answer to matters Mr Montana raised.    Where he said well it was longer than five days.  But we now know it is ten days and so we have 20 learners.  149 sessions and each learner to pay R24 000.00 for ten days.  That is – that is effectively. So it may not be five days but nevertheless it is R24 000.00 for ten days.    And if we can put a figure on that.    Finally Mr Montana on this contract can I just ask you who drew up this contract PRASA or Prodigy?    Okay.  I am going to suggest when one looks at this that it is a Prodigy document but that is neither here nor there because my next question is this.  Before you signed did you take legal advice from the PRASA people?    Yes.    Mr Montana you – you heard Chairperson say at the end of the day it does not matter who drew it up.  I am a lawyer I look at documents and I says between this company and this company who is likely to have drawn it up.  It was not an indictment of you and that specific to why I asked you did you take legal advice because I have indicated to you that Prodigy’s deliverables are not expressed and I – you have seemed to have conceded so when I ask you did you take legal advice it is simply on the basis that a R72 million contract should not be concludedwithout legal advice whoever drew up the contract.    Yes.  Mr Montana we must move on.  Can I now ask you to look at 14.2 please on page 102?    Yes.  This is Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit.     Can I ask you and I just want to be clear about this before you had made up your mind you had not talked to legal or human resource to dismiss Mr Dingiswayo, Ms Magoyi and the others.   As you please.  Mr Montana can I just ask you because I want to finish now with contracts well and I have raised one partner that involved Mr Moodley and you.  The question I want to ask you is do you know over the period of time that PRASA was in a contractual relationship with Prodigy what amount in total it paid to Prodigy?    It is something we ought to look at do you accept?    Let me ask you a voluted question  PRASAwould pay Prodigy because that was the complaint seemingly that was raised with your office whether you were aware of it and now that it had not been paid and PRASA would then as I understand what you have said claimed that money back from SETA.  As PRASA – while you were there did PRASA claim back all the money it was entitled to from SETA?    Sorry it is just one final question on the contracts itself.  I can get that in respect of training Prodigywas not the only contractor who could provide the type of training that PRASA needed.      Now the constitution and you must know this Section 217 says that when an organ of state procures goods or services it must do so in terms of a system that isfair, transparent and equitable and cost effective.  Was there any assessment of the cost efficacy of services that Prodigy was providing compared to other service providers?    Now. 
MR MONTANA:  Good morning Chair thank you very much.    Thank you, thank you Chair.    Chair I thought I was still under oath because I refused to do media interviews and said I am not I am under oath.  I could not even speak to my family Isaid I am still under oath.    Tshepo Lucky Montana.    No.    (Not audible).    Tshepo Lucky Montana.   No.    I do.    So help me God.    Indeed – indeed Chair.    Is that the one with the picture there?    I have got it Chair thank you.   Chair you will see in my affidavit which of course has not been considered I thought I will reject this it is not based on facts.  I think that the – Mr Dingiswayo statement in fact confirms some of the things that I amsaying in my affidavit but I will come to that later.    Chair it is laughable what he is – what he is saying there.  Because I want the CEO of – I was the CEO of PRASA and I was accountable for its performance to the board of PRASA so management had ultimately they supported me in fulfilling the mandate of the board.  They were not independent of me.  So if someone like Dingiswayo or Martha Ngoye wanted to have a life of their own and pursue something that I did not even instruct them to do or it was not in line with our strategy I had toact Chair.  So of course he does not describe what is the issue cross path – so I assume Chair that the – if he say cross path he mean if you do wrong things with me I will deal with it and I will take it in that spirit yes Chair.    No, no Chair I understand that.    Of course people who – who want to project themselves as corruption busters.   That is how they present themselves.    And in my affidavit    I am go into great lengths to explain.    In fact what Mr Dingiswayo all the things that he did.    That are not – that are not lawful.  And by the way Chair Mr Dingiswayo did not report to me.  I have never even given him a single instruction.    So very interesting that.   He can actually describe – even have own boss Ms Ngoye never described in those terms so it is very interesting that the – we are dealing with hearsay rather than fact.    Well Chair I think one of the major things it is very interesting that it starts by saying certain entities in fact I think that in my affidavit I demonstrate that – that in fact what he did in the legal department which he did not have the authority to abuse certain things but he abused it to target certain entities and leave others.So if he was acting consistently and said this is a principle – it is a policy of the company I would understand. But if he targets certain entities and say no this I – because you see Chair at this time it is quite clear that when Mr Molefe was there certain members of theexecutive when the relationship between and Mr Molefe collapsed certain people then aligning themselves and therefore they were used to – to do certain things which is…    With Mr Molefe.    In that instance.    Indeed Chair.    So – so you will see that if you go to another executive – so this is – there is a context to all of this but I do not agree with what he is saying Chair.    Yes no, no I – thanks Mr Soni.  Chair I just wish to emphasise again I deal with this issue in my own affidavit in great length and I want to say that the contract that Mr Dingiswayo talks about he was not actually in the employ of PRASA when this thing happened and it is very interesting when I read all the things you see that thisactually contrasts so much even with what I had written on this particular issues.The people who were there more specifically Mr Holele, Mr Mpefu Rakgoathe, Ms Koko who know the ins and outs of this particular matter did not file an affidavit and somebody who joins PRASA later just on hearsay and Werksmans investigation.  So it is hearsay it is not based on direct personal knowledge Chair but I think he had chosen to elevate it and let us deal with the facts of the matter Chair.   Well Chair it had a relationship with PRASA I do not where they are based I – I assume that is correct ja.   Well Chair I understand the matters arebetween – are in court and I think Prodigy is the one that took PRASA to court and for not honouring his agreement and payments in that regard.    Not at all Chair.  Again in my – in my own affidavit Chair I state the fact in response to what he is saying to Rule 3.3 that the – when we entered an agreement with Prodigy there was not actually any RoyMoodley and I think it was in 2010.  So I think he says in his affidavit that Roy Moodley became part of that company in 2012.    I think in page 5 well rather page 100.    Ja in 2012 he resigned Chair 1 s t of March.    2011 ja.    Thank you.    Dingiswayo.    Chair I do not know – I do not know…    Oh you mean the other shareholders in the business Chair.    I would not – I would not know their names Chair.   Says indeed Chair.    Well Chair it is interesting – it is very interesting because if you talk – you look at the company that I mentioned firstly Royal Security the bid adjudication of PRASA that included Mr Holele, Ms Ngoye recommended for the expansion of this particular contract.   So somebodycomes and recommend that these contracts be extended and then come to the commission and file an affidavit that these are irregularly – irregular Chair the – to take it further.  Chair in my affidavit are part of my annexures they actually show that the – that the strawberry contract was signed by the CEO of Intersite at that time and it was Ms Ngoye.  So – so it is very strange Chair that someone sits and you can see that at that time they did not have a problem now it is – things changes at PRASA there is a conflict between the Chair and the CEO.  They start to ridea whole range of things that – that they were actually part – they were central – I do not – I am a CEO I do not sit in a bid adjudication or bid evaluation.  These are the people who recommend.  So if somebody recommends Strawberry or recommends Royal Security or recommends Siyangena they were in the bid evaluation.  In fact Chair I need to – to move beyond that and say they have got a legal responsibility – a legal responsibility when they pick up any irregularity and advise whoever is going to approve – if it is going to be approved by the CEO within the delegationof authority they must say we picked up these things.  We think they are material or they are not material for me to know so that when I make a decision after being told and those have been elevated Chair on all of this – oh Swifambo and anything none of these bid evaluationcommittee members including Mr Holele and Ms Ngoye had elevated either to me or to the board why do they come to your commission today to say that we think that was irregular?  I was not there.  They were there.  They were dealing with the matters Chair.    Chair we were meant to meet today but because we set up the date.   We postponed .    But I think Chair we had committed to engage and resolve it as quickly as possible.    Thank you Chair.    No, no, not – not in respect of this Chair I think that the 11.6 is very specific allegation.  In 11.7 it is a completely different point but I know the fact that PRASA is going to court and what I have seen though affidavits that were filed where I think Prodigy was the applicant – I was not aware of the review application but PRASA is …    Yes but I – Mr Soni I just want to say that that very statement Chair is – on – in 12 it is false number 1 and number 2 here is someone who is going to tell us about the – about how these contracts were concluded yet he was not working for PRASA Chair when this thing was signed.  So maybe Mr Dingiswayo may want to bring somebody who told him this story that – because now weare dealing with someone who was not there – who is telling us – and if he says this comes from an investigation he must state that not as if he was – he was personally there because I am going to read out the part of my affidavit on this particular issue and you will see that these are completely two different worlds that exist.    Chair but I can say without interrupting Mr – I think that I assume the investigation referred to in 13 was done after – after I had left PRASA?   Chair the letter I know very well actually ithas got my handwritten notes – if I remember that vividly I will not even look at it.  It is my letter – it is a letter that    Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Chair I was trying to hide my affidavit and say that it is not – they have been admitted.    So I was 00   Thank you.  Thank you Chair I think that Iaddress it in a – and this.    This Chair are part of what I considered with regard to Rule 3.3.    And Regulation 10.6.    So I have included all of those as well into – into my affidavit.    Check the – I am just addressing four basic things here.    The first one of course I deal with the issue that the – Mr Soni raised the description that MrDingiswayo raised.    And I said the PRASA he describes it did not exist I do not even know it Chair.  But also indicating that I expected him to be a professional not to serve certain interests and in this particular case that is what he did and – and his target on my Mr Moodley actually Chair I deal with it at great length in terms of that.  Chair I -  I then go to – to indicate again that Mr Dingiswayo was not at PRASA when this conversation started – when thecontracts were put in place. Thirdly Chair I then go into detail to say how the process providing the genesis of this particular project that in fact it goes back to 2009 when – when Prodigy interacted with PRASA officials including Mr Mpefu Ramudwa [?] and Chair what it proposed in essenceis that it proposed a partnership because it was awarded what you call learnerships from the services SETA and he says look we have got learnerships for about 300 people to PRASA so that they – then we explore that in terms of the – on the people who service – on the services’ side or customer services’ side of the business.  We train them.  And this was a very unique proposal that they presented to us, Chair.     And we are happy.  We accepted and thatis why the letter that Mr Soni referred.  So it was then elevated to me.  Then I said, no, that actually is a great thing.  Let us ...[indistinct] with them, Chair.  And the partnership was developed, prepared by our legal department, Chair, at that time because it was Mr Lindikaya Zide.     Mr Dingiswayo was not here, at PRASA, Chair.  And it was developed fine.  And the training took place, Chair.    Ms Ngoye was not at PRASA – was not – it was in 2009/2010, she was not there, Chair.       She was not even there at all.  She wasnot - because I think she joined, if I remember and recall, Chair, she joined PRASA only in 2011 and she joined, not as a CEO or as an Executive, she actually was a – she left from Transnet in the Legal Department.  She joined our property arm and being the Head of the Office of the CEO at Intersite.  And Chair when the CEO left – because she was doing a lot of the work, she showed interest in the work and I am the one, Chair, who recommended that she gets appointed as the Executive, Chair.  So the people who say today I am a dictator, youcannot stand on my part, other people – all of them, Chair, were appointed by me.  Even Mr Dingiswayo.  When her first boss who joined us from, I think, Standard Bank recommended that she is keen.  He held interviews but he     She ...[intervenes]      Indeed, Chair.  After coming(?) fromIntersite and she was in the group position that she was, Group Legal Risk and Compliance, I recommended that she act because every time I will try – I will then pick up any of the executives.  Of course, that I do in consultation with the chair of the board and depending on the duration.  I will say so and so will act in a position.  Martha acted in a position, Chair.  But I did not realise how ...[indistinct] she was.  That we – she is no longer CEO of Intersite.  So when I allowed her to act into that position in December 2014 that is when she went onthe defensive with Mr Molefe to investigate me, to try and find all sorts of things that were there.  But again, all of them were – all of them, Chair, I wanted them here at the Commission.  I prove each of these to be false and founded, Chair.  I have got my own witnesses as a human being but the ones that I am accused of in these pages, Chair, are totally false, Chair.  All of us as human beings, we have got our own faults.  I have got mine but the ones that I mention here, Chair, are part of an agenda to try anddiscredit me and at the heart of it, were people who met with Mr Molefe behind my back to try and build a case and I demonstrate that in the course of the conversation, Chair.     Chair, finally, because you interrupted. The final point, Chair.  You know, value for money.  I was part with ministers on the ...[indistinct] with the trade unions.  When the first group of people were trained were being recognised because this recognise is big.  For employees who do not have matric, who do not have qualification, this was a major thing.       The training ...[intervenes]      ...that was done by Prodigy.  And becauseit was accredited widely, Chair.  Employees and particular our customer services, the staff, they loved it, Chair.  Lastly on this issue, Chair.  We even received an international award.  I just – I wanted to bring it and leave it here Chair.  Which our Customer Services Executive in our range division went to receive overseas which was for innovation, for excellence, Chair.  Today, as I come here, Chair, employees, the     From KZ...  Indeed, Chair.     [Indistinct] [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Yes, I think that is a good point, Chair.  But I was changed(?).  You see, the problem at PRASA, Chair is because people thought at the beginning, they thought the Gupta’s are so much at PRASA.  When they realised the Gupta’s are not at PRASA because we said no, then they had to find something else.  They did not stop and said the Gupta’s are not there.  They actually thought the Gupta’s were involved with President Zuma in the PRASA Rolling Stock Programme.  Chair, the reality is that there was no PresidentZuma, there were no Gupta’s at PRASA.  I stood my ground and all the records, Chair, even when we discussed in Parliament in the Parliamentary Inquiry into Governance at Eskom, I dealt with the Gupta’s story.  Minister Dan Martins came to confirm all of that.  So there were no Gupta’s but people thought we are captured by the Gupta’s.  They are not my friends, Chair.  I mean, even the – I have never – you know, people tell me they went to the Gupta’s compound, eat, worked there, carry and otherthings you were told Chair.  Chair, where I used to stay, I am in the – I was in the same street as Duduzane Zuma and the Gupta’s were in the corner.  They have never been to my house.  I have never been to their house and I have never asked for any favours from them Chair in my entirelife.  And this has to do with my own upbringing Chair.  My parents will frown upon me, you know, going after people to ask for favours instead of doing things in a proper way.  So I am not saying, the Commission can point     But Chair, on a lighter note, I have asked and urge that you do make a finding that Mr Montana is such a good fellow.       I think such a finding in the final report, Chair, would help the country to ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chair.     We are in MM ...[intervenes]      That is correct, Chair.    Oh, the letter from my signature.  Acknowledging receipt and confirming our acceptance of the proposal from Prodigy.       Indeed, Chair.     [Indistinct]      Indeed Chair.     Yes, Chair.     I confirm, Chair ...[intervenes]      ...that this is the letter and those were the notes written by me, Chair.     [Indistinct]      Chair, you are not granted actual money.     Ja.     Exactly, exactly Chair.     Exactly.     That amount.     Chair, the – what would happen is that then once the training has happened ...[intervenes]      ...then you are able to claim that money...[intervenes]      ...from that particular ...[intervenes]      Which they have put aside.  So they will come and say we have entered into, let us say, a partnership.     Whether with the SAPS or with PRASA.    We are doing this training.  Once you are satisfied and all of those things – and PRASA, even if you to pay, Chair, is able to recover that money from that claiming processes.    Ja.     No, Chair, it was still paying.     Because remember when you are – you enter into a partnership.     You may – because you remember whenwe say we used the 300 to pilot that – what do you call it - Centre of Excellence and the Centre of Excellence was here.  We built it there, just behind Park Station here.       So then it provides training beyond that.  So there would be costs that PRASA would carry as well in the process and if we increase and if you look at the addendum, for example, the addendums will say we think this is benefiting the company.     Then let us add additional numbers.  Then those – it will not come from the Seta.  It will then come directly from us, Chair.     So we will incur costs as well as PRASA.    Indeed, Chair.     No, no.  Even both, Chair.     If you look at it, for example - what happened, there was a big fight on this issue.       After I have sighed, there was an agreement and then the initial 300 flew – I think that they flowed quite nicely.     When the addendum was signed for the next group and I think the numbers would then increase in that respect, there was quite a lot of disagreementbetween PRASA managers and Prodigy in respect of that particular contract.  In the first place, Chair, what happened is that Prodigy then paid – carried a lot of the costs because they     Chair, I think we decided to use theprogramme to train our entire customer services’ teams.     Throughout the country.     To widen the scope.    Because he said    The majority are working at stations.     Why do you deal with only 300 people.     And this had been well received by employees who were trained who received the certificate.    So we think that it is something we should go on with the programme.     So that was not part of the original letter ...[intervenes]      ...that was presented to us, Chair.     So that, PRASA would carry for thetraining, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     No, no Chair.  No.     That is correct, Chair.     It is correct, Chair.     You are on page?     Ja?       Ja, I think – it is correct, ja.     Ja, Chair.    No, Chair but what I know is that PRASA itself would claim from – because it is ...[indistinct] you would recall.  And I think in terms of our target at that timefor the number of the people we train, I think it should be per annum 2% of the workforce for all the training that are subjected to, whether from the transport Seta or from the any other Seta who had done the training.  We had the right, Chair, to do that and even from a taxpayer perspective, Chair, we could do that.  Of course, PRASA was not a tax paying entity.  It is still not as far as I know.  But two of its subsidiaries, Top Pax(?) and Intersite they can put that on – they can claim that from the tax point of view.  The initial cost, Chair, when we were waiting and there was a still a lot of bickering – I know that Prodigy did want to claim from us but it had carried certain costs at the beginning but we said but those you can claim directly from the Seta but that was the briefing that I would get from theteam, Chair, as the project.  It was doing – implemented over a period of time.       Chair, I think if you look it for Prodigy, it offered that to us.  I think that one of the things – you will see in the Dingiswayo affidavit was that this thing was supposed to go out on tender.  But a partnership meanssomebody is bringing something to the table and you agree on the value of thereof.  And if we agree to pilot the Centre of Excellence through using that learnership programme, Chair, it is quite that Prodigy will get the extra work as a result beyond the - that is the – so it goes – that is a business decision that you have to make, as it were, and I supported it on that basis.     Chair, what happens is that the – there may be programmes for example that the SETA may say – may initiate or PRASA may initiate in the fund but most of the training, Chair, we must budget for it.  We budget for training as PRASA, we spend the money and then there is a time, there is a process where we then apply to get back part of the money we spent.  I think there is a formula they use.     So you train people and then they give you the money based on that, Chair.     We train people.     Indeed, Chair.    No, no, Chair, that is why even in theletter there that you are able to get part of that allowance.     And it depends also on the nature of the training, I mean, you get accredited programme.     But let us say a transport SETA is approved then they give you the full amount for that, Chair.     No, sorry, Mr Chair, you left me behind, I still busy with the letter.     You left me behind, Chair, I do not know where you are going.     Back at page 101?     That is correct, Chair.     The partnership agreement, Chair, I signed, yes.    Ja, I confirm that, Chair, that is correct.     179?     Indeed, Chair.     What …[intervenes]     I am trying to – ja, on page 174.     Right at the bottom, okay.     That is the agreement that we have beenlooking at that was signed by you.     Exactly, Chair.     Indeed, Chair.     All the training, Chair, PRASA would be able to claim for all the monies that – you remember this is now moving beyond the 300, Chair, that we spoke about earlier, ja.     No, no, no, Chair.  It will not be SETA, itwill be PRASA that pays and will claim the money from the skills lady, as it were.     Chair, PRASA will claim – will still claim even …[intervenes]     PRASA will still claim for anything.  Any training that we do.     PRASA will claim the money for that training.     No, no, Chair.  What has happened here is that – let me explain, Chair.  One of the DVD(?) they say we want – we are giving you the learnerships.  It meansthat money, Chair, that has been allocated for training is given to you.     PRASA, which is PRASA.     But let us say they have got their own list.     The database of their suppliers who present different training programmes.They have approved some and no approved some and these service providers will decide, Chair.  If you look in my, for example, affidavit, we deal with some of the training that Prodigy was doing for other agencies of the State.  But they went to the SETA, get that learnerships and theyaward and they allocate them.  Now the training will happen, Chair.   Now in this particular instance I have said – the point I made was that Prodigy then because of what was happening, it carried the cost, the initial cost of the training programme and when they wanted to claim from us they said no, but you have got – we have not yet come to that point, you can carry the cost until such time that we are able to – because you recall, Chair, this is the middle of the financial year.  Not all the cost – we had to shift thecost for training from other training to allocate to this particular training. So, Chair, each and every training we do, even if we end up we paid someone, it means therefore that we can claim that money from the SETA.    Indeed, Chair.     No, Chair, in both instances PRASA would spend the money.     Knowing that there is an agreement.     That letter that training has been ceded to it by Prodigy in this instance and that it goes on with the training knowing that there is 18 million in the kitty that it can claim back and to come back to PRASA.     Chair, you will see that in the first part but with the annexures, with the addendum rather, it is a completely different thing because we are dealing with – and let me say the 6 000 per learner…    You remember that it is for a specific approved programme.     Now what has happened in the Centre of Excellence, PRASA and Prodigy then engage and agreed on the nature of the programme that needs to be done.  Okay, so that goes far beyond what, for example, was initially provided in the SETA award.Secondly, Chair, PRASA did not only train, it usedthat training to train also people outside of its own ranks.  For example, we were working with a number of community organisations.  So we say nominate people and bring them – let us also train them into part – so the numbers will go and they will get certification as well.    It is in line with whatever was providedthere.     Chair, but ultimately …[intervenes]     There are two types of things, Chair, that perhaps I should explain.  There will be something like this where these guys will come and say we have got learnerships from SETA X, we have got this amount of money, can we use it at PRASA?     And then there is the ongoing targets that we have in terms of training.  Now this is not a training – so over and above what Prodigy had proposed, PRASA had its own target in terms of training people which it also claimed from the Transport SETA as an example, Chair.    No, no, Chair, the SETA will still claim themoney but remember, the 18 million is linked to 300 learners.  The specific basic training – that is for basic training that is there.  We took a decision that okay, we are going to have – we develop what you call My Station programme which was a programme to prepare our people.  We said we are modernising PRASA, we need to have new employees, it cannot be only about new trains.  Even the people at stations and all the things, they must people who can respond to the challenges of the time.So we designed a completely new programme whereemployees will come from all over the country and train.  So what happens is that the 3 000 and the 300, it is not one and the same thing, Chair, and now I realise that perhaps what we should have done, with hindsight, we should not have called that an addendum(?).  It shouldhave been dealt with basically as a – to say let us build on the centre but we enter a completely different agreement because I understand, Mr Soni, when you ask that question, is that you initiated a programme based on the 300 and then you build on it, the numbers keep on increasing, the value keeps on going up but the amount, all of it, we are allowed to claim back from the SETA, Chair.     Indeed.  I think that, Chair, if it is a same programme, it is the same basis training and that has been increased in that way, yes, I think as a head of the SETA I would be intrigued.  But if it is a completely different programme I would say look, we are building on that, we are opening this centre, we are providing – I mean, one ofthe things that we did, for example, in our centre, Chair, was to, in respect of the training for train drivers, we brought in one of the sophisticated machines where are drivers were trained – I think the word will come back now in my head – where similar to what you do when you trainhigh loads or whatever, Chair, you create an environment where if drivers are driving a train, there is a lot of rain or whatever, so some of it highly advanced training programmes that comes into our Centre for Excellence.   So it was no longer the same training programme, we built onto that, it was a much more sophisticated detailed programme that is there.  I think the word will come back, Chair, so that when you create a  - what is the word, it disappeared again from me – so pilots, for example, Chair, when they are trained, there is an artificialsituation created as part of that training.  We did the same, for example, the Centre of Excellence.   It is not far, I have visited it quite a number of times I have addressed the employees who are attending that particular programme and the others took place around the country, as it were.  So Mr Soni is correct, Chair, but if it is the same terms, same training, yes, it should not do but it is a different training, we used that programme to expand and bring as many people as possible and get the advanced training.  That is what we chose to do, Chair, andthat was the innovation and the award that we got for the programme.     So this was negotiated between Prodigyand our HR department but because the numbers and the amounts were huge, required the approval of the CEO and that is why, Chair, you will see that when you see the work, what you referred to me, Mr Soni, the page 174, my signature.  After …[intervenes]     174, I think, Chair, ja, where I – no, 177, sorry.     177, it is my signature there.    As you can see, Chair, that there are PRASA who signed.  Who signed but because there are numbers are not the same as the numbers that were part of that initial scheme, it then required the approval of the Group CEO, Chair, and I have accordingly approved that because it was within my delegation of authority.     Yes, Chair, but I think …[intervenes]     Ja, Chair, but I can see that on page, for example, 176.  So this was a memo.  Let us check in the front page who would have – okay, this is the actualagreement but there will be a memo accompanying this agreement.     Explaining to me.     So but because it has budgetary impact beyond what was initially agreed, the team would motivate for me to sign and, Chair, that is why I accordingly approved.     Approved the …[intervenes]     The draft agreement, Chair.     The draft – Chair, there are two main players here.  Our HR department is the one that deals with the training issue.  I am speaking as if, Chair, I am still at PRASA.  At that time, Chair…     So the – they will deal with the actual business of the training including the claiming from the scheme, that is an ongoing part of their functions.  The drafting of this and the vetting of the agreement will then be done by our legal department.    Which then both of them will be submitted to me, motivating – if I am unhappy of course I will not approve but if I am happy and I believe that there is value for money then I will approve like in this instance, Chair, I did approve.       I was giving that as an example, Chair.    For some of the trainings …[intervenes]     Chair, the training for the initial group was what you call a basic training customer service forpeople to understand the importance of customer services in the business and all of those things.  I does not take you to the level where you acquire skills that could even take high in the organisation.     No, Chair, during the …[intervenes]     During the 2006 World Cup, you remember the Germans were trained how to smile because they were regarded as people who are very serious and we were going to their country for the 2006 World Cup.  So, Chair, it will be basic about how do you treat your customers, your …[intervenes]     To a customer.  But these were basic, part of the initial learnerships that were there.    So it was basic, basic training that was there.     But the awards that we did, Chair, werestill accredited, though.     For the 300.     Yes.     So it is like someone who you are sending for a basic training course, they get their acknowledgement.   The second part, Chair, was a much more detailedone because it also teaches you about your business, the management of processes and all of those processes.  So the entire value chain about customer services and some of the technical skills that you require, Chair.     Yes, Chair, the - for example, access controllers, the people that you find when you come into astation, the people who check your tickets, the first programme was targeted at those kind of people.     When you look at the second part of the programme, some of them targeted management – oh, by the way, access controllers but also the unemployed people, Chair, they got on that programme, people who are unemployed, organisation like South African commuter organisations will nominate people let us say from Orange Farm and everything and say we think that we will workwith commuters, we want these kind of basic skills and our people get certificates.  So that we will do, Chair, but when you look at the one that was costing on an average 24, you are even targeting higher people including those at the entry to management level, Chair, that were being trained.  So that is why the cost would not have been the same, it would not have been the same level.  Even the intensity, Chair, because a two week basic programme will not be the same where a programme you run over a period of six months but again, it is dependent on releasing of people.    Because one of the major things is that if you do it in modules because there are modules in these programmes, you find that one of the major things I remember was a big, big problem in this programmebetween our HR team and our customer services team, was with Prodigy, was the fact that PRASA signed an agreement but it does not release the people that have been identified to require this kind of programme.So they will say we, for example, have booked a place, we also secured facilitators who pitch up and sometimes there is half of the people that we require there and we have to do the programme twice or thrice because the same number of people instead of coming to one session, they come to two or three different sessions thatare there.  So, Chair, they were not the same programme.  So the first one targeted access controllers, Chair, mainly, within the Metrorail environment.  When I went to the Eastern Cape, Chair, for a road show with employees, I remember employees there who said why, we are part of Shosholoza Meyl, the intercity long distance, why are we not also being given the same kind of training?  And I remember that as a result of that, they head of Shosholoza Meyl operations, not the CEO but the guy who running operations, I think Mr NelsonMphailane, then wrote a letter requesting that, no, we have got our own people who must – who should be nominated and participate in the programme, as it were.   So, Chair, there is a – I think there were a lot of ups and downs in the programme but was it a great programme forPRASA?  I think, as CEO, I will say it was one of the best programmes that were further implemented and that is why when in fact I was to travel to Vienna at the time Chair but I could not travel and one of our many executives travelled there to receive the award because the impact of that programme on making sure that you do not only modernise, because the key thing Chair is modernisation, that you are modernising your operations but the employees are not prepared, they needed to create a new person, a new employee, to be able to match to merge all of that. So the centre of excellence, my station program, and the centre of excellence was aimed at achieving that Chair.  I do not know today as to whether PRASA is getting the benefit of those trainings, except that I did get a call from one of the Union saying you have trained our people, they did not get their own certificates.  What is happening, can these service provider provide and deliver that to us?  But I said well that is a matter between PRASA and Prodigy to resolve, particularly with the disputes and the Court processes that are underway.  Chair there was valuefor money, I was satisfied it was a good program for us.     No, no examples I have given you examples Chair that you have models that run over, for example over a two-week program, for example over six and you would not manage them the same Chair.  But the first was for access controllers, basic training, and the other ones Chair moved to even the management excellence, entry level management excellence in our service, in our customer services part of the business.      No, no, Chair not off hand.      But I know that when I visited, I was still given the files for training, and I still have them Chair and maybe it is something that I should share with the Commission to be able to evaluate this program Chair.     Are you on page 175?     174?    No, no I do not – no I am trying to see where in his affidavit is he saying, I am trying to…[intervene]     No, no Chair that that cannot be correct and I think Mr Dingiswayo is really trying to find fault in the program.  When you go into my affidavit Chair one of the things that I did not share, for example, you will see that even there has been quite a lot of engagement, some of the PRASA HR people who wanted for example, this program to be linked with some of the more advanced programs that were there and I think I detail some of those.So the program Chair that was there was far bigger than that Chair and I am trying to find the specific part Chair on the - in my affidavit.  For example, one of the things is that our HR department and something that I intervened and fight about wanted Prodigy to enter into ajoint venture with another company called Talent Institute, which was already doing work for PRASA and say let us consolidate these particular programs.  And that is why I am saying Chair if you apply the same principle, Mr Dingiswayo will say for example, we think let us say Talent Institute, which has been with PRASA doing work for PRASA for many years, which I actually questioned to say hey, are these people the only guys who are training in this environment?  So there were part because - you know, businesses the way they runChair, people create their own spaces, their own freedom because they get comfortable working with other people and they want to create all of that spaces.  But Chair, the program was far bigger and that is why I shared the program – I shared the material so that the Commission will be able to see that, I think that what Mr Dingiswayo was trying to get to, is to try to reduce everything to that entry level program, and not deal with the program in its entirety and its complexity, Chair.  But I think the training material that I provide, willprove that they in fact, the higher you go there the complex     No, no.    Chair, when we - when the first group of people graduated training, we were actually wearing gowns, because this was accredited - with 300 employees, I still have pictures, some of our employees there, they wrote letters to me Chair, which are employees who have never been to school, but were taken through this program, and they felt quite, you know, that they are – here is a business that is taking care of them, and that they even them they throughout they can gain the experience to gothrough the system and be something else.  Because once you got the first one, it means Chair that he in fact, you can also be nominated for the higher forms.  So it was aimed at ensuring that you do not become an access controller for the rest of your life, Chair.  Let me say lastly Chair, that when I joined the SRCC and we incorporated Metrorail in 2006, one of the biggest problems we found was that there were a lot of employees who have worked for Metrorail, I think the numbers was plus minus 4000. They have worked some of them for 10 to 12 years, they were treated as temporary staff.  They never received this kind of training and most of those people became access controllers because I went to the Board and say here is the financial implications but these people cannever be access controllers, temporary employees for the rest of their life.  So we then incorporated, they became access controllers, and most of them became part of this program.  When we made them a full time Chair, you would not believe how that changed people's lives.  For the first time someone is able to go to a bank and say I am applying for a student loan for my kids, I am able to apply for a home.  Fortunately, I was receiving those, those letters there and I said, for me, that is what made me wake up Chair and lookforward to going to work at PRASA because I knew that my employees -  I mean, when I came here Chair on Friday, the messages they sent to me, some of them were saying [speaking in vernacular], whatever they say we have got a permanent job, we have got a roof over our heads for the first time, because you fought for us in that business. So Chair, I think maybe anomalies will always be contradictions a source of development and we should not be afraid of that but I think for me the question and I was not involved, because these people are not trained by me. I went to open maybe one or two of the sessions that were there. In the same way that when our employees for example, some of the senior managers we targeted we send them to Gibbs to be trained, because this is what we saying that we wanted you to become now the next level ofleadership in the organisation.  Now before Gibbs, take them through the business training, I come then tell them what is PRASA, what kind of business are we trying to do and Chair we dedicated a bit of time for that.  So yes, anomalies may be there but was it a good program for our entry level staff at customer services and later for the management echelons at the entry level, I think Chair it was one of the best programs ever.  I do not agree with Mr Dingiswayo’s assessment but yes, I think his got the right to identify shortcomings thatwere there but it does not make them criminal.  I think for him Chair his trying to link the training to Moodley and that is the problem.  If you start in that way, we are going part ways because there was no Moodley when I signed that letter.  So I am taking responsibility that this program, ultimately, there are employees that passed, that GM’s who approved certain things Chair but the overall program was endorsed by me as a Group Chief Executive and I am confirming that to you Chair, today.    No, no this came after the World Cup.     No, no.     But this was linked to creating the new business.  So remember before 2010 Chair, 2010 was very important for us, because we had invested a lot, but we did not create the new PRASA, Chair.  We were refurbishing and one of the major things post 2010 we took a very important strategic decision that we no longer want to refurbish old trains, we do not want to paint the old trains that we know that they do not represent the future.  We are going to capitalise thisbusiness, we want to recapitalise so we said we are moving away from refurbishment to recapitalisation, instead of refurbishing trains – it does not mean we are not going to refurbish at all but the key thrust we are going to invest in new trains, Chair, we took that decision. The result of that is that factory that we see in Dunnottar in Nigel where you know Chair I was so proud when I saw His Excellency, our President, taking investors and say South Africa has got a manufacturing plant and I know Chair that I was the champion behind that, and when I see investors say, if you want to build a trains, not only for South Africa, but for even countries in the Southern Hemisphere like Brazil, like Australia, South Africa can actually build those trains in the factory that we built.  You know, one thing Chair why I defend PRASA so vehemently,I said people come in here and say money was paid, okay.  It was paid even in advance but we do not see any value.  Chair, I want to assure you, there is no single PRASA project whether you deal with this new rolling stock, you deal with the farm boy, you deal with Prodigy, where you find that we spend money and you cannot show and say this is what we did.  With Swifambo for example the country can say here are the locomotives we are using them, and other saying they are too tall. They are not saying they are no locomotives; they're running in thetracks.  The commuter trains we spent R50billion, we can show them, we can point them - the training Chair, I took Minister Ndebele the first 300 of the employees that were trained by Prodigy. Minister Ndebele in Boksburg. Heactually was the main speaker, and he was surrounded – pictures are there, this is actual work we did not just take people and pretended and put down, this were our employees Chair who benefited from that particular program. So I think Chair, that is the one difference about PRASA the point - as point the shortcomings, and there are probably many, but there are also many achievements that we have recorded, but we will never have an instance where you say Chair, like you say but money has beenspent and we do not know, at PRASA I can take you, you can walk with me Chair anywhere and say we spend R100million there here  is the result of all of that and that is why I will always be an Ambassador for PRASA, even if I do not work for that organisation, Chair. Even now with the difficulties, let me indicate Chair, now with the difficulties I have said to the Board of PRASA I am not looking for work but I have offered Chair I said I am prepared to give you two or three days, even if I do not come to the office, sitting from home.  If you want me toanalyse some of your reports, and advise on the kind of strategies, I am available because this is our country Chair, I do not want to see PRASA going down because I am no longer CEO, I want to see PRASA thriving, because first and foremost, I am thinking about our Parkwood,Woolworths. So I keep on buying their Chair, the employees look at me and sometimes I take my daughter, they play with my daughter.  One day as I was leaving Parkwood recently Chair, they all crowded, they were crowding me and I thought I was going to be beaten by these employees and they were saying but we live in Soweto and we used to take a train from Naledi to Park Station and then take a short taxi and that we could save a lot of money for our families. Trains are no longer there, we are paying even double more than our salary just to go to work.  So, Chair those are the people that we - that I think about.  So the country has given me some skills, I may be fighting with the leadership today but the skills I will use to the benefit of our people and I made that offer Chair not to the Minister but to the Board and say if one day you feel that I should assist you feel free to come and give me the material.  And for example now the infrastructure has goneChair, we need to restore it and I think that is something that I am prepared – if you find and you may find serious findings against me Chair, I am not saying you would perhaps one of the of the things as a mitigating factors say had committed to continue working for the country, say,five years, we sentence you, instead of hard labour, go and assist the country in railways, that is what I will do Chair.     Chair, I put my head on the block, each and every manual project that we have done that were within my monitoring screen, all of them Chair have been done.  They are not perfectly but I think that we have done tremendous work and part of me coming to this Commission is to ensure that the true story of PRASA is told Chair and not to deny any shortcomings orweaknesses but to say the real PRASA known amongst our people should be the one that we present here today, Chair.    174.    Answering the question (inaudible) R72 million Chair.    I accept Chair I do.    Which I rejected.    Chair perhaps not in the – in that level of detail but I will tell you from where I was sitting some of the things other than the training of course.  You remember there was also catering for all our employees that were there and Chair I think – I think maybe what Mr Dingiswayo confused Iam not responding to him but I am just answering you in that way was the fact that there were some levels where we were doing a lot of theoretical training.   There were – and I think that is when we brought in people together into one place which I think the total days for example for that period we are training was – was in the order of twenty days.  The – one of the things for example on this program Chair particularly where we were dealing with I think the management levels.  If I remember well it was Level – Level 4 and 5.  Once they have gone through the program then Prodigy for example will assign what we call a mentor to be able to make sure that what this person has been trained is able to apply that in the work space.  So – so the point I am making Chair I am saying that maybe his did not but I thinkthat for me I had an understanding of what this program needs to deliver.  Whether they did that fully, completely Chair it is a different matter but – but when we approved this program and Chair let – by the way I am reminded of one thing or rather two things.      Chair yes but if you look at the – if you look at the table Chair you have got the project activity, you got deliverables and at the end it tells you who is responsible. Kadishe – that is Mr Soni where it says Prodigy is responsible for that, Prodigy is responsible for that then say Prodigy and PRASA so I think perhaps maybe Chair we – we – the way it has been captured it may not have been – I would concede to that – I will not take issue with that.  But I think that from the table that Mr Soni is referring to it actually has got three sections activity, deliverables and the responsible party in that agreement.    Chair maybe Chair I think for me it is very clear.      Chair – Chair I think – look at the time when I look at the – I hear what Mr Soni is saying but at the time you it says the theoretical issue which means the theoretical part of the training.    For – will take – it would be for five days and 149 groups of 20 learners each and Chair it tells you the kind of activity that is supposed to take place there and that – and that that theoretical work Chair if so – if they arecalled for five days but over a period of six months Chair they do that training.   The point that I think Mr Soni is making that the contract maybe does not provide and I have said that there are disputes for example about the release of – ofemployees by PRASA and you will see there is a grey area where PRASA said but it was her job to make sure that the – you ask for them.  And this guy say but it was your duty to make sure that as an employer that they are released.   So yes there are those kinds of grey areas Chair but I think that in terms of clear deliverables I think that the – as far as I am concerned Chair they are quite detailed in this.  And by the way let us not look at what we have in front of us Chair an isolation from the partnership agreement as well as the thing because this is just a detailed activity now beyondwhat we – what I had signed.   Because the partnership agreement I signed did not have that level of detail Chair but if you go further down with the addendums and even the amounts those are detailed in the – in the contracts.  Are they covered enough that if there is that kind of a problem I will concede Chair I would take up issues with that.  I would not – I would not argue that it is that.    No, no, no Chair. No. no.    No, no.  Okay let us correct that.  Chair Ithink we are picking up.    His understanding.    Now I am giving my understanding.    Chair no the program was not ten days for R24 000.00.  We are talking about the theoretical path of – your remember that talking about the number of otheractivities for examples those at Level 4 and 5. They will not do the stuff but they will do entry things to management as one example Chair.   So – so this type – this ten days we are referring to – we are referring to the groups – the 149 groups of 20 learners each which they can I think Chair you summarised it properly that the theoretical part could be less than ten days in five days.   So it means people must come together at one place for that theory for that week and then come later on.  But ifyou look at the entire activity we are talking about an activity of cause for specifically their theoretical session.  They say it will take between three to six months.   Now that is not – that paragraph does not define the totality of the training Chair it is – it refers to a specificaspect of the program.  The program was – was if you look at that I mean people were – people were trained some of them for a period of over a year.  So – so I am simply saying that do not reduce this training to that block.  That block simply suggest a – one activity amongst many Chair.   That is why I was saying earlier on one of the things that I will do because I will not go through each one of them.  I mean when you place a mentor you train Lucky Montana    Yes this was a theory training part Chair.    The theory only. And the other activities Chair you will see that they are…    Yes they say that the – that – so which means a session – one session – so if we define that for five days so that will be a session.  So it says that so it could be this would be a ten day program and I think you summarised correctly Chair when you said it means one session could befive days and you come later on and do another five days.    No Chair my understanding Chair is that you have the ten days the entire ten days even if you do them intwo blocks of five days – five days is the theoretical part.  It does not involve the practical part of the program.    That is why I am saying to Mr Soni that that block – that box that he is referring to is not a totality of the program.  For example if you deal with mentors and I think that there is a full range of activities Chair in the – you see Chair this addendum is actually trying to give effect to the partnership agreement.  Because that detail you will not find it in the partnership agreement and I think Chair that the –so I am simply saying that you will see that when you go through each and every box you are find the project activity beyond the ten days for theory and that the – the other activities is not listed in that box.  So the R24 000.00 does not relate to that box it refers to people would have beentrained over a period I will say between three months to a year into that program with a ten days only on theory particularly for those entry levels Chair.    Chair I provide some of those – that detailin my annexures.    In my affidavit so I think that – I will send the things separately.    To enhance that understanding Chair thank you.    Chair I think the contract was – was drawn up by Mr Lindikaya Zide who as the company secretary and was responsible for legal things in PRASA and that is the submission – that is where I got it Chair.  So whether they drafted it or vetted it I think – ja – but it came from there.   Yes Chair.  Chair I think let me actually give you the process that we follow because…    So the answer is yes but let me take this opportunity to indicate how we – how we – you see for me as CEO I deal with a lot of things and when somebody deals with a program they want to – to motivate for its approval.  They write memos Chair.  They put together a memo motivating also the – put in for that wants a benefit for a business whether we have got a budget for it and all of those things Chair.  And the legal advice you will you – the legal people will you tell you for example and say no we are not – we are not happy with it Chair.  In some instances and I think when we deal maybe with the Siyangena matter you will see for example Chair that we for the later contracts we use a standard contract that is used for example in the industry.  We sign that contract.  Someone would say it does not come from PRASA but that is different Chair to – to – you know this one is different because we did it.  If you look at when I deal with the Werksmans issue Chair when you look at the letter of engagement that PRASA signed that was signed by Mr Nathi Khena is a letter that is written by Werksmans on its letterhead.   It provides the time and everything and what PRASA did was say sign and the person who signed on behalf of PRASA Nathi Khena he did not even sign it receiving it fromthe legal team.  He signed it at the – at the restaurant in a shop.  So – so Chair this is in my affidavit.   So I think that maybe what Mr Dingiswayo Chair was trying to say was that when he came he found this in place but I think it would be better if the commission were toactually ask the former head of legal, the former company secretary Mr Linkiya ZIde and say were you involved, did you draft this contract and all of those things?  It came from there Chair and I am saying I am giving the commission a specific name.   This Mr Mphephu Ramuda who was our acting HR executive. Let us ask him Chair.  There is a lady in Cape Town who was part of the customer services team Ms Valerie – I cannot recall her surname we were part of all of those things Chair and I think each of these employees can beasked to depose to an affidavit to the commission and they will see – you will see Chair that between the time we started and maybe the time that Mr Dingiswayo dealt with this matter it is a completely different worlds Chair.   So Mr Soni made Chair a very serious statement that it is a Prodigy document not a PRASA document and of course I am the one whose being asked questions I should not be asking questions but I thought it will be fair if Mr Soni were to tell me the basis of his statement Chair.  Is he saying that I was – I was misled as CEO with this document? So we need to find out what exactly is a concern Chair because I am saying as a CEO I am taking responsibility for this.    Chair you know Chair my – part of the problem that difficulty with people working with me I like to get into detail and I write.    And that is why when I come to the commission I cannot say hey it was junior employee who signed.  I signed and that is why I can talk about it here.  So Chair I will assure you that if it means I stay the whole night reading this thing that is what I will do and if I am not happy with it I will indicate change there and there and I am satisfied here Chair the Prodigy make business. They were not doing this thing for Mahala Chair.  There is no doubt that Prodigy was doing business.  Do you think we got – we are getting the benefit of this program?  I am saying that I amsatisfied there that we did.    Yes Chair.    Mr Soni I did not concede that the deliverables – the deliverables are here Chair and I think that we have how many pages of deliverable?  I have said that we have got a document which indicates one project activity deliverables and responsibilities.  At the end…    Absolutely – absolutely Chair.   Absolutely Chair.    Yes.   Person ja.    102?    Affidavit ja.  Page 102.  That is where I am, Chair.    Ja.     Well, Chair, I was not but my – later onwhen I saw some of the documents in respect of this matter, I noted that point, Chair.     Chair, I am saying that I saw that tin the documents.  I do not know what was driving it but you will, for example, that when I answered that question later, I deal with it later.  I think, in fact, Chair, I deal with it in my affidavit that what has happened here.  Mr Dingiswayo is describing a specific processwith people at the SCM but I am suggesting that beyond that, there was something where they have identified and he said, certain entities and had then allocated to himself powers to block, for examples, contracts that were there that he felt were irregular and it was not doing thatconsistently.  So the interaction – in fact, in one of my emails, I am not sure if they have attached – if it is attached here, Chair.  I take up issues with him and with Mr Khuzwayo.  And I will take you there.  It is my email has been attached, Chair.  Because already at that time, we were honestly ...[indistinct].  Things were happening that you would go to Legal or Legal would come and say we have reviewed this contract and decided that this contract is irregular.  ThenFinance would then be told do not make payments.  That is not how an organisation works, Chair.  Legal is a supporting function.  It does not run the business.  Legal, for example, they would advice business, the people who are running that particular project and in this particular case it will be Group HR, Human Capital Management.  And if I am happy they will then elevate that     Chair, I did see the email exchanges ...[intervenes]      ...between the – not only the two of them but a number of people.  But who initiated it?    I would not say with certainty, Chair.     No, Chair.  No, he never raised with me.     Are you referring to the last sentence ...[intervenes]      ...of 14.2?     [No audible reply]      No, Chair.  I cannot recall exactly Chair.     I am not denying it but I cannot recall ...[intervenes]      [Indistinct] perfectly.     Chair, I was not aware but let us assume 14.3 is correct, Chair.     It was not up to mister – it was not up to him to decide whether to draft or not.     That is why he had a duty to elevate to the right person and to engage business and if as a business we come to the conclusion that we are agree with what – the concerns you are raising, then it is fine.  But Mr Dingiswayo in his position as a General Manger did nothave the authority to say what he is saying in 14.3.  It – if we are – we run a business that way, Chair, then we are going to have a problem.     Well, Chair, I am saying firstly.  He had a right to raise to those concerns ...[intervenes]       ...that he said he had identified.    But the decision is not his.     He had to decide, for example to say    And if there is an agreement there, then that is the route to take.    That is where it ends.  If they say    Chair, when we – when the former Group Executive for Legal who was – who brought Fani Dingiswayo to the business, left the company.  We said – we reached an agreement that we would part ways.  We had a separation agreement.  This was facilitated by ourHR, Group HR function together with Legal.  So this was done.  So we signed.Then we reached agreement that should go – then we will part ways on certain terms.  We signed and everything went...  Then – she then came back, the     ..the Chair so that you understand what is my objection on this issue.    Mr Molefe, yes.     In 2018 it was Mr Molefe.      During that time, Chair, we had a lot of discussions.     Minister Dipuo Peters.     So I said    It is our Group Legal under ...[intervenes]      Dingiswayo.     So what I am trying to say is Chair is thatthey have identified ...[intervenes]      ...a number of contracts or entities.     Now, this company is not known to meChair.  It is providing a service.  Employees when they go and [speaking vernacular]  They do not come to the Group CEO and say we are going to go to that company.  I do not know this company.  But here are people who then give themselves.  They are very in-checked with business which is Group ...[indistinct].  We are performing a payroll function as – on behalf of that company affected.  What is the benefit, okay?  Now part of why these companies play an important role, Chair.  If the employees as highly indebted,it is a merger(?) assist you on how to manage your business and your employees.  It also – when you deal with increases in salaries and everything and the way you structured the whole package to employees because it – making sure that the employees are not highly indebted.  A train driver who is highly indebted, when he gets – going to one accident scene and the train driver who clearly was involved in an accident will find that yet he is – what is called – this salary payslip there, okay?  You can see this driver was introuble.  So the point I am making ...[intervenes]      Exactly, Chair.     So I can go through a number of things Chair, that all the entities that they are irregular are entities – when I went on leave they started to identify and they felt that they have got the authority, Chair, to say – and I will be ashamed, Chair, if I was Mr Dingiswayo, I will not say that and said until this are addressed I would not be drafting the agreement.  This is a very arrogant statement by someone who does not have the authority.  And when I dismissedMr Dingiswayo, I said to him when I called him into the office.  I realised that when I asked this company’s complains or they bring issues to my attention and I asked business, they said Legal has stopped.  So you are part.  And I used those words in an email – and I hope this email is here Chair.  I did not mix(?) my words because I realised that this was part of a concerted effort to undermine the business and undermine my leadership in the business.  And I would not accept that Chair.  This 14.3, Chair, I thought that Dingiswayo would hide it and notbe as blatant of where I stand, Chair.  Now I think it is that.     No, Chair.     Not – Chair, not being a ...[indistinct] not – I do not think Mr Dingiswayo was on suspension at that time, Chair.       No, I was not aware Chair but I think if that was the approach that was the correct approach.     The one in 14.5?     Yes.  No, no Chair, I read that.  I do not know who was the general – and Chair that is where the problem comes.     And the paragraph, when it goes down, it says but Mr Montana contended that there was nothing wrong with the extension of...  So there is a generalagreement and so the general is the Chair.  And the CEO has got a different view.Even that paragraph is problematic.  Even all of these things, Chair, because there are people in meetings – you know these things are not dealt with by 18 000 employees.  There are very specific people involved in this.  Okay?  Ms Ngoye would be one person.  The guy on training is – I cannot recall his name.  Mr Allen.  There is the Group Executive HR.  There are the Procurement people.  Before it even comes as recommended to.  Nowthis general view, Chair, who does it represents?  And so I – what must I do as CEO?  Because there is a general view, I must agree to it?  You know...  So, Chair, you can see that it is not specific.  It is making us actually to search for things that – I do notthink he is right, Chair.  Unless if he tells us that who specifically said it is invalid.  And that is the point I was making earlier on, that you have employees who decide that it is invalid.  It is invalid.  And you see, Chair, I am interested in the annexure the end of that – because I think – I am hoping there is the email that I wrote to these chaps that I mastered into playing games with the business.         No, I did not share the view, Chair.     Chair, I do not know where that view – where this discretion ...[intervenes]      187?     I have got that, Chair.     Indeed, Chair.     Chair, that is my email Chair.  It confirms what I have just said earlier on.     But that is my email, Chair.       Ja.     I am complaining ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]  ADV VAS SONI     Indeed, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Indeed, Chair.     Indeed.     That is me, Chair.  That is me speaking here.     ...trust my state of mind at that time.    The one that I reported about that were mandated(?) to the chair.  I realised that he told me about a number of things ...[intervenes]      ...in Cape Town.     That a number of things, Mashonisa.      So it is not only Prodigy.  It is not...  There is a whole range of the - Chair, that they – when I went on leave, studies these things that popped up and are looked at, Chair.  And you will see my conclusion in that email Chair to say what I regard as the basis for these activities.     Thank you, Chair.     Well, the main driver, of course, was the chairman of the board.       Mr Molefe.       And that is why I said that I corrected some of these things when I was in Cape Town and they became part of the major propaganda of this information being fed to the newspapers, some of the journalists were writing all these stories.  There was a big offensive, Chair, the issue that I had is that all these employees did not have the authority.The authority resided with the executives, resides with the Group CEO and in someinstances with the board as to what we declare as irregular or not irregular and, Chair, in my affidavit I …[intervenes]     The Chair, it was Ms Ngoyi herself.     It was Mr Dingiswayo.     And I think Mr Sydney Khuzwayo was there, was party to the campaign.     Ja.     Chair, the person who raised all these issues, by the way, on Prodigy, I cannot recall Allan’s surname but he was in our HR group in the department, Chair, and these were ones who wanted us to appoint some other people.  So they had their own preferred people, Chair, and if it did not go their way, they started this campaign.  They started feeding the board but more specifically Mr Molefe with this sort of information and they ran with this stuff and I was prepared to, Chair, to bring an end to that.    Alan.  I will remember the name as we continue, Chair.     Allan Ghanghia.     Ganghia     He was part of particularly – morespecifically on issues related to Prodigy, Chair.     Chair, you will see in my affidavit, I actually detailed some of the files because all of these people were lobbying me to get the support.       So I am aware of their battles.     And when it comes to the Commission after either losing battle inside or they put themselves asholier than thou and that is not true, Chair.     Ja.     Okay.  And I know that, Chair, except to say one thing, Chair, that – you see, when you use information selectively, you will see again, Chair, in my affidavit and my annexures, where Mr Dingiswayo says theGroup CEO, when he approved the Prodigy partnership was misled, he says that in 2015.  This thing happened in 2010.  So five years he was not there, Chair, he cannot say he was misled.Now when you look at what he is saying and what he said in his email in 2015, it will be part of my annexure, there is just no correlation, Chair.  Okay?  And you can see he is very vocal.  What he is trying to drive at here, he is trying to get that there is a relationship between Prodigy, Montana and one Roy Moodley.  If you analyse the affidavit, and that is why I am dealing with it in detail in my affidavit, because it has got nothing to do with facts, it has to do with pursuing an agenda and that was the basis for targeting contracts. Strawberry is targeted, Chair.  Who signed the contract with Strawberry?  Not Lucky Montana, it is signed by Martha Ngoyi.   She comes to the Commission and say Montana promoted Strawberry.  Because why?  It is linked – because they say it is linked to Moodley.  So it is narrative,Chair, that we must break with solid facts and that is what I am going to do throughout my testimony.     No, no, Chair.     No, the answer is no, Chair.     The nature of the partnership and the offer that we received, Chair, is not one that requires a – what is it called, a tender process or procurement processin that way but what will happen, Chair, though is that even in instances like those and that is why Mr Dingiswayo speaks of the Chief Procurement Officer because even if something does not go out on tender, it still has to serve through the structures and the committees when it isrecommended to me.  That is very important, Chair. But the nature of the programme, Chair, it is like somebody say did you go out on tender for the 2010 FIFA World Cup?  No, it is a FIFA event, it is not our event, we partner with them, Chair, it is not – we cannot go out on tender for that.  So there was none here, so the answer is no, Chair.     Indeed, Chair.    That is correct.     Correct, Chair.     Well, Chair, I saw that – I saw that there was a – you remember unsolicited offers so be it are dealt with through a treasury rule.  I think treasury regulation.  At that time it did not apply to this one, specifically, Chair.  But there are instances where treasury rules, for example on unsolicited bids, would come into effect and what will happen, Chair, is that the Group Chief Procurement Officer of PRASA will then advise and say if you going on an unsolicited route the rules apply and this is how we should go about doing it.    No, I cannot say anything here, Chair, because I may have then to read the treasury regulations.  If it was elevated at that time it was not elevated to me whether by the legal department that drafted the contractat that time or by our Group HR but the nature of the programme, I do not think, Chair, that it required that, no.     No, fair point, Chair, I think that when the matter came I referred it to two people, Tiro Holele and Mr Mpepa Ramoodwa(?).  I did not specifically identify legal and that may have been that oversight, Chair, but when the contract was put together, it was the legal department that did all the work, Chair.     They put together the partnership agreement, Chair.     That is the one, yes.     Chair, can I add one small thing?       We must also ask who is the authority in terms of the SCM policy when, for example, there are anydeviations and everything because the policy will clarify who is responsible for that because that is also very important about where does it take his concerns to.But my point, a general one, Chair, it is very clear that this was no happening in isolation it was a number of a number of contracts that had been identified that were presented as being “irregular” and I would not accept that as CEO, Chair.    What page is that again?    103?    Okay.    That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     I do not know that part but we met that evening Chair.     That is correct Chair.     No, no I told him directly Chair.     No Chair, I mentioned numerous tenders but they were not tenders, the contracts that were enforced that will be either stopped or terminated because of hisown actions Chair.     When I went on leave Chair, in December 14.     No Chair, I did not speak about a specific tender.  You recall earlier on I mentioned a series of a number of these tenders that were, or not tenders, but contracts.  Existing contracts that were either being stopped or investigated and that is what I discussed with him.    No, no Chair.  These are existing, these were existing contracts.    Not new tenders ...[intervenes]    Ja Chair, I told him about the number of, I mentioned the number of contracts.      Existing contracts.     Exactly Chair, the issue about and that is the point we were discussing before lunch.    The issue about there is a general feeling.   Who is the general.   Precisely, because that was the issue Chair.    And I said he firstly did not have the authority to do so.    But also you were applying it in a very selective way.    You see Chair, let me provide one factual issue here.     What had happened at that time, and this other than the, what I mentioned about the Cape Town meeting with the Chair.  Subsequent to that there was an email which I do not have but I think some of the information presented here is very selective Chair.     Mr Lindikaya who was the companysecretary at that time, then sent a list of contracts, of existing contracts to Mr Joseph Hongulo, who was the chief procurement officer at the time and these were contracts that they wanted to investigate. That list of course that email came to mypossession and was consistent with what we discussed with the Chair in Cape Town.  So that is when I decided that I will act.  So this thing about some contracts being invalid or void, is not an isolated thing. It was part of a thing that certain contracts, not contract and Chair I give by the way in my affidavit examples of for example contracts almost similar to Prodigy, but they will not even be investigated or looked at.  So they selected because what they were looking for, again I deal with it in my affidavit. They thought that there are some powerful forces relating behind these tenders and they found that that is not true.  It is ordinary people who were doing work, and they just went on to destroy their lives.     Yes Chair, they either ... the biggest thing that was happening Chair, they would then block payments ...[intervenes]    And say it is under investigation.    And all of those things, indeed Chair.     And Chair, it is consistent with the letter, with rather the email that the counsel read earlier on.    Their own email to all the three people to say ...[intervenes]     About the campaign that was happening Chair.    And this is what destroyed PRASA.    No, no I do not have Chair, but at that time I did have.  I could no longer access, after I had left I could no longer access my email Chair.     Chair, I think Prodigy was one of them, ja.     No, no it was.     No, Swifambo ... Swifambo was on that list chair.     Siyangena was on that list.  Mashonisa was also on that list.    Well, the name Chair is still running away from me.   But in the course of our investigation, I put it on record Chair.     Chair, there was one dealing with the introduction of a security system on the central line in the Cape.  I think that was done by one Israeli company, which was putting new technology to protect the network there.  So we did a test on that. I think there was the issue of a company called Sofinity if I remember well.  There was quite a couple of companies Chair that were on the list of that email, where these companies, they needed information to look at.     Royal Chair, was not there.  Royal was not there.     Strawberry Works was there Chair.     Chair, I have already formed the view at that time, a firm view that here is a Chair who is not working with the interest of the company, who is pursuing aparticular agenda, and for example finance will say we are not ... when a company writes to me and say we are not being paid or there is this problem, then finance will say but this contract has been flagged by legal for investigation. I said but what is this investigation.Who authorised such an investigation?  So Chair, so that view I formed and when I called him to say I think your time is up here, that was the matter.  The other issue was the fact about when he says I will not draft the agreement, there was the issue about his ex-boss who had left and refused to represent the interest of the company. All of those combined had given me a clear view that you are working with other people to undermine PRASA.  To create this thing of this massive, what is itcalled?  The grant corruption in this company.  When there is none, and Chair that is why I said earlier on that his right to identify shortcomings, witnesses or even irregularity, Chair it is proper.That when you do that and you select, you target the company that is owned by Zondo and you jump the one that is owned by Montana with the same thing, the same company.  Chair, in my ... for example in my submission on this specific issue, I list the companies that were in the same position as Prodigy.Mr Dingiswayo jumped that, and even Fast Forward, at the time when I had left, between that time I had left and his testimony to this commission, there were a lot of companies Chair, that Mr Dingiswayo did not even raise a hand and say Werksmans was appointed irregularly.Why?  Because it ... Chair, it is the same WhatsApp group.  They are tied Chair.  Those are the words he used.  Let me give you another one.  There is a company called Forefront, okay which Mr Molefe and his board handpicked for the work that they needed to do in terms of media and all of those things.  These were raised not by me, they were raised even by National Treasury as it were.  Mr Dingiswayo, between the time I left, if indeed he was this champion to fight against irregularity, or any form of corruption, why then didhe jump those. Why do you select, and that is the point that I am making and I realised that he is not working for this company.  He is working for certain people in the company, and I said to him that look, the usual route is a disciplinary route. But for someone like you, you and Mata in fact you have made it very clear, you have ... what is the word?  You have confirmed where you stand on these issues and I said you cannot work for me.  You cannot do that.  How doI sit with that?Remember Chair, even though Fanie reported to Martha, the appointment and dismissal of GM’s was the CEO’s responsibility.  So I took that decision.  In that meeting I decided to fire him and after I have explained tohim I said you are not going to explain anything.  You, I think you are not working in the best interest of the company and I formed a firm view around that.     Indeed Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.     Chair, let me add there.  I think you have summarised it correctly.    I need to say Chair, that one of the thingsis that he has not given me the opportunity as the person who should make the decision on this matter.  I have never received a single memo or message from Mr Dingiswayo ...[intervenes]     Saying that, that is why my email that I sent, before I fired [indistinct] there was an email ...[intervenes]     There was the conversations that weretaking place, and I did tell the Chair of the board Mr Molefe, these people that are briefing you and providing with information, they are going to mislead you and today we are paying the price Chair with PRASA that has collapsed.    Indeed Chair.     No, I have made up my mind Chair.  I made up my mind, that is correct.     That is correct Chair.     Indeed Chair.     Chair, I had taken a decision that ...[intervenes]     Fanie should go.    And yes, the normal process if it was a border line issue ...[intervenes]     Or factor to be established, but I was convinced that here is a group of people working inside thecompany, who were actually not even prepared to even follow the direction that we have agreed upon, because what PRASA was implementing, were not Montana’s decisions. They were decisions that were made by our executive committee and they were decisions made by EXCO.     No Chair, if you read that email you can see that, you remember Mr Soni I ... when you read that email I emphasised that it gives exactly my state of mind.     My state of mind ja.    It captured, I cannot deny that Chair.     Yes.     No Chair, I have made up my mind.  I think that you can see that one of the sentences that I put there ...[intervenes]     It is very clear.  My mind was very clear ...[intervenes]     That there are certain people that it is either I go or they go.  But we are no longer going to findany common ground, and that was the case Chair.      I have made up my mind Chair.     Chair, the disciplinary code and I think that together with the, with parts of the Labour RelationsAct ...[intervenes]     I think that it is generally the principle that he must subject to someone give him a hearing, subject him to the disciplinary hearing.  That is overall principle, but I do not think it exclude in some instances the issue of summarily dismissing someone when you think a lot is at stake. I think that when you drive a wedge between board and management, it is a serious issue Chair and it issomething that in my view, and it is a choice that you make as a CEO because ultimately we are CEO’s because we have to evaluate all the evidence and make a decision. My decision was that the relationship between, and we saw how you asked the question, I think it was youcounsel who asked the question.  The, why the relationship between myself and Mr Molefe even deteriorated Chair, other than the process of his appointment. There was a lot of these things happening.  When Mr Molefe asked me those issues about, raised those issues in Cape Town, it was quite clear Chair that there was a lot at play.  That I go on leave, people feed the Chairman with all of those things. He did not get them from me.  He got them from someone else.  Someone else, and I knew Chair when Icame out of that, that I am going to deal with it firmly and decisively.     Yes.     Chair, look I think ... Chair, look we had processes at that time.  I think that in most instances it is assumed that when we say we give you a chance we mean a disciplinary case.  A consultation is part of that process Chair, and I think that that is what would have happened. Secondly Chair, these matters are not about me. Maybe we are relating it to you, but they are about PRASA.  That is about, if you come in and blow up the implementation of contracts, it is about PRASA, it is not about me. I may be the CEO and the board asked me about the performance.  I have got to act against that.  So we did of course Chair deal with that issue.  There was a meeting between myself and the Chair, because a day after the same thing happened with Martha Ngoye.  I think we will deal with it at a later stage.    But the same process, because Martha then came to fight about the issue and I said here is the issue and you are part of it, and  but at the next board meeting, I think they went and raised it with the Chairmanof the board. We had a board meeting.  I think that the board meeting was delayed for about two to three hours, because myself and Mr Molefe were fighting over these matters, and in the interest of progress we then agreed that no, let them be reinstated. I then said to him it is fine, I am going to reinstate them but I am going to charge them in that case, which is what happened.  So I called them back, I withdrew their dismissal and then I immediately gave them the letter,suspending them pending a disciplinary case. So we had discussions about that, but these matters were not personal matters as far as I was concerned.They were about PRASA.Someone sabotaging PRASA’s decisions and programs.      I have already made up my mind Chair.    Martha Ngoye.    The 18 t h is the day I wrote my email.    Yes, no I had already formed that opinion Chair, that they have to go.     Yes, and many others Chair, and many others.     Many others Chair, so yes.     Well, I cannot remember that Chair, but it is possible that I have, because I wanted to be fair as well,but I made it very clear.  We cannot work together.     No Chair, he signed ... it sounds like someone I know.  They represent themselves as brave.  No, that was ... he was unhappy Chair.     He was unhappy.    He looked unhappy, but those words were not uttered as far as I remember Chair, no.     I think, Chair if I recall well, I am not sure if his letter of dismissal was ready.  I assumed that he - because the letter would have been drafted by the legal department, not by me and then - so the actual meeting took place he got a letter, but I cannot recall exactly nowChair that was in that very evening, or it was the it was the next day, Chair.     No, no I will not take issue with that,Chair no.      Yes I think it was the legal department or the HR, our Group HR.      On my instruction Chair.    Yes Chair, but the drafting of the letter, I think, yes I think it should have been the legal department, if I am wrong then it would have been our ...[intervenes]      Our HR team that ...[indistinct].    But I invited them.   And I think I did explain the reasons, and say craft it for me, and then I signed the letter there.     Chair I decided on these issues.     No Chair I think it would have been after my meeting with him.    Because I think - I cannot recall. But something I think happened Chair and that is why I called him to say, because I asked for him, he was not in the office.     I was told he left.  I said no I want him to call me. And that's what we do of course with senior managers, sometimes you call them and I learned from the best Chair, when he said Mr Ollerman must come back even if he is gone.    Chair the - I think, if I recall well, because I used to have what also what to call a one on one meeting, and more specifically with the HR executive. I did mention because the situation in the business was deteriorating, there was a lot of tension. There was a lot of in-fighting, even our own executive meetings were split in between in the middle. And so - so I think, and I knew what would be the advisor to come to, and I think he summarised it so well, that suspend these guys, go through a process, but I believe the job of a CEO is to evaluate, isit in the best interest of the company with the disciplinary case versus a further point of mobilisation for all these forces that were there?  And Chair you know when I met with the Chair of the Board we would discuss this matter two hours before,and we had two three hours delay in the board meeting. I kept on asking the Chair, I shared the principle that we're making, but have you become a shop steward for some of these people in the business, so - so if you if you, if you look, if you look into where PRASA was Chair, I think that it was not normal, it was not the normal environment. And, and that it's unfortunate if you asked me if it was a different environment, but I have sat with executives Chair where I have asked some of them to leave and the way I do it, I sit with them and say, look, we are going this way, andI think you're going that way. I'll give you an example with one of the ICT executives, I would sit with her all the time and say look we have employed as an executive, not as an ICT specialist. So we have put you in a leadership position. And you are not operating at that level, you keep on dropping. And so you can coach you can consult with people say, I want you to operate at that level for us, for us to achieve our goals. These are not junior employees Chair, these are people that are highly paid, and they should operate at that particular level. And we need to bevery careful that whilst the principle is important. I think the principle outlined in the law is - must be respected at all the times, but I think there is instances where when people don't – you know if Mr Dingiswayo’s meeting states or was taking decisions that I do not like, his agenda, Iwould understand.  I am saying he was actively part of the process to undermine the company Chair, and why should he get the benefit of a good policy of PRASA about his disciplinary process?  I don't believe in that. I believe that you must you must wake up these particular issues.  So I respect Chair what Mr Soni is saying, I don't dispute with that, but I think I am trying to convey as honestly as possible that I've taken a decision that these guys must - is there all the way. And maybe even the kind of thing that was happening with the chairman of the boardwould even perhaps even change.      That is a correct summation Chair, I agree with that.    I don't think it took five minutes. But Ithink the value of it was in our discussion, not on the - more than the – if I were to take the 30 minutes into account Chair it means I have to build a compound inside PRASA for these executives to sleep there, so that I know when I want to consult with them, they're immediately available.      That's more or less the principle. I think there's Mr Dingiswayo is correct, it didn’t take long.     Well 10/15 minutes Chair I think ja, more or less ja.    Chair I think he - I don't think there was something that - I think I had taken the decision that day.     That was his last day that I was going to execute that task that very day, and I think I was probably in many meetings.     And by the time I was looking for him, he had left for home and that is why I called Chair.     That’s correct Chair.    Well Chair no, I think the let us be guidedby evidence. Mr Dingiswayo wrote and said people were – people at the - and I said ...[intervenes]     No, not the general acceptance, but in another one way he said when the CEO approved this thing some people misled the CEO, and so you can see Chair that there's a lot of tense and twists in all of these things.    The Prodigy matter Chair.   Where he said, when he wrote in an email now, if we take it to its logical conclusion, and talk about Investec, so it meant therefore that some of the paragraphs that he - that we dealt with, they now get adifferent meaning. We'll have to go back and you'll see it will actually mean that here's a man who is accusing his - the good CEO of something untoward. Okay, and it is dealt with so.  So Mr. Soni if we take it to its logical conclusion, we have – I assume that the Commission will be will be driven by evidence, will check for example, why Prodigy, why not 600 Companies and they're in my affidavit Chair, there are many other companies that were left, and why he's been silent on many others, and I am saying there'sonly one explanation is because it has to do with the list of companies that they've identified, not through structures of the company, not through the board of each member, but on the on the site and then try to try to give him, try to implement.  Chair I think my responding affidavit to point 3 on Mr Dingiswayo actually, I am putting it actually in a very – in a light-hearted way.  Actually I am putting it very strongly in the written word Chair, So yes, if the Commission evaluate, and I presented evidence to the Commission, and it takes that, of course Chair it meansthat I've got the right to go to court and say but I've given the Commission this evidence, and on what basis did the Chair of the Commission ignore this evidence, and exercise my right in that respect, and the same apply Chair to what, on Friday we discussed in respect to the contracts, youremember saying that you've got judgments where, for example there's scathing statements about me by the courts, but I was also denied the right to - to put my view. So - so that if the Commission - the Commission will have to take that into account, it is the same principle.  But I, I respect that I don't think for the record Chair I was invested in any of these companies, and in fact, despite the fact that I was one of the most investigated people Chair ...[intervenes]     Investigated in essence.    And you'll see Chair this will become clear when we discuss particularly the - the Ollermans report that – that – that - that was here, and they still cannot find Chair, whether law enforcement agencies or whether investigations appointed the PRASA, they are struggling to find – I can point all day it was an irregularity, there Mr Montana made a mistake, but they cannot accuse me of any form of improper conduct or corruption Chair, it cannotbe.    The one that I wrote on?   Yes.   Yes.    No, not at all.   So I don't know about the relationship between former President Zuma and Mr. Moodley. You know, again, I deal with it in my affidavit, this specific issue of Royal Security.  Royal was not appointed by us, byus I mean, when I became CEO and the board, ...[indistinct].  In fact there was an investigation done by I think it was Deloittes, to look at the security companies that were involved in with PRASA, and it found that the majority of those companies were in fact appointed in the 1990s before that was even passed. So and more specifically Royal Security. It was involved in railways in 1991.  Now Chair, and how does it come to PRASA?   It is because when Metrorail Shosholoza Mail were transferredin terms of Section 197 we had to take all the employees and we had to take all their contracts, all the Metrorail contractors, that is how – so we did not appoint Royal Security. It has already been there. And then who recommended for these security companies to beextended? Our friend ...[indistinct] and people like ...[indistinct] in the PETA adjudication committee. Now because there's a fight Chair, because there's a fight between myself and the Chairman of the board, they are on the other side. What do they do?  Then they tell the Chair this is Montana's corruption.  They don't tell the Chair that we recommended this at this particular stage. So I think there is no leg - even when I consulted the legal and the investigating teams of the Commission, one of the things they mentioned was that Mr Ollermansaid, among the issues that you're going to touch Mr Montana is about is what we call the security syndicate that runs PRASA. Chair PRASA doesn't even have that. It's got so many security companies that are up and mainly regionalised. They're not actually operating at a national level, they are more regionalized, appointed at that level, and they attempt to elevate Royal and say that Royal – Royal was then getting paid by PRASA, and then to sustain or to support the former President Zuma is just so false, and so I found that it is not based on fact.    No, no Chair I do not accept, I do not accept that. That is why I say that Prodigy, and that is why in my response to my email, I said Prodigy is properly appointed, it is within our rights to enter those partnerships. We may not have gone out on tender like we don't do.  You know Chair confinement is an integral part of the policy of PRASA where for specific reasons will they say we are confining business to that particular – to that particular entity or it is the only one that has got either theknow how or need or some other reason so. So Prodigy was not improperly a appointed Chair. What has happened is that after as an afterthought I think people tried to find reasons where because Prodigy was part of a company that people believed belong to a network of Roy Moodley.     Not with me.    If we if we go that route, then I have another problem with - we are basically saying the criticism of this Commission that is targeting certain people that Zuma has been targeted. You see Chair in one of my submissions I deal with the ANC battles, particular from the security companies, okay. I mentioned the company ofMr Spoyanda, okay GNS Security. I think that it was also mentioned here in Transnet, even at PRASA. But you will not hear Chair a lot of these things because people look at who stands where in the divide. But I don't think the Commission should approach this issue, if there are irregularities in the appointment of Royal let the Commission deal with those facts.  If there is irregularity the appointment of Prodigy let's deal with that. They didn't I mean, is the link – I was trying to be linked even President Zuma, you read too many articles of the stuff ofthe investigation done by for example Werksmans. They tried to link some of us to President Zuma.  They say no even Mr Molefe when he was sitting here he actually said in his evidence part of State Capture is that people are appointed to serve particular interests.And you know what was my post on the Twitter Chair, I said well I was appointed by - under the cabinet of President Mbeke, I was appointed in 2007 as a CEO of the South African Rail Commuter Corporation, and I ...[indistinct] President Mbeki.  So, so I hear what Mr Soni - but I think it would be – we will be treading on some dangerous ground that actually may invite a lot of criticism to this Commission. And I don't think that's where we want to go Chair.    Chair let – thanks very much for that I think there is also assuring words I think to many people out there.  As you know the commission is being debated politically in many platforms in many circles and all of those things.  Chair the – let me explain why I put it that way.You know when you look and I think at some stage when we deal with the Werksmans investigations and reports you look at all of the – of what had transpired.  When the time comes you will actually see that there has been this attempt to link former President with us.  Youknow and for some reason I do not know why I cannot run away from President Zuma.In 2007 my first year as a CEO of PRASA I had to write a letter explaining myself to the then Minister of Transport.  There was an accusation Chair that I am usingPRASA to support a faction in the ANC – the Zuma faction against the Mbeki faction.  Chair I was so angry I wrote angry letters and the Minister had to counsel me and say calm down.  We are in the middle of a political storm and do not get inside it let it pass.But Chair can I assure you of one thing.  I have checked all our major contracts.  All the Werksmans reports have been leaked to particular journalists Chair and you will see what they have written and what the report said.  Insome instances using the same words.Because they have been trying to link Zuma to Swifambo, Zuma to Siyangena, Zuma to Rail Security.  When you look specifically at PRASA Chair you know the only time we – anything that brought us closer even to the Gupta’s would have been the SABC program in the morning.  But other than that Chair we have never had that and that is why I said on Friday you will never find Zuma or the Gupta’s lurking behind any of the programs that we have implemented.So I want to be hanged Chair for my seat I do not want to be hanged because I am linked to…    People think I am linked to Zuma for some reason and that is why in 2007 as the CEO I had to produceall the tenders that we have managed to prove that we have never funded a youth league or anyone else to propel President Zuma to office.So Chair we have been subjected to all of those things.    But I think moving forward we have to overcome that and also continue to forge.    Unity amongst South Africans so that someof these divisions we overcome them Chair.    So Chair I would not – I would not have the total amount.  I do not know.  I do not know Chair as I sithere.    Ja.    Chair I would not – I would not know.  One of the things for example that I am raising in my affidavit was that there was a time when Mr Allan Genge who was responsible for that in fact did not claim some of that moneyand actually I was chastising – I was responding to Mr Dingiswayo that if this one issue that is one issue where somebody neglected his duties and did not do the work.  So if you change this issue – change all of them together.So – so I do not know how much was – we got from both SETA’s Chair.  I would not have checked that but I think the annual report of PRASA of that time I could go and verify and check the numbers because they will give us a senses to how much was paid from the skills levy and – but we did include Prodigy Chair into our – into PRASA’s skills plan thatwe submitted and once you submit a report then that is when you get paid.  So – so ja but I will check Chair.  I will check I am not sure how much was recovered by PRASA.    Prodigy was not the only company providing training services to PRASA but there are areas where Prodigy was the only accredited on some of the programs Chair and I deal with that in my affidavit.  And there are instances where PRASA used Prodigy’s work to apply for funding from SETA and allocate that money to other people.  I also provide that in detail Chair.So this matter is more complex than – we may befighting Chair battles of managers at PRASA about whose better could we find better because that is my share of influence but I am actually dealing with the real issue.  I highlight that in the centre.  So it was not the only one but there are areas and there are certain competencies where other service providers were not accredited or vice versa as well Chair.    Chair let me deal you quoted Section 217 which of the constitution and Chair I just want to drawbecause I think …    No, no I do not …    No, no I do not need a copy Chair.    I know – I know thanks very much Chair.  I know it very well.      And I will tell you why I know it very well because I was part of the Department of Public Works at the time when the constitution was drafted and we had a direct input into that process Chair.  So unfortunate Section 217 the way it is being interpreted Chair has become an instrument to undermine transformation in the country.I deal with that at length as well when it is used in broad brush in derailed it is used in that way Chair incorrectly.  Okay.  So I think this reference to 217 as a country we needto be very careful because at the time when it was drafted Chair that is actually an on-going battle in the country particularly between within our National Treasury at that time Department of State Expenditure, Department of Public Works we have started implementing certain measures Chairwhich later of course had to be incorporated.  The PPPFA Chair was to give effect to some of the things that we are talking about.It also became an instrument to undermine all of those things. This particular matter Chair and many others that are mentioned in the Public Protector report in no way undermine Section 217.  And I deal with that for example when you look at the – at the Siyangena matter.  I deal with that when I look at the Public Protector matter and I think Chair the – it is being used in a way that does not assist –that does not assist us.  Both the constitution, the PPPFA as a law, the PFMA they recognise that entities will also have policies and these policies we give effect in one way or the other to what the constitution had intended to achieve.   Chair no, no.  I – at that time 217 is raised now it is a question Chair.   I never dealt with it in respect of Prodigy.    But I have raised it – I have dealt with 217    In relation to other matters.    Specifically the Public Protector report.    The point I made though at the beginning Chair.    Was that did we have to go out on tender?    To an offer that we received and I say no.   And I still maintain that position Chair.    And it is not in violation of 217 Chair from where I sit Chair.    No not all of them Chair.    Let us say you have an – I think at that time we were discussing an unsolicited bid.    If you have an unsolicited bid the company – your company is going to run that project, pay for it and all of those things.  You may then have to look at what Treasury rules.    Regulations says in that particular respect.    So I am not saying in general.    And that is why Chair earlier on.   We dealt with the issue of the 2010.    And I think my point was misunderstood.    I was not dealing with the award I am saying once Fifa for example comes into the country.    When they contract with PRASA for train services and all of those things there is no tender processChair.    There cannot be a tender process.    Fifa owns the world cup.   It is their own event Chair.    So you cannot go out on tender.    The second report of the Public Protector Volume 2 of derail drafted by Advocate Mkwebane it dismissed all the matters but found on one Chair that and it says it – the complaint is sustained.  It is saying PRASA and Transnet when PRASA got Njangi Haus which is an oldrailway building PRASA should have gone out on tender. Now Chair the law says you go out on – where it is not practical to do so we cannot – we want – we want Njangi Haus it is part of the railway station we want to run our operations there.  Now two state owned – state owned company cannot go to another and say let us transfer that building.  We are told it does not actually create value Chair. So I am simply saying there are instances where either a partnership – for example we had a partnership withFIfa. We could not go out on tender Chair.  But of course it – was it transparent?  Yes it was transparent.  Was the pricing a competitive one?  Price yes was a competitive one.  So – so I am simply saying Chair not that everything we do we are reducing everything to tenders and that is whythere is all these big fights about tenders.  But on this one Chair I do not hold a view that it was in violation of the PFMA or Treasury Regulations and most importantly Section 217 of the Constitution.    We – yes.  Mr Montana whatever it is you accept that their competitors to Prodigy who were pro – who could provide those services.  Very same services and I know you say but there were some only Prodigy could provide but there were other services which – other services could provide.  You have already said that is true.    No Chair let us not go into the world of speculation.  Let us be very specific on this.    No, no Chair I am not going to change.  I am not changing.  I am not changing it.   No, no Chair.    Prodigy is appointed or is given an award by a SETA and they decide with PRASA.  Now – now Section 217 I want to link it.  It requires us to put in place a – when we buy goods and services a system that is fair, transparent,competitive, all that.    And Chair the policy of PRASA it defines that system.  Unless it is something – including of course where we do not go through competitive tender processes.    It is part of – it is part of those systems – is part of that system.    Therefore Chair unless if you say Mr Soniwould say to me you as a Group CEO you did not put in place okay?  A system of – a system of that is fair, competitive, that meets Section 217 and that I would challenge there Chair.But – but a confinement on exception Chair does notmean that that system is not in place.  And so we – we are taking one contract to define the system.    And that is where my challenge is Chair.    Yes.    No Chair I hear you clearly.    And I think in principle yes I agree with you.   When we – when we take a decision Chair.    That we are going to go that route.    And that must apply unless it has exception.    Of course there are also where it is not practical.    To do that for apparent reasons.    Chair if you look at – we go back to…    Soni    Chair I think – I think that the – for me the starting point because even that was not – I need to reflect to the commission what was the thinking at that time.    And we debate.    And that is why we call this a partnership.  Because I say here are two organisations of course the starting point is whether Prodigy was properly appointed by– because that is where the capacity or the skills – that is what different organisations for service providers and training compete to provide for that.   The money comes from this particular entity – this – what is called the services it is the one that says we appoint you, you are going to do this for us than they go and partner with whoever they do – they deem to table for that. Now – now Chair that is why I was putting that in the realm of – of all other sorts of partnerships that we have.  And with what you are raising it actually raises a questionthat even some of the partnerships that we have or would define or that we had at the time I was there would we define them as goods and services in that sense and it may require a re-thinking Chair but where we stood at that time this was a partnership we did not require that kind of a root and I think of four or five other partnerships that we had entered into at that time that even though there was money there was some kind of service that was – was being used but I am not sure Chair that it takes you to a point where PRASA had identified a need.  There is people – remember Chair part of the issues that we – we operate also in a commercial environment.  People come with ideas, people come with proposals.  And I think it is because – because of that that is sure Treasury trying to now regulate that in the form of unsolicited bids andputting regulations to manage that.   My view Chair is that when I look at this I do not think that it falls into that and I think that maybe the fine line that we have been drawn between the partnership or – I mean look at how people for example abuse the issue of what – emergency procurement.  Is there and everyone will try to find a reason for it to be an emergency when in fact it is not an emergency.    Indeed Chair.   You know that in the PRASA environment when we deal with the issue of Siyangena we deal with the 10 World Cup emergency in January 2010.  So yes Chair I think that my view is that the commission will have to evaluate this in totality and say what was the thinking but from where I sit I think that there is a space the Public Protector ruled on one matter involving PRASA where there was a partnership and said that it should have gone out on tender.  I am not sure if I agree Chair but I think we just have to evaluate the entire evidence and make a – and maybe that would be one the recommendations where the commission say you want to amend that part?  Make it clear, structure it in that way so that there are no – there are no – you know –grounds where people can either manipulate or there is no    Chair you can – may repeat that.    Yes.    Indeed Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Chair if you recall earlier on I was talking about the – some partnerships depending on the conditions under which they happen.   For example here the deciding factor.    Is Prodigy is not coming to PRASA and saying we want to do training.   It is saying we are being awarded this thing.    We want to – you to work with PRASA.    Of course I think the issue that maybe Section 217 or the competitive fair process will come when we then move beyond a 300.  For example I say…    That it arise.   I think Chair there is a big question I never thought about it at that time.    With hindsight I think that that question may arise.    Is this is a – when PRASA bought Njangi Haus from Transnet PRASA made a conscious decision at that we are buying this building from Transnet because theprocess of a Section 54 of the PFMA they take long to transfer that business through getting government approval and all of those things.   And we knew that we are buying that building not from any other – we were not looking for any other building we wantedNjangi Haus located where the main rail operations are which is historically a railway building.  So we are not buying any other building.  So Chair that decides we did Brexit development.     The land belonged to the City of Durban plus – and it had, in fact, taken that land, entered into a partnership.     Now when we wanted to build our stationunder the ...[indistinct] we could not go out and tender.  It was not practical.  We could not do that.  But we need a phase linking Brick City to the entire railway line.  We could afford to go out on tender because that was practical.  That was possible.  So you make decisions on that basis.  So here, Prodigy says I have got this thing.  I am offering it to PRASA.  Once you accept it, Chair, it is not any other.  And it means, of course, that the Seta had its own process on why they gave that to Prodigy and not to someone elsebut if PRASA decided to go we are going to train 5 000 people, PRASA decide and this is going to be our requirement.  It is obliged to follow ...[intervenes]       ...to go out and tender and that would bethe case.     So this are not the same.     And that is the kind of explanation I am trying to provide.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Indeed, Chair.    Because I think I said they were bringing in not only the award ...[intervenes]      ...but we also have to go and check.     At that authority when we gave Prodigy this thing, Chair ...[intervenes]      ...I think ...[intervenes]     ...there are certain competencies, there are certain things, Chair, how the companies were given to do one of those things.     ...we were then able to come to a determination.    To answer ...[intervenes]      ...the question that Mr Soni is raising.     But as I see it right now, Chair.     You ask me do I think and I think there is somewhere I wrote – I think there is an email where I said that – but how do you want the partnership?  Because for me the partnership – we even regulated in terms of a different policy, not as SCM policy but the sponsorship policy maybe.       But people have said, they have criticisedus on the World Cup because they applied.  And I think the SCM policy, Chair, is not an over policy of a business.  It is one policy of a business.  Sometimes you find conflict between some of that and we attend to reduce everything that no here is the standard.  And I do not think that is – that should be the case, Chair.     Because the bursaries, Chair, belong now Prodigy.      So if it agrees to work with us, it is effectively that to us.     So it is bringing something to the party.     What is it that the last word of business, the relationship starts.     When FIFA comes into the country, it runsthe World Cup, Chair, and PRASA does not say we are going to advertise, this is for the World Cup.  We entered into an agreement, a partnership with FIFA because they arrived, the branding belongs to FIFA.       We want to become a party into that.     The same happened in Brick City.  There is – some of my executives were saying but PRASA is a state-owned entity.  Can...  and it is appropriate land.  Isaid but where do you see something like that?  The land – the leading party in the partnership between the City of Durban and is a sphere of government.  We cannot take that land over just...  So we could not build our railway line or ratherthe station outside of a development.  We could not bring a contract and say we are advertising services.  Appoint a contractor who comes and dig in someone’s land.  We had to agree with that person and say part of the development of the mall, we wanted to include the station.  So we will not go out on tender, that it is not practical, Chair.  You cannot bring contractors to build a mall and then bring contractor to build an underground station in that mall because – and even from a structural point of view, they are going to have a problem.But if PRASA decides Chair on its own no offers of any kind from anyone that it wants to train a number of people it is obliged in terms of the procurement laws of the Republic to go out on that route.     At the time.     [Indistinct]      Chair, I think it arises ...[intervenes]      And there are two ways of dealing with it.     The first one they say    You well lose the values and the benefitthat you have acquired from that.     Because they may not translate softly.     From a cost point of view you are losing the benefits.  Remember the issue is value for money at all times.      The second option will be to say    ...to the process.     Now that doesn't mean a tender,necessarily Chair.     It means that, let the Adjudication Committee looks at it and say – because Chair this is very important.  so you may go out on tender, you may want to ask for increasing the scope of that work and I think that these documents are telling us all about that Chair.  So, yes, I accept what you are saying, Chair.  It may - the extension of that scope and then the numbers naturally invite that question Chair.    Which at that time we are not dealing with ...[intervenes]      ...but as you speak today, I do recognise ...[intervenes]      ...that in fact the scope maybe big ...[intervenes]      ...and that phase(?) may be different.     And therefore you may want to go free that process, Chair.     Page 138?     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     No, not at all Chair.     Yes, Chair.  I do not think it was the only one but I think that Prodigy is the one that came to PRASAand say we want to use ours with you.  the others may have used them in other environment's but yes I do not think it was the only company.     Chair, I think and I want to build on theconversation and the discussion that we had earlier on Chair because I think my comments on 217 in my review application which is part of my annexures to the Commission.  It is very clear Chair.  We have to decide - the Constitution says that.  The Constitution also says the organs of state will then implement these systems that we have because I do not think that it can be Chair that we say systems of - how do I put it - a fair transparent competitive process.    Cost effective as well.  Indeed.  A process.  And we say that the organs of state are required to put that in place.  When they - and then we have the PFMA.  We have for example the triple PFMA which both of them give exceptions and exemptions as well to what is happening.  Now Chair, I think what we should be because I think also - so that we do not also speculate about it.  We have got to do three things.  The first one we need toassess to evaluate purpose which other companies were given and specifically for what competencies.  What are the areas where for example Prodigy have these competencies and we others did not or they were given the same thing Chair.  That is the first issue. But I think even if they were two three other companies – if two other companies also approached PRASA and PRASA then rejected them and take Prodigy, that would have been unfair.  But we do not know of any other company Chair.  But I do not think because Seta a whole range of other things.  My view would be that we have the Commission may want to raise that issue with the Services Seta and say give us an input.  Tell us about this organisation.  Who had this thing said that when you gave - because that will help us Chair.  That is the first issue that is there.  But I do not share the view that any offer of a service requires a tender Chair.  And if you say it doesn't require a tender ...[intervenes]      Every ...[intervenes]      ...offer of a service.     Because some level of service is involvedChair.     But it doesn't mean every time you buy ...[intervenes]      ...you procure goods and services.  At a time there is a route to go.  and I do not think that was the intention of 217 either.  So.  but I think as a guiding principle it is correct.  I support that but not in all instances Chair.     And where organisations come to the party, not for you to buy services.  To then say we want to work with you here.  I think Chair ...[intervenes]      Let me give you an example Chair.  There is a school – there is an ...[indistinct] called Kukwano(?)  It trains young people and in maths and such And we have partnered with them.  No - And that is about, we choice - we want to position PRASA.  Again this is regulated by our sponsor sponsorship policy, not by hour ...[intervenes]      ...not by our SCM policy.  and so as you raise it Chair, I realise that they may be instances of conflict or that there is not a clear line between and wemay have to look at that again.     But for now I still maintain, Chair.     I think that year we have got a better dealwith the ...[intervenes]      How are they ...[intervenes]      Yet, Chair.     No, but Chair, I think I am saying that when you get it in the light of this discussion ...[intervenes]     ...it may be – unless if there – and that is why I am saying there are two routes.     If it was extended without any of thoseprocesses, we are here to - an open tender.     And we are going through adjudication Prodigy ...[intervenes]      ...to get pass there.  Then, of course Chair, you did not follow process.     But if the scope was dealt with by an Adjudication Committee and it recommended that it beapproved, Chair ...[intervenes]      ...that will still be within the – that system of governance ...[intervenes]      ...that we want to put in place.     Ja.    Exactly.     The issues ...[intervenes]      But even Chair, when the AdjudicationCommittee would have said yes.     The Commission having taken all the evidence ...[intervenes]      ...on the Seta/Prodigy ...[intervenes]      We still do not want to obtain an opinion ...[intervenes]      ...and say is this making the test of 217.     And then all of them at PRASA are considered.     But my fundamental point, Chair, is that where an entity private or public brings something – you cannot take out something to tender that does not belong to you.     And that is the point I am making.     Prodigy owned the bursaries.     They are not PRASA’s bursaries Chair.    So could not take them out on tender.     Indeed, Chair.     Yes.     Ja.     Sorry, in which paragraph are you on?     Do you want my comment?     No, Chair, I think let us read the first paragraph of that letter.     Because I do not think there are any inconsistencies there.  I think that we are dealing with the     But they have – if you again, Chair – again, we – I am happy that Mr Soni says it is a matter that we can debate and – well, I am using two words.  I am using partnership and then later I use the word MOU.  Now if we follow what Mr Soni says, it therefore means that the MMD-4, it could have been a contract, a partnership or it could have been an MOU but we are giving effect to one and the same thing that is proposed in the letter.  And Chair, why did I write on top of it?  Because this was not a secret.  I did not even know that the five or ten years down the line I would be sitting here, debating and looking at my words.  At that time, we have received this offer that 300 bursaries awarded by the Seta.  Can itbe used at PRASA?  And we used that to – as a springboard for our Centre of Excellence.  And Chair we have accepted that and I think for me, that is the essence of what you said of what we wanted to achieve.  They did not need to go through a tender.  I think Chair, I am saying ...[intervenes]      Let us look at that.  I think we will discuss the process.     And I am quite – I think that is my view on the matter Chair.       Chair, I think I will say yes and no.  It is quite clear to me, Chair, when I look at this letter that thisletter was a culmination point, was not the beginning so we do not have, as we sit here, details of the kind of discussions that took place between PRASA and Prodigy.     Prior to this letter because that is very important, Chair.  And secondly, we do not have the details of the basis and the terms and conditions of the award by the SETA. We are offered this thing, we think that we reached an agreement, so we need to look at that because that willthen tell us and answer Mr Soni’s question and ultimately the bigger question about is this in violation of 217 or not or should be dealt with differently.So I think a more factual approach, Chair, will help us to come to a common determination of - but when weapproved it at that time, Chair, I think that Prodigy was giving us or putting something on the table and I stated earlier on that they were not giving to us just for mahala, Chair, because it is quite clear that their business is training.  So if they link with our centre, of course that they are strategically go in a better position to even do more.  So that is the nature of the animal, Chair.     It was PRASA, Chair.     Yes.     No, I do not think in regard to – no, the rest of the other training, Chair, the first one I think it was – you will recall, Chair, was a model here.  They offer you, you train, you recover the money.    So both for the 300 and the 3 000.     PRASA would recover the money from the different SETAs.  You remember the other money is notonly coming from the Services SETA it also comes from the Transport SETA.     For the 300 [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     But the others were – the other, Chair, the other 3 000 was not part of that, that will come from the …[intervenes]    Yes.     No, Chair, PRASA will spend the money but will still cover that same money from the SETA.     No, no, Chair, it could exceed that amount.     Remember, SETA tells you about what itcan find but that may not be the real total cost of training.     So if it is beyond that, even what you claim, you are not going to get everything that you claim.     But you can get a large chunk of what you spent on top of that project then.     Chair …[intervenes]     With regard to – I think this is linked…[intervenes]          Ja, this is linked to skills mainly, Chair,because you are raising an important issue.  I mean, the other question linked to what you have just raised, Chair, why does SETAs not, for example, why does it have to go through service providers and not for example linked directly with PRASA and I think the question is who has got the skills?  We run trains, we run buses, we run property and therefore we may not have the – what is it called, the necessary accreditation in those areas that are there so that is why we have got the service providers.  Is it a more efficient model, Chair?  I think that is another question.  Perhaps the SETAs should as a first line say public entities or other organs of state, here is money that you can access, you can apply and part of that is happening, Chair, when you can apply but I think that there are certain areas where you do that through the service providers.  I do not know what is the rationale, the logic, Chair, that is not my space but I know that there will be offered – we will be offered to use the services.  So we have to then check under what circumstances was this offered.     What were the times and then we clarify that question first.     Chair, you put me in a very difficult position.  Mr Soni had confirmed that …[intervenes]     That by five we will be done.     The Commission will not want to see me here again, Chair.  Chair, I will be guided by you.     And then perhaps we can try to do theother two remaining matters tomorrow.     Chair, I do not know the date but I know that second addendum was signed by Ms Koka but also I do not the specific concern that Mr Dingiswayo had, Chair.     Ja.     Mr Holele is younger than me, Chair, I do not know when there is a young man he assumes it should be me.  He is far younger than me, Chair.  So surely I thought he would be looking at someone else.Chair, I do not know, I say Mr Holele’s testimonywhere he called me a dictator and I have been making the statement but I had left PRASA by this time, I think two years earlier so I do not have direct knowledge of what was discussed in the meeting, Chair.     Okay.     No, Mr Zamxaka, Chair, was the – well, I do not know because here he was the CEO of our technical division and I assume therefore that the part of the traininghappened with his team, Chair.     I am saying that PRASA Technical is one of the divisions of PRASA, he was the CEO.     Yes, Chair, it was my property, he was put there by me, Chair.     Well, Mr Zamxaka, Chair, I do not want to discuss his personal matters but for some personal reasons he was going through a process and he rented a place in the City Centre of Johannesburg, in Pretoria, and I did not even know about that, Chair, because he did not tell, it was none of my – it had nothing to do with me.  I meant to see him one evening, I could not find him and I knew that he lived in Pretoria, I was also in Pretoria, and I could only see him the following day.  Then he told me and explained, you know, he could not come and I realised that we have one of our CEOswas actually living in the middle of Johannesburg and I identified the risk and then I arranged – I said look, I have got a property that I have just developed, if you can stay there in the meantime whilst you are trying to sort yourself out, Chair.  So there is nothing – it has got nothing to do with Mr van der Walt or anything, it was me offering a brother a place to stay whilst he was going through a particular phase in his life, Chair.     Chair, before we move to there.  Mr Soni, I see you are jumping 4.18, 4.18 above.  Can I read it out to     No, no, Chair, I see that and that is what conspiracies do, Chair.  When you formulate these things in your head and they become – you know, sometimes you create this thing, Chair, with your own hand, your own labour and it become a fetish, something you start to worship because you think it has got power over you, yet you havecreated it, it is product of your own labour.  We are seeing it in this report, Chair.   Ms Konduwe worked for PRASA for a very long time.  In HR, in fact I think she joined Metro Rail before it was even PRASA.  I think she was part of South African Airways, one of the highly experienced HR executive or senior managers in that environment, so why was she brought in to rescue anything?  So you can see, I am not surprised why 4.18 comes in, Chair, because here is a guy who does not even know me.  He has probably never even seen me, he onlyknows my name from reading reports and he decided to right something like that.  What was she rescuing?   You see, Chair, I mentioned earlier on when we were dealing with the affidavit of Dingiswayo, that there are insinuations, but we are not told what it is.  Now there it is, Iam saving – I am bringing her to save something.  What is it that needs to be saved?  I am asking myself, Chair.So these are the type of things and unless if this chap is asked to elaborate and assist the Commission to understand what is he saying in his report?  I think that is something that should not be taken lightly, Chair.     Well, I do not know, someone who hasbeen 2017, I do not know Majola to what extent he was involved with those processes, what he has, what evidence he has looked at.  I was just noting, I do not even want to comment because I do not know what as the purpose of this report but I see attacks on me that are so unjustified that know that the basis – but, Chair, I do not want to take up on this report, I would just note in picking up points as we are speaking, Mr Soni.     I think, Chair, that has been the subject of our discussion.     Well, Chair, I think the summary that we made earlier on particularly on getting the right information  to enable to make – to enable the Commission to make an informed determination and come to 217.  I think Majola’s report, Chair, is – Jabuli Sam Majola, I do not think, Chair, is someone who probably was not senior enough or was not aware, is an investigator who looks at the – who probably wanted to know the facts without looking at the bigger picture but I would not dismiss it, I would allow it that we can test everything he says.    Once we have obtained that information, Chairperson, [indistinct – dropping voice]     Which page are you on?    Oh, back to his affidavit?     Okay.    I am there, Chair, 110.     Chair, I think throughout the day I went into details to show that Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit, number one is based on hearsay but clearly that here is a man who is playing politics.  I explained his role how selective he was.  Now I would ask a simple practical question.  When Prodigy engaged with the Group HR of PRASA, who was involved in that discussion and under whose instructionwere they taking those decisions because then that is what clarifies the issue.  But when I look at this, I think it is devoid of truth, devoid of fact, it is playing – it is searching for Roy Moodley.  I have said in my affidavit that they want – they could not find the Guptas at PRASA and they had tofind a new Gupta and that new Gupta is Roy Moodley.  Chair, I think that I have explained, people had thought even Moodley was appointed at PRASA.  He was never appointed at PRASA, he was inherited from Transnet in 1991 and the very same people who make these kind of statements actually recommended, Chair, the list of security companies that needed to be extended that were recommended by the Bid Adjudication Committee, was done under the leadership of Tiro Holele and Dingiswayo’s boss, Ms Martha Ngoyi.   Now did they not know Roy Moodley at that time when they recommended?  Now suddenly we have got state capture, they want to show that Moodley is so powerful.  There was never a Gupta at PRASA, there was never a Moodley that dominated PRASA and I think that a lot of people may have their views about PRASA but, Chair, I said earlier on during the day – I said firstly, you will never find a single project at PRASA that we implemented that we spent money on and it was not done, where you say money disappeared.  Not a single one, Chair.The second thing, Chair, you will not find the Guptas but you see, people who investigated PRASA, they thought they will find Jacob Zuma and the Guptas at PRASA and that is why they are trying to draw – create the links and all of those things.  There is none, Chair.  But when you areCEO of an entity like PRASA, there are a lot of interest in this business including people who tell us that they are biggest fighters against state capture.   Chair, when I present my evidence, you will actually see that the people who have given us lectures in this Commission about state capture, were the forefront of the destruction of PRASA.  For example, Minister Pravin said in his testimony here that one way state capture works is by changing boards, changing cabinets and other organs of – but that is exactly what they did with PRASA and got itwhere it is, Chair. So I think that ultimately you have to be guided by the facts, separate facts from fiction and look at these issues dispassionately, Chair, and we will find that Mr Dingiswayo is running away from the very issue.  She was an instrument, Chair, I am not surprised that between his affidavit and the affidavit of Mr Molefe, which we dealt with on Friday and the affidavit of Martha Ngoyi, the affidavit of Tiro Holele, all of these affidavits shows people who were  actually articulating from the same position but they cannotgive – my personal knowledge, Chair, I never spoke about – I heard somebody saying this, I wanted to focus on facts, on evidence that I present to this Commission. So, Chair, Mr Dingiswayo, fired him, he was bitter, so he will not come here and praise me and say Mr Montanadid a good work.  Ms Ngoyi, I removed her as CEO of Intersite and I fired her from the business.  So I do not expect this – and, Chair, I am not in a beauty contest, I do not like the – I have never run an entity where people like me.  In fact I love it when 90% of people I have managed do not like me and I only have ten.  Ten good quality people and we make things happen, Chair. So in short, Mr Soni, I do not think Dingiswayo seriously and I do not think this affidavit is worth the paper written on.    No, Chair, I am in your hands exceptwhen we discussed with Mr Soni you said the person who is coming was going to be very brief.     Half past ten.

MONTANA:Chair I can confirm we had one partnership agreement with Prodigy of course there were addendums over a period of time that we had indeed.   And that is why it is aimed at incentivising both public and private companies to invest inskills in the country, Chair.     Chair, when I went on leave in December 2014, Ms Ngoye acted in my position.  But in January, before I came back there, I think I was coming back late in the middle or late January 2015.  I was calledto Cape Town by the Minister of Transport.  I was still on  And you asked Chair, correctly ...[intervenes]   I have made that decision, and ...[intervenes]      Once you got all of that, Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAS SONI SC:   I am sorry, Mr Montana.  I – you saw me smile and the reason I smile is somebody said to me that the Gupta’s were from India.  Roy Moodley was the Gupta from KZN.     But I – that ...[intervenes]      That is what somebody said to me.  That is the reason I smiled.     But ...[intervenes]     As you please, Chair.  So, Mr Montana, coming back to 14.1.We know that Ms Shunmugam sent you the letter on the 10 t h of June and you wrote a note on the letter.  I just want to read, if you do not mind, for the record what is contained in part of the letter and in part of your response.     We are at page 138, Mr Montana.  The black 138.       138.     Yes, Chair.  So Ms Shunmugam says and the letter is addressed to PRASA, for your attentionand it says in respect of piloting of Centre of Excellence     Alright.  And he(sic) saying in the     Alright.  And you signed that on thet h of June.     The same day that ...[intervenes]     [Indistinct]  [Speakers intervening each other – unclear]     2010.     Yes, Chair.     As you please, Chairperson.  Now, I just want to ask.  If you look at these figures on page 138, the amount per learner would be R 6000,00.  Would that be correct, Mr Montana?     Page 138.  We are still at the Prodigy letter.     Because it is R 18 million for 300 hundred learners that would be R 6 000,00 per learner.      Now then ...[intervenes]      Now in this case, was it a situation where PRASA paid Prodigy and then claimed from Seta because that is what the letter seems to say or was it that Prodigy claimed from Seta?  I am just trying to – because that is what the letter seems to be say.  Do you know or do you not?     Or PRASA, obviously, the advantage was that it was getting still training for its employees.  For Prodigy it was the fact that it was getting work through the tune of R 18 million.       And the time …[intervenes]     As you please, Chairperson.  Then he     Oh, sorry.    Oh, sorry.     Oh, sorry, sorry.     We are back at page 101, yes.     So if I can just go back so that we are all on the same lines, as it were, we started off on theJune.  The letter was sent then you made the inscription on the letter.  Those are the first three sentences of paragraph 14.1, Mr Montana.    And he makes the point that – or in the agreement, it is noted that you signed on behalf of PRASA.     Yes.  Then he says    And then on 31 October 2012    Yes.  Sorry, at page 177.  That is your signature there, is it?     Okay.      At page 177, Chair.     Now he says as far as this part is concerned, you could go to page 174, Mr Montana.  You will see that this tells you what the cost is and right at the bottom of page 174 this says the cost per learner is R24 000 and the cost of 3 000 learners is R72 million.    174, right at the bottom.     Yes.     Right.  Now I just have in relation to – remember I asked you in regard to the 300 learners we agreed that the cost was R6 000 per learner.     Now two things happened here and I am giving you the opportunity to explain.  One is, the number of learners increases from 300 to 3 000.  That is correct, is it not?  Now just in relation to that, as Iunderstood your evidence earlier, PRASA could be able to claim from SETA for the 300 learners.  Would it be able to claim in respect of these 3 000 learners as well?     So although the numbers increased it would still be SETA that pays.     But what amount will it claim?     Indeed, Chair, but they will have to verify whether the training did indeed take place.     Now in regard to the contract we are talking about at page 174, I mean, where the figure is at 174, the figure for the learner is R24 000, the figure originally agreed with Prodigy was R6 000 per learner.  That I can understand SETA would pay.  Would SETA still pay four times that amount for each learner if you claimed that from SETA?     Well, this is what intrigues me, if I were the head of SETA, whichever SETA it is, I am told in the original agreement in 2010 that it costs R6 000 thatthey will claim for each person trained and then in 2012 they will claim R24 000 for each person claiming.  Why should I, as the head of SETA, pay you R24 000 when two years ago a SETA was paying R6 000?     Who determines the amount of R24 000 for each trainee?     Chairperson, I just want to clear three or four things, I know it is tea time but I thought I would just clear them.  Mr Dingiswayo says that in regardto this program at page 174, the duration of the training was five days.  Do you agree?     174.     The same one we were dealing with, yes, it is cost per learner 24,000 and cost of 3000.  You want to come back to that issue., after you…[intervene]     Actually, he says that - if you look at     Because I do not want usto…[intervene]     This Prodigy contract was not linked to the World Cup at all.     Yes, I just wanted to - because I heard you say something about the World Cup and then getting our…[intervene]     I just did not want there to be a linkbetween this…[intervene]     As you please Chair.     As you please Chair.     14.2.     Mister ...[intervenes]      Agreement.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.     I am going to come to ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Now he says at 14.2    Alright.  And you accept that he was asked to extend those two earlier contracts?     Alright.  He then continues and I am still at 14.2. “After reviewing the matters, I raised a number of compliance issues...”Were you aware of that?     Ja-no, I do not think he says heraised it with you.  He was asked by the contracts manager and it seems that he raises it with them.  And then he goes     Yes.    Yes.     The answer is either yes or no, Mr Montana whether sent the email or not.    And then at 14.3 he says    As you please, Chair.  He then says     Alright.  Then let us turn to page 14 – well, I mean, paragraph 14.5.     Chairperson, the difficulty with thatis, he did not have it.       As you will see ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.    Chairperson, the difficulty and as you will see, he says that the email showed that Ms Shunmugam knew what was going on in PRASA.  So it was obviously an important email.     When I asked after the email, his answer to me was that he was on suspension at the time and he had no access to his email.  So that is why he could not produce it.     No, no, no.  I am talking about at the Commission now.       At the time ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Then at 14.5 he says    Oh, Kondowe.     Sorry. “I set out my concerns in an email which I sent to, among others, Ms Kondowe. I also sent this email to the then Group Procurement Officer, Mr Pongola...”Are you aware of that emails?     Alright.  Then at 14.6 he says    14.6.  It is at the top of page 103.          We will get to that in a moment.  Let me just deal with this issue that you raised.  Did you share the view that the contracts were invalid, you yourself?     Okay.  And that the reason it should be proceeded with is because Prodigy was in this.  You did not share that?     Okay but now we know – we readyour criticism(?), Mr Montana.  Let us move on.  You have made your point that it is too vague.  I am just asking you     Have you got that?     This is the email you were asking –you were hoping would be in the annexures.  Am I right/     Alright.  Let us just look at this email.  This is an email sent from you.  Is that correct?     Yes.  Alright.  And it is dated the     No, no, no.  I ...[intervenes]     No, Mr Montana, you must accept that I have heard everything you say.  I am asking a question so that the record will ...[intervenes]      And it is CC’d to a number of people. And the subject matter...  Oh, sorry.  Including Ms Ngoye.      Now that is the contract we were talking about, the hundred and – I mean, the R 72 million contract.  Is that right?     Now in the email you say    Right.      Then it goes on to say    As you please, Chair.  The extent of     Is it not Allan Ganghia.     Yes.  Then let us get back to the – we have dealt with your email, Mr Montana.     Now this is – in fairness to him, Mr Dingiswayo’s comment on your email and it appears at the     Yes.     He does not do that in so many words, he does that in regard to the SLA, Chair.     Chairperson, perhaps I can suggest why it is done that way.     Given what he says about the contract.    You asked earlier, Chairperson, whether there was a procurement policy and perhaps I should just ask Mr Montana the question now because that may…    Reduce the sting of the question that you are posing to him.     Mr Montana, may I ask you, we have been through how the agreement came into being.  Was there procurement policy [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     I say was there a procurement policies before first agreement was concluded between Prodigy and PRASA?     But I do not want to us to confuse this and this is why might remember just before tea I asked you – I said to you the first contract is in October 2010, itcould not be related to FIFA.  So let us leave FIFA out of it.     I have got no difficulty, I just did not want that…     Because it seems to be a – I do not think Mr Montana intended or intends it that way.    Just for record purposes I wanted – and because we are talking about 2010, I just wanted to draw that distinction.     But I accept both what you say and what Mr Montana says.     Now, Mr Montana, within SCM processes in organs of state, and PRASA is an organ ofstate, there is a mechanism to deal with what is called an unsolicited offer, is that correct?     What that indication to enter into a partnership be what one would call an unsolicited offer?    So you, as you sit here, cannot say whether this was treated as unsolicited – when you were given advice that we should accept it, you do not know whether your legal section was saying you could do it because it is an unsolicited bid and it fits the requirement or whether it was being done on some treasury regulation.     This is the 2010 agreement.     So, Chairperson, this set of questions was in relation to your question about the general acceptance and the reason I say that is generally when it is an internal …[intervenes]    Well …[intervenes]     If there was an internal process that was flawed then the contractor is regarded as innocent.    And that is the only point I want to make.     Which I suspect is what – I am not saying it is.     But it would justify that notion.     No, sure.     Thank you.    As you please Chairperson.  Mr Montana, we had just finished paragraph 14.6.  We now go to paragraph 14.7 which is ...[intervenes]     Oh sorry, page 103.     Remember looking on the left hand side, the numbers in black.    At paragraph 14.7 Mr Dingiswayo    “I asked if it could wait until the following day.  She phoned back to say he wished to see me personally that evening.”Is that correct?    She says she spoke to Ms Ngoye in    “He thanked me for coming back to work from home and made light of this by chuckling.”    “He then indicated that he had been told that I was one of the people who wereworking against the interest of PRASA on a number of matters and that I was abusing my position as one of the legal advisors of PRASA.”Now that is the point you made earlier.     But did you tell him that, that ...[intervenes]     “He cited as an example that I hadtold PRASA employees to cancel some tender.”Did you tell him that?      That is the issue you raise that he started from around November the previous year.     “I indicated to him in my position that I had no powers to tell people to cancel tenders and that I had not given any such advice.”Now obviously on your version that could not havehappened because you did not allege that he had cancelled anything, or did you tell him that?    No, it certainly does.     Mr Montana, you said that there was an email that Mr Lindikaya had sent which had a list of contracts.  Do you have that email?    Can I ask you this, on that ... I meanthere must be contracts that were on that, were listed in that email that you will remember.  Was Prodigy one of those contracts?    You think or was it?   Swifambo?    Siyangena?    Any other that you can remember?    And Royal Security?   Strawberry Works?    As it pleases.  Mr Montana, let me ask you this because the impression that I get reading Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit, is the reason you called Mr Dingiswayo on the 19 t h at seven in the evening is to inform him that you had decided to dismiss him.    So you had made up your mind before the meeting and the purpose of the meeting was to communicate ...[intervenes]    And the purpose of the meeting was to tell him that you are dismissed.     Mr Montana, let me ask you.  When had you firmly decided that you are going to fire MrDingiswayo?    Your state of mind.   And the reason I ask is you do not say that in that email.  I gather that that was on your mind when you wrote that email because you recall I asked you, do you confirm that the email was sent at 15H14 PM.  You remember?  This is on the 18 t h.   And now we are looking at 27 hours later, when you meet Mr Dingiswayo, say you are dismissed.  The question I want to ask you is at the time you wrote the email, had you decided that you were going to dismiss ...[intervenes]     So at the time you wrote this email on the 18 t h you had already made up your mind?    As you please Chairperson.  Mr Montana, I do not want us to debate.  I am just going to present this and you must comment.     There are two rules of natural justice.  The one rule is hear the other side, audi alterum partum, and the other rule is you should not be a judge in your ownCourt, [indistinct].  Now I am not trying to sound clever, but in this case you broke the rules. You did not give him a hearing and you yourself took the decision.      Yes.     Can I ask you at the time you wrote the email of the 18 t h of May, the one we have talked about, you said you had decided that Mr Dingiswayo must go.  You had already made up your mind.     And was that the same with regard to Martha?    So we know now ...[intervenes]     As it pleases.     So we know now in relation to both of them at least you had decided on the 18 t h that they would go.      Yes.     Was that the same with Mr Khuswayoand Mr Denge as well?    But ...[intervenes]     Now we do not then need to read too much more of this part of Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit.  He says that there was a debate, well I mean a conversation    Okay, and he says he had said that if you are going to terminate my contract, I am not going to be a party to an unlawful termination.  Did he tell you that?    He was?    Yes.    Then he says you told him that he could wait for his letter of termination or indicate where he would like it to be delivered did you tell him that.     Before you had decided to terminatetheir services or after?  In other words, when you ask them to craft the letter was the crafting merely to say, I have made up my mind, just put it down in writing, to comply with whatever.  Was that your state of mind?    Yes indeed Chair.    I - and this is my last question on this.  You did consult the head of HR, they advised you against the ...[indistinct], you weighed the situation, you examined your duties as the CEO, and you decided that you were going to go through with the decision, with your decision, would that be a correct summation?     And he says at 14.12 on page 105    No, no, no.    How long did the meeting last?    Alright then he deals with Ms Ngoyi and we'll deal with that when we deal with what he says about her because this is now ...[intervenes]      As you please Chairperson.  Let’s leave 14.13 and 14.14 out, because as I say they deal with Ms Ngoyi who we will deal with her tomorrow, or later this    So in other words when he says thereis a possibility that you were invested in this transaction is not something we can exclude, we would have to put it on to the equation because we know now at the time you wrote your email that you were writing it in connection with questions that had been raised about Prodigy. I accept the general background you're given, but I am nevertheless saying that the chairperson when assessing if there is a link we have to take that into account, would that be correct?     138 Chair.    Yes, indeed, and you immediately on the same day said the proposal must be accepted.    That's the 10th of June 2010 is that right?    Now independently of this the Commission has evidence that Royal Security, who is a company owned by Mr Roy Moodley and we've been through that already, had between July 2007 and June 09 paid an amount of R64 000 monthly to Mr Zuma as an employee of Royal Security. Are you aware of that?     Okay, I am saying to you, we have the bank statements to established that, and one of the questions I want to ask you just arising from investment in this, and of course the allegations being made that you favoured Moodley. This contract that is now the subjectmatter of the court application and that has caused the dismissal of few people in legal, namely Mr Dingiswayo, Ms Ngoyi comes a year after Mr Zuma becomes president, and Mr Moodley has stopped him giving him R64 000.   Is - I am asking you to comment because there must be room to say there could be a link.     Okay, Mr Montana perhaps – this seems a bit clumsy, but I was not suggesting that Royal itself, Royal Security had been improperly appointed, there is no evidence. What we do have is Prodigy is irregularly appointed, I am saying that is the allegation.    But Mr Montana, you must in fairness to me listen to the question. I said, there are allegations, I am not saying it was Prodigy, and you know because Mr. Dingiswayo has raised that already.     No, no, no I understand, but you have seen here, and I am merely saying that given that the Commission is obliged to consider is there a link? Not because Prodigy I mean, not because Royal Security was improperly appointed, but that a company linked to MrMoodley, who has been financing President Zuma is now given a contract over which a cloud has been put, I am not saying over which there is a cloud.  That's the only point I am making.     As you please, Chairperson.     Indeed.  There is Chairperson.  I do not want to unnecessarily ...[intervenes]      ...go into trivial matters.     There are two matters that arises.  Can I ask you, Mr Montana, to please look at page 138? That is the invitation to - from Prodigy to you.     138, yes.  That is MNG-3.     Now in the second paragraph it says    Alright.  Can I ask you this?  You accepted this on the very same day.  And I know there were discussions previously because they say that in paragraph – the first paragraph.    Were you involved in those discussions?     Now were you aware whether it was only Prodigy that had been awarded that bursary funding?  Because when I look at this it does not say it was the only entity awarded that fund(?).       But then I am saying to you Mr Montana that it is not for us to water down the wording off the constitution. We are not talking about ordinary law.  we are talking about the fundamental document that determines our public authorities conduct themselves.  Now if Prodigy was not the only entity which had that facility, is there not - and I would like you to look at itnow - is there not the necessity to say are the in entities and should be not look at Section 217 so that Prodigy is not unfairly given an advantage because it simply approached...?     Cost effective ...[intervenes]      Mr Montana, just finally on this.  Pages 138 and 139 is Prodigy’s letter and I am just dealingwith the letter, not your inscription on the letter.     You will see that the heading of the letter of is Piloting of Centre of Excellence Model and Learnership Implementation.  If you go to page 139 in the     Sorry.  On page 139 ...[intervenes]      Ja.  It says in the second sentence    Yes.     Well, Mr Montana, I do not want us to debate this.  I am going to disagree with you.  There is no consistency between what you have proposed and the proposal from Prodigy.  We will disagree on it and at the end of the day, it is a question of interpreting what they have said, your response to it.And I just want to point out that if you look at MNG-4 on page 141, you will see that what emerges is the partnership agreement, not the contract to pilot the Centreof Excellence that they have proposed in their letter of 10 June.     As you please.     Sorry, Chairperson, sorry, yes.     Yes, okay.     No, no, no.     Mr Montana, at paragraph 14.17 Mr Dingiswayo says that after he was dismissed the SLA that he had reservations about were signed on the 29 May, is that correct?  This is at paragraph 14.17 at page 106.     Okay.  He then raises certain questions about the enforceability of the contract.  We do not need to date them now because the only reason, MrMontana, is that that whole matter is before court at the moment.  We have agreed on that.     Alright.  May I then ask you to look at paragraph 14.21?  September 2017, and he has beencorrected on this, it is in February/March 2017, that was the evidence.  Ms Shunmugum – now she is the lady who wrote to you, you might remember, asked to meet Mr     You see, what for the Commission is not without significance and I am not saying it is of extreme significance is that three months – I mean, three weeks after that meeting Ms Dipuo Peters is replaced as the minister and I am just saying that as a Commission these are not matters we can ignore.    Once that evidence is before us and so to the extent that you think Mr Moodley is being focused upon, the reason is because there is those pieces of evidence as against [indistinct – dropping voice]Now in paragraph 15 he says that Mr Majola conducted the – an investigation into the Prodigy contracts and it is a report that is in fact annexed to his affidavit.  Now I would just like you to turn to page 128 which deals with the report.  I do not want us to look at the whole report but justtwo parts of the report that – or three parts of the report.  If I can ask you, the report starts at page 128 and I would like you to turn to page 135.     Part of the training…?     Oh, I see.  [indistinct – dropping voice] yes.  Now just relating to Mr Zamxaka, I am going to go into something we are going to deal with tomorrow.  One of the properties we are investigating is the Parkwood property.  In that property there is – there was an addendum to the sale – your sale to – that you [indistinct] of thatproperty and it is recorded in the addendum that Mr Zamxaka was in fact a tenant in that property.  Is that so?     Okay, so he was renting from you?    Okay.  Can I ask you now to look at paragraph 5.4?    Yes.  And now that – I did not want to raise matters relevant to you but can I ask you to look at     As you please, Chairperson.  Then at     Yes.  And then just finally, I want to refer you to 5.5 which is – which reiterates what is said I    Yes.     And the question, as I understand it, is whether given the nature of the relationship and the contract that ensued, Section 217 and the tender process was triggered.  Would that be a fair summary of what we have been debating?    Finally, in regard to Mr Dingiswayo, Mr Montana, I just want us to look at paragraph 19.  He     Oh sorry, page 110, back to his affidavit, sorry.     Yes.     110, Mr Montana.     Right at the bottom, paragraph 19 he     Chairperson, I do not have any other matters arising from Mr Dingiswayo’s affidavit.     I have exhausted everything I want to ask, Chairperson.     Mr Ngoli(?) and Mr Ollermann’s report.
INQUIRY RESUMES:
ADV VAS SONIC SC:  Now Mr Montana Mr Dingiswayo doesn't say, you know, as part of the investigating team and the legal team of PRASA – or sorry, of the Commission, investigating PRASA, we would have to takeinto account all relevant facts. Can I show this to you?  If you look at page 138, you don't need to go to the that's the letter from Ms Shunmugum to you inviting the partnership between PRASA and Prodigy. 
ADV VAS SONI:   Chairperson may the PRASA team be excused.     As you wish.
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good afternoon Chair.     Yes we are ready to lead the witness, Dr Isaac Dintwe, but there an application before you and I presume those would want to ask you firstly tohear the application and if you are going to hear it Chair to address you on it?     Well perhaps the ...[intervenes]     I am not the right person to ask, we have our own views, it is late.     Yes Judge perhaps I ...[intervenes]     I am being collegial Chair.   Chair the witness before you is Dr Setlhomamaru Isaac Dintwe.  May he be sworn.     Thank you Chair.  Chair you have before you a bundle, Bundle SSA2B.       In that bundle are three exhibitsand the statement of Dr Dintwe is Exhibit YY15.     I will ask that it be admitted in due course.  Dr Dintwe do you have Exhibit ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair I will explain theposition with regard to annexures.     In due course.     Dr Dintwe do you have ExhibitYY15 before you?     Would you go please to page, and these are the black numbers in the top left hand corner, SSA2775, we will just be referring to the last three numbers, but always the black numbers on the top left hand corner, do you see SSA2775?     Is that the first page of your affidavit?    Please go to page 835, that is the last page.     Yes whose signature is that above the name Isaac Dintwe, Setlhomamaru Isaac Dintwe?     Your signature, are you satisfied that the contents of this affidavit insofar as you are aware are true and correct?    There are no annexures to this affidavit as the Chair has pointed out, we will explain in due course, but there are indeed intended to be annexures, certain of those documents need to be declassified, eitherby yourself or by the State Security Agency or another appropriate instance and that process is still underway?      And in due course you may return to identify the relevant documents?       Dr Dintwe you are at present the Inspector General of Intelligence?     Yes please I do.     YY15.    Thank you Chair.  Dr Dintwe - may I proceed?  Thank you Chair.   Dr Dintwe you are the Inspector General of Intelligence, is that correct?    When were you appointed, by the President?     And in terms of which piece oflegislation were you appointed?     Before we deal with the contents of your affidavit perhaps by way of certain preliminary remarks we can inform the Chair why you are here to giveevidence and in summary what topics you are going to cover.  You are aware of the fact that certain evidence has already been given by or on behalf of members of the State Security Agency.     And in accordance with the Constitution the State Security Agency is subject to civilianoversight, correct.        So the three arms of State Security, Intelligence, Crime Intelligence and State Security Agency fall within your oversight purview?     And you are currently in office as the Inspector General of Intelligence, performing that oversight mechanism?    Now you will deal I understand it with the nature and functioning of the Office of the IGI, the Chair is concerned in this and other fields with the question of oversight and your evidence will deal with two aspects in regard to that oversight, as I understand it firstly aspects relating to the independent of the Office of the IGI?     And secondly the powers of theIGI.     And then you will deal with a number of factual issues relating to your office, its independence, its hours and how these are dealt with byother statutory bodies or officials.     You will also I understand deal with matters relating to the operational relationship between the office of the IGI, the relevant Minister and State Security, the State Security Agency and other security instances.     Relevant to the information that you are going to place before the Chair and certainly will place before the Chair when the declassification processhas been concluded, both on your part and the part of the SSA, is Section 78A of the Oversight Act, you deal with that in paragraph 4 of your statement, what does that provide?     Yes, we will address the issue in due course from our point of view Chair.     One question in that regard.  This document, is it classified?      Not classified.  We know it is in the public domain.    Right.  In paragraph 4 of youraffidavit Dr Dintwe, you refer to Section 7(8)B as being the origin of the duty to consult.  Sorry, you refer to 7(8)A of, as the section providing the duty to consult.  If I may just refer you to 7(8)B of the Oversight Act. It is in the bundle of legislation in front of you.  Chair, you should have that bundle.  At page 129.  We just need to clarify disclosure and declassification and how they work with one another or do not work with one another. Section 7 deals with the appointment, hours andduties of the inspector general.  You see that?    Section 7(8)B says that   And you will consider the provisions of the section, apply them and in due course produce the documents, subject to whatever restrictions you may deemnecessary.     That will allow you to disclose to the Chair if there is a document that is never the lessclassified, at the hands of another state entity for example the SSA, before it is made public the classification would never the less be necessary. That is as we understand the position.    Yes.  So Chair, there are two processes that must be dealt with in the compilation of the annexures.  The first is the disclosure to yourself of the documentary evidence, and the second is to the extent that it is declassified. We will approach the authorities for the appropriate declassification.  If the classification is not forthcoming, then it will only be you who has access to the documents.     So has there been a consultation process Dr Dintwe?    And was it successfully completed? MR    Yes, and have you received any confirmation from the president that the consultative process has been completed?    And the wording of the section is instructive.  You may make your decisions regarding disclosure as stated in the section after consultation, not in consultation, as I understand the law in that regard it means that the decision ultimately is your decision.    Was that consultative process an easy process?   Right.  A complaint was lodged against you in relation to your providing information to the commission.  What was that complaint and who made the complaint?    Right.  So the fact that you had engaged ...[intervenes]     And ...[intervenes]     And the allegation ...[intervenes]     I am sorry Chair.     So the letter that you received mentioned a recommendation that you should be suspended.  Did the, or those ... the recommendation thatyou should be suspended was contained in the complaint by the three ministers, am I correct?    You then received a letter from the president.  What did he say to you in that letter?   Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence, the parliamentary ...[intervenes]     Joint Standard Committee on Intelligence.     Yes, and all this was happening at the time you were seeking to consult with the ministers about your engagement or further engagement with the commission. MR    Did you appear before the jointstanding committee of intelligence?    And what was the outcome of that process?    In any event, has that matter now been put to rest?    Okay, alright.  So that is where that is for the moment.  Paragraph 6, you talk of an attempt was made to pursued you to limit your evidence.  Would you just tell the Chair about that please?      Yes, that letter is a matter of record, Chair.    Thanks Chair, we will put together that correspondence.  It is already in the bundle Chair.     And it ...[intervenes]     Right Chair.    So to summarise in so far as there was a suggestion or a directive or however you want to phrase it that you should limit your evidence before the commission or your disclosures before the commission, you have decided what to say and the extent to which information should be disclosed.     Right, because the duties and powers of the inspector general are embedded in the constitution and in legislation, it is necessary for us brieflyto go through the framework which governs your office.  It is also relevant to the Chair, because the Chair is concerned about the oversight activities, their successes of failures in relation to the various aspects of evidence that we have heard and particularly the evidenceemanating from state security agency witnesses. Paragraph 7, you refer to Section 210 of the Constitution.  You see that?    And sub B of that section reads    Right, and the Oversight Act also provides for another oversight body.  What is that?      Right, and to whom are you accountable in terms of the legislative framework?      Right.    Right, now ...[intervenes]  MR    Right, so joint committee and notjust a portfolio committee?    Now you have said that you were responsible or accountable as IGI to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence, and not to any other instance.  I presume that includes the minister?    But in your evidence and certainly in the submissions and summaries we will put before you Chair, we will show that the legislation is far from clear, and there are anomalies in the legislation and certainly in the way the legislation is interpreted and applied, that below the lines of accountability, below at the very least.  Am I correct in that observation and we will deal with that in due course?      And one of the considerations inrelation to independent oversight, is to look at the legislation and we will address you and the report in due course in that regard Chair.  But in paragraph 9 you deal with the details of your appointment, and you have told the Chair of that. You say you were appointed by the President and the National Assembly passed the resolution for your appointment on the 29 t h of November 2016.      And you say it was passed by significantly more than the two thirds majority required by the constitution.  Is that correct?    Right, and then you say and you will deal with this in more detail later, in the last sentence of paragraph 9.  What the position was preceding yourappointment.      Right.  Is that a good thing, a bad thing?     So prior to 29 November 2016, for 22 months the office of the inspector general of intelligence was vacant.     And it is worth mentioning Chair, that at least some if not much of the evidence given, covers that period given by the state security agency witnesses.   MR    Paragraph 10 you have already told the Chair that your mandate is to conduct intelligence oversight on all statutory intelligence services, crimeintelligence of the South African Police Defence Intelligence of the South African National Defence Force and now the State Security Agency.  Is that correct?    Paragraph 11 you deal with Section 7 of the Oversight Act which sets out what you state in paragraph 11 to be your accountability and mandate.  76 says –  “The Inspector General shall be accountable to the committee for the overall functioningof his or her office and shall report on his or her activities and the performance of his or her functions to the committee at least once a year.”I take it that that committee is the Joint StandingCommittee of Intelligence?    And then 7A what does that provide? Section 7A.    Yes 77A.    Alright.  And those policies would –what are those policies? Just name one or other of them please?    Right. Internal policies.    So white paper?    What about the white paper wouldthat be a policy which you would monitor compliance with?    While we are on the white paper in your view what is the status of that white paper?  There hasbeen commentary by a number of witnesses who have to put it at its lowest different perspectives on the status of the white paper, what is your evidence in that regard?    Right.      What does 77C say?    Sorry Chair.    Section 77C of the Oversight Act what does that provide?    How do you interpret that in relation to your duties to investigate from an independent stand point?    And then sub-paragraph CA of Section 77 what does that provide?    And then sub-B of 77?    Right.  And the improper enrichment of any person through an act or omission of any member?    That would be a member of the Security Services?    And as I understand how you read the provisions of the act in relation to your independent oversight function that you may be requested or designatedto the function of conducting an investigation but in the conduct of the investigation that is your business as an independent oversight body?    And then sub-D what does thatprovide?    Yes and sub-E and sub-F.    Over the page.   And then sub-E and F over the page deal with your duty to submit reports to the JSCI to the Ministers that we have mentioned and in certain circumstances to the President.    Now all these reports and certificates are a matter of record.  They can be provided to the Chairbut depending on decisions concerning declassification they may not be able to be released to the public.    They will be submitted to the Chair indue course suitably redacted.  Then paragraph 12 – 12A is a reference to Section 7 (10) of the Oversight Act which enjoins you to comply with all security requirements applicable to employees of the agency.  Now that becomes relevant as you will detail later in relation to your own security classification, is that correct?    Security clearance.    And we will deal with that in duecourse.  And also some anomalies that arise out of that    Alright.  Now –    Yes we will get there.    Chair and then in relation to the manner in which the constitutional court has described the requisite independence of an oversight body you refer to the Glennister case it is referenced there if I can just read the last three or four sentences or lines of that paragraph where    Alright.  Has that prescript in your experience always been followed?    Alright. And then reference is made to the McBride case and the decision is referred to in paragraph 15 where you deal with the question of theindependence of IPID but are you saying to the Chair that similar principles apply in your case?    Particularly in regard to appointment and removal of the incumbent of the post.    And very importantly in paragraph 16 you note that in both Glennister and McBride the    You drafted this.    Legitimate expectations which is notmet in this case.    But these are your submissions?    And then in paragraph 17 you say   Right.  You trace some of the history of executive members relative to state security in paragraph 18 and following would you deal with those just briefly just name the officials please and say when they held office.    Right.  And in relation to the office of the IGI paragraph 22?    Alright.  And you make the remark in the last sentence at paragraph 22 that it has not been in the interest of the public that is so vital in oversight post has remained vacant for extended periods?    You confirm that.  Right then in – this is reasonably important in relation to the history of your engagement with the commission the provisions of Section 7(8) A and B of the Oversight Act  “Provide that the Inspector General shallhave access to any intelligence information or premises under the control of any of the intelligence services if such access to any intelligence information or premises is required by the Inspector General for the performance of his or her functions and he shall be entitled to demand from the Head of the service in question and its employees such intelligence information reports and explanations as the Inspector General maybe necessary for the performance of his or her functions.”And if we can just complete that before you answer any questions in that regard.  Paragraph 24 you refer to Section 7(9)“Access to intelligence information or premises contemplated in sub-section 8(a) may not be held – be withheld from the Inspector General on any ground.”Now we will deal towards the end of your evidence in relation to events that have happened in the past month or so subsequent to the testimony of the witnesses in January of this year before the commission.  But very briefly what is the import of these sections?    Right it is important that the information to which you are entitled in terms of the Act is that which you deem necessary not anybody else.    But it is also important that it is stated in two senses you are entitled to the information andnobody may refuse to give you that information as I understand the position on any ground.    And failure to comply with Section 7(8) that is in relation to your access to intelligence and premises and the like is an offence as you pointed out.    Right.  And then in paragraph 26 you mention one of the requirements which will become relevant later preceding the appointment of an Inspector General ofIntelligence what is that?    Right.  Now in paragraph 27 you deal with how you understand oversight and it may be a matter of controversy and is indeed a matter of controversy but how do you interpret and apply the legislative framework which provides for you oversight function?    In paragraph 28 you state what the provisions are that govern the intelligent services as well as the office of the IGI and you mentioned the constitution and the oversight act.  You also mention policy documents whichcontain checks and balances which include the white paper on intelligence and the minimum information security standards.  The missed document to which the Chair referred earlier and other aspects of the regulatory framework regulations directives, policies and standard operating procedures all those constitute the governing framework of the Intelligence Agencies, am I correct?    Right in the case of the SSA the lack of effective checks and balances was listed as one of thecardinal reasons for the alleged malfeasance corruption and fraud perpetrated at SSA.  That is your statement in paragraph 29.    And that state of affairs apparentlyled to the establishment of the high level review panel chaired by Dr Mufamadi which we have spoken about here and we will speak more about in due course but evidence has been led in that regard.  Is that correct?    And we will deal in due course with the findings of not only that but also of two preceding inquiries.  Can you name those, please?     Ja, we will deal with it in due course.     NESU ...[intervenes]      And the second one was a panel that sat during 2006.  Am I correct?    Alright.     Right.  And they made very clear findings in regard to the Office of the Inspector General Intelligence and in particular its independent function.     And we will highlight those in due course, Chair.     Paragraph 30.  What was the question?  You can read it if you wish to the Chair that was posed by the High Level Review Panel?    ...request.     And the questions may come sooner than the next generation.     And then in paragraph 31, what isyour contention in this regard?     ...quite generally stated.     Yes, you say in paragraph 31 thathad the OIPI been sufficiently strengthened.  What would you say to the proposition that it had all the powers, it had access to premises, it had access to documentation?  No one could refuse that.  How did it occur?  We will get to it in more detail but perhaps you can begin to address the question.  How could it happen that what appears to be a vast amount of fraud and corruption occurred ...[intervenes]      ...Security Agency.    Yes.  Issues of the strength of the Office of the IGI, which you have mentioned in paragraph 31, its independence and its capacity to function effectively, you deal with in the following paragraphs butan illustrative example is your budget.  Who and how is your budget determined?  Who determines your budget?  How is it determined?     But the point about that is that the very body and office over which you have oversight, the SSA, is the very body whom you have to deal with in obtaining your budget.  Is that correct?    Alright.  And just so that the point is not lost then.  We were talking about it earlier.  You monitor the SSA and call the SSA to account?     Is it appropriate in your view that that instance which you have the duty to monitor has a hand in determining your budget?     Right.  And then you raised another point in relation to the budgetary situation.  What do Crime Intelligence and Defence Intelligence think about your relationship with the SSA in relation to your budget?     Just one questions, if I may.     So that we do not overlook it  I might overlook it Chair.     It is correct that your information, your digital information is on the server of the SSA?     Is that appropriate?     In the context of the independence of the Inspector General of Intelligence and his or her office we are dealing with two aspects in your statement. The first is issues of the structure of the office, the context within which it operates in certain administrative matters like the budget and other operational matters.  We will get in a moment to the conduct of the SSA in your experience, that is a separate and second issue affecting the independence of the OIGI. In paragraph 32 to summarise it aptly, I think, would you care to read that paragraph onto the record?     Then in paragraphs 33 to 35 you deal with the classification of the office of the Inspector General of Intelligence in terms of the Public Service Act and in summary, and we need not go into detail, in summary what you are arguing for here is that the office of the Inspector General of Intelligence should not fall within the SSA administratively or operationally, it should be a separate entity in terms of the Public Service Act.  Do Iunderstand your argument correctly?     So as I understand what you say and of course there may be other explanations or excuses or whatever, the SSA does not say to you you can have your own server, it says use our server.     Right.  And then in paragraph 35, second sentence, you make the point that we mentionedjust before the short adjournment where you say in reality, however, the SSA and its Director General in particular holds the administrative power and the purse strings over the OIGI, its own oversight body.     That is the resultant outcome of the structure that you operated under, is that correct?     Then you say in paragraph 36    Well, what do you say, what is yourdescription of those events which have led you to that conclusion in paragraph 36?     Alright, so you worked with the Director General of the SSA Arthur Fraser during a period of your incumbency of the office of the IGI, is that correct?     And what you are going to tell the Chair later is what your opinion is of the elements of that relationship which you experienced.     Right.  Let us go then to paragraph 38 and deal with the filling of vacant posts in the OIGI.  Who has that power as you understand the position?     The Minister or the Director General?     Alright, because you say inparagraph 38 – then you could explain this because it seems somewhat different to what you have just said now.      Well, let us try and summarise the next section then.     How important were these posts?     Critical posts.     Yes.     Alright, what was the response?     Yes and we will come to that laterin relation to certain events that happened during your watch as IGI.  But you made an approach to Mr Fraser in order to release funds to fill those six critical posts.  What was his response?     Right, you make that point as to the applicability of the strategy development plan to your office later on but what do you say about Section 7.12 of the Oversight Act in paragraph 41?     So you refer to the power or duty to determine the needs of your office and the personnel necessary to discharge its mandate.  Who in the first instance should decide there in your view?     And does the – in your view …[intervenes]     Right.  Does the Director General of the SSA in your opinion and on your understanding of the law have any power or authority over the process of appointment of employees and the substantive decisions in relation to that appointment process?     Right.  And then you make the point in paragraph 43 in relation to the strategic development plan which was cited by Mr Fraser as being a reason not to or to delay the appointment, not to appoint or to delay the appointments that you required.  Is it correctthat you, as the office of the Inspector General have your own Vision 2022, as you referred to it?     Are you – is your office in any way subordinated to the strategy development plan of the SSA?     Right and you …[intervenes]     Right.  And let us put it at its mildest, you use strong language here but in your view is it appropriate that the head of an Intelligence service over which you have oversight and service which must account to you to determine how you should recruit staff or when you should recruit staff?     Okay.     And how does it affect yourindependence?       And you say in paragraph 44 by     Is that your view?     In this context the independence of the office of the IGI is confirmed and guaranteed in termsof the legislation, the governing legislative framework, in fact including the Constitution, correct?     The question may arise and it is illustrative of a view that notwithstanding the existence ofan oversight body, there are matters that are so sensitive that secrecy must be preserved at all costs.  In other words, there are some documents that you should not have, there are some things that you should not know, that should not get into any private hands.  What do you say about that?     Well, there may be a view, it has not been expressed as such but almost as such that thereare certain matters that fall within State Security that are so sensitive that they should remain secret at all cost and should never be revealed outside the purview of the SSA and that follows that you should not have access to certain information.     Yes.  You have referred to the provisions of the Oversight Act which say very clearly that you must access to all information premises and the like and it cannot be refused on any grounds provided it is within – it is deemed by you to be part of your function.     Have those provisions been followed uniformly and consistently in your experience?    Right and paragraphs 45 to 48 you deal with the budgetary issues.  We have dealt with those in questions and answers today already.  Do you need to expand anything there?  Can we move on?     Right.  You have under the head Recommendations made certain comments in paragraph49, would you share those with the Chair please?     In paragraph 49?     Now is this the first time that these issues have been canvassed or deliberated on?     To assist you we have extracted asummary, it is in a declassified document which deals with the two reports, the 2006 report and the Matthews report.  If I may, Chair, these do have reference numbers, they are in another file.     But for the sake of convenience we have extracted them now.     For the record however, Chair, they are in bundle YY2 at page 32.31 to 32.40 and we will referto those page numbers.  If we could go please to page 32.136.     You will see there at paragraph 13.2.2 this document deals with the Inspector General forIntelligence and it is an extract from the report of the high     It goes on to say    And then it refers to the 2008 Matthews Commission Report, which agreed with the     But let us leave that aside at the moment that appears to have been some of the focus of the high level review panel. But the recommendations of the 2006 panel and the Matthews Commission in 2008, have they ever been implemented?     While we here it is relevance will become clear later, in relation to the withdrawal of your security clearance.  The conclusion of the panel, that is a high level review panel is – or the non-conclusion is on page 032.138.  The last sentence of the first paragraph     Yes, and in relation to the original report, 15 years down the line.     Sure.      I have no power in that regard.      Right, and then certainly in respect of the Matthews Commission Report, that finding that we have just quoted was endorsed, although the high level review panel shows in what respects the two reports differed, that finding that the Inspector General's office should be given independent status is common to both reports, am I correct?    HLRP, well what he said on page - because I am not I think the - as I read the report of the high level review panel, there were somewhat equivocal onthe findings of the two previous panels but I do not want you to debate those they are here in black and white.  But they do make the point on page 032.139 of Y2, that over a     It is the first paragraph on page 032.139 of the document of the high level review panel thatI have just put in front of you.      So you go to page 032.139 on top     Yes, and of course - and in any event, we know that even since then, the independence of the OIGI has not been secured, as recommended by those, well two or three, those entities.     Alright, if we could go a little further and deal with the high level review panel report under this heading.  In the second paragraph on page 032.139 the panel, that is the high level review panel     Then the penultimate paragraph on that page foreshadows a question that you will deal with in    Well if you are asking my opinion I will be honest Chair ...[intervenes]    Or I won’t be deferential.    Well there are just one or two issues I would like to deal with that shouldn’t take very long, and then my view, but I am subject to your direction Chair, I am capable of going till nine.     My quickest close-off Chair, I thinkthat last consideration is perhaps decisive.        I did.     Yes.    Yes, the document which is the extract from the high level review panel at page YY232.139 does mention in the paragraph we have just referred to the status of the findings and the panel says in the last    So there would have been an internal panel report and there would have been an IGI report on the principal agent network, am I correct?    Alright now that report have you seen that report?    Right, and it would be within your province to give it to the Chair or not?     Yes, now what I wanted to ask to whom would such a report go in the ordinary course.  Do you know to whom the report went?       To whom did it go?    Several ministers.  Can you recall which ministers?      Right, well perhaps you could helpus in that regard.  Would the former president have been briefed?      Alright, do not give an answer that you cannot substantiate later.     Then just finally in relation to this document, at the bottom of the page the high level review    And then halfway down, there are anumber of bullets.  I am not going to read them all.     Right, and then at the bottom of    Okay, and then finally our team has produced a document on the status and source of the MIST document, the minimum information security standards.   The source is the public service regulations published or promulgated in terms of the Public Services Act of 1994. Chapter 5 of those regulations deals with electronic government regulations.  Part 2 of Chapter 5 deals with information security and Part B of Part 2 deals with theminimum information security standards, and there is a section which obliges the minister in consultation with the Minister of Intelligence to issue minimum information security standards for the public service in the form of a hand book. That was adopted by cabinet on 4 December 2996.  So in summary it is a standard for minimum information security measures that any institution must put in place for sensitive or classified information in order to protect national security and its source is in regulation and is therefore binding. Chair, if I can just hand that up.  We will include it in the bundle in due course.     We will provide it Chair.     We will provide that we put it in the bundle Chair.     It is available on the internet.     Yes Chair.      Chair, I am informed that the MIST document is in the legal framework document that you have.  It is at tab 3.    Yes Chair.  
ADV RAMOGALE:   Good afternoon Chair, my name is Tshidiso Ramogale, I appear on behalf of Lt General Peter Jacobs.     And we have brought the application that the Chairperson is referring to, and I am not sure by way of procedure whether you would want us to move the application and to provide our reasons for why the application is late, but we are in the Chairperson’s hands.     Well Chairperson our view is that the application need not be heard today.     The – provided of course that the relevant parts of the application which we have brought, in essence an application to strike out certain paragraphs from Dr Dintwe’s ...[intervenes]      The grounds are irrelevance.    Yes, no Chairperson that is correct that this is an inquiry but we are entitled if the Commission is being drawn to facts that are not within its purview.     To be objecting as such.    Well no Chairperson the argument we make is the test as the Chairperson is well aware of is oneof prejudice and the scope of prejudice is quite wide, it is not necessarily that a person has to be directly adversely affected by the allegations and what we say is that the allegations made in the affidavit are in fact damning before we even make our submissions on whether they are true or not we say that they are irrelevant to the Commission’s mandate.     We got the notice on the 29 t h of March,we set out our reasons, I appreciate that the Chairperson has not read the affidavit.     Yes, yes.     So we set out our reasons whenGeneral Jacobs was implicated, because he was implicated in his official capacity as Divisional Commissioner, we had to make an application for funding from the National Commissioner.     And that is what held us back, that is the first reason.  The second reason we have advanced is that the time General Jacobs was away on annual, on paid leave, and he couldn’t cancel and ...[intervenes]      On annual leave, the arrangements had already been made and he had already paid for the trip with his family.     No Chairperson, I will go to the other reasons.   When it became clear that he would not be able to submit his affidavit within fourteen days we made a request to the Commission, we wrote a letter to the Commission’s Secretary and we were informed that the Commission is not in a position to grant or deny applications and that the application would have to be moved with you.     No that is it, the only – we give a full answer to the allegations but the only grounds on which we bring this ...[indistinct] is that we say that they areirrelevant.     Chairperson might understand that application has been denied, our application to ...[indistinct]      Oh well we have provided our reason, I just wanted to be clear for the record that our application has been denied.     The added application that we have brought Chair is to – as I understand the rules require us to bring an application for leave to produce evidence which we have done in the same application.     We have done it in the same application.     Yes Chair.   The only thing I wish to point the Chairperson to is that there is no specific prayer in our Notice of Motion for leave and at the appropriatetime I will move the application.     In addition to that yes.     No, no we reserve our right in that respect depending on what the testimony is.    But it is a threefold application, condonation for the late filing, an application to strike out as well as an application for leave to give evidence.     Sorry Chair, I am a little bit confused now, so is there no decision on the application or ...[intervenes]      No I understand, thank you very much for your time. 
DR DINTWE:   Setlhomamaru Isaac Dintwe.     No.      Yes.     Yes.    So help me God.    I do have.     I can see that.      That is correct Chair.     I am on that page.       I confirm it is my signature.     I can certify that.     That is correct, I can confirm that Chairperson.     That is correct Chairman.     That is correct Chairperson.     With effect from the 15 t h of March 2017.     The Intelligence Services Act and the Oversight Act Number 40 of 1994. ADV PRETORIUS     I am aware of that Chairperson, I do confirm but I will only be dealing with some of the other evidence that was not adduced.     Yes, but Section 210 you know want to cover the whole of the Security apparatus of the country and will go beyond the State Security Agency to also cover Crime Intelligence which is a division of the South AfricanPolice Services, it will also cover the Defence Intelligence which is just a division in the South African National Defence Force.       That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct.       That is correct Chairperson.       That is correct.     That is correct Chairperson.     I will also deal with that Chairperson.     Alright, now Chairperson I have to be careful here because there is a thin line between the two processes that I am going to explain here.  The first one is the provisions of Section 78 which talks about before any disclosure, to any institution or organisation outside of IGI I am required to consult with the State President and theysay relevant Minister, so if it is the information which only deals with the State Security Agency it will be only that Minister but in this instance, because I am dealing with information which cover across the three different intelligence services I had to consult with fourfunctionaries, which will be the State President and the three Ministers; Minister of Police, Minister of Defence and Military Deterrence as well as Minister of State Security.Now once that process is concluded then we get to the other one which then deals with the declassification of information and I do get my powers to declassify from the Minimum Information Security Standard or the MISS document, which then says that the documents can be classified, reclassified or declassified by the originator, in other words the author or the owner of those documents.  So in the Office of Inspector General of Intelligence you will get different documents, you will get those that I would have produced as the Inspector General of Intelligence but you will also get those that I would have requested from different services, so which means that then I cannot declassify those, but I can declassify only those that I have ownership of.     Yes, the position of our office and I think the other stakeholders that I would have discussed this is that in fact it is a binding document.     It is a binding document.     Ja, it started off as a cabinet resolution or a cabinet decision and then it was used across government because there could be some information that needs to be classified and that does not necessarily belong to the Intelligent Services, even the Cabinet Ministers themselves they are classified so this will be a reference document, but what enhanced its powers or what made it morestronger was the decision of Justice Museneke on the matter of Ms Papier, on Ms Papier ’s decision and since after that the Constitutional Court developed some guidelines and those guidelines were based on the provisions of MISS document, so from where I am sittingChairperson I will say that it is an enforceable document, it is also a binding document.     And perhaps Chairperson to say that debate is still ongoing.     Ja, there is such a debate and maybe what I was providing to you is the position of the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence because if it is ongoing then we also have a particular position.     And it is not surprising that as a person who monitors compliance I would like to have a particular framework which will assist me so that I can go to people and say that why did you classify this one, why didn’t you declassify this one when that information is required,especially for prosecution, so I think that we will have our own bias, if you like, as an oversight body.     To say that the way it is drafted it can at least take us somewhere in an absence of another legalframework ...[indistinct] with classification/declassification as well reclassification, so the debate is ongoing.   In fact we have some minutes somewhere which also reflect that we have been meeting with the ...[indistinct] and really dealing with these issues.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    It is 77A.    It talks about the monitoring of compliance by any service with the constitution applicable laws and relevant policies on intelligence and counter-intelligence.    It includes their own policies and in this instance one can mention what they called the MTD’s.    Ja even that your own internal policies yes.    It could be – it could be a policy of recruitment for instance.    That is correct Chairperson we can also monitor compliance with that.    My evidence is that the legislation including the constitution mirrors exactly what is contained in the – in the white paper.  In fact any deviation from that will be problematic because it was a policy document where they sat down and they said that this is how we want you know Intelligence Services to be configured and these are the powers that we will like.  So all those other piece oflegislation such as the Strategic Intelligence Act such as the Intelligence Services Act much as the Oversight Act itself are sort of your coming out – out of the white paper.  So our    Our position and maybe my submission also to the high level review panel was to say that it should not youknow belong to the dustbin of history especially in instances where you will have a lacuna – a lacuna in the current legislation.  For instance one of the biggest issues that happened was the amalgamation of the then National Intelligence Agency and the then SASS – South African Secret Services and it just happened by a proclamation.  So the current Strategic Intelligence Act may not have been sufficient to deal with the how those different services could be amalgamated or even disentangled as the – intending to do it now.  That is my position Chairperson it is not a legalargument.    Yes.    It sees that I shall also perform all functions designated to me by the President or any Minister responsible for a service.    We are calling them a task team.  So which means that the Minister will for instance have a seriousproblem with let us say absenteeism in one of the agencies and she may just decide to say that the Inspector General because you have got the investigative powers please investigate this particular matter.  But it is not like they really supervise me instruct and supervise me.  I think that is when you are struggling to draw a difference and the Ministers are also struggling to draw a difference.  They think that to – for me to perform designated functions it is like they can you know just tell me what to do and supervise me throughout there.  So the outcome here will be anindependent outcome and unfortunately if the President likes it or if he does not like it is something else.    I then receive an investigate complaints frommembers of the public and members of the services.  In other words there are three services that he has mentioned earlier.  On the following alleged maladministration, abuse of power, transgressions of the constitution, laws and policies referred to in paragraph A.    Oh then – I am sorry about that I see that I left out a very important part there which deals with also investigating any contraventions of the Prevention And Combating Of Corrupt Activities Act.   That is correct.    But from the public as well very much important.    That is correct Chairperson.    Alright now all these functions which are contained in 77 it is – I normally summarise them to say more in.  We do monitoring.  We do review and then we also investigate complaints.  Now at the – at the end of the financial year they all culminate into what we will then call a certificate.  A certificate they use that word in the oversight act but it is more like an annual report where I then you know summarise I would have done monitoring there.  There are problemsthere.  There will be reviews.  There are problems there.  It will be investigation of complaints and so forth.  And then I submit that certificate firstly to the Ministers responsible Ministers and then I later go to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence to make a presentation on my findings and recommendations as they are contained in that.  It is normally a lengthy document around 60/70 pages or so.      Yes in terms of the Oversight Act they refer to it in under level C a certificate.    It is like an annual report but you raise a very important issue so I will have like a one pager.    We even you know print it in colours and so forth.    And in there I will say that I am – I express an opinion on whether anything done by the intelligence services was in contravention of the law and or the constitution or their own internal policies.  So I will write that but the certificate which is a one pager it is always accompanied by an annexure.  So we will call it an annexure.     But it will be a narrative report because in a one pager I will say that I am not satisfied with this and I am dealing with it in paragraph 18.   AB and C in the annexures.    But then we bind it.  So and you would have three.   Because we make one certificate per service.    That is correct.    I know that you do not want us to delete in a piece meal fashion but I have done that activity already because what I have done in terms of – they are my documents so I have got a lot of powers to really declassified.  What I have done is that I have redacted all the information which deals with organisational weaknesses which deals with their methods of the intelligence as well as the – what they call sources or informers if you like.  So Ihave already removed that kind of information because what I wanted to show the commission is only the transactions procurement and all those other issues.  So yes of course that they will be submitted.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    It is that the independence is guaranteed and it is you know even in the – in legislation so I think that as we go deeper into my evidence I will want to portray to thecommission how that independence has been you know undermined to an extent that one day will be asked a question where were you when things were getting so    Yes Chair.    And I 00   That is our submission Chairperson.    No not in all instances.    That is our submission Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    Ja but I – I did draft that.    Yes.  Chairperson yes independently so.    Alright Chairperson you may have asked me earlier my qualification is not a law degree.    I did what they called Bachelor of Criminal Justice.    That was my junior degree.    And then I ventured into like your forensicswhen I got to Masters so…    It had a lot of law modules.    Where eventfully understood of law.   These are my submissions.    That is also my submission that is correct Chairperson.    I will do that and I am going to be very briefChairperson in 1994 there was no Minister of State Security.  There were subordinated – they use that word – they were subordinated to the Minister of Justice so you will have this big Ministry of Justice and then you will have a Deputy Minister and at that time it was Minister the Late JoeNhlanhla who became the Deputy Minister of Justice but with responsibility of the Intelligence Affairs.In 2000 the Ministry was established and it was led by Ministers I will just mention a name and the years. Lindiwe Sisulu from 2000 to 2004 and it also had Minister Ronnie Kastrils from 2004 to 2008 followed by Minister Siyabonga Cwele 2008 to 2014 and then later Minister David Masobo from 2014 to 2017 and then also followed by Advocate Bongani Bongo who was there only until February    Ja we start this a little bit earlier in 2004 but there will be some other arrangements that happened before that I did not think that they will be so much relevant but one of my predecessors was Mr Zolani Nakane who was appointed as the IGI in 2004 and he remained in office untilDecember 2009.  The position was vacant from December 09 to April 2010 when the late Ambassador Faith Radebe took over and then she held that position for five years until    That is correct.    The import of that section I will see that it willbe twofold.  The first one is to ensure that the – this office is never ever denied any information.  In fact Chairperson they even make it a criminal offence to do that.  Because Intelligence Services by their own nature are secretive in nature and it is an acceptable principle worldwide.  So here they wanted this particular office which will have an unfettered access to intelligence because since we will get hidden.  But the second point there is that – alright the second point is that it shows that the Inspector General of Intelligence it says there may deem necessary for theperformance of his or her functions.  It was also in our view trying to you know prevent a situation that I was telling the Chairperson about earlier this year an instance where you will get the other functionary who will want to take the discretion as well as the powers of this particular office.  Soin other words I do have a right to even meet with the people from the commission, people from the Hawks if you like or even people from IPID and be able to deal with that information or the accessed information there.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is an offence that is correct Chairperson.    That is what they call a security clearance.  So you will be vetted. You will undergo this process of being vetted and the requirement there is that I should be cleared at a level of secret – top secret in fact.  In other words the –that provision means that I may be recommended by Parliament, get appointed by the President but if I fail this requirement I will not occupy the position of Inspector General of Intelligence.    Yes it remains a debatable issue in terms ofwhat oversight is and so forth and we also – I have those engagements with the first person that I worked on the affidavit – I mean here because he was saying that but the constitutional provision talks about monitoring of the Intelligence Services and my take – my position is that in fact the word oversight is all encompassing because it includes monitoring, it includes review, it also includes investigation of complaints.  The other people feel that the word monitoring and review may also be semantics we do not think so.  We think that monitoring can happensimultaneously with whatever so if – I want to make a – an example which is not controversial I think ja.    That is correct Chairperson.    I confirm that is my statement.    That is correct Chairperson.     There was what we call the NESU(?) report.  I would like you to – it is a long name – I would like you todirect me to these two paragraphs that ...[intervenes]      Yes ...[intervenes]      ...later Chairperson, ja.  It is a long name.  It is two different panels.     That is correct.     No, the first one was 2006.  The second one was 2008.     That is correct.     That is exactly Chairperson why I said ...[intervenes]      Oh, sorry.  That is exactly why I was saying that there could be questions by the next generation even     Oh, yes.  So my submission to the Commission followed – it was followed by a particular     My contention is ...[intervenes]      Okay.  My contention is that if the OIPI was strengthened, Chairperson, there was not even a need for the HLRP, of the high-level – what you call a multi-panel because then we would have been able, you know, deal with all that work.  I mean, if you look at what the Oversight Act says we can do, it is – I think it is a lot.  I mean, if we deal with the provincial of the andthe combating of the Corruption Activity Act.  If we deal with maladministration, abuse of power and all those other issues.  That is exactly the reasons that led to the establishment of the High-Level Review Panel.     The first ...[intervenes]      Oh, sorry, sorry.  The first basic reason will obviously be that after the term of tenure of Mr Ngcakani it remained vacant.  And after the period of Advocate Faith Radebe, it remained again vacant for 22-months.  But the strengthening, we will deal with that.  I think that what I can say at this stage is that and we are ...[indistinct]   There is a colleague of mine here who is accompanying me.  He will tell me if I should not tell – I should not disclose this.  But we are waiting nationally, Chairperson, and my staff compliment is only 34-people. We do not even have a satellite office, a provincial office whatsoever.  I do not think that that is a sign of strength of an institution which has to deal with such in cumbersome work of overseeing the Intelligence Service.     Lack of independence.     But also the vacancy.     There are vacancies that are not filled out of the 34, I am only sitting with 24-people.    Some of them are only doing administrative work.     And they are not really investigators.     We have done that many a times, Chairperson.     When I assumed my position I also developed what we call 20/22 Vision.  It was a five year strategy of the office.  And we came up with a structure that we then submitted together with what we call a Concept Document but in the Concept Document because we do not have legislative powers, legislations makingpowers, we were normally advised the ...[indistinct] Committee on Intelligence that we are sitting here and we have a practical experience of how this legislation works.  So we would have written to them.  I know the Legal Team always laughs this off – well, I mean not off, they really get surprised when I tell them that the Inspector General of Intelligence does not have the appointing powers.  The legislation phase, the Minister of State Security shall appoint people to the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence.    It has never happened since I got there.  People have gone all the time and some have resigned and so forth.  No one – there is no one, not even a single person who was appointed for the past four years that Iwas in this office, which makes perfect sense.  I mean if I was a Minister myself, I would not appoint people to go to an office which were to pestering(?) with me.  I mean, as an institution.     Chairperson, later I quote a paragraph from one of the letters from the Director General, from the representative of the SSA then ...[intervenes]      ...the former one.     And I address exactly that issue.  I take out in paragraph where he writes to me to say that we cannot fill those positions.     And what exhaust(?) the state of affairs is that there are funded positions at least even minimum.  So this would have been the people who would have left, went on retirement or resigned or got transferred, for instance. So even if you do not then change this branch of 34, at least let us deal with the funded positions.     The funded positions are there, the money will always be there.     Alright.  The Oversight Act says that the budget of the individuals shall be appropriated through thevote of the Ministry of State Security which is not a problem.  We do not have a problem with that because we do not necessarily to have a vote.  What we have a problem with is that there is no prior determination that is made before the money reaches the State Security Agency.  So it will only be after that, after they have received.  Let us say they give them a thousand rand.  Now I have to go there and back as if I am one of the Chief Directorates there.  They are calling(?) the other department to their directorate what they will say what our requirements or ourneeds are standing at about hundred-and-thirty rand, you know.  So I also come there.  And the Director General then determines whether he is going to give me what I have requested.  Chairperson, I was never ever given what I would have requested.  So there would be a particular baseline and they will always give me that money.       That is correct.     I was asked that question ...[intervenes]      ...you know by the committee when I was asked for their intervention.     And they at least understood initially.     Need to mean that I want to be given above all these other departments and that was not my contention.  Now this is how where we are at now.  In 16/2017, the Head of Corporate Services writes to the DG of SSA and say that you have been given us this budget but for 2016 and early 2017 we do not have an Inspector General.  So we will not be able to use that particular money.  So they only said that you - in themeantime just give us money so that we can pay for rent, lines(?), personnel costs and so forth.So the money was reduced at a particular point.  When I started in 2017, it was already the beginning of a new financial year and I nicely went back to them and said but this was the baseline.  So they would have removed a lot of money.  Now they wanted me to start again where they would have, you know, put that particular amount in other ways.I started with a budget which did not include theoperations of a fully functional office now because I had taken incumbency there.  And that has always been my argument.  My argument is never to say that I know that even SSA themselves their budget has been cut over and over again.  I think two consecutive years now.  All theother departments.  I understand all the pressures of the fiscals.  All what I am saying is that if my baseline was standing at thousand rand and somebody in my office, rightly so, came and said do not give me three thousand this year because I am not going to be able to – give me five hundred rand.  We can expect that then I start with five hundred and I start moving at a cost of about 4% or 5% because that is what they do just to cater for the personal expenditure and for the increment and so forth.  So you cannot expect meto do that.  To start there again and start building a new baseline.  That is my complaint.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Oh, no.  By the way, Chairperson.  Maybe I should have mentioned that we managed to get ring fencing.      Ja, that is done by Treasury.     Yes.     It is achieved.  The only problem is that it is done after the money has been given to the State Security Agency.     Ring fencing should happen on the otherside.     Because this model works perfectly ...[intervenes]      ...with the Public Protector who are giving the budget, I think, through Justice Constitutional Development.  We will have IEC who are getting from Home Affairs.  So they never really – and I think NP(?) also getting from somewhere.  But during the appropriation inParliament, they have already made a determination ...[intervenes]      ...that this amount ...[intervenes]      ...belongs to – ja, IP is a good example.       This amount belongs to IP.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Yes.     By SSA, yes.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.    It is not right at all because it undermines independence but again you are sitting with these peoplethat you are basically dependent on them.     Ja, let us call it a third-party tendons(?) Chairperson because I am sitting in the premises of the ministry administer.  I am sitting on the server of the agency and the complaint by some – the management of Crime Intelligence may not be current as well as theDefence.Is that in this instance we have a counterintelligence mandate to protect our own information.So you are sitting there on the ICT infrastructure of the SSA.  In other words, their beef is that SSA could have an upper hand in as far as the information is concerned because I call up the information, I go to my office but I am in the same premises.  I mean, they can open those premises.  They are providing security there and everything.  So that is the complaint as it comes fromthe other services, Intelligence Services.     That is correct, Chairperson.     No, it is not appropriate.     Yes, I mean, ja, I think the digital people will also tell you there is always – I mean, if I owe the infrastructure.     It is my infrastructure.     It does not even need like special skills.     I think that if you are looking it fromemployer ’s point of view is that always I will have a right to access the systems of other people.     Just to check a few things.     Yes.     I say there, Chairperson, that    You understand my argument correctly, Chairperson, I further submit that its form is unknown, that is the terms that they use that they will tell you that you do not know what is the situation, the statutory body is theconstitutional body inside a government department you will have national department, it is the provincial department and that is exactly what the Public Service Act does when we talk about the scheduling of different institutions of government.     That is correct and, Chairperson, each timeyou ask them – because I am Mafiki Zola, I only came yesterday, but there will be history, you know, attached to that.  So I kept on asking them which legal framework was used to put this office here and you never ever get that answer because the Oversight Act does not say anything about an administrative connection between the OIGI and any of the Intelligence services, not even the SSA itself.  So there is nothing in legislation which provides for that.     That is correct.    That is correct, Chairperson.     I am referring to Mr Arthur Fraser.     Correct, it will be a plethora of issues that actually came to the fore that I actually ended up in court trying to litigate and get an interdict against Mr Arthur Fraser.  So it is a plethora of them, I hope that maybe Adv Pretorius will be able to gloss through them as we go into this.  May I also remark, Chairperson, if you allow me to say that when I was working on this affidavit I had adiscussion and I said that it should not sound as a personal grievance.  So every time I talk about these issues I was trying to show how they defeat the principle of independence other than dealing with myself as a person at a particular point.  In other words, this can also beapplicable to any other identification 06.37 at any given time.  So I had that discussion I think with the legal team here also to say that I just do not know how to produce these issues or to show the Commission that I am talking about the whole office is defeated, not a person or even any office employees.     That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, I will be doing that, Chairperson.     It is the Minister of State Security in consultation with the OIGI.    The Minister, the oversight act is the Minister.     I can qualify it.  I am not even rectifying it, that was intended statement.  Any Minister will have whatthey call a political oversight over these institutions so in an ideal world they do not get to involve themselves on issues of budget, on issues of operations and all those other issues.  So, by extension, although the legislation says that the Minister shall appoint, when I make appointments, the person who is sitting with the money is the accounting officer who is the Director General of the SSA and it is a well-known fact.  That is how the communication will go.  I will talk to the Minister and say the Minister – if it ever happens, it has never happened,unfortunately, but I will say Minister, there are two vacant positions which are critical.  For instance, I do not have an office manager, I need to run my own office., I need to run my own office, I never had a PA for a very long time, I got somebody somewhere in the office to do that and thenimmediately after communicating that, the Minister may write to the Director General and say that please the deal with this.  But the ultimate power of releasing the money, of conducting interviews and so forth resides with the accounting officer.  The Minister may sign as a final signatory on the submission that appoints those people.So that is why I am saying that although you talk to the Minister but the Director General had more power, in fact even more than the Minister had in terms of making those decisions.    That is the proposition that I am making.    Ja.  Now that is good example of then who is holding the strings.  I do not know the word power, maybe we are using it both sides but who is holding the strings.  So in November 2017 I wrote a letter to the Director General so I would have spoken to Minister Mahlobo who said that in principle I do not have a problemso please tell us – give us like the list of the positions that you want filled and then I wrote a letter to the Director General and Mr Arthur Fraser and I informed him about my intention to commence with the recruitment drive.  In other words asking him to facilitate that process.Although those posts were funded, I still required Mr Fraser to release the funds in order to fill the post.  Now they will explain that the CFO – the Chief Financial Officer will explain that the money sits somewhere because the only money that the release will be for warm bodies. So as and when the position remains vacant, the money will be somewhere but it will not be readily available.   So there is only – it was not even asking for permission to do that because I know that the permission was to be sought from the Minister.  I was informing himthat I am starting, may you please release those funds.     Critical posts, I can remember them from the top my head, one of those is what we call OPO.  Now OPO is Oversight Principal Officer, they are sitting in my Exco because they are component heads of different structures in the OIGI.  So you will have an OPO who is sitting here who is only responsible from Crime Intelligence, you will have the other one who is responsible for the domestic branch of the SSA, the other one for thefallen branch of the SSA, the other one for the defence.  So these are senior people reporting directly to myself.     And [indistinct – dropping voice]     Can I also mention maybe the IT specialist like in my office?  And the majority of the complaints that I am getting I mention because the majority of the complaint that I am getting will be like I think that I am being intercepted unlawfully, I do not where is that cameracoming from because it is starting to sound like one and for me, I cannot depend then on the SSA to see that let us check your systems if you have this particular person.  I need to have somebody who will have the powers vestedon him by the OIGI so that particular – so that is the second post [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]      Oh, alright, alright.  You know unfortunately I have to then refer to the conditions of service because the condition of service are determined by the President and the joint standing committee of Intelligence.  So youhave a document where you write – all my conditions of service are packed at a level of a Deputy Minister.     And I think that it makes sense because I am overseeing Director Generals.     Ja, with SAPS it will be a lower rank, Lieutenant General.     [indistinct] it will be also be a LieutenantGeneral.     But SSA, it is a full DG.     May I please read it to the Chairperson, it is     Nothing at all, Chairperson.  But this is mywork and this is a letter that is there.     Where this guy say no, no, no, no, wait, you have got your own strategic what what, you are reporting somewhere but I will not be giving you that money until Iam done with my own restructuring.     I am saying that there is a serious misconception of that particular section because that Section empowers the Minister and I have t correct this, Chairperson, I would have said in consultations – not in consultation with myself, the appointment by the Minister,it is after, that is what the Act says.  It is a fine line also.  But there was a misconception because Section 7.12 of the Oversight Act empower the Minister after consultation with the Inspector General to appoint such number of employees to the OIGI as may be necessary for the performance of the function of that office and that is basically my emphasis.  But again we are trying to draw that distinction I think that we talked about to say that who is holding the power and who is holding the real power in this particular instance?    It is the Inspector General, the [indistinct] who have to decide on that.     Because – oh, sorry, sorry, Advocate, because there is rather there which says that as maybe necessary for the performance or the functions of that office.  Now the Minister is supposedly sitting somewhere.     Exactly, I am the one who knows that.    But that provision also does not say that she has to make that determination it only says that will appoint after consultation with myself.     Not at all, Chairperson.    That is correct, Honourable Chair.     Not at all, it does not even affect the members who are sitting in the OIGI.  Even if there is a restructuring they will never ever come closer to them.     Because they are not even appointed interms of the same legislation.  Staff in my office are appointed in terms of the Oversight Act where as they use Intelligence Services Act to appoint members of the SSA.     I prefer to call it irrational.    Not in the legal sense but [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes because I cannot find a reason, I cannot fathom the reason that is why I am saying that it is unreasonable.     It is wrong for all reasons.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is my view.     That is correct.     I will request, Chairperson, that the question be repeated, I think I missed something.     Yes, we have several examples to show that even written letters to the effect that you cannot have information with regard to this particular issue.  So yes, of course, there will be that continuous resistance.  They are very clever, we call it managed access because they knowit is a criminal offence.  So you will request this document three times and by the fourth time when you want to cross the street and go to Garsfontein police station they will give that document to yourself.  That will be after manyattempts so it defeats the efficiency of this office.  So yes, of course.     That is correct, Chairperson.     No, not at all.  Not in all cases, that is what I wanted to say.     No, not really, I think, Chairperson, I have made I think my point there.     Yes, I am making recommendations to say that there are problems with the oversight, Oversight Act and the previous JSCI as the current one asked me previously to say that I should share with them what I thinkneed to be dealt with.  But there was another process that was taking place in parliament to address two issues as issues with regard to all oversight bodies.   The first one was the funding because almost everyone in the oversight was not happy about the funding, to say that how do they remove it from the administrative department so that there are not problems.  But the second one was - we were informed that there is committee, that they used the word ploughing, that is ploughing through all the legislations and an explanationthat was given was that the researchers in parliament realised that some of the acts of parliament were passed like in a rush [indistinct], so they said that a lot of them needed to be revisited.The recommendations that I am making there are with regard to the oversight, the Oversight Act and I am making two distinct ones there if you will allow me to continue.     49.1 and 49.2, yes.  49.1 I say    Not really.  In fact, Chairperson, I think you will be surprised to hear that the high level review on – I mean panel, just quoted those recommendations which were made by the two panels that were established.  Can I go through them?  The first one is at 2006, I must just see where they are.     Yes.     Yes.     I see that; I confirm that Chairperson.    Yes.     They have never been implemented Chairperson I think I need to mention that there is a letterin my possession which showed that during the tenure of Minister Kasrils that letter was written to the then Minister of Public Service, the former Minister Geraldine Fraser- Moleketi and in principle, she had responded saying that, yes, of course the request made by Minister Kasrils makesense. So she wanted to establish a work stream, they called it that was going to deal with the whole process and take it further, but then it died a natural death.      It has not been implemented and maybe I should remark here before it slips my mind to say that this is a document which was declassified by the President, andit was then it was made a public I mean it was then turned into - I do not know if, to call it an instruction.  So the high level, the HLRP reports, this one here, can no longer be seen as mere recommendations, because the President says, get a team together and implement these recommendations as they are but yes, of course, all those recommendations are not yet implemented two years down the line.     Yes, but Chairperson may I please also mention this, and you will bear with me?      I know that I could be seen as arrogant in that, you are supposed to leading me.     Alright, thank you very much.  The recommendation of the President in terms of the Constitution, could have a binding effect and become enforceable, even if it is a policy and that is in terms of Section 85, sub-section 2, I think it is B, which says that the top part will say that the President may develop a national policy in conjunction with the members of his cabinet.  But sub-paragraph B talks something about theenforceability of such a policy.  Maybe that could really assist our position in terms of that myth as well but I did not want to take it further than that.     It is actually three, not even both, the 2006 08 as well as the HLRP.     I am sorry Chairperson I did not get the paragraph there.      Okay, I am there yes.     Yes, I can see that.     Yes, I agree with that statement and maybe one needs to also remark that the institutions ofgovernment are destroyed by the government.  I do not know if it is herself or himself but you have got this very, very, very good concept of how oversights should be conducted and so forth but then you frustrate this organisation. Even before my arrival. I like this report, because it takes it back before my arrival. So you can see that my predecessors were also contending with the same issues and it brings you to your knees, to be honest.  I mean, if you are not given the money and so forth, you come there,you are excited, you say I am going to serve the country, I am going to assist them.  But Chairperson, I am there for four years and I do not think that I am going to wait any day longer when this term comes to an end, I am just trying to survive, because you come there with your skills andwhat happens.  I mean, you can see that my predecessors including myself have failed to turn around this oversight structure.  That is how frustrating it is.     Yes, that is correct, it was expressed by the panel.     Thank you very much.  Chairperson, if I started earlier it would be just to say that no one and no one in the intelligence where I play an oversight role should come and mislead you by saying that we are not aware.  The certificates are comprehensive documents, which deals with even a transaction worth about R60, 00 or 70 if it did not happen in accordance with our prescripts, so I do that.  So I would have included that, I would have included all the information and this is how the certificatestravels.  I sent first to all three Ministers and I solicit inputs, obviously those inputs are also not even legislated but it is a novel thing that I introduced when I got there but they have got an opportunity to convince me otherwise.  So I will then incorporate those, that I think that they have a point and then I will finalise the certificate and then I will send to the Ministers again. We have been doing it religiously, we have got records of that, we have got covering letters and then I will go and present to the committee as well, religiously doing that, so no one shouldever claim that we are not aware and I think that the high level panel is also confirming that, saying that although they say that they lacked independent but you have seen their reports and those reports are instrumental in using them ...[indistinct], because oversight should not replace the internal controls, that cannot, I cannot run the SSA, I cannot run Crime Intelligence, what I can do is to point them to this ...[indistinct] as well as you know look both in the internal controls and what I am responsible to oversee is as to whether they develop internal controls and whetherthey implement that. And I think OUTA General will also be doing the same principle follow the same principle, to say there is a problem here, deal with it, whether you charge the person or whatever, so that is what the HLRP Chairperson is alsoconfirming to say that but there are reports there which are comprehensive enough.     I have that evidence to show that there’s continuity in that office, there is continuity because the rest of the staff members are appointed permanently.     So when I got into that office there was something that they didn’t bring 2015/2016 financial year and even before that, I have – I have had an opportunity to also engage with those certificates you know when I was ...[indistinct] I acclimatised myself with that office, verymuch comprehensive, hard-hitting, show you exactly where the problems are.     I know where the problem is Chairperson, if you will allow me.     And something which is not insurmountable.   It is because you have got a body such as ours and you only give them the power of recommendation.  We have a position and I was thinking that maybe that could be like alegacy project; to take myself to court and argue that I don’t think that recommendations can just be ignored.  I know that the answer is going to be that they are not remedial, they are not remedial measures, but I don’t think that any government in its right mind will throw money into this particular organisation and this organisation only keeps on doing recommendations which are ignored you know at such a shoe space and nothing happens, so there is no power of recourse, and because I always keep evidence that I would have elevated this matter to the nextlevel whether it is committee most of the times, I sometimes even go to the President, I have gone to the previous President, I have gone to the current President and made them aware of things that are happening in Intelligence Services, so this thing of recommendationversus remedial measures I think that it creates serious problems.     Yes it was most.     Yes.    Ja, I will make a presentation Chairperson.    A presentation.     Yes, yes.     It is an ad hoc arrangement because thelegislation does not put him in the scheme of things as ...[indistinct] are concerned, its status are sent to the ministers who shall cause them to be sent to the Committee on Intelligence.     But if you look at the definition of a Minister Advocate Pretorius on the Oversight Act it says the Minister shall refer to the State President or any other member of cabinet appointed in terms of I think Section 189 and so forth, so it is an ad hoc thing in fact that would be my answer.   I have done it once unfortunately with the current President and only once with the former President.     Not the previous committee and with the current committee I will be honest with you, the time that I have worked with them is not sufficient for me to create apattern or to make an opinion, to be honest they seem very much eager you know to follow these, I have never ever had a member of parliament telling me to slow down a little bit because the environment is too complex, and it is an environment where you deal with different piece oflegislation and so forth, so I will not be able – but the previous I don’t remember getting anything significant that they would have done to assist, but I keep on elevating to them and making them aware of these challenges.     That is correct, it was ...[intervenes]      Oh Chairperson, sorry about that.    That is correct Chairperson.     Yes, I have seen that report.     Yes, we are the ones who produce thatreport ja.     No I know where it went after I have done alot of work on that, I was briefed fully on that because ...[intervenes]      Yes, but this is how it started, how it started is very important.   It was a ministerial task in terms of the Oversight Act.  Siyabonga Twele after the SSA had concluded its own report and they went to the then Minister of Justice and the Minister of Justice said oh, there is a lot of you know criminality in this particular report.  Please sent it to the SIU at that particular point and I think theHawks if I am not mistaken, it could have been Scorpions, I am not sure. But he then wrote a letter to the OIGI, giving them terms of reference.  So he wanted them to investigate some other things.  So the planned report which belongs or which was produced by the OIGI will be confined to specific issues which were in the terms of reference. That is the reason why because the Act then forces the IGI to report back for the tasking authority.  If it is the president you go back, if it is the minister you go back.  Sothere were several presentation that were made to the, for all the ministers, to several ministers. 
SETLHOMAMARU ISAAC DINTWE:  [d.s.s] 
MR DINTWE:  It is not a classified document.  This is notclassified.     That is correct Chairperson.    I see that Chairperson.    I confirm that Chairperson.    That is the correct arrangement with the legal team Chairperson.    That is my understanding also Chairperson.    I can confirm that we have completed that process Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.  There is aletter from the president confirming that.     That is correct Chairperson, that is our understanding and interpretation of the OIG.    Not at all Chairperson.  It was a very difficult one.  There were letters in fact that would have been written to the commission which could indicate to the commission that it was a to and fro kind of process.     Alright.  Now the complaint came at the time that I was expecting their inputs because the way theconsultation was done, is that I provided the three ministers and the president with the bundle, full bundle and say that I am intending to disclose this information to the commission and I am trying to comply with 7(8)A and B. Now those documents were gone for about twoweeks or three weeks, and there was an agreement because we were under pressure of time, a serious one and the president directed a particular date.  On that date instead of me getting the inputs, I then received three bound documents. They were under the cover of a letter from the president.  The president was informing me that he received complaints from the three ministers.  Now Minister Bheki Cele would have written his own complaint.  Minister Nosiwe Mabisang Mapula would have written hers andMinister Yanda Dlodlo would have written hers as well. But there was a serious commonality between them.  Complaint number one was that I disclosed information to the commission before I consulted, and the recommendation that they were making to the president was that I should be suspended, and obviously be removed from this position on the basis of incompetence I think they were referring to that. But I received it on the day that I was expecting the inputs.    Yes, there were three complaints.   That is correct.  Maybe I should not have said complaints.  I should have said there were three documents.     With three different authors, but the content ... ja, the allegations made against me was similar.    Yes.     Yes Chairperson, but maybe I should have told you that they were in one document they were four, in the other one they were three.  Like in the annexures youwill see, so it will be three different allegations ...[intervenes]     Coming from Minister Bheki Cele for instance.     But complaint number one will be the disclosure to this commission.    I do not mind mentioning the other two.    That were also common.    Ja, I do not think they are relevant here.     Yes.     That is correct Chairperson.    He was informing me that he received those complaints, that he was attaching them and that he referred that complaint to the joint state committee on intelligence, and that he hopes that they will give me audi and with regard to the issue of suspension, he said that it will depend on the recommendation of the committee, the JSCI.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.     That is correct.  I went, I was called.     When I was starting to explain to them andmy starting point, my opening point was to say that if this is an inquiry in terms of the Oversight Act, I think that you should have informed me in the letter so that I can also seek legal representation or, and then they told me that no, no, no we decided not to start an inquiry in terms of this particular issue. In fact, they also informed me that they missed sending me a letter that they sent back to the president.  So they would have responded to the president already, and they only said that they wanted to only hear the side ofmy story, but it did not go any far, because it became a moot point. On the basis that the [indistinct] Committee on Intelligence was saying two things.  The first one was to say that the allegations against me were unsubstantiated from the three ministers, but secondly that there were no rules of parliament which deals with the removal of the inspector general of intelligence. So the Chairperson of the committee was saying I cannot start this particular process, because we are stillbehind and we still have to deal with that particular issue.      The matter has been put to rest now but not entirely.  When the minister of security receive the 33notices, she wrote again to the committee asking them how far are you with this complaint.  So she repeated the very same complaint again, and asked just ... and then she also attached the Rule 33 notice from this commission as well.    Yes.  So in a meeting which was held between myself and the three ministers, which was a veryhostile meeting I should also add and in the absence of the president, they requested me to give them the letter written to me by the secretary of the commission.Now in that letter normally they will just say that you are being mentioned.  I was, the office was mentioned by the likes of ambassador Moshe, Mr Matletuka, Mr Gibson Ngenge.  So the secretary who would have written to say that we thing that you can come and close some of the gaps that we have in the evidence that was given, you knowtaking into consideration the position that you are occupying, but if that letter, there were only three points that were mentioned there. The information that was required, would be that I should assist the commission in terms of the oversightpowers of the OIGI but also tell them my predecessors as well as the ministers, that we are actually working at the time of those ... of my predecessors, but then you would get a sentence which will say and any other information that you think will assist the commission.So in that meeting the ministers were really fixated on an issue to say that but the commission has told you what they require from you, and I was telling them that no, no but the commission will not waste time for me to go there and present the Oversight Act. It is in the public domain, they can just get that they have got researchers and so forth.  So I said that no, no, no they wanted certain, any other information.    And it stood there, it did not end there Chairperson.  The commission would have received a letter in an arch file where Mr [indistinct] decided to act on my behalf, as an independent office, act on my behalf to send to the commission the regulations, the Oversight Act. So those copies and the letter was addressed to theChairperson to say that we are assisting Dr Dintwe here, because it will seem as if he wants to give you more than you required.  So that letter is also in my bundle.     I was copied Chairperson.     Ja, I was addressee B, if you like CC the president.  The president was CC, the other two ministers were CC’d.     So ...[intervenes]     Minister Yanda Dlodlo of the state security.    And the crux of that letter, it will be somewhere Advocate Pretorius.     The crux of the letter is to say that the commission has requested Dr Dintwe to provide information with regard to these three points.     Who was the inspector general in this year, who was the minister during this particular period, and the legislation, the oversight and so forth.  So she decided to compile it and really demonstrate to myself that it is doable, because I was refusing to do it the way she wanted it to be done.    It was my intention and I you know, I expressed to them clearly to say that I am a person on my own right.  I am an adult.  I am an official of government, so obviously I have to write an affidavit and that affidavit cannot be based on the letter that was actually written to myself. It was based on the brainstorming session.  So theaccusation that I would have disclosed information to the commission, prior to the consultation process, it is because I would have sat with the investigators from the commission, and we will just have a discussion just to see which points the commission will have an interest on. So it was based on that.  So I had an idea already of how my affidavit was going to look like.  So I was saying that my affidavit will have to be accompanied by these annexures, and that is the reason why I am then consulting with yourselves. So I was telling them that as much as I would have loved to only send this information, I have made a commitment [indistinct] on the brainstorm session that I will be able to share information on these other aspects which were not necessarily in the letter.    I have decided that Chairperson, and it is a critical point because it talks to intelligence of the office of the inspector general of intelligence, but it alsodemonstrates how the office has been attacked from time to time. You can imagine, I mean if I have to deal with certain allegations which are unsubstantiated, it takes about five days out of my work to only go and deal with those complaints.  So even this one will demonstrate that point I think when you go to independence.     I see that Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.     It provides for the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.    The Oversight Act says that the inspector general of intelligence shall be functionally accountable to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.     Power 19 in other words.     I think ...[intervenes]     Departments, yes Chairperson.   And then it is the only committee of parliament that conducts its business behind closed doors.     I think that is the one significant difference.     That is correct.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.  ADV PRETORIUS    That is correct Chairperson.  I think that one can also even draw a comparison between the inspector general of intelligence and the public protector.  The other one will be a simple majority I think.  50 plus one.  This one is a two third.    That office does not have inspector general of intelligence for a period of 22 months.  This was occasioned by this voting.  So there were interviews, two interviews if my memory serves me well, and in each casethe interviewing panel which is the parliamentarians, the members of the committee, would have recommended somebody. But every time they went to a national assembly, they could not gather necessary majority.  So you know, it will then fall by its way side and then the second one came again until I got appointed, but for 22 months my predecessor had left that particular office.     It is not only a bad thing, it is actually a dangerous thing because I mean, even if you are reading literature, sometimes you will really struggle to fathom what the intelligence services are doing.  Not even in our jurisdiction, but you cannot really sit with intelligent services that go unchecked. If certain things even happened in this country, in the existence of the inspector general of intelligence of the office itself at least, you would then realise how important the existence of such office is and how dangerous it canactually be if they go, they go unchecked. Because this office Honourable Chair, it then it becomes like IPID, but only I sometimes say in a simplified manner one can say that it is the public protector of the intelligence services, because if you look at what we do,like we investigate maladministration, corruption, compliance with the constitution, compliance with applicable legislation and so forth. So if you look at our functions, it is only that we are doing that, but then it means that the existence of the OIGI may sort of you know bring about the situation where these other institutions cannot come and do oversight over the intelligence services themselves. There was a reason for that obviously, [indistinct] you know, still you know under the sail of secrecy.   That is correct.     It will have been presented to MinisterSiyabonga Twele, but when Minister Mahlobo came, it was presented to him.  The information that was given to me during briefing, is that it was done twice but the documentary proof that I have is that it was only done once. So I will have like a presentation with the date, but I also have an official in the office who says that I was part and parcel of that, and I do not have a problem to come up with an affidavit to confirm that it was presented.     Yes, no I really have to check that Chairperson.        Ja.      It is Minister David Mahlobo.     That is correct yes, it was our concern.     It is a view that I share, that the office wasnever, and even now taken seriously and Chairperson, these are the issues that I am comfortable addressing, because they belong to prior to, or they came to the fore prior to my tenure and it will be reports that I received and so forth, but again even evidence which just shows that we have since told you that ministers for instance should not involve themselves in operational matters, but you will have incidents where the minister would have you know, was involved in those issues. So those are the issues that I based on what wasgiven to me during the briefings, but it also materialised under my own tenure.      No, there is a base document.    Yes.     Which happened to deal with information which is sensitive in nature.      It is very short.  I remember that it runs up to about paragraph 46 or so.  It is not a thick document.    Yes, at least by my standards.      That is correct Chairperson. 
DINTWE:It was successfully completed,notwithstanding with difficulty, I should mention.  That is correct, I do confirm that Chairperson.  So the Joint Standing Committee of Intelligence Chairperson, will be like a portfolio committee,but they did not ... they just did not want to call it a portfolio committee, because this one will deal with defence, will deal with the police, will also deal with the state security agency. It will also deal with what we call the interception judge.  So they also report there.  Sometimes they even call the auditor general of South Africa to come there.  That is why they could join instead of just the portfolio committee.   May I please also mention to the Chairperson to say that, and we need to say what exerciseelevated this situation.  It is what you are saying advocate we will be dealing with later, which talks about how the legislation, the Oversight Act is drafted.Now the legislation does not create an office, does not say office of the inspector general of intelligence.  I amonly using this word, you cannot find it there.  It talks about IGI, and it becomes this particular person.  In the absence of that person, no one else in the office can do the work, because then it gives me the powers also to then delegate my powers. So in the absence of that - and I thought I thought maybe I should just mention that point.  No, no I am qualified in forensicinvestigations.  There is a big issue of capacity, Chairperson.  What I was informed is that the ...[intervenes]   Yes, which apply to all government departments.
