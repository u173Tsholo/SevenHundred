CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    We…    Yes.    Yes just for the record we are interrupting theevidence of Colonel Naidoo for me to hear argument on an application that has got nothing to do with him relating to Leave to Appeal – Leave to Cross-examine sought by Mr Moyane.  That is Leave to Cross-examine Minister Gordhan.  And we will resume the hearing of Colonel Naidoo’s evidence after that.  Yes okay.  Maybe we can just have everybody place themselves on record first and then Mr Mpofu can start.    Good morning Mr Mpofu.    Hm.    Yes thank you.    Thank you very much.  Thank you.    Yes, yes, yes.  It is fine ja.    No that is fine.  ADV DALI MPOFU   Well I am just going to summarise to make a few remarks that are intended to facilitate argument and expedite it.  And as you address me I will sometimes be making remarks or putting questions that might not all be intended for you really but that might be intended to assist Ms Le Roux to know what my – what is in my mind so that when she stands up – when she rises she can address all of those issues.   As you recall except in regard to one issue I dismissed Mr Moyane’s application for Leave to Cross-examine Minister Gordhan andI gave reasons for that and I subsequently asked both sides to make certain – to file affidavits or make written submissions which was done. And of the things I wanted was for Mr Gordhan to clarify a certain issue in his affidavit.   I think from his clarificatory affidavit he understands that I – he thinks I misunderstood his affidavit.  Maybe I did but if I did I think then it must be because there are various parts that might – that give one different understanding.   That issue was really whether Minister Gordhan was saying that in laying criminal charges against him Mr Moyane acted with malice.    And of course acting with malice could be based on various things.  Could be because you just do not like the person.  It could be because you have a certain illegitimate agenda.  You want toput the person in trouble.     It could be all kinds of things.  But his clarificatory affidavit well said  1. It was never – he never said in his affidavit that Mr Moyane acted with malice.  He said it was Mr Moyane’s who said in his affidavit he understood that it was implied in Mr Gordhan’s affidavit that he had acted with malice.    And – but in the end – well at some stage Mr Gordhansays in his affidavit, clarificatory affidavit that he did not know what was in Mr Moyane’s mind when he laid charges against him.    And somewhere he says whatever may have been in his mind was irrelevant.  Maybe if he had stopped there might have been no need for this hearing because maybe that would have been a ground for me to say well he is not alleging any malice against Mr Moyane in laying charges therefore there is no issue.    But in his affidavit he then     Went further and said as I understand his affidavit what he did mean or what he does mean or what he does contend is that Mr Moyane abused the legal process.  By which I mean I understand him to mean in laying charges against him Mr Moyaneabused the legal process.    And he the also says as I understand it – his affidavit.  He says in effect Mr Moyane was doing this in furtherance of …    The state capture agenda.  I may be putting this in my own words but that is how I understand it.  It may be that he is not confining this to the laying of charges.  Maybe that he goes further to say there are a lot of other things that he did while – Mr Moyane did while Mr Gordhan was Minister of Finance which Mr Moyane did as partof furthering the agenda of state capture.    Now my prima facie view is that within the context of this commission if you say that somebody did certain things to further the agenda of state capture that is quite a serious allegation and that provided all other requirements that need to be met for purposes of granting Leave to Cross-examine provided they are met the inclination would be to grant Leave to Cross-examine.  Because it is quite a serious allegation.But of course Minister Gordhan says my – the basis for me saying that Mr Moyane was acting as he did in furtherance of the agenda of state capture is now to be found in the findings of the new Nugent Commission.    So then – then the question for me arises okay howdo we deal with it. [Indistinct] did not give evidence in the Nugent Commission.  So there is the question of his version hence the – the idea that maybe if I – I and I am being inclined to grant leave there would need to be some provision for Mr Moyane to provide his version in relation to those findings.  Basically that is my thinking and most of it would have – would have been in the letter that – in the email that was sent to you.  But then you can address me you have a full picture of what is in my mind.    Yes.    The version.ADV DALI MPOFU   Yes.    Ja. Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.ADV DALI MPOFU   Hm.    Hm. ADV DALI MPOFU   Hm.    Hm.     Yes.    Ja I – I – you see as I understand his affidavit now certain parts of it give different – make you understand it differently.  I mean in the direction that I issued when I asked for the – a clarificatoryaffidavit.    Even in that direction I did say that when you read certain parts.    Yes.    Of his affidavits you think he is meaning this.    When you read other parts you think he is…    On this issue of malice.  I did say that.ADV DALI MPOFU   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja well it is an interesting situation.  I thought he equivocating you thought he is very clear.    He agrees with you he thinks he was very clear.    But you are on opposite ends about that clarity.    You would thinkADV DALI MPOFU   Anyway but when it comes to malice I think that if you try and understand what he has to say about malice insofar as you take the issue of state capture agenda out of it.  I am far from certain as to    But once you bring in the aspect of state capture it seems to me that it would be difficult to say – it would be difficult to say somebody was laying charges against you in pursuit of the agenda of state capture but he was not acting with malice. But maybe it can be argued I am not sure.    But maybe it can be argued.  That is fine.  So he may be making some distinction but it seems to me that even if one were to say let us leave out the issue of malice the moment you say what youactually mean is that this person was acting in pursuit of the agenda of state capture.    That is the kind of allegation that should ordinarily attract the grant of Leave to Cross-examine if all the requirements are met.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes now things.    Hm.    Hm.  The… ADV DALI MPOFU   The part of the concern I have and this is one of the things I am mentioning so that also Ms Le Roux can think about it.  One of the concerns I have is that – is whether the insofar as the clarificatory affidavit of Minister Gordhan says whatever Mr Moyane did he did in pursuit of the agenda of state capture to get me removed as Minister of Finance so that another Minister who would     Go along with that agenda would be put in.  Another concern I have is whether that does not have – if I allow cross- examination on it does not have the effect of opening up effectively the whole issue and issues – all the issues that I have already decided there should be no cross-examination on.  So if I were to grant Leave part of my concern is how do I make sure that this does not unravel as it were what I have already decided is not going to be the subject of cross-examination.    And of course you will recall that in – in the direction that I issued in – directing that there should be a clarificatory affidavit.    What he was saying in the previous affidavit.  So there is that issue.  So – so it would be important as far as possible it seems to me subject to argument that whatever happens if I do grant leave I should put in checks and balances that would make sure that whatever I have decided is not going to be the subject of cross-examination it should not be undermined.  So that is what is in my mindand …    You might be able to say something.    Yes.    ja.    HmADV DALI MPOFU   Hm.    Yes. ADV DALI MPOFU   Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.

Hm.    Hm.    Yes.  Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  You see if we - if we - that is why - I said earlier on if in his clarificatory affidavit Mr Moyane had stopped …    Mr Gordhan, ja had stopped - I am sorry - had stopped on saying I do not know what was in Mr Moyane’s mind whenhe laid charges …    And - and I am not saying he acted maliciously …    And if he had stopped …    There then it seems to me that that would amount to saying well there is therefore no issue that Mr Moyane acted maliciously and therefore there is no need for - to grant leave to cross-   You see, but the problem is that he went further …    And he says although I say what I have said about malice I do believe or what I do mean is that Mr Moyane abused the legal process and he abused it …    In furtherance of the agenda of State Capture.  That - that is the part that complicates things.  Well you might say it does not complicate things.    You might say it simplifies.  I mean from the question of principle as I said you know once you say that for me the inclination is to grant leave provided other requirements for leave to    But of course he - he is not in his clarificatory affidavit he does not say it is because of A, B, C, D that I am saying.    He says it is because of these findings that have been made.  Now those findings that have been made have been made on the basis of evidence before the Commission that Commission or on the basis of whatever material and then there is the concern also whether one does not then end up - open up the whole inquiry that was    You know but at the same time I cannot make a finding that anybody or let me not say anybody.  I cannot make a finding that Mr Moyane acted in furtherance of the agenda of State Capture and say - make that finding on the basis of what Justice Nugent found …    Without my own evaluation of the basis and the evidence for that.    So that creates the problem because - so - so you might …    Want to say something about that.    Ja.    Hm.    Yes. ADV DALI MPOFU   Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    So your argument - is your argument this?  That when - when Mr Gordhan’s filed his original affidavit there was no - there were no findings by the Nugent Commission and when he gave evidence before the Commission.  There were no findings - there was no final report.  I may be getting the facts …    The timing wrong.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    No, no.  No, no I am not talking about the rogue unit.

It is simply because we see things    But we - we are committed to do our best to make sure there is fairness.

Let me hear Ms Le Roux.ADV DALI MPOFU   Ms Le Roux you have heard everything that …    I wanted you to be able to hear?    Yes.    Yes.ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX   Yes.    Of course you - of course you did hear what I said …    To Mr Mpofu which was more meant for - for you …    Well he - he never said - well Mr Mpofu might disagree with this but I am saying this also not necessary having refreshed my memory on everything that he said in previous affidavits …    But I did not understand him to have said in hisoriginal affidavit that Mr Moyane had acted in furtherance of the agenda of State Capture, because if he had said that definitely Mr Moyane in his answering affidavit would have dealt with that head-on, and I doubt that it would have escaped my attention when I prepared my previous judgment, but maybe there is something, when there are so many affidavits you might miss something.    But it is possible that one might have to read the affidavits in a certain way so I am not saying that just because I might    Yes.ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX   Yes, you see if you go back to my judgment/ruling you will see that there is a part where I say if you go to certain parts of Mr Gordhan’s affidavit, I hope I explained it like this, maybe I did not explain it the way I am explaining it, you know certainly when you read the affidavit you could – you found parts where he was saying you know the bringing of criminal charges, the prosecution seems to have been part of an agenda, let us call it State Capture agenda, okay, but my difficulty was now I do not know whether he means – I do not know whether he excludes the laying of charges when he talks about things being done as part of the State, the bringing of charges ja, in other words when he said the bringing of charges was part of this agenda did he mean, did he include the laying of charges by Moyane or did he only talk about the 27 questions, the decision to charge and not the layingof the complaint.So that was part of the difficulty and then, bearing in mind, a lot of things that had been said in the affidavit about the two of them, in the various affidavits about Mr Gordhan and Mr Moyane you then say what are the chances that he is excluding him from this accusation that the bringing of charges was part of the agenda, then you doubt that he is excluding him.    But then when you read somewhere you say maybe he is excluding him, maybe he is focusing on the Hawks and the NPA,those are the institutions that he is talking about when he says they were bringing these charges as part of some agenda, and then you are not sure, hence my seeking clarification you see, that is where I came from, I just had difficulty understanding whether he was excluding him    Yes.    Mmm.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX   Yes.    Mmm.    Mmm.    Well let us take it step by step.  As you stand there are you able to say to me, and maybe you have already said so, but I just want to make sure there is no misunderstanding, that Mr Gordhan is not saying that in laying charges against him Mr Moyane was actingmaliciously, one, or was acting in furtherance of the State Capture agenda.  Are you able to say that?    Mmm.    Mmm.ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX   Yes let us try and deal with it this way, so I go back to my question; are you able as you stand there to say to me Minister Gordhan is not saying that in laying charges against him Mr Moyane    Because if that is what you say I think it may make a big difference.    That is what you are saying?    Yes.ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX   Yes.    Yes.    You see it seems to me that if Mr Gordhan’s positionis as far as the laying of charges against him by Mr Moyane is concerned he is not saying that the laying of charges was done in furtherance of State Capture.   It seems to me therefore that whatever he may be saying in his clarificatory affidavit about that associates Mr Moyane with State Capture might be relating to other things other than the laying of charges and if it relates to other things and not the laying of charges it might mean that the issue of the application for leave to cross-examine that was left undecided can be decided on its own and then Minister Gordhan might have to make up his mind whether he does want to thencome up with something separate which on my reading of his affidavits, which might be different from Mr Mpofu’s reading, might not have been there.  So where he might say I actually do believe that Mr Moyane did a number of things in pursuance of the agenda of State Capture, here is the basis for my belief and I am willing to come and give evidence, that affidavit gets given to Mr Moyane, he is able to respond to it and then everything is clean you know, it can be dealt with, everybody knows where they stand and about what, but then it becomes a separate thing.  That is part of what I am thinking now.What do you have to say about that?    Of course if I am correct in the approach I justoutlined the consequence of that may well be that therefore in saying what he said about State Capture in his clarificatory affidavit Mr Gordhan was saying something that had nothing to do with the issue at hand, because the issue at hand was whether in laying charges Mr Moyane acted maliciously or as part of the State Capture if the position is that he is saying the laying of charges, he is not saying that the laying of charges was part of furthering the aim of State Capture, then really whatever he said might be what he believes but it therefore might not have been relevant to the issue.    Yes.    But of course ...[intervenes] ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX   Yes.    You see in the direction that I issued where I asked whether he meant that in laying charges Mr Moyane abused legal process or whatever wording I used.  I was talking about the laying of charges and nothing else, therefore he should only have responded to that within the context of the laying of charges, but if – but from whatyou say it seems that you are saying as far as the laying of charges is not associating that with State Capture but other things that Mr Moyane may have done while he was Commissioner of SARS there are other things that he is associating Mr Moyane within the context of State Capture, so my question is then he should not have bothered to tell me about those because all I was interested in was the laying of charges, you understand that?    Yes, but remember that, at least as far as I recall now, and I may be mistaken, none of that was put within the context of State Capture, as I understand it, I may be mistaken, but the – what he added in his clarificatory affidavit was quite so clear, he says Mr Moyane acted in furtherance of State Capture.  Now this is the State Capture Commission, if somebody is accusing somebody of acting in furtherance of State Capture surely theCommission wants to hear more about that, and – but I don’t want us to ...[intervenes]     I don’t want us to go around in circles.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, but ...[intervenes]     No, no, no I ...[intervenes]     Yes, no, no, no ...[intervenes]     I think we should put it this way.  Anyone who has information suggesting that anybody was part of the State Capture Agenda should come forward and bring that information to the Commission.   They bring that information by way of a statement or affidavit, once the Commission has got that it makes a copy available to the persons implicated therein.   They get a chance to respond and at some stage somebody will give evidence and applications for leave to cross-examine will be made, but that is what – and then that’s where the issue comes up that if you want be granted leave to cross-examine you must up your version.    You know.   So that is why it may well be that in the light of the stance you have taken, and I think it would be important that maybe there be another affidavit where Mr Gordhan confirmsexactly what you have said.  It may well be that therefore if Mr Gordhan wants to supply the Commission with whatever information that he has personal knowledge of that suggests that Mr Moyane was acting in furtherance of the agenda of State Capture maybe he can then put that up afresh and then that can be given to Mr Moyane, he gets a chance to respond, and we take it from there, but maybe this one can be closed on the basis, and I know Mr Mpofu is still going to going to have a right of reply and Mr Pretorius has not said anything, it may be that if Mr Gordhan says I am not saying that in laying charges against me Mr Moyane acted infurtherance of the State Capture, I am not saying that he acted maliciously, maybe that should close off one chapter, and the if there is going to be another chapter then it is a new chapter.Yes?

This is what happened.  This is what happened andtherefore …    This - this is the conclusion.    To the extent that I might have seen the Sikhakhane report.

Thank you very much, okay.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Yes.    Yes.ADV THANDI NORMAN SC   Yes, and there is no problem from the legal teams?    Okay.    Yes, okay alright.  Okay then we will postpone the hearing of the evidence Lieutenant General Matakata to a date to be determined later and in the meantime the legal team must make arrangements to request Mr Jonas to depose to an affidavit or affirmed declaration dealing with the versions put up in the affidavit of Major General Nonopi, I hope I’ve got the title correct and Lieutenant General Matakata.    Ja I hope I’ve got all of those correct.    And if this could be dealt with, today’s the 2 n d of October, if we could have Mr Jonas’ affidavit not later than the 20 t h of    Yes, and of course once that his affidavit is at hand it will be important to give a copy to Lieutenant General Matakata to have a look at and if there’s a need to respond to anything to also respond as well as General Nonopi.    And then once we have got all of those then hopefully it will be quite clear where the areas of dispute are or there might not be much in terms of areas of dispute, there might be a convergence ofviews on some of the issues at least.  Probably there will still be some issues that remain in dispute.    Ja, no that’s fine.  Thank you very much Lieutenant General Matakata you are excused and you’ll be advised of another date but thank you very much for coming forward to give evidence, thank you.    Yes you are also excused, thank you. Miss Wentzel we are the only ones that are not excused.  Yes good morning Miss Wentzel, good morning Colonel Naidoo.    Yes, okay are we ready?      Okay, no that’s fine, is that alright with you Miss    So these issues can be investigated further and depending on the outcome of the investigation Colonel could come back and talk about – give evidence about them or other witnesses could be called.    Or both.    Okay alright.      I’m sorry were you told why it was necessary for you to take this vehicle to Atlantis Motors?      You were not told at that stage? COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO     And then you say after two weeks, I either got a call or had a conversation with Colonel Barnard, he asked me to collect the BMW from Mr Venter, who’s a dealer principal at Atlantis and that I must take that particular vehicle to Leo Haese where I encountered a Mr Nico Visser.  Chair Leo Haese is a BMW dealership in Pretoria.  Mr Nico Visser is sales person at Leo Haese Pretoria.      Okay before we proceed let’s go back to when you took the car to Atlantis, did you not have to say why you were brining the car there or did you find that somebody knew about - was expectingthe car and somebody had spoken to them about it?      Yes, okay then two weeks later General Lazarus      Oh Colonel Barnard?      Ja and asked you to take it where? COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO     Yes.      What’s the name of the gentleman?      Okay yes.      Okay.      Yes okay.      Yes.      Wanted?      Yes.      Yes.      He said does he know what?      Oh okay talking about the same car?      Okay at that stage you also didn’t know or did youknow how much had been spent on this car?      Yes but tell me whether you knew at that stage or not?      Ja okay.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      I’m sorry what page is that document?      Oh I thought I missed it.      Okay alright.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO     Yes.      Yes.      Well maybe let’s do it this way.  You took General Mdluli’s BMW to Leo Haese?    But you found when you arrived there that it appeared that there was some understanding by the people there what the car was there for, is that right?    Yes.  Now you say that at a certain level of – for the initial stage we must take the position to be that the vehicle was there for sale to Leohaese by General Mdluli.    And then later on you say we can then take it as a trade in?  Is that right?    No – did the discussion that he may have had with you reveal that the car was being traded in with them?    Not at that stage.    Okay.  But he did talk about the fact that the crack onthe windscreen would devalue the car?    Okay.  And then you say later on Crime Intelligence bought two vehicles, is that right?    And do you have – how much those vehicles – what their prices were?    Yes    Okay.  And you said also that when General Mdluli’s vehicle was taken to Leohaese it had not been paid up in terms of Hire Purchase or Credit Agreement?    You were not aware at that stage?    But you subsequently got aware?COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   And when you subsequently became aware is the position that you became aware that there was an amount of is it R50 000,00 outstanding?  That was still to be paid?    Okay.  Okay.  So when you heard about the purchase of the two vehicles by Crime Intelligence – okay you said these were bought from Leohause?    Ja.  How – was there a connection between the buying of those two vehicles and General Mdluli’s vehicle being at Leohaese?    Hm.    So – so in purchasing the two vehicles you say CrimeIntelligence was entitled to a certain discount?    And instead of Leohaese giving them – giving them that discount he did not give them the discount but the money was    Okay.  So would this have been reflected in the books of Leohaese do you know?    The discount that was not given to Crime Intelligence was that a discount that was always given to – or that was general speaking given to Crime Intelligence whenever they bought vehiclesfrom Leohaese?    Okay.  Ms Wentzel.    Now the vehicle the General Mdluli vehicle that weare talking about that you took to initially Mr Venter and later Mr Visser that was his personal car?    Now in order for – in order for General Mdluli’s personal BMW to have been taken as a trade-in what – General Mdluli would have had to be given a personal car by Leohease, is it not?  Because he – if he was trading in his personal car that would mean he is buying another car – another personal car is it not?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes but you are not saying that his car was then to besold and he was going to get the – any money out of that.    Yes.    Page 206?    Yes.    You see General Mdluli when his BMW was taken to Leohaese if on his credit agreement with the relevant bank owed a balance of R90 000.00 and he – he arranged that Crime Intelligenceshould buy two cars but that the discount which should have come to – been given to Crime Intelligence should not be given to Crime Intelligence instead it should be given to him because it should be used to settle his balance with the bank for the BMW.  If that is what happened and the BMW remained with Leohaese and became their car then – then – and these other cars were Crime Intelligence official cars it seems to me that he sold the vehicle to Leohaese for R90 000.00 which should have been for the benefit of Crime Intelligence but it was used for his benefit.  Am I way off the mark?    Because you see he – you are not saying that he asked for any balance from Leohaese for the vehicle, is it not?  You do not know anything about any balance?    No, no I am not talking about that balance.    You see as I understand the position if I have a car which is still under a bank I cannot sell it to you without the consent of the bank.  If I sell it to you without the consent of the bank that agreement is illegal.  But the bank can give their consent and if I still owe the bank R90 000.00 and I – the value of the car might not be R90 000.00 it might be R200 000.00 – it might be R150 000.00 so I might then say well you must pay me R150 000.00 and when you payme that I take R90 000.00 and I pay the bank.  But it may be that for XYZ reasons I say to you if you can give me the R90 000.00 that I owe the bank that balance – if you can pay it then that is the – then you can have the car I do not want anything on top of that.  I just want to get out of this obligation.  You see the ownership of the car gets transferred.  So if Leohaese was to keep the vehicle the BMW and the value of the BMW was more than R90 000.00 so it may be that Mdluli – General Mdluli effectively sold the car to Leohaese for R90 000.00 that Leohaese had to pay to the bank.  Or am I causing you more    I will let Ms Wentzel – maybe she might give clarity.    Yes but if it unfolded the way that I am explaining it then it might be a misnomer to talk about a trade-in.  It might be that it was simply for all intents and purposes a sale.  But Crime Intelligence being prejudiced in the process.  I think Ms Wentzel is dying to say something so Ms Wentzel you might wish to say something or clarify or ask questions that will bring some clarity?    Let us proceed.  I think I am not the only one who does not understand what it is.  Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    .Yes.    Okay. ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Ja.    Yes.    Yes. COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Was it a man or a woman?    Lalu was it a man or a woman?    Okay.    Ja.  No.  These people liked …    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Okay.    Was it like over weekends or during the weekdays or    Okay.    Yes.  Yes, continue.    Hm.    Hm.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.    Do - do you know - I am sorry.  Do you know of any reason why when you were all operating from Gauteng the travel agent in Durban had to be used - Westville Travel Agents?    Huh-uh. COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   But Westville Travel Agents would have some records?    I would - for their own purposes they would have kept some records I guess.    But you do not know do you whether as part of his investigation Colonel Roelofse has made contact with them and has their records or part of their records?    The - the records that were mentioned in connection with destruction were they records of the Westville Travel Agency?    Yes.  That is what I am talking about insofar as they    But you do not know whether that was - that plan was carried out?    Okay, alright.    Yes.    (Indistinct) of approximately R40 000,00?    What was the obsession with R40 000,00?    Was there anything like if it is above R40 000,00 maybe there were certain procedural requirements or certain things to be done and you have to keep it not more than R40 000,00 or    Okay, alright.  Yes.  Continue.    Yes.    So do you know whether in some cases even with regard to General Mdluli General Lazarus could just say something like it looks like you know you need some security upgrade in your house?  Let us do that or say to you Colonel Naidoo do you not need renovations to be made in your house or do you not need a new car. Does your wife not need a new car and then things would then be bought on the - with S - with the Secret Service Account money.  I mean one - one gets the impression that you know money was    Yes.    Yes.    What page?    121?    At General Mdluli’s Dawn Park Residence?    Okay.  So this is - this is an application that you had to make to whom?    Yes. COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Did the - did this - did the fact that this was in writing and that it was approved did it make it legitimate or that had nothing to do with its legitimacy?  It was just because it had to be done.  There had to be some paperwork.    Hm.    Well - so you would not know whether General Mdluli was entitled to any security upgrade in his residence at the expense of Crime Intelligence?    Yes, okay.  Continue.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Well I am sorry we are at five past one but I think we are close to finishing.    So I think let us just go on and finish and then … ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   We can take - adjourn for the day.    Ja, okay.  Is that fine with you Colonel Naidoo?    Okay.    I am sorry.  I think I have - I thought you were going to 2-4-9.  You have gone beyond that hey.  Was 2-4-9 taken care of?    Oh, okay.  Are you at 2-5-1 now?    He did not say to you that General Mdluli had received an instruction from the Minister?    Okay.  So this was an error on your part?    Okay.    Yes and the instruction from General Mdluli according    Was?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    That is MF - I am sorry.  FM46?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    I am sorry.  I must have missed something.  Concerns    Oh, you mean the concerns about the delay?    Yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Okay.    Those claims would relate to - that is to get money to buy - buy material and to pay for labour?    Travelling?    So the actual building of the wall was undertaken by an agent?    Oh.    Oh, he oversaw the project …    But did not necessarily do the actual building of thewall?    He got somebody else to do that?    Contractors.    Okay.  Okay.  What - did the - the wall that or the wall that was built did it go right round the house or there was another wall and there was maybe one side or two sides that did not have a wall or what was the position?    But when you went there before - before the wall was built was there a wall that was there already.  Either going right round the house or was there no wall at all or was there a wall that covered one side of the house and not other sides?    Okay, alright.  Yes continue.    Yes.    I’m sorry, where are you now Ms Wentzel?    Okay.    So just repeat that?    Yes.  And General Lazarus said General Cele gave him permission to use the Secret Service Account funds to pay for his, that is General Lazarus’ attorneys fees.    Okay.  ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   Yes.    Well let us start with what were the charges that General Lazarus was facing, you do not have necessarily to – I do not expect you necessarily to be exact in terms of how they were termed but in terms of substance what, as far as you know what charges was    Did some of the allegations relate to matters that you have covered in your evidence in this Commission relating to the ...[intervenes]     Yes, okay so was it fraud related, corruption relatedallegations?    Yes okay and you say he was found guilty and was dismissed?    Okay, was your evidence – were the allegations based to a very large extent on your evidence or is that something that you are unable to say?    Yes, yes, so – but what I mean is your evidence was as far as you know quite important for the disciplinary inquiry, or is thatsomething you do not know?    Oh, you do not know what he was dismissed for?    You do not know the outcome of that disciplinary process?    Yes but do you know whether his dismissal emanated from the disciplinary inquiry in which you testified?    Ja, what you do not know is which of the charges he may have been found guilty of?    Yes, but the dismissal followed the disciplinary hearing in which you testified?    Okay, alright, Ms Wentzel?    You might wish to formulate your question much morenarrowly because I think I know what you are looking for, but if you put it like that you are inviting him to tell us everything about that inquiry.    Ja.    Well let me put it for you.   Did you ever get a chance subsequent to that disciplinary inquiry to know the findings that were made by the Chairperson of that inquiry, either in – ja in writing, did you ever get to know his ruling or his decision and the reasons that hegave for his decision?    As you speak today have you been given that document in preparation for this – in preparation for your evidence in this Commission?    Okay, well Ms Wentzel might have something to say about that.    Mmm, how come?    Yes, but how can it be dealt with him now without him having had a chance to read the ruling and understand exactly what it says and how it affects him.    It could have been given to him even last week.    As I understand it the – you or Mr Petersen you were aware of it at the time of even before Colonel Roelofse gave evidence.    That was brought to his attention?    Okay.    But was he not given the whole ruling to read?    He was shown but not given to take home and read?    Why not?    Yes, but I am saying it is only fair that he should havea copy especially if certain findings were made that are adverse to him and – because that maybe may come up, it is only fair that he should have the benefit of reading the whole ruling.    Ja I am concerned about giving him an opportunity to comment on that in circumstances where he has not had the benefit of reading the whole ruling, that is my concern, and I do not know if he appreciates the disadvantage that he may be putting himself under if he wants to comment on part of the ruling without reading the whole ruling, and the reasons.    Yes, why don’t you say you give him the judgment, the ruling, he reads the whole ruling, then you say after that I want to put certain questions to you, then he can comment with a full understanding of the context.    So he has read the whole judgment, the whole ruling?    Okay, hang on, Colonel Naidoo?    You understand the exchange that I have been having with Ms Wentzel?    Yes, but I am asking you whether you have been following the exchange between myself and Ms Wentzel?      Ja but why must you speak about this piecemeal, are you not going to want to deal later with other aspects of the ruling?      No, no, no I’m not happy about this.  Give Colonel Naidoo the whole ruling, he must have a chance to read it properly, he might not appreciate certain things, he might be in a rush to commenton things without reading it.  He must be given the opportunity to read the whole ruling properly and then at some stage or another he can then deal with it.  Deal with any aspect of the ruling and not piecemeal so – and as I say he should have been given a copy, his own copy to read at his own time…[intervenes].      Long before today so I don’t want to allow any question relating to the ruling.      That may relate to any adverse finding made againsthim until he has had – he has read the whole ruling.      And in terms of when he may be asked there is, I think, no reason why we should then now adjourn for a short time to read that and we come back.  I think he can be given a full copy, if you have got no other questions, if you’ve got other questions outside of the ruling you can ask him and we can finish for the day otherwise if and when anybody is granted leave to cross-examine him then he can come back and before he is cross-examined he can be asked questions on whatever you wanted to ask him.  He can deal with any questions having fully read the ruling, I think that is how we should deal with it.      Ja you understand Colonel Naidoo?      Yes so before anybody will be able to say, but  suchand such an adverse finding was made against you, he must have had a chance to read the whole ruling and be ready to deal with any question.      Okay.     Ja that’s fine.      Yes.      So the position is that you appreciate that you have no immunity from prosecution as things stand and that you may well be charged but you may well not be charged.  You are ready to face any consequences of your own actions?      Does that mean that they – the Hawks have made the decision that from their part they will treat you as such a witness?      Yes okay but before that decision was taken you had      Okay.      And you were making the point earlier that you didn’t even go and get your own lawyer to assist you and guide you and– so that you could have some legal protection.  You went to meet with the Hawks on your own without a lawyer?      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes.    Both to you and your family.    Yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.      You have no further questions.    Thank you very much Colonel Naidoo.  I have no idea what it must be like to be in witness protection – in a witness protection program.  I have no idea what it must be like to have your whole family in a witness protection program for one year.  I have no idea how it must be like to have your whole family, your wife and your children in a witness protection program for seven or eight years.  I understand thatwhen you are in a witness protection program your freedom of movement is very limited and you live a life that is very unlike the life you would have lived before going into such a program.  So it must really be quite difficult.  I must thank you Colonel Naidoo for coming forward to give evidence to the commission.  Persons who are implicated by you in your evidence will have opportunities to apply for Leave to cross-examine you and will have opportunities to apply to give evidence themselves.  I do not know what conclusions I will reach later in the work of the commission when I look at your evidence as well as the evidence of those who are implicated in your evidence.  But I dothink that it was important that if you believed that you had been party to various acts of criminality and corruption involving tax payers money that you spoke to the Hawks and placed before them what you believed were the facts and in that way you may have helped in us understanding what may have been going on in Crime Intelligence and it may be that all of this will also help in measures being taken to avoid criminality happening within Crime Intelligence particularly with regard to the Secret Service Account and society does need people who will give cooperation to law enforcement agencies when there are suspicions of criminality particularly with corruption which has reached very unacceptable levels in our country.  And without some of the people in society making decisions to tell the authorities about wrongs that may be happening not much can be done.  So I just want you to know that I think I do have an appreciation that what you and your family must have gone through over the past seven/eight years couldnot have been easy and must have been difficult.  And I want you to know and your family to know that I really appreciate and the commission appreciates the sacrifices that you may have done in order to try and share with the nation what you believe are the facts of what happened.  As I say other people will come forward and will put what they believe are the facts and in due course I will make findings but I appreciate very much that you made yourself available and we probably will ask you to come back because you also might need to deal with certain aspects relating to the ruling. But there is some further investigation that needs to be conducted in regard to some of theaspects of your affidavit. Those where you also felt that more investigation needed to be done before you could deal with them because you were not sure of the facts in regard to those – so – but thank you very much for coming to share with the commission and with the nation what you know in terms of what has been happening or whathappened in Crime Intelligence. I have already asked the Head of the legal team of the commission to be in touch with relevant authorities with a view to getting finality on the issue of the declassification of documents that may be important for some of the allegations that you have dealt with and that Colonel Roelofse dealt with as well.  But thank you very much Colonel Naidoo we appreciate your having come forward.    Yes.  We are therefore going to adjourn the proceedings for the day and the legal team will be in touch with youColonel Naidoo in regard to the other matters and also in due course when you may have to come back. Tomorrow the commission is scheduled to hear the remaining evidence of Mr Thabethe the former Head of Department of the Department of Agriculture in the Free State.  That is scheduled for tomorrow and Friday because he did not finish his evidence.  But we will not be able to start in the morning because tomorrow the judiciary will be – will be accounting to the nation with regard to its activities and that will be happening at the Constitutional Court. The Chief Justice will be doing that and I need to be there for the morning.  So we will start here tomorrow at two to then hear thefurther evidence of Mr Thabethe.  I thought I must mention that so that those who might need to be here they know that we will only start at two.  We will then adjourn for today.  We adjourn.

Hm.    Hm.    Yes.  Thank you – thank you Chairperson and also thank you for – for giving us a preview so to speak of your prima facieview.  It might or might not depending on the attitude of Ms Le Roux or Mr Gordhan curtail the proceedings.Well Chairperson the – then really we have two issues that I need to deal with – broad issues.  There might be sub-issues within them.The first one which I want to deal with very quickly is to confirm that your prima facie view is – is correct.  If I persuade you that that prima facie view is correct or if Ms Le Roux does not say anything to disturb that prima facie view then I will address you Chair on what should then happen.The options – there were two options which you presented.    Option 1 was that you would grant leave or rather you would ask for     And then – and then give a ruling.    Option 2 was that you would grant leave.    Provisionally so to speak.    Grant leave provisionally.    In our response last night to you we – we presented a third option.    In my second leg.    That third option is that – is that the Chair should actually grant leave unconditionally and I will address the Chair as to why and that is because we – our view is that the linkage which the Chair has just articulated between the allegations of malice if they stand and the Nugent Report is – is in our view unsubstantiated and it cannot stand.  And I will address Chair on that. So let us start quickly with the first issue.  Chair the – you will recall that we – in our submissions which we filed on the 28 May 2019.    We made the point that the Chair is making.  Namely that it is – one cannot say that the allegations were not made without malice.  It is inconsistent with the very affidavit of Mr Gordhan.  That is why we did not even file an affidavit because our view was that it would be a waste of the time of the commission.  Because in his own affidavit there is enough to sustain the accusation.  And we quoted page 2 of that document – some of the – theexcerpts that the Chair was referring to.  We say – he has never denied the imputation of malice and I will explain why we say that.All he say he does it what we lawyers call confession and avoidance.  In other words he says yes you were malicious but it is irrelevant.  Ja.Now I will show you Chair that it cannot be irrelevant and once you remove the avoidance so to speak then you are left with the confession which is that it was malicious and therefore on that basis the Leave to Cross-examine should be granted.And we then list very – the – four quotation from the – from his affidavit.  It is at 7.1 of our submissions.  Rather paragraph 7.  He says at paragraph 15 of his affidavit I am quoting the affidavit of Mr Gordhan. “The key point of my evidence was my personal belief that the entire process of investigation and brining – bringing which is what Mr Moyanidid and withdrawal of charges against me by the NPA was part of a campaign of state capture institutions.”He then says at paragraph 22.4. “I therefore do mean that the Mr Moyane was motived wholly or in part or he sought to advance the objectives of state capture and he was abusing a    Hm.    Going this way.    He is going…    Even in your ruling by the way.    You said well we differ. CHAIRPERSON   We differ with that.    Because you said in the ruling if I remember the words.    That he equivocating.    Now our view of course is that he was not    But    That is malicious.    Yes.    Yes yes of course.    Yes.    Yes.  That is enough.    Yes.    Thank you Chair I will not even spoil that – that is exactly what we are saying.  In other words the alternative and shortcutso to speak is to say let us forget about this debate about malice.    And the semantic meaning of malice.  Let us just look at what he says forget malice.  I therefore do mean that Mr Moyane was motivated wholly or in part or he sought to advance the objectives of state capture in laying the charges.  It cannot be clearer than that.    So that address is a double barrel answer to the whole issue because it both addresses the question of motive but it also addresses the question of relevance.  Because if he was doing this to advance some other motive about football…    Ja then it had nothing to do with you Chair.  But if he is doing it – the malice the kind of malice is in advancement of statecapture then it is likely in your zone.  This after all is the state capture commission.    So anything – any accusation that is motivated by state capture must be – must be – well  a. Is clearly negative to Mr Moyane’s interests so that he wants to cross-examine on it but  b. It is relevant to this commission. So I will not address that any further Chair.  As I say the affidavit    It does not even deal in the so called malice and motive from the laying of the charges which is the core accusation.  It says that action of bringing was part of a campaign of state capture.    Pliant.    Yes.    Hm.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Ja Chair…    Yes no I will – again I will not spend much time on that because we will probably cross that bridge     If and when we come to it.    But suffice to say the following   If you remember we had 5 themes.    The Chair …    Refused     Cross-examination and by the way the – we have instructions to take that decision on review.    But that is a matter for another day.CHAIRPERSON   The – as far as theme 5 is concerned and the issue that the Chair narrowly defined.    Chair you are quite correct.  There is bound to be some spill over.    That spill over however can be contained.    And the spill over comes for example in thefollowing fashion.    You remember when you opened Chair you said that Mr Gordhan says that his attitude was informed by the Nugent    Yes.  Now that issue is clearly integrally related to – to this question.    And number 1.  Number 2 you wall also remember that our argument was always that – remember there are two things here.  At the end the Chair must either accept Mr Gordhan’s version.    That Mr Moyane is a state capturer.    Or it must – the Chair must accept that no Mr Gordhan acted as any commissioner of SARS would have acted in those circumstances.    There is no halfway house.    Now – for that to happen then obviously Mr Moyane is going to have to take the Chair into his confidence even interms of the questions that he puts as to why he says that his version is correct.  Mr Gordhan on the other hand in answering the questions will say no, no, no all that notwithstanding you were part of the conspiracy or whatever.  So it is inevitable that questions such as the – whether the reliance on the Nugent Commission was correct will be – will be – will have to be answered.  What even compounds it further is that since we last spoke here there have been two significant developments in regard to this so called rogue unit issue which was at the core of the charges.  And that is that there is a Public Protectors Report on the rogue unit and the Chair only has to take judicial notice that it exists not that it is good or bad or indifferent.  There is such a thing.  The second is that the Inspector General’s Report which was part of what Mr Moyane relied on has been and I am using the word loosely borrowing from the media declassified.  I do not think it is – it goes that far but let us just say at least it is in the public domain.  Nowit is not possible for Mr Moyane Chair to convince you or Mr Gordhan or anybody that he was acting bona fide without saying I relied on the Sikhakhane Report.  I relied on the KPMG Report.  I relied on the Kroon Report.  I relied on the IGI – the IGI Report.  And by the way the so called Nugent Report final Nugent Report that is now being used opportunistically did not even exist.  It – the – Mr Moyane his charges were in 2015.  Mr Gordhan’s evidence here was in November 2018 and Mr Nugent’s final report was in December 2018.  So when you are sitting here you could not have been motivated by anything that Mr Nugent said.  And that is why Chair I am almost getting into my secondargument. That is why we say the – it is a red herring this whole thing of the Nugent Commission and the Chair should give the Leave to Cross-examine without any regard to whatever is in the Nugent Commission.  And the reason – we have outlined four reasons why that is so Chair.  One is that – we say the actually this suggestion is motivated by what we call perjury on the part of Mr Gordhan.  Because Mr Gordhan the Chair was correct in his summary of the – in the ruling that Mr Gordhan actually says that at page 399 in his affidavit  “More important for the purposes of this application the Nugent Commission specifically found that the so called rogue unit was lawfully established and recommended that it sought to be re-established.”     I am …    No, no, no Chair. CHAIRPERSON   It goes to the second question.    Which is whether the Chair should give the - should grant - if you grant the …    Conditionally.    My point is that there is no room for the Chair to say I will grant you conditionally.  You must address what happened inNugent.  With Nugent …    Justice Nugent - sorry.    Is completely irrelevant …    To this question of …    Of malice.  In other words the Chair …    Is what we said in our letter as option three.    Namely to delink … CHAIRPERSON   The - the leave to cross-examine …    From the …    From whatever said …    Was said and - and the - the final point I was making in that respect Chair …    To - to crown it all …    Mr Moyane did exactly what Justice Nugent said about three or four times.    That if anybody has any information they must go to the authorities.    The police.    So how on earth can - can … CHAIRPERSON   If - if - the Chair …    At the end of it all is then left with these two versions.    How - how can the Chair not be convinced or rather at least there be no grounds for cross-examination …    To establish …CHAIRPERSON   The fact that there are these four reports …    Which were operating in Mr …    Moyane’s mind …    And therefore that Mr Gordhan is wrong …    Or - or lying that he was motivated by malice.CHAIRPERSON   For what is - I am not now obviously that will be argued at the end …    After the cross-examination. CHAIRPERSON   All I am saying now is that …    That if - there is - there is - there can never be more ground for - for cross-examination than that.    Mr Gordhan.    Yes.    Yes.    Stopped.    Ja.    In the advancement.    It simplifies things.    He does.    Ja.    Yes.    Chair …    Yes.  No Chair.CHAIRPERSON   No Chair.  Okay.  Let me try …    Again.CHAIRPERSON   The point I am making Chair …    Is that there is no connection …    And whatever Judge Nugent found.    If it was true …    And not false and not a lie …    That Judge Nugent had found that the rogue unit    And therefore that then motivated Mr Gordhan’s evidence.    Then the Chair would be right.    The Chair obviously would say well …    If - if it is based on this but if that premise is false then what has it got to do with Judge Nugent over the version ofMr Moyane and Nugent because …?    No, no.    Chair let me …    Make it easy.    In life …    Until today …CHAIRPERSON   There has never been a finding on the lawfulness of the rogue unit by Judge Nugent.  Whether it is not the standard …    Yes.    Yes.    Now I am saying - well the - those findings mustfirst exist Chair …    For you to refer to them.    They do not exist.  Judge Nugent says I am not going to investigate this issue.    What is that issue?  It is the issue that Mr Moyane went to report to the police.    In respect - in respect of which Mr Gordhan says he was motivated by State Capture.    So it is like saying - if I can say I was motivated by    And you find that that thing is not there.  Then there is no - you cannot then say oh well I want your version on …    On a non-existent …    Premise.    So the - the connect - the connection between the    State Capture motives …    And the Nugent Commission …    Big false, false, false.  It is - it is manufactured.    For the reason that a, Judge Nugent did not make such a finding.    Could not make such a finding having said it was irrelevant.    Testified here.  So if those reasons are not enough to show that the two things are not connected …    Whatsoever.    Then nothing ever will be.    Now if the two things are not connected …CHAIRPERSON   Then the Chair is at liberty - if the Chair is still of the prima facie view …    That there is an allegation of State Capture. CHAIRPERSON   What we are saying is that the Chair is at liberty to grant leave to …    To cross-examine …    Here and now or …    After consideration …    Of our arguments …    And if that is so then the third question that arises what the Chair has correctly identified.    Of circumscribing the parameters of …    Of that cross-examination …CHAIRPERSON   And that by the way is also not a mechanical process.    You remember when we argued earlier … CHAIRPERSON   We said that is what the Chair is here for.    The reason a Judge is appointed to chair the Commission …    Is because in cross-examination …    Of course Counsel might ask and …    Mr Mpofu now.    This - this is beyond the scope of …    What we agreed and so on.    So you cannot circumscribe …    Because this - these issues are intertwined but obviously it will also be the duty of Counsel …    Bring other issues …    That in respect of which there - there is still some dispute …    In another court.    Ja.CHAIRPERSON   But that …    Is not something you can legislate now.    The - the only question now …    For the Chair is does Mr Gordhan implicate …    Mr Moyane in State Capture.CHAIRPERSON   Obviously yes.    Is it necessary for Mr Moyane to clear his name in    Obviously yes.    Is it in the interest of the State Capture Commission …    To know whether Mr Moyane is furthering State Capture or not?    Obviously yes …CHAIRPERSON   And if those …    Three yeses are existent …    Then leave to cross-examine must be granted.    Obviously it is in the discretion.    We - we understand that …CHAIRPERSON   And I want to clarify one thing Chair.    To pre-empt my - Mr - Ms Le Roux might say.    It looked like it was not clear what I was saying.  We accept …    Unreservedly …    That there is no right to cross-examine.    Yes.  I did …CHAIRPERSON   But what we do not accept is that there might not be a right to cross-examine but there is a right to fairness …    And that right to fairness with respect does not even belong to you Chair.    It comes from the Constitution.    So what we demand here is fairness and fact.CHAIRPERSON   So the - the linkage between cross-examination …    And fairness I do not have to …    So we insist on our right to fairness.    In other words Mr Moyane cannot be …    Somebody cannot come here …    And say Mr Moyane is a State Capturer.    From being questioned.    I mean what is that?    Yes.  That is what I have just     My last sentence.    In other words … CHAIRPERSON   The criteria …    Chair will remember in 3.3.  Is that …    Yes.    It - it must be necessary …    The Chair must find out it is necessary …CHAIRPERSON   And that it is …    It is in the interest or …    Furthers the objectives of the Commission.    Words to that effect.    Those criteria are - are clearly …CHAIRPERSON   There my - Chairperson because it is implication.  We know that it is implicate - he is implicated …    And then - and then as far as his version which is really the issue that we have been debating …    Is concerned.  That version Chair …    Is contained amply in - in the …    In his affidavit.    It was in the - in the explanation of that version.    To Sikhakhane.    We referred to KPMG.    We referred to Kroon.    We referred to IGI.    Because again it - it did not exist …    On top of that - so there are five …    Independent reports that have found the rogue unit to exist …    And the worst one of them finds it - finds that Mr Gordhan is - is criminally …    Thereof.  Rightly or wrongly.  That - that may be debated in other forums.    The point here is that a Commission of SARS faced with these reports …    For - let us take out the Public Protector.    Would - would - if - when he goes to the police can - is he motivated by State Capture …    His duty …    But that is really the only - the only issue and if Mr Moyane succeeds …    To clear his name …  By - by - through the cross-examinationestablishing that he was motivated …    By good governance.    Then that is the end of it.    If Mr Gordhan or if Mr Moyane fails …    And Mr Gordhan’s view that he is …    That is also well and good.    So - so Chair to round it off. CHAIRPERSON   The - the …    My first prize is option three Chair.    If - if …    If you do not grant option three …    Then option two.CHAIRPERSON   Option two Chair, yes.    Because it is very important Chair.  I do not want to go into some of the broader issues …    But you know the - the - this Commission is watched by everybody out there …    And the issue of fairness …CHAIRPERSON   Is - is really central to this …    And the Chair may or may not know that there was    After the first ruling.    Rightly or wrongly …    But the point is that the - the - some of it was uniformed but - but Chair the point is that really this and - and I must commend the Chair to have isolated this issue.  Not that I agree on the other issues.  I - I strongly disagree.  I - I am …    Yes vigorously as the lawyers say.  I even disagree on the test …    That the Chair applied but that is …    A debate for another day …    But at least here the Chair to your credit identifiedan issue …    Which was the clearest - the one in your zone …    Because if someone is accused of State Capture … CHAIRPERSON   It is not like these other ones …    That might be indirect.    No we had a fight in some …    Place.  This one is literally …    In your - in your province …CHAIRPERSON   And with the greatest respect Chair the notion that there are people who are beyond cross-examination …    Must be dispelled …    Because as Mr Moyane says in his affidavit …    The root of this problem is this notion that there    And that there are people who are State Capturers …    And others are not. CHAIRPERSON   This Commission - there experience in this Commission …    Has shown that that …    Theory …    If you talk about Mr Nene …    Even Ms Munusamy …    All the so called angels …    Are not as - as pure as - as snow.    So it must - there must never be a message that    If anybody implicates Mr Moyane …    Whether it is Mr Gordhan or my junior they must …    No.    I can raise my hand.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair …    Yes.    Speaking for myself I - I accept that unreservedly …    And Chair as you correctly say I think there is also a - a misconception about the role of Commissions …    And that is why Commissions unlike Judges …    Although we benefit from …    That office. CHAIRPERSON   And that is why I say we have instructions to review your …    Your ruling …    Because unlike a judgment …    We - Commissions’ findings …    And it may be confirmed or it might be changed …    Or not and it - it will not reflect.    Ja.    And I can assure you …    None of them will be bad faith or ulterior motive or anything like that.  It will be the …    The usual grounds of - of review.    While I am on that subject I might as well say that we also hold instructions because another of the four reasons I wanted to raise was that …    Which is in the papers.  One of the reasons why I say the Chair should discard the Nugent report is because we say inthe - in our affidavit that the witness Mr Gordhan had an - an improper meeting with Judge Nugent …    Before the - the Commission started.    That is going to be subject of a complainant …    That my learned - that my client is going to lay with …    Again that will take its own …    Process. CHAIRPERSON   Save to say Chair that the - Judge Nugent at page 1-4-7 or rather not Judge Nugent.  Mr Gordhan at page 1-4-7 does admit to that meeting taking place in his own affidavit under oath and    But my parting shot is just imagine if you Chair before you started this Commission had had a preliminary meeting with Mr Zuma for example about the Commission.  There would be justifiably an outcry.  So the - these are some of the issues which will - will be ventilated by the court o the appropriate authorities.    Sorry Chair.    Ja.    Hm.    The person who appointed …    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No Chair that - that is - thank you. CHAIRPERSON   I think that helps also the public again to understand some of the nuances.  No, yes.    Chair that is correct.  I mean I was in the Marikana Commission.  Judge Farlam met with the president a hundred times.  That is - that is not what we are complaining about.    If Mr Gordhan was either the President or even the Minister of Finance at the time then the meeting might have beenexplainable but he had nothing - he was just a Minister of Cooperate Governance and a witness - a key witness in the -  in the Commission.  So there was no question about having to meet a witness before the - but again those are as I say those are issues.    So the example of - of meeting for official reasons.    No that is acceptable.    And if people see you with the President one daythey must not rush and think there is something untoward.    That we accept.    Thank you.    Thank you sir.    Those are our submissions Chair.    In short.    And …    There - there is no - the dealing cage …    And therefore the Chair is at large to grant …    To grant the - the leave to cross-examine …    Well I mean unconditionally I mean …    In relation to the Nugent issue … CHAIRPERSON   But obviously the Chair will as …    Well determine his own procedures.    As the Chair pleases.    Chair.    It is not fair to say it has been discredited.    Yes Chair.    Yes.  Chair let me – firstly I must just on a lighter note I am wary on Mr Pretorius supports my – the last time he did that the application was dismissed.      Yes I was nodding but – I was particularly noddingwhen he was saying he is being generous to Mr Gordhan because Chair on a serious note that really is a correct statement.  I do not understand Chairperson how counsel can stand here and the Chair asks her twice are you saying that Minister Gordhan is not saying that Mr Moyane was motivated by the advancement of state capture?  And Chair her answer is indeed Chair.  How you can do that Chair in the light of Mr Gordhan’s sworn affidavit which says as Mr Pretorius has    I say there is no confusion.    It is very clear what Mr Gordhan is saying.    And all he must do is either to justify it or not – justify it or withdraw it if he wants but under cross-examination.    And then he must explain why he – he under oathto God had said two different things.    That is exactly the purpose of cross-examination.  Number 2 Chair.  The – I must just clarify something.  Mr Moyane said in his affidavit and in case again I am – he is saying it through me.  Mr Moyane said in his affidavit he is willing to come and testify here.  So this notion that he is – he must come and talk about the air force and what what he is prepared to come here.  But that is a completely separate transaction.  That has nothing to do with his right to cross-examine Mr Gordhan.  So Mr Moyane can come and testify and assist the commission and that will take its own course but right now he is busy with one thing and one thing only to apply to cross-examine Mr Gordhan insofar as Mr Gordhan has testified.  So whether Mr Moyane was going to testify or not testify his rights or his entitlement to that cross-examination is untouched.  The next issue Chair is that the – MrMoyane’s version there is this thing about Mr Moyane’s version.  Mr Moyane’s version is there Chairperson.  There is nothing for him to come and     No, no.  No Chair. Yes that – that.    Chairperson but he puts it very clearly in the supplementary affidavit page 265.    Page 265 he says?  Remember this whole debatecomes from the supplementary affidavit and the Chair in your ruling you actually made it clear.  Because at first you said well he did not clarify this.  And then in his supplementary affidavit he then – which is what sparked the Chair to give this ruling.    My version is of course that I was not justified but duty-bound to act as I did and that any reasonable SARS Commissioner in the same position would have done the same.  It is therefore my strong case that Gordhan’s evidence led before this commission whichimplicates me in any wrongdoing must be viewed against this background and declared to be false, unconceived and very far from being objective or credible.  It must accordingly be rejected.  I will elaborate further on this aspect when I testify.     Hm.    Yes.    Was assisted.    Fair enough Chair.    No.  I - I accept that one cannot just put a boiled …    But I am saying Chair if you go to paragraphs 13, 14, 15, 16 of Mr - 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 of Mr Moyane’s supplementary    It gives you the version.    He says what I have just said and then says   “…in the answer is freely available in the court …”    “I wish to draw specific attention to two documents referred to the Sikhakhane Panel …”    “…and the I - IGI report …”    And then it says   So the version is here.    There is no need a, to give Mr Gordhan another opportunity to clarify what is clear …    Anyway I am the same person Chair.  The understanding - you just have to read.  Even a two year child will - will read the affidavit and says I do say he was motivated by State Capture.    It is not a question of understanding.    Yes, yes.    It is - it is - clear is an understatement Chair.  If a man says I do say he was motivated by State Capture …    In laying the charges.    What more …CHAIRPERSON   Needs to be clarified really?    What more Chair?    Otherwise we will be clarifying here forever.    Remember that is why you asked for clarification.    In - as I said earlier Chair.    In my submission even …    But let us - let us for a moment say there was.    That equivocation was clarified beyond any doubt by Mr Gordhan …    Under oath in an affidavit.    If there was equivocation.  The one way the other.CHAIRPERSON   So there is nobody who can stand here now and say that …    He is not saying what he said and as I say if - if indeed that is so …    He is guilty of perjury.  Actually if he comes with another affidavit …    That says the opposite of this.    We will go and lay criminal charges of perjury.    Because he will be lying …CHAIRPERSON   Because he said - he did say here …    Clearly what is; last point Chair.    The - the question - this - this thing about Judge Nugent I want to elaborate on it because the Chair has correctly pointed out that …    You are not bound by whatever Judge Nugent said…    But even - even on Mr Gordhan’s version …    Chair he says no more than that.  He - he says what we now know …    In other words now in May whenever he signed that thing.    Is that Justice Nugent said this and that and the other.    So that is completely irrelevant.    When he was sitting here …    When - when the Judge gave the - the …    He says that in his own words but again on this thing of selective reading.  This is what Mr Gordhan - Mr Nugent said at 243. “I have not yet found why the creation and the - notyet - why the creation and existence of the unit was said to be unlawful, which is how it was consistently uncritically depicted.  I find no reason why the establishment of the unit was indeed unlawful, and I am supported by the opinion of …; as far as I am aware that opinion was never publically disclosed.”    And if there was an unlawfulness it should be referred …    Yes.    Of the report.    Huh-uh.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Is this, yes.    To do this and that.    Well Chair …    Well Chair I will bother you with it a little bit.  This    Do an analysis …    But put that aside.    In the IGI report it says   There is no doubt about that, ja …    And - and that is the first thing.    The Public Protector also says the same thing andit is not true …    I have to say this.  No, no, no I have to say …    Well and so - unless …    Only accepted so far as they rely on it.    Yes.    Yes.    No man.  No Chair.    It cannot be.  The lawfulness it is - if - Mr Moyane wants to a lay a charge about something that was perfectly lawful that is one thing …    But if he wants to lay a charge about somethingthat was a criminal activity.  That is another thing.  So it is not irrelevant.  So …    Turned out to be … CHAIRPERSON   Hm.    Hm.    True but if …    If he had grounds to - if he saw him shooting somebody and went to a police station then you cannot say he ismotivated by malice.  That is the point I am making.    So - so if indeed there was criminal activity or unlawful activity and on the basis of that he went to the police how he can you say he is motivated by malice.  So it goes to the very nub of the question.    A place.    Hm.    Hm. CHAIRPERSON   Yes.    Yes.    State Capture.    Fair enough.    The - the notion - going back to Mr Moyane’s state of mind it is also not true - well fortunately it was withdrawn to say that the Public Protector’s report is discredited.    Sikhakhane’s report is also not discredited.    The fact that Justice Nugent says …    Is - that is his problem.    It has got nothing - it is not a discredit … CHAIRPERSON   Justice Nugent was not sitting as a review …    Or an Appeal Court of Sikhakhane.    Sikhakhane stands as we stand now.    Nobody …    Not even …CHAIRPERSON   Mr Gordhan has ever …    Reviewed the Sikhakhane report.    So it stands.    Right?  Kroon.    The Kroon - Justice - Judge Kroon’s judgment …CHAIRPERSON   I have said this before when I was here.    It is a fallacy to say that it was withdrawn.    He went to the Nugent report - Commission …    And he withdraw his support …    For the report.    Of the seven people.    And let us say Justice Kroon voted against …    And the other six voted for.    The report still stands.    So this notion that the Kroon report is discreditedis also …    Completely a fallacy.    The IGI report says the must be charged criminally.  It has never been challenged.    So all the four reports - I am excluding the Public Protector.    That Mr Moyane had access to - I say the same and the only report on the other side is one which did not investigate the issue.    Which deals with it tangentially …CHAIRPERSON   And which says that it will not be diverted …    To looking at it.  So all in all there is no …    There is no report that - that finds the -the rogue unit lawful.  At best if you twist the language you will say there is one out of six or seven.    The - the …    Yes.  Okay, Chair.    I - I - can I just say one thing.    Otherwise my attorney will fire me.    That - Chair this notion of dragging this thing and further opportunities and endless …    Will only add to the notion of that Mr Gordhan is untouchable …    And is not treated like other witnesses or that he should be cross-examined.  Let him come and face the music and do his own clarification here.    Hm.CHAIRPERSON   Hm.    Thank you Chair. CHAIRPERSON   Thank you very much.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you very much Chair. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Morning Chair I appear for… CHAIRPERSON   For Minister Gordhan in this application and place on record my gratitude for the timing of the application this morning.  Thank you.    In …    Indeed.    And Chair let me start with - with the preliminary framing submission and then a summary of where I think the debate has gotten to this morning and …    The first point that has to be made and stressed again is that Minister Gordhan agrees that no one is beyond scrutiny and he has nothing to hide and if it will assist the Commission and if you determine that it is necessary and in the interest of the function of the Commission that he returned to be cross-examined he will obviously make himself available. His opposition to this application on legal advice is not to be understood as anything but that and he is entirely supportive of the work of the Commission and consistent with its rules.  Is willing to make himself available if that is what you - you rule of course.  So there is no basis on which to claim that he is somehow subject to other rules.He is entirely prepared to come back and assist the Commission if that is what you - what you would like.  The debate this morning also demonstrates that under the title of malice this application is in fact trying to get you to undo what you have already ruled and I will take you to your ruling and what was - what was before you at that point in time to demonstrate that because …    Yes.    Yes of course.CHAIRPERSON   Yes.  Thank you. CHAIRPERSON   But Chair the - the point is that Minister Gordhan is not saying anything new in his clarificatory affidavit.  He has …    Hm.      So let me ...[intervenes]      Yes.     He says I do not know why he laid those charges.     Those charges were then picked up by the Hawks and by the NPA to do 27 questions and bring in withdrawalcriminal charges against me and that component of it was the politi – part of the campaign to try to force me out.     And that is what he clarifies in his affidavit.     So he only ever repeats Mr Moyane was the origin of the complaint that was then picked up and used by Law Enforcement Agencies, first the Hawks, then the NPA, in the campaign.     That is why he says I do not know why he did that, so on the charges question, which is the only issue that is still remaining for decision, Minister Gordhan has said, and has only ever said Mr Moyane was the person who did that.     That complaint was then used in the campaign, and he does not say Mr Moyane was part of 27 questions or charges because he does not have any information to that effect.     Where he dealt with Mr Moyane otherwise in his evidence was to say from the moment he was appointed SARS Commissioner he resisted my authority, and then did things at SARSthat made no sense to me and now makes sense if you understand them in terms of State Capture, and in your ruling you went through all of that and dismissed the application on all of those other topics.  What you are being asked to do today is revisit that application and permit that cross-examination which you have previously disallowed.     Indeed Chair.  So if we look Mr Moyane’s – sorry Minister Gordhan’s clarificatory affidavit under the heading where he is trying to recap his evidence before the Commission and show that it is Mr Moyane who introduces this idea of malice and poses the question of whether you should entertain the debate about what was in his head when he laid the complaint, Minister Gordhan says my evidence – and this is paragraph 10 of his clarificatory affidavit, it     Then when he – then paragraph 12 he takes you back to his evidence before you, and the only time he mentioned Mr Moyane in relation to the charges was when he testified and he quotes it, the envelope containing 27 questions addressed to me from the Hawks demanding that they be answered by 2 March 2016, the questions related to the high risk investigation unit within SARS formed years earlier.   Charges against me relating to that unit had been filed by Moyane on 15 May 2015.  Again it is a factual recording that Moyane was the individual who laid the charges.     Yes Chair, because what ...[intervenes]      Yes Chair, so what Mr Minister Gordhan has said to this Commission in his evidence and in all of his affidavits is Mr Moyane’s dismantling of SARS and his resistance to my authority appears to serve the State Capture agenda.     With respect to charges Minister Gordhan has only ever said I do not know what was in his head, and I do not think – and he has said to you that he does not believe that it would assist the Commission for you to try to make a finding on that.     He has only ever said Mr Moyane was the person who filed the charges.  So the State Capture part of any of the allegation is to say at the time I had this relationship that where he was resisting my authority, he took decisions and took action at SARS that dismantled and undermined that organisation and I am bolstered in my belief now knowing what Justice Nugent has found.     Chair I have two things to say about that, the first is that you are with respect entirely correct that the decision can be taken today on the outstanding issue that hangs over from the earlier application, this question of malice, and it can be dismissed, soyou can decide on the basis of what you have before you already that this residual issue that was left over for argument, and further clarificatory affidavits and submissions can now be decided and decided in a way that dismisses the application because all Minister Gordhan has ever said is Tom Moyane was the origin of a criminal complaint that was then used in a subsequent complaint – campaign by other people, the Hawks and the NPA.So there is no basis on which Mr Moyane cross-examining Minister Gordhan helps you because that issue is now decided.     Precisely Chair.        So he says the laying of charges is only – the only reference that Minister Gordhan makes to the laying of charges is to say how it subsequently picked up by other entities in the     That’s all he says.  In the clarificatory affidavit where he recaps his evidence about the attack on Treasury and the attempt to capture Treasury and what Mr Moyane did at SARS he is trying to respond to the Chair’s direction that said are you saying that there was another – there was something else going on and he says it is my personal belief that Tom Moyane played a role in the capture project based on what he did at SARS, which has nothing to do with charges.     It has – it is nothing new because that’s what he testified about already and in your ruling you went through all of those themes that they hoped to cross-examine on Minister Gordhan and State Capture, SARS and State Capture, the high risk investigation unit and capture and you dismissed all of those themes and topics so you have already decided that the other is not going to be the basis for cross-examination, certainly not without a version from Mr Moyane.     So he – yes – he may well, should not have bothered in going further but as I have explained it was trying to –     He thought that the direction invited Minister Gordhan to address the laying of charges issue, which he did, and then where the direction said what was – what are you saying about Mr Moyane’s role in the State Capture and then he clarified again the part that he – but the critical point for today’s purposes is that you have already considered that other aspect and rejected the application. You had already decided in your earlier ruling that it does not assist the work of the Commission to have Mr Moyane’s legal team cross-examine my client about why he believes the Nugent Commission, which is essentially what the exercise would be, so he is already explained and in your ruling if we – you know it starts at 42 and continues through the ruling until we – and it goes all the way through the various themes until we get to paragraph 67, that is where in – from paragraph 42 all the way to 67 is where your ruling dealt with the unitnarrative, the findings of the Nugent Commission and you determined that it was  not going to assist the work of the Commission to have cross-examination on that question.     And Chair ...[intervenes]      No but Chair I absolutely, with respect I absolutely agree with you.     Because for the Commission – the Commission absolutely needs to hear more about how Mr Moyane was, or was not, part of the State Capture project.     But it must hear it from Mr Moyane.     It must be a version from Mr Moyane that     Deals with his time at Correctional Services where he was mentioned in relation to the Bosasa payments, deals with his role in the Waterkloof landing, that has also been handled by the Commission.     So there is a version from Mr Moyane that would assist the work of the Commission.     It is not by cross-examining Mr Gordhanon his beliefs based on the Nugent Commission.     Indeed.     Chair Minister Gordhan has always said precisely that.       He has only ever said Mr Moyane was the origin of what turned into a campaign.     He has already provide to the Commission relying on Nugent and relying on the evidence he gave you already about his personal experience of what Mr Moyane did as soon as he arrived as SARS Commissioner, to say this seemed to be a part of the State Capture Project. So I will obviously take instructions, but I am not sure Minister Gordhan will have further information to help you.But that is the critical point.  It is time for Mr Moyane to tell you and to tell the country why – what he did at SARS was not part of state capture.    Because he never went to Nugent and explained it    He has never despite promising you thelast time we were here that at – a review of Nugent would be launched imminently it has never happened.    And now he want to come to this commission and try to rerun the same arguments, the same themes, the old narratives that are being used outside of this room to try to discredit my client in a political campaign. And that is Public Protector Reports and IGI Reports and the like.      And the question for the commission when it receives Mr Moyane’s version is whether it will be useful for Minister Gordhan to return on that basis.    But for purposes of today.    So that it is very, very clear.    If you would like a paragraph that says I have only ever said …    He was the origin of the charges.    Not what Nugent says.  Not in relation to the laying of charges.    We could – we could do that.  Because that would close off this application and if would mean that once Mr Moyane finally takes the country into his confidence and says This is what was actually going on when I was doing what I was doing.     And obviously you would have to decide if you can entertain that evidence given that you are not sitting as a    Presumably he may…    Say something about Minister Gordhan and we could have a further application then.    Of course.    No of course.    Chair if I could then just briefly correct – correct one factual error made by my friend in his submissions.    Because it is important for the record.  So Mr Mpofu submitted to you that there was no way when he was – when he was arguing to you the – that Minister Gordhan could not possibly have relied on the Nugent Reports when he made – when he said thatthis is why I believe there is no rogue unit and he made that finding.  Let us just recall what was in fact going on there.  So the allegation against Minister Gordhan has only ever related to his role in the establishment of the unit.  That is when he was still SARS Commissioner.  He then became Minister of Finance for the first time and as has been clear in the Public Protector Review that is pending never played any role in the functional operation of the unit.  He has only ever been said to have played role in its establishment.      In Judge Nugent’s interim report which isdated the 27 September 2018 which is before Minister Gordhan comes    So he is perfectly entitled to say I am – my ground, my belief on the Nugent finding that Justice Nugent could not find why the establishment of the unit was unlawful.  And this – this – it is also something that I do have to put on the record precisely becausemy learned friend astutely recognised that this commission is something that the public is watching.  That the country is looking at.  And it is to say that the attempt to try to introduce into these proceedings the full narrative around the investigation unit at SARS.  Not only does it fall outside of your terms of reference but it runs the risk of this commission losing its credibility and being captured itself when it is used as a platform to run this narrative.  Because my learned friend stood before you…    Yes Chair so let me be clear what I am saying.    Indeed.  But let us be clear what thesubmission is – what the position is.  The position is the same…    Yes.    But Chair…    Chair we must keep two things very clear and distinct in looking at this question.  The only reason why Minister Gordhan references the Nugent Commission is to explain to you the basis of Minister Gordhan’s personal belief about what went on under Tom Moyane’s reign at SARS.    A sep – an entirely separate question in which the evidence of Mr Moyane not the evidence of Minister Gordhan because he has already given you everything he has on this topic.    Is to say was what went on at SARS part ofstate capture.     So those are two very different points again.  Minister Gordhan only references the Nugent findings to say that is why I believe.    That my involvement in the establishment of the unit was lawful and why all of this narrative that gets repeated and repeated and now is used in Public Protector Reports and hate speech proceedings and outside and political rallies is because of –there is a campaign against me that began when I when I was reappointed as Minister of Finance and continues to this day.  I mean there is a certain opposition party in this country that seems to make weekly media statements about my client.  So it is a narrative that is getting perpetuated outside.  That is all that Minister Gordhan says about it and why he references the Nugent Commission.  We – it has never been our submission.    That you should not look at Tom Moyane and state capture.  That has never been the submission.    And Chair it is – it is – I mean obviously it is useful – so again let me – let me try one more time to explain why these are two different points.  What went on at SARS under MrMoyane and the role that this narrative has played in our politics and the way that it is used by the proponents and beneficiaries or state capture and corruption at National and Local Government level is an issue that this commission may well be interested in investigating and it probably falls under your term of reference that deals with the relationship between procurement and the state.    And investigating Mr Moyane and him coming to up a version and testify and be cross-examined would    It is not to allow Mr Moyane to cross-examine Minister Gordhan.    Where he has only ever given you that second hand information.    And that is the critical point.    So – yes the – the – and I must just again because my learned friend put it all on the record I must be given the opportunity to rebut it.  He takes you through KPMG, Sikhakhane, Kroon, Public Protector.  Each one of those legs on which Mr Moyane may well rely have been destroyed.  They have been discredited.  The Public Protector Reports are on review and they have not yet beendetermined but there is a serious legal challenge to all of them.  Unlike the promised review of Nugent by Mr Moyane.    KPMG has withdrawn….    Chair if I could just complete the point?    Yes.    Well it has been – let me say it has been – is the base – it is currently under a serious legal challenge that will be decided in due course.    I withdraw the discredit.    I withdraw that.  So the legs that Mister Mpofu referred to Sikhakhane Report said I find that the unit was established unlawfully.  Judge Nugent says and I have read to it I find no basis for saying that.  Judge Nugent has discredited that leg.    KPMG – KPMG has withdrawn its report.CHAIRPERSON   The Sunday Times has withdrawn its articles and apologised. Judge Kroon has disavowed his statements in his evidence before Judge Nugent and apologised to the members of the unit.  Today we are heartened when we see media reports that say that the new SARS Commissioner is re-establishing this capacity and implementing the recommendations of the Nugent Report.    So the commission you will have to decide whether allowing one more repetition of a narrative that is only servinga political campaign and is not actually getting you to the truth of what happened should be entertained.  That is not for Minister Gordhan to – to debate.      So the question is simply if Mr Moyane were to come and give you a version on what happened at SARS.    On what happened on the Waterkloof landing.    On what happened at – with the Bosasa payments.    As he – as his name was mentioned.  That    But that then means Minister Gordhan may well be back but it is in response to a version finally from Mr Moyane.  So this application we submit there are – there are really only – there is really only one outcome here given where we are which is to dismiss this residual issue.    Get a full version from Mr Moyane on all of the things he could possibly assist this commission with and then we will see where we stand. And perhaps when he puts that version up hementions my client and the commission will engage with us and we will obviously assist the commission as much as we can as Minister Gordhan has to date.     And that is – that may well be where we end up on this.    And Chair the – ja – let me – unless there are further questions I think that is where I should…    I should leave it.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Not within your terms of reference.    That is the point to which I would now like to move.    Chair because both are possible he could have acted with reasonable cause, he could have acted without reasonable cause. The issue for determination whether in the terms of reference is the allegation as to whether that was part of the statecapture project or not.  Malice is a label that is placed on the conduct but it is the underlying conduct of course that is important rather than the label which is given to it or it is categorisation although it may become legally relevant at a later stage.  But may I just put to you Chair that there is at the very least uncertainty and confusion about who is saying what.  At page 8 of your papers     Minister Gordhan says in paragraph 12 in that quote “Charges against me relating to that unit had beenfiled by Mr Moyane.”    So it seems what Minister Gordhan subject to clarification and I will come back to that point might be saying is that the laying of charges was part of a campaign of state capture.    It is further clarified in paragraph 31 on page 14 where he says in paragraph 31 “Considering my interactions with Mr Moyane over this period and the subsequent findings in theNugent Inquiry my personal belief remains and I emphasise the word remains that Mr Moyane abused his position as the former SARS Commissioner to institute criminal proceedings against me and others since there was no reasonable basis for him to do so.”    Finally to paragraph 22.4 Minister Gordhan says   And then he says quite clearly inparagraph 22.5 “I believe that Mr Moyane’s personal goals while he was SARS Commissioner included the advancement of the state capture project.”    So leave aside all that at the very least one can say there is confusion about what Mr Gordhan     Is saying about Mr Moyane.    But the purpose of cross-   Not only to challenge but it is also to clarify.    Of course that same object may be achieved from a statement of clarification by Minister Gordhan but that is a decision you will make Chair.  If I may just raise another issue?  Of course these issues are dealt with in a number of other fora and by a number of other instances.    After clarification. CHAIRPERSON   Or otherwise.    Correct.  Correct Chair.  That might alleviate the difficulties.    That arise out of taking all these issues.    Further.  Then Chair you raised theissue of narrowing the issue into manageable proportions.    Given the real constraints of time and resources.    Under which we operate. And Chair may I suggest that the formulation on page 1 of your communication to the parties of the 6 May 2019. “1a. In laying the charges against Mr Gordhan and others was Mr Moyane motivated wholly or in part orhe sought to advance the objectives of state capture.”    That really is the crisp issue.    Finally just a comment on the point raised about you having made a ruling and therefore not entitled to make any further ruling.  It seems clear Chair that in the light of the further statements put before you at the very least you are free to make a ruling and in fact obliged to make a ruling to clarify any uncertainty.  Whether by cross-examination or otherwise. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good Morning Mr Chairman.    Yes thank you, Mr Chairman this morning we intended to lead the evidence of Lieutenant General Matakata, whois present today, she is represented by Mr Maringa and Mr Jonas is represented by Miss Ndagula, they are present.    Chair the only difficulty we’ve encountered    On record yes Chair.    There is a transcript Chair which I asked the registrar to place before you, it was apparent from that transcript that there was some confusion about what happened when General Nonopi [?]withdrew her application to cross-examine Mr Jonas and Chair does deal with that together with Mr Jonas and Mr Jonas’ lawyer and they made it very clear that they thought that because it was withdrawn and then they – that was their understanding that everythingwas – appeared to have been withdrawn and they deal with that Chair at page 80 of that record and then Mr Mokoena also confirms to you Chair in the very last sentence and he says,“He withdrew his application before this Commission to cross-examine so he never dealt with it”,Yes, so clearly Mr Jonas never dealt with the affidavit of Miss Nonopi and that – of General Nonopi and that of General Matakata.  There are quite some critical matters especially those that relate to General Matakata, Chair will recall that there is a letter that was written to Parliament so those are matters that have not really been – they are slightly canvassed in the re-examination of Mr Jonas by Mr Louw but they do not really deal with everything that is contained in those.  I think also due to pressure and in terms of time factors which Mr Louw does deal with in response to the Chair.    No Chair I did explain – we explained to both of them Chair.    As we also explained in the presence of    Yes thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Will do so Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair, may I also be excused Chair? 
ADV LIPU NDAGULA:  Chairperson my name is Lipu Ndagula and we are representing Mr Jonas. 
ADV MARINGA JOWEL:  Chair I’m Maringa Jowel from Maringa Attorneys in Pretoria I’m representing Lieutenant General Matakata. 
GENERAL YOLISA MATAKATA:  Yes Chair I understand thank you. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Good morning Chair.    That is correct, Chair regarding point M, sale of vehicles, the heading, New World Motors, Chair from point or paragraph 195 to paragraph 201, Chair all that is here in my statement hinges on what I believe or assume how thesystem was abused with regards to the tender process so I would not speak on this in detail but I’m willing to help the investigation team with their investigations regarding this matter.    Chair yes, if I can just give the background as to my own involvement in this transaction, I was given an instruction, this was probably in July 2010 Chair by General Lazarus to go to General Mdluli’s house in Vosloorus to pick up his BMW, his private vehicle at that stage, 730 diesel and I must take the vehicle to Nissan Atlantis.  This I carried out Chair, I indeed did this and handed the vehicle over to Mr Jan Venter at Nissan Atlantis.  Chairafter about two weeks I …[intervenes].    At that stage, no Chair.    Chair that is correct, I believe that Mr Venter – or arrangements rather had been made with Mr Venter to receive this car, this particular vehicle as, like I mentioned when I picked up the vehicle from General Mdluli’s house and subsequently dropped it off with Mr Venter he did not ask me any questions or who does this vehicle belong to, so it’s my belief that arrangements was made and I handed the keys over to him and I left.    That’s correct.    And I dealt with a gentleman by the name of Mr Nico Visser, he was actually one of the sales persons at Leo Haese.      Nico Visser.CHAIRPERSON   That’s correct Chair.  The reason Colonel Barnard gave me – regarding picking up the vehicle from Mr Venter and taking it to this particular dealership is that Mr Venter was battling to get a decent price or they were struggling to sell this particular vehicle at Nissan Atlantis, that was the reason that was told to me and I’m referring now to Mr Visser of Leo Haese.  After me taking the vehicle to    That is correct Chair.      Mr Venter being the dealer principal of Atlantis Nissan and Mr Nico Visser being the sales person at Leo Haese BMW.  Mr Visser did an appraisal Chair and he informed me that the windscreen was cracked and he suggested to me that the windscreen be replaced or should be replaced as this would affect the value of the vehicle.  Chair I’m not sure if this was ever done, I can’t recall.      What I can say thoughis General Mdluli’s private BMW was eventually sold, I say this because Colonel Barnard asked me to make contact with General Mdluli because the sales person, Mr Nico Visser wanted a spare key.      The spare key Chair, I believe those keys are quite expensive.    So he wanted a spare key.  I contacted General Mdluli Chair and I managed to obtain the spare key from him, I also recall when he handed over the key to me,and I’m referring to Genera Mdluli, he remarked or said something to the effect that, I’m giving you the key and I’m getting nothing in return.  This was quite light hearted Chair it was almost [indistinct].      I then relayed this message to General Lazarus, also light hearted on my side and General Lazarus, I remember him saying, does he know how much we spent to sort out his car, this is what General Lazarus said referring to General Mdluli.    Does he know how much we spent to sort out his car.    That’s correct Chair.    I’ll speak about that in my next – in the next paragraph Chair.    No Chair.    And I’m speaking about the same meeting or the same conversation that I had with General Lazarus, he had a page on his desk Chair, it was a few figures written,I think it was three different figures that he showed me and he told me – he gave me the page and he told me to go and show it to General Mdluli to show him how much they spent to sort out the said vehicle, the transaction or rather the shortfall.  Chair I did not show General Mdluli this page that was given to me by General Lazarus, I shredded the document Chair.     Chair if I can continue?    After I collected the key from General Mdluli I went over to Leo Haese and this handed this key to Mr Visser.  Chair after this transaction concluded or was concluded General Lazarus told me that I must organise or make arrangements for a loan agreement to be drawn up between Mr Jan Venter of Nissan Atlantis and General Mdluli, the reason given to me by General Lazaruswas that there was a shortfall of R50 000 on the transaction on General Mdluli’s private BMW.  Chair at this stage I do not know why the instruction was given to me to draw up an agreement between Mr Visser of Atlantis Motors and General Mdluli because the vehicle was actually sold through BMW, Leo Haese.  So at this stage I don’t know why this instruction was given to me, however, I can say that the document was drawn up Chair, there were three different documents Chair.  I’ll now refer to the first one, I’m referring now to the acknowledgment of debt between General Mdluli and Mr Jan Venter of    Chair during the – or rather let me go back regarding the acknowledgment of debt, I think this was about, around July 2010 where I went to Mr Venter on the instruction of General Lazarus and asked him to have a loan agreement drawn up between himself and General Mdluli regarding the R50 000 as I explained to you previously.  This is now the first document I refer to, I said there were three different documents Chair and I refer to the acknowledgment of debt, this is the first one I referred to.    Now I speak on the second – rather the first one again, the document was indeed drawn up by General – or rather Mr Venter but at that stage Chair, it was not signed.  So basically there was no legality to that document because neither Mr Venter of Atlantis Motors nor General Mdluli had signed thatdocument, however, what I can say regarding the first one, the first acknowledgement of debt, during late 2010 General Lazarus reminded me or asked me – this is now when Crime Intelligence got wind of the Hawks investigation into General Mdluli’s activities.  General Lazarus reminded me Chair of the agreement that was initially drawn up which I had actually forgotten about because it was a few months later but after having checked in my bag and looking for it Chair, I indeed found this document and like I said it was not signed.  I then showed this document to General Lazarus, he instructed me to get it signed by Mr Venter and General Mdluli which I subsequently did and after thedocument was signed I’m not sure if I gave it to Mr Venter or I kept in my bag with me, I can’t recall exactly.     I’m just going to refer to    Chair I don’t see that document here I’m not sure that document is not here there’s two other documents which I refer to as acknowledgment of debt, there was three I said I don’t see the first one.    This is – it could be with    Chair I – this is now the first document that I referred to, I now go to…[intervenes].     Chair it’s not in the bundle.    Chair it’s not in the bundle.    The Annexure, this is the    Chair this was when – this was a period, it would have been probably between June 2011 to October 2011.  This was a period when General Mdluli was suspended Chair.  Chair on paragraph 210 I’d just like to clarify something, it reads,“Subsequent to General Mdluli’s suspension on the  instruction of General Lazarus I went to General Mdluli”.Chair that is incorrect, General Mdluli via another memberfrom CI made contact and requested that I see him. So this was not the instruction of General Lazarus this was a request by General Mdluli for me to make contact and to see him but I did inform General Lazarus of the request and he then allowed me to meet with General Mdluli.  So he basically had knowledge of this meeting.  Chair I then met – made arrangements to meet with General Mdluli, I think it was the Nando’s we met in the carpark in the Nando’s, the Boksburg area, he handed me a handwritten document and instructed me to take that document to Mr Venter which I did.  Chair I refer to the third document as Annexure 119    I showed this document  118, I showed this document that I picked up from General Mdluli and I showed it to Mr Venter.  He had a look at it and he told me that he will draw up a new agreement, this is now referred to the third acknowledgment of debt on page 119 Chair.  Chair when this document, and I refer to the third one, when it was ready I got a call from Mr Venter, he told me that he had the documents prepared.  I wentto his dealership in Centurion, I picked up that document, I made arrangements to meet General Mdluli again at the carpark at Nando’s in Boksburg.  He signed this document Chair, I took it back to Mr Venter, he had it signed – or he signed the document and I subsequently made arrangements with General Mdluli’s son to meet me at the Total garage in Centurion and I handed over this document to him, this is now the third one Chair, I refer to the third acknowledgment of debt.    Chair in April 2011 I wason leave I had undergone an operation I was off work for three months.  I was visited by three members of the Asset for Future Unit, they explained to me that they were investigating some activities regarding General Mdluli more especially the vehicles.  Chair I had a discussion – they requested an affidavit from me, I explained to them that I was on leave and at that stage I couldn’t give them an affidavit until I got permission from my superiors.  On that same day Chair, I went to – while I was on leave, I drove to Pretoria to General Lazarus’ office and explained to him that these three individuals or rather the visit of these three individuals to my house and requesting an affidavit from me.  Chair it’s then that General Lazarus informed me that General Mdluli’s private BMW had eventually been sold or trading-in when CI purchased two BMW’s to offset the shortfall on General Mdluli’s private vehicle.      Chair for the purposesof explaining it, if I may, let’s not call it a trade-in I’ll get to that in a moment.  Let’s just say that General Mdluli sold his car or his vehicle to Leo Haese.  So basically he took this vehicle, it was appraised and there was a shortfall of R90 000 if I can remember correctly, R90 000 some change.  So there was no trade-in, so in effect if that vehicle was purchased by Leo Haese and General Mdluli was in debt because they would have settled the car because there was an outstanding hire purchase on this vehicle so he would have owed – either owed Leo Haese R90 526.01 or he had to settle the hire purchase on his vehicle.  I’m not sure how that would have unfolded but eventually whathappened, now we call it a trade-in because what happened was CI eventually bought two vehicles, namely a BMW 330 diesel and a BMW 530 diesel, both were 2010 models basically – now I’m saying this is a trade-in because these vehicles basically were bought Chair to offset     Chair how I’m given to understand this transaction if I can explain it, basically there was no need for CI to purchase these two vehicles.  They were purchased solely to offset the R90 000 that was owing on General Mdluli’s vehicle. So the loss actually was not only R90 000 to Crime Intelligence but also the purchase of these two vehicles, I’m not sure at this stage what their value was but that’s what would be the loss to Crime Intelligence it would be the value of these two vehicles and the R90 000 becausethis would have been – if CI had bought these vehicles purely for their use or in normal circumstances, that discount of R90 000 would have actually gone to Crime Intelligence.  In this case it went or rather offset the R90 000 that was owing on General Mdluli’s private BMW    Sure.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON     No Chair.    That is correct Chair.  Because an appraisal was done by Mr Nico Visser.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   No Chair.    Not at that stage Chair.    No.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair. CHAIRPERSON   That is indeed correct.    Chair it was – it was I do not have the exact amounts.    Because I do not have the documents but it was a 2010 BMW 330 Diesel and 2010 BMW 530    That is correct Chair.    Not at that stage I was not aware of it Chair.    No Chair.    That is what was told to me by General Lazarus Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair because those – like I said there was a shortfall on his private vehiclewhich was R90 526.01.    So these two vehicles that I mentioned basically offset the – or rather let me put it this way.  The two vehicles purchased by Crime Intelligence the R90 526.01 would have been a discount to Crime Intelligence.  Crime Intelligence did not get that discount Chair instead it was offset against the outstanding value or outstanding debt against General Mdluli’s private BMW.    That is correct Chair.    I do not have an idea Chair.  I am – I was not privy to that.    Chair I do not know how the deals took place but I believe so because the – and I refer back to the – to the discussion that I had with General Lazarus. He said those two vehicle were purchased to sort out the shortfall on General Mdluli’s vehicle.    Chair I am really not sure why because the vehicle was actually traded in at Leohaese or Leohaese and I do not know why that the acknowledgement of debt was    Chair the one – the one vehicle namely the 330 Diesel was handed over to FM24 for use.  FM24 is a close associate of General Mdluli and the other 530 Diesel was used by General Mdluli himself.  Chair I must add also at this stage General Mdluli already was – or already had two vehicles in his possession – state vehicles – SR vehicles.    That is correct Chair that was a BMW7 Series.    Chair that is why initiallyI said let us call it a sale.    As there was no trade-in because that is initially – that is what it was.  Because he was not buying another car.  He was basically selling the car off to Leohaese and that would have been the outstanding debt of R90 000.00.    And then I went to the second part and I say it eventually became a trade-in because there was a trade-in. Crime Intelligence bought two vehicles against that BMW and the outstanding amount was offset against the purchase or rather the purchase of these two vehicles offset the outstanding balance on General Mdluli’s car. So that is why I said initially we will call it a sale with no trade-in but it eventually  became a trade-in    Chair no the – no Chair the benefit was not to Crime Intelligence the benefit was for himself because he was selling his car and he still had to settle the debt of R90 000.00 some change.    He did not get any money out of it Chair.    And I refer back to – let me go back to where he – I will refer you to 206.    Rather paragraph 206.    Where I say I collected a spare key from General Mdluli and he remarked I am giving you the key and I am getting nothing in return.    Chair I am not sure how Iexplained it.    Chair there was – there was an outstanding balance of R90 000.00.    Ye Chair.    Yes Chair.  That is – as I explained that is how I understand this transaction that how it unfolded.    Sure.ADV SUSAN WENTZEL   That is correct.    That is indeed correct.    Chair if I may I have given statements to this regard to Colonel Roelofse.  He would probably have more insight in his investigations if that would help.    Yes Chair I purchased a vehicle – a private vehicle from Mr Jan Venter of Atlantis Nissan.  The discount that I received was R30 000.00.     My wife’s niece also purchased a vehicle.  She also received a discount of R30 000.00    Chair I approached General Lazarus this was probably in 2007 and I informed that I wanted to replace my wife’s car or trade it in.  General Lazarus then directed me to Colonel Barnard and see how he could help me.  Colonel Barnard then said to me that he would speak to Mr Venter to arrange a vehicle for me or if he could arrange a vehicle.  Chair what I can remember is that I did eventually or my wife eventually purchased a vehicle Honda Civic from the Honda dealership.  It is still within – the Honda dealership is – falls within the wing of Nissan Atlantis it is one of the dealerships that belongs to Nissan Atlantis.  It was a Honda Civic and the discount I received on this vehicle was R30 000.00.  Chair in the same process that I just explained my wife’s niece also purchased a vehicle from Nissan Atlantis and she also received approximately    Chair General Lazarus bought two VW Golfs, a Kia Picanto, a Honda CRV, a Nissan Murano, two quad bikes, a scooter and motor bike through Nissan Atlantis.  Chair I am not sure what the total discount that he would have received on all of these vehicles that I mentioned.      Yes Chair I recall an incident where General Mdluli asked me to fetch this vehicle from his house and take it to Nissan Atlantis for a service and also on another occasion there was – there was that rim was damaged and there was a few other things that needed attention on the vehicle.      The total – sorry Ms Wentzel.    Chair…    I contacted Colonel Barnard about the payment.  Colonel Barnard said that he will deal with it.  I am not sure I cannot say for certain that it was paid or if it was paid how it was paid.    Chair this was not aprivate purchase this was a vehicle that was bought and paid for by the Secret Service Account and subsequently I made use of this particular vehicle.  Chair if I can just give you some insight as to how this transaction came about?  Chair during 2011 at that stage I was driving a silver Golf GTI which was still in fairly good condition.  The kilometres were quite low.  It was probably around 40 000 kilometres and it was in good condition.  Chair around April or May 2011 I was in the company of Colonel FM11.  I remember it very clearly Chair because this was the period where I was off sick from work.  I had undergone an operation.  It was from the 1 March to the 1 June so Iwas at home. I remember Colonel FM11 picking me up from home.  We – I cannot recall where we were driving to but we were driving in the Boksburg area when we passed a dealership Chair.  S4 Auto when I noticed a Golf R32 for sale.  Chair I subsequently informed General Lazarus about the vehicle and indicated to him that I wanted to purchase or rather wanted CI to purchase the vehicle for me to be used as a SR vehicle.  Simply meaning Chair I wanted General Lazarus to replace this R32 or rather replace the Golf 6 that I have been driving at that stage with this particular vehicle that I mentioned which was the Golf R32.      Chair I am not sure if it was – it was still within this period that I was on leave or off sick.  Colonel FM11 drove to S4 Auto where I met with General Lazarus and FM12.  Chair we inspected the vehicle but that particular vehicle Chairwas not in very good condition so that vehicle was not purchased.    Although I informed or Colonel FM11 informed me that he would continue to look for that particular vehicle in another province.  He would speak to his contact in Durban to see if his contact could source one there.  Chair I am not sure of the time period but I can say that some stage later Colonel FM11 informed me that his contact in Durban had indeed managed to locate a Golf R32.  We made arrangements when I say we it was myself and FM11 we made arrangements to fly to Durban or I am not sure if wedrove to Durban or flew to Durban but his contact made arrangements for us to inspect this vehicle.  Chair the person that I refer to – the contact of FM11 I remember his name as Lalu.  I cannot remember or recall his surname chair.    Chair?    It is a man Chair.    He informed us that the owner wanted 240 000 for the Golf R32.  After inspecting the vehicle and - and seeing that it was - is - was quite - was quite in goodcondition.  It was actually in better condition than the one that we had seen earlier or a few months earlier at S4 Auto. We - I am not sure if it was me or Colonel FM11 told Lalu that we were interested and that he should speak to the owner and tell the owner to keep the vehicle for us and not to sell it.  Chair on my return to Pretoria I informed General Lazarus that FM11 and myself had seen this particular vehicle and that it was in good condition and it was in better condition than the one that we had seen previously and that I wanted it. Chair General Lazarus gave me the go ahead to purchase thevehicle.  With regards to how the purchase or how the transaction would - would unfold Chair.  He asked me to speak to Colonel Barnard.  At that stage Colonel Barnard was Head of the Procurement Section and he asked me to - to speak to him and see what the best way would    Chair before meeting with Colonel Barnard or having a conversation with Colonel Barnard I remember meeting with Colonel FM11.  Chair and I suggested to him that - to Colonel FM11 that we inflate the price of the vehicle by R40 000,00.  Seeing that the …    Yes.  40 000.    Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Chair, I suggested this to FM11 seeing that the previous - the previous vehicle that we had inspected in Johannesburg S4 Auto was selling for 280 000 and the vehicle that we inspected in Durban was in much better condition and it was 40 000 less. So this was my suggestion to - to FM11 to speak to Lalu and that he should speak to the owner and see if he can facilitate that for us.  I informed FM11 that I needed extra - the 40 000 extra to pay for some of the renovations that I was undertaking at that stage at myhouse.  Chair Colonel FM11 agreed to check with his contact Lalu to speak to the owner to see if this deal can - could indeed be negotiated. Chair FM11 subsequently informed me that he did speak - did speak to - to Lalu and the arrangement that we suggested to them could be facilitated.  Chair this would be done once the vehicle was sold and the owner was paid. Colonel FM11 or myself through Lalu would fetch the extra R40 000,00 in cash.    Chair, I had already previously spoken to Colonel Barnard as to how we would facilitate this deal.  Colonel Barnard informed me that we should - it should be done through Nissan Atlantis.  Chair at that stage Nissan Atlantis was a supplier to Company X. The arrangement was that Nissan Atlantis would pay for this vehicle at the full price of R280 000,00 and Company X would beinvoiced for this vehicle.  So basically what it means is on paper it shows that Company X bought the vehicle from Nissan Atlantis as to oppose to the real owner in Durban. Chair like I explained whilst this whole process was going on I also started renovations at my - at my house as my wife was going to leave work and we were going to start a business from our home.  I remember one afternoon whilst travelling from - from work General Lazarus was with me as I would normally - as he would normally travel with me. He - he asked me how the renovations were going and if Ihad enough money.  It is then I recall Chair that I told General Lazarus it was - I was going to use the money from the sale of the R32 to sort out the renovations.  General Lazarus was aware of this transaction Chair and my exact words to him were I am going to jack up the price of the 32 by 40. Simply meaning Chair, I was going to inflate the price of the R32 by R40 000,00.  Chair when I told General Lazarus this he was not upset or angry in anyway nor did he reprimand me in anyway.  In fact he nodded his head which indicated that he was okay with what I just told him.  Chair at a later stage FM11 and I went to Durban and met Lalu at a shopping centre. I cannot recall the name of the shopping centre.  When we arrived there I sat in the car Chair and told Colonel FM11 to go aheadand meet with Lalu.  On his return Colonel FM11 handed me a money bag and said it is sorted.  This I believe Chair was the money that was the - the inflated price of R40 000,00 on the initial - on the purchase of this specific vehicle. I did not open or count the money Chair.  I told FM11 that he must keep the money with him as he still needed to settle the outstanding modifications done to the car by Lalu.  There was some other stuff that was done Chair.  I think there was some modifications done to the exhaust and there was - the mags were replaced. I cannot recall exactly but eventually what happened Chairafter reconciling all of these payments there was 20 - R25 000,00 left over from the R40 000,00 Chair.    At that stage when Colonel FM11 was handing me over the - the cash of R25 000,00 he told me that his washing machine had packed up and that he needed to buy a washing machine.  Chair, I gave him R5 000,00 from that - from the - from the amount of 25 and the balance of R20 000,00 I used for the renovations to my house.    Chair if I may before I go there.  I must also state that it was not normal practice for Crime    Yes Chair.  Chair when General Mdluli was appointed in 2009 almost immediately Chair he was flying to Cape Town almost every week.  Initially I used to take - on instruction of General Lazarus I used to take an advance on my name.  Go to the airport and pay for the - for his flight and subsequently hand the air ticket to General Mdluli. Chair this was putting quite some pressure on me becausebasically this was almost every week that General Mdluli was either flying to Cape Town or he was flying somewhere but most of the trips I remember were to Cape Town.    Chair, I also recall booking flights for two individuals linked to General Mdluli.  Ms T Lyons and E K Lyons.  Chair at that stage Ms Lyons was General Mdluli’s girlfriend and E K Lyons was her sister.  Chair, I also made bookings for - for his two children whose names are known to me but I will notmention them.    Chair all of these - all of these bookings for flight tickets were paid out of the Secret Service Account.    Chair like I mentioned initially it was cash payments that I would take in advance and go and pay for these tickets …    Eventually arrangements were made to book tickets through Westville Company - Westville Travel - pardon me Chair.  I previously testified to Westville Travel and their role in - with regard to the flight tickets insofar as Crime Intelligence goes.  The process was that I would get an instruction from (intervenes).    Chair this was a contact of FM - FM08 Chair.  FM08 was previously based in KZN.  He was a    And he was transferred to - to Head Office.  So this was FM08’s contact.  He made use of this particular travel agent while he was based in Durban Chair.  So when FM08 relocated to Gauteng he was based at Head Office Crime Intelligence. We used this contact and I know this person by the name of Mahesh was introduced or - introduced to me by FM08.  So in terms of General Mdluli’s flights Chair whenever he wanted to fly an instruction of General Lazarus.  I would either get the details from General Mdlulihimself or via General Lazarus and I would make the bookings telephonically with Mahesh who is a travel agent at Westville Travel. Chair this was all done telephonically.  There was no paperwork for any of these flights …    Chair, I believe they would.    I - I believe they would    Hm.    Chair, I previously - previously testified to an incident where plans were made to - to destroy evidence regarding the air tickets.  Colonel Roelofse would have documents relating to this particular service provider - Westville    Yes Chair.  This was on 19 October 2011.  This was two days before I was admitted into the Witness Protection Program.    That is correct.    Yes Chair but more especially it would be regarding Crime Intelligence.    No Chair.    Yes Chair that is correct. I know of the following renovations that were carried out with Secret Service Account money.  Chair this was an instruction - on the instruction of General Lazarus.  Chair and I refer to paragraph 247.  Chair Nchwe who I previously - previously testified to receiving a vehicle from Crime Intelligence.  Chair she had a burglary at her house.  It was in Essexwold Chair in Bedfordview.  On - on the instruction of General Lazarus Chair electric fencing, security beams and an alarm system was installed. I personally know of this because I put in a claim on my name.  Chair again R40 000,00.    That is correct Chair.  I cannot say exactly but if the documents are shown to me I can confirmbut I know that I put in a claim for approximately R40 000,00.    Chair, I really do not know.  I think we - once the investigations are done maybe we will have more insight into these things.    Chair 248 - I am also aware of renovations carried out at the residence of General Mdluli in Dawn Park in Vosloorus.  Chair, he - this also on the instruction of General Lazarus.  He had a security overall by installing electric fencing, security beams and an alarm system, new electronic gates, cameras, burglar bars were also purchased. Chair this was paid out of the SSA.  I say this because I personally put in an amount totalling and it is not 40 000 Chair.   It is 0 000.    Yes.  Chair, I also refer to Annexure 13 an application for the - these - as I have mentioned in paragraph 248 for these renovations or - or security upgrades to be carried out.    Chair it is very, very unclear.  The copy is not very good but this was a document that was authored by myself.    Chair it is page 121.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Chair regarding what I have just testified to in paragraph 248.  It was an application for these upgrades to be carried out.    That is correct Chair.  This was to    His signature is on the bottom as being approved.  It was also signed by Colonel Rolebile (?) Chair.    Chair, I - I believe that there had to be some paperwork just to legitimise this particular    But having said that …    I do not know what the policy is regarding security upgrades.    I cannot be certain Chair.    That is fine Chair.  Yes Chair, I waspersonally involved in this transaction.I was informed by General Lazarus that we needed to do some upgrades at the Minister’s house.  Chair, I am not sure where this instruction came from but with regards to myself it came from General Lazarus to me. Chair this was to put up a boundary wall.  This was at the Minister’s house.    We are at 2-5 …  Chair, I was given instruction by General Lazarus.  Chair, I - I just want to correct this 2-5-1 and I am going to read it. “General Lazarus informed me that I received an - that he had received an instruction from General Mdluli who had received an instruction from Minister Mthethwa.” Chair, I - I am not sure about that.  I - I can say that I received an instruction from General Lazarus and he received aninstruction from General Mdluli.  This part I am not sure of.    No Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair …    That arrangements be made for the construction of a boundary wall Chair.  This was on the - for - or rather on the perimeter of - of the residence of Minister Nathi Mthethwa.Chair this was in KwaMbonambi in KwaZulu-Natal.    Chair, I know where the premises is because I had previously gone there.  We flew to - to KwaZulu-Natal Chair and I say we.  I refer to General Mdluli and myself.  He was having a meeting with Minister Mthethwa and I had - drove him there to this particular premises.    So I know where thepremises is.    Chair subsequently made on the instruction of General Lazarus I travelled with FM09 to the Minister’s property to meet with another agent.  Chair this is FM46.  This was the agent who was going to oversee this project at the Minister’s house.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   FM46 and I flew to Durban with FM09 …    To meet with FM46. CHAIRPERSON   Chair this was purely to familiarise FM46 as to where the property was and what needed to be done.    Chair, I am - I am not sure on this occasion.  General Lazarus accompanied us or on the second occasion but what I can say was when the project did start I remember having a conversation with General Mdluli and he said to me    Chair what I understood to be is that the Minister inquired from General Mdluli why we as in Crime Intelligence is taking so long with the project.  Chair, I informed General Lazarus about the conversation that I had with General Mdluli.  We made arrangements to fly to - to KwaZulu-Natal.  Drove to KwaMbonambi to meet with FM46.  This was myself, General Lazarus and FM09.Chair Minister Mthethwa’s - his concerns I would say was indeed correct because there was hardly any work done.  I think there were just a few trenches that were - that were dug.    That is - that - that is correct Chair because this - this trip came about - the conversation that I had with General Mdluli the Minister inquired from him why we - why the project was taking so long.  This trip that I undertook with General Lazarus and FM09 came about from the conversation that I had with General Mdluli regarding the - the delay in the project or the progress of the project.We flew to Durban.  Met with FM46 and as I said Chair indeed the - the progress was quite slow.  It was very slow in fact.  There was just a few trenches done.  In that conversation or in that meeting General Lazarus put pressure on FM46 to expedite the project.  Chair the arrangement for - for payment for this whole project at the Minister’s property I remember putting in three claims Chair. It was over a period of a few months.  I cannot remember the exact - the exact figure but it was just under R200 000,00.  If the claims are shown to me Chair, I can confirm that it is my signature …    Chair that money was paid for - for labour, building material and other related expenses that were needed.    Not so much travelling Chair because this was an agent.  He had a vehicle.  He was making use of an SR vehicle at that stage.  So there was no travelling cost.  Itwas purely building related costs.    The - the agent oversaw this project Chair.      Yes that is correct.    That is …    No Chair.  There were local …    That is correct Chair.  There were local - local contractors …  Hired to do this particular work.    Chair it was a perimeter - it should have been perimeter wall.  I am not certain Chair because Icannot comment because I - I did not go back to KwaMbonambi after this meeting that we had with the agent.  So I cannot say for certain.     Chair if I can remember correctly when you enter the premises there were two pillars on the entrance, and if I can recall correctly there was fencing Chair, wire    That is correct Chair.  Chair I referred to paragraph 253, I remember having a conversation with FM46, Chair this was around the time that preparations were undertaken for Mr Marimuthu’s birthday party in KZN.  Chair FM46 complained to me that the demands from Mr Marimuthu were increasing and that the bill was escalating.  This is the conversation that I had with FM46 Chair.     This is the conversationI can recall Chair with FM46.    Chair I also had a conversation with General Lazarus, I cannot remember the time period where he informed me that General Bheki Cele allowed him to usemoney from the Secret Service Account to pay for his attorney’s fees.  Chair this was a time when General Lazarus was being investigated by the Hawks.  At that stage General Mdluli was suspended.    Chair like I said I remember having a conversation with General Lazarus where he informed me General Bheki Cele allowed him to use money from the Secret Service account to pay for his attorneys fees.  Chair this was when the Hawks was investigating General Lazarus and at that stage General Bheki Cele was a National Commissioner.    That is correct Chair.     Yes Chair, like I testified to earlier in my statement or in my testimony it was probably around R100 000 Chair, I cannot be sure, it might be more than that, but like I said I will only confirm when the claims are shown to me.      Yes Chair in 2013 on behalf of the police I was a witness in the disciplinary proceedings of General Lazarus, Chair if I – of what I understand he was subsequently dismissed from the police.  Chair during that proceedings Chair I was accused or rather let me put it ...[intervenes]     Yes Chair, yes Chair, if I can remember correctly it was.    That is correct Chair. CHAIRPERSON   That is correct Chair.      It is a few matters that I have covered already in my testimony Chair.    I would believe Chair, I am not sure the actual, what was the actual outcome or the – on what grounds General Lazarus was dismissed, I do not have the detail.    No Chair.    I know that he was dismissed from the police Chair but I do not know the circumstances onwhich charges he was found guilty.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair ...[intervenes]      No I was not privy to that Chair.   I have not seen any document.     No Chair.    Yes Chair.     Chair I can’t remember reading the judgment Chair.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON Chair this is not regarding the actual transcript as per se in totality I would just like to speak on one aspect or incident that occurred during this proceedings Chair, so it’s not going to put me at a disadvantage…[intervenes].     Yes I understand Chair.    That is correct.   It’s not just a straightforward answer.  Chair when I was appointed at Crime Intelligence initially in 2002 over the next few years Chair I became quite close to General Lazarus and over the next further few years I became his close confidant, well established within his inner circle and to an extent involved in the web of corruption that he had already established. Chair I spoke of the relationship with Mr Marimuthu andGeneral Lazarus, how he came into the picture.  Chair when Mr Marimuthu or rather when General Lazarus established a relationship with Mr Marimuthu the abuse and the extravagance regarding the Secret Service Account just went to another level.  Chair all of these things started to affect me personally, knowing what was going on.  I remember two months before being place in witness protection, on two occasions I came home and my wife noticed that I was not myself and she asked me what was going on.  Chair without giving any detail I said there’s stuff that is going on at work which is not right and I don’t know     Chair I explained to my wife – my wife picked up that I was not myself and we had a discussion, Chair without giving any detail to my wife as to what exactly what is going on at work, I told her that there are things that are going on that is not right and I don’t know what to do about it.     Chair at that stage, if I remember correctly my wife told me that I need to speak out or I need to leave that unit and get a transfer.  Chair like I said I was well established within General Lazarus’ inner circle taking a transfer would not be an option for me at that stage, it would arouse suspicion as to why I’m transferring out of the unit.  So at that stage a transfer was not an option for me Chair and then this came around where I was interviewed by the Hawks on the 18 t h.  Chair like I testified to earlierwhatever questions were put to me on the 18 t h I answered all questions honestly but I was hesitant simply because I could not trust them because as I’ve testified to I’ve implicated numerous people, serious corruptions or allegations of corruption so I didn’t know if I could trust them.  Chair on the 18 t h after being interviewed by the Hawks [indistinct] and Roelofse and Colonel Viljoen I had another discussion with my wife and explained to her the events of the day and Chair it was actually my wife who convinced me – it was my wife who convinced me to come clean Chair and on the 19 t h of October, on my own accord I disclosed all the allegations of criminality taking place within CrimeIntelligence including myself.  Chair there was a version put forward that I only did this because I wanted a secure deal for myself to avoid prosecution.  Chair this is totally untrue, on the 19 t h I went there by myself, I didn’t have any legal representative, I made admissions     So this is totally untrue Chair, in fact after giving all of this information to Colonel Roelofse on the 19 t h, he was very frank and he was very honest with me, he said, you know I can’t say there’s nothing going to happen to you there’s no deal for you.  Chair, however, he said he will speak to the prosecutor and see what he can do.  Chair on the 25 t h of October 2011 this was my first, if I can call it my blanket affidavit which I deposed to, to Colonel Viljoen.  In that statement or affidavit, I did say that I would like to be     Chair that process still has to unfold in the Courts and a decision has to be made.  So the notion or suggestion that I only came forward with all of this to get a deal for myself to avoid prosecution is totally untrue Chair.     That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   That is correct. ADV SUSAN WENTZEL     That is correct Chair.     That is what I’m given to understand Chair.    That is correct.     That is correct Chair, over the two days of the 18 t h and the 19 t h Chair, there was no subpoena for me to present myself to the Hawks, I went there willingly, it was a request for me to be interviewed.  So there was no obligation on myself to present myself.      I went there willingly Chair.     And on the 19 t h as I explained having made the decision and settled within myself already the previous night that I was going to disclose all information that I was privy or had personal knowledge of regarding criminality within CrimeIntelligence, I’d already made that decision the previous night and still presented myself on the 19 t h without any legal representative, knowing well that I could have well be arrested myself, that is my position Chair.    Chair before I go there, if I can just say this as well.     My testimony has beenquite extensive I’ve touched on numerous incidents.    I’ve implicated numerous people, Chair insofar as where I was personally involved and had personal knowledge, Chair I’m prepared to avail myself for a polygraph test and for the results of that test be placed on record before this Commission.    Chair regarding witness protection I cannot go into much detail but Chair it has been difficult.  It has been extremely difficult.    Chair next – next month will be eight years.    It has been extremely difficult Chair especially the first few years.    My children basically grew up.    They have spent theirprime years in witness protection.  Our situation is very fluid Chair.  We live our lives on a month to month basis.  We cannot make plans further than a month.  So I am hoping Chair that me coming and testifying before this commission it will give some urgency to the processes that are outstanding be it the declassification of documents or other information that has not been forthcoming.    So I am hoping that something positive comes out of me testifying at this commission.    Chair lastly if I may?    During my time at Crime Intelligence I made decisions that – that I deeply regret Chair.    I am sorry for my actions.    And I humbly apologise Chair.    Here I also want to thank you for allowing me to come and share what I know.  Extend myappreciation to you and the commission Chair.    I thank you.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON     Colonel Naidoo when we adjourned yesterday we were dealing with page 47 of your witness statement and in particular we got to the point where you deal with the sale of SR vehicles and New World Motors, is there something you would like to say about that?      Yes.      Yes      Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo thenproceeding from page 49 you deal with, what you call a trade-in of General Mdluli’s private BMW, could you explain to the Chair what happened there?      Do you have a copy of that document?      So can you assume that you may have given this document to Mr Venter?      Yes you can explain this document Colonel Naidoo.      Yes and Colonel Naidoo can you explain then what happened in April 2011?      Can you explain that?      And Colonel Naidoo I’m not sure if the Chair can understand that explanation so can we just unbundle it slowly.    Colonel Naidoo can you explain then why at the end of these transactions there was an acknowledgement of debt between General Mdluli and not Leohaese but rather with Mr Jan Venterof Nissen Atlantis?    And Colonel Naidoo do you know what then happened to the two BMW’s that were purchased?    Yes Chair.  Chair the way that I understand it.  This transaction can only make sense in the following scenario and Colonel Naidoo you must tell me whether you understand it in the same way or not?    And so in order to settle that shortfall the    Is that correct?    Thank you.  Colonel Naidoo can we then dealwith the discounts given to Crime Intelligence members for the purchase of private vehicles by Nissan Atlantis from page 52 of your witness statement?    And then Colonel Naidoo could you deal with    And did you have any other dealings with thatvehicle?    And what happened?    No – yes.COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO   Who paid that?    Yes and Colonel Naidoo can you then deal with the – your private purchase of a VW Golf R32?    Is it another 40 000?  Ja.    Then Colonel Naidoo can you deal with the purchase of airline tickets?    Thank you Colonel Naidoo.  Will you now deal with the purchasing of the airline tickets?  And after you had spoken to Colonel Roelofse?    Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo you say on page 58 of your statement that you know the number of renovations that were carried out using the SSA account on the instruction of General Lazarus.  Could you deal with those?    And you said the claim was in your name?    And again was that claim put in, in your    Yes.    Yes.    Colonel Naidoo could you then deal with the renovations that were carried out to Minister Nathi Mthethwa’s property?    Yes.  It was.CHAIRPERSON   It deals with that annexure that was so badly …    Yes. CHAIRPERSON   And so did you fly …    So again Colonel Naidoo the claims were put      Colonel Naidoo under the heading miscellaneous do you have personal knowledge of what is stated in your statement under that heading?      And the further things stated?    Yes.     On page 60, paragraph 253 onwards.     The other events do you have personal knowledge of them stated the?      Now Colonel Naidoo after you were placed in witness protection did you testify at disciplinary proceedings broughtby the South African Police Services against General Lazarus in March 13?      And could you tell the Chair what occurred at those proceedings?      That is correct Chair.      What transpired at that disciplinary inquiry Colonel Naidoo?      Yes.      Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo did something ...[intervenes]       Yes.      Chair it was in doubt by him, we have subsequent to obtaining, to preparing the statement I believe that because Advocate Pretorius was involved in this disciplinary inquiry that now that document has become available to the Commission, and itcan be dealt with, with him, but it has not been dealt with with him.      He ...[intervenes]       Yes, it could have.      Yes ...[intervenes] CHAIRPERSON     Yes, Chair to clarify what was not dealt with was going through the entire transcript, but what was certainly dealt with with him were the findings that Mr Pretorius made about him and his credibility.      That was brought to his attention?      And it was brought to his attention in the context of the in camera application, and Chair you will remember that in that context Minister Cele’s counsel had said that this should not be heard in camera and that he is not a credible witness, Colonel Naidoo, and he was shown what Mr Pretorius had said, and that was...[intervenes]       He was shown the ruling that we had ...[intervenes]       No not to take home and read.      Chair because we dealt with it during the course of the consultation and we ...[intervenes]       Yes Chair, I understand that and I appreciate that, and I was not going to deal at this stage with that in any more detail than to give him an opportunity, which we have discussed, and which he very much wants to deal with, that finding that was made against him and he has comments that he would like to make on that.      Yes Chair.  Chair I understand that difficulty,I did contemplate that after Colonel Naidoo’s evidence there would be a number of applications to cross-examine Colonel Naidoo,   We have already had communication at the Commission with a number of people stating that they would like to cross-examine him and I viewed that this is an issue that would have been dealt with properly during that cross-examination, if it were to be granted.  What I wanted to put to Colonel Naidoo at this point is that he is aware that because he admitted to wrongdoing, in the Commission himself, Mr Pretorius found that this was a man who on his own version      Yes Chair.      Chair the – if I might try and explain to you what happened is I met with Colonel Naidoo, and we spent a long time together and we went through this whole aspect, we went through the whole ruling together.  I did not give it to him and say go away with it and read ...[intervenes]       I understand that we went through thatwhole process but can I just deal with it?    Chair perhaps what we could do is, if we could adjourn now and I can give Colonel Naidoo the whole ruling, he can have an opportunity to go through it…[intervenes].      Yes I appreciate that.      Yes.      Yes Chair.      Yes Chair.      Yes Chair.      Chair I don’t intend to ask question directly about the ruling.  Colonel Naidoo I want to deal with you with what it’s been like for you to be in witness protection but before we do that, I think that there is an issue that the Chair would like to understand and indeed the public would very much like to understand and that is, why when – after you had first been questioned by Colonel Roelofse on the18 t h, I think it was, of October…[intervenes].      Why did you say that on the 19 t h, despite your own involvement in this wrongdoing did you decide to tell him      Colonel Naidoo is it correct though when you made your statement on the 25 t h of October, you did say you wanted to be treated as a Section 204 witness?      So Colonel Naidoo if I understand you correctly what you are emphasising is that when you essentially came clean on the 19 t h of October at that stage there was no decision offered to you or taken in terms of which you would receive immunity from prosecution yourself?     Thank you, Colonel Naidoo could you please tell the Chair what it has been like for you to be in witness protection?    Thank you Chair I… CHAIRPERSON   I have no further questions.    No.
