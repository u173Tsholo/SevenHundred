CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Hulley, good morning everybody.    Yes.    Okay let me hear from counsel from Brigadier Ncube.  They will just sanitise first.      Yes, yes.    Yes.  No thank you.  Thank you.  And – okay there was counsel for Mr McBride as well is it not?  You confirm that you are fine with the arrangements?  Okay thank you.   I would have preferred that we continue.  I was going to hear argument about it being convenient that we postpone the matter to Thursday and I might have been persuaded that that is what we should do. But the fact that there have been logistical and administrative challenges relating to the bundles from the commission’s side counts strongly in favour of a postponement. I have been kept up to date about the challenge.  I know that it is not the fault of the legal team but it is unfortunate but it is going to be addressed.  It is a pity that we find ourselves in this situation. I know that counsel for – regarding – they indicated that although their preference was going to be that the matter be postponed to next week if I decided that we should proceed they – they would do their best to proceed. So – but I think that the issue of the challenges from within the commission outweigh everything in regard to the bundles.  So I will postpone the hearing of the evidence of Brigadier Ncube and the cross-examination of Mr McBride that was going to take place today.  It will now take place next Thursday when another implicated person was going to – to give evidence and I think cross-examine as well – General Mabula?    Yes.  So we will postpone the hearing of Mr Ncube’s evidence and the cross-examination of Mr McBride to next Thursday at ten o’clock.    Thank you.  I am going to adjourn but the commission will resume its sitting at twelve o’clock to hear certain evidence from witnesses whose identity at this stage is not to be disclosed.  So the commission will resume at twelve – twelve o’clock.  We adjourn.    I made some amendments to the draft order but I will read the whole order into the record and later on ...[indistinct] or that can be arranged.   1. It is recorded that this application was heard without prior notice to affective parties and failure to give notice is hereby condoned.  That is 1. 1.1. It is recorded that leave was previously granted for the hearing of the application in private whereafter the application on behalf of the person referred to in these proceedings as Witness 3 was postponed pending the delivery of a supplementary affidavit and judgment in respect of the application on behalf of Witness 1 and Witness 2 was reserved. 1.2. It is recorded that the supplementary affidavit in respect of Witness 3 has now been delivered.   2. Having previously heard argument on behalf of the applicant and considered the papers, the following order is made. 2.1. Condonation is hereby granted that there has been no compliance with Rule 3 of the Rules of the Commission with regard to furnishing statements or affidavits to any person implicated by the evidence of the witnesses to be referred to as Witness 1, Witness 2 and Witness 3. (The three witnesses in Annexure A to the application.) 2.2. The Commission’s legal team must, as soon as possible, after the evidence of the three witnesses has been heard, take necessary steps to ensure that the acting Secretary of the Commission, when she has all implicated persons with the appropriately redacted affidavits and the transcript of the evidence that will be heard from these three witnesses. In case you are looking at the draft order Mr Pretorius.  My 3 would be the previous 2.1. 3. The three witnesses are permitted to give evidence to the Commission in accordance with the following directives. 3.1. The three witnesses will not present in the hearing room at any time. 3.2. For the purpose of the three witnesses, a separate location (the protected witness location) will be provided. 3.3. The three witnesses will each give their evidence from the protected witness location. 3.4. No camera will be permitted in the protected witness location. 3.5. An audio link from the protected witness location will be provided so that the evidence can be heard in the hearing room when the evidence is given. 3.6. No persons, other than the Chairperson (if and when he considers it appropriate), the relevant evidence leaders, those necessary to assist or protect each of the three witnesses when they give evidence or any other person permitted specifically by the Chairperson will be permitted to enter the protected witness location.   3.7. The Commission’s Safety and Security Advisor who is the Head of Security for the Commission, or in absence another person specifically designated by the Chairperson, will have the responsibility of controlling access to the protected witness location in terms of this order and of ensuring that only the three witnesses and other persons permitted in terms of paragraph 3.6 above enter it. 3.8. Subject to the usual rules applicable to the    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Ja, no.  As I said also.  I think the 10 may be a repeat of an earlier one.    ...to the extent that it is... the numbering might have to change.    Ja.  Yes.  Yes, okay.  Thank you.      Yes.    Just to repeat what I said earlier on.  All the three witnesses have taken the oath.  So there will be no oath administered now.    I wonder whether we should test whether we can hear clearly what he is saying.  I am not sure that I can hear quite clearly.   I hear the voice but the actual words... I do not know whether you want to just ask him something and we listen so that if there is something that can be done to improve that, it can be done.    Oh, that was better.    Ja, okay.    Shall we first Mr Pretorius what bundle this will be called?    Okay I think let us call the bundle, Bundle Transnet 1 and then, of course, the statements will be exhibit... each one will have its own exhibit number.    Ja, okay.    The affidavit of the witness, Witness 1, appear in the bundle of Transnet 1 at page 1, is admitted and is to be marked as Exhibit BB14?    Hang on Witness 1.    H’m.    Do you want Witness 1 to say something so that you hear whether it is fine now or...?    Witness 1, just say something so that we can hear whether you are clearly audible.    Ja.    Yes, I think when he started the sentence, it seemed fine and then later one it was not fine.    The transcribers are making signs.  I do not know whether they want him to say something?    Just say something Witness 1 again.  Just say one sentence.  Any sentence.    H’m.    Just say, “I am giving evidence today”.    Yes, but ...[intervenes]     H’m.  But I want him to just repeat because the first few words are clear but then towards the end of the sentence it seems to...    Just say again Witness 1   That...I think that was better.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    H’m.    Do you want me to adjourn?    Yes.  I will take a five minute adjournment.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     We will take the lunch adjournment just to allow whatever needs to be done to be done.  We could come back at quarter to but maybe we should just make it two.  Mr Pretorius?    Quarter to two is fine?    And I guess we could go beyond four o’clock as well.    Ja.  Okay.  We will resume at quarter to two.  We adjourn.    Have the problems been sorted out?    Then we can – we can proceed.    What does Saxon refer to?  Is it a place different from Saxonwold or?    Oh.   Hang on, hand on one second Mr Pretorius.  I do not think for the record we have indicated that when it comes to page numbers you will be referring to the black numbers on the top left corner.    Ja.    Yes.  It is just that in the meantime when you were saying page 9 I was looking all over because I did not see the black numbers.    Ja, no, no that is fine.  It is just that for the reader of the transcript later.    It is important to always say it at the beginning of the day or ja.    Yes well we will go to a logbook as an example in due course.  When you say we visited, who visited?    Right.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius I may have missed this if you dealt with it.  Witness number 1 when in this table you indicate that – you indicate Saxonwold.  Do you know the owners of the residence or house that you are referring to?  And if you do?    Ja.  Whose house was that?    Yes.  So whenever in this table you refer to Saxonwold are you referring to that house?    And where you say Saxon number 26 is that another house of theirs or is that another house in Saxonwold that does not refer to them?    Okay alright.    So is it Sahara at Midrand or in Midrand?  Midrand is just to describe the place where they are allocated, is that right?    Yes.  It is not part of the name of the premises?    Yes so what I mean is although you wrote here Midrand Sahara Midrand was not part of the name of the offices, is that right?    Yes.  Okay.    The bag that you delivered that day, was it the same as the bag that we have seen at page 55 or was it different?    It was not the same?    Oh.  How was that one?  Are you able to describe it?  Or is there a picture of it?    Was the bag that he gave you to deliver to Mr Ajay Gupta similar to the one at page 58?    Okay.    Just repeat that.    Even the sides were similar.    Oh, okay.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Witness 1, a lot of people have said that they could not tell the one brother from another among the Gupta brothers, especially Mr Ajay Gupta and, I think, Mr Atul Gupta.  Are you certain that the picture at page 62 is a picture of Mr Ajay Gupta and not Atul Gupta?    Okay alright.    I am sorry.  Mr Siyabonga who?    Okay.    Sorry, did you say paragraph 32 or 42?      Mr Pretorius?    32.  Okay alright.    Okay.    Continue Witness 1.    This was at the Carlton Centre or where was it?    Okay.  Continue.      You mention in paragraph 32 about how much money you saw there in relation to the size of the bag.  Do you want to tell me exactly how much?  Not in terms of what the amount was but how much money was in the bag that you saw?  You do say in paragraph 2.     No, no, no, I am not saying say the amount.     Was it like a quarter in the bag, was it full, was it half in the bag?  Are you able to …[intervenes]     H’m?     And the bag we are talking about is the leather backpack similar one that we saw earlier on, is that right?     And when you saw this money on the day was that still close to the day when Mr Molefe had instructed you to deliver a bag to Mr Ajay Gupta or this was a completely different day, on another day, if some other time?     Oh, okay.     Ja, okay.     Not 26, ja.  Page 55, witness 1, is that the type of bag that had the money that you saw on that day?     Okay.     Did you say you approached him?     Oh, okay.     Sorry, he was?     I am sorry Witness 1, you approached Mr Molefe because you were concerned about the amount of cash that you had seen in the bag, is that right?     Because you thought it posed a threat to the safety of both of you.     And what did you say to him when you approached him?     I am sorry.  The note you made does not say you were followed by a car but you made a note that – I do not know if there is VTH and then TE and then P.  Is that the note you are referring to?     That seems to me like a code, code language for something or an abbreviation.  Is it VTH and if it is, what does it represent?  Of course, if it represents – well, if you are able to say without…     Oh, that is white P.     Oh, okay.  And what does P represent?     Oh, did you make that – did you write that on the same day?     Okay.     When I look at the picture at page 75 it looks as if to me there was somebody or there were two people, I don’t know whether appearing through the roof of the car, protruding through the roof of the car, that’s not what happened is that right.     But they were seated in the car, they were not, you could not see them as if they used the sunroof to appear through the roof of the car?     Oh, okay, alright.     Thank you very much witness one for your evidence we appreciate that you have made yourself available to assist the Commission, even when there may have been threats to your safety and that of your family, we appreciate that you made yourself available, thank you very much.     Yes, you are excused for purposes of these proceedings, thank you very much.  Mr Pretorius?     Yes, you may call him.     I wonder whether we should take a five minutes break while that is done.     We will take a five minutes adjournment.     We adjourn.     Yes, let’s continue.     Yes.     The affidavit of witness 2 appearing at page 80 – from page 80 to page 93 in bundle Transnet 1 is admitted and will be Exhibit 14b.  Is that right?     Oh, Exhibit BB14b?     Thank you.      Did he occupy a different position at some stage while you were his close protector prior to being the group CEO?           Okay.      Okay I think let us clarify that the picture of a car that appears at page 95 witness 2 whose car was that taken a picture of there?       Ja, just tell me what he said in eSiZulu?     Okay.  It is similar to what has been translated there as shady stuff.  It might not be exactly the same, it might have a wider meaning but I think for present purposes we can accept that that translation is not far from it.     It was in the boot.    And the instruction was for you to take the suitcase from Mr Gama’s car and take it where?    Okay.    I am on page 103.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius and Witness 2.  Why did he give you R 50 000,00?  Did he say why he was giving you that money?    It was ...[intervenes]     Was it... it was not money that he was going to ask you to give back to him at any stage?    Did you... was your understanding that he was just giving you the money for you to use it as you so fit?    Was it your understanding that he was giving you the money so that it would be your money which you could use as you so fit?    He did not say anything in particular about the purpose of the R 50 000,00, did he?    And he never asked for it back?    Okay alright.  Yes, you may continue Mr Pretorius.    One second Mr Pretorius.  After you... after Mr Gama had given you that money, R 50 000,00.  Did you keep it as cash without putting it into your bank account or did you first put it into your bank account before you used it?    Okay alright.  So you used it as cash until it was finished?    Yes, okay.    I am sorry.  You intend saying nothing more or do you intend saying nothing less than hundred thousand?  You said nothing more.    Okay thank you.     Thank you, Mr Pretorius.  Thank you, witness 2, thank you for coming to give evidence even within the circumstances that you have described in terms of safety, yourself and your colleagues, we appreciate that you decided that you wanted to come to the Commission and assist the Commission and tell it what you know and what you observed during those years.  Thank you very much for coming to give evidence, we appreciate it.  Thank you very much and you are excused.     You are ready for the third witness, witness 3?     Ja, let us go ahead.     Yes, I think we …[intervenes]     Ja, I think we should finish, ja.     Ja, no that’s five minutes adjournment.     We adjourn.     Are we ready?       Yes.   The affidavit of witness number 3 appearing at page 115 of Bundle Transnet 1 will be admitted and marked as Exhibit BB14C.      I just want to clear up something, I thought Mr Pretorius asked whether you were seconded, and I thought you said yes but I thought you said you were not employed at the time of that meeting, is that correct?  If you were seconded you would have been employed somewhere and then you were asked to go and work elsewhere but if you were unemployed at the time you would not be seconded.  Were you employed at the time you received that call?     Okay, alright.     There may be some confusion, as I understand you witness 3, you are saying as at the end of June you were employed by Transnet but with effect from the beginning of July you went to DPE, is that correct, or did I misunderstand you?     Did you go to DPE on a secondment or did you end your employment with Transnet and started a new employment at DPE or are you not sure?     Okay, alright.     Oh, I’m sorry, or is the position that, during May you received training for purposes – in preparation for you taking up employment at Transnet in June?     And in May 2013, that is now the month before June, were you employed, were you not employed by Transnet?     And you did not undergo the training that, that table reflect you underwent in May 2013, is that right?     Oh, so where it says May it should be June 2013?     Okay, thank you.     What types of trips did he say you should not record in the log book, was it trips to particular destinations or only trips to a particular destination, one destination?       Which address is that, is that the Gupta residence?     That was the only – those are the only trips he said you must not record?     Okay.  Did he say that from the beginning before you could even record the first one or you did record some but you had to stop after he told you not to record them?    When he told you not to record those trips to the Gupta residence was it at a time when you had already recorded some but then you did not record others because of the instruction or did he tell you not to record them before you could even record the first one?    Okay, alright.    Let us go back to the money you saw in the bag.  Was it just loose cash or was it tied in any way?    Yes.  And about how much space did it take in the bag if you are able to say about half, about a quarter or was it full?    About a quarter of the bag?    Okay.    That is because you do not know how it came to the car not because you do not want to tell us?  You do not know how the bag that had money came into the car, is that right?    Yes.    Yes okay.    I am sorry.  Do you – are you able to say roughly about how many times you may have seen him pay cash at restaurants because obviously somebody may pay cash on a particular day.  Is it something that appeared to be common that whenever he was at a restaurant, he paid cash or you saw him once or twice pay cash at a restaurant?    And other times?    You said certain times so I thought maybe you know of other times when he did not pay cash, he did not use cash, is that right?    Yes.  And altogether do you have an idea about how many times you might have taken him to a restaurant or you do not know?    Yes and on other times you did not see how he paid?    Okay alright.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    I just note that Witness 1 also said, I think, Mr Brian Molefe used to stay inside the Gupta residence 20-minutes to 30-minutes if I am not mistaken.  And I see here, it is also 20-minutes to 30-minutes. I do not know if I am mistaken about the time that Witness 1 said Mr Molefe used to stay there.  Whether...I do not think he went before that. I think he also said, maybe 20-minutes to 30-minutes or something.    Ja.  Yes.  I think the 20-minutes seems to be common.    Yes, okay.    More than once, can be two times.  It can be five times.  It can be twenty times.  Are you able to give a much closer estimate?    Plus-minus six times?    Did you see him only once emerging from the Gupta residence with a bag?  Let us forget about what was in the bag.  Just imagine from the Gupta residence with a bag.  Was it only once that you saw him or was it more than once?    H’m?    What is the answer?    Okay.    Okay, let us take it step-by-step.  Just listen to my question.  How many times, if you are able to tell me, did you take Mr Singh to the Gupta residence?  Just taking him there.   Do not think about whether you saw a bag with or without money.  Just, how many time, do you think, you took him there if you are able to estimate?    More than ten occasions.  Alright.  Of those more than ten occasions, how many times do you see him come out of the Gupta residence with a bag?  And at this stage, forget about whether the bag had money or not, just with a bag.    More than ten occasions?    Does that mean that most of the time whenever you took him, he would emerged from the Gupta residence with a bag?    Okay alright.  Of those more than ten occasions when he emerged from the Gupta residence with a bag, on how many occasions did you see what was in the bag?    Witness 3?    It was only on one occasion that you saw that there was money in the bag.    Was there any other occasion when you saw what was in the bag, even though it was not money or may it have not been money?    You never saw anything else inside the bag, you only saw money and it was only once?    Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.    When you say, he would come out of Knox Vault with an empty bag, did you have an occasion to open the bag and look inside or you are only able to say that because of how the bag looked like when he came back with it?    Yes.    Yes.  So even if there may have been something, it would have been far less than what had been there before he went into Knox Vault?    H’m.  You would not be able to say for sure there was completely nothing inside but it looked very different from the bag that he had taken in?    Okay.  Mr Pretorius.     I think you will have to repeat that answer, witness 3, because there was …[intervenes]     Okay.     Witness 3, is that the position?     Did you hear me?     Okay, alright.  Thank you.     Witness 3.     Are you struggling to hear us, witness 3?     Are you struggling to hear us at the moment?     Okay.     Had you – were you present or were you not present when the bag would have been taken from the E220 to his private vehicle or is that something that happened when you were not there?     Okay, alright.     Okay, alright.     So the week before he was appointed Group CFO, he had visited the Gupta residence.     Well it is – well I see that here I am hearing about somebody who visited the Gupta residence the week before getting appointed as Group CFO.     The day before yesterday I heard evidence of Mr van Rooyen that he was at the Gupta residence during the day on which he was later informed by the former President that he was to be appointed as Minister of Finance.     Yes, continue.     I am sorry, Mr Pretorius can we just – can the witness just repeat that evidence, I missed something, what about – what was the occasion and what about 600million.   In this Commission I have heard a lot of 600million Rand figures.     Was he talking on the phone or was he just speaking alone?     Oh, okay.        Maybe you can spell it for the benefit of the transcribers.     Witness 3 do you want to spell the name of that restaurant for the benefit of the transcribers?       Thank you.    Fifteen occasions of exactly or approximately?     Yes, but what I am asking is whether when you say fifteen occasions is that because you are sure that you took him there on fifteen or occasions or you are not sure about fifteen and you mean approximately or about fifteen occasions.     Okay.     Witness 3 you remember you told me that you took Mr Singh to Knox Vault, I think you said about six times, is that correct.     Are you able to indicate roundabout when that would have been, would it have been during a particular year, was it 2015 or when was it or can you not remember?    You were with him only for six months or was it more?     About a year     Would that have been 2014, or 2015 or another year?     So those six times when you took him to Knox Vault some of those times would have been in 2014 and others would have been in 2015, is that right?     Okay, alright, thank you.  Thank you very much witness 3 for coming to assist the Commission and to share with the Commission what you know about what happened when you were performing these duties or some of the people that you have mentioned we appreciate it very much, we understand your concerns about your safety and the safety of your family, but we are very grateful that you were able to come and give evidence.  Thank you very much, the Commission will do what it can, all that it can to assist with regard to having your issues of safety addressed.  Thank you very much and you are excused now.     That was your last witness?     Do you feel some more energy? We are going to adjourn for the day, tomorrow I am supposed to hear the evidence of a former Chief Financial Officer in the Free State Provincial Government, Ms Bati Dlamini, so wewill start at normal time, ten o’clock, but for now we are going to adjourn. We adjourn. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Good morning DCJ – sorry good morning Chairperson.    Mr Chair this morning’s proceedings is in relation to the matter of Brigadier Ncube who was implicated as you may recall by Mr Robert McBride who was at – at IPID.   Mr McBride implicated Brigadier Ncube as part of what he referred to as the Mabula Team.  General Mabula is to testify next week on Thursday and quite coincidently it seems that Mr – General Mabula happens to be represented by the same firm of attorneys and the same counsel as Brigadier Ncube.   Late yesterday I had a discussion with my learned friend who appears on behalf of Brigadier Ncube and who appears also on behalf of General Mabula – Mr Joubert of the Johannesburg Bar. We discussed the convenience of postponing the matter until next week so that – because it all deals with mostly the same issues. As you might recall Mr Chair insofar as next week’s proceedings are concerned Brigadier Ncube – sorry Brigadier Mabula has been implicated not only by Mr McBride but also by General Booysen and the evidence in relation to Brigadier – sorry in relation to General Mabula will deal with that evidence as well in other words General Booysen’s evidence as well. What we – or insofar as todays’ proceedings are concerned we have agreed with the other side that it would make sense to postpone the matter until next week not only because of the convenience factor as far as the different witnesses are concerned and for the sake of continuity of the evidence but also because of certain logistical difficulties that have arisen on the part of the commission’s preparation of the bundles and so forth. Some of the bundles may as we speak right now not yet have been made available to the other side but it is appropriate that they should consider the bundles and certainly do so in consultation with their client. In those circumstances Mr Chairperson with your leave we would ask that the matter be postponed until it is the 21 August, I believe next Thursday.  Mr McBride is in attendance this morning and I have discussed the matter with him, I have discussed the matter with his attorney – or with his attorney and his counsel and it is convenient for everybody if we postpone the matter until next Thursday.    That is correct Chair.    Thank you Mr Chair.    Thank you Mr Chair. 
ADV JOUBERT:   We have no objection Chair.    With the arrangements and the proposals. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    All rise. INQUIRY RESUMES     All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     All rise.
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair.  We will prepare a typed draft.    And hand it up in due course.    I am told that there may be one or two numbers that needed adjustment.    But that would be in order.    Yes, Chair.    Yes, but it will be consistent with what you have just put on record.    Chair, may we then, in accordance with those directions, call Witness 1?    Good morning Witness 1.  Are you available?    Thank you.    Yes.  Just for the record then, Witness 1, you have identified yourself to the Chair and you confirm that you have taken the oath.    Okay.  Witness 1, you have before you an affidavit.  It is marked Exhibit BB14A.  Do you have that in front of you?    Will you go to page ...[intervenes]     Alright.  Witness 1, can you hear us clearly?    And if you would speak very slowly, please?  Because your voice has been distorted and for us to hear you, you would have to speak very slowly and clearly.  Is that in order?    Alright.  Please go to page 21 of Exhibit BB14A.    Yes, Chair.  The three statements are included in a bundle marked Exhibit BB14 which is part of the sequence of that particular category of evidence.  The bundle is now Transnet 1.    Yes, thank you Chair.    Witness 1, will you please go to page 21.  You will see a signature that has been redacted but do you recall attesting to this affidavit?    Right.  As far as you are concerned and subject to any corrections and redactions that we might make during the course of your evidence, are the contents of this affidavit true and correct?    Chair, may we then admit Exhibit BB14A?    Yes, Chair.    As Exhibit BB14.  Ja. AFFIDAVIT OF WITNESS 1 IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT BB14    Witness 1, you are employed in the Transnet Group in a senior security position.  Am I correct?    And you have been employed in one or other capacity in the Security Division of Transnet since when?    1989?  Is that correct?    You have done relevant training, which we need not detail, but as referred to in your affidavit in paragraphs 4 and 5.    Right.  If we go over the page to page 1005, you will see there that the duties of a Close Protection Officer or the duties entailed in Close Protection are set out.  Briefly, will you tell the Chair what these duties are?    They are going to reduce the distortion Chair.    If you will just pause for a moment Witness 1.  We are going to try and adjust the distortion so that you can be heard at all.    Witness 1, if you would speak very slowly, please?    I do not know if that is sufficient Chair.  We are in communication with the technicians.    Yes, it did not improve at all.    It is a little better.    What I have done Chair is try to communicate with the technicians in order to lower the amount of distortions involved.    H’m.    Yes, and again, Witness 1, as slow as you can manage.    Perhaps you could start again and tell the Chair what Close Protection involves?    No, Chair it is not sufficient.    If you would just pause there Witness 1?    We either going to have to remove the distortion or lower it to a degree that you can be heard because you are breaking up.    Chair ...[intervenes]     Let us take a five minute break.    Quarter to two is fine.    Yes Chair.    Please if we could.    Thank you.    Yes so far so good Chair.      Yes thank you Chair.  Witness number 1 can you hear me?    Good thank you. If you would speak slowly please.  You were dealing with the meaning of close protection and what close protection involved.  Would you tell the Chair please?    And what do the duties involve?    The other duties very briefly?    Right.  How many close protection officers are employed in the various divisions of Transnet?    Yes and as a senior protection person within Transnet you performed several duties, they are listed in paragraph 8 of your affidavit.  We need not deal with them now but if you would just tell us please in terms of the Transnet Group Executive Protection Policy who is entitled to close protection services?    Thank you.  Did you perform close protection duties and act as a driver for any Transnet executive officer?    So did you act as a close protection officer and as a driver or either one of them?    You mean both protection and driving?    And for what period?    And at that time where was the Transnet head office?    Would you briefly describe your duties then in protecting and driving for Mr Molefe?    Alright.  Would you receive any information from Mr Molefe’s office in regard to your duties for the following week or Mr Molefe’s diary for the following week?    Alright.    Alright.  During the period that you protected and drove for Mr Molefe were you at any stage assisted by a colleague?    So…    Your duties – thank you – your duties in regard to Mr Molefe came to an end I think you said towards the end of 2014?    Right during that period what vehicles were used to transport Mr Molefe?  You can read from the affidavit.    Yes go on please.    Yes go on if you could just read the list.    And the description of the motor vehicle and the registration number where did you get that information from?    Okay.    Yes.  Now the logbooks that you have just referred to what happens to them generally once they have been used?    Right and your own logbooks or the logbooks that you kept?    What happened to the logbooks that you kept?    Okay.  Right in paragraph 19 of your affidavit you refer to certain trips to an address in Johannesburg. Would you tell – or addresses in Johannesburg please tell the Chair about that.    With whom did he meet?    Right.  And where did he meet Ajay Gupta at all these places or at only one or other of these places?    Right.  Were these meetings recorded in Mr Molefe’s diary?    Why not, do you know?    Right.  In paragraph 20 you set out in a table a summary of logbook entries. Before we go to the logbook copies attached if we could just go through the table that appears on page 8 and 9 as well as on page 10.  What happened on the 18 July 2011?    Right and the time of arrival and time of departure where is that information recorded?    Alright.  We are not going to deal with every copy but I will ask you questions at the end of your evidence in regard to the table.  When you say Saxonwold what do you mean by that?    In Saxonwold?    Alright.  And on the 19 July 2011 what happened?    Where?    In Saxon?    Is that the correct description – Saxon?    Thank you.  So it is not a correct description of the suburb is it?  The correct description as I understand and you say you that later is Saxonwold.    Yes okay.  And are the times there times extracted from your logbook?    Alright on the – over the page please on the 29 July 2011 what happened?    When you say we visited in relation to all these visits who visited?    Mr Molefe okay and are the times then on page 9 Transnet 1 page 9 in the top of the column adjacent to the entry 29 July with the first entry 29 July are those also extracted from your logbook?    And the next entry 29 July 2011?    Yes.  For the record.    That is correct we will refer to the black numbers in the top left-hand corner.  The witness is aware of that though.    Okay Chair.  Yes apparently, I am aware of the fact that those must really be on the right-hand side but we did not have time to do it here.    Yes.    No, no point taken Chair.  The second witness number 1 the second 29 July entry what happened on that day?    Right and the times related to that visit are they also extracted from your logbook records?    Yes.  On the 3 August 2011 what happened?    Again, in Saxonwold?    And are the times there reflected in the logbook?    On the 24 August 2011?    And again, the times are reflected in the logbook?    On the 14 September 2011 what happened?    At the times reflected in the logbook and in the table, is that correct?    What happened on the 19 October 11?    Is that a different address from the other addresses?    And the times reflected there – where are they recorded?    Right.  As recorded in the logbook?    On the 9 November 2011    On the 9 November 2011 what happened?    Right.  And the relevant times in the table are they extracted from your logbook?    Right.  And on the 24 November 2011 what happened?    Alright is that Melrose Ark or Melrose Arch?    Sorry you did not come through there.  It is what place?    Melrose Arch.    And again, the times reflected there on the table are they extracted from your logbook?    On the 21 February 2012 what happened?    Right.  And the times reflected there in the table are those also extracted from your logbook?    Over the page 12 March 2012.    Where did you go and with whom?    Do you know those offices?    Right.  You describe them as Midrand Sahara, is that…    Right.      Then on the 28 May 2012 what happened?    Again, the Gupta residence?    You say so later but we will get there.  And the times there reflected are they an accurate extract from your logbook?    On the 5 September 2012 what happened?    Right.  Mr Molefe?    Right and then on the – at the times reflected in the table do they coincide with the times in your logbook?    And finally, on the 12 September 12 what happened?    At the times there reflected?    Right you do make a note in your affidavit where you say Saxonwold, Saxon, Saxonwold one word, Saxon number 26 and Saxon number 1 are references to the Gupta residence at Saxonwold Johannesburg.  Saxon number 1 what address is that?    Alright. And you say there Michael Angelo and Sandton Michael Angelo are references to the Michael Angelo Hotel in Sandton Johannesburg?    You also say Melrose Arch Hotel refers to the Protea Hotel Fire and Ice Hotel in Melrose Arch Johannesburg?    And Midrand Sahara you say refers to the offices of Sahara Computers Pty Limited in Midrand Johannesburg, correct?    After September 2012 did you have any other occasion to transport Mr Molefe to the Gupta Saxonwold residence?    Alright.  This table that appears on pages 8 to 10 have you checked the information on this table with the records in your logbook which are annexed to the – to your affidavit?    So by – just by way of example – and before we go there to one by way of example is the information in this table reflected accurately as extracts from your logbook?    The documents at W1 number 1 to W1 number 15 what are those documents?  If you could just have a look at them, check them please?    And are those the logbook extracts or pages referred to in the table?    For example if we go to page 26 which is W1 02 – annexure W1 02 that is the last entry on page 8.      You are on page 26?    Which is the entry that is relevant for your evidence?    Right.  And the times, they are not very clear.  Are those in the right-hand columns?    So you would leave the previous    And then you would leave at 18   Alright.  So you say you have checked all the entries on this table with the entries in your log... they coincide.  And it is an accurate record in the table as reflected in the logbook?    If we move to paragraph 23 of your affidavit.  Did Mr Molefe tell you anything about the trips to the Gupta residence?    Yes.    Did Mr Molefe tell you why you were going to the Gupta’s residence or why he was going to the Gupta’s residence?    Did he mention any names?    Is that Ajay?    [laughs]  Sorry, the connection is not very good.  When you say AJ, can you spell it please?    Thank you.  How long did these visits last, the visits to Saxon World?    Alright.  And then, in relation to the offices of Sahara Computers, did you come to learn who Mr Molefe was visiting?    Who was he visiting?    Alright.  And what would happen at the hotels to which you transported Mr Molefe?    Alright.  So he would visit at the restaurants, would he?    You detail some occasions later in    Alright.  Would you look at page 55, please?  Annexure WU1(16)?    Where did you get this picture from?  It is a picture of what appears to be a backpack but it is not in colour.    You downloaded it from the internet?    And ...[intervenes]     How does that relate to the backpack you have described in paragraph 26 of your statement?    So you say the picture is the same as the picture that... of the... the picture of the backpack on page 55 ...[intervenes]     ...shows the same backpack or a similar backpack to the backpack that Mr Molefe used to carry with him to the Gupta residence?    What colour was the backpack because on page 55, it is not in colour but it looks black.  Is that correct?    Light-brown.  Okay.    Were there occasions when Mr Molefe would go to the Gupta residence without his leather backpack?    What would happen on these occasions?    Alright.  And could you tell from the look of the bag whether it was filled with anything or whether it was empty?    Alright.  What happened on the 18t h of January 2012?    Did you do that?    Is... can you hear me Witness 1?    Did you do that?  Did you ...[intervenes]     Alright.      Can you go to page 58, please?    Yes, do you see the picture on page 58?    What is depicted there?  What do we see there on page 58?    Right.    Alright.      If you look at page 60, please.  Then we are looking at the black numbers.    Yes.  You see there is an extract from a logbook what appears to be an extract from a logbook?    Do you recognise this page?    What entry is relevant to the evidence you are giving now in relation to the 18t h of January 2012?    Yes.  The last entry on the page against the date 18t h of January 2012, says Midrand Sahara as the destination.    Is that correct?    And then it says, “reason for use” and the entry there appears to be to deliver a bag.  Do you see that?    And the other details, what are they?    Yes, just straight along that line.    Oh.  No, it is ...[intervenes]     Right.    Okay and then the last entry, 18t h of January 2012, Midrand Sahara to deliver a bag.  The number 31337, what is that?    Okay.  And then the time?    Alright.  So those times reflect the time of the trip in question.  Is that correct?    Alright.  Did you ever meet Mr Ajay Gupta at any other place or on any other occasion that you recall?    Alright.  You see him there, did you?    Who was he with?    Alright.  If you would go to page 62, please?    Alright.  During your visits to the Gupta residence, did you see any other members of the executive ...[intervenes]     On the occasions that you drove Mr Molefe to the Gupta residence, did you recognise any other government officials or members of the executive there?    Anyone else?    Anyone else?    Did you see anybody else there besides Mr Gigaba?    Mhlango?  Yes.  Alright.    If one goes on then in your statement to paragraph 32, you describe an incident that happened in or near the main boardroom at the Carlton Centre.  Is that the main Transnet boardroom?    Right.  What happened on that occasion that you described in paragraph 32 and following.    [No audible reply]     Yes, 32.    Did I say 42?    32.    What happened on that occasion Witness 1?    With R 200,00 notes?    Right.    Right.  The light-brown leather backpack that you refer to ...[intervenes]     ...is that the same backpack that you mentioned earlier as a light-brown leather backpack or a different one?    Alright.     Just to assist the Chair, if you were to take those 200 notes out of the bag and put them on a table without flattening the pile at all, how high would that pile be?  You can just tell me in centimetres, more or less.     20 centimetres.     30?       Okay.  And the backpack you are referring to, that is the same backpack that you referred to in paragraph 26, am I correct?     Alright, the one depicted on page 55.     Alright.  Did Mr Molefe return from the meeting at any stage on this day and did you speak to him?     Did he say anything to you?     Alright.  Did you ever have occasion to run errands on behalf of Mr Molefe to the banks?     And did these trips to the bank involve similar dates in the month?     Right.  And what did you deposit?  Cheques or cash?     Sorry, what did you deposit?     Cash.     And the amounts that you deposited, what did they amount to, what were they?     Alright, and who gave you the money?     Alright.  Now prior to your giving evidence, have you ever been threatened?     On page 13 you describe what is called the first threat.  Tell the Chair about that please?     Sorry, before you go there.  Go back to page 13 please?  Are you at page 13?     And under the heading    Just very briefly, what did you do at the time of the incident or what had you just done at the time of the incident?     Right you were interviewed by Fundudzi Forensic Services and what happened after that?     Did you approach Fundudzi Forensic Services to ask them whether they had told anyone that you had been interviewed by them?     And what were you told?     Did that particular matter end there?     Over the page on page 14 you refer and testified to what you say in the heading is the second threat.  What happened on that day that you have spoken about earlier, 9 June 2019?     That is this Commission, the State Capture Commission, is it?     Yes.  And what happened on Monday 9 June 2019/     It is an SMS, is it?     Right and did you keep that message or a printout of that message?     And what did the message read?     Now when you say Witness 1, as being part of the message service, I understand it was actually your name in the message, is that correct?     Alright.     Did you report that threat to the South African Police Service?     If you go to page 64 what is that that appears on that page?     Remember we are with the black numbers.     That is the message you have just referred to is it?     And then you talk again at paragraph 45 of the third threat.  Briefly, what happened there?     And are you able to read the threat?     If you look at page 66, what is that on page 66?     Right, did you again report that incident and threat to the South African Police Service?     Then in paragraph 50 you relate and incident where you were followed by what you describe as suspect vehicles or you relate incidents, rather.  The first incident being at paragraph 51.  It is not necessary to go to all the detail there but what did you see on the 24 June 2019 when you were travelling on the M1 South?     Just look at the heading, was it grey or white?  What is your recollection?  Look at the heading on page 16.     So white is incorrect, is it?     No, look, we are on page 16, black numbers.     Okay, no, no, no, you are quite right, let me not interfere with your evidence.  You tell the Chair what you have in paragraph 50.     Alright and I do not think it is necessary to go into the detail but from the nature of the incidence incurred what did you conclude?  What did you think was happening?     Right, did you – will you go to paragraph 59, that is the second instance of being followed.  Did you keep any notes or make any notes of that incident?     And if we go to page  - just bear with me for a moment, to page 69, is there anything on this – what is this page, at page 69?       Where is that entry?     Where is that entry on page 69?     Is that in the bottom left hand corner?  You have got White P there.     And the next …[intervenes]     And then the third instance of being followed, is that paragraph 60 and following?   Is that another occasion on which you concluded that you had been followed as you described in your statement?     Alright, let’s go to W124, that’s on page 73, it’s not very clear but what is this picture that we see on page 23?     Yes and on page 75, what is that?      Yes, but it seems, and did you take these – how did you take these pictures?       Right, at paragraph 65 and following you relate precautions taken for your own safety, these incidents that you have referred to did you report them?     Paragraph 65 and following.     Well let me just put the question to you like this, since these incidents occurred have you taken any precautions in regard to your safety?     And do you relate these and your security concerns on pages 18, 19 and 20.     Those have been fully canvassed in the application for you to give evidence in the manner you have today.     Is there anything else you wish to add, that I may have missed?     Thank you Chair that is the evidence.     Thank you witness one.  Chair may we call then witness number two.     We will take a minute or so to clear the hearing venue and to bring witness number two in to the room.     Sure, thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair, may we call witness number 2?     Yes, witness number 2 can you hear me?    Right, you have in front of you a pile of documents marked Exhibit BB14b.  Is that correct?      Would you go to page 80 and I am referring to the numbers in the top left hand corner, the black numbers.      Do you recognise this document?     Is this an affidavit that you attested to?     If you go perhaps to page 92 you will see that there is a space for a signature which appears to have been redacted or blacked out.  Do you recall signing this affidavit?      Subject to any corrections we may have to make and subject to certain deletions or redactions are the contents of this affidavit as far as you are aware true and correct?     Right.  Chair may we then admit this affidavit and its annexures as Exhibit BB14b?     14b, BB14b.      Correct Chair, thank you.      Witness number 2 are you employed as a security officer in the Transnet Group?    There was a break in your employments and we may talk about that later.  But were you previous employed as a close protection officer and personal driver in the Transnet Group?     Who did you protect and drive for?    You broke up there slightly Siyabonga who?      Gama, thank you.  And what office did Mr Gama hold at the time?     And then did you later also act as his CPO and driver when he had left Transnet Freight Rail and joined Transnet?    And in what capacity was he employed at Transnet when you served him?     Do you have qualifications as a close protection officer and are you trained in that profession?     What were your duties in providing CPO services to Mr Gama?     Did you do this on a daily basis?     And did you…[intervenes]      I am sorry I interrupted you.      And would someone stand in for you on those days?     And did you ever transport Mr Gama on private trips?      Did you ever transport Mr Gama on private trips?

As you say in paragraph 9.2.      And then page 97?      Witness number 2 the picture shown on page 95 whose car is shown there?      Okay you broke up there the Range Rover Evoque, is that correct?     Is that the same as the Range Rover sport?      Alright because if you look at paragraph 9.4.2.      The vehicle described there is a Range Rover sport, must that be corrected?     Okay.  How do you spell that word is it evoke or vogue?     Alright.  In any event to whom did that car belong?

Alright we do not have to give the life history of each vehicle let us just name the vehicles if you would please.      Right did you keep a log book of daily trips undertaken by Mr Gama?      Why not?     In paragraph 10 you talk of occasions where you transported Mr Gama.  Tell the Chair of these occasions please.  How many occasions and where did you transport Mr Gama?     How many occasions did you transport Mr Gama there as you recall?     Okay so three or four trips?     Okay and were these trips recorded in a diary?

Did he arrive on his own or was he driven there by anybody?      What car was he driving can you recall?     Right and do you know what position Mr Gama held at that time?     Of Transnet do you say?     Oh I see my apologies.  Mr Molefe what position did he occupy at the time?     Alright.  In paragraph 15 and following you relate an incident that occurred as you say during about November 2016 on an occasion related to a visit to the Gupta residence.  Would you tell the Chair about that please?     Before you go on sorry - witness number 2 - before you go on where had Mr Gama come from when he told you this?    Right continue please?    Are you able to describe from memory that suitcase?    Right please look at page 99.      And what is that that you see in the picture?    Right.  And how does it relate?    Right.  Did Mr Gama return from the residence at any stage?    Well before we get there.  You say that Mr Gama came out of the residence, told you that you should expect a person who would be bringing a bag to you, that happened but after Mr Gama came out did, he go back into the residence or did he go any other place?    Right.    The gentleman walked out of the – out of what place?    Right.      Right and had Mr Gama returned to the residence at that stage?    Did Mr Gama ultimately come out of the residence?    And what happened then?    And what did you do then and what did Mr Gama do?    I am sorry to interrupt you witness number 2.  Let us just get the sequence right.

The address to which you drove?    The exact address?  Oh, I see yes at the bottom of the page.    Right.  Let us just go back to paragraph 25.  I understand your records confirm that you went from Melrose Arch to an address – was it Sandton or Bryanston?    At the bottom of the page.    Yes okay good.  Let us go to the next paragraph, paragraph 25.  At this address in Bryanston, Sandton what happened?    Alright.  Did you ...[intervenes]     I am sorry.  Before you go on Witness 2.  Did you see inside the bag?    Do you remember the denomination or did you notice the denomination?    And again, was the bag half-full, complete full?    A quarter full?  Right.    And what did you observe or what did you do when the bag had been opened?    During this ...[intervenes]     I am sorry, Witness 2.  During this process, were you able to estimate how much money was in the bag?    Alright.  And how did you calculate or conclude that it was a million rand approximately?    Thank you.    Alright.  What did he do with the money that was left over after giving you the R 50 000,00?    You say, Witness 2, that he divided the money and he gave you R 50 000,00.  What happened to the one million rand, approximately, that had been divided?    What did you do with the money that was given to you?    Right.  What were you building?    Alright.  At the bottom of page 86 ...[intervenes]     Good.  Witness 2, on page 86, at the bottom of the page, paragraph 27, you relate another incident that you say occurred on the 13t h of July 2017.  What happened on that occasion?    Alright.  What did this package look like?    Right.  Different or similar to the one that you described earlier.      Not as big?    Right.  So you went to... with Mr Gama to Melrose Arch, did you?    And did you meet anyone together with Mr Gama in Melrose Arch?    Alright?    Right?    And did that happen?    Was Mr Essa alone or he was accompanied by anyone?    Right.  I am just a little confused as to the sequence of events.  You say that Mr Gama went into the hotel?    And when mister ...[intervenes]     And did Mr Essa come to meet you?    Alright.  Because I must point out to you ...[intervenes]     In paragraph 27, you say   Have a look at paragraph 27.    Right.  And on the particular occasion that we are talking about on the 13 t h of July, what happened after Mr Gama and Mr Essa came out of the residence or the apartment? WITNESS    Where did you ...[intervenes]     Right.  The plastic bag, you say, was put in the boot of the vehicle.  What did you do then?    That was the residence in Sandhurst, you say?    Yes.  Okay and who went into the residence at that address?    Who went inside?    And where were you?    And did you do anything whilst you were waiting at the vehicle?    Alright.  What did you see in the plastic bag?    Right.  Were you able to estimate approximately how much was contained in that plastic bag?    Alright.  Okay let us go to paragraph 29, where you refer to certain records which appeared to be a printout of Google Maps.  WU207 on page 108.  What is depicted here?    The date at the top of the page is 13 July 2017 and there are certain records which appear beneath that.  Where does this picture come from?    Right.  Your cell phone, is that right?    Oaky and what does it tell us?  Just briefly.    Alright.  It shows Melrose Arch and then in the shaded part an address.    And is that address close to the residence you visited or Mr Gama visited?    Okay.    Were you ever accused of any acts in relations to money that ...[intervenes]     What was the accusation?    Right.  You refer at the bottom of page 87 to two other occasions where you say you discovered cash.  What were those events?  Will you please tell the Chair?    Alright.  Just before you go on, you say in the back boot.      Was it just laying in the boot?  Has it... had it been concealed?  What did you see?    Right.  And what vehicle was this?    And just tell the Chair again.  What did you find in the spare wheel compartment?    Can you estimate from memory how much was contained in that spare wheel compartment on that occasion?    Alright.  Was there any other occasion?    You relate another incident in paragraph 36 that apparently occurred on the t h of April 2017.  What happened on that occasion.    Can you estimate once more, please?  Approximately how much you saw on that occasion?     You relate some further incidents on page 88 in paragraph 40 and following.  What happened on that occasion?  You say sometime during June 2016.  But before we go there perhaps for completeness sake would you look at W209?     At page 112.  There appears what appears to be a similar printout of Google Maps or a map application, am I correct?  Page 112?     Under the date 20 April 2017.     What does that printout tell us?     Right, that you were in Centurion at a stage?     Alright.  Let us go on to the incident referred to in paragraph 40 and following.  What happened on that occasion?     Right.  From what you saw – and I stress from what you saw, could you tell what was contained in the box?  And I stress from what you saw.     Did you see what it did contain?     Alright.  I think we should be clear here, witness 2, you did not see what was in the box.     You concluded from what you heard at the time and from what the box felt like, particularly its weight, that it might contain paper or paper notes.  Do I understand you correctly?     What was the conversation that drew you to that conclusion?     Let us go on then to the incident described in paragraph 42 and following.  What happened during the course of that incident?     What happened?     Colleague of whom?     You say you met up with a former colleague.     And colleague of who?  Whose colleague?     Right.     Did you travel to the N17 highway with the colleague or associate of Mr Gama?     Right.  And what happened, did you go to the N17 highway?     Right.  And what happened on the highway?     Again, did you have an occasion to observe what was in this package?     Because you say in your statement – well, let me not lead you on this.  Did you observe anything or did you make any conclusions?  If you drew any conclusions please tell the Chair what conclusions and why you drew them?     So from the circumstances and your experience that was your conclusion but did you see anything in that packet or package?     Right.  Was there anything else that led you to that conclusion that occurred at the time?     On page 90, witness 2, you deal with the current breakdown in the relationship between yourself and Mr Gama.  Would you tell the Chair please briefly what happened in this regard?     Witchcraft in what sense?  What was the content of the accusation?     Right.  Is it correct that you sprinkled a substance in and around the residence of Mr Gama?     What happened after you had been accused of this action?     You say you took steps to resign from Transnet?     When was that?     Right.  And you say that you were then learnt of disciplinary proceedings that had been conducted.  Obviously, they were conducted in your absence, am I correct?     And what was the outcome of those disciplinary proceedings?     Did you subsequently approach Transnet about this “dismissal”?     What was the outcome of your approach to Transnet?     Right, so it must have been considered that you had been unfairly dismissed and you were reinstated, am I correct?     You go on in your affidavit at page 91 and 92 to set out your concerns about your personal security.  Did you believe that your personal security was under threat?     Right, were these threats directed directly to you or to someone else?     Alright, I am just looking at your affidavit, witness 2, at page 91 and 92.  You do not mention any threat there being made to you directly.  Is there any reason for that?     Right.  Thank you, is there anything else you wish to tell the Chair that I have not covered?     Thank you, witness 2.  I do not have any further questions.     Yes, Chair.     May I assume that we are going to finish witness 3?     I would ask that we do.     Thank you, if we might just take two minutes to make the arrangements for one witness to be moved out and the other to be moved in.        Thank you Chair.     Yes Chair, thank you.  May we call witness number 3?     Witness number 3 can you hear me?   Hello witness number 3, can you hear me?     Good, you have a bundle of documents before you, marked Exhibit BB14C, am I correct?     Would you go to page 115, I’m referring to the black numbers in the top left-hand corner of the document.     Do you recognise that document?     Is it an affidavit?    Is it your affidavit?      Please go to page 132, there’s a space for a signature at the bottom of that page which has been redacted, do you recall signing this affidavit?  Witness number 3?     You recall signing this affidavit?     As far as you are aware, and subject to any corrections we might have to make and subject to any further redactions that we might have to make, are the contents of this affidavit true and correct?     Right, Chair, may this Exhibit be entered onto the record?     Thank you Chair.  Witness number 3 are you employed in a senior security position in the Transnet Group?     Right, on page 116 and 117 there’s a table which shows your previous employment, I don’t want to go into any detail there for reasons which we have made clear to the Chair but if we can go to paragraph 4, did you have some experience as an employee of South African Police Service?     And, were you, in fact, during 2004 a member of the VIP Protection Unit of the South African Police Service?     And you describe, in paragraph 6 the duties of a Close Protection Officer, were you trained as a Close Protection Officer?     Briefly what are the duties of a Close Protection Officer?     Yes, during 2005 were you assigned as a Close Protection Officer to any particular Minister or Deputy Minister?     To whom were you assigned?     Right, during the period – well first, during which period were you assigned as a Close Protection Officer to Deputy Minister Gigaba?     Okay, and did you ever have occasion to accompany Deputy Minister Gigaba to any entity related to the Gupta family?     Right, when did you resign from the South African Police Services and as Close Protection Officer for Deputy Minister Gigaba?     Right, how did you come to be involved with Deputy Minister Gigaba, could you just relate it please, you deal with that at paragraph 10 of your statement and following, you deal with your appointment at Transnet and your secondment to the Department of Public Enterprises?     Right, did you attend the meeting?     And what did you learn at that meeting?     Right, so you were required – it wasn’t very clear, do I understand you correctly, you say, you would be required to provide close protection and vehicle backup duties?     What does vehicle backup mean?     Okay, at that time, who were you employed by?     I’m sorry that didn’t come through, just speak slowly please, you were employed by whom?     But, as I understand it, you were seconded after that meeting that you’ve just told the Chair about, to the Department of Public Enterprises, am I correct?    And your duties were to perform close protection duties for Deputy Minister Gigaba and vehicle backup support, am I correct?      Alright, so let’s just summarise to get it clear, perhaps the dates are not clear.  When Mr Gigaba was the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and you were assigned to act as his Close Protection Officer, I understand that to be during 2005, is that correct?     And it was after that and before our resignation from SAPS in 2008 that you, together with Deputy Minister Gigaba visited Sahara Computers in Midrand on a number of occasions, is that correct?     And then, you say in April 2013 you received a call from an official in the Department of Public Enterprises and you had the meeting with Mr Gigaba, who was then Minister for Public Enterprises, am I correct?     Alright and you took up that position as a backup driver as well as a Close Protection Officer, correct?     And after July 2013 in serving Minister Gigaba as he was at that time, you were employed by the Department of Public Enterprises, is that correct?     Sorry, you say you were in Transnet at that time?     Alright, so in July 2013 you were employed by Transnet or at that time you were employed by Transnet, is that correct?     And then from the 1 s t of July you were employed by the Department of Public Enterprises in order to serve Minister Gigaba?     Yes, well it’s clearly put in the table that we didn’t deal with, because it details your employment in a way that, perhaps, could identify you but let’s look at page 116, witness number 3 there you see part of the table of your employment history.  Could you go to item 3 on page 116 please, are you there witness number 3?     It says there,  “Transnet, May 13, security training course during first month, Does that indicate that you were employed by Transnet in May 2013 and underwent a security training course?         Oh, so should May read June then?    Okay…[intervenes].      And how long, witness number 3, did your secondment to the Department of Public Enterprise last, when did it come to an end?     So, during the period, July to December 2013 you were serving Minister Gigaba, is that correct?     In paragraph 21 of your affidavit, witness number 3, you relate certain visits that took place, would you tell the Chair about those please?     On, approximately how many occasions did you do that?     Right and on those occasions did you drive a backup vehicle or did you drive with Minister Gigaba?     Were any of these visits recorded in the Minister ’s diary?     Alright…[intervenes].    Did you have access to the Minister ’s diary as a Close Protection Officer?      Yes, and paragraph 21.1 you say, and I don’t understand your evidence, now, to be this, that none of these visits were recorded in the Ministers diary.  So, what was the position?     So, were they, or were they not recorded in the Minister ’s diary?     And did you record these trips in the log book of your vehicle?     Did he give a reason for telling you not to record them in his log book in your vehicle log book?     Right.    When you were part of the convey which visited the Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s what did you do?  Did you – when Minister Gigaba visited where were you during those visits?    Right were you able to observe whether there were any other people present outside the residence?    Alright.  Did you see any other convoy at that time or around that time?    Who was he President at the time?    Alright.  In paragraph 2 you talk of certain incidents involving Minister Gigaba.  Would you tell the Chair about those incidents please?    Who is us?    Right.    Right.    Are you able to say where that money came from?    How can you say that?    What type of bag was it?    On that particular occasion where had you been on that day?  Can you recall?  Witness 3 did you hear my question?    Alright.  You have just told the Chair of an occasion where you saw a bag in the boot of Mr Gigaba’s official vehicle and you say Minister Gigaba opened that bag and you could see stack of R200.00 notes in that bag right?      Correct?    Right now I asked you earlier because your statement says nothing in relation to where that bag came from.  Are you able to say where that money came from through any observation that you made not any opinion that you might have but through any observation from what you saw?  Did you see where that bag came from?    I am sorry.    Okay.    And nor does your statement say where it came from.  You have expressed an opinion earlier in your evidence but I just wanted to establish that according to your statement and what you say now you do not know the history of that bag and how that money came to be in the bag and the bag came to be in the boot of the Minister, we are correct?    Okay.  You say that you were present when Mr Gigaba went shopping in Sandton City for tailored suits.  Do you recall that incident or those incidents?    Did Mr Gigaba buy suits and pay for them?    He paid cash right?     Right.  And when he ate at restaurants where you were able to observe how did he pay for meals and drinks?    Right.  You move on in…    Thank you Chair.  Where were you employed during January 2014?    And in July 2014 were you given certain duties to perform?    The Chief Financial Officer Mr Anoj Singh?    Were you a driver as well?    Right.  And what was you practice in relation to Mr Singh were you his personal driver?  In other words how did you operate with him as his driver?    What vehicles did you drive for Mr Singh?  I am on page 123 of your affidavit paragraph 35.    Sorry you broke up there.  A white Mercedes?    Yes.    Okay white Mercedes C220 and a white Mercedes E350.    Can you remember the registration numbers?    And the 350 can you recall that registration number?    Did you say KFGP?    Right.  Did you keep logbooks of trips undertaken in these vehicles?    Right.  Have you subsequently attempted to obtain these logbooks in order to substantiate the trips undertaken for Mr Singh?    And what was the result of your efforts?    Did you ever drive Mr – or sorry not – did you ever drive him but did Mr Singh ever use a private vehicle?    Right and when would he use that vehicle as you recall?    Okay.  Right in paragraph 38 you relate some incidents in relation to your duties serving Mr Singh.  Tell the Chair about what you say in paragraph 38 and following please?    And upon arrival at the Gupta residence what would happen?    And how long did he remain in the premises?    I am sorry I interrupted you.    Alright.  And during that time, Mr Sing would be inside the Gupta Residence, I presume?    It was slightly different but in any event, the record will show.    Yes.    And do you have any recollection of incidents that happened after the meetings, when Mr Sing emerged from the residence?    H’m.    Did you ever have an occasion to see what was contained in a bag that Mr Singh brought out of the residence of the Gupta’s?    Alright.  What happened?  Please tell the Chair.    I am sorry.  We are at paragraph 41 of your statement.    Right.  How often did this happen?    Did it happen once, several times?    Alright.  I may have confused you with my question where you may not have been following my question Witness 3.  How many times did he emerge from the Gupta residence with a sports bag that looked as if there was material or something inside the bag?    Right.  How many times did you see money, actually observed money, in the bag?    How many?    You saw money six to seven times?    Well, look at paragraph 41 of your statement.  Please have a look at that.      Your evidence now does not seem to accord with what you say in paragraph 41 because in    ...that that happened six times.    So what is the position?  How many times did you see Mr Singh emerged from the residence with a bag?    I am sorry?    Alright.    Alright.  You say in... I think that is now clarified that.  Thank you, Witness 3.  You say that in    Alright.  What is Knox Vault.  K-n-o-x Vault?  What is it?  Do you know?    Right.  Alright.  So on your way you would take Mr Sing to Knox Vault after a visit to the Gupta residence?  Did you go there out of your own accord or did Mr Singh instruct you to go there?    Alright.  And what would happen when you arrived at Knox Vault?    Alright.  So you say he would instruct you to open the boot.    And the bag, was it empty or was it full?  Could you see?    Alright.  So you would go to the Gupta residence.  After visiting the residence, you would go to Knox Vault with Mr Sing.  He would take a full bag into Knox Vault and emerge from Knox Vault with an empty bag.  Do I understand that correctly?    Alright.    That is correct Chair.    The incident that you have just described, coming from the Gupta residence and taking a bag into Knox Vault after that visit to the Gupta residence, on more or less how many occasions did this occur?    You recall an incident in 2015 when you were driving Mr Singh to a scheduled meeting and something happened to interrupt your trip to that scheduled meeting.  Do you recall that incident?    What happened then? WITNESS    Did he come out eventually?    Right.    Alright.  Did you ever find out what led to his distress on that day?    Alright.  In paragraph 47 and following, you relate an incident that occurred at the Three Rivers Lodge.  When was this incident... when did this incident occur?    And what happened?    Right.    And it was an executive management meeting of which company?     Right and it was taking place at the Three Rivers Lodge you say in Vereeniging?     And you tell the Chair that you dropped Mr Singh off early in the week and you came to collect him on the Friday afternoon?     When you arrived at the Three Rivers Lodge on the afternoon of the Friday, what did you observe?     And what happened next?     And then continue, what happened after that?     Did you do that?     Right.  Was the bag light, heavy, full, empty?  What did you notice?     Right and are you able to say whether the bag – you had seen the bag earlier?     Witness 3, please speak slowly and say that again.     Right, did you then take the bag and what did you do with it?     Right and did you see anybody else at that time in relation to these events that you are telling us about?     Right, this black bag, had you seen it before?     Right.     Alright.  On that occasion, on that day, we are talking about a Friday.  Did you have occasion to see what was in the bag?  Now I am talking about the Friday now.     Can you hear me, witness 3?     Alright, you can hear us.  The question I am putting to you is, you are talking about an incident that happened at the Three Rivers Lodge in Vereeniging on a Friday in July 2014, am I correct?     On that Friday, not the next Monday but on that Friday did you see what was in the bag that you put into the boot of Mr Singh’s vehicle?     Right.  What happened the next Monday?     Right, now was this bag – you say it was the same bag?  The same bag as what?     Right, on the Friday at the Three Rivers Lodge, right?     Were you able to recall the weight of the bag on the Friday as compared to the weight of the bag on the Monday?     Right and you say you opened the bag to see what was inside the bag and what did you see inside the bag?     And how did you communicate with Mr Singh?     When you went to collect Mr Singh at Three Rivers Lodge on that Friday in July 2014 what vehicle were you driving?     Okay, so it was a Mercedes Benz.     So you saw the bag in a different vehicle on the Monday, do I understand you correctly?     Did you ever have occasion to go with Mr Singh to the business of Sahara Computers?     Can you recall on how many occasions you did that?     Alright.  And do you know who he visited at Sahara Computers?     Not sure that the next two paragraphs really are of any relevance to what we are saying but did you ever pick up an associate or a person who was a friend of Mr Singh at Sahara Computers?     And this person, who did she work for?     And previous to that?     You go on in paragraph 57 to talk of close protection officer services to a Mr Gary Pita.  Is that P-i-t-a?     When was that?     Alright, 2016 to 2018 you say you served Mr Gary Pita.  Was this in a capacity as driver and close protection officer?     Was Mr Gary Pita the newly appointed Chief Financial Officer of Transnet?     And what vehicles did you use to transport Mr Pita?     The same vehicles that Mr Singh used?     And the logbooks for those vehicles, for that period could you find them?     Yes but since then did you attempt to find them?     Yes, alright.  Did you ever have occasion to drive Mr Pita to the Gupta residence?     On how many occasions?     Right.  On the first occasions what occurred?      Did anything happen other than a visit to the Gupta residence?     How long did he spend inside the residence?     Alright.     Yes.    Right.     The second occasion was when witness number 3?     Right, did he go into the residence on that occasion?     When he came out what did you notice about him?     Alright.     We will have to collate that evidence with other evidence Chair.  Just tell the Chair again please Witness number three what happened on the second occasion when Mr Pita returned from – as he was coming out.        Right you mentioned earlier in your evidence in relation to Mr Singh transporting Mr Singh to Knox Vault, did that ever occur with Mr Pita?     Tell the Chair please what happened in relation to these visits?     That evidence will be collated with other evidence I regard to Knox Vault’s records Chair.  In paragraph 65 you deal with visits by Mr Pita to Mr Saliem Essa, do you know Mr Saliem Essa by site?       Right what restaurant was this, it is an unpronounceable name but let’s try.     Right.     Well he does much better than I do when I tried to pronounce Parreirinha.     Right is that a restaurant in Turffontein?     On how many occasions did you drive Mr Pita to meet Mr Essa at this restaurant?     Right, and were these meetings, short meetings?     After Mr Pita’s departure from  Transnet did you continue to perform duties as a close protection officer in Transnet?     Right.   You deal on page 129 with some aspects of your career after working for Mr Mohamedy but I don’t think it’s necessary for us to go there, you continued to work in a security function do I understand you correctly?     Alright if you go to page 130 you deal there with security matters, just briefly tell the Chair how did you and do you regard the circumstances of your personal security after you had become involved with the Commission?  Do you understand the question?     Your personal security in the time leading up to your giving evidence today how do you regard your personal security?   Your personal safety.     Right.  And you explain those circumstances fully you have explained them in a supplementary affidavit which has been part of the application but you also explain them to a degree at least on page 130 to 132.  Is there anything you would like to add to your statement that I haven’t mentioned?    Thank you very much Witness number 3.      Thank you witness number 3.     Correct.  I hoped there were more but ... 
COMMISSION TEAM MEMBER:  Please try and speak with Witness 1.    [No audible reply]     [No audible reply]     We are just trying to reconnect the call.  Chair, sorry.    There we go.  Witness 1, can you please say something?
