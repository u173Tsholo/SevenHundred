CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Are we ready?    Yes.    Yes they may do that either from where they are seated if they put on the – if – ja there is no they can go to the podium.  Somebody must just sanitise before they go there.    Yes thank you very much Mr Masuku.  Yes Mr Seleka.    Yes.  Good morning Mr Molefe.    Thank you.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Thank you; you may be seated.    Yes Mr Seleka.    Well you – I was expecting you to first indicate for the benefit for the public where Mr – what Mr Molefe will be testifying.    About – he will be questioned about and so that the public will follow.  Maybe you should do that and then once you are done with that Mr Masuku can address me.    Well one – the one matter which you – should be mentioned is that he will come back at some stage to deal with matters relating to Transnet.    So generally speaking today he will not be dealing with Transnet matters.    Ja.    Okay alright.    Ja.  Okay alright.  Then Masuku can address me if he wishes to address me.    So you are going to complain?    No thank you Mr Masuku.  I think to the extent that he may have received certain documents late and therefore has not had an adequate opportunity to prepare himself on certain documents or issues there will be no difficulty where he is not able to answer because he needs more time to look at those documents.   There will be no difficulty in arranging that he can deal with those at some other time or he might file an affidavit and then he might be asked questions when he comes back as I indicate he must still come back to deal with non-Eskom matters. So there will be no difficulty.  Every effort is made to make sure that there is fairness.  We might not always succeed but we will keep on trying to make sure. So there will no – no difficulty in regard to documents that he really has not had enough time to look at because the commission gave him those late. With regard to the question of criminal matters and the fact that he may in regard to some question wish to not to give an answer in order not to incriminate himself that if and when that is raised we will all deal with it then. Whether or not anything that may fall under the civil action but not under the privilege not to incriminate yourself whether or not that could be a ground not to answer we will deal with it if and when it arises.  It might not arise. So – so – but that is fine.  Let us see how it goes and – and where there are challenges or concerns we will deal with them.    Thank you.  I will allow Mr Molefe the opportunity to read or make some remarks or statements before he gives evidence.  As I understand from you Mr Masuku that he would like that opportunity.  Mr Molefe I have indicated to your counsel that although I have allowed other witnesses to – that opportunity from a certain time I have been concerned whether we should insist that we should receive a written statement in advance so that we could see whether it will implicate any third parties or any other people in wrongdoings so that the relevant procedural issues can be attended to. But my understanding from your counsel is that your statement should not have anything like that.  So after Mr – before Mr Seleka starts leading your evidence I will allow you the opportunity to either read the statement or make the remarks that you – that you wish to make.  Mr Seleka.    Are you ready to start or do you still have some housekeeping issues to attend to?    Oh okay.    Well I think let us – let us allow Mr Molefe to make his remarks or read his statement and then after that we – we – you can then take it from there.    Yes.  Mr Molefe.    Yes just hang on Mr Molefe.  I think you might wish to bring the microphone a little closer to you so that you are loud enough and you can keep your microphone on throughout.  It will – you do not have to switch it off when non-speaking or when he is speaking.  You can just keep it on all the time. Yes you can continue. I just want everyone to hear what you say properly – your voice must be at it loudest.    Yes.     Thank you, Mr Molefe.  I think there are certain parts of your statement which made me wish we had received it in advance to give it to certain people or at least warned them about it.   But I think I can understand that there may be different views about whether there would be a need to do that.  But maybe that – if I had – if we received it in advance, we would have preferred to err on the side of caution and given it.   So I just make this point to indicate that, to the extent that either you or your counsel might have taken the view that there is nothing that implicates anybody.  I am not criticising that.  I am not criticising that but ...[intervenes]      ...I may have preferred to err on the side of caution.  So I just wanted to make that point.  You want to say something before I proceed?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  That was the first point I wanted to make.  The second point I want to make is that.  I like the idea that you have taken the attitude that you want to assist the Commission as much as you can. And I think from the statement you have made, you have     I am sorry.  Before you proceed.  It would be good if I could have a copy of your statement Mr Molefe.     H’m.     Yes.  Mister ...[intervenes]      You have one that has – in which those minor errors had been corrected?     You do not have?  Ja.     Yes.     Okay.     Ja, what can be done is.  This one can be replaced.     With one that has been corrected.     Yes.     Yes, okay.  And so it can be replaced with a version that reflects that the errors have been corrected.     And I wanted to say.  Mr Seleka as well as Mr Masuku, separately and together, you can apply your minds as to whether this statement was the corrected one.     Can or should be admitted as an exhibit or not.  You do not have to, if you are not ready to say that now, you can tell me later in the day.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.  I think Mr Masuku wishes to say something on this point.     Well ...[intervenes]      Well, what are they preventing from going to the podium?     Because you wanted to go to the podium.     I think you must go to the podium.     Ja, why have they prevented you?  [laughs]  Just sanitise the podium and then you can use it.  But I am sure Mr Masuku, it is not any attempt to sabotaging you.  [laughs]       Said.     Ja.     Of what was said, ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Made an exhibit.     Yes.     Oh, okay.     Oh, okay.  Well ...[intervenes]      There are a lot of Molefe’s.  So.  [laughs]       [laughs]  You got him understand you have been confused.  [laughs]       Okay alright.  Taken – we take it that in reading the statement, which is not an affidavit, can we take it that Mr Molefe was doing so on the understanding that he is under oath, therefore.  Although it is a statement but – because I see he had already taken oath.       But I need to clarify it because he may have prepared it ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes, yes.     Into an affidavit, yes.     Ja, okay.     In his affidavit.     Yes.     [laughs]  Okay alright.     Thank you, Mr Masuku.  Oh, I did not realise...  I hope my watch is right.  I did not realise that we have gone past quarter past eleven.  It says half-past eleven.  Is that the right time?     Oh, okay.  So I think that we should take the tea-break now then, so that when we come back, then you can start leading Mr Molefe’s evidence.     We will take the tea adjournment now.  It is half-past.  We will resume at quarter to twelve.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, you may proceed, Mr Seleka.     I think I must just effectively make this announcement that going forward any witness who wishes to make remarks which are not in an affidavit or statement that has been given to the Commission already should forward his or her statement to the Commission at least seven days before the date of hearing and indicate that they would request to be allowed to read that statement at the Commission.  That will give the Commission and opportunity to look at it and see whether anybody should be alerted to it, advance on it.  So I just want to make that so that in the future …[intervenes]     …everybody knows what is going to happen.     Okay, alright, proceed.     The affidavit of Mr Brian Molefe starting at page 5 of Eskom bundle 17 is admitted together with its annexures as EXHIBIT U38.1. AFFIDAVIT OF MR BRIAN MOLEFE TOGETHER WITH ANNEXURES HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT U38.1     And dancing skills.     There will be no time for dancing.     Mr Molefe – Mr Seleka...     You see, Mr Masuku.  Yes, I think that quite a number of the initial pages of Mr Brian Molefe’s affidavit talks about matters that we do not have to deal with.     About whether his contract was one for an indefinite period or a fixed term and pension and so on because those matters have been dealt with in litigation.     So you do not have to deal with those, I think it is sufficient to deal with his secondment.     And when he started at Eskom on an acting basis and when he became – when he was appointed, then to go to the real issues.     Ja, okay, alright.       Because I think a lot of those matters have been dealt with in litigation.     But which there has a judgment.     I am sure he just wants the employer before the Eskom employer only.     I think it was 2011.     You joined Transnet in 2011, early, I think it may have been February or March or thereabout.     Yes, yes, but from …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.  I have read somewhere that you left PIC in 2010.  Is that incorrect?     But the importance of whether you left PIC 2010 relates to when exactly did you leave because I may have misunderstood you but I though you said you left PIC in 2008.     Oh, okay, alright.     Well, you have not worked for too many employers.  I would have thought that you would know these things easily because you were just in the Premier ’s office in Limpopo, you were in National Treasury, you were in PIC and then after that you were in Transnet.     Hey?     Using the black numbers on the top left of each – of a page.     Ja, the CV starts at page 46.     Ja, I think I was right, Mr Molefe.     Page 48 you CV says February 2011 to April 2015 you were Group Chief Executive of Transnet.     Ja, I was right about when you started at Transnet.     But what we do – what we need to see is when you left PIC.     H’m?     Not really.  I remember some things and I do not remember other things.     But I do not see – I do not know if you deal with PIC here.  You should be dealing with it but I cannot immediately see.     H’m?     What page?     Yes, yes.     Yes, I can see that, so I think …[intervenes]     Ja, I think I was right also that you left PIC in 2010.     Okay, alright.     Okay.     Okay.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes, okay.     I am sorry, I did not hear that first sentence.     Oh, okay.  Well, will it take five, ten minutes?     Much more than that?     Okay.     Well, let us first give you fifteen minutes and see whether that will do.       Tell us – yes.     Dr?     Sam Motsuenyane     Okay.     He was saying in effect look what I did under very difficult conditions.     With hostility coming from the Reserve Bank  and it was apartheid government, now you have an ANC government,  you have the ANC here, you have a governor of the Reserve Bank who has the background of the ANC, he is black …[intervenes]     The conditions are – should be much more easier for you to achieve these things.     Yes, yes.     He was saying what is your problem?     Ja, why are you failing?     Yes.     Ja.     Do not speak too far away from your mic.     Ja, okay.     Yes.     H’m  Mr Seleka?     Please look this side so I can hear.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Are you able to remember when it was you started interacting with them while you were at PIC?  From around which year?     Ja, okay.     Okay.  No, that is fine.      We will not hold you to it, ja, okay, continue.     I am sorry Mr Seleka, I know I am interrupting you, before you get to Tegeta let me ask some question to Mr Molefe.  So you started interacting with the Gupta Brothers, Gupta family around 2008, that’s your estimate, 2007/2008 you are not sure.     And you said earlier on you have been to their house and I think you said many times, is that right?     I think you said many times is that right?     Several times.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     No that is fine.  I assume that as the years went by from around 2007 to 2008 when you started interacting with them did your relationship with them get stronger, did you get closure in terms of the personal relationship or professional, whatever it was?     Yes of course.     You interacted with them.     Yes.     Ja.     Okay, Mr Seleka?     At?     Mmm.     You say it is Indian ladies?     Did you say Indian ladies?     Okay.     No, no.     No, no there is nothing wrong in being – in say look I can’t comment, I don’t where he got that information from, if that is – ja, there is nothing wrong with that if you don’t know, but if you – you may well have an idea where he might have got that from in which case you will say, but when you have no idea you have no idea.     Hmm?     What?  [laughing]     Did you know people that know him from whom he might have got that information as far as you know or you have no reason to think that he got it from anybody that you knew?     You don’t know where, ja.     No, no that is fair enough, part of the reason why Mr Seleka is asking is that so that if you do know something you can share it.  If you don’t know you don’t know, but I think we may as well mention this even though it might relate to Transnet and you might be able to deal with it, you might – if you say you would prefer to deal with it when you come back and deal with Transnet that would be fine.     And I want to say you would know I assume that in 2010, December the New Age, which was a newspaper owned by the Guptas ran an article, had an article, I don’t know if it was December 6 or December 10 10 which was either saying Mr Brian Molefe is going to be the next Group CEO of Transnet or the next boss of Transnet or whether it was simply saying it is likely that Mr Brian Molefe is going to be the next Group CEO of Transnet.     Have you heard about that article?     Yes, yes, you don’t know where they got that information from?     Sorry?     I have read the article if I recall correctly, but I cannot remember whether – probably I don’t think they would say, they might say certain reliable sources had told them.     I am sure it should show, the – I think the legal team can just make arrangements to make a copy of that article available to Mr Molefe.     Well the Commission investigations are ongoing, but the – what I wanted you to be able to say something about if you are able to, is to say we have a situation where it seems in 2010 a newspaper that is owned by the Gupta family or their entities seems to predict that you are going to be the next Group CEO of Transnet and it actually that does happen and then in 2014 according to Mr Hank Bester who gave evidence here he meets with Mr Salim Essa on some issue relating to Transnet, business or contract, and Mr Salim Essa wants Mr Bester ’s company to work with his company and according to Mr Bester in an attempt to show that they, I assume Mr Salim Essa and whoever else he was talking about, are powerful people, he decided to tell him that you know we know that the – Mr Brian Molefe is going to be the next boss of Eskom and in less than a year that does happen, so you might say look I don’t have a comment, I don’t know where that came from, that is fine, but it is fair to just say there is this, do you have something to say about, do you know anything about it.     Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka?     Keep your mic on Mr Molefe, ja just put it on.     I didn’t hear that.     [laughing] yes.     I assume it was closed because of load shedding.     Transnet or Eskom? MR     She called back and said?     Okay ja, your move to Eskom.   We know that she made the announcement I think on the 17 t h of April 2015.     Yes, so even if you don’t remember the exact date when she – that is now Minister Brown, raised this issue with you for the first time, how long before the 17 t h of April do you think it was how much time lapsed between the time when she raised it for the first time with you and the end when it was announced?     A week or a week and a half.     From what you say it looks like she was the first person to mention the possibility of you moving to Eskom.     Is your – would it be fair to say your understanding was that she managed the whole process of your move from Transnet to Eskom.     Okay.     Ja, okay, thank you.  Mr Seleka?     He was a cabinet minister at some stage before that as well. MR     ...[Indistinct – speaking simultaneously and at some stage.     In Japan?     While he was ambassador.     I think Mr Seleka you may have understood her evidence like that, but I understood her – I think I understood her to be saying at the meeting the person who raised the subject was Dr Ngubane which I didn’t necessarily understand to be – to say there may not have been discussions prior to that meeting which he might have known nothing about.      Ja.     Yes, yes, I think Dr Ngubane’s evidence seems to be consistent with Mr Molefe’s evidence.     Because Mr Molefe says the first person who raised this issue with him of moving to Eskom was Minister Brown.     Dr Ngubane said that the idea that Mr Molefe should be moved to Eskom came from Minister Brown.     So ...[intervenes]      ...I think that’s consistent ja.     Ja, no, no, no that is fine, ja, ja.    Yes.  Yes.    Hm.    Ja.  No, no, no but you remember we spoke about perspectives even if it is the same facts.  Part of this is for you to be able to say well I do not know about this and that but there is a flaw in this risk game when you try to connect this and this and this as I see it.  So I was not there but this does not connect.  So that perspective.  But if you say look I do not think that this means anything really.  I  mean that is -  that is fine.    Ja.   Well maybe we for the sake of completeness we may as well also mention this and if you have got something to say you can use the opportunity to say if you really have nothing to say you can – you do not have to say anything that in – according to Mr Mcebesi Jonas.    Ja he gave evidence in the commission and said he had a meeting at the Gupta residence on the 23 October 2015.    He said Mr Duduzane Zuma was in that meeting, Mr Hlongwane was in that meeting – Fana Hlongwane and he said there was a Gupta brother that was there.  I think initially he said it as Mr Ajay Gupta but I think later on he said he was not sure about whether it was Mr Ajay Gupta or one of the other brothers.   But what did emerge through the investigation of the commission I think is that – and I think Mr Duduzane Zuma accepted is that Mr Tony Gupta was in the house on the day of that meeting.  But Mr Duduzane Zuma and Mr Hlongwane their version is Mr Tony Gupta was not part of the meeting he popped in at some stage and wanted to speak to – to Mr Duduzane Zuma. But he was not part of the meeting. But Mr Jonas was adamant that there was a Gupta brother who was having a meeting with him.  He said the two namely Duduzane Zuma and Mr Hlongwane were quiet most of the time.  It was just that Gupta brother and himself were talking. One of the things that he said they – the Gupta    Well he said the Gupta brother was part of the meeting.    Sorry.    No, no, no.  The person that Mr Jonas said said these things about you was the Gupta brother that he said he was having a meeting with.    No, no.    Yes.  I do not want to – to say took care but – of your career but I think in my recollection of Mr Jonas’ evidence is that it was something like your career is taken care of.  Maybe not necessarily by them but your career is – you will be fine in terms of career. But let us complete the whole thing because we have now talked about it.  I mean I do not know what finding I will make about Mr Jonas’ evidence and Mr Duduzane’s evidence and Mr Hlongwane’s evidence about that meeting.  What I will ultimately find to be the case. But if I were to find that indeed Mr Jonas was told these things by a Gupta brother in that meeting and he was made the offer that he said he was made that if he agreed to be Minister of Finance and work with them bla, bla, bla it may well be that the – and the fact that that Gupta brother seems to have known in October already that Minister Nene was going to fired as Minister of Finance.   It may well be that it would be reasonable to say it looks like the Gupta brothers were looking to get a Minister of Finance for the – for the government who would meet with their approval. And I have heard evidence about Mr Van Rooyen who was appointed as Mr Nene’s successor.  He has given evidence here as well.  He indicated the number of interactions that he had with I think one or other of the Gupta brothers between October and December before he was appointed and there has been evidence about the advisors that he appointed that is Mr Van Rooyen. And there is the investigation of the commission led it to ask some of the people who were officials of the ANC in March 2017 I think that is when Mr Gordhan was fired as Minister of Finance.    Asked what reasons Mr Zuma may have told them why he was firing Mr Gordhan and they filed affidavits Mr Mantashe, Dr Zweli Mkize was Treasurer General at the time.  Mr Mantashe was SG and Ms Jessie Duarte they filed affidavits which are within the commission and if you have not been given copies you should be given of copies. One of the things they say is that yes Mr Zuma did discuss or tell them his plan to fire or leave out of cabinet Mr Gordhan and they say he told them that he wanted to replace Mr Gordhan as Minister of Finance with you.  And they say in those affidavits the officials of the ANC all rejected that idea.  And we do know of course that the person who are – who replaced Mr Gordhan as Minister of Finance was then Mr Gigaba. And in the meantime I think in February 2017 if I am not mistaken you became a member of Parliament National Assembly for a few months.  I think in May you resigned and went back to Eskom.    So you might be able to say, look I have no comment really on these things but I mention them and if you have not been given the affidavits that I am talking about arrangements should be made for you to have been – to be given and if you want to say let me read the affidavits first and deal with this issue later when I come back that is acceptable as well.    Well I do not think it is fair to say it was gossiping because this was the President of the country Mr Zuma and President of the ANC talking to his – to the top leadership of the ANC the Top 5 – Top 6 to say this is what I am planning to do.  And I guess he was confronting them.    Yes.    But I do not think it is fair to say they were gossiping.    I am sure you talk about a lot of other people when they are not there but you would not say you were gossiping all the time.    No, no, no that – there is a…    No, no the idea.    No as I say    Well you see as I say you know you might say, look I know nothing about it and I have no comment about it.  Or you might have some comment.  But a possible scenario might be that you might say I do not know.  You might say, well I am not surprised that Mr Zuma mentioned to the officials of the ANC that he was – he wanted to – they wanted me to replace Mr Gordhan because he had actually contacted me and asked me whether I would be prepared and I said I would be prepared so I am not surprised. But you might say I am surprised because nobody ever talked about that to me.  So the idea is just to enable you to say what you might know about these things.    Okay alright thank you.    Well Mr Seleka I just realised we have gone over one o’clock.    I think let us take the lunch adjournment.    We are at nine minutes past one we will resume at ten past two.    We adjourn.     We are supposed to continue but we are unable to continue because we have received news that somebody that works closely with me has tested positive with Covid-19.   It seems that in those circumstances, because I am required to isolate myself, that we cannot proceed in this form.  I took the trouble during lunch to ask Mr Seleka to share the information with Mr Masuku and an oral consent – I understand that there is an agreement that that is what should happen.  Namely, we should adjourn.  Is that confirmed?     Yes, to Mr Masuku.  You confirm?  Ja.       Okay.  It is unfortunate but it is the reality that we are faced with now and we have to find ways of how better to handle the situation because if each time somebody that has been in close contact with me tests positive, the hearings of the Commission have got to be disrupted, then it could pose quite a problem for the Commission’s work and us finishing in the time within which we must finish. So I think that, from my side, I think we should explore the possibility that if all concerned are available sometime next week on one of the days, we could explore the possibility of having the hearing via a video link or via Zoom from – and I would be sitting in my place of isolation.  So we must explore that and see whether it is possible. Obviously, because next week was not planned, that will only happen if Mr Molefe is available, his legal team is available.  I am saying next week, we could find a day where we could do that, because the Commission has been informed by the attorneys representing the former President, Mr Zuma, that he will not be appearing before the Commission next week. He says that should not in any way be seen as disrespect on his part for any legal process.  It seems that he says it is because he believes the review application that he has lodged should be finalised first. And that also, there is the matter that is in the Constitutional Court which has not been finalised.  I am not trying to exhaust every reason that he gives, but I think it is fair to give, at least mention that those are the main reasons he gives through his lawyers. So we know that he is not going to be here next week.  So it would be good if there is a way of using it, at least some of the days.   So I do not know whether Mr Seleka you had any chance to speak to Mr Masuku, but if you have not, maybe a discussion can be had after to see what is possible and what is not possible about sometime next week in relation to continuing with Mr Molefe’s evidence but via Zoom or something.     Ja.     Ja.  No, no, no.  That is fine.     The idea is that we should all talk about it and see whether ...[intervenes]      ...we all think it is something that can or should be done ...[intervenes]      ...or not.     You know.  There might be something that one is overlooking.     It is just that one, it is trying to make sure that there is as little disruption to the hearings as possible.     Given the time constraint – limited time available.     But obviously, that assumes that one is in isolation but is not feeling unwell.     That assumes that one is okay.     And...  Ja.  Maybe Mr Masuku wishes to say something?     [laughs]  I am thinking Mr Masuku you     Ja.  No, no, no.  That is true.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja, yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, okay, okay.     Ja.  No, no, no.  That will be done, ja.     Ja, ja, ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.  No, no.  It is.     Do not fix anything so far at this stage.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     [laughs]       Well, when I saw the letter, I wanted to say to you – I wanted to say, you know – you do not have to take the fifth amendment.  [laughs]       [laughs]       No, that is fine.  So I think that is a fair – those are fair points.  We will adjourn.  And if we end up being able to use some of – sometime next week, good.  But if we end up not being able because of whatever, it is fine.     As we go along, we are learning in terms of how to best handle the situation.  And maybe, if and when it happens next time, I hope it never happens, but if it does happen, we might be better prepared in terms of some of the things that can be done.  I am sorry that we cannot continue but it is one of those things that one has no control over.     Ja, ja.  Okay.  No, thank you.     Ja?     Yes.       Oh, ja.     Ja, ja.  The one that we arranged for Tuesday.     Ja, that will have to be cancelled for now.     And the one that was this evening ...[intervenes]      Ja, ja, ja.     Okay alright.  We will talk early next week and see.  Maybe Tuesday and see how things look.     Ja, ja.     Okay alright.     Yes?     [laughs]       [laughs]       [laughs]  No.  Thank you very much Mr Masuku.     [laughs]       [laughs]  Okay no that is right.  Mr Molefe, I am sorry that we cannot proceed but obviously you understand the situation.     Yes, yes.  Arrangements will be made for the Commission to continue with your evidence as soon as possible.  Ja.  Okay.  Thank you very much.   Then I have announced that for next week Mr Zuma will not be appearing before the Commission in terms of the letter that the Commission has received from his attorneys.   But the week after next.  If one is able to work and then one is fine, it will be – we will hear evidence relating to state security.  That is the week after next week.  Alright.  thank you very much.  We will then adjourn for the day.     We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson.    We are ready Chairperson.    Chairperson today is the hearing of or the leading of testimony of Mr Brian Molefe.  Mr Molefe is legally represented. I would allow the legal representatives to place themselves on record.    Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson Mr Molefe is here I envisage that he is ready to take the oath or affirmation.    Thank you Chairperson.    Chairperson the bundle we will be using is Exhibit Eskom Bundle 17 – 17 Exhibit U38.  Exhibit U38 that is where you find Mr Molefe’s affidavit together with the annexures.  Mr Molefe I will ask you to go there as well.  Oh my learned friend Mr Masuku seeks to put certain things on record Chairperson.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Yes Mr Molefe I should say at the outset that his names features in many things.  A couple of issues from Transnet to Eskom and to Parliament but his called by the Eskom work stream Chairperson to focus on matters that pertain Eskom. And that deals with Mr Molefe’s secondment – how he was seconded to Tran – to Eskom from Transnet.  Deals with Mr Molefe’s decision making in regard to what he found to be the cooperation agreement and the fourth addendum between Eskom and Optimum.  How he dealt with that.  He will explain in regard to the decisions he made. And to the extent that he can and I know that he was not personally involved in certain decisions regarding the two pre-payments decisions. The R1.68 billion decision that was made by the board and the R659 million pre-payment decision made by the board. He can explain to the extent he can and he will also deal with the penalties that were – that Eskom sought to impose against OCM and how that matter ultimately got resolved. Together with that Chairperson is the interaction between Eskom and the DMR on the one hand and in particular the approach Mr Molefe and Dr Ngubane makes to Mr Ramatlhodi in regard to that. Mr Molefe has indicated to me that he would like to traverse other issues particularly in regard to the PP – the Public Protectors Report but he will do so in due course. Chairperson there are other matters that might crop up during the – the leading of his evidence and if Mr Molefe is not ready on those we have indicated or agreed with him that he would ask for your permission to either file an affidavit seek for more time in order to deal with those matters.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    Correct.    That is correct I have conveyed that much also to Mr Molefe and the legal team.    Thank you Chair.  Should I…    No I am ready to start Chairperson.    I could identify the file and …    Thank you Chair.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Molefe and I had a collegial exchange ...[intervenes]      Yes.  I was going to say.     And my learned friend has indicated, he wants to give us.     Chair, I think my inclination will be that it has to.     Because it makes reference to certain persons.     The two in particular.     And I think in all fairness to them.     Once it is accepted, it has to be served on them.     So that that part of what he said about them does not remain a mere statement.     In the opening address.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.       Thank you, Chairperson.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Eskom bundle 17, Chairperson, EXHIBIT U38.  That is the bundle we will be using.  EXHIBIT U38 contains Mr Molefe’s affidavit and it starts on page 5.  Mr Molefe, again the black pagination, the top left hand corner.  You are there, Mr Molefe?     Thank you.  The affidavit, Chairperson, runs up to page 38.  Mr Molefe, please go to page 38.  38, go to page 38.  Yes.  So that is the last page of the affidavit.  You see the signature there above the name Brian Molefe?     You confirm that to be your signature?     You confirm this entire affidavit to be your affidavit?     Thank you, Mr Molefe.  Chairperson, may I beg leave to have it admitted as EXHIBIT U38.1.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Chairperson, Mr Molefe and I had a friendly discussion this morning and I told him that Dr Ngubane remembers him for his charisma and dance.     Ja and he said he will give us a treat but now he took a long time in his address so I will simply go straight to the evidence.     Absolutely, Chair.  Ja, thank you, Mr Molefe.  Ample evidence has been led before us about your secondment to Transnet – I mean, to Eskom from Transnet.  Could you tell the Chairperson about – a little bit about when you …[intervenes]     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Indeed, Chair.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Molefe, so …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, yes.  No, I have indicated that much, Chair, the pension payout will not be traversed in his evidence.  But, Mr Molefe, you could just before you go into the secondment, just tell the Chairperson your previous employment prior to coming to Eskom.  If you do not follow my question you will ask, is it not?     Yes.     When was that, Mr Molefe?     After 2008?  After 2008 where did you go?     Oh, let me ask you this, when did you join Transnet?     2010?     That is on page 46.     Page 46.     Yes.      On which page?     It is there, Chair.     It is there.  It is there, Chair.     It is there.     It has June 2003 to July 2010, Chief Executive Officer of Public Investment Corporation.  On the same page.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Just by way of a background, Mr Molefe, the Gupta brothers, Mr Salim Essa, have become the highlight of the day and just by way of a background could you explain to the Chairperson, starting first with the Gupta brothers, whether you had – you knew them, you had any relationship with them, of what kind?     Can you also tell the Chairperson according to your recollection when did you come to know them?     Ja, while Mr Molefe is thinking, Chair…     Mr Molefe, sorry.  I was saying to the Chairperson while you are thinking I must remind you that your pilot experience and estimation of time should not fail me.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  So the interaction with them, it is a while back when you were at PIC and it seems in that process, as you say, you came to know them very well.  Yes.  But just keep your microphone on.     They also tried to do deals there.     Yes.     And talking about deals, sorry I am just going out of sequence a bit but we will come to it, talking about deals Mr Molefe we know that at least that at Eskom Tegeta reach was having links with the Gupta Brothers.     They would get deals at Eskom.      They did.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Molefe being so far as Mr Salim Essa is concerned I did say that I will ask you this question about Mr Hank Bester.     Remember Mr Hank Bester says he had a meeting in 2014 with Mr Salim Essa.     And during the course of that meeting Mr Salim Essa said to show you how powerful we are, or something to that effect, we have decided that Mr Brian Molefe is going to be the CEO of Eskom.    That is 2014 before the announcement for your secondment ...[intervenes]       2014.     Yes.  So how is it that he knew you and you say you didn’t know him based on that instant.     Yes Mr Salim Essa and you can tell the Chairperson what you said you are going to say.     What you say will be your response to that question.     Is that in 2014.     Yes.     Thank you Chair.  Mr Molefe let us deal with your secondment because it has also come up here a couple of times from – your secondment from Transnet to Eskom.  Tell the Chairperson how did that come about, who approaches you, and what did they say to you?     I am giving you two minutes.     Who asked you?      Minister Brown, Lynne Brown?     Yes that is correct.     Thank you.  Mr Molefe during that time did you know or even prior to that time did you know Dr Ngubane?     Face the Chairperson.     Face to the Chairperson.     What name did you use, the first time you interacted with who?     Oh is that the name you used, I thought you used a different name.     The reason I am asking is because Ms Matsietsi Mohkolo says prior to the decision being made for you to be seconded the Minister, Minister Lynne Brown, gets called to a meeting at Eskom with Dr Ngubane.  At the time he is an acting Chairperson of Eskom Board.  In that meeting when they arrived, that is the Minister and Ms Mohkolo, they find the Chairperson of Transnet, Ms Linda Mambaso, they find Dr Ngubane, and Mr Sithemba Khoza who was at the time the Acting CEO.    And according to her impression the person who introduces the idea of your secondment to Eskom is Dr Ngubane, so that is the reason I am asking you did you know Dr Ngubane at the time?      Yes.      Yes, no that is a fair assessment Chair because I must also say in addition to that Chairperson the same question was put to Dr Ngubane and Dr Ngubane said this was a follow-up meeting according to him, so there was a meeting before and this was a follow up meeting.  According to Dr Ngubane it was the Minister who asked him to second you, who suggested that you be seconded to Eskom.     Correct.     Yes.     Minister Brown.     No that is alright.   Ja, because just for your information, I am not – you may comment or you may not be able to, you see how the dots connect it is because the central figure – you’re laughing – the central figure in this is Mr Salim Essa who as we have already indicated to you the evidence of Mr Hank Bester in 2014 who says this is what Mr Salim Essa said, we have already decided that Mr Molefe will be the CEO of Eskom.  Then you have on the 10 t h of March 2015 when Ms Suzanne Daniels ...[indistinct – word[s] cut off] Melrose Arch.  Mr Salim Essa introduces himself as the Minister’s advisor to her and that refers to Minister Lynne Brown. Then you have again the involvement of Mr Essa when Mr Tsotsi does the composition of the sub-committees of the Eskom board.  That Mr Essa proposes to him who should be on those sub-committees and Minister Lynne Brown gives Mr Tsotsi the same names or list of names that had been received from Mr Salim Essa. And Mr Tsotsi is called to the Minister’s office where according to him he finds the Minister with Mr Tony Gupta and Mr Salim Essa and the Minister insists on a particular list for the composition of the sub-committees. So when the Minister then comes to you it seems that there is more than just the Minister behind the decision for your secondment.  You may want to comment or you have no comment?  I am just painting the picture to you.    Okay.    Yes.    I think it is very [00   Ja.    Ja.  I think…    Yes.  No thank you Chair.  Yes…    Especially…    Thank you Chair.  Yes I – one should emphasise that Mr Molefe there is a process of investigation in gathering information.  Ultimately the law makes a decision based on the evidence presented if it is uncontroverted.   But the decision is not made based on reading the stars or making imaginations.  So we are in the process and the end will be based on the evidence. Now in addition to the secondment issue.    Oh we have gone.  Yes Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Thank you Chair.     That is confirmed Chairperson.  I did convey the message to my ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      Yes.  We did have a chance to speak about that Chair.  We – I know my learned friend was expressing, what, some advice on that, I would say.  And maybe he could be given an opportunity.  Is that right?  To address the Chairperson.       He is fine but he thinks we should consider some factors ...[intervenes]      ...that might require us to self-isolate and...     That is fine.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes, correct.     As possible.     Yes.     Correct.     That is one of the things.     Ja.     Chair.     We – from the Eskom work stream, we were going to have two evening sessions.  So those sessions will also be impacted.       Ms Goodson.     And Ms Naidoo.     Tuesday.     Yes.     We were going to explore in regard to Ms Naidoo, yes.     Ja.     Yes.       Okay.       I told mister...     I told Mr Masuku that his attorneys wrote the letter prematurely Chair.  So...     [laughs]  They would have taken advantage.  [laughs]       They take their hand too soon.     Thank you, Chair.   
ADV MASUKU: Deputy Chief Justice together with Mr Tsheppe and Mr Sikhakhane on the instructions of Mr – of Molefe Attorneys.  We appear for Mr Brian Molefe.    Deputy Chief Justice thank you for allowing me to raise these preliminary issues.  They are raised not to create the impression that something is wrong. But in a process like this these issues ought to be raised so that the process is then reached and it is – it is made a little stronger. I have been asked to raise – I have been asked and have a duty to raise those issues which concern – which concern the appearance of the Mr Brian. The first is that Eskom has a – has filed a civil claim to the amount of I think of R3 billion against Mr Brian and I think eleven other defendants on the very issues that will be canvassed by the commission today. So to the extent that some of the issues – some of the questions may undermine his defence in the civil claim we might raise an objection.  We hope it does not have to come to that – to that level but he would be entitled to raise a defence on the basis that this would – it is not – it is – it would be unfair in light of the – in light of the pending litigation that is going on on the very same issues that he is canvassing. The second one you will be aware Chief Justice that the President has made a proclamation I think it was 2019 if I am not wrong in respect of which a full scale investigation was – or was ordered by the President the SIU must conduct in relation to the Eskom matters. And we – Mr Molefe informs us that he has been informed that there are people who worked with him have been asked for affidavits in relation to that investigation and at some point the SIU or whoever is investigating this issue will confront Mr Molefe on the – on those aspects. We would ask that where it is possible his right to – his right to not incriminate himself be respected if it is raised legitimately and we hope we do raise it legitimately. And then the last issue really is an issue of – you know if – having been here a number times Chief Justice if I do not complain it is just not right.  So I am going to complain about…    Yes.  I am going to complain about the fact that we did receive the documents on which Mr Molefe had to prepare for this hearing quite late – it was on Tuesday – Tuesday night. We as legal representatives were able to access those documents the following day which was a Wednesday and we only really had Wednesday and Thursday and part of – well today is Friday to go through the documents that had been sent to it. It does create a problem for Mr Molefe because one of the questions we had asked quite early was which aspect – in which – in respect of which position was the commission seeking to have Mr Molefe come and testify?   Because the – the I think it is the Regulation 10.3 Notice does not really point out that he is fact testifying on the Eskom issues and that issue became clearer when we received the letter that I commended and the letter by Mr Seleka which was a very polite and very fruitful letter to engage with. So we do want to say that there is invariably prejudice that relates to the detail that he may require from Mr Molefe in respect of the issues that he got documents late on. So in that respect we would ask that if he does say that he has not engaged with certain aspects of your question that you allow him the opportunity to do so in writing after having gotten enough time with his lawyers to engage with those questions that you would be wishing him to engage with. So because I mean subject to any questions that you may to just assist those are the remarks that I thought are important to record so that we understand the context in which Mr Molefe is going to be giving his evidence. It is the context of a civil and criminal liability that he is facing and the context in which the documents had been sent to him by the commission and the limited time that he had to prepare for those documents. Absolutely the final one Chief Justice he does want to have this – he has a statement that he wants to make in which he – it may clarify his mind about the things that the commission is investigating.  If it is permitted Mr Brian is ready to give that statement.    Thank you Deputy Justice. 
MR MOLEFE:  Good morning Chairperson.    Brian Molefe.    No objections.    I will.    I truly affirm.     Thank you Chairperson.  Let me start by expressing my gratitude for allowing me to crave your indulgence in making the statement. Chairperson during the testimony of Dr Ben Ngubane you asked a pertinent question which in my opinion if answered will put into context and clarify the events that took place at Eskom during my tenure there in 15 and 2016.    I do not want to talk into it and give the whole Covid.      Chairperson during that testimony you referred to a question that needs to be put to Optimum     Chairperson ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chairperson.  Mr Ramaphosa is mentioned in my affidavit of May 2020.  Not only mention him, I also talk about this issue of the shares and so on.  I do not know if, after reading that affidavit on how seriously that affidavit was taken.     If there were any further investigations.     What surprised me.     is that there was no follow-up.     There is nothing.  Even in the papers that I received on Tuesday.     Nothing says we would like to talk about this issue.     This issue that I consider to be the most critical.     I am not raising it for the first time.     In my affidavit.     Yes, I am, sir.     Yes, Chairperson.     Yes it is indeed, Chairperson.     Yes and I also confirm that it was signed on the 13 May 2020.     Yes, no, it just occurred to me how far back you wanted to go but …[intervenes]     Yes, yes.     So I was – I worked in the office of the Premier in Limpopo, under Premier Mangoro(?) Matlhodi(?) as a Chief Director for Strategic Planning.  I have worked in the National Treasury as a director in the budget office dealing with provincial budgets and I was promoted again to Chief Director dealing with provincial budgets and then I became – sorry, asset management, Chief Director Asset Management which was actually about state owned entities, the assets were the state owned entities.   In fact while I was there it was during the time when the PFMA was being written and I was in part of the committee that wrote the parts of the PFMA that relate to state owned entities and I promoted to Deputy Director General, asset and liability management, where we managed the debt, South Africa’s debt both in domestic and international capital markets, the issuing of bonds in the domestic capital market and the issuing of bonds in the international capital markets to finance the deficit.   We also did cash management and the Chief Director who was now doing asset management also reported to me, so it was state owned entities and debt management. And then I was sent to the Public Investments Commissioners at the time as a secretary for the Commission. We started a process to change the legislation to convert the Public Investments Commissioners into a corporation because really the PIC was an asset management company and we wanted to professionalise it and when I was …[intervenes]     I went to the PIC I think in 2000 or 2001.  I was there until about 2008.  I was there for seven years.  The Public Investment Corporation Act was passed in 2004 and while I was there, we were managing assets – when I joined, assets under management were about R310 billion and by the time I left in 2008, assets under management were about R950 billion, just short of one trillion.   Subsequently, I think about a year after I left, the assets went over one trillion and they stayed about one trillion.  And …[intervenes]     After 2008 for about a year I decided maybe I was going to do my own thing and do some private transactions by myself.     I think it was 2010.     H’m.     Was it 2011?  Yes, thereabouts, yes.     Chairperson, I may make mistakes but I have submitted my CV, which has accurate details.     I must apologise.     I might have left the PIC in 2009 then and went to Transnet in 2011.     But I remember there was about 18 months where I was just doing gardening.     It is possible because at the time when I was leaving the PIC I kept saying to the board that I would like to leave and they kept saying stay for another six months, stay for another three months, stay – my contract had ended.     Chair, we can go through my CV.     Which is an annexure and I think it is more accurate.     But we only started there, Chairperson?     That is where we started.     Sorry?     46?     46.     Yes.  2011, 2015 at Transnet and June 03 to July 2010 at Public Investments Corporation.  I am sorry, Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Your memory is impeccable, Chairperson.     I say your memory is impeccable.     On page 48?     Where it says work experience.       So it starts with Eskom, it goes to Transnet then it goes to PIC.     Yes, yes.     That is correct.     I feel like, Chairperson, let me start with Salim Essa because I think it is easier.  I actually do not know Salim Essa.  I have never met him.  I do not know what he looks like.  I hear about him.   The Gupta brothers I know and I know all three of them but the one that I know – that I had a lot of interactions with was in fact Mr Ajay Gupta and not his two brothers.  And ja, I know Mr Ajay Gupta, I have been to his house.  I have been to their house and I have been there on numerous occasions to attend family functions, to have private meetings, a lot of times, so I know them.  I know them quite well, especially Mr Ajay Gupta.     So I will not try to say to you that I do not know them.     Like it is fashionable to do.     Chairperson, it is a very long story and – but I believe you have the time.     I say it is a very long story.     No, more.     Yes.     The Commission will go over budget.     Yes.     While I was at the PIC I was called by Dr Motsuenyane.     Motsuenyane, Sam Motsuenyane..     Yes.     And he asked me to come to his house on a Saturday afternoon and we sat under a tree and they made us tea and he told me a very long story, long painful story.  He said to me that in 1964 an idea occurred to him that part of the problem that African people were not progressing was access to credit and yet they were classified as high risks by the bank and yet the money that was in the banks was theirs because they made deposits. So he says it occurred to him that maybe what he should do is establish a bank that would be an African Bank.  In fact that is what it was called.  And he says he went around all the townships and villages in South Africa trying to establish a bank.  Trying to establish a bank and there were no hotels there.  In fact, the hotels that were there did not take black people in the ‘60’s and the ‘70’s and he slept in people’s houses and told them about this idea of establishing a bank and they donated money towards the establishment of the bank, these business people who owned cafes and butcheries and African people that were not allowed to be involved in manufacturing by legislation at the time. So it took him 10 years to raise R1 million with which to establish a bank and then when he had raised that R1 million, he says he spoke to the ANC about it and they gave their blessings but also directed him to go to London and speak to Barclays and he did.  And Barclays said we will help you and they gave him the R9 million and he came to South Africa and he had R10 million with which to establish a bank. Now he came to South Africa and had to apply for banking licence from the Reserve Bank and the Reserve Bank  did not refuse him, they gave him a banking licence with Barclays but put onerous conditions including the board membership of the bank and all sorts of things.  It was incidentally headquartered in Ga-Rankuwa, which is where I am from and I remember it very well, it was in Zone 16, next to the cinema there, Makoko(?) So he says because of the conditions of the Reserve Bank  the bank struggled.  For example, they were not allowed to open current accounts and yet their clients were business people from the township.  They had to come and withdraw cash to go to Makro – to Metro and to Makro every Friday to buy stock.  So they could not just go and sign cheques there and it was very painful experience under the supervision of a very hostile Reserve Bank at the time. But a long story short, Chairperson, his point was Molefe, you are now CEO of the PIC, it controls so many billion rands, the Governor of the Reserve Bank is a black man who comes from the ANC and the ANC is in power, the ANC that had bought into this idea in the first place in the ‘70’s and [indistinct – speaking African language] which means [indistinct – speaking African language], what is so difficult for you guys?   And, Chairperson, that was also a very, very – I took those words to heart and I went back to the PIC and I think it was …[intervenes]     Exactly.     The president of the …[intervenes]     Exactly.  To achieve this thing, to capture the saving of African people.     With the purpose of reinvesting them.  Reinvesting them, to advance and improve the conditions.     He says – ja.  Actually, he did not say what it is - [indistinct – speaking African language].  I think what is your problem is mild.   [indistinct] is [indistinct].     Why are you failing?       Yes, yes.  So, Chairperson, I mean, it gave me sleepless nights and I came back and thought about this thing.  At about the same time there was a rumour that Nedbank is for sale and I decided that maybe what we should do is take Nedbank and transform it into this bank that Mr Motsuenyane was talking about. So I mulled over the idea.  I contacted Nedbank, it is owned by Old Mutual.  They confirmed that Nedbank was indeed for sale.  They had advised we were supposed to oversee the sale, expressed my interest and they agreed and they said but Molefe, can you raise the capital?  I said I will try.  And I left the PIC to go on this mission and I went to London to speak to people there about doing this and I even thought of maybe we could buy some other banks like Standard – not Standard Bank, the one that is outside South Africa.     Ja, I remember it now, but it is Standard something.  But, anyway …[intervenes]     But the Chairperson just gave me...     Ja.  But, Chairperson, in South Africa there was a family that had come from India, had established themselves as business people and had opened a computer company and – well, I heard that they were doing quite well and I went to them and I asked, if one wants to establish a bank, what – where can one get the capital?  How can one raise the capital to establish such a bank?  And they said that is very interesting.  You know, in India we have banks that are Indian-owned, that our banks like Bank of Baroda and several others, let us speak to some people in England – I mean, in India, to see if they will be able to assist and they did.   I am not sure if I should mention who they spoke to but they spoke to one of the richest people in India.  I met him.  I am just reluctant to release his name now.  And he agreed and he said we will do the deal. After five minutes of discussion, he said I will help buy a bank.  I was happy, I was elated.  And we went to the Reserve Bank with this person and the Guptas and Mr Ajay Gupta.  And we got to the Reserve Bank and banking supervision said no, we cannot allow this to happen, Nedbank cannot be sold, we have already sold Standard Bank to the Chinese.  We have already sold ABSA to the English. I remember when the Barclays Bank came to the PIC, when I was CEO, to say that they would like to buy ABSA and I said to them I did not think that the Anglo Boer War would end like this. Any anyway, but then the Reserve Bank  was reluctant to proceed and with the Reserve Bank reluctant to proceed – the Governor was Mr Mboweni.  I do not know if I am implicating him, but he was Mr Mboweni.  And I even saw him – we had a code for this.  If you ask him what is the Groblersdal minute, he will tell you what it is.  It was about a black bank, it was about buying Nedbank. So it was turned down by the Reserve Bank, so we did not proceed and so I was left – then I thought I would establish a property company.  I spoke to Investec and they were prepared to help in however way they could help.  And then one day …[intervenes]     Yes, Chair.     And then one day I got a call.  Not from the Guptas, from a head-hunter called Brian – now I am talking – what am I – I am talking about Transnet now.  Oh, how I know the Guptas.  Okay, that is how I know them, Chairperson.  That is  - why now I am going to Transnet.  Now I am going to how I went to Transnet.     But that is how I got to know them.  We were doing this deal.     And right through the years, Chairperson, we never stopped talking about this bank.  And even up to today, I am still talking about it.  And even up to today, I am still on that mission, Chairperson, of Dr Motsuenyane.  Hopefully before he passes on we can make him proud.     I can also mention that while I was at the PIC they also tried to do deals there.     Ja, at the PIC.     They tried to do deals with PIC, they submitted funding applications.     And they were not approved while I was there.     There is not a single deal that they did with the PIC when I was there.     Chairperson, maybe around 2007/2008.     As you have seen, I cannot even remember my own life.     Ja.     Yes.     They did.     Yes.     Pardon?     Yes, several times.     Ja, over the years I have lost count and I saw nothing wrong or abhorrent in going to their house.  I saw them Chairperson as people in South Africa who enjoy the right that are in our constitution.       I had no reason to treat them like lepers.     And as people pretend that they be at the time when they met them for the first time.  It was a normal relationship that I had with people that I had approached and who had received us warmly to say let’s talk about establishing this institution.  They were foreigners that had come to South Africa but were prepared to buy into the vision of a bank that would belong to Africa.   They were prepared to buy into the vision of taking that bank and making it a bank of Africans.     Or like the African Bank has been the vision of Dr Muzinyane and a lot of our own South African business people did not buy into that vision.  I don’t want to go into names but I actually have spoken to a lot of people who thought that look they ...[intervenes]      Ja, I can’t say close, it depends on how you define close.     But there were people that I knew ...[intervenes]      That I interacted with, where I tried to do this thing and had not succeeded and the vision was kept alive.     Even when the Reserve Bank turned us down we said, I said to them that it does not mean that we must give up, and whenever there was information we would discuss it, for example Bank of Baroda at some point became our target.   It operates very successfully in Tanzania and in fact I have paid a lot of visits to Tanzania and I just made it my business to see some of the branches of Bank of Baroda in Tanzania.   There was another one that operates out of Togo, it is Eco Bank in Togo.  That one in fact Chairperson Nedbank they asked me if you became, if you bought this bank and you became CEO of the Bank what would you do?   I said you know what your problem is as Nedbank, and now I realise that I was naive because I gave them a very important strategic thing that I had thought about, and it was even before we did the deal.    I said the biggest bank in Africa with the widest reach is actually Eco Bank, it has more branches than any other bank in South Africa.  It started in Nigeria, most of its operations are in Nigeria, its headquarters is in Lome, I don’t know if you have ever been to Lome Chairperson, it is a very interesting place. You see this market in town where they sell African traditional things, what is it called, maimai[?], there’s a big one there where they sell all sorts of things, but anyway I went there and I saw it, the head office, I didn’t go inside, it is just from outside and it is a very impressive operation but the problem with it is that their operations have not modernised, so there may be the bank with their ...[indistinct] of branches, but they don’t have the – at the time the issue was there’s AGMS’s and now it will be ...[indistinct] ja, so they were not moving with the times. So I thought that if you are Nedbank and you buy Ecobank and you modernise it with a reach on the whole continent you have done something very big and the deal didn’t happen with Nedbank but Nedbank went and bought Ecobank but then they didn’t do what needed to be done.  They also did other things, Nedbank at the time only the country they were only in Lesotho and Namibia, and I thought what is your reluctance to go outside of South Africa.  Well of course we know the reason, the reason is because Nedbank actually is a Nederlandsche Bank, it came from the Netherlands and it was an Afrikaner Bank for a very long time and perhaps that is why they never left South Africa, but they bought Ecobank with the PIC after I had left, so we would meet with the Guptas and talk about this, and say look at what your friends are doing, Baroda, so-so and so on and so forth, ja, so we would discuss ...[intervenes]      ...issues, most of the time not relating to Transnet or Eskom actually.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     In 20?     2014, yes.     Mr Salim Essa?     What I said?     Yes Chairperson I was sitting at Rocco Mama’s ...[intervenes]     Rocco Mama’s, you know Rocco Mama’s Chairperson.     It’s happening there, it is not a shebeen but ... it is a restaurant it sells very nice hamburgers, and not far from my table there were two Indian ladies.      Hey?     Yes.     Yes, I think they are sisters, from the way that they looked, but I could overhear their conversation and one of them kept saying that Mr Zondo is going to be the next Chief Justice.  I just think it would be unfair to ask you to comment on that, it is exactly the same thing.     And that Mr Seleka will be the Deputy Chief Justice [laughing].      So you also don’t know?    So you also don’t know where they got it from?     No I don’t know Chairperson where that conversation came from, where it was going, I was not there, I don’t know Mr Salim Essa, I have never met him.     No, I actually Chairperson I don’t know where he got that from.     It is just like a lot of the rumours that go around and round and round.  In fact it is not something that I would normally apply my mind to and worry about and fret about and try to find out where it came from, because it is just a – it happens every day Chairperson that somebody has, somebody was told in the corridor or a house, a strange house that he doesn’t know that – about me, and he doesn’t even know who that person is.  I don’t attach a lot of weight to ...[intervenes]      No, no.     Yes.     Yes, yes I heard about it, I also heard the talk about it here.     I don’t know but did they say in the article where they got the information?     Did they say in the article where they got the information from?    Did the article say who it was written by?     No, I know about it, the point that I was trying to make is did the Commission therefore ask the person who wrote the article where did you get that information?     No I don’t know anything about it, I did hear about the article at the time, in fact I was out of the country and ja, and somebody just came to me and said hey have you seen what is on social media, and then I said I don’t know what this is all about and it was the end of the matter as far as I am concerned.     Chairperson in regard ...[intervenes]     As you can see Chairperson I am very eager to help your Commission.     I said as you can see I am very eager to help the Commission.     Chairperson as you remember in 2014/2015 the country suffered debilitating load shedding.   It was so bad Chairperson that one day I went to a bank and I wanted to go inside the bank at Irene Mall, which is a small mall and I found the bank manager, the Standard Bank bank manager, standing outside the bank and he said sorry the bank is closed.   I had never imagined that South Africa could come to that, that on a weekday, I think it was a Wednesday ...[intervenes]      Load shedding, it was in the middle of load shedding, the bank was closed, around ten/eleven in the morning on a week day, the bank manager was standing outside the bank and said the bank is closed and I was at Transnet, we were trying to ramp up the transportation of coal to Richards Bay because of the backlogs and so on and so forth, with electric locomotives. There was a time when we were running about 36 trains on the coal line to Richards Bay, scheduling them 36 trains in about 24 to 30 hours, that’s a lot of trains, electric trains and it takes time and planning to schedule trains like that and it takes weeks for us to add a train, add a train, add a train, until you arrive at the point where you are running about one train every 45 minutes to Richards Bay, and then there would be load shedding on part of the line and the whole systems collapses and it takes three to four weeks, maybe even more, six weeks to get the scheduling going on again. So it really frustrated me on all sorts of levels and then one day during a function at I think at the Port of ...[indistinct] Minister Brown said if we asked you to go to Transnet would you go ...[intervenes]      Minister Brown.     Lynne Brown yes, and I said yes, and she said okay and then a couple of days later, or maybe a week or so and she called back and said okay we are activating that.     We are activating it.     Yes and they said that’s fine, and then so I was aware that she was working on it, so she would have done the communications to the Board and so on.  We spoke, actually between me and her on this matter we spoke very few words.  She asked and I agreed, there was no long debate and so on and from my side it was like South Africa is really collapsing, the bank is closed at ten o’clock in the morning or at eleven o’clock in the morning and I saw the devastation on the rail line and I thought about what I was doing at Transnet was important, the implementation of the market demand strategy but I felt hey Eskom is more serious, if I can help there I should go there, and they activated it, she spoke to the Boards, one day I was on my way to Cape Town and I remember it was a Friday afternoon, no Thursday afternoon.  I had been invited to speak as a guest at a graduation ceremony of I think it was the Technikon, the Technikon in Cape Town, Western Cape Technikon, I don’t know what they call it now and I said – well she said where are you, I said I am at the airport, I am going to Cape Town.  She says don’t go, we are making the announcement tomorrow.  And I called Mr Caso Qiqwa[?] who was the CEO of Transport Port Terminals and I asked my PA to email him my speech at the graduation and asked him to go to Cape Town and deliver that speech, he was in Durban and then I stayed and she said tomorrow morning at ten o’clock you must be at Eskom, on Friday and then she made the announcement.     Probably a week or a week and a half, something like that.     A week and a half ja, since she raised it with me.     Yes, and she managed the process of communicating to the Boards, that the Boards had taken their proper decisions and this was done and I think in one – either one or both of them it was an ex poste approval which ...[indistinct] but the – and then there was a proper agreement that was signed and I went to Eskom.     Yes.     And Chairperson she was the shareholder of both companies, representative shareholder, 0% shareholding ...[indistinct] and they belong to the government, so if government said look you must move from here to there to help there at the time she said you will come back to Transnet, it’s just an appoint just to – there are certain things that I don’t understand at Eskom.  For example she says they are telling me that they cannot pay salaries in two months, Matsietsi Mohkolo repeated it yesterday that at that time they were not going to be able to pay salaries.      No I did not know Dr Ngubane before I got to Eskom, I know about him, in fact he was the ambassador to Japan and ...[intervenes]        Sorry.     Yes, yes, sorry Chairperson.   He was the ambassador to Japan and I think I am not sure if my memory ...[intervenes]      Ja, I can’t remember if he was still ambassador but we went there and we did a deal.     Ja, a Japanese Yen deal.    While he was, so we did a deal in the market for South Africa, South Africa issued a Yen bond and we went to Japan to sell the bond to Japanese investors.  I think I may have been with Ms Makato, she was the head of foreign funding, and while he was there, while we were there doing the deal as a delegation representing the South African government he hosted us.  I mean that was the first time that I had actually interacted with him closely and then for many years I never interacted with him until Eskom.     Dr Ngubane.     No, I don’t know his name ...[indistinct – laughing]     Yes.     I cannot comment on that meeting Chairperson, I do not know anything about it, I wasn’t there, in fact I was away ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Ja, but Chairperson I was referring to my consciousness for the first time I got to know it is when the Minister literally calls me aside during a function with many people and we speak in low tones, and she says would you go to Eskom.   It didn’t take three minutes and that was it so I don’t know what happened before and after.    I am tempted to comment.  Chairperson if you can observe events some of them imagined some of them real and you observe them either in your head or outside happening.  And then you decide that you would like to paint a picture.  You can paint any picture. These thoughts these mythical thoughts can be construed from anything.  Related events or unrelated events.  You can take things that happen – that happen in a particular way as a result of coincidence – that happen in – I am telling you that I do not know about these meetings.  I do not know Mr Salim Essa.    And yet you take all these events that were happening.  Well I can even ask – I mean on the day that Mr Bester and Mr Salim Essa had that meeting was it raining?  And was the fact that it was raining part of the dots?  Or was it a full moon?  Or anything can be connected to anything Chairperson.    People who come here and say they are connecting a dot and then as I am sitting here I can look at the sky and imagine a lion and actually connect the dots between the different stars – the stars at night.  You can see a lion if you look very carefully if you connect the dots. So Chairperson I – in law there was a – I do not know I had never studied law.  I know a lot of people who did but I did not.  But there is a theory of causation.   What – if somebody wakes up in the morning and starts by going to the bathroom and comes back and sleeps in the kitchen what was the cause of that?  Is it the fact that they woke up and went to the bathroom but because they – so you can connect the dots to anything and in fact this – this is a matter actually in law that is dealt with quite extensively about the theory of causation.   You cannot go and find all sundry events and try to connect them and find causation.    I think they call it the theory of causation.  Approximate causation not all the events that were happening in a restaurant in Melrose Arch for a discussion that people had on a rainy Sunday evening and say that it is – you know I even think that day maybe somebody got to a traffic light and caused an accident.    You could say that it was because of that discussion.    Yes I was not in those meetings.    Let us leave it there Chairperson.     I think we can ignore the fact that I tried to venture into the law.    I think therefore Chair my comment to be fair Mr Seleka.    Is to say that I note that you are talking about events that happened; that I was not aware of most of them.  They may or may not be for me a picture.  I cannot – have not definitively said and I do not think anyone can say that there is a picture that you draw from events that are carefully selected to paint the picture.    Yes.    Yes.    So he does not know who said it?    Chairperson the evidence of Mr Jonas he says he was at that house I think I remember that he said somebody was in the passage – he met in the passage.  He does not know who that person is.  Even as you are describing now he thought it was so and so but then maybe it could have been so and so as well.  And that person who he does not know said we are taking care of Mr Brian Molefe’s career. Now the weight of that evidence is very – is light it cannot be heavy – it cannot have a lot of – even though this is an inquiry and this inquiry can accept hearsay because that is what it is it is hearsay. Even though it is an inquiry that can accept hearsay but the quality of that hearsay is actually very bad.  Because he does not know who he heard it from in the first place.  And he says that he – I think he even said that that person was not part of the meeting.    Now the person who said that – who talked about me was not part of the meeting.    He said the person who talked about me was not part of the meeting.    Oh I thought he said it was somebody who was passing on the passage.    Okay but I – I cannot comment on it.  I deny that there is any Gupta person was responsible for my career.  I was responsible for my career and – and that especially because that hearsay evidence is not even corroborated by anyone.  Nobody else overheard what they were saying or came here to say that we are taking care of Mr Molefe’s career. I do not know whether it happened or that Mr Jonas is remembering it wrong or it is just a figment of his imagination or that he cannot distinguish it from something that he dreamt to something that really happened. I do not know but I can tell you now as under oath as evidence that there was no Gupta brother that took care of my career.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja but Chairperson I feel it is a bit unfair that people come here and say that we were gossiping about Mr Molefe in his absence.  And that I was at the house.  I do not know about the – the fact Mr Jonas is making whether it took place R600 billion and so on.  I am not commenting about that. The fact that they talked about me at the meeting that I was not there and I am not aware of.  And it may have been Mr Mkize and a discussion at Luthuli House about me it was gossiping.  Because I was not there.      So they were – they were talking about me.    And I was not there.    Well I do not know what is the definition of gossip but …    But that is what gossip is.  I do not know but …    But let us not use the gossip then but they were talking about me and I was not there and I was not aware of their discussion. I do not know how that should reflect on me.    Or how I should take accountability.    For those discussions that took place in my absence.    Or how I should then now in a commission of the inquiry explain myself about discussion that took place in my absence about me.    Ja I know nothing about it Chairperson and I will not comment on it.     No, I do understand Chair.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV MASUKU SC:   Sorry, Chairperson.  That copy that you have, have got some minor edits on it but there are...  ja, that is just typing errors and so on because we – I finished it literally ...[intervenes]      Oh, no I do not have it with me.     I literally did not...     ...to come here.  So ...[intervenes]      But it can be made available.     Yes.     That has been properly edited.     Because over the last three days, it really had been a nightmare.     Yes, Chair.     H’m.     Deputy Chief Justice, they are sabotaging me to come and stand behind the podium ...[intervenes]      [Indistinct]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     I do not understand ...[intervenes]      Yes, I was ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Deputy Chief Justice, I am in agreement with my learned friend’s view.  The allegations made in the statement are not light allegations.  That State Capture is what you find in the statement of Mr Molefe.  I rather would add, is that, perhaps what should be send to the – to those implicated in the statement is not just the written statement that has been handed up to you but that the transcript of what he ...[intervenes]      said ...[intervenes]      ...be part of his statement.      Because at some point, I think he was elaborating on certain things, he would move away from the statement and elaborate on certain things.     So if that could be done.     That will be...     The statement is not lightly made.  It is a very serious statement.     So I do accept that it is one that should be – certainly ...[intervenes]      Ja, yes.  But just to take advantage of the fact that I am here.  I made an error when I said that I was instructed by the Molefe attorneys.     It is Molaba Attorneys.      But our instructing attorney is Mr Molefe.     So it was just ...[intervenes]      Yes, no, right here... [laughs]       [laughs]       Yes.     I think he will answer that for you.     So what we have canvassed that is with him.     And he has no difficulties turning it into an affidavit.       If it should be required by the Commission to do so.     As he says, some of the things he made – some of the allegations he made, already in his ...[intervenes]      ...in his affidavit.  So there will not be any deviation from his central mission.     Which is to tell the Commission about what real State Capture looks like.  [laughs]       Thank you, Chair.     It is the right time Chair.  We have gone beyond the tea-time.     Okay that is in order.     [No audible reply]      Not that one.  I must just accept that...  I mean, the – we have to follow the Covid protocol once you were exposed to someone with Covid.  And one – you are quite correct that you now need to go and isolate.  But it is not just you who must isolate.  It is your staff.     It is everybody that is.       Carry your bags.     Carry your books.     And everybody else.     And it seems to me that we should not really be in a rush to some hearing tomorrow ...[intervenes]      ...or next week without knowing exactly what your state of...     What the state of the situation looks like.     I would propose that maybe in about five days when the fog clears ...[intervenes]      ...and you still feel okay ...[intervenes]      ...then you can write to everybody and say we can reconvene.     And we will make sure that Mr Molefe is available to do that.     We prefer being physically present.     And of course, this place has to be fumigated as well because ...[intervenes]      Ja.     So it is quite an inconvenience ...[intervenes]      ...to be exposed to this kind of thing.     But it is quite vigorous.     So I would suggest that we do not ...[intervenes]      Ja.     And in respect of the other matter you mentioned, the letter, the love letter you received.     Perhaps that also resolves some of the difficulties we would have faced.     [laughs]  I just thought I would mention that one.     Yes.  [laughs]       No, that is just.     H’m.     Ja.     We can say, it is divine providence.     There is a ...[indistinct] [laughs] 
MOLEFE: Sorry Eskom, Eskom, eish, sorry Chairperson, my life is a ... if we asked you to go to Eskom would you go.    He had been a cabinet minister ...[intervenes]
