CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody.    Yes are we ready?    Yes thank you.    Good morning.    Just raise your voice    Yes.    Yes.    Well before that I have got an – I have got – is this a duplication or what?  Oh ja I have got two files that appear to be the same on the outside.  Let me see.    Oh.    Oh.   It is just that I have got what I thought would have been a reference being the same SEQ02.2020 for both of them.  But the one you are moving is I think this other one the identity of – oh well the person has deposed to the founding affidavit there has got a name.    Then there is this one which has got an affidavit with the name and certain particulars blocked out.    Yes.    Now – so the application is being brought by the State Security Agency?    Is that correct?    Well you see – it is tricky because the application is being brought by the State Security Agency and not by the person himself or herself.  But the founding affidavit is by the person himself.  In the founding affidavit it does not say that the Applicant is the State    No I am not there yet.  I am not on the merits of the application.  I am on the Applicant.  I am saying that I need to know who the Applicant is first.  Now the – the one that I dealt with two days ago – two days ago the Applicant was Mr X.  So Mr X brought the application.  Now here the heading suggests that the applicant is the State Security Agency.  Now you cannot just decide that because you are employed by the State Security Agency you are going to bringproceedings in the name of the State Security Agency.  You know.  There has got to be more than that.  Are you authorised to bring the application on behalf of the State Security Agency?    Well what he says there in 1.3 is also – reads very strangely.  I have the necessary locus standi and authority to depose to this affidavit and to launch the present application.  Now it does not do what is normally done.  I bring this application on behalf of the State Security Agency and I am duly authorised by reason of bla, bla, bla, bla, bla.  So when you read part of 1.3 it is like he is bringing it himself because otherwise if the application is being brought by the State Security Agency his – he does not have to talk about his locus standi.  No he talks about his locus standi if he is bringing it himself.      Yes unfortunately I cannot talk about – we cannot talk about what his position is in the agency because that would reveal …    His identity.  So that also makes it tricky becausewithout knowing that it could be some administrative officer or somebody not so high up in the agency who then decides I am bringing the application or rather I am – the – my employer is going to be the applicant.  Whereas it is the employer who must decide whether they are going to be the – the applicant in these proceedings and he says he has the authority.  I do not think he says he attaches anything.    You know very often people say I am authorised.  Sometimes you suspect they do not even know what that means.  So I am not suggesting he does not know but I am just saying his is one of those averments that people just put in so easily in affidavits.  I am authorised to do this and that and that, you know.  So I am – I am just raising these as concerns at this stage.  I am not saying that they are necessarily standing in the way but I am concerned about them, you know.  I do not know whether the plan is for him to give evidenceimmediately after we have dealt with the application or he could come later.  Because it may be that you might need to just rectify some things in the application.  Is the – is the plan that he would be the next witness?    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.     Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.  Okay.    Okay.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  Thank you.  Well you see you might have to choose whether you stick to bringing the application – you stick to the State Security Agency being the applicant or whetheryou decide to change and make the witness the applicant.    If you – if you decide to change then you could have Mr Y as the applicant in the heading.    Mr Y.    And then he brings the application as Mr Y.ADV DAVID MTSWENI   And he indicates – might – indicates that Y is not hisreal name but it is for purposes of these proceedings.  It is important that his identity be not disclosed.    And he asks for leave that he be referred to in these proceedings as Mr Y.    Yes.  Ja no that is fine.  We will stand the application down so that you can attend to that and then at a later stage then I can deal with the application.    Okay.  So this application will stand down.  Okay.    We do not need to do any – to adjourn ne?    We do not – ja.  Okay.     Yes okay.    Okay.      Yes thank you.  You can administer the oath or affirmation.     Thank you.  You may be seated.  Yes Ms Hofmeyr.   Ms Nokunqoba Gloria Dlamini’s affidavit and annexures to that affidavit will be admitted as Exhibit DD24 and will be marked accordingly.    Yes.    Thank you.    Yes I think your voice is quite soft so…    So do make an effort to raise it.    Okay.    Hm.    What page?    17 okay.    Okay.  Are you familiar with the Provisions of this Act?    You are?  Okay.    Okay.    Just repeat the question.    Okay.  Okay.    Ms Dlamini.  Just listen to the question carefully …    And answer just the question.  The question is doesSection 1 of this Act say what Mr Mahlobo quoted here.  Do you know?  I know that …    Section 1 used to be the definition section …    Of an Act.    So - but some of the definitions now are at the end of the Act.  So do - do - are you able to say whether he has got it right?   He did not get it right?    Okay.  Alright.    Well it would be interesting to know whether there is any section in the Act that says that.    There is not?    Oh.  That would be very interesting.    Okay.    But it does not say what he has quoted here?    Okay.    Well somebody must just go and check …    Whether it is among the files.   Tell her what is …    What - what is written on the spine.    On the spine.    On - on the spine outside.  On the spine.  Does it say legislation on - on the …   On the opposite side?    No, no.  At the back.  Ja.    Oh.  Okay.    Oh.  Okay.    Ja.  Do not nod.  You …    You must give the answer …    So that it can be captured.    Ja.    Well I - I see Ms Hofmeyr that Section 1 is the definition section.    Let me see if I can assist.  Ms Dlamini …    There is a difference between something that must be done.  You say that thing is compulsory and a situation wheresomething does not have to be done, but maybe done.  You understand?    It is compulsory that when you come to the Commission you be dressed …    But it is not compulsory that you put on your best dress.  Okay, but if you like you can put on your best dress.  Okay.  So now was your understanding that if somebody is employed by a - an organ of State security vetting is compulsory …    Or was your understanding that if you are employed by an organ of State.  It may be necessary under certain circumstances that you be subjected to security vetting, but it is not compulsory.  Which of the two are you saying was …   Your understanding?    It is compulsory?    And does that mean all the millions that are employed by Government must all be vetted and they would all have been vetted?    Irrespective of your position?  The cleaning staff invarious Government Departments.They also have on your understanding they must be subjected to security vetting.    Is that right?    That has always been your understanding?    Okay.  Alright.    I wanted to say Ms Hofmeyr maybe they purport to …    Quote it.     Rendering a service if they are going to have access to classified information.     And it seems that if Executives are going to have access to executive – to classified information definitely Board Members would also have access.    So even if you don’t say Board Members are employees but they are people who are rendering a service and will have access to classified information if the Executive Managers also have access.     Yes.     So irrespective of what the other instrument is that you referred to on the basis of your understanding of the Act, Section2A.     They should have been vetted if their responsibilities required them to have access to classified information.     Ja, okay.  Has that helped?     No, no I am sorry, what would you have to think asyou sit there today?     Yes, no I thought she asked you the question whether as you sit there now you would think the Board members should also have been vetted, and I thought you had given an answer which was yes.     As you sit here, but at that time you didn’t thinkabout it.     Okay but the answer you gave her was not the same, Ms Hofmeyr did I misunderstand something?     Maybe just for the sake of completeness and I think we have both touched on this, would you know or would you not knowwhether Executive Managers of SAA would have access to classified information?   Is that something you would know or is that something you would not know?     Yes, but are you able to say well if executive managers of SAA were going to have access to classified information then the Board would also have access to classified information, is that something you are able to say in terms of your ...[intervenes]      Yes, it’s logical.     Yes, okay.     Yes, yes.     Yes, no that is fine, we will adjourn for tea andresume at half past.  We adjourn.     Okay, let us continue.     Did you say page 20?     Okay.     Well what Miss Hofmeyr is putting to you or is asking you Miss Dlamini is actually fundamental to this project that you werevetting.  This sentence says the objective of this project, of this vetting is to ensure that classified and sensitive documents within SAA are accessed by personnel with valid security clearances.  Now she is saying to you the starting point, should the starting point not have been the people that you are required to vet, do they have access to classified and sensitive information or documents in terms of their jobs because if you do not ask that question first before doing the project, you may be wasting everybody’s time and money, vetting people who will not have access to classified information and sensitive documents.  You understand the question?     But that is not the question.  The question relates to the objective of this project.  The objective of this project was not to make sure everybody employed at SAA was security vetted, that was, that is not the objective that is stated here.  What is stated here is that the reason why you were having this project was to make sure that people who had access to sensitive information would be people who have valid security clearances, and the question is how do you undertake a project which has such an objective if you do not know that the people that you are going to spend time on vetting, are people who do have access tosuch information.     You want to take it from there Miss Hofmeyr?     Yes, you see Miss Dlamini, if the objective of the project was to vet everybody at SAA who was employed there, then it would be open to you to say well we did not have to check whether people, the people we were vetting had access to classified information because we were simply vetting everybody who was employed there,okay?  But that is not what the objective says as I understand it.  It seems to say we vetting people so that when they have access to classified information, sensitive information they would be having valid security clearances and the whole question that Miss Hofmeyr was asking and I was coming in on, is one would have expected that if that is the, that was the objective one would expect that you would seek first to establish who has in the course of their responsibilities, in the course of their duties, who has access to classified information and sensitive information, sensitive documents, give us those people, those are the ones we are going to - to deal with.    No, no no, Miss Dlamini I do not want us to waste time on this.  We have dealt with that and you have agreed that is not the basis on which the, this project was done.  The basis on which this project was done is stated in the objective [intervenes].     And that does not talk about everybody that is employed it talks about somebody who may have access to classified and sensitive documents.  You might be able to answer, you might not be able to answer but one would have expected that if that was the objective you would say to SAA or whoever we do not want to waste time vetting people who’s jobs do not require them them to have access to sensitiveinformation.  We do not want to waste time vetting people who really have nothing to do, who do not come close to sensitive or classified information.  Give us the ones ‘whose responsibilities put them in a position where they could have access.     Where does it say that in the letter?  Or which letter is it?  The first one that was by Minister Mahlobo?     Yes.     Well let us start with 17.  On paragraph 2 I just see where it says given sensitive information received on an ongoing basis.  Now I do not know whether you know, I do not know who is supposed to receive that sensitive information that he is talking about, whether he is talking about the State Security Agency receiving sensitive information about SAA?  Or whether he is talking about anybody else?       Do you know?  I do not know.    Okay, alright.     Is there anything else in that letter that you think supports your not checking whether they had access to?     Let us start on the letter dated or on, appearing onpage 17, is there anything that you rely on there to say these Ministers said these executives have access to sensitive information?     Ya.     Yes, you see it is not going to help if we are going to look at these letters if you do not know if the letters help you answer the question.  If you – if you know that they contain something that helps you answer the question then it is fine but if you do not know then there is nopoint in looking at them     Do you know whether if they provide an answer for you?     Ya, but that is speculation, is that right, you are speculating?     But – but other than speculation you are not able to point to anything to say it shows that it supports the decision to vet people without checking whether they have access, they had access to sensitive information, is that right?     Yes but remember paragraph 2 you agreed with me earlier on that where it refers to sensitive information we do not know who they are talking about, the Ministers is talking about, whether he is talking about sensitive information received by State Security Agency about SAA?     Or whether it is, we do not know who received the information that he is talking about, okay?     Alright. If you feel that you have not, if you want to check something before we leave this point you may have a look.     But otherwise if there is nothing else Miss Hofmeyr can move on.     Yes?     Sorry?     But he, all he is doing is just referring to what Minister Mahlobo said in his letter.     He is not saying anything of his own.     Miss Hofmeyr?    Before you do that Ms Hofmeyr.    Ms Dlamini it looks like that date on page 38 the first date 8 December 2016 is wrong.  Should it not be 2015?    Mm?    But then you are talking about- how can you start with 8 December 2016 and come to 11 January 2016?    No, the first- well, either the first date are wrong or theother dates are wrong.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Depending on what the answer is.    The answer is yes?    No, the question is, did you not subject staff who were not executive managers to a polygraph test?    You did not?    Did you sub- was it only the executive managers that you subjected to a polygraph test?   Okay.    Do you understand the question?    I think you do.  Okay she will repeat it.    Ja nobody ever said that.      I thought we – you said you considered that.      Yes we dealt with that.    You were not able to point out anything that says that.    Remember I gave you time to say where does it saythere that the executives would receive sensitive information.    No.      Ms Dlamini you can accept that it does not say that and we looked at it, both – I gave you chance to look and we – I asked you and you conceded.  Let us move on.    By the acting CEO?    Or by – you gave it to the acting CEO?    You did not send the information to the individual executive managers?    Okay so whether or not he passed it on you do not know?    Oh would he – would he be meant to pass it on?    And do you know whether the correspondence that was addressed to him with that – with the outcome asked him to convey the outcome to the managers or not?    It did ask him?   Okay.    Were you the one who – who asked Mr Zwaneverbally to inform the other executive managers of the outcome?    Did he undertake to do so?    Okay.    But you – you understand that term to include support staff, did you not?    Maybe let us put the question like this.  Do you conduct polygraph tests as part of your duties or have you done that in the past?    You do not?    Do you know whether there is – there are standard questions that are asked at – at a polygraph test?    Ja.   Yes.    Do – do you have an idea how many the standard questions are more or less?  10, 20, 50, 200?    Sorry?    About 7/8?   7 or 8?    Those would be the standard questions.    But the person conducting the test could ask additional questions?    Would you know whether in terms of asking additional questions those conducting the tests normally ask not more than a certain number of additional questions or is that something you would not know?    You would not know.    On its own?    Yes but the standard questions about 7 or 8?    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay alright.    Ja standard ones.    ja.    But the person conducting the test is allowed…    And – but you do not know whether there is a limit as to how many?    Ja okay.    Oh ja.    Ja.    Ja it …    Ja if you say you would not be able to …    Get the answer within an hour – within the lunch break that is fine.    She does not know what – what you have access to and what you do not have access to.    Yes.  But you can provide it later?    Is it the kind of information you might be able to provide tomorrow?    In one way or another?    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja if they are ready I can deal with it now?    Well was there not going to be one that would refer to him as Mr Y?    Yes.    Ja let me …    Hear what he has to say.  Ms Dlamini you may leave the witness stand for now.  You will come back after lunch.    Yes for now.  Okay.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Mr Y’s.    Oh no what I meant was I did not want an application without any name but I did not mean that you have got to put in theapplication his real name.  I – when I said Mr Y I meant that in the heading it could say Mr Y – Applicant.  And then in the affidavit what I was saying he could say, I, the undersigned Mr Y bla, bla, bla and then immediately explain that Mr Y is not my true name.    But for purposes of these proceedings I ask for leave that I be referred to as Mr Y bla, bla, bla.  That is the kind of thing I was talking about.    Yes.  Ja.   Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Well what – what I can do – but the information in the affidavit that you have just handed up is it the same as the information in the affidavit that you handed up in the morning?    Yes.  Yes.    Now you would know that I dealt with an application which might be along the same lines two days ago.  The order that you had put up in the morning seemed to be wider than the order that I granted two days ago.  But I understand that you have been given a copy of the order that I made two days ago.    And has the draft order that you have put up now ..    Is it – is it exactly the same as the other one or not?    Yes.    Yes.  So you – you essentially seek the same kind of order?    Yes.   Okay.    Okay.  Just to be – maybe I think – I think maybe I – if the affidavit that you have put up is essentially the same as the one that you had given me in the morning – if they are the same I am quite happy not to use the one that has got his name and use the one that does not have his name on the basis that it will be amended appropriately after I have – I have dealt with the application.    That can be done?    Yes.    Take this back then to – to him.  So basically you willensure that the application – the applicant is Mr Y is reflected as Mr Y.    But certainly now the application can be taken to be brought by Mr Y.    Okay alright.    Yes.  Yes.   Let me see – what the basis simply that – was the basis for this kind of order arising from Mr Y’s employment?    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.      Yes.      Yes, no, no I remember.  I think that the – the issue of Notice is it dealt with in the affidavit notice to implicated persons?  How is it dealt with?   Yes.  Hm.   Okay alright.  Let me just check who will address the issue of notice with me?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Handed up.  Yes.    Yes.    My – the two I have on this draft order reads   That is number 2.    Oh.      That is the one that was just handed up now.    It is written Mr Y.    As applicant.    Oh.    Yes.    Yes.  Is there not another copy from the…    Ja.    Oh okay.    Oh.    Ja.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So other than that part…    They are the same.    Okay alright.    Yes.    Okay alright.   Okay.  Okay no that is fine.    Then unless counsel for Mr Y has anything else I am quite happy to make an – make the order here?    Yes.    Okay.  In respect of the application brought by Mr Y Igrant the following order. 1. The witness is to be referred to during his evidence to the commission and after his evidence insofar as the commission is concerned as Mr Y. 2. The witness’ name, his position within the State Security Agency and the nature of his duties shall not be disclosed or published in any manner. 3. No person may take or publish any photograph, image or appearance of the witness nor have his photograph or image or appearance published in any way nor broadcast any video of the witness. 4. The witness need not present – need not be present at the commission’s hearing venue when giving evidence – his evidence and may give his evidence from a secret location. 5. No person other than the Chairperson, members of thecommission’s legal team, the commission’s safety and security advisor, those necessary to assist the witness when he gives evidence or another person specifically designated by the Chairperson will be permitted to enter the secret location without the prior written permission of the Chairperson. 6. An audio link from the secret location will be provided so that the witness’ evidence can be heard in the hearing room when he gives it. 7. This order may be amended or supplemented by the Chairperson at any time if in his opinion that is necessary to ensure the non-disclosure of the witness’ name and appearance or to ensure fairness to any implicated person. That is the order.    Okay.  So you will make the necessary amendments on page 1 in terms of the – of who the applicant is?    Okay alright.    Thank you.  We are going to adjourn.  I am tempted to say maybe we should resume at quarter past two.    Because of…    Logistics.   Yes.  We will adjourn now and we are going to resume at quarter past two.    We adjourn.    Are you ready?    Yes.    I am sorry.  Would it be correct to say presented by was meant to be prepared by?    Okay.    Well before you move away from that issue Ms Hofmeyr.  I - I do not understand Ms Dlamini what the relevance is of that sentence in the context of your report.  There were no strikes or serious disturbances reported.  You say since the project started.  So you are looking at during the time - during the life of the    You are now at the end. You are preparing your report.    Please help me understand why strikes and disturbances would be relevant to put in …    This kind of report?    You see if your - if you had said something along the lines that you are not aware of anybody who was unhappy about the project.  That - that I would understand.  Your - your reference to what happened in Parliament I would understand it, but in Parliament you are not saying there were strikes and disturbances or at least you are notsaying there were strikes.  It seems that some unhappiness was there …    But strikes.    Hm.  Okay.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  Well I do not know about strikes.    I think let us move on.    No Ms Dlamini please.  No.  No.  Please.  Please.  Are you going to persist in saying that because of this vetting process suddenly SAA got it a R2 billion …    Turnover?    Hm.    But is that what you are going to say?    That as a result of …    This project?   What positive shift?    What happened as a result of this project?    Revenue generation?    That is your thinking?    Okay Ms Hofmeyr.    Findings of the project?    Do you know where it is Ms Hofmeyr?    Yes.    Yes.   Is there an index?    To - to - yes.    Well if - if the content page does not have findings as an item.  I do not think you will find findings - any heading saying “Findings” in the report, because findings would have been quite important …    And they would have been included in the content I would imagine.    Yes.    Yes.   Hm.    Just going back to the - to page 61. “The great success of the SAA Vetting Project hasresulted to the project being extended to other entities within SAA.” Are you saying that you are not able to tell us what the great success was of the project?  You want to go and have a look at it - at some document?    Ja.  No.  Leave out the findings …    And recommendations.  Here you say the great success of the SAA Vetting Project has resulted blah, blah, blah.  So the question that Ms Hofmeyr asked earlier on was what is that success that you are talking about here and I understood you to say you want to have a look at some document.  So I am wondering whether you were the leader of this project …    You cannot tell us this was the - the great success …    Of the project.    Okay.    Tell me the great success as you know it even if it isnot going to be exactly as documented somewhere.    This was a - this was a big project …    And an important project.  Is it not?    Ja.  You cannot remember what it is great success was if it had a great success.    So that is the …    Great success?    Okay.    Okay.    Thank you.   No Ms Dlamini.  What Ms Hofmeyr has put to you is she is questioning the need for this project of vetting to have happened and particularly maybe at the size at which it happened.  So she is drawing your attention to say here is another way in which you couldhave achieved what you call a great success without this vetting project that subjected people to a very invasive process. That is what she is saying.  She is questioning the need for the vetting project to have been embarked upon …    And she is inviting you to say whether you agree that you did not need to do the vetting exercise in order to establish whether the contracts …    Of employment of the Executives had a clause sayingthey should undertake that.  You obviously did not need the - the vetting process to establish what is in the contract.    No.  Why refer to that?  We are not talking about that.    Cast your mind back to before the project started.  If you want to - if one of the things you wanted to check is whether the Executives contracts of employment had a certain clause.  You did not need the betting process for that - to establish that.  You needed to check with management or say let me see the contracts.    Do you - do you agree?    And then you would - if you were given the contractsyou would know whether they have got …    The clauses that you are looking for.    Okay.    No.  No.  That is fine.    She is taking the three points which you - you gaveus great success one by one.    That is what she is doing.    Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr.    Yes.  She - she has told you that is what she - she is challenging.    Yes, but she is giving you a chance to - to say why …    You do not agree.     So I guess Ms Dlamini going back to the discussion we had earlier on that all the millions of State employees we have inSouth Africa are supposed to be security vetted, if they have all been vetted and despite that we have the high levels of corruption that we are having then this security vetting doesn’t help reduce corruption.     Mmm?     Why not?     (laughing)  Ms Hofmeyr”?     Would your advice have included whether they should dismiss people who didn’t receive security clearance?     So the short answer is you would not advise an entity to dismiss people who fail to get a security clearance?     And somebody thinks that it would not be a goodground to dismiss somebody who is not able to get security clearance in an entity that emphasizes on fighting corruption?     So if you did security vetting in an entity and you did subject 100 people to the security vetting and 50 of them did not get clearance you would still not be able to advise the entity to get rid of the 50?     Ja, so they would stay with the problem that half of its staff have failed to get security clearance?     But did I misunderstand your evidence when I thought it was to the effect that you need to have your staff security cleared in order to reduce corruption or potential for corruption, did Iunderstand your evidence correctly?     Yes, but you agree that in the example I am giving then the entity would remain with quite a serious risk as far as State Security Agency is concerned?     Ms Hofmeyr?     Not you can Ms Hofmeyr, you must.    She is asking whether she understood your evidence earlier correctly?     Well Ms Hofmeyr I don’t know whether I’m hearing things that you are not saying, but I think it is the second time I hear you as if you say Ms Myeni.    Did anybody hear something like that.   No?     Okay, no a lot of people say – a lot of people say you didn’t say that, so maybe it is just me.  Ms Dlamini you didn’t hear anything like that?     You think?     Well I can tell you this side too you have supporters.   Okay, alright, maybe I just ...[intervenes]      No, it is just the past two days we heard a lot of Ms Myeni and Mr Myeni.     Ja.    Well that might require to be a lawyer.     Ja.     Okay, let me ask you this question, if you accept that the purpose of conducting a vetting investigation in terms of Section 2A is to determine the security competence of a person, if you accept that that’s the purpose.     And you accept that the security competence of aperson relates to the ability of that person to cause confidential information to land in unauthorised hands.   If you accept that isn’t the position therefore this, that there are a lot of people that can be excluded from the need for a vetting investigation because by virtue of the type of job they do, they are far away from being able to access confidential information.     Because if they can’t access it they can’t cause it to land in unauthorised hands, do you accept that?     Okay.     Okay.     Yes.     It’s classified.     ...[Indistinct]      Maybe another way of asking it would be this without requiring you to have legal knowledge.     If we accept, and I understand you to accept, that the purpose of security vetting is to determine the security competence would you not agree that therefore security vetting where the person orpersons who are being vetted don’t have access to classified information doesn’t serve the purpose that is – that security vetting is supposed to achieve?     Yes, why do you not agree?     No, no, no you must listen to my question carefully.     Let’s go back and you must tell me if I misunderstood you.       Earlier on I thought you agreed with me that if you look at Section 2A the purpose of conducting a vetting investigation is to determine the security competence of a person.  I understood youcorrectly, you agree with that part?     Yes okay.  Then Ms Hofmeyr took you to the definition of security competence, you remember?     And I think we are all agreed that what it – what the Act says it is, is that it refers to the ability of a person or access to classified information by a person and the ability to allow classified information to land on unauthorised hands, are we agreed or we are not agreed?   Let’s go to 8, what was the Section Ms Hofmeyr?    Okay, let’s go to 363, I just want to, if you say you don’t agree I want to make sure I understand why you don’t agree, okay?     Security competence means a person’s ability to act in such a manner that he or she does not cause classified information or material to fall into unauthorised hands, thereby harming or endangering the security of interest of the State.  Okay, it is the ability of a person to act in a manner that he or she does not cause classified information or material to fall into unauthorised hands.  So that person, as I read this, must be somebody who has access to classified information or who can have access to classified information by virtue of the duties or responsibilities or work that he or she is doing, are we agreed on that or are we not?    Well let me first put this, so we agree on that.     Now as I understand the position, and you should know better, classified information is not information you are going to get all over, classified information is stored and kept somewhere, am I right?        Not all the time?    But when it is not where it is supposed to be is it not because somebody has done something, has allowed it to land in unauthorised hands?     But most of the time would it not, in an organisation isn’t the position that only very few people would have access to classified information?     I am simply saying, and I don’t know, I am saying you might know better, I am under the impression that when information is classified, when a document is classified where it is kept is something quite important, you don’t want it lie around.  That is myunderstanding, and only a few people in an organisation would have access to classified information.I may be wrong but that’s the picture that I have, because you don’t want, you want only a few people to know about that information, authorised people.  Isn’t it?     Well I thought that to have a document classifiedmeans somebody makes a decision ...[intervenes]      That it is classified.     It doesn’t generally speaking become classified on its own.  Somebody needs to have – to know what it contains and should take a view that this is something that should be classified, so if that is correct I would imagine that in any organisation there must be very few people who have access to classified information, because that’s information you don’t want everyone to know.     Yes, yes.      Ja, but you are there, so you know this is classified and you don’t want the person to see it.     And you are not going to leave classified information unattended, if there are people who can come in.     Well I would think that those people who are responsible for classified information takes steps and measures tomake sure only people who have the relevant clearance or who are authorised can see the information on the documents, not anybody can see it, but are you saying you are not sure whether it is like that?     But is it supposed to be the case?     Ja, you see that’s important because if that is how it is supposed to be but maybe there are breaches of security.     That is now another issue because that might be because of other things, but if you accept that the information once classified is supposed to be kept somewhere and only a few people have access to it in an organisation that has got more than 1 000 employees I wouldn’t see why you would need to vet 500 employeeswho have no chance of having access to this information, do you understand what I mean.     But those who may be close because of their positions then I would understand.     Okay, Ms Hofmeyr?     I am sorry Ms Hofmeyr, I needed to take a break at three, I know I would have liked us to finish with Ms Dlamini before we – I take the break but I think I must take it because we are at quarter past.     Let’s take a ten minutes break, I just have some urgent document that I must sign.     We are going to take a ten minutes break.  We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.    I do not think we can go beyond 17H00 but we can go beyond 16H00, maybe to 16H30 maybe up to 16H45, or even 17H00.  How is the situation for tomorrow looking?     Ja, oh okay, okay.     Ja okay.     Ya.     No, no, no do not worry about this sense you are getting.  Do not worry about the sense you are getting, just answer the question.  Let me, I believe you have answered the question previously but I am going to put again and see whether you are deviating from that answer.  Okay.  The purpose of conducting a vetting investigation in terms of Section 2(A) is to determine the security competence of a person, you agree?     Ja.  Now, when you go to, or let me put it this way, if you conduct a vetting investigation, a security vetting process, which does not determine the security competence of that person, then you are not conducting a vetting process that can achieve the purposes stated in the Act, is that correct?    Yes.     Well, I do not have to agree with you now, but you are answering a question that you want to answer, you are not answering the question that I am putting to you.     Okay let us go again.      The purpose of a vetting, security vetting exercise in terms of Section 2(A) is to determine the security competence of a person.     Okay, do you agree with me that if you conduct a vetting, security vetting process which cannot or is not going to determine the security competence of that person, then you are conducting a security vetting process that will not achieve the purpose stated in the law?     Well, well you are right.  If you are not going todetermine, if you are not using a vetting process for the purpose stated in the law, then you should not conduct it at all.  You agree?      Okay, Miss Hofmeyr do you want to take it from here?     I guess the short answer is yes, can only be yes.     Well you just need to answer the question Miss Dlamini we do not need any other thing.     No, no, no Miss Dlamini, Miss Hofmeyr has not asked you about any of those things.  It is a simple question and I thought you – you had previously given an answer maybe indirectly, you said earlier on, you will not advise an entity to dismiss people who failed security vetting, did I understand you correctly?     Yes, and you said, you know, I think you saidsomething along the lines that you know there are labour laws.     Which gave me the impression that you were saying as far as you are concerned somebody should not be dismissed because they have failed security vetting, is my understanding of your evidence correct?     Ya, no, hang on.     What Miss Hofmeyr is now saying to you, is against that background, the background of that evidence that you gave, here is somebody who refused to take part or disclose information for vetting purposes and she was being charged with misconduct for – for that.  Do you regard the charging of somebody because they refuse to give information to the Security Agency for vetting purposes as acceptable or as improper?  That is what she is asking, and I think she is asking against the background that you had previously given advice that, you know, there are labour laws and you will not advice that somebody should be dismissed.  Are you able to say whether you would regard it as proper or improper, acceptable or unacceptable for somebody to be charged with misconduct for refusing to give information to State Security Agency for vetting purposes?     Okay.     Ya, that is fine.     Yes.     Ya, no I think that particularly the question of why was it used, will be very important.     Because the, it has been said that certain institutions, state institutions, may have been used or were used to advance State Capture and to advance corruption.  So – so it becomes important, I mean the loss of seven executives, it will be important also to see whether it is connected with the vetting, the objection to the vetting, but also whetherthe vetting process may have been used in order to push certain people out of SAA, so all of those things will need to be explored.     Miss Dlamini thank you very much for coming to give evidence we appreciate it.  If we need you we will ask you to come back again.     You hope not? Thank you very much Miss Dlamini and you are excused.     Thank you.     Yes, okay.     Good afternoon.  Do feel free to rise and leave Miss Dlamini.     Thank you.  Yes Mr Mbikiwa.  At long last.     Yes.     Well we are now going to deal, hear the evidence ofMr Y.     Yes.  You would like that his affidavit and annexures that to be admitted and they be marked Exhibit DD(23)?     It is so ordered.     For the record I just want to state, Mr Y has taken theprescribed oath as he has been sworn in, do you confirm that Mr Y?     Thank you.     One - one second.     I know Mr Y that of all of us, that you would be the one person who would be very careful not to say anything that might indirectly reveal your identity.     But I do just want to mention that if you mention your responsibilities, your duties, it may well be, that that could reveal your identity, so as you give evidence just keep an eye on that.     Alright.    Okay.     Okay.     Yes.    Mr Mbikiwa will ask you questions but you have just made a reference to the former President.  We have quite a few former Presidents in the country who are still alive, which one are you talking about?    Okay alright.  Mr Mbikiwa.    One second.  Thank you.  Yes.    Okay.  Let us adjourn then for 5 minutes.  We adjourn.    I take it the problem has been solved.    Technical problem.      Yes.  Mr Y, are you still there?   Thank you.  Let us proceed.    Yes, I- before we had the break, I thought I would ask Mr Y.  Mr Y, at some stage you were giving evidence about the numbers of the people in this unit.  And you were mentioning a much lower number than the number that I see at 4.3.  Is there any significance to the discrepancy?    In 4.3 you say ... (intervenes)    Ja you say you understand that it was about 200 agents.    But I think earlier you talked about 20 or something like that.    Oh, so it is two different categories.    Oh, for the 200?    Oh okay.  Has he covered that part?  Or you plan to deal with it later    Yes.    Yes.  And the question of where they seem to have been recruited mainly from as well, he dealt with that?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And they were given- were they given any training?    Yes.    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.  No, that is fine.  Are there- is there any request that we start earlier or we should be fine, we are starting normal time?    Normal time.   Okay.  No, that is fine.  This is the last week of the aviation weeks?  That looked very far at some stage.    Okay.  We are going to adjourn for the day and tomorrow we will start normal time.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair.      We are indeed.  Chair this morning there is first a matter of an application for the first witness to give his evidence in-camera.  I use that term loosely again as I did previously this week because there are only specific respects in which the witness seeks not to have his identity disclosed.  He is however legally represented and I would like to offer anopportunity for my learned friend to introduce himself and move that application if I may?    Chair that was the original plan.    That his evidence would be received first.  I will just need to confer with Mr Mbikiwa about whether there is anything lost in a reversal of the order.    Some of the planning of today envisaged his evidence first.    And then the move to the second witness.    Having said that though there is a further supplementary affidavit that I know my learned friend was going to hand up to you today.      Dealing with at least the identification of Mr Y.    I do not know – he will make submissions on it.  It is not clear to me that it resolves the crisp issue.     That you have raised.   But maybe he must address that and we see where we go.    If I could just take a moment.    To just consider whether there could be a reversion of the order.    Thank you.   Chair.    I have chatted to my learned friend.  We – we are of the view that we could reverse the order.    That it is not essential that we have Mr X before Ms Dlamini – Mr Y – my goodness that is – I am so glad my learned friend is doing Mr Y’s evidence because it is less likely that he will make this error.    So we could certainly reverse the order.    Chair I do not think so.    The witness is present with us in the room.    And provided I just get the right files in front of me we will be ready to go.    Chair if I may call Ms Dlamini to take up herposition in the witness area?    Thank you Chair.  Ms Dlamini you have in front of you a soft file and you will see that it is paginated in the top right hand corner with red pagination numbers.  Those will be the numbers I will be referring to today in the course of your evidence.  Chair for record purposes if we could enter as Exhibit DD24 Ms Dlamini’s affidavit and accompanying annexures?    And Chair just for the transcription purposes.   Ms Dlamini’s name is spelt as follows   Thank you.      Ms Dlamini I would like to begin on page 1 of your affidavit if we may.  Because you indicate in the first line where you are employed.  Where is that?    Thank you.  Ms Dlamini can I just suggest that you bring the microphone even just a bit closer.  It is important that we – we get your testimony as clear as possible for the purposes of the transcription.   And in what position are you employed there?    And what does that mean in the context of theagency?    So are you responsibilities particularly directed to vetting exercises conducted by the agency?    And do you – do you have any other role outside of vetting?    And what does that role require of you, the Project Manager role?    Yes.    Well what – what role you play as Project Manager?    Have you played that role of Project Managerfor vetting previously – prior to the SAA vetting or subsequently?    And that is the appointment as Project Manager of the specific vetting operation at SAA, is that correct?    And since then have you been the Project Manager of any other vetting operations?    And subsequent to that have you been in that position since then?    Thank you.  And in terms of your qualifications what qualifications do you hold?   Thank you.  And when did you join the State Security Agency?    And have you always been involved in the vetting operation side?   Thank you.  Ms Dlamini you indicate at the outset in the first few pages of your affidavit the request that was received from the commission and you detail the information that you were required to provide.  That is in – by way of background and then you actually commence at page 6 of your affidavit to provide that information.  So I would like to move us there if we may?  Page 6 of Exhibit DD24.      Yes.      So you will see at the bottom there you have a heading called The Vetting of SAA Executives and Support Staff.  Ms Dlamini just before we move into that just to orientate ourselves in the evidence. Chair you will recall that when we had the previous aviationsession there was some evidence received about security vetting that had been conducted within SAA.  You heard evidence in two respects in relation to that.  There was evidence of Ms Nhantsi who towards the end of her testimony indicated that there had been a particular interaction that she had had with Ms Myeni after some of the results of this vetting exercise had been made known to Ms Myeni.  I will come to that in the course of Ms Dlamini’s evidence.  But the other respect in which the commission has already heard about this vetting was in the evidence of Ms Thuli Mpshe.  Because she gave evidence about the concerns that had been expressed by management of SAA at the timethat this vetting operation took place.  And so the investigations of the commission subsequent to that evidence has been to engage the State Security Agency and obtain more information about how that vetting operation came about and was conducted.  And so it is my intention to deal with that aspect today with Ms Dlamini.  Ms Dlamini you start at the bottom of page 6 and you explain first of all how it came about that this vetting operation was conducted at SAA.  Can you please tell us about that?    I would like to go to that correspondencebecause as you indicate you have attached it to your affidavit and you will find the first letter at page 17, 17 of DD24.      17 Chair, 17.    Do you have that page?  17.    And what is this document?    Thank you.  And just for the transcribers Mahlobo is spelt M-a-h-l-o-b-o.  That is Mr David Mahlobo who was then the Minister of State Security, is that correct?    Now this letter did you see it at the time that it was prepared?    Did you see it before you commenced the vetting operation?    Okay we will come to that letter in a moment.  Let us just deal with the letter at 18.  What is the date of the letter according to the second page?    I am on page 18 of Exhibit DD24.    Which is the second page of the letter we are looking at.  And I was asking what date is indicated on that page?    And you indicated that it was a letter written by Minister Mahlobo – former Minister Mahlobo to former Minister Nene, is that correct?    And I understand you to say you did not seethis at any stage before you conducted the vetting operation, is that right?    Yes so let us just be clear.  This letter did you see it at the time?    No.    When did you first see this letter?    But was it at some point during the vetting operation?    Did you read the letter when you came to beaware of it?    Please could you indicate what is stated in the letter at paragraph 2?    We will go to that letter in a moment.  And – so that is paragraph 2 of Minister Mahlobo’s letter to Minister Nene.  What does Minister Mahlobo record in paragraph 3?    Okay let us read what he precisely says that mandate is.  If you could read from the third line.  As I have it it starts “as per” will you read from “as per section 1”?    Do you know the Provisions of the National Strategic Intelligence Act that deal with vetting?    Do you know the Provisions of the National Strategic Intelligence Act that deal with vetting?   Does the - does Section 1 of the Act - as Minister Mahlobo records here - say what is in quotations in paragraph3?    Thank you Chair.  You will see Ms Dlamini at paragraph 3 Minister Mahlobo indicates that Section 1 …    Of the National Strategic Intelligence Act states    Please say yes.  The nod is not recorded.    Thank you and I am asking you is that what Section 1 of that Act says?    Yes.    Yes.    It still is unfortunately.    Did anyone pick that up?  That he was quoting a Section 1 of the Act that does not read like that.    Hm.    And anyone else pick it up?    And can …?    There is not.   No.  Alas.  It is …    Yes.  It is interesting.  It is part of what I intend to probe with Ms Dlamini today.    So what is quoted you confirm is not what Section 1 says of the Act and let me ask you.  Are you aware of any section of the Act that reads with the words in the quotations referred to in paragraph 3?   Indeed it is.  Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    You see because what is quoted here I want to suggest to you is far broader than what Section 2A of the Act actually says.  What is quoted here is that a section of the National Strategic    And you know what Section 2A provides.  Do you not?    Yes.   Let us go to the section to which you refer.  Chair, for that purpose you will need the legislation bundle.  I trust Ms Dlamini has a copy of the legislation bundle.  If not could I just request that one be made available to her?    That is fine, but I would like us to be on - on the same page in the bundle that I will be referring to.  So we will just make available to you the legislation bundle and you will turn up page 3-6-1.    Oh.    It may be next to you there Ms Dlamini.    On the side it should say “legislation”.  Can you just check the spine?    On the spine.  Yes.    That is precisely what we need to be working with.    Thank you so much and if you will turn up page 3-6-1.    Do you have that?    And that is the first page of the National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994.  That is the one we have been talking about.  Is that correct Ms Dlamini?  You will need to say yes.    It is.  Yes.  So one is the definition.  So that could not have been a correct reference in paragraph 3, but now we are moving to as Ms Dlamini has pointed out.  There is a section of the Act dealing with vetting.  It is not Section 1.  It is Section 2A and what we are looking at now is that Section 2A does not say what is quoted in Minister Mahlobo’s paragraph 3. So let us go to 2A.  You will find that at page 3-6-5.  Do you see Section 2A there Ms Dlamini?    Thank you and could you read for us what subsection one of that section provides?   No.  I think we are at the wrong.  You need to go a bit further down the page ….    To in bold 2A and then the heading is “Vetting Investigations”.    Could you read the rest of that subsection?    1A.   Thank you.  Do you agree that that Section 2Ais different to the words that appear in paragraph 3 of Minister Mahlobo’s letter?    We will look at the details of what Section 2A envisages in a moment, but I would like to just finish with the letter of Minister Mahlobo - if we may.  So if you will go back to DD24 and that is the exhibit containing your affidavit and turn to page 18, because that is the second page of Minister Mahlobo’s letter?  Can we go to paragraph 4 there?  Could you read into the record what paragraph 4 says?   I think it says companies.  Is that correct?    Thank you and paragraph 6.  Right.Ms Dlamini, can I get your understanding of what this letter was seeking to convey to Minister Nene, because as I understand your evidence it is because of this correspondence between the two Ministers.  That you were charged with undertaking the vetting operation.  Is that right?    I thought you had not seen it prior to it starting …    But you saw it in the course of the responsibilities.    Is that right?    But your affidavit before this Commission saysthe reason why there was going to be vetting undertaking at SAA at all is because Minister Mahlobo engaged with Minister Nene about it.  Is that correct?    And as evidence of that you have attached this letter to your evidence.  Correct?    We will deal with that in a moment …    Because this comes first in the chronology.  So what was your understanding based on this letter at the time or in terms of briefings that you were given as to why vetting needed to be undertaken at SAA?    And who - who conveyed that to you or was that your understanding?    And who was that?    And can I just be clear.  What you understood was because these management persons and their support staff were employed at a State Owned Company.   They were required to be security vetted.  Is that correct?    Hm.    Is that the only requirement that they just needed to be employed there and then they needed to be subjected to security vetting?    Hm.    So is - is the fact that they are employed enough to trigger the need for security vetting?    So it is not necessary that they in addition to being employed have access to classified information?    But it is not required?    Right.    When Minister Mahlobo motivates for this vetting operation in his letter to Minister Nene.  You will see that at paragraph 2 he seems to place some emphasis on the information that these people who are going to be vetted have access to, because you    Do you differ from him insofar as you regard it only being necessary that the person vetted is employed by the StateOwned Entity?    But not - so if he were to say, no.  You have to have access to classified information to be vetted.  I understand you to say you would disagree, because the mere fact of employment is sufficient.  Is that right?    What is your evidence?    Thank you.  You - you …    Indeed.    Okay.  It is quite important that we just get this clear, because I understood you earlier to say the - on its own the fact that you are employed by an organ of State such as a State Owned Company is enough to require you to be security vetted.  Is that correct?   And you would still need to be vetted?    Okay.    Thank you Chair.  I am indebted.  I have highlighted that Minister Mahlobo - and I accept Ms Dlamini it is Minister Mahlobo’s letter.  It is not your letter …    But Minister Mahlobo seems in the letter to pay some emphasis on the fact that these persons who are going to be vetted have access to sensitive information.  Do you see that?   Now I would just like to probe that a little bit with you.  What is the agency’s understanding of that link between the employees and sensitive information?  Must it be the case that the employees have access to such information to be vetted?    Is it a requirement that an employee who is going to be vetted must have access to sensitive information or is that not a requirement?    Right.    So you add the requirement of access to classified information for those who are rending services.  Is that right?    I understand that distinction.  Is your understanding that you describe now commonly the understanding amongst the people in the Vetting Division of the State Security Agency?    Okay.    No.  That is fine.    Do - do you have briefings about this?  Do you …?    And I - I fully appreciate that many of you may not be lawyers, but at some point has this understanding that you describe today being discussed amongst colleagues and understood?    Thank you.  I would then like to back - if wemay - to your affidavit at page 6 and you can actually turn over the page to page 7, because we are now going to deal with what your affidavit says about the exchanges between Minister Mahlobo and Minister Nene and what followed. At paragraph 3.2 you deal with what happened after the exchange of correspondence.  Can you tell us what that was?    Indeed.    Hm.    Let us just be clear.  What was the list a list of?   And who compiled that list?    And who sent the list through?    Right.  Let us go to those letters - if we may.  You will find the first one at page 19 of EXHIBIT DD24.   19 - 1-9.    So what is this letter?    And what date is indicated at the bottom of the letter?    And it appears to be - as you describe - a response to the letter we were just looking at.    Dated 13 October 2015.    Is that correct?   Do you see in the second paragraph that Minister Nene quotes the same Section of the Act that Minister Mahlobo quoted?    Yes.    He quotes it in the same terms that Minister Mahlobo quoted it.  Did he not?    Yes.    That is far more accurate Chair.  Far more accurate.  Let me use that exact description.  In the second sentence of the second paragraph Ms Dlamini.  What Minister Nene appears to do there is to purport to quote the Section 1 of the National Strategic Intelligence Act and he purports to quote it in the very same language that Minister Mahlobo quoted it.  Does he not?    And that we have already resolved is not what the Act says.  Does it?    Yes and it goes on at paragraph 3 to talk abouttwo separate letters dated the 2 n d and 5 November 2015 from the SAA Board Chairperson Ms D Myeni which lists all Executive Management and support staff as per your request.  Do you see that?    So is this the letter that you were talking about to which the lists were attached?    So let us go to that list, because it is preceded by a letter on the next page which is at page 20 …   And what is that document?    Right and this is the list - a letter dated 2 November 2015.    Is that correct?    Now you see in that letter there is a list of Executive Management Members that are going to be vetted.  Is that correct?    And how many names are indicated there?   Right.    What - why do you say the whole list of names proceed this?    Hm.     see.    So just so we understand the document on the same terms.  What I understand Ms Myeni to be saying at page 20 - and correct me if your understanding at the time was different.  Was that this letter would include - I am now at paragraph 1.  She writes    And then if we go over the page there is a further letter.  Who writes that letter?    And that is dated 5 November 2015.  Is that correct?    And in the second line of that letter sheindicates - well first of all she refers to the previous letter on the 2 n d    Did you take note of whether the 13 names that had been included on the first list of - as Executive Managers who would be vetted ended up being increased in this more lengthy list?    More than 13 Managers were now going to be vetted pursuant to the list commencing at page 22.    So was your understanding that this list that commences at paginated page 22 to paginated page 28 comprised all the people that you needed to conduct …    Security vetting on?    And did you go through any process of working out who on this list was in Executive Management position and who was in support staff position?   And at that point did you work out whether the Executive Managers were confined to the original list of 13 or not?    The - the original list that Ms Myeni provides on 2 November …    Had a list of only 13 Managers …    But the list that commences at page 22 ends up with - I think - it is 118 people …    Who are going to be vetted.   Did you establish once you had worked out their positions whether the original list of 13 Managers had increased to include other Managers as well?    So I think the answer is no.  You did not …    Take steps …    Right.   And - and whose decision was it to vet Executive Management and support staff?     Alright, did you consider at all the question whether the Board members of SAA should not also be subject to security vetting?     No.      If I ask you now whether you think if theExecutive Management and support staff of SAA are being security vetted the Board members should also be security vetted, what would your answer be?     Sorry, just explain that to me.     What is MISS?    But I thought your understanding of the Act was that anyone employed by an Organ of State should be vetted.     So why aren’t ...[intervenes]      Or rendering a service, but let’s look at the – those who are ...[intervenes]      Indeed Chair, I am indebted.  Did anyone raise this with the respective ministers at the time that you were rolling out your vetting operation in SAA?     Do you think that ought to have been raised?     And as you sit here now today?     No not at all.  So we have clarified now as I understand it, just to be clear on your evidence Ms Dlamini is as you sit here today you think the members of the SAA Board should also have been security vetted?     Thank you.  I would like to return to your affidavit at page 7, and at page 7 you pick up at paragraph 3.3 the fact that you were appointed Project Manager ...[intervenes]      Thank you Chair.  I do actually have a follow up question from that before we go to MISS.     In the course of your vetting operation did you at any point assess whether the Executive Managers and Support staff that you were vetting had access to classified information?     Let’s go to – you mentioned MISS, that’s the Minimum Information Security Standards document.  It has been included in the legislation bundle that we were just looking at, and you referenced Chapter 5 of that document, you will find that at page 465 of the legislation bundle.  Do you have it in front of you?    Yes.     I think you were referring to Clause 1.5 on that page, is that correct?     So let us see what that clause says.   It says    So following on from the Chair’s questions earlier do you accept that if it was established that the members of the Board of SAA had access to classified information they would be required to be subjected to security vetting?     But they are not among the political appointees who won’t be vetted unless required by the President or their contract provides, are they?    No what I am asking is are they political appointees?     No, so that first sentence couldn’t apply to them, what does apply to them is the second sentence.     Which is irrespective of your level if you have access to classified information you must be vetted.     Is that correct?     So the conduct of this vetting operation was not compliant with MISS when it was conducted at SAA was it?     No what I am interested in is this paragraph of MISS to which you drew our attention says that irrespective of the level you are at if you are a person who has access to classified information you must be subject to security vetting, do you see that?     We have already confirmed that the Board members of SAA would have had that access, if anyone had it.     Yes, and what I say following on from that is they weren’t vetted in your security vetting operation at SAA were they?     So that vetting operation did not comply with this paragraph of MISS did it?     Thank you.  Ms Dlamini- oh Chair we are at quarter past, I am going to move to a new topic, so it may be convenient to take the break.     Thank you Chair.  Miss Dlamini we were before the break at page 7 of your affidavit and I had indicate that at paragraph 3.3 you record there that you were appointed as the project manager of the betting process, you have already given evidence this morning to that effect, is that correct?     And you say at paragraph 3.4 that you designed a project plan, is that right?       I would like to go to that project plan becauseyou attach it as an Annexure to your affidavit.  Let us just go to the first page to start with, that is at page 30, three zero of Exhibit DD(24).     30 Chair, three zero.     Can you confirm Miss Dlamini that the document that appears at page 30 and runs to page 42 of Exhibit DD(24) is the project plan that you compiled.     I would like to pick it up then at page 34, three four.     At page 34 you have a heading there against paragraph number 1.3, which reads project goals and objectives, do you see that?     Could you please read into the record what you recorded in this project plan, were the project goals and objectives?     And the next sentence?     Well can I ask first of all, it seems to me that that is an error in that sentence to refer to SSA, should that not be a reference to SAA?    Yes, it is an error we have made numerous times in our investigations because we confuse the A and the S, but is it correct that what you meant to record here is the objective is all classified and sensitive documents within SAA are accessed by personnel with valid security clearances, is that correct?     And how were you going to do that if you had not established at all in this vetting operation whether anyone at SAA had actually had access to classified information?     Now I understand that is an ideal, what I am asking is how could it have been an objective of this vetting exercise thatwas going to be conducted in respect of existing employees to ensure that they only had access to classified and sensitive documents if they had valid security clearances in a situation where no-one had at in any point in this vetting operation actually found out whether anyone at SAA did have access to classified information?     Miss Dlamini your evidence has been clear at the level of fact at no stage in this vetting operation did you or your team establish whether these executives or their support staff had access, is that right?     Miss Dlamini I am going to show you in due course that that is a legal requirement for any lawful vetting to be conducted at any State-Owned Enterprise.  I am going to tell you that now and I will take you there later, but I am not concerned with that for the moment.  What I am concerned with for the moment is your own projectplan and your own project plan says the reason why we are doing this is because we want to establish and find people through a security vetting process who have the requisite clearance to access a type of information that we did not take any steps to establish whether they were accessing at any point.     But you may not need to vet them, that is the other option available to you is it not?     Because if you do not establish whether they have access to the very information that you say they need security clearance for maybe then you should not vet them at all?     We will come to that in due course.     I think it is page 17 Chair.     Chair it is page 19.     Thank you Chair, I would like to then go back to your project plan.  We were looking at first of all the objectives that you identified, that was at page 34 I would like to go to page 35 if we may? That is of Exhibit DD (24).       Now you will see there is a heading there against the, number 1.5, do you see that?  Reading “Critical Success Factors.”     We are at page 35.     And this is still in the project plan that you devised and I was drawing your attention to the heading against item 1.5 which reads “Critical Success Factors,” do you see that?    And you have recorded there    Did you have a sense at the time that you were conducting this vetting exercise, what the level of Management Buy-In and Support was?     Were you satisfied with it?     You did not have a need at some point to go andmeet Miss Myeni down in Cape Town to say you were not receiving adequate support?     I asked you whether you were satisfied with the levels of Management Buy-In Support for the vetting exercise and you, I understood your answer to be yes, you were satisfied?     And then I said, I, well I am relying on what you said in your affidavit, I thought you said there was a point that you had to go meet Miss Myeni down in Cape Town because you were concernedabout the level of support and buy-in you were receiving?     So were you satisfied you did get their buy-in in the course of the vetting operation?     So when the seven executive managers resigned because of the vetting process was that not an indication that you did not have their support?     What did that indicate?     No, I fully understand the board being onboard because they were not being vetted, what I am concerned about is the 118 managers and support staff whom you vetted in a situation where seven of those executive managers resigned during the course of thisvetting operation and we have heard evidence before this Commission previously, that there was great unhappiness amongst the executive managers about the fact that they were being subjected to security vetting in jobs that they had never been forewarned would have this requirement and in circumstances where they had to give deeply personal information over to the State Security Agency, where those not matters that came to your attention?     Can I just clarify who was at those meetings that you are talking about?  You mention the board, you mentioned some members of the executive, previously you had indicated the Acting CEO, is that correct?     Was the interim, I think her position at the time was also Acting CFO in those meetings, Miss Nhantsi?  Was she also in these meetings where you were receiving feedback?     No, so are we just talking about the board and the Acting CEO?     I understand that, but you were reliant on him for the information about what the other executives were feeling, is that correct?     No, I am asking about who you were relying on to tell you whether there were other managers who were uncomfortable, unhappy or dissatisfied about this vetting operation.  What I understand you to say is your point of contact was the Acting CEO and it was withhim, and that was Mr Zwane at the time.  Is that correct?     Who you were engaging so you relied on him to give you this information correct?     Thank you, I would then like to go to page 38 of your project plan and pick it up there at item 2.3 on the page which is dealing with major project milestones, do you see that?     Now the fourth line within that table after theheading indicates that you gave a briefing to the Chairperson of the SAA board and presented the project plan and the date for that is the 13 January 2016, do you see that?     And then the next line item is that there was a briefing to the SAA board and presenting the project plan on the 14 January 2016, do you see that?     Why was there a need to brief the Chairperson on the day before the briefing of the board?     Just help me with that.  Where did the meeting on the 13  January 2016 take place with Miss Myeni?     In Durban?     So you travelled to Durban to meet with Miss Myeni to give her the same briefing that would be given the following day to the board, is that correct?    Sorry, then we were cross-purposes because when you designed the project plan you included that meeting, remember we were at page 38?    How could you have included this in the project plan if you did not know about the meeting before?    So, this was not a plan prepared in advance of the project.   Oh, so it was revised after its initial.    Okay.  So, let me get that right.  You arrange a meeting with Ms Myeni down in Durban.    Because she is the chairperson of the board, right.    Now if we go back to your affidavit at page 8 ... (intervenes)    Apologies Chair.    Yes.    It must be a 2015.    Ms Dlamini can I assist?    I do not think the second date can be the wrong one.  That is because you closed the project ... (intervenes)    On the 30 t h of July 2016.    So, you could not have had your stakeholder engagement after you have closed the project.    Is it not the error that it should be 8 December 15?    And so, despite the fact that you presented this project plan just following on from the Chair’s question, on the 11 t h of January 2016, your evidence has been this actual document was revised subsequently and that is how we get the insertion of the 14 t h of January.  Is that right?    Okay.  So, let me just get it right.  You were planning then only to meet with Ms Myeni on the 13 t h of January.  Is that right?    And you met with her in Durban and when you met in Durban, she then indicated; oh, there is a board meeting tomorrow in Midrand.      So maybe you should attend that.  Is that how it unfolded?   Okay.  So, then I would like to go back to what you said in your affidavit was discussed at that meeting with Ms Myeni.  You will find that at page 8 of Exhibit DD24.    So, at page 8 paragraph 3.5 you indicate that you had this meeting on the 13 t h of January and you indicate halfway down that paragraph what the purpose of the meeting was.    Just tell us what the purpose was.    Is that not something that you would have to getthe board or at least the executive members of the board to assist with?  How could Ms Myeni facilitate all of this on her own?    No indeed.      If you discuss it with them together.    But I understand your evidence to be you had intended only to meet with Ms Myeni on the 13 t h.   It was only in the course of that meeting that you were told about the board meeting the next day.    So, you went to her on the 13 t h to discuss aspects with her that she could not herself have executed.  Is that right?    Thank you.  So, there would of course have been a need notwithstanding that meeting to meet with the board, correct?    Right.    I understand that.    Let us then go to the stages of the vettingprocess and you pick that up at page 9 of your affidavit.  Sorry, just before I go there.  I did want to clarify one thing.  Was Ms Myeni at the meeting on the 14 t h?    Not.    Okay.    So, you saw her on the 13 t h and the board excluding her you saw on the 14 t h.  Is that right?   Right.  Okay.  So, you describe from paragraph 3.8 that there are various stages of a vetting project or operation.  Can you please take us through those three stages?    Four, apologies four.  There are four stages?    Mm-hmm.    I am.    Can I just say it is most important that the Chair follows, not me so.  If I can just ... (intervenes)    Thank you.    I would like to pick up on a few aspects of each of the stages.    Now in the first stage there is a form that has to be completed by the person being vetted and there is certain documentary information that has to be provided.  Is that correct?    That information that has to be provided is quite extensive is it not?    Yes.  We have an affidavit in your file from Ms Olitzki.  Ms Olitzki was Chair the person who Ms Nhantsi testified she hadhad a conversation with Ms Myeni about.  The evidence previously was that when Ms Myeni received feedback on Ms Olitzki’s security vetting, it was drawn to her attention that she had dual citizenship.  And Ms Myeni engaged Ms Nhantsi to take steps to have Ms Olitzki removed and wanted to use according to Ms Nhantsi’s evidence the fact of her dual citizenship as a basis for removal.    So, we have obtained an affidavit from Ms Olitzki who despite all of this still is employed by SAA.  And she has given us some indications of how much information needs to be provided in order to complete these forms and you will find that at page 70 of Exhibit DD24.   Yes 70.  Just for the record, the affidavit commences at page 68 of Exhibit DD24.  It is an affidavit by Lindsey Sharon Olitzki.  I will spell Olitzki O-L-I-T-Z-K-I.  And where I want to pick it up is at page 70 because there at paragraph 12 Ms Olitzki indicates the type of information, she had to supply in order to complete the form.  At paragraph 12 she says there; 12. The form required a significant amount of information re personal particulars, education, health, including questions re psychiatric treatment, alcohol and drug abuse and previous marriage or cohabiting arrangements.   13. In addition, details of family members, relatives was required including details relating to the country of birth and nationality.  Names and contact details of person who had known you for 5 to 20 years was also requested.  Plus, a full employment history as well as all visitsoutside the country, SAA member plus spouse for the past 5 years.  Also copy of passport pages. 14. Additional information required was a 3 month history of bank accounts, credit card accounts, vehicle and home loans plus a monthly income and expenditure budget and details of property owned and other sources of income. Ms Dlamini, I did have your evidence earlier to be you accept this is a substantial amount of information that needs to be handed over.  Is that correct?    And it includes personal and private information of persons, correct?    Personal and private.    Correct.    So that is the first stage.  They have to hand over all of this information.  And then they get to an interview, is that correct, that is the next stage?    Right.  And you have indicated to us that there are some guideline questions that must be covered in that interview.  Is that correct?    And you provided us as an Annexure to your affidavit with some of those questions.    I understand your evidence to be that they are guidelines.  They can be departed from.  Is that right?    Or is it fair to say that they provide the base from which questions are asked?    Yes.  And then depending on answers you mightwant to probe further ... (intervenes)    Or ask additional questions.  Is that right?    I would like to go to type of questions that are asked of people subjected to security vetting.  And you will find that from page 43 of your Exhibit DD24.  Page 43, do you have that?    So, Ms Dlamini, I am just going to highlight some of the questions.  This is a fairly detailed document comprising I think seven pages.  But what I want to highlight in the course of this and have you comment on afterwards is that not only is all that documentary information required to be provided to the State Security Agency.  But when you arrive for your interview you are going to be asked a series of questions that engage deeply private and personal matters.  And I wouldlike to highlight the questions for you that I say are of that quality.   Okay.  So, on page 43 you get asked a whole lot about your family background and upbringing and amongst the questions midway down that page is whether all the children in the family were treated fairly while growing up.  Do you see that?    It is sort of in the middle of the page.  Were all the children treated fairly while growing up?    Do you see that?   Do you accept that that is quite a personal question?    And further down about two thirds of that way down you also get asked; were any of your parents or brothers or sisters abusing alcohol, drugs or substances?  And if the answer is yes, you have to tell the vetting officer what that was.  Do you agree that that is quite personal?    Mm?    It is.    Yes.   Let us look at some of the other items.  You get asked the question after that; did any of your immediate family receive counselling or psychotherapy?  And if they did, you have to tell this member of the State Security Agency about the psychological treatment that one of the members of your family received.  Is that right?    You then get asked at the bottom of that page to describe your spouse’s personality.  Do you see that?   And that also is a personal matter.  Is it not?    And then over the page at page 44.    You get asked as the fourth question on this page; if you had your live over again would you marry your spouse?    Yes.  You accept that is a fundamentally personal question?  A question the answer to which you probably would not have ever communicated to your spouse.    Indeed.  Correct.  I am anticipating when you do not want to answer the question.  So true.  Deeply personal.   Yes.    Yes.    Of course, but this ... (intervenes)    Indeed, because this was an operation that wasconducted at SAA.    In which a 118 people were asked these questions.  Right.  But further of the way down.  What kind of relationship was there between your parents?  Again, that is personal, is it not?    In the middle of the page.  What kind of influence do relationships have on the marriage?  They are talking there about how you relate to your parents in law.  Do you see that?    And then you are asked.  Do you believe in having more than one partner at a time?  And you are asked to explain your answer, correct?    Again, deeply personal.  And you are even asked;if you have lost your spouse, at the bottom of the page, how your children coped with the death of your spouse?  Do you see that?    Are these people given any counselling before or after they answer these questions in a vetting operation?    No.  But they know it is going to be followed by a polygraph test, do they not?    So, they dare not answer any of these questionsfalsely dare they?    Well if they want to succeed and get their security clearance, they better give truthful answers to these questions.  Is that not correct?    Yes.  Let us go to page 45.  You are asked all about your employment behaviour and then two thirds of the way down you are asked about you deal with stress and pressure.  Do you see that?    That is also personal, is that right?    Thank you.    Okay.  Let me read the final questions because I think your answer is going to be the same.  And then I will just record them for the record and you will tell me if you accept that they are all personal.  At page 46 you are asked about whether you are social and whether you go to bars and clubs.  You are asked when you attend parties or socials what you talk about.  You are asked whether you hang out with men or with women.  You are asked what you see as luxuries.  You are asked whether you are the type of person to make impulsive decisions with regard to buying things.  At page 47, you are asked about whether you borrow money on aregular basis from your friends or family and whether you pay it back on a regular basis.  You are asked what stores you have accounts with and whether you are involved in any form of gambling.  And if so, you must explain how often you do so.  You are asked about whether you belong to a church.  Whether it guides you in your life.  What principles you live by.  You are asked about whether you belong to a religion.  You are asked about whether you are a member of a political organisation and whether the organisation is what you believe in.  You are asked about whether you think it is wrong to change your believes on a regular basis and to give the reasons for that.  At page 48, you are asked about what you feel about the government of the day and whether you are happy with the current situation our land.  You are asked what role in political originations- what your role is in political organisations and how you attend to that role.  You are asked how you feel about the existence of radical organisations. And the you are asked about your personality.  You are asked about whether you are predictable.  What you do when you are angry.  How you deal with it.  And what you do after an argument.And on the last page, page 49, you are asked that if you were a- if the person questioning you were you friend.  They say, could they trust you with their secrets.  You are asked what you think about manipulation.  You are asked whether you are bribable.  And you are asked what you will do if you are ever bribed or blackmailed.  Ms Dlamini, I have not read all the questions.  I have read the ones which when I went through this, I thought highlighted the extremelyinvasive nature of these questions.  And the extend of your personal life that you have to disclose when you are subjected to security vetting.  Do you accept that all of these questions are of that nature?    Indeed.    Indeed.      Right.  Let us then return if we may to the polygraph stage because as I understand it, we are now at stage three.  You have been asked all of those questions in the interview stage and now you are going to proceed to the polygraph stage.  And that is at pageof your affidavit in Exhibit DD24.  Now Ms Dlamini what you say here at paragraph 3.8.3 is that and I am just going to read if I may the first two sentences. During this stage the official will be subjected to a polygraph in order to determine the reliability of the information gathered during the investigation.  It is mainly conducted in respective Top-Secret clearances, however in certain instances it may be used in other levels of clearances where the investigations require the determination of the reliability of the information gathered.  After the interview the officer writes a report.Okay.  What I am interested in is how did the decision- how was the decision taken in respect of the SAA officials whether to subject themto polygraph test?    So how did you decide to vet them at a Top-Secret level?    But do you not have to know whether they are ever going to be in receipt of Top-Secret information?    So, let me just understand that.  Just because the people you were vetting were executives of a state-owned company, is there an automatic application then that they must receive Top-Secret clearance?    Right.  And at no point prior to this does anyone ever find out whether they actually ever going to get Top-Secret information.  Is that correct?    And they’re support staff, why did they get polygraphed?    No, I think the question is different.  I understand that this operation at SAA involved interviews and then polygraphs of allthe people interviewed.  Is that correct?    Yes.  Amongst the people interviewed were numerous support staff.  Why were they polygraphed?    Chair I am not sure ... (intervenes)    The Commission engaged with the State Security Agency before this evidence about the reports that had been generated.    And those reports were not provided.  But part of what was requested was that in your affidavit you would have had a look at those reports and you would give us an indication in so far as the polygraph questions were concerned what the standard polygraph questions were that emerged from those reports.  Do you remember thatrequest?    I did not find that in your affidavit.  Can you help us today with the answer to that question?    What- when you looked at the reports of the polygraphs, right.    As you were requested to do.  The Commission was interested to know what types of questions over and above those standard questions were being asked of those persons subjected to polygraphs?    Are you able to assist us with that?    Okay.    My understanding was it was going to be covered in the affidavit.  Is it the case that you were not able to do so at the time of providing the affidavit?    I understand.    And as you sit here today you have not done that exercise?    So, you will need to go back.    I understand.  Thank you.  So, I had misunderstood that and I am grateful for the clarification.  So, it was only executive managers, not they’re support staff who were polygraphed.  Is that correct?    And I understand your evidence to be the reason for that is because as soon as you are an executive management in a state-owned company you must be cleared for Top-Secret.  Is thatcorrect?    And that is the default position irrespective of whether any particular executive manager is ever actually going to see Top-Secret information.  Is that right?    And does that strike you as odd Ms Dlamini?    Oh, explain why?    You see it is the Top-Secret level that requires the polygraph, right?    Is Top-Secret the highest level?    Why would you apply the highest level and not the lowest level if you do not know what information they actually are accessing?    I do not –    What I asked is, if you do not know what types of information.    The executives have access to why do you decide to clear them for the top security clearance and not the lowestsecurity clearance?    What is SMS level?    Because there is some rule somewhere?    Well we have already traversed that Ms Dlamini    It is not clear that it was ever stated.   Can I just ask when the managers were briefed were you involved in that briefing that happened in I think it was January 2016?    Who conducted that briefing?    Were – do you know whether the executives were told that they could refuse the polygraph?    Yes you know that they were told that they could refuse it?    Did you find out afterwards what was communicated to managers about whether they could refuse the polygraph?   And did you come to have any sense of whether the managers who were subjected to the polygraph were told that they had to take the polygraph?    Do you accept that they ought to have been told that they are entitled to refuse it?    Yes.    That is a question about whether it happened?    What I am interested in is do you accept that in accordance with the application of the proper vetting procedures theyshould have been told that they are entitled to refuse the polygraph?    Yes.    Ms Olitzki’s affidavit says that they were told that they needed to do the polygraph.  Do you have any basis to dispute what she says they were told?    So I think the answer is no?    Thank you.  I would then like to go to the valuation stage that is – you deal with at page 11.    You say   Are you aware that the vetting regulations say that an applicant must be notified in writing of the outcome of a vetting operation?    Did you take steps to ensure all of the people who were vetted at SAA received that feedback in writing?    And what did you establish about that?    Yes.   So – sorry – so what did he say?  Did he say to you that the outcomes had been communicated to the rest of the executive management and staff?    Sorry I just need …    Could you provide that correspondence to us after today?    So this was a verbal communication?    Because the regulations require the agency to ensure that this information is given to the person who has been vetted, is that not correct?    So am I to understand you that in performance of that duty you tasked the acting CEO, Mr Zwane with the responsibility for communicating it?    Would you be surprised to learn that at least two of the current SAA managers who were subjected to that vetting were not ever told that outcome?    And would you be concerned as well as surprised?    Thank you.  And then I would like to go to page 12 of your affidavit if we may?  At that paragraph, this is actually the point I was referring to earlier Ms Dlamini about your meeting with Ms    And did you take steps to find out the reasonswhy in respect of those who were outstanding they had not been submitted?    But then you arrange an urgent meeting with Ms Myeni, is that correct?    And why did you schedule that meeting?    And just tell me how would they taint the integrity of the process if they did not want to subject themselves to security vetting?    And what were those targets?    The top 100 included support staff, is that right?    Yes, yes.    But they would necessarily have to include support staff. I do not understand there to be 100 managers at SAA or am I wrong?    Yes.  Thank you.    And what was Ms Myeni’s response when you raised these challenges with her?    And do you know what steps were taken toassist?    But you do say later in your affidavit there was a great improvement after that point?    You do not know?    I understand that.  There was just the point about the questions that were asked Ms Dlamini at the polygraph.  Iunderstand you say you have not done the exercise to consider.    Those reports.  But as you sit here today would you have any basis for disputing what Ms Olitzki has indicated were the type of questions she was asked?    But at the time you compiled your presentation at the end of this vetting exercise.    Had you at that stage looked and seen the evaluation of the various reports that had been received from your vetting officers?    No I am actually not interested in a particular case.  What I am interested in is we only had access to Ms Olitzki and a Mr Moonsamy whose affidavit will be referred to later today.  And they told us the type of questions they were asked and Ms Olitzki said she checked with two other of the managers who had been subjected to security vetting.  It would have been much better for us of course if we had got it from the agency.  But what I am saying to you is her evidence and that of her colleagues was that they were only asked four or fivequestions in the polygraph test.  Is that customary to ask such a few number of questions?    Thank you Chair I am indebted.  Ms Dlamini after today it would be useful for the commission also to be provided with those standard polygraph questions.    Because as I understand it the ones you have given us are the guideline questions for the initial interview, correct?    Oh because those are about more than 100 questions.  So – and I understand your evidence to be at the polygraph stage there are only 7 or 8, is that right?    Yes.    I did not find in those guideline questions any question related to whether the person had leaked confidential information – SAA information to other parties.  Are you aware of that being a standard question?    I should have asked the question differently.  Is that a standard question?    You do not know?    I want to suggest to you it could not be because it is specific to SAA confidential information.  So it could not be a standard question for polygraphs, could it?    No that is…    Well…   No, no, no.    Ms Dlamini might I make the suggestion.  We very close to the lunch break.    Maybe I could ask if you would during the lunch break just go over those guideline questions again.    You do indeed.  They are the ones that we – I understand you said were those that were attached from page 43, is that correct?    Yes.    No I thought that is what we just resolved.  I understood these not to be the polygraph questions, is that right?    Yes so that is why I said could you please provide those to us after today.    No we were at cross purposes.  Thank you so much.    No but then just over the lunch break if you can reflect on it and whether the question of leaking SAA confidential information is a standard polygraph question.  We would be indebted if you could assist us after the lunch break with that.    No I understand if you cannot do it.    If you cannot do it I thought I would ask.    Understood.    No I understand.    Just to explain my urgency in relation to this.  It was the matter that we asked be traversed in the affidavit today andwe do not have a great deal of time in this commission.  And I understand your evidence to be it was overlooked and I fully understand that.  But if after today you could provide us with that information we would be grateful.      Chair I indicated – we almost at the lunch break.    But we have a lot of logistics for the nextwitness.  Can I say in respect of Ms Dlamini we would need to return a bit after lunch but not for very long I am really in the concluding sections of the questioning.    And we fairly confident that we would complete the second witness still today.    But there is the application for the second witness’ evidence to be given in-camera.  My proposal was that we deal with it before the lunch adjournment so that logistics related to himcould be dealt with over lunch.  I am just slightly concerned from a message I have given that we may not have the affidavit at this point.    Oh we seem to have a version that has not yet been redacted.  It is quite a process to redact.  But for the purposes now – do we have a copy that – Chair we have an un-redacted copy which if all we do is hand it up to you and it is moved un-redacted may not be a problem in order to facilitate it now.  But if we do require the redacted copies I – I just understand logistically that has not happened.    I – I am going to have to hand over to my learned friend.    Because it is their application.   Thank you.    Certainly Chair.    And may I just before I do that raise one point because my learned friend does not know the precise terms.    Of the order we gave in respect of Mr X.    The one addition if I could just be – pass a copy.  Chair if you just look at the draft order that has been handed to you.    The – the paragraph 2 on Mr X’s order onlyrequested that his name not be disclosed.    Right but the request of this witness is that his name and other identifying features also not be disclosed.  So I just wanted to draw to your attention.    Oh.   You and I have the wrong version then Chair.    Because…    Let me – let me just clarify.    Yes.    I think the numerous versions today.    Suggests you and I have got the wrong one.    Could I just read into the record we will make sure that there are copies sufficient.   Chair.    There is another copy.    But it refers to the State Security Agency as the applicant.    But we have resolved that.    As I understand it.  If I can simply hand you up the correct wording for paragraph 2?  But we will after this Chair ensure that it correctly reflects the applicant as Mr Y.    Chair this was the draft order that was handed to my learned friend this morning from the evidence leaders.    Prior to your engagement.    About Mr Y needing to be the applicant.    And so all I would like to draw your attention to is that paragraph 2 is broader than it was for Mr X.    You will see there it is – the witness’ name, hisposition within the agency and the nature of his duties should not be disclosed in his evidence.    So I needed to draw your attention to – just to that discrepancy so that there was no misunderstanding as to its being a replica of Mr X’s order.  But then on the question of notice.    Chair the – the…    It is the same.   Indeed Chair.    Then on the question of Notice to implicated persons.  The steps that were taken by the legal team on receipt of Mr Y’s main affidavit plus this application was to send Rule 3.3 Notices to all persons implicated in the main affidavit.    And all that we did in the Notice was we continued to maintain the confidentiality about the witness’ identity.  And so rather than referring to him by name we indicated in the Notice that a witness who will make application to have his identity not disclosed will implicate you in the following respects.   So that process has taken its course and it was done timeously.    And I can tell you that we have received no responses.    Thank you.    I think that will be helpful Chair.    Logistics.    Indeed.    Thank you Chair.    We are indeed, Chair.   Thank you.  Ms Dlamini, before we broke for the lunch adjournment we were on page 13 of your affidavit - EXHIBIT DD24.  Do you have that in front of you?    And what we had been dealing with was your follow up with Ms Myeni when you were concerned about impacts on the integrity and progress of the process and then you indicated that there had been quite an improvement after that.  Is that correct?    And you indicate on page 13 - towards the bottom at paragraph 3.15.  That final a report was prepared.  I assume that is in relation to the vetting.  Is that correct?    And it was - and it was presented toMinister Mahlobo in January 2017.  Is that right?    Now that was attached to your affidavit.  So I would like to just take you to that presentation and it commences at page 50 - 5-0.    Is this a presentation you prepared?    And it says on the first page - page 50 there    “…on 17 January 2017.” Is that correct?    Did you present this presentation?    So did you - did you ever actually present it at any meeting at SAA or otherwise?    SAA.    No.  So what was this prepared for?   The Board?    And despite it saying “presented by” …    You did not actually present it.  Is that correct?    Do you know whether it was presented?    Okay, but this was your final …   Hm.    That is helpful.  Thank you Chair.    So it was prepared by you …    And this is at the conclusion of the vetting exercise.  Is that correct?    So I would like to just take you to a few items within this.  Ms Dlamini, we have already traversed the respect in which your project plan had identified the objective of the vetting exercise.  Ido not suggest that we go over that again.    You have had a lot of questions, but I do just want to note for the purposes of the record that the same objective is recorded when you came to finalise this report on the vetting exercise and you will find that at page 53.  Do you see there the second paragraph reads in the same terms that your project plan read?  Sorry.  You might - page 53 - 5-3.    Do you have that?   So the second paragraph there read - I think in exactly the same words. “The objective is to ensure that all classified and sensitive documents within … “I think it is again supposed to be … “…SAA are accessed by personal with valid security clearances.” Do you see that?    So both at the inception and at the conclusion of the vetting process you describe its objective in these terms.  Is that correct?    And then I would like to go to page 60 - 6-0.   Thank you.    So at the top of that page you talk about the    Are strikes and serious disturbances things that sometimes do occur when vetting operations are carried out?    Were - were you alerted to the fact that there was dissatisfaction or concern amongst the Executives that might have led them to raise these issues with the unions?   No?    But you still thought it necessary to record that?    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    And in the penultimate bullet on that page …    Thank you Chair.  Ms Dlamini, the second last bullet on that page.    You record that   Did you make that request to him verbally?    And did he communicate this information to you verbally?    And he specifically said that there was a R2 billion turnover that SAA had achieved as a result of this vetting project?    So did - were you the one who then when you described it here related it to the vetting project?    Ms Dlamini, on what possible basis could a movement in the turnover of SAA be causally linked back to the vetting project?    Hm.    Over the page you list some of the other impacts of the project.  The first of those at page 61 is the resignation of seven Executives Managers.  Do you see that?    61.    So seven Executive Managers resigned.  Is that correct?    And then on the third bullet on that page you    Do you see that?    Which were those other entities?    Well let us unpack that a bit.   You say the great success of the SAA Vetting Project.  What - what was the great success about it?    What were you able to advice?    What risks?  What advice were you able to give?    Okay.  Take me to those if you will.    Sure.   Hm.    I - I must say I do not.    So that is actually why …    I have asked for Ms Dlamini’s assistance.    No.    There is a - there is a …    Sort of contents page, but it does not give a reference point.    Hm.    So just help me again.  What then was the great success of the project?    Oh.  Sorry.  No.  That I do know where that is.  That is at page 62.    Sorry.  I had also thought we were looking for findings, but this is - I - is this page where their risks identified?    But the heading says “Risks Identified”.    Yes.    Oh.    Oh.    No.  I have not seen that.    Okay.  So …    There was supposed to be in this presentation some recordal of the risks that you had …    Identified.    That is correct?    Okay.  Tell us now what were those risks?    Yes.    It - it would have been helpful for them to be provided today …   But let us just get the evidence as at today.    You cannot recall what the great success was …    Of the SAA Vetting Exercise?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Okay and you say at that same bullet   Oh.   Hm.    I see.    So it was anticipating a request that would then be acted upon.    Is that right?    And you thought that that would be a positive result out of this process.    Is that correct?    Right.    Why would that be?  Why would you want to vet pilots?    That was the request.  Was it not?    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Who was that request from to vet the pilots?   Ms Myeni?    Did you intend at any point to determine whether you could lawfully vet the pilots or would her request have been enough?    Hm.    Hm.    And then if we go to page 65.  Could you not have given those two recommendations without conducting the vetting?    Well let us take each of them.  I want to suggest to you that all you needed to do was go to SAA.  Have a meeting with the Board and Management.  Ask them whether in the terms of the contracts of employment of the existing Executives they had a clause that required them to be subjected to vetting and if the answer in that meeting was, no.  There are not.  Then you could have given that advice on that day.  Correct?   Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    No.  What I am probing Ms Dlamini.    Is whether you have to subject 118 Managers and support staff at SAA to invasive security vetting procedures if you tell us that the two great success of this project were things you could have done without vetting a single person and let me just be clear about it. The first one you gave us was that you were able to advise SAA about revisiting their recruitment.    So that they could include in their contracts …    With employees that they must subject themselves to vetting.    I want to put it to you.  You could have given that advice after one engagement with Management and the Board of SAA.  Establish that it is not in the contracts and advise them to put it in.  What is your response to that?    Thank you.  We will actually come to the point about corruption …    But you gave a second great success and that was the recommendations you made regarding the requirement that there be a declaration of secrecy undertaken by Executives.  Did I have that correct?   Yes.    So again I want to suggest to you that that was a recommendation that could have been made without the need to conduct any part of the vetting exercise.    That is precisely what I am … (intervenes).   Hm.  Hm.    Just specifically on …     Ms Dlamini you do refer to corruptioncombating at page 65 of your reports.     Could you go there?     In the penultimate bullet on page 65 you record SAA has expressed satisfaction regarding the significant role the Agency continues to play in combating corruption, do you see that?     How did your vetting operation assist in combating corruption at SAA?     Ms Dlamini I am going to come back to whether that is the first step, but I want to for the present set ofquestions accept what you’ve said that the first step towards combating corruption is to do security vetting and ensure that the people who are employed in these State owned companies are persons of integrity, have I captured that correctly?     Okay when people who were vetted didn’t get security clearance why were they allowed to retain their jobs?     What does that mean?     But Ms Dlamini that means your security vetting exercise can have no impact on curbing corruption.   Let me explain to you why.   If security vetting is a necessary step towards securing against corruption in an entity then it has to be effective, you have to be able to do your security vetting, determine that somebody shouldn’t be given clearance and then be able to get rid of them.  If your evidence today is you can’t take that step then the entire exercise has no purpose.     Thank you Chair.  Ms Dlamini I promisedearlier in the evidence I would take you to the law, because I suggested that the understanding that you describe of when security vetting can take place in State Owned Enterprises is not correct.   I want to be clear about why I am doing this, I am not suggesting that you are lawyer, what I am – what is relevant for this proceeding is what your understanding of the law is, and what the understanding of your colleagues are who conduct vetting exercises.   You have made it clear in your evidence today that your understanding, and I have your evidence to be it is an understanding shared in the vetting department of the State Security Agency, is that you can vet all employees of State Owned Companies, is that correct?     Yes, yes.     Oh you must, apologies, it’s a must.       And you have also confirmed that you don’t need to check before you do that whether they have access to classified information or not, correct?     Yes, no but the answer, I have ...[intervenes]      Okay, let’s go to Section 2A if we may, it is in the legislation bundle at page 365.     The legislation bundle, yes, it is the big one in front of you and it is page 365.     So I just would like to read for the record and     Now as I understand it, it is that section on which you rely for the evidence today that is your understanding that you can – you must vet everyone who is employed at an Organ of State, is that correct?     Ms Dlamini I would agree with that understanding ...[intervenes]      Oh my goodness, it is entirely possible.     Chair it happens at around three o’clock in the afternoon.     That I called you Ms Myeni?     Oh goodness, maybe I did.     You see this side of the room are my supporters, I don’t think they are necessarily ...[intervenes]     No and can I just say for the transcript purposes if I did make that error please it is Ms Dlamini who is giving evidence today.     Yes, and Mr Myeni and there was that confusion.     Ms Dlamini we were looking at Section 2A.      And you were explaining that that’s where your understanding is derived from.   Now what I am about to say if that section read as follows and said the relevant members of the National Intelligence Structures may conduct a vetting investigation ... and then it left out the words that follow ... and continued ... if such a person is employed by or an applicant to an Organ of State, then I could see it having the meaning that you attribute to it.   Do you see that?        Yes, but the problem Ms Dlamini is that those words do appear there, the words “in the prescribed manner to determine the security competence of a person” is there, and what that means is we have to go in the Act to the definition of security competence, to know when it is that vetting investigations can beconducted by members of the National Intelligence Structures, and you will find the definition of security competence at page 363.     Thank you.   So you will see a definition of security competence there, just below halfway down the page, the     Yes, so when you read Section 2A with that definition I want to tell you the meaning I give it and then I would like you to tell me whether you have a different understanding of it.   You see 2A is an empowering provision, it says members of the NationalIntelligence Structures may conduct an investigation in the prescribed manner to determine the security competence of a person, and in order to know what may lawfully be included in a security vetting operation you have to know what security competence is, and security competence is a person’s ability to divulge confidential information.  Do you accept that that’s the meaning of security competence?     I want to put it to you, and you can tell me if your understanding is different, that what is required for lawful vetting of investigations to be conducted at Organs of State is that you have todetermine first whether there is a person who has an ability to cause confidential information or material to fall into unauthorised hands, and once you have identified that there are persons who have that ability then you can conduct vetting investigations.     But you accept your understanding requires certain words in Section 2A to be deleted?     On a pure understanding of the language I think we accepted that those words could be removed in order for your meaning to apply, is that correct?    Yes.     Chair I am indebted.  Ms Dlamini there is onepoint and I made the error and I got a furious note from my colleagues when I made it, when we look at the definition of security competence I don’t want us to not use the language that is recorded there, it is not actually – it does not actually say access to confidential information, it talks about access to classified information, which has a very particular meaning in a security setting.       So what I would like to emphasize is that on the description that the Chair has just given you, it is not simply – the relevant question is not simply whether a person has access toconfidential information.     Because there might be reams of confidential information.     It is actually classified information, do you accept that?  That that’s what security competence is concerned with?     Right, and then if I tell you that no manager at SAA has ever accessed classified information, would you have any basis on which to dispute that?     Indeed, but you never checked whether they did have access to classified information or not?     Because Miss Olitski[?] in her affidavit makes it clear she has been at SAA at the time of deposing to her affidavit for eight years, so that means she started in 2012 and in those eight years she has never, she is the head – let me just get this right, because I got this wrong the other day when I referred to someone as the Head, but she is at page 68 the Head of Department for Financial Accounting at South African Airways.   In her affidavit she says the following about classified information; you don’t necessarily have to go there, you can just askme to give you the reference for where I make this claim.  It is at page 72 in EXHIBIT DD24, feel free to go there if you wish, but I will read it     Do you accept or let me ask differently ...[intervenes]      Security Competence is at page 363.     Thank you Chair.   Ms ...[intervenes]     Certainly.        Of course.     Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair just before we continue I have been asked to get some indication of the planning for the reminder of the afternoon, just because it does have an impact on arrangements that are being made for the second witness.     Tomorrow we have a new scheduled witness to commence but I have been discussing the situation with Mr Mbikiwa who will be presenting the evidence of the second witness today, our sense isthat even if we do go to 16H30 or 17H00 we will not quite complete his evidence so we would need the second witness of today to continue tomorrow and there will be a bit of a knock on effect for tomorrows witness and possibly the witness on Friday but we may be able to work that in, yes.     So can I take it that we will likely sit beyond 16H00 to a point.  Our great intention is for us to complete Miss Dlamini and at least start the second witness which will be helpful.     Thank you.  Miss Dlamini just in in conclusion on this point about security competence and what role it plays in vetting investigations, I would like to ask you the following question, If no one at SAA at any point had access to classified information do you accept that the security vetting that you conducted was then not designed to assesstheir security competence? If you will just turn on your microphone.       If the facts are that no-one at SAA had access to classified information, then the vetting exercise that you and your team conducted, could not have assessed their security competence?     No I am not touching that topic again, let me move on if I may.  Miss Dlamini I would like to put certain conclusions that I draw from the evidence today and I would like to give you an opportunity to comment on them.  I am going to look at both, what happened in the course of the vetting operation as well as its results afterwards.     Okay.  Miss Dlamini do you accept that the security vetting of SAA executives and support staff took place in a situation at which no point did anyone from SSA investigate whether the persons they were vetting in fact had access to classified information?     As far as your conduct of the operation was concerned, you at no point established whether the people who were being vetted had access to classified information.  Correct?     Thank you, and you had no basis to dispute the evidence of Miss Olitski which was to the effect that they were not told that they had an option to not take the polygraph test, do I have yourtestimony correct?     Indeed.     And Miss Dlamini as a result of the vetting that was conducted, seven executive managers resigned, is that correct?     Yes, and as a consequence SAA lost those skills of those seven executive managers, correct?    Yes.     Do you accept that if there were people in positions before the vetting operation and those peoples resigned during it, SAA lost the skills that those people brought to their positions.     No, I fully understand that.  You do not, you were not privy to their reasons.     I am asking a different question.  I am saying when people resign from State Owned Enterprises, do you accept that those State-Owned Enterprises lose the skills of those people?     In the course of the vetting operation, personaland private information of about a 118 employees of SAA were divulged to the Intelligence Services of South-Africa, do you accept that?     And whether or not a person passed or failed the vetting exercise, in fact had no impact at all on their jobs, did it?     So it did not?     Miss Dlamini I would like to put it to you as a consequence of that answer that there was no legitimate purpose that was then served by the security vetting, because if it had been legitimateand if it had sought to achieve the objective you identified, then any person who did not receive clearance ought not to have been permitted to remain in their jobs.     And should projects achieve the purposes that they are designed to achieve?     Do you accept that this project did not?     Let us talk about what did happen after thevetting, because you said State Security would have been available to engage with management and the Board on further processes and I want to know whether you are aware of this, these facts and if not I will ask you certain follow up questions.     We heard in evidence in this Commission that Miss Myeni the former Chairperson of the Board of SAA wanted to use the fact that Miss Olitski could not get clearance because she had dual citizenship to remove her from the finance role she occupied because she was not doing what Miss Myeni wanted her to do. Were you aware ofthose facts?     And if you are now aware of them would it cause you concern that the outcome of the vetting exercise was being used for an improper purpose?     Let us look at what happened to Miss Thuli Mshe, you see, Miss Mshe indicated that she was not willing to provide the required information to the State Security Agencies, and on the, Agency, and on the 19 t h January she received a suspension letter and one of the charges she faced was her refusal to provide the required information to SSA.  Would you be concerned that that was an improper use of the vetting exercise conducted at SAA?     Let me just give you the facts now.  Somebody who was in the Acting CEO position at SAA at a point in time, refused to provide the information required by the State Security Agency and the consequence of that is that one of the charges she faced when she was sought to be disciplined, was that she had not provided that information to the State Security Agency.  As you sit here today do you think that is an improper use of this vetting exercise?     Not at all.     Thank you, and do you Miss Dlamini accept that the people who conducted this vetting operation at SAA, had not been properly informed about the requirements of the legislation, in so far as security competence is a requirement for the purpose of vetting to be achieved?    Chair, I just have one or two concluding aspects but really to address to you about a summary at the end of the evidence.     May I proceed to that and then Miss Dlamini I am sure will be happy to be excused.     Chair, we will make submissions in due course to this Commission that the type of security vetting that was conducted at SAA and contrary to the views, it appears of both former Ministers, and indeed possibly those who executed the vetting operation, that that type of security vetting may not lawfully be undertaken unless it is first established that those who are to be vetted have access to classified information in a manner in which they may be able to divulge it to unauthorized persons.  Chair we will also likely in our submissionsrecommend that this clarification of the legal position find its way somewhere into any report prepared by this Commission because it has grave implications in all State Owned Enterprises if what is being conducted by the State Security Agency is vetting which does not comply in terms of the law.  Chair in closure I would just like to emphasize why in our submission the evidence today is in fact relevant to the mandate of the Commission, and we make two points in that regard.  Chair the Commission is tasked not only with establishing whether State Capture, Corruption and Fraud occurred within the Public Service Sector.  It is also required to explore how, if it did happen, it happened and whatrecommendations to make in due course in order to prevent its recurrence.  Chair it will be our submission that using the Intelligence Services of this country to conduct unlawful vetting operations at State Owned Enterprises and where that vetting operation is then employed for ulterior purposes, may well be shown to be one of the ways in which State Capture, Corruption and Fraud is allowed to take place in entities such as SAA.     Indeed Chair.     Indeed Chair.  Thank you.     Thank you Miss Dlamini.  If I may hand over to my learned friend Mr Mbikiwa.      We are waiting for it with great anticipation Chair. 
ADV DAVID MTSWENI:   Morning Chairperson.      My name is Advocate David Mtsweni I practice with the …     My name is Advocate David Mtsweni I practice with the Pretoria Society of Advocates.    On brief by the office of the State Attorney on behalf of a witness to be known as Mr Y for the record purposes.     Chair – Chairperson in a nutshell the reasons for why the – Mr Y’s evidence ought to be…     Chair I am told that the other one has got the – is redacted.     The other one is un-redacted – the un-redacted version.     And it should have almost…     Yes.     Yes that is the un – that is the redacted version.    Yes.     Yes on…     That is correct Chairperson.  The reasons Chairperson…     We – Chairperson we used the agency byvirtue of the agency being his employer but the best person to – can explain to you Chairperson the reasons why he evidence ought to be – should be in-camera would be the deponent himself.     He tells you that Chairperson at paragraph 1.3 of the affidavit.     We do – we do appreciate that Chairpersonbut we dealt with it – I think one of the things was the time constraints within which we had to bring the application.  But at the time when we decided to bring the application in the agency’s name was because we thought that it would be best because the agency – it is his employer and he is requested to appear before you Chairperson by virtue of him being employed by the agency not him, himself.     His identity.     No we do not do that.     Chair…     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Now Chairperson I have discussed this with my instructing attorney.  We have no objection – we have no problem in substituting Mr Y as the applicant and given now the change in sequence of the witnesses may that – may we then stand down for that purpose so that we can rectify the error in the meantime while Ms Dlamini gives her evidence.     Thank you Chairperson.    Chair      What we had done was to prepare the application in Mr Y’s name.     His real name.     But what we had sought in the Notice of Motion was that he be referred to as Y.     So the application is in Mr X’s full name.     Mr Y’s full name as Chairperson indicated earlier that it should be brought in his name.  But the court – the order that we proposed to hand up refers to him as Mr Y.     Chairperson.     Can I propose given the logistical issues?     We have of course in the Notion of Motion sought that he be referred to as Mr Y.     And I believe that Chairperson’s concerns can be dealt with by way of the redacted version as it was the intention much earlier.     But the affidavit in the sense is in his full name.     That is the application – that is the affidavit that will not be made available to the public.     But for the purposes of the – of the order dealing with his application – with his – with how his evidence would bedeal with we have referred to him as Mr Y the Applicant.     So the concern where you – Chairperson says it should refer as Mr Y we can simply just deal with that by way of the redacted version.     Yes.  Yes but what we had done because we had prepared a supplementary affidavit dealing amongst others the factthat Mr Y understands that although his identity and details will be protected that protection does not cover the version that is explained in his statement on which he will be led.  We just simply dealt with that and we also added a request that he should just be referred to as Mr Y for record purposes although Mr Y is not his full name.     Yes.     Yes Chair.     That is that…    No is as we received it from the evidence leaders which is in line with Mr X’s – with the one that Chairperson made in relation to Mr X.     We have no objection to that being made.     Yes Mr Chairperson.     That would facilitate the resolution of this.     It covers all our concerns Chairperson.     That can be done Chairperson.     We will just simply just …     Correct it later on and take out.     We will do so Chairperson.     Yes Chairperson.     And we would – if you are so inclined would – we would move for the order as has been proposed by the evidence leaders.     It does cover all the…     Yes Chairperson and given is nature or the nature of his – of his work within the agency.     Yes.   I think that is covered at paragraph 3 Chairperson of that.     We have just handed up to you.     Chair we had left that to the evidence leaders seeing that they would be the one to notify as the rules require that they would notify anyone implicated.  We do not address the issue of implicated persons but we believe that should there be a need for the implicated persons to – would like to cross-examine Mr Y they would follow the procedure outlined in the rules and that logistical issues can be dealt with between them and the evidence leaders but for the purposes of that I think that could also be addressed by the – by the Y application.     Yes.     Chairperson we would happy as well.     Yes.     Thank you Chairperson.     Will do so Chairperson.     Thank you.

MS DLAMINI:  Nokunqoba Gloria Dlamini.    No I do not have any objections.    Yes I do.    So help me God.    I am employed by State Security Agency based in Pretoria Head Office.    Yes.    Raise it okay.    I will do that.    I am an analyst and evaluator.    It means I interpret and analyse report from the information obtained from the vetting field work.    Very much thank you.    Yes I have been assigned a role of a Project Manager when the vetting of executives of SAA was undertaken.    You mean in terms of the skills?    Or the [indistinct].   Okay.  As the Project Manager I was responsible to outline the project overview, define the objectives of that project, make sure that we are within the scope and then outline the budget for the project.  The milestones, make sure the responsibilities of personnel within the project – the project team are clearly defined and also to ensure the communication lines between us and the client are clear and then also make sure there is resources and facilities for the team.    I have been amongst the team who were on projects within the organisation prior to my appointment.    Yes.  Yes, yes.    This was my first appointment.    Yes, yes.  I was responsible to manage the project of Government Printing Works as well.    I have got a Master’s Degree in Public Administration from the University of Pretoria, Senior Management Program from University of Pretoria.  I also hold a Project Management – Practical Project Management course from UNISA Business School.  New Managers Program from WITS and Security Advising Course.    I have been with the agency for the past 16 years.    Yes, yes very much.    On the affidavit?    Page 6, yes.    Yes there were engagements between the two Ministers, former Minister of Finance, Honourable Nene and our former Minister, Honourable Mahlobo.  I was not privy of those conversations or meetings but they are attached correspondence to that as they engage on the need and the decision that the executives of SAA must be vetted.    Yes, yes.    I think this is the letter from the Minister of State Security then Honourable Mahlobo to Mr – to Minister Nene at a time.   Yes that is correct.    No, no, no. I did not see it at the time.    No I saw the letter that was attached to the list of officials and executives that were to undergo the vetting.    Where are you now?   Yes.    13 October 2015.    Yes.    I got to see the letter that was attached to the list.    No.    No.    Yes I got aware of the letter but I cannot have the exact date.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes, yes, yes.     “It has come to the attention of the State Security Agency that there is an urgent need for vetting and re-vetting of state owned enterprises giving sensitive information received on an ongoing basis.” And I think that is the part that was also indicated on the letter wherethe list of executives and support staff that I received.    He is indicating the need to vet the officials at SOE because of the huge impact that the – okay let me start again.  He is – “SOE’s as government entities have a huge impact on the economy of the country and therefore extremely important for state security to conduct vetting as per the mandate of SSA.”     “As per Section 1 of the National StrategicIntelligence Act 39 of 1994 as amended by Act 67 of 02 states that the National Intelligence Agency has the mandate to vet all other National, Provincial and Local Government Departments, Parastatals and their service providers.”    I am – come again?    I am aware that in terms of the strategic objectives of counter intelligence it is the main objective is to ensure that corruption in state owned entities is reduced.    Yes.  Yes.  I do.    Yes.  It states that vetting should be conducted to persons who are employed by the State or who are to render services to the State and have access to classified information or the National Key Points.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    (No audible reply).    Yes.  Yes.    It - it - on this paragraph …    It is not clearly stated that these employees are employed by the State - by - by SOEs.    Yes.    Okay.    I think …    Yes.    No.  No.    No.    I did not pick it up.    I have to be honest.    I am not aware.  I am not aware.    No.  I am not aware.  I am aware that it is Section 2A.    It is Section 2A that covers …    The mandate …    To vet the employees of the State Owned Entities.    No.  It does not say.    Ja.    Yes.  I do.  Yes.  I see that.    Yes.  It is - it is quite specific …    To say it is - it is the individuals who are employed by the State or those that are to render service to the State and have access to National Key Points or classified information.    I do have a part on the legislation.    Yes.    No.  No.    No.    Yes.  Yes.    Aviation Legislation Reference Bundle.    3-6-1.    Yes.  Yes.  I am - I am there.   Yes.  Yes.  That is the one.    Yes.  That is the one.    Yes.    Captured.   Okay.  Yes.  That is the one.    Yes.  I see Section 2A - capital A Advocate Hofmeyr.    “When performing any function referred to …”    Oh.  Yes.  Yes.  Sorry.    Yes.    You mean just the A - just the A?    Okay. “The relevant member of the National Intelligence Structure may conduct a vetting investigation in the prescribed manner to determine the security competence of a person if such a person is employed by or is an applicant to an organ of State or is rendering a service or has given notice of intention to render a service to an organ of State which service may give him or her access to classified information and intelligence in possession of the organ of State or give him or her access to areas designated National Key Points in terms of the National Key Point Act 1990 Act 102 of 1980.”    Yes.  Yes.  “This should be understood from the background of challenges affecting most of the State Owned Entities.”    Companies.  Yes.    “The Chairperson (SAA) will be required to provide a list of all Executive Management and support staff.”    As I have indicated before I did not see this letter priorto my responsibilities.    Yes.    In the course of the responsibilities.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.  Yes and the letter that I saw first.    Yes.    My understanding is that the Executives of SAA are employed by a State Owned Entity and in terms of our mandate theyhave to be vetted.    I - we - I engaged with my Executive Boss at the time … (intervenes).    General Dlodlo.  Yes.    Yes.    That is correct, because they were working for a State Owned Entity in terms of the law …    And in terms of our mandate … (intervenes).    In terms of Section 2A that is one of the requirements and if they have - access to classified information or they have access to a National Key Point …    But I would go with the first one where it says   Yes.  Very much so.  Yes.    It - it could be, but …    It - it is required, but being employed by a state institution on its own it is enough.   Yes.    Yes.  I do see that.    I do not regard it as the only requirement, but I am saying by virtue of being employed you have to be vetted by a - employed in a State Owned Entity.  Also if you have got access to classified information.  So I do agree with him to a certain extent.    No.  That is not right.   I am saying you have to be employed as per Section 2A as it states that if you are employed by a - an organ of State you have to be vetted.    That is the first part.    Yes and then the second part states that if you have got access to classified information or access to a National Key Point you have to be vetted.    It - it could be a combination of the two.  You can be employed and not have access to classified information.    And you still need to be vetted.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    I am …    Yes.  Chairperson, I am saying if you are employed by an organ of State you should be vetted.    It is compulsory.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  I see that.    Can you come again please?    If we look at the law it - it states that if you areemployed by the State you have to be vetted and at least - or if you are rendering a service to a State Organisation and you - you have access to classified information.  You have to be vetted.    Yes.    Yes.    Let me not talk for the rest …    Of the people.  Ja.   Ja.    Yes.  Yes.  We do.  Yes.  We do.    Very much.  Very much.  Yes.    3.2?    After the exchanges then the list was forwarded to our Ministry at the time - Honourable Mahlobo - and then it had to be directed to the relevant structure …    From his office.  Yes.    It was the list - it was as we received it.  It said Executive and support staff.    I was not there when the list was compiled, but when the - we received the list it was written Executive and support staff.    I received it from my Executive and then it was from our Ministry.    Page?    Yes.    This is the letter that former Minister Nene wrote to our former Honourable Mahlobo.    I think it is 26 November 2015.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.  Yes.    The National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994?    Yes.    He quotes it in the terms of saying these Executiveshave access to sensitive information.    Yes.    That we have resolved.  Yes.    Yes.    This is the letter that I was talking about where the list was attached.  Yes.    Yes.    This is the list now of the Executives that were to undergo a vetting assessment.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    It is the list of Executive Members that are going to be vetted.  That is correct.    On the front top part it is 13 names …    And then you would proceed with the whole list of names.    I am saying because it - it starts from this page …    And then there is the list that continues when you look at 22, 23, 24, 25 m…   26, 27, 28, yes.  Yes.    Yes.  That is correct.    It is the letter that was written to former Minister Nene from the former Chairperson of SAA - Ms Myeni.    That is the - yes.  It is - it is 5 November 2015.  Yes.    This is the list that I was referring to.    Increased in what sense?    When I received this it was the entire document.  So I would not separate the 13 names to the rest of the names.  So I - I didnot separate it.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    No.  Not at the time, but as soon they were submitting the forms that they had filled.  We - I was able to - to - to make that distinction.    What do you mean?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    When I looked at the list I looked at it in total.    No.  No.  Ja.  I looked …    At it in total.    So the first 13 and the rest of the names to me it was just a list of the people - the officials that had to be vetted at the time.     I was not given reasons and I wasn’t there when the two ministers were engaging on that, so I wouldn’t know whose decision it was.     Not at the time no.     No.     My answer would yes, the Board would have to be vetted, but remember Advocate Hofmeyr the Board is vetted in terms of their contracts, do their contracts cater for that or if it is a request from the President.     According to the MISS ...[intervenes]      It is Minimum Information Security Standard, Chapter 5 we vet the Board if there is a request to vet them.     Yes.     Or rendering a service.     To classified information yes.     Yes.     Yes.  So they should be vetted on that note.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes and considering the Section 2A.     No.     I didn’t think about it at the time.     I will have to think about it.     No she is asking me if the Ministers were engaged in terms of the Board having to be vetted, I am saying no one engaged with those ministers at that time.     Yes.     No at that time I didn’t think about it.     Yes, yes, yes.     No, I would not know, I would not Chairperson, I wouldn’t.     Yes, yes, it would ...[intervenes]     It would make sense yes.     No, no, we did not.     465?     Yes, yes I do.     Yes, yes, yes.     Yes.     Absolutely, absolutely.     They are not full members who are employed by SAA.     No they are not.     Yes.     You must be vetted.    That’s correct yes.     It was because the Executives who were vetted are employees of SAA.     I see that.     Yes.    No they were not.     No, no it was not on this, it was on Section 2A.     Yes, that is correct Advocate Hofmeyr.     Yes that is correct.     Yes Advocate Hofmeyr, it is the project plan that I designed.    Yes.     Yes.      “The main goal of the project is for SSA to support the government of RSA in securing its sovereignty and protecting its integrity, through conducting vetting to all executive management and support staff at SAA, in a prescribed manner as mandated by theNational Intelligence Act as amended by Section 3 of the General Intelligence Amendment Act 11.”      “The objective is to ensure that all classified and sensitive documents within SSA are assessed by personnel with valid security clearances.”     Yes – yes that is an error.     That is correct.     I think in an ideal situation will be conducted prior to employment so that when you have access to classified information you – you have already gone through the background screening.     Our role was to identify the risk posed by the executives who are already employed at that entity and then advise the client, the entity accordingly      I get the question Chairperson but remember we started by saying officials who are employed by an organ of state need to undergo vetting, as per section 2(A) of the Law. Right?  Now those persons if they have access to classified information as part (B) now of Section 2(A), they have to be vetted so if you are employed by an organof state you have to be vetted.       Yes we did not access the job descriptions of the executives that I can say prior to vetting but the approach was to say at a strategic level as executives they have to be vetted.     Yes, that is correct, yes.     Okay let me come in there, in that, the reason that I have given to say the person, the officials who are employed by a State Owned Entity needs to undergo a vetting assessment.  In this case we are talking about executives that are already employed so we need to minimize the risk now to say this person, these people, this officials are alreadyemployed.     Why?     We would vet them because they are employed by a State Entity.     Yes Chairperson if I may elaborate to say flowing from the Section 2(a) of the law, considering that these officials were already employed by a State Owned Entity, that would be a big consideration for them to be vetted.     Yes     Chairperson if we were to refer to the letters between the two Ministers it states that these officials have access to sensitive information.  Maybe the question would be, did the two Ministers who engaged or communicated prior to the project being implemented, what was there, what exactly did they do to ensure that these people have access to sensitive information?    Yes, yes, the first one.     It is page 17.  It says, let me just refer, okay if you can go to 19 [intervenes].     Yes.     I do not know.     Yes.     I am just driving Chairperson the point that in the two Ministers who engaged prior to the project being implemented, it is stated on these letters to say these executives have access to sensitive information on an ongoing basis [intervenes].     Let me read paragraph 2.       It has come to the attention of the State Security Agency that there is an urgent need for vetting and re-vetting of the State Owned Enterprises given sensitive information received on an ongoing basis.  Now the question that Advocate Hofmeyr is posing in terms of access to sensitive information, I am saying I was not privy of what the two Ministers communicated on and if there was any reason or information shared relating to that access of sensitive information.       Yes     Yes to an extent that the two Ministers might have engaged with SAA to obtain, to have the reasons as to do these executives have access to classified information.     Yes, so it is known from that context, that is what I amtrying to explain.     Yes Chairperson but I would go with paragraph 2 to support.     About SAA     Yes.     Yes I do.     Yes I quickly want to check something.  Oh yes I think the later dated 2015, November 26 [intervenes].     Page 19 – page 19.    From former Mr Nene, I think the issue of sensitive information on an ongoing basis comes up again.     The issue of sensitive information received on an ongoing basis is coming up again.     Yes.     Yes. Yes. Yes.     Yes.     Where are you now?     Oh 35. Yes?     Yes I see that.     Yes I see that.     Yes.     Yes – yes –yes.     You mean, can you just elaborate a bit?     Yes.     Okay let me explain on that, in terms of the buy- in and the support, remember we had briefed the board when we rolled out the project but that did not mean that any issues arising from the time that we briefed them, I cannot raise them, and that did not mean that I do not have the buy-in.     In a sense because they were briefed, everybody was briefed and there were no, I did not get any indication to say they do not support what we have to do.     No, it was not.    Remember the executives who resigned would write their letters to their employer not to me.  It could be of different reasons but I had to engage on that to say could it be anything relating to the work that we are doing there.  So in terms of the support the board, the acting CEO at the time, there was never any indication to say they are not onboard.     Miss, Advocate Hofmeyr, you will recall that I would arrange the meeting so that we engage on any of the issues arising at that particular time and at no stage did any of the board members, any of the executive indicated to me or to the organization I represent to say they are unhappy or they are not going, there are any issues that need to be discussed.  I will be the one to engage them to say these are the, this is the situation where we are and provide status reporting in that regard, so in that sense I would say I was of the idea that I still have the buy-infrom them.     That is correct.     No.    Yes, and I have to indicate that I was stationed at Airways Park the whole time so I would engage the CEO at any given point, so Advocate Hofmeyr at no stage did the former Acting CEO indicated to me or to the organization to say there are issues or disturbing issues pertaining to the vetting of executives.     I was prepared to brief them at any given stage.     That was Mr Zwane at the time.      Yes, yes, yes.     Yes I do.     Yes I see that.     Yes, yes, I see that.     I had requested the meeting to meet the Chairperson of the board and from my side it was simply to observe protocol.  If she was present at the board meeting the next day I would have briefed her together with the board at the same time.  The very same project plan that was presented to her on the 13 t h was the very same project plan thatwas presented to the board in Midrand Protea Hotel on the 14 t h.  So from my side it was simply to observe protocol.     In Durban.     Yes.     Let me indicate that the board sitting on the 14 t h, I was not aware that the board is sitting on the 14 t h.  We got that information from the Chairperson herself to say look the board is sitting tomorrow in Midrand it would be easier for you to meet them there because she is in a position to know in terms of the schedule for the board.     Yes.    I think the dates- I just added the dates after it had occurred.    It was but I think that the date- those two dates I just put them as we went along.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   No, it is correct, it is 2016.    It is 2016.    Oh, you mean the second date.    I think the second date is wrong.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh 2015, yes.    You are correct, it is 2015.    Yes.   Yes.    That is right.    Yes, that is how it unfolded.    Page 8.  Yes.    Yes.    The purpose of the meeting was to present the project plan and to- and how it is going to be rolled out and also to request her to make available the necessary resources.  Such as parking, access card, polygraph suit, nodal point offices and then operational centre.      I was of the idea that whatever we have discussed with her and the board together they will be able to attend to it and get to us.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    The board sitting.    Yes.    Of course, but I was not aware when is the board meeting.    Yes.    Yes.    No.    She was not.    Ja.    We met the board, the board was down in Midrand on the 14 t h, yes.    Okay the ... (intervenes)    Yes, there are four stages that we follow in terms of the vetting exercise.  That is the administration stage, the vetting fieldwork stage, polygraph examination and the analysis stage which is the last part where the information is interpreted, analysed and a recommendation is done.  Okay, let me start with the administration stage.  The administration stage it is where an official will fill in a vetting form Z204 form, attach the required documentation and we will load that in oursystem and verify it, right.  Basically, that is it in terms of the administration.And then the vetting fieldwork stage now the file from the administration unit will move to the vetting unit.  That is where now the vetting officer who has been assigned that particular case would make the necessary arrangement to conduct interviews with the references that have been identified from the form and additional ones that she would go on to recruit, if I may use that word.  And then at this stage the vetting officer would after making those arrangements would go on the field to conduct the interviews and then he or she will combine a report.  And thatreport will be moved to the polygraph examiner.Now at that stage it is polygraph examination and let me also indicate that there are standard- there are guiding questions that the vetting officer uses or follows when they conduct those interviews.  But he or she can add any questions being guided by the person that he or she is vetting because each individuals vetting is different from another.  So, the information would be different.  So, the vetting officer would be- must probe further.  So those questions can be changed or there can be additional questions by the vetting officer.Now the polygraph stage which is the third stage.  Now that is where the polygraph examination will take place.      Are you following me?    Yes.  It is conducted to ... (intervenes)   Okay.  Now at this stage now the polygraph is to determine the reliability of information.  So, he or she conducts vetting of that particular official, compile a report.  He or she can refer the file back to the vetting officer or the file can move to the next stage, the analysis.And then the last stage is the analysis part where the information is consolidated, interpreted, analysed from the administration stage to the vetting stage to the polygraph stage.  So, this is the analyst now who is consolidating and interpreting all that information to make thefinal conclusions.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Quite extensive, yes, it is.    70?    Yes.   Financials yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is the next stage, yes.    That is correct.   Yes.    Yes.    They provide the base from which the questions are asked.    To probe further obviously.    Exactly.    Yes.  I am on page 43, yes.    Yes.    Oh yes.    Yes, I see that.    Yes, I do.    Yes, because the interview is quite personal.    Yes, it is quite personal.      So, I would say the entire questioning it is quite personal.    Yes.    From the questions that you have the questions is like, yes, it is asking that, yes ... (intervenes)    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    As I have said I think the entire ... (intervenes)    Yes.    Advocate Hofmeyr as I have said I think the entire ... (intervenes)    Interview is personal.    I know you want to pick up certain questions ... (intervenes)    Yes.    All the questions are personal.  I still ... (intervenes)    Yes, I see that.    Yes.    Yes.    No, they are not.    Yes.    I would not say that exactly but you would get the answers the responses depending on what the person have said.    I believe so.    Yes, I see that.    Yes, advocate Hofmeyr.    That entire interview is personal.   Just like I have said Advocate Hofmeyr, the entire interview, it is a personal interview.    Yes.    Yes, the answer is yes.    Because they were vetted at a Top-Secret level.    It is standard practice for senior management to be vetted at a Top-Secret Level.      Because the request stated that they are executives so they are vetted at a Top-Secret level.    Yes.   That is correct.    I noted that from the forms or the submissions that we got it was mainly the executives that submitted.    Yes.    As I am saying Advocate Hofmeyr from the submissions that we received it was the executives that submitted back the forms and the supporting documents.    No.    No.    It was only the executive managers, yes.    Yes.    Yes, I remember that request.    What would be the question?    Yes.    Oh yes.    You are quite correct.  I remember in the meeting that wehad you did indicate.  I was hoping I would have the copy of the questions just like you have gone through the vetting questioning.  We were hoping to provide you with those questions and then indicate what were the additional questions.  So, I think that can be provided.    Yes.    I think it was just a slip of the mind at the time.   Yes.    No, I have not.    Yes, I can do that.    Yes, that is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Not at all.    Because I know when it comes to the issue of the levels ofclearances.  The security managers will indicate in terms of the request to state that these particular persons should be vetted at this level, right.  But in this case from the request that we received from the entity it was not specified.  So, we just took the standard approach to say they will be vetted at a Top-Secret level.    Yes.    Yes.    Let me come back to that.  Let me come back to that.    You saying to me – ja.    I do not understand the question.    Yes can you repeat the question?    Yes.    Oh now I get the question and I have said Advocate Hofmeyr at SMS level we vet at the top secret clearance.    Senior Management.  Yes.    There is no rule somewhere.  At SMS level when we get the request it is indicated that this person must be vetted at this level.  But at this particular time the request that came did not indicate what level should they be vetted at.  But because it was stated that they have access to sensitive information we vetted them at the top secret clearance.    Yes.    Yes.    I am stating from the letters from the two Ministers.    Yes.    Sensitive information.    On the letter Chairperson it says; “Giving the sensitive information they receive on an ongoing basis.”    Yes.    That is easy.    No I was not present.    We have got a structure dedicated to doing that.   Yes.    No I was not present when the – the presentations were conducted.    No I did not find out.    No. No [mumbling].    The – I think the awareness presentations that were presented we will have to establish in terms of the details.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes of course.    Yes of course.    I would not tell.    I would not tell.   Yes.    Yes I see that.   Yes.    Yes, yes I did.    The fee – you mean the outcome?    Yes.  The outcome yes it was received by the acting CEO at the time, Mr Zwane, yes.    I did not get that feedback from him.  But from our side it was received by them.    Yes.    Yes Chairperson that is correct.    No. No.   Whether or not he passed it on I do not know.    He would be meant to pass it on.    Yes.    Yes.    No it was not in writing.    This was a verbal communication.    That is correct.    Yes.   Yes I would be surprised.    I would be surprised because there was never indication from our side to say or to approach us in terms of those outcomes.  So I was of the idea that the applicants did receive the feedback.    Yes.  Yes I am the one.    Yes.  Yes.    Remember we had received the list so I was able to track in terms of who has submitted and who has not submitted.  So judging from that I would tell how many numbers are still outstanding.    No.  No.    That is correct.    To address the challenges that I have highlighted in 3.10.  Because as stated they had a potential of tainting the integrity and prolonging the process.    Because then it will mean the officials that were on the list if they are not complying it means we were not going to be able toreach our targets and we are not going to complete the work that we were supposed to do.    To ensure that the executives as they refer to them, the top 100 are vetted.    They call themselves the top 100.    So I used that term.   You – I am just referring to the term that they would use, yes.    Yes I did.  Yes I did.    On the issue of – let me just go back.  Remember amongst the challenges – yes her indication would be they would try to assist any way – in any way possible.    No.  No.    Yes judging from the – the submissions.  Yes but in terms of the actual steps, no I was not.    No I do not know.    Yes.    I would prefer not to engage on that particular case because I have not had time to look at it.  I do not know what happened on that particular date.  So…    Yes.    Look it is – we are talking of more than 100 names thathad to be vetted.  So I think Advocate Hofmeyr to ask me on a particular case now…    Let me just say – can – maybe I pay attention to that because I am not a professional polygrapher so I think one would have to look what happened there.  I think that is what I can say for now.    No.  No.    No I do not.    Of course yes Chairperson.    There are standard questions.    That are asked at a polygraph examination.  Yes there are.    Let us look at about 7/8.    Let us look at about 7/8.    Yes.    Ja.    Those would be the standard – yes.    Exactly yes.    No I would not know.  I would not know.    But all I can say is each case is treated on merit.   On its own yes.    The standards questions are there Chairperson.    As guiding.    As the questions from vetting.    So the polygraph examiner concerned would treat thatcase on merit.    Yes.    Questions yes.    I think those are the questions that we gave to you.  Those are the questions I am referring to.    Standard ones.   Yes.    Standard ones.    Yes.    Can go further.    To ask more?    Yes.   No I – there is no limit.    There is no limit.    I am not aware.    I do not know.    I do not know.   Look I am trying to – to recall the questions now as you asking me.  So I do not want to say.    That is standard that is not.    Because then you going to say, I said it is standard.    And it does not come up you see.    Yes.    Do we have them here?    Page 43.  Are you talking about the vetting questions?    Oh not the polygraph questions?   No these are not polygraph questions.    Oh yes I thought you said the polygraph questions are here because I was going to go through it.    Yes.  Ja.   How?  Could you give me more time?    Alright ja.    No I cannot do it now.    Yes.    No Advocate Hofmeyr I will…   Advocate Hofmeyr I would – I am not in the position.    To obtain that information now.    I can provide it later.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes, yes.    For now?    Thank you Chairperson.    Yes.  Yes.  I do.    Yes.  Yes.    That is correct Advocate Meyr - Hofmeyr.    That is right.    Yes.    Yes.  This is the presentation I prepared.    Yes.    Yes.    I - it was forwarded to the office of our Ministry by myself.  Yes.    At S - at …    SAA?  No.  No.    The Board.    The Board.    Yes.    No.  I did not actually present it.    No.  I do not know.    Yes.    That is helpful.  Thank you.    Yes.    Absolutely.  Yes.    Okay.    5-3, oh.  Yes.    Yes.  I have that.    I see that.    Yes.    I am with you.  I am with you.    Yes.    Yes.  I see that.    It has never occurred Advocate Hofmeyr, but I was quite cautions, because with the SAA anything could have happened.  There are unions involved.  There might have been a - Executives that would approach the unions to state whatever reasons.  So that is why I had to indicate it there.    No.    Hm.    Of course, because in terms of the work that we were doing there it would be important not to put the entity under any undue stress.    So it - it comes from that thinking …   Chairperson.    Yes.    Hm.   We invited the Member of Parliament in 2015 and we experienced the - the union who cited that they were not happy with certain issues.  So that did have an impact in delaying the work.  So it was important for me to state that in this instance.    Yes.    Anything possible might have happened.    That - that is the thinking that I had …    Because if employees - any other person employed in a State organ who is not happy.  The first contact would be the unions and what happens after that the complaints, the - the strikes …    That is … (intervenes).    Yes.  Yes.   Ja.    Yes.    As I indicated before I had continuous engagement with the Acting CEO at the time and I did ask him to say since the inception of the project what has been the developments.  Are there any improvement or any other issue that must be - that we must take note of.  So it comes from - from that.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    He did not say “as a result”, but he said they have seen some shift - a positive shift in terms of the revenue … (intervenes).   Yes.  Yes.    I must say that I did not have access to the financials at that time …    But I know that it is individuals that manipulates thesystem.  It is individuals that are engaged in mismanagement of funds.  So any positive shift during that period I would say …    Hm.    Chairperson, can I explain please?    Can I explain?    No.    No.    No.  I am just saying there was a positive shift.  Maybe it should have been stated that way.    To say there was …    There was some revenue generation.    Yes.    Yes.   Page?    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    We never got to vet any other Executives within the N - NDT, but my thinking was that remember there was an indication from the former Chairperson that we must vet the pilots.  So my thinking was in terms of the work that we did there it was of high standard to an extent that there - there was a need for us to also vet the other group.    Huh-uh.    The fact that we were able to advice in terms of the risks.    On - in terms of the risks.    I think it is tabled on this report in terms of our findings and recommendations.    It is on page - just give me a second.  Just - just give me a second.    Because I swear that is where their findings and recommendations.  That is where I am trying to get to.    Yes.    Ja.  I think - ja.  I think maybe there is a …    There is slide.  Yes.  Yes.    Ja.  Ja.  I think there - there is a list inside.    Ja.   Because they - they should have been there.  Yes Chairperson …    Because that is what I was referring to.    Yes.  I think it is the mistake from the attachments.    That was supposed to be in.  Yes.    There were - there - there is a slide where we advise the client in terms of the risks identified.    Is it page 62?    No.  No.  It is not … (intervenes).    No.  During the - the course of the project.   Yes.  These were the risks …    But the final …    Yes.    Ja.  It is not here.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Let me think now.  They were indications of Executives who had - let me think.  Can I provide those please?  Can - can I get a chance to provide those?  I am thinking out of my head.  Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    I want to be more accurate …    In terms of what I had …   Tabled down.    Rather than talking from my head.    Yes.  I think it is - it is better that way.    No.    I understand it in a sense that I received a - an indication to say we are going to request that you vet the other - for instance the pilots.    Yes.  So it comes from that.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Very much.    Very much.    Ja.    Not specifically pilots … (intervenes).    Yes.  That was the request, but I am saying my thinking is because the team was above board in terms of our processes.  Interms of the work that we supposed to do there.  Judging by the fact that there were no issues that were raised with the organisation or myself during the period that we were there and then if now we get an indication to say can we extend …    To vet this.  So from my part it would say   That was my thinking.    It came from the former Chairperson of SAA.    Yes.    No.  We never got to deliberate on that …    Particular issue, because my focus was mainly on - on the work at hand.    Yes.    I am saying Chairperson in terms of the findings and recommendation they were supposed to be attached to this report.  They are not here today.    Yes.   Yes.    There …    I am saying as I know them, but it would be better to read from the - the document that …    Contains that.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.  Of course.    For example Chairperson we would advise SAA to revisit their recruitment strategy, because you would find that the Executivesthat are already in the system there was no clause in the contract to say they - they will have to undergo vetting.  Secondly, in terms of the measures such as taking an oath, declaration of - of secrecy such as - let me think.  Those were not undertaken when the people entered the system.    Yes.    That is the great success.    It means - by that I mean we have been able to influence policy.    Yes.    No.  No.    I believe Advocate Hofmeyr you are taking an approach that would be sort of ad hoc.    In this case there was a project in place …    And we had to do an investigative systematic approach to the individuals that are already at the strategic level.  So in that sense you are saying there was no need …    To the vet the officials.    I would have walked in there.  Check one, two, three …    And make findings which - I - I do not think … (intervenes).   Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    I do not agree with you, because now we are talking about the project that had to be undertaken.  So …    Let me just indicate …    Yes.    Chairperson that is why I said it would have been better to refer to the findings and recommendations here and … (intervenes).    Yes.    Yes Chairperson.    Yes.  I agree.    That …    Yes Chairperson.    You are correct, but that is the - not the only focus or the outcome … (intervenes).    Yes.    I see.    And let me also highlight that in terms of the strategic goals of vetting.  It is to ensure that corruption is reduced in a State Owned Entity.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes.    I think Advocate Hofmeyr what is happening now you are saying you are going through what I am saying and you are trying to say there was no need for vetting.    And I do not agree with her.    Okay.    I was explaining that in terms of the goal we had to make sure that corruption is reduced there.    In order for us to reach that goal we would highlight any other issue.  It can be small or big.  It can be small or big, but the main goal is to ensure that corruption is reduced there.     We have not vetted all of them Chairperson.     We have not vetted all of them Chairperson.     The magnitude of the work is too much.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Personal security vetting is the first point of ensuring that the people, the Executives that are there are men and women of integrity.     You have captured that correctly.     Because legally we are not covered in terms of that.     It means it is unclear as to say do you dismiss theperson, do you still keep the person in the entity.     I don’t think that is correct Advocate Hofmeyr, because as I have indicated before any risk that can be reduced at that particular time and in terms of advising on the measures that needs to be addressed by that particular institution it does make a difference.   Yes you cannot fire a person on the spot to say they must leave that particular organisation, but you would – we would have advised theentity to say one, two, three needs to be taken caution of.     At this point because the law does not cover that part we have not indicated that there should be a dismissal.     Especially Chairperson because there are Labour Relations issues relating to that.     Yes.     No we wouldn’t say they must dismiss them.     For instance we would advise on programs that need to be undertaken to deal with the issue.     Yes, yes Chairperson.     It would mean for instance you would have to give access to that particular individual to information that is not of high sensitivity.     Employed yes.     According to Section 2 ...[intervenes]      Yes.     I am moving in terms of Section 2A.     Yes, yes.    Which one?     Yes.      Yes.     Absolutely.     Absolutely, absolutely.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, fully, fully.     We agree on that Chairperson but I want to push you further to say ...[intervenes]      Can you repeat please?     Advocate Hofmeyr if I may say that, as per our mandate we vet an applicant, we vet a person who is to enter the system.  Now, on your point, you saying, you stating that it means that person who is an applicant to be an official in a State Owned Entity, should not be vetted. I think that is the sense I am getting to you unless they have classified [intervenes].      Yes.     My response Chairperson, Advocate Hofmeyr, would be, I would be vetting a person that is an applicant according to Section 2(A) who has not had a access to classified information as yet.     You agree with me Chairperson?     Yes.     Let us go again.     Yes.     My response Chairperson would be, conducting vetting on itself is to determine the security competence, so my answer is, you rather not conduct vetting at all because once you embark on conducting vetting you want to determine security competence.     Exactly. I agree Chairperson, yes.     Okay.     I would not state that myself because I was not privy to what occurred or transpired between the two Ministers.     We never obtained their job description, their daily duties, yes, I never obtained that.     I said I am not in a position to respond to that particular case because I do not know what happened there.     Yes.     Yes, during the vetting?     Look, any executive would resign, particularly from SAA South African Airways.     They never forwarded their resignation letters to State Security, so I am not in a position to say what was stated on those letters, so one would have to have a look at those letters and see what was their reasons to resign.     I would not say that Advocate Hofmeyr because I do not have the reasons why they resigned.  A person can resign today whether I am there or not, so yes it happened during the time that we were conducting vetting at an entity but them resigning, I never go to understand or see their resignation letters.    Yes.     It depends in terms of the areas where they are employed, what skills do they possess?  Were they an asset to that particular organisation?  So it could be a number of things so I cannot really say.       During the course of the vetting assessment exercise as per [intervenes].      Yes.     We never got to discuss what would be the way forward in terms of that?     Yes.     Advocate Hofmeyr let me start by congratulating you for complying with the vetting process.  I think you are the evidence leader today because you have complied with the process and thank you very much for that. In terms if what you just said now [intervenes].      Yes, we were, I was always available and the organisationis always open to engage with the leadership of SAA in terms of the work that has been done there, what needs to be done moving forward and at this stage we have never received any indication from their side to say this is the work that has been done there, can we meet and deliberate on that?  So I think it will be very much unethical to say an organisation that is mandated to execute those responsibilities and state security had invested a lot of resources on this particular project because we had to execute it according to our mandate, I think it will be really unfair to state that.     Yes.     I do not accept it.     Yes.     I am not aware of those facts.     I think I am hearing it for the first time Advocate Hofmeyr and one would have to really think about that, ya.     I am not aware of any of the instances that you outliningtoday, so I am not in a position really to comment on that.     Advocate Hofmeyr look, now you are drawing me to the issues of SAA between the Chairperson of SAA and the other executiveswhich I think really is not fair to me because I am hearing what you are saying for the first time.  My job and my duties was to ensure that we execute the mandate of the organisation and I have done that to the best of my ability to represent state security.  What I can say, we were above board in terms of our processes, in terms of the work, in terms of the team that was deployed at SAA at that time.  We had highly skilled individuals on the project.  The polygraph examiners, we had three polygraph examiners.     Yes – yes.     In terms of that yes.     You are correct, but what I am trying to explain is to say [intervenes].      Yes.    Thank you very much Chairperson for clarifying that, I think I understand what you saying now.  Yes.    I think, my apologies because I thought at first [intervenes].     I think it would be very improper to do that, ya.     No I do not accept that.     I hope not.     Thank you very much Chairperson.    Thank you Advocate Hofmeyr.     Okay. 
S DLAMINI:  Hm.  Hm.  No.  I think I must acknowledge the mistake from my part … 
MS D DLAMINI:   Yes.     Yes.      Yes, yes.     No.     I think, I think, I think ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Thank you very much for that.     363.  Yes I am with you.     Yes I agree that security competency is mainly to ensure that information does not land into unauthorised hands.     Yes.     No Advocate Hofmeyr, I am not of the same thinking as you.     I would want to stick to Section ...[intervenes]      Let me just stick to my meaning.     I think it is safe for me to say.     I’m with you yes.     Yes.        Yes.      I’m sure you would provide me with a – the information that informs what you say.     No, no, no.     Yes.     With all due respect Chair I don’t agree.     On a note that as per the Section 2A if you are employed you have to be vetted.     Competence yes sir.     Yes.     Yes.     Not all the time.     Not all the time yes.     It could be.     I think then the debate will go on to say Chairperson if you say it is information that must be stored somewhere, because that is the sense I am having ...[intervenes]      I think Chairperson it means one would have to have a discussion or deliberate to say is this classified, is this not, because that on its own if one would say this document is classified the question is what informs you to say it is classified?     To make it classified.     Yes.     But then Chairperson in order to ensure that one might argue to say we lock it away but ...[intervenes]      Yes, but what happens is what happens if you areworking on classified information and somebody walks in.     Yes but it will depend on the behaviour ...[intervenes]      But does it happen like that?  That’s another question to say do people do that.     I am saying Chairperson if I were to state to you that it is not always the case.     Yes, yes, it is supposed to be the case.     Mmm.     Yes Chairperson but ...[intervenes]      Ja, but it is not always the case that the people that works with that classified information safeguard it and make sure that it is where it is supposed to be. 
ADV MICHAEL MBIKIWA:   Good afternoon Chair.     At long last.     Chair can I begin by asking that the file containing Mr Y's [intervenes].     Indeed Chair.     That is correct Chair, thank you.     Thank you Chair.  Can we just start with a sound check Chair?  Mr Y are you able to hear me?     Mr Y in front of you there should be a file marked DD(23), do you have that?     Can I ask you to open that file and go to page 1?  If you look at the red numbers in the top right-hand corner those are the page numbers that I will refer you to during the course of your evidence.     Do you recognise that document?     And that affidavit runs to page 22, sorry it runs to page 14.    Can you confirm that the contents of the affidavit are true and correct?     Thank you.  Mr Y can you tell us where you are employed?     And I am, I am, I am cautious not to ask you questions that will require you to reveal your identity but you will testify today about a range of facts that relate to a Special Operations Unit.    Can you tell us how you know about that unit?    Thank you Mr Y.  Before we get there, I would just like to understand before this change of mandate that you have described, tell us about what Special Operations was prior to thatdiversion.  And the kind of things that it did?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Y, you have referred on a few occasions to the High-Level Report.  I just want to flag that that is something we are going to come to in due course.    But can you tell us who the members of a unit like this would have been?  And I do not mean the identity of the members.  I just mean the level of specialisation and training that members of a unit like this would receive.    Thank you.  If we can pick it up at your affidavit at page 9.  That is in DD23.    And particularly from paragraph 3.4 you begin to talk about the diversion in the mandate of the Special Operations unit.    Can you tell us how this- the unit’s mandate was changed?    And how practically was this change in themandate of a Special Operations unit carried out?    And what position did Mr Dlomo hold?    And who would he have reported to in that position?    And can you give us a sense of the size of this unit?    And how would these members and agents have been recruited?    And were they formerly members of the State Security Agency?    And if you go to paragraph- sorry, to page 10 of your affidavit you deal with some of the functions that this unitperformed.      Can you talk us through those functions?    Mr Y, I am sorry to do this but can I interrupt you there.  Chair I am informed that there is a technical issue with the sound feed and to ask if we could adjourn for 5 minutes.    It seems to have been solved.     Thank you Chair.    Mr Y we left off with you explaining to us the functions that the Special Operations unit performed after the diversion of its mandate.  And you were telling us what parallel technical surveillance counter measures were, I believe.    If I could ask you to start at the beginning of where you were just in case it was not recorded?    And the- what you described earlier as VIP protection services, are those services that the State Security Agency would ordinarily perform?    Thank you.  I would like to then turn to your evidence in respect of the provision of protection services to Ms Myeni.  And we pick that up- sorry Chair, I see you reaching for the microphone.    Chair he did deal with the issue of recruitment and with the issue of the members from within SSA.  I asked him whether there were members within SSA.    I am grateful to you for the clarification of the 200.    He did not give the place.    You indicate in your affidavit where the agents were recruited from Mr Y.  Could you explain that?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Y, if we can then turn to page 11 of your affidavit.    Where you deal with the provision of security protection services to Ms Myeni.    Can you tell us how it came about that this unit provided such services to Ms Myeni?   Thank you.  You have referred again to the High-Level Review Panel and I think it is appropriate now that we go to that.  If I can ask you to turn to page 168 of your bundle.    You are there quicker than I am.  You will see there that on the cover page it says High-Level Review Panel Report on the State Security Agency December 2018.  And if you look in the footer it says, Report of the High-Level Review Panel on the SSA.    And that document you will see runs to page 273 in the bundle.    If you turn to page 173.  I just want to read these two paragraphs into the record Chair to give some context towhat this Panel was.    It says; The High-Level Review Panel into the State Security Agency SSA or Agency was established by President Cyril Ramaphosa in June 2018 began its work in July 2018 and was given 6 months to submit its report.   The key objective for the establishment of the Panel was to enable the reconstruction of a Professional National Intelligence Capability for South Africa that will respect and uphold the Constitution and therelevant legislative prescripts. The Panel was chaired by Dr Sydney Mufamadi and included 9 other members with a wide range of senior level experience and expertise in law, security study, civil society, academia, the intelligence and security community and other arms of government. The Panel was supported by a secretariat provided by the Agency.Mr Y, can I then ask you to turn to page 236 because that is the portion of this report that deals with Special Operations?    And you will see there at 9- paragraph 9.3.5 the heading is Special Operations.    It says; According to information provided to the Panel a SO unit (Special Operations Unit) was first setup in the then NIA in or around 1997. Was subsequently shutdown date not known and reopened again in or around 2002 and apparently carried over into the SSA.Does that accord with your understanding of the origins of this Special Operations Unit?    Indeed.  This is- in your evidence earlier what you described as the position prior to 2012.    In the second paragraph it says; The notion of the Special Operations unit in Intelligence, Military and Police services is not at all unusual.  Normally it entails units who works under deeper cover of the service and who work on particularly sensitive operations against particularly serious targets or issues and usually at a National level.  Members of such units are supposed to be highly trained and particularly competent.   In the case of NIA and SSA such a unit would be based at Head Office and work on National projects of particular seriousness that cannot be assigned to a provincial or other structure.    Again, is that part of what you have described as the legitimate mandate of a Special Operations Unit.    Can I then ask you to read the thirdparagraph?    Thank you.  Are you able to shed any light on that investigation referred to by the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence?    And if you turn over the page to page 237.  It says; The Panel was able to identify the key player in the politicisation of SO and the SSA in general.  The member is currently serving government in a senior capacity.  According to reports he was deployed to SSA by the then President via the Minister at the time to head up the Special Operations Chief Directorate.Are you able to shed any light on who is being referred to there?    Right.  Your- in terms of your evidence earlier was responsible for the diversion of the mandate of the unit.   I would like then to go to the paragraph starting with, it is clear.    It is clear to the Panel that the SSA SO unit especially under the watch of the member mentioned above was a law onto itself and directly served the political interest of the Executive.  It also undertook intelligence operations which were clearly unconstitutional and illegal.   Information made available to the Panel indicated that these operations included inter alia the training of undercover agents in VIP protection and assigning some of these to provide protection to the then President as well as to others who were not entitled to such protection such as the former chairperson of the South African Airways Board.Does that accord with your understanding of the- what youdescribed as the diversion of the mandate of the Special Operations Unit?    Indeed.  Can I then ask you to turn over to page 238 and just the last paragraph above Executive involvement in operations?    It says there;It is clear from the above information and other information available to the Panel that Special Operations had largely become a parallel intelligence structure serving a faction of the ruling party and in particular the personal political interest of the sitting President of the party and country. I will pause there.  Do you have any comment on that?    It then says; This is in direct breach of the Constitution, the white paper, the relevant legislation and plain good government intelligence functioning.  I will not ask for your opinion as to whether it breaches the law but would you agree that it is in breach of plain good government intelligence functioning?    I then Mr Y would like to address with youthe question of the protection services that were provided to Ms Myeni.  And for that purpose, I would like to go back to your affidavit and pick it up at page 12.    Sorry, in fact page 11 at paragraph 5.2.    Can you tell us if Ms Myeni wanted security protection?  What would have been the proper process to have followed?    And as far as you are aware was any such process undertaken?   Chair, I intend to move on to a slightly different topic and to deal with the affidavit of Mr Muntsami who was involved in security at South African Airways itself.  It might be an appropriate time to adjourn for the day and pick that up in the morning.    Chair, I think we should be fine starting normal time.    I do not anticipate that Mr Y’s evidence will too much longer. 
MR Y:   Yes I am.     I confirm that Chair.     I do have it.     Yes I am there.     I do, it is a affidavit deposed to by myself.     Correct.     I do confirm.     I am employed at the State Security Agency.     That is correct.     Well within the State Security Agency the knowledge about the Special Operations Unit [intervenes].      Okay Chair.       Correct Chair.      Thank you Chair I will.     The knowledge about the specific unit I am speaking about, would be knowledge that the Board membership would be aware of.     In a high-level review-panel report, mention is also made about the necessity of such a unit.  So that information would also be publicly available in the redacted version.     And generally a unit like that would deal with strategic projects which are normally very sensitive and would involve the utilization of undercover members of the State Security Agency.     That was the position until 2012 when the mandate of the structure was changed and it became more of an account intelligence, combination of VIP protection and support to the former President.  I do not know if I should go further and indicate who was appointed in charge at that stage?    Former President Zuma.    Right, as I alluded to you the High-Level Review Panel Report a structure like that will deal with very sensitive operations in which the links between the State Security Agency or government would need to be hidden and plausible deniability be provided.  So classically you would look at counter terrorism operations or transnational organised crime.   If I had to quantify the focus given within the intelligence community, we speak about between 80% to 90% of information being available through open source.  That would leave between 10% and 20% which would need convert means and of that 10% to 20% an even smaller portion wouldrelate to a structure like Special Operations.  Using undercover members as it is expensive depending where you are operating you have to make sure you comply with all the rules and regulations relating to business entities and so on.  That was the situation up until 2012.    Alright.    Well, they would be full members of the State Security Agency however they’re identities would be protected.  So, they would not declareto people- to the public that they are members of the State Security Agency.  However, they would share the same benefits in terms of salary, medical aid, pension benefits.   Maybe I must just draw distinction between what we refer to as undercover members and the difference within a crime intelligence environment.  We refer to agents that are not members of the State Security Agency and are normally recruited to provide us with information.  Whereas within the crime intelligence and Police undercover operations, a gent there refers to a member.  So, with regards to State Security Agency you would have full member being part of such a unit and in thecourse of their work they would interact with agents who are not members.    Okay.    Correct.    Well the immediate impact would have been that the undercover members who were part of that structure would have now been exposed to the protection detail of the former President Mr Zuma.  They would start doing parallel duties with structures like the Presidential Protection unit who are responsible for the protection of the President.  So already thefact that they are now being exposed to other members of the security cluster means that they can no longer go function in an undercover capacity.   The second approach would have been that they would no longer be working on medium to long-term operations.  But would be dealing with immediate tactical situations where they would deploy to work around the security of the President.  So, you looking at timeframes of between a month to three months versus investing in people that need to be in position for anything between three to 15 years for argument sake.    It happened with the appointment of Mr Thulani Dlomo as mentioned in paragraph 4.1 of my affidavit and all the members of the structure were informed that they were no longer going to be working on identified focus areas for instance transnational organised crime or counter terrorism.  But they would now be doing more risk assessment and security directly related to the President, Mr Zuma at the time.    He was appointed the General Manager of the new Special Operations unit in 2012.    Part of the change was the shifting of the Special Ops unit from one Deputy Director General responsible for domestic operations to a Deputy Director General responsible for counter intelligence operations.     It would be difficult because part of the challenge we faced with at the moment is that obviously although the structure was not undercover, they still- their operations were on a need-to-know basis.  So, the knowledge I have has also been required through certain investigations.  The structure ended up with approximately 30 members but altogether they would have deployed in excess of a 100.  So, you would have had 30 members and then the rest would have been agents deployed to do the same work.   They were recruited directly by the Special Operations structure.  Not the normal HR process that anyone else applying to State Security Agency.  They were identified and then the names were given through and indications were that, please appoint these members within the structure.    No, there was a handful of members- I would not like to give a specific number but it would be anything between five and 10 that were formerly members of the previous structure who were resurfaces and then were utilised to continue with their new activities.  And then the rest were new recruits that was sourced by Mr Dlomo himself.    Yes.    Alright.  You will see that in paragraph 4.4 I use the word parallel.  I think it is a trend that you will see because the structure actually duplicated functions that were either part of other units within State Security Agency or other stakeholder departments that we would work together with.   So, for instance you would have the TSCM which is Technical Surveillance Counter Measures which were brought together under thecommand of Mr Dlomo although the function actually resorted under another SSA structure.  They were dedicated to doing this function directly for the President.    I am here Chair.    Yes.    Alright.  So, the TSCM function which is the TechnicalSurveillance Counter Measure function was duplicated.  So, what you would have is we have a structure responsible for that which would provide services to government departments to make sure that meeting venues are clean in terms of interceptions.  But you then had the capacity created within Special Operations that only serviced the President wherever he would travel.   If you look further into the affidavit the unit took over functions related to other government departments.  One would be the South African Military Health Services who are responsible for toxicology.  The Police Service who are the only department with a mandate to do the physical protection but the special operation members were trained as VIP protectors.  If you look at the Defence Force and specifically the Air Force, Special Operations members were designated to guard the former President’s aeroplane.  So, all of these are functions that were either duplicated from within SSA or on behalf of other departments.     No, the mandate for that lies with the South African Police Services.  However, maybe just a caveat we would utilise VIP protectors to protect people within the State Security Agency, visitors from foreign intelligence services.  We would also allocate them one of our protectors.  But that would be on an agreement basis with the South African Police Service.  No members of Parliament, Ministers, all of their protection falls under specific units within the Police Service.   Chairperson ... (intervenes)    Yes 200.    Yes.   The lower number the 20 to 30 would be full members of the SSA.  The 200 I am referring to here are not members of the State Security Agency.    Yes.  In Police terms these would be classified as informers for lack of a better word.    Yes Chair.   Yes.  Most of the recruits were recruited from KwaZulu Natal.   I cannot give you factual reason for that Chair.    Other than to make certain assumptions and deductions given the support base of the people involved.    Yes, Chairperson they were actually provided training which is normally only reserved for members of the State Security Agency.      So, they were provided training in foreign countries and thosecountries would not know that these people are not full members of the State Security Agency.  And obviously there is sensitivity in terms of that aspect.  So, what you had was people who were not members of the Agency but however were highly trained as counter intelligence officers both in VIP protection, the gathering of intelligence and aspects like that.      Okay.    Yes.    Well Chair, I must honest we have found no paperwork that would indicate either a request or an instruction from within the Agency.  And the first indications that we got that this occurred was from the High-Level Review Panel Report where it mentions not only Ms Myeni but certain other political leaders.   Obviously as we have been involved in the investigations, we are aware that these agents, the group of the 200, were allocated to specific people who could be seen as being supporters of the- of former President Zuma who may have been facing certain difficulties.  And would not be eligible for official protection from the SAPS.   Okay Chair, I am there.    Correct.    Yes.    Alright.    Correct.    Yes correct.  This paragraph would refer to the, if I can say the legitimate mandate of the structure.  And it is true what is mentioned here.    Correct.   Correct.    Yes, correct Chair.    Right. The Panel probed relatively deeply and widely into the issue of SO.  Towards the end of its liberations it received a briefing from the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence on an investigation it is currently conducting into SO that it hopes to conclude by the end of the current financial year.   The Panel will make recommendations regarding this below.  For the purposes of this chapter of our report we highlight key elements of what was presented to the Panel on SO particularly in relation to the nakedpoliticisation of intelligence in recent years.    I am Chair, it was based on certain complaints that came from some of the agents that- their complaint was their salaries was stopped.  What they called salaries and they opened up complaints with the Office of the Inspector General.  In the course of interviewing those agents obviously the Inspector General’s office then became aware of the certain operations that were running that would have been unlawful.  As far as I know the report has not been finalised yet and it is running parallel with an investigation that is taking place into the same issues but from within SSA itself.    That is Mr Thulani Dlomo.    Correct.    Right, yes.    Correct.  I would just want to clarify the training of undercover agents.  The undercover there should not be seen as implying that these agents were members of the State Security Agency.    Yes.    I would agree with that.    Definitely.    Okay.    Alright.    The normal process would have been we have a function withinthe Agency called Security Advising.  You would have a security advisor allocated to a government department or state-owned entity and any request highlighting for instance that Ms Myeni thought her life was in danger could have been channelled via the advisor and the South African Police Services.   The SSAs mandate is in the area of counter intelligence so obviously one would have internally done an assessment to say for argument sake if there were certain criminal syndicates that were being targeted for neutralisation by the chairperson and they were unhappy with us.  And we picked up information like that we would compile and assessment provide it to the South African Police Service who would combine it with their mandate to determine is the threat of such a nature that she would need to have VIP protection.      No, it was not.
