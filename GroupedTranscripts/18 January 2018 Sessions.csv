CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.     Mr Pretorius?      Oh yes, there was some homework that was to be done for delivery after lunch, but we did not continue after lunch, yes.    Yes, no, no I am happy that you are here and I am very happy that you are very determined to make sure that this Commission is assisted and that the nation gets to know what you know.      Thank you very much.      Yes, yes, yes.    Is that on the bundle other than the one that we were using yesterday?    Oh yes okay I have got it.  Page?    584?   Thank you.      I have got it ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.      Yes.    Yes.    I am sorry.  The page on page 584.    The photocopy page that is next to the one that you have dealt with ...[intervenes]    Has got names.    Are those names, names of persons to whom payments were made?    Okay alright thank you.  And I see that it itself does not have a date.  Is it for the 18th February 2016 as reflected in the first page, or is on there for another date?    Okay, okay thank you.      Is that 586?    Yes.    Yes.   Oh okay.  So there might not be an "M" after four but that is, we are talking millions?    Thank you.    Ja.    Yes okay.    Is that your writing that appears on these pages from that book?    Okay alright thank you.      I am sorry, are you still at page 586?    Ohm 588?    Okay thank you.  January 20?    Yes okay, okay.   Ja you were telling me something about that page.    Just start afresh.    Does "recon" stand for?    Okay.  Received GLA?    And how do you pronounce it?      Okay.      Okay.      So that is AVT not AUT?    AVT standing for Andries van Tonder.    Okay yes.      Okay.    So the total at the bottom of that page is the balance, or what is it?    Is that the balance?    Oh okay.    Okay.      Okay.    Yes 600?    It that the one on the right hand side that you are looking at?    Yes.      Oh okay.      Yes.    Yes.    Ja.   Ja.    Ja okay.      On some of the pages of this Exhibit, these little pages from the black book, you will find two pages as is the case in page 600 – at page 600?    What it the relationship between those two pages when there are two of them?  Is the one page for the names of people to money was paid and the other a reconciliation, or what is the relationship, or is it just coincidental?    Oh okay, okay.  Okay thank you.  Yes you may continue.   Yes.    Yes.     That is the name that – there is a word that looks like Ishmael there?    Who was that?   Yes.    Oh he was one of the directors?    And what is his surname, or is that the surname?    Oh okay.      Ja I think it is in your statement here.    Okay so the page that we are looking at, at page 602 the page from the black book, depicts names of persons to whom certain amounts reflected on the page were given to Ishmael to distribute to them?    Is that correct?    Okay thank you.  And what appears at the bottom is it the total when you add up all of those amounts, or is it the balance in the safe?    Sorry?    Okay.    Okay alright.  Well if it was stacks you would [mic off] amount, just like that, but this is not in stacks.    Okay alright.  Okay you may proceed.    Yes because you do that, let us just make sure we complete the point to which your evidence in regard to these pages relates.  One of the questions was about, how many people were so to speak on the payroll of Bosasa, but now the payroll I am talking about it is not the one for employees.  In terms of the monthly bribes that was one of the questions.  Does this answer that, these pages or not really?   About fifty percent?    Okay.  I did not count, I do not know whether you counted, whether fifty percent would be more or less what number?  Did you have a chance to count, twenty?    Much more?    About forty?   So your estimates, would your estimate be that at least at some stage while you were with Bosasa, people who were paid cash monthly may well have been around eighty or thereabouts?    Close ja.    Ja, ja.  It is an estimate, but you say eighty might just be around the correct figure?    Ja that received cash payments.    Yes.  Okay that was the one question, so that qualifies it.  The other question, I did not write them down.  The other question, do you remember, I am trying to see which ones we have been able to answer?   Oh.    I think Mr Pretorius did, at least my questions.  Mr Pretorius are you able to remind me what I had asked?    Oh I the other question may well have been – oh no it was the one about how much the cash was.   Ja that was answered.  What I did not ask which I can ask while Mr Pretorius is looking – oh I did ask.  I also asked about other gifts.    Ja the irregular gifts that may have been – I think you clarified that they may not have been given monthly like cash.    But there was a certain amount of irregularity, is that right?    But what I do not know whether I asked was, whether you would have an idea about what those would be in terms of monetary value per month, per two months, per year, apart from the monthly cash payments.  Is that – I do not know if I asked that.  Is that something that is easy to say, or you would need to check?    Ja.   Yes.  Okay let us ...[intervenes]    Yes.    For a period ja I think that is what I ...[intervenes]    Oh yes, yes, yes, yes.    Yes.    Ja, ja.  Ja in terms of how regularly Mr Watson's safe was filled, you did indicate it.    You said weekly, sometimes even quicker than that and in terms of the number of people or in terms of cash payments monthly, we now have an idea.  And in terms of other benefits, I think that might still have to be checked.  But that can come later, it is not urgent.    Yes.    Issues okay.    Yes.  No that is fine that is fine.  Okay thank you Mr Agrizzi.  Mr Pretorius you may continue.    Oh you wanted to raise, yes.    Please.    Yes please do so.      Yes, yes.    Yes.  So before they would be disposed of as you say.    Would there be a certain period during which they would be discredited, or the discrediting would happen after?    Okay, okay.  Well that may tie in maybe with a term that you used also when you were talking about that.  I cannot remember whether you used the term "terminate people".  But I remember you used a term and I in response I asked you to explain, because I said, you know under apartheid you know sometimes the term taken out was used.    And it had a certain meaning.  In terms of the terminology that youused, you did not mean that people would be killed, or did you?    Yes okay.    Ja you just meant that they would be got rid of from the company?    Yes okay thank you.  Thank you.    So that was your way of making sure that whatever you did was with his approval?   Yes thank you.      And is it possible ...[intervenes]    Is it possible that he really did not care much in terms of what was going out obviously to a certain extent?  In other words, maybe if my company's moneywas been paid, I would want to know that all the money that has been paid is money that are intend to be paid that it goes to the people that I intend it to go to.  But I do not know, maybe if there is just too money lying around, too much money you might end up, you know – I mean, you told us the other day R6 million per month was just a drop in the ocean.    So maybe that might have been the reason why he might have been as careful as somebody else might have been in terms of making sure what money goes out and the full extent.  Is that something that you think is possible?    Earlier on I thought you said R7, but I think you are saying R70 000.    So now it is R70 000 in this statement here.  What was the ...[intervenes]    I am sorry.  Was he shown that there was such a lot of money in a refuge bag?    It was not a big deal?   Ja [laughter] okay alright.      Ja.    Ja, ja.      I guess that must have been impart, because Mr Gavin Watson did not sign anything?    Ja.    Now the person mentioned there, who was he employed by or what was the connection between – what was the relationship between him and Bosasa?    Yes.  So was he somebody from the company that awarded that contract?    Ja okay, but he was not an employee of Bosasa?    Sorry?    Oh ja okay.  Thank you.  So did you view the servicing of his motor vehicle as part of Bosasa's bribery to people that would make it easy for Bosasa to get contracts?   That is how you viewed it?    Yes.    Yes okay thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius to interrupt you.  The name at paragraph 12.2 has not been mentioned.  So when you read the transcript you would have to look for this bundle to see what was that name.      Is there a particular reason that it is not being mentioned?    Oh okay.    Okay.      Oh okay thank you, okay.     And would the company that is chosen, would the company know about the fictitious invoice or not really, or sometimes they would know, or sometimes they would not know?    Okay, okay.    Yes.    This is after you had left Bosasa?    Yes.    Thank you.    Thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.    So the creation of these companies was really solely to facilitate fictitious invoices, basically the corruption?    Yes.    Thank you.  And there were a number of them that were created and then liquidated after sometime during your time at Bosasa?    But the number?    Okay, okay.  And are you able to tell whether they would have more or less the same lifespan before they got liquidated, or it really differed from one to another?    Yes okay alright.  But would that be maybe one or two where – in regard to which you are able to say, well maybe after it was created it was around for a year or two or anything like that?   Ja.    Okay.  No, no it is not so important, but it is information that might be helpful just to complete the picture.  Ja okay alright thank you.    Yes.  If you do not come back to me with it, it will not be a big deal, but if you are able to come with it, it is fine.   Oh, information being, what would be the lifespan on average of those companies that were created for basically corruption purposes that would be liquidated later.  Thank you.    [Laughter] thank you.    And was never delivered?    Yes.    Ja, ja, ja.    And then – I am sorry.  Do I understand correctly, are you saying that the order, I mean you have told me that there would be no liquor delivered.  The order would be for liquor to the amount of R4 million?    Okay.  Yes okay alright continue.  So I just wanted to understand that part, because I would imagine it would catch anybody's eye just the mere fact that it is liquor and it is for so much, but you will continue, you may continue.   It is not ...[intervenes]    Oh okay.    Oh okay.    Yes.    Oh that is still ...[intervenes]    That is still quite high I would imagine.    Ja.    Phone call from who to whom?    Yes.    So just to make sure I understand.  You are saying that it would happen that various orders for liquor as it would appear, were made by Bosasa to Jumbo Liquor Wholesalers?    And that the amount could be R1 million, it could – for any particular order could be another amount.  But over a week it could easily be about R4 million, is that right, more or less?    Ja.   Maybe a week or two weeks yes.  And then you say that one; no liquor would be delivered?    Two; cash would then be made available at a certain stage that would correspond with the invoice?    And that cash would be paid to somebody from Jumbo Liquor Wholesalers, or to Mr Watson.  Who would it be given to in terms of the procedure?   Oh it never – the cash never physically left Bosasa to go to Jumbo Liquor Wholesalers?    Oh.    Yes, yes.    Oh okay alright.    Ja.  And then you say, there would be a person from Jumbo Liquor Wholesalers who would then get in effect some commission?   Ja and the commission would be about 5 percent of 7.5 percent according to your statement, is that right?    Okay thank you.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay, okay, no thank you.      Thank you.    Yes.    Oh yes.    Oh okay.      The scheme means that in the case of Jumbo Liquor Wholesalers,in terms of their books they would be shown to have received certain amounts of money for liquor.    That they sold when in fact there was no liquor that they sold.    Yes thank you.    To pay the benefits.    So but those two cheques remained cheques from Bosasa as opposed from Metropolitan?    So when the Metropolitan one came it would just refund Bosasa is that right?    Yes but the point of what was happening is that two cheques were made and the books would reflect that they all went to the employee or his family butactually only one went there is that right.    Thank you, and the other one was used for briberies?    Okay thank you.    What was Bosasa's total number of employees at any one stage or maybe towards the end of your time there, more or less?    Oh okay.    Ja okay.    Okay.    By the time you left Bosasa was that still happening or had thatterminated?    So it was still – it was still happening at that time.    Yes okay, alright thank you.    No they did not.  Probably not.    Yes.    You just do the best you can.   Yes.    Okay we will take the short adjournment, tea break, and we will    Yes Mr Pretorius?    Yes.    SARS ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja okay.    Yes.    Okay thank you, thank you.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja well I must just say that I have seen in parts of your statement, your affidavit that is before me, where you have indicated that you can give more details and more information.  I have no doubt that the legal team and investigators of the Commission will pursue that to see what can be made out of that information.  So all information that you may have that is relevant to what we are doing, we want to know, thank you.    Thank you very much.  Thank you.    Chair one of the mechanisms used was to – if a client approached, especially with the youth centres, if they approached for assistance as they put it, with elections or with electioneering, they would approach us and normally the youth centre management would come to me and say look X, person X has approached us and they would like – they need X amount and they are prepared to pay for software or a fence or whatever that needs to be provided.  So basically we would supplysoftware programmes.  Now these software programmes actually did not cost anything because they had been done already.  So it would be invoiced as a software programme and let us just say for example the programme would be invoiced out properly as the relevant documentation.    You talk about – you refer to electioneering did I hear correctly?    Ja, are you talking about certain elections in certain parties, political parties?  Are you talking about elections, county elections like we are going to have and like we had in 2014 or what are you talking about?    That would relate to a particular party or ...[intervenes]?    Okay, and would this happen with a particular political party or would it happen with different political parties?    And it happened on a particular occasion not, it happened over time?    Yes.    Well is that something that is still coming up or is that ...[intervenes].    Ja okay, do you ...[intervenes].    Ja, do you want to do that?    Okay.    Ja, yes.    And the department, I think you said of social services you are talking about is it a Government – the Government Department of Social Services or is it some unit or department in a company?    Okay thank you.    Ja.    Would the MEC that you are talking about, that was present, would it have been a MEC responsible to the extent that Provincial Government might have this, I am not sure, for social services, as you understood?    Okay thank you.    Was Mr Dlamini from the Youth Centre of Bosasa or not?    Oh okay, okay thank you.    Yes, and what is the political party?    What is your answer to my question?    Thank you.    I do not know whether you have finished on this, have you or have you not?    Okay.    Okay let me ask, now this transaction that you have just given evidence about.    Did you say it took place about five years ago or are you not able to remember the year?    Get the information yes.    Yes okay.    Yes, yes.   Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes okay.  Now the election as I understand you, and you must just tell me if I misunderstood you, the election in connection with which this money was requested was to be in the North West and your understanding was that it was a regional election but when you say regional I do not know whether you meanprovincial or you mean something of less than the province or local Government or you are not sure?    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes but in effect was, as you understood the purpose of this money, was it to help somebody or a political party in their election campaign or in his or her election campaign.  Is that, was that your understanding?    Yes okay, alright, thank you.    So somebody within the relevant Government department would have known the true nature of this transaction is that correct?    So somebody within the relevant Government department would be party to the payment of taxpayers' money to Bosasa for non-existent programmes so that Bosasa could then pay the money or part of the money to somebody or a political party to support their election campaign, that is the bottom – that is what happened, what is happening?    That is what – yes.    Yes.   Well what I want to try and understand is whether the person or persons from the relevant Government department who would authorise the payment of money to Bosasa for this transaction, whether they are – they knew or are likely tohave known that really there is no, there is nothing to pay for, it is just to facilitate a certain transaction.  You might not be able to answer that.    Yes, ja.    Ja okay, thank you.    I am sorry, of course if you did what you just said you – if you were to do in my car, take out a navigator and later put it back, if I paid you I would know that I am not getting any value.    Ja.    Ja okay, thank you.   So there is a room that somebody's explanation might be I thought we got value, I thought we were paying for something that is of value but maybe it turns out I was mistaken or something?    Okay.    Mr Pretorius did we cover, when Mr Agrizzi was dealing with this transaction that entailed him going to a stadium in North West, did we cover the question of what amount was involved?  I do not seem to have picked that up.  If we have not maybe he can assist us in that transaction.    Okay.    Okay thank you.   Ja.    Okay thank you.    Thank you.    Ja, no, you may continue thank you.    But would you be able to say whether it was there for most of your time at Bosasa or for less than half the time you were there?    I think he is still on casual wages, is that right?    Ja.    Yes, ja.   Yes.    Ja.    No, no that is fine.    No, for a short time is it not?    2003, 2004.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.   Yes, but maybe it would suffice if you are able to say something like I am not sure but it may have gone on for about six months or a year or two years or five years.    So what would be your estimate in terms of that?    About six months?    Early in the 2000s, mid 2000s?    There about, ja okay, alright.    Ja.  Okay.    Was the principle used here basically the same principle that was used for transactions with Jumbo Wholesalers.  Liquor wholesalers.    It was the same principle.  Just a change of entities involved in terms of the supplier.  The supplier in quotes..    Okay.    Were the amounts more or less the same as the amounts that you were talking about in regard to Jumbo Liquor Wholesalers?    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    There will be a time when the names can be – You can deal with the names. Ja.  Okay.    Yes Mr Agrizzi.    So the difference between this method and the other ones we have had is that in this case, Bosasa would get a little bit of something, but would pay much more.    Ja.  Okay.    Piet Venter’s statement ja.  Okay thank you.    Yes.   Yes.    Okay.    That is fine.    You say he should go to – I am sorry.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   266.    Ja.    In Gauteng.    Ja.    Yes it is.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at    Before we proceed, Mr Pretorius, I just want to announce that I have just issued a media statement that is being sent out right now in regard to the position of the Secretary of the Commission.  Thank you.  Let us proceed.    Mr Pretorius, just remind me of the page where that affidavit is.    Yes.  Thank you.    Wait Mr Pretorius.  Just to make sure.  The affidavit you talking about, starts at page 252.  Is that right?    263 is where it ends.    Okay.    Yes and these are payments of legal costs paid by Bosasa in favour of Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng.  Is that – The documentation you have attached, reflects that.    Okay.  Thank you.    Thank you.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius.    Mr Agrizzi, you say it was a regular occurrence.  Is that the purchasing of property for Ms Lindie Gouws.  Is that would you say that was a regular occurrence or is it something else?   Okay.  Thank you.    Ja that is fine ja.    What would be – would you be able to make your own layperson's estimate of what it is true, the value might have been at the time you were shown?    Yes and you think this one might have been ...[intervenes]    Ja.    No that is fine.    Ja.  No that is fine.      Do you want to elaborate?    Ja, ja.    Ja okay.      Thank you.    Thank you.    Well if he says he does not want to comment, I think he does not want to say whether true or false.    Did you earlier on, or yesterday say his was R110 000 per month, or you cannot remember?    Thank you.    Mr Pretorius.    I think if I heard you correctly, in relation to the first line ofparagraph 20 you said that the person that was being confronted was Mr Gavin Watson.  It seems to me that the context of that paragraph it probably was not him.  Is it not the person whose estate is said to have been sequestrated that they are talking about that was being confronted?    Yes you said Mr Watson.    Ja.    Was it not one of those that you told me about earlier which were specially created only to be liquidated later?    Oh this was different?    Okay thank you.      I am not sure Mr Pretorius whether that deals adequately with the purpose of your question.    Okay.  Maybe I should just allow you to ...[intervenes].    I thought that you were giving Mr Agrizzi the opportunity to say why it is improbable maybe why he would – why it would be wrong to say he had compelled Mr Venter and I thought maybe the answer that he gave might not really cover everything.    Maybe just repeat the question and I listen his answer again carefully and then maybe I can articulate myself better as well.    As far as you know to the extent that it may be alleged that you compelled him, do you know what it is that you have feared would happen to him from you if he did not comply?    You are not aware of anything that he might have feared from you.    Is my recollection correct that this is the same person who had approached you earlier on and indicated that he wanted to join the group that was going to blow the whistle and did write a statement but change his mind at some stage or was there somebody else.    And did you say that – did you deal with where that statement wasmaybe – maybe I should say incomplete statement, was that taken away by him or is it under the control of somebody that you know?    Well I am talking about the one that was not completed.    That is the one I am talking about.  You say you do not know where that one is.    That one.  Did you ever have a chance to read it before he stopped with writing it?    Well the question I want to ask you if you did read it is whether there is any features of this one which are the same as that one, if you are able to remember.    And as far as you know, has he ever alleged that you compelled him to write that incomplete one?    Okay.  Thank you.    That is Andries van Tonder?  You said Andries Tonder.    Ja, it is van Tonder.  You said Andries Tonder.    Well if you – if it might be easy to find, you can have a look, but if it will not be easy, finding it might be homework for Monday.  Just depends if it can be found quickly    Ja, okay.      Yes, yes.      I think Mr Pretorius will just break it down for you.    But you did not attend that meeting yourself.  You are basing your response on what you were subsequently told.  Is that right?    Were the other members of the group to which you referred as whistle-blowers, were all of the members of the group, people who were previously worked for Bosasa but were no longer working for Bosasa or were there some people who were still within Bosasa?    Okay. Okay, no I am not sure if I understand that.  Are you saying that most of them were still within Bosasa.    Oh okay.    Maybe before he does, are you feeling exhausted now?    Yes.  Well I did not feel that the air-conditioner is not working.    But that will be looked into, but you are tired.    You would prefer that we adjourn.    Well anyway, we are seven minutes before we adjourn.  Maybe we should adjourn or do you want to – is there one question you wanted to complete?    No, I am quite happy to continue, but I think it has been a long day for the witness ...[intervenes]    Ja and if he is tired, we should allow him to -  we should stop.    Yes. Yes.  No.  Thank you.  We are going to adjourn and we will    To the legal team.    Okay, shall we say that we will adjourn until 10   Yes. Thank you.    We therefore adjourn until 10
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair.     Thank you Chair.  Mr Agrizzi we finished yesterday at paragraph 12.6 of your affidavit and that is where there is reference to the video EXHIBIT S1.    Right.   Yes please.    That is EXHIBIT S2, or ...[intervenes]?    It is the bundle that was handed to you Chair yesterday, it is the second volume of the statement and annexures.  We have referred to it as EXHIBIT S2.    Okay.    And the handwriting on page 586 Mr Agrizzi is that also your handwriting?    You should spell that name for the record please?    IN or EN?    And the Allin how is that spelt?    If I may just interject.  All these documents emanate from the black book?    Or the black books.    Before you go on to another page, in the photograph sheet on the right-hand side.    On page 600 of EXHIBIT S2, there is next to thenumber 4 an amount of R110 000 and in brackets after that "PG".  Do you know from your own knowledge what that denotes?    Again page 600 is your handwriting, is it?    Would you spell both please if you can?    I am just looking for the note Chair, if you would bear with me.      And the irregularity Chair.    Chair you mentioned the regularity or otherwise of what we referred to as "other benefits other than cash".    You also at a stage queried the total amount of bribes approximately per day, or per period of time.      And then you also asked how regularly the safe was filled at some stage.   And then how many people were paid at a time.      But we have dealt more or less with those questions.    Yes.  Can I say what the legal team's intention is in this regard?    At the evidence – at the end of the evidence we will do asweep of all outstanding issues ...[intervenes]    That might being raised by you, or that might then be logically outstanding and we will deal with them.    Thank you Chair.      Thank you Chair.  In the next two paragraphs Mr Agrizzi you deal with matters relating to the handling of cash and who handled it and at what manner.  May I refer you to paragraph 12.7 of your statement?  What was the case in regard to what may be termed "high profile officials"?  We will get to detail later.      And particularly over the months of December andJanuary each year, or December each year?    What would happen then?    Right.  Then in paragraph 12.8 you give general evidence as to the method used if someone came to you asking for a favour or any benefit, what was that?    Would he then approve or not approve?    Right.    Alright.  From what you knew and during the period that you were responsible for cash transactions and a keeping of records in the sense that it was up to you to reconcile, I mean responsible in that sense.  Are you able to say whether Gavin Watson would have known himself of everything in relation to payments and in particular whether he knew of all the payments that left Bosasa for the purpose of bribery?    I am dealing Mr Agrizzi with paragraph 12.9.  Do you believe, from your own knowledge that Gavin Watson knew the extent of payments going out that were not recorded?    Sorry the – I am sorry Chair.      The amount that you just mentioned that you found in the refuse bag, what was that amount again please?    And then in paragraph ...[intervenes]    Alright.  In the remainder of paragraph 12.9 Mr Agrizzi you deal with the drop-safe.  You have already given that evidence.    You do not need to repeat it.  And then in paragraph 12.10, you deal with the issue very briefly of shortages under your watch.  What was the position?    Is that when money was being physically handled?    Then in paragraph 12.11 you deal with the topic that you have been questioned about from the Chair in relation to favours other than cash payments.  Would you describe those briefly for the Chair please?    Vehicle repairs how were they done in an outside garage or an internal facility to Bosasa?   Your reference to Karano, is that the same entity that you referred to yesterday?    Okay.  When you talked about accounting for these expenses, please provide the Chair with a little detail, how were they accounted for,under what head, or in what category of expense?    Are you personally aware of vehicles being serviced for any particular individual that you recall?    In paragraph 12.2 you mention a name.  Who is that person and what is his connection with the matters you are dealing with?    And you say his vehicle was serviced?   And who authorised the servicing of that particular vehicle?    Alright.  Just look at paragraph 12.12 please the third sentence, you say in your affidavit that you would authorise the servicing, which is correct?    So you say ...[intervenes]    Thus far Mr Agrizzi and in general terms, you have testified as to payments made to various people and the methods used to effect those payments.  You have also mentioned very briefly receipt of cash ...[intervenes]    The name.    It may have been mentioned softly Chair.   But it was mentioned.      Is that correct, you have mentioned the name of the person there?    Just to go back a step Mr Agrizzi you have given evidence thus far amongst other things of the general methods used to make cash payments and what happened in the Bosasa offices in that respect.  You will givefurther detailed evidence in that regard in due course.    You have also mentioned receipt of cash.    In other words, in order to make these payments, Bosasa had to have in its possession large amounts of cash to the extent that you have already testified.    The next section of your affidavit then deals with how Bosasa obtained cash.    Alright.  In 13.1 you deal with one such method of obtaining cash, or concealing cash transactions.  What was that method?    Why was that done?    Alright.  Then you go further in paragraph 13.2 of your affidavit and you relate how in relation to cashing cheques at the bank and the issuing of fake invoices, these were done in the name of other entities.  Please tell the Chair what happened?    Spell that please?  Is that KGWETLO [spelt]?    You spoke in a previous answer now Mr Agrizzi of small or start-up names.  Did you mean small or start-up companies?    And you say in paragraph 13.2 'with no VAT numbers',what is the significance of that?    And you refer to the company called Kgwetlo Events and Mr and Ms Gwebu.  Did they know, again to your knowledge of the use of their name on false invoices?    Who drew up the invoices?    Alright.  The system of issuing false invoices in order to conceal the generation of cash through the issuing of cash cheques, did it replace a previous system?   We will deal in a moment, as I recall with the reason for the termination of that practice.  But before we go on Mr Agrizzi, Carlos Bonifacio what position did he hold in Bosasa?    And are his full names Carlos Bonifacio?      You refer to him again in paragraph 13.3.    Just tell the Commission the circumstances that gave rise to the events that you refer to in that paragraph?    Alright.     The documents that were forwarded to by Mr Bonifacio, have you kept these documents?    Have you made them available to the Commission investigators?    Chair to the extent that they may become relevant, or may in fact be relevant, we will deal with that issue.    In paragraph 13.4 you perhaps repeat what you said earlier about the use of companies in order to filter payments.  Just tell the Chair what you are saying in paragraph 13.4 regarding the use of companies at an arms length as you say here?    Alright.  You describe another way of generation ...[intervenes]    Sorry Chair.    Just for the record and my notes Chair.    And the information being?    I have to ensure homework is properly done.      You then deal in paragraph 13.5 Mr Agrizzi with another manner in which cash could be generated for the purposes of bribery as you have described in your evidence in the past two days.  Would you relate to the Chair how this scheme worked and please take it step-by-step?    An EFT?    Yes.    I am sorry I interrupted you in a train of thought, but take your time.    So let us take it step-by-step, because the scheme can be quite confusing, unless one follows it step-by-step.    Let us just summarise.    Of the consumption in another way.  Because this scheme is difficult to follow.  Bosasa orders liquor for a million rand by way of example from the wholesaler?    The wholesaler then invoices Bosasa?    In the sum of a million rand and by EFT transfer R1 million in actual money is paid to the Liquor Wholesaler?    That is one box of transactions?    Now the Liquor Wholesaler has not delivered any liquor pursuant to that order.    But it is now sitting with R1 million by EFT transfer?    It has cash and so it provides this cash to the agent?    The agent takes his cut and delivers the balance to Bosasa?    And so what one has on the one hand is a series of orders, invoices and EFT payments for the records, and on the other hand one has cash movement on the other?    Alright.  In paragraph 13.6 Mr Agrizzi you talk about cash drawings for cash cheques and how these are reflected on the bank statements.  What was the position initially, or when these schemes first started being implemented?   You say that the payments that were being made were too small.  You mean they were being made to small and start-up companies?                         Then in paragraph 13.7, at the bottom of page 26 you refer to another method utilised by Bosasa to generate cash.  Again step-by-step if you will, would you tell the Chair what happened here?    Were records of these transactions kept?    Thank you, just to summarise once again Mr Agrizzi, in relation to the death benefits issue, there were two really separate transactions, one when a family member died the company Bosasa would give an advance of theamount covered by the death benefit and later recover this money from Metropolitan?    Okay, the other transaction was to say to the – well not to say to the employee but was to record in your books a cash donation to the family arising out of the circumstances of the death of the family member but not to give that cash when that cash was drawn, to the family member or to the family but rather keep it for the purposes of generating cash for bribes.    I do not want you to deal at this stage with 13.8 of your statement Mr Agrizzi, we will deal with it later when and if appropriate but can we go then to paragraph 13.9.  Before we do so this death benefit scheme, and particularly the second transaction where a donation would be made for which ostensibly but not in reality cash was withdrawn from your accounts and given, or Bosasa accounts and given to the employee's family, did the employees know about this?   Then let us go to paragraph 13.9.  You say in that paragraph that you were able to estimate the amount of cash that was drawn or generated over a period of time, and you refer to a monthly period here.  Would you relate these calculations and their implications for income tax, to the Chair please, and you deal with that in paragraph 13.9 and 13.10 of your affidavit.    Sorry Chair it is, I am told, past 11   Thank you Chair.  We were, Mr Agrizzi, at paragraph 13.9 of your statement and you were about to relate to the Chair the calculations ofmonies, cash monies referred to in paragraph 13.9 and 13.10.    But for present purposes and simply put in large amount the payment of cash bribes was accounted for as company expenses to the Receiver of Revenue?   In paragraph 13.12 Mr Agrizzi, you deal with another method used to generate cash.  Would you relate that please to the Chair?    Alright so far as the fuel station is concerned it would receive money in cash?    From the motorists.    It would give that cash to Bosasa.    It would not be out of pocket because it would be reimbursed.    By Bosasa by way of EFT transfer.    So instead of having cash it had money accounted for through an EFT transfer.   But for its troubles Bosasa then had cash?    Now you have told the Chair that the details of these transactions, the calculation or the calculation of the value of these transactions, the people involved is a matter of detail and in relation to any investigation that mightarise you are willing to cooperate.    But from your own knowledge, from your writing out of your duties at Bosasa and giving your position in Bosasa when these transactions were effected you have personal knowledge of these transactions having taken place.    Alright.    As I understand it, I am sorry did I interrupt an answer Mr Agrizzi?  As I understand it Mr Agrizzi, you have a large amount of documentation.    In fact boxes of documents.    As well as electronic information?    Alright paragraph 13.4 Mr Agrizzi, contains another method used by Bosasa to generate cash.  Again you talk about it at a general level, would you describe to the Chair the method referred to here?    To the Youth Centre?    Can you say when this would have occurred?    No, perhaps what we should do Chair is test the extent of the witness's knowledge.   The remoteness or directness of the knowledge.    Yes I will.    But if I may just precede that with understanding the scheme and where the various ...[intervenes].    Spheres of influence would lie.  To describe the process of cash generation first, and we will come to this issue afterwards, a Youth Development Centre.    Being administered and run by Bosasa?    In fact owned by Bosasa?   Alright, okay.  They say to Bosasa, and this is all arranged of course, we need a software programme?    And Bosasa then supplies the software programme?    This has either been costed in the expenses already or it is provided at no cost to Bosasa?    The youth development centre, do I understand it, then pays Bosasa for the provision of that service?    Yes, and it is the – yes I understand, it is the department responsible for the provision of that service ultimately through Bosasa?    Alright, and would then pay the amount to Bosasa?    So this money is paid and received by Bosasa?    Ultimately for no value?    Part of the money, I understand, would be retained by Bosasa?    And part would be paid to whom?    So this whole scheme or arrangement is in order to provide cash to someone else?    An official who requested cash?    Now you have said that the reason or the underlying motive for the whole arrangement of the provision of cash was, as you described it, for elections.    So someone, either the official at the youth development centre or someone else initiates this transaction through a request to Bosasa?    And you say that the motive or the reason therefore you know and that is what we are going to test now, is the funding for elections.  How do you know that?  Is there something that you know?  Is it something that you can reliably testify to or is it conjecture on your part?    We do not want to hear conjecture.    Alright now before you tell the Chair of the final destination of this money for elections, just tell the Chair on what you base such knowledge.  You say there was a meeting.   What did this meeting have to do with these monies generated at paragraph 13.14 of your statement?    The request of cash?    And it was made by whom?    So involved in this transaction was the person who requested it, an MEC and Syvion Dlamini?    Alright, let us take ...[intervenes].    Alright well perhaps it is safe to ask the following question Chair, and I would be guided by you because ultimately you are in charge of the leading of evidence.  I am not passing the buck Chair but do you know whether Mr Dlamini and the MEC that you have referred to, had connections with any particular political party?    Alright let us go to paragraph 13.15 please.    Well there is more detail in relation to the allegations in 13.14, in paragraph 13.15 but I ...[intervenes].   But I have completed 13.14 Chair.    Alright in paragraph 13.15 Mr Agrizzi you deal with the North West youth development facilities and you refer to transactions happening on numerous occasions, would you just describe what you are referring to in that paragraph, for the Chair please.    [Indistinct] opening expense, would you just describe it please?   When you say pay the people, would you be a bit more specific please?    So once you had been reassured that Bosasa had not been defrauded, cash was paid out, someone else was defrauded is that right?    And that was the Government department that had paid for non-existent expenditure or inflated costs for services provided?    Alright.  You receive the money and then you pay out cash, and by you I mean Bosasa?    And is that the cash that you refer to in paragraph13.16 and about which you have now testified money required by, as you say here individuals for elections?    Alright let us digress for a moment to deal with the issues in paragraph 13 ...[intervenes].    Well except that the youth development centre might report to the official concerned that value had been received because there was a disguised transaction, a request for software or a ...[intervenes].    Can we deal Mr Agrizzi, with the issues you raise in paragraph 13.17 and 13.18, and in essence what you deal with here is why it would be difficult for any audit or anyone looking at the books of the company to recognise that there was something amiss, and you talk here about the cash drawings in the books of the company related to the turnover or the amounts in the books of Bosasa as a whole.  So would you just deal please with the issues raised in paragraph 13.17 and 13.18.    We will do more.    You referred to public holiday costs over the December period, what is a public holiday cost?    Alright and just formally Mr Agrizzi, you say the word, in the first line of paragraph 13.18 including should read excluding?    Alright well we will have a look at that during an adjournment and correct if necessary.    Yes, I will deal with it, thank you Chair.  In paragraph 13.14 and 13.15 as well as 13.16 you describe a general method of generating cash.   And as you say we will deal with specific examples in due course but for the present you spoke of one transaction that was discussed at a meeting in the North West to which you referred, and you have given detail to the Chair.  Can you estimate the value of that particular transaction?    Let us move on then to paragraph 14 of your statement and affidavit.  The Chair will recall reference to the Lindela Repatriation Facility, this appears to be from your statement, another method of cash generation.  Would you describe that please to the Chair?    Over what period?    Sorry, you say the average takings were R300 000?    For what period?    Per day, month, year, per month?    Yes.    Again I am sorry Chair.   Again just to summarise, at the Lindela Repatriation Facility administered by Bosasa?    There would at any one time be several thousand people resident there or detained there.  They would make cash payments to tuck shops and canteens or to Bosasa for the use of cell phones at the facility, that cash would be retained and delivered to Bosasa for its use?    The cost of those sales, for example the cell phonecosts and the canteen costs, the food and groceries there was nevertheless expensed in the books of Bosasa as an operational expense?    Alright can we move on then to cash bars and canteens, a similar method of cash generation as described here, would you tell the Chair about it please?    Alright, and that cash was used for the purposes you say here, that you have described to the Chair previously in your evidence is that correct?    Then for how long did this practice in relation to the hostels, continue or did it at a time cease and why?    Alright, you say in paragraph 16.1, under the head cash drawings, that during the period 2003 to 2004.    And as a result of the fact that the bars and canteens used to generate cash, had been sold as part of the sale of the mining contract, as you have just now referred to, other arrangements had to be made to sustain cash income.  And then you describe in paragraph 16.2 and following that further method.  Will you tell the Chair about that please?    So were these ghost workers?    And in paragraph 16.3 you say that one method of disguising, I presume you mean here the expense, was to allocate them to certain facilities under construction.  Would you tell the Chair about that please?    Yes thank you Mr Agrizzi.  In paragraph 16.4 then you go on to talk of risks, and please tell the Chair about what occurred here that you are relating to, the Chair.    Sorry if I may just interrupt you, these three cheques ostensibly were for wages?    The practice of generating cash through the ostensible payment of wages to workers who did not actually exist, ghost workers, was that stopped at some stage?    Alright so because the law required the keeping of records even where casual labour had to be paid in cash.    Would expose Bosasa to risk.    Right I just want to check something with you please, you say in paragraph 15.2 that the practice of taking cash from hostels, canteens and bars dwindled in 2003 and 2004, do you see that?  You say that in paragraph 15.2.    You say then that special arrangements had to be made, presumably you mean after that, for a new scheme to generate cash.    And you then talk about this ghost worker scheme.    But then you say that, in paragraph 17.1, the Department of Labour made the payment of casual wages subject to all types of scrutiny in 2003.  So I am just not sure of the casual wages system replacing the other system.  What is the time sequence of these schemes and if you could just try and tell the Chair when each scheme more or less was prevalent?    Alright so this casual wage scheme for the generation of cash, the ghost worker casual wage scheme, for how long did that last?   We may look at the dates finally, at the end of your evidence.    Yes, no, you see if one looks at page 31 and 32, and Iwill try and be brief on this because it possibly could be cleared up later, you say that the ghost worker scheme was generated after 2003 and 2004?    But you say it was stopped as a result of what the Department of Labour did in 2003?    So if it started after 2003 and 2004, but ended when the Department of Labour issued its directions or regulations in 2003, the times do not really make sense.    But insofar as the dates are indicative at least of general periods, the casual wages ghost worker scheme cannot have lasted for very long as I understand your evidence.   Alright that makes more sense.    To be fair to you Mr Agrizzi, in paragraph 16.1 you do say in relation to this particular ghost worker issue, that it occurred, I assume it is what you mean here in paragraph 16.1, during the period 2003 and 2004.    Can we move then to the heading equal trade in paragraph 18 of your statement?  You refer back in paragraph 18.1, to the method of generating cash through the purchase of liquor from Jumbo Wholesalers, and the Chair questioned you about the quantities of liquor involved.  Do you recall that exchange?    Alright, would you just tell the Chair then of the scheme developed in paragraph 18.1 and why it was developed.   What [indistinct] ...[intervenes].    If you would just pause there a moment please.    How many catering operations approximately, did Bosasa have nationally at that time?  Can you say?   And does that mean that the volume of poultry that would be dealt with by Bosasa was substantial?    And you say in paragraph 18.2 that you made certain payments on the instruction of Gavin Watson.  You do say and you have just said to the Chair that you were not to enthusiastic to put it at its lowest about this particular transaction.    But it seems clear from your evidence that on the instruction of Gavin Watson, you did pay the persons who implemented the scheme, money in order to buy their loyalty to Bosasa and the scheme.    Yeah.   But despite your discomfort, you did make the payments to facilitate the scheme.    And to reward those implementing the scheme.    In paragraph 18.3 you refer to another payment.  Whatpayment is that?    He received R20 000 per month in relation to the executing [indistinct].    The extent of your personal knowledge in this regard, did you actually take part in the execution of this process and if not, where does your knowledge come from?    Paragraph – I am sorry.    Paragraph 19 Mr Agrizzi, you say briefly how the scheme worked and you compared the standard process, the correct lawful proper process with the system – Fraudulent system that was actually implemented to generate this cash.  In paragraph 19.1, you described a standard process, the correct process or the lawful process.  Would you tell the chair what that is briefly?    Well you do not have to go into so much detail.    And those names are fictitious names I presume.    Do you know the surnames?    In any event ...[intervenes].    There is a correctional facility which is ordered.    By Bosasa.  Payment by Bosasa.    If I may just summarise then.  Goods would be ordered by Correctional Services Facility.    Those goods would be delivered and received.    A comprehensive recordal system would record quantities.   An invoice would then be generated, issued to Bosasa and payment would be made.    That is the proper system, how it should work.    What does the fraudulent system involve?    Just the invoice.   Where any goods delivered or received?    Either before or after.    You just left out one sentence.  If I may then take it stepby step.  The fraudulent system, as I understand it, involves the generation and delivery of an invoice to Bosasa.    Bosasa then pays this invoice by means of an electronic transfer.    No goods are delivered and obviously no goods are received at the facility.    It is an entirely fictitious transaction.   After payment is made by way of EFT, does Bosasa receive any monies and how does this happen?    Alright, so you pay by means of EFT.  Bosasa pays this fictitious invoice by the [Intervenes].    Does not receive anything in return.    From whom?   Alright, was there any deduction from the amount of the invoice?    And what particular company was involved in the    So to summarise from the point of view of equal trade, they would receive and order, they would invoice fictitiously.  They would invoice Bosasa, Bosasa would pay by EFT and the Equal Trade would take its own cash and give it to EFT minus its commission.    Right.  Do you have the full name of Equal Trade.  Is it a(Pty) Limited company?  Is it a business name?  What is it?     Alright and then you say these transactions require to avoid scrutiny by the revenue services and one method used to avoid scrutiny was to include on these fictitious items, items that would be zero-rated for VAT purposes.    So there would be no necessity to pay VAT in respect of sales where beans, maize meal, oil and rice are concerned for example.    That was your earlier evidence.   And you say that one anomaly in the scheme in so far as it involved VAT is that the standard or the items reflected on the fictitious invoices were often, if not all standard stock items in Correctional Services Facilities or on their menu plan.    But the transaction could be traced, because ourinvestigators for example, because for example if a prison did not use beans and yet was paying for beans, there would be an anomaly there that would raise suspicion.    You say in paragraph 19.4 however, comparing the standard process to the fraudulent process and looking at the detail of each and every transaction, is a detailed and complex task.    And you say in paragraph 19.4, but I can be done.    Yes.  And you also say here that you are willing to assist in that investigation process in regard to the detail of the investigation.    We are going to move onto paragraph 20, but I, for the present do not want you to mention any name of any entity.  You can talk about a wholesaler and Mr Venter, but no one else.  Okay?  Until we feel it appropriate to do so.    Would you then with that word of caution please describe the scheme referred to under this head.    As I have suggested.    Do no mention the name of the firm please.    Yes.  Well if I can just summarise, because we are going to move on to a new topic now.  This particular scheme in paragraph 20.4 A, A Wholesalers would provide goods to Bosasa.  Goods which were used by Bosasa in its business.    Right.  They would however over invoice.MR ANGELO AGRIZZI   Charge you more than they actually provided.    To the value of which they provided.    So there would be over invoicing and falsification of the documentation relevant to the transaction.    And the amount of the over invoicing and ultimately the overpayment, would be returned to Bosasa in cash.    Now, I would like to deal please with Mr Venter andcircumstances relevant to Mr Venter’s involvement with yourself during 2017.    During 2017, what was Mr Venter doing with you or in relation to yourself and what you were doing at the time?    I am referring to 2017 and I think it is November.  Yes.  November and December.   Who was at that meeting?    Alright.MR ANGELO AGRIZZI   I understand the sequence then very broadly to be and there may be more detail in due course, Piet Venter was part of a group of contemplated whistle blowers working with you.     Pursuant to that, he was preparing a statement recording matters relevant to the whistle blowing exercise.    He met with you and one other in December – Beforethat he stated his intention to withdraw from the whistle blowing exercise.    However he came to you early December and one other and said he wish to re-join the whistle blowing exercise in collaboration with the rest of the group.    You told him then, well if that is so, please turn your statement into a sworn affidavit.    That happened during the December period.    On his return in January, he came back to you and said no, he no longer wish to be part of the group.    We will come to that detail in a moment.  If you look at ANNEXURE F on page 252, that is in Exhibit S1.  Chair the status of this affidavit, the information contained in this affidavit will – I am informed by the investigators be a matter of some controversy.  In order to deal with that controversy, it is necessary to gothrough the contents of the affidavit and in particular to deal with the references to Mr Agrizzi, if there is such a reference to him in the affidavit.  Nevertheless, I would like to deal with this affidavit on the basis of establishing from the witness the circumstances which to his knowledge surrounded its delivery to him, its signing, what happened before, what happened afterwards in relation to the whistle blowers and what he knows of the correctness of the facts contained here, so we do not necessarily rely on this affidavit to prove the facts in the affidavit certainly at this stage.  That may happen later, but at this stage, it is merely to say Mr Agrizzi, what do you say about the fact referred to here.   Is it true and correct?    Thank you.  So if we can go to page 252 please.  Do you recognise this document?    Is this the affidavit of what you had spoken?    Please go for a moment to page 266.    You see a signature there.    Under the name Petrus Stephanus Venter.    Do you know the signature?   And underneath the signature are the words 19th day of December 2017 at George, Western Cape, South Africa.    To your knowledge, at that time 19 December 2017, where was Mr Venter holidaying?    And if you look at the bottom of the page 266, you will see the affirmation on oath, signed and sworn/affirmed to me at – and I cannot read those words.  I do not know if you can, but there is a date there 18 December 2017.      And at the bottom of the page is a signature of a Commissioner of Oaths and at the bottom of the – further down at the bottom of the page, full names, status.  I think it is Warrant Officer and a street address in MosselBay.    I think it is Mossel Street and that is repeated over the page on page 267.    Do you see that?    So on the face of it, at least this affidavit was attested to in December 2017 in the Western Cape or Eastern Cape.  I am not sure Mossel Bay and George are on the Western Cape, but they are in the Cape.   Far from Gauteng.    At this time, where were you?    Okay, let us go back to ...[intervenes].    There is also the 19th, but for the moment, you were inDainfern on both 18th and the 19th.    Mr Agrizzi, we now need to deal with the contents of the affidavit on the basis that I have spoken to the Chair about. Chair, would this be a    Thank you Chair.  Mr Watson [should be Mr Agrizzi] we were dealing with the affidavit of Mr Venter and the attestation which appears at page    When did you receive a copy of this affidavit, signed and sworn?    Alright.  So as far as I understand your evidence after the meeting in December, he left, he then went on holiday and in January you received a statement.  I gather from that that you would know nothing about the particular datesupon which the affidavit was prepared and actually signed and sworn.    Right.    266 Chair of the Bundle S2.      The only point I raise in this regard Mr Agrizzi that seems not to be matters within your knowledge, but perhaps the investigators can follow it up is that the statement appears to have been signed on the 19 December 2017 at Georgeand attested to on 18 December 2017 at Mossel Bay, but I am not sure that you can assist the Commission there.    Can we go back ...[intervenes].    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    And at page 252 is a document which we now know is    Okay, but you do not know whether that is true or not from your personal knowledge.    Then there is another heading.  Context of Tax Fraud    Where are those files now?    The attorney that represented you and others.    It goes on to read on the next paragraph on page 252   Tell the Chair what you know.    And did you do so?    And is the cover page of the affidavit you sent him, similar to the cover page of this affidavit.    Where did you two – what address did you send this model affidavit to which you refer?    You know where Mr Venter was at the time you sent theaffidavit?    Mr Agrizzi, I am going to take you through the contents of this affidavit.  The purpose of doing so as intimated to the Chair is to see what facts in this affidavit you agree with and of what facts you have no knowledge and what facts you disagree with so that all we are looking for at this stage is what knowledge you personally have in relation to the facts set out here.    The first paragraph reads   Right.  He then says in paragraph 2   Can you comment on any of the contents in paragraph 2?    And what is the position in relation to the contents of paragraph 3 and 4?  Can you comment on the correctness or otherwise of any  of theallegations there?    Let us look at paragraph 5.  Do you know whether it is correct that over the years Mr Venter built up a good relationship with Tony Perry, Andries van Tonder, Gavin Watson, Jacques van Zyl, Carlos Bonifacio.  All the directors and other employees of the Bosasa Group.    The next paragraph reads, Gavin Watson realised thisand wanted me to get more involved in the business in the form of a consultant from an external point of view.  I was there for not just a tax consultant for the Bosasa Group.  Do you know whether that is from your own knowledge true.    Do you know what role he played for the Bosasa Group?    At least you do know that it is true that he was not just a tax consultant for the Bosasa Group, but he performed other functions.    Alright, let us move on then.  He says in paragraph 7   And then he says again, the first bullet   He then says against the second bullet   At what time was this?  A valid statement.  In other words, to what period did the actions and dealing with a tax return relate?    And what was Patrick Gillingham’s position at that time?    Alright, when you say Patrick Gillingham was not employed at Correctional Services, perhaps we should be accurate and say when he was not employed and when he was employed at Correctional Services, to the extent that you can remember.    So, is your evidence that Gillingham would have left Correctional Services by 2009.   And then after that received employment within the  Bosasa Group.    And then reference is made to Mr Venter, dealing with the annual tax return of L $ T MTI [sic].    Do you know that to be a correct fact?   And do you know to which period that would relate?    Then in paragraph 8, the following statement is made   Are all the facts in paragraph 8 correct?    Paragraph 9 reads   If we can then go on please to paragraph 10 on page    You have seen proof of the payments.  Are those the payments referred to in the subsequent lines of paragraph 10?    Do you have those available?    So the paragraphs regarding payment read   And are they documents which reflect those amounts and dates?    Paragraph 11 then reads   Do you know anything about the transaction describedhere?    When you say you saw the transaction, do you mean to say that you actually saw a physical manifestation of the transaction or you saw a record of the transaction.    So you saw – did you see the agreement?   Did you know the agreement to be a genuine agreement or not?    And then you say further records.  Did these records relate to payment?    The paragraph continues on 255 paragraph 11 to read   Please tell the Chair, what that entity is?    Is that the agreement that you say you have seen?    And do you know whether services were provided or    Alright.   It continues to read   Okay, the first two payments and proof of these payments, when did you see them?  At the time they were made or at the time the affidavit was sent back to you with Annexures or both?   Thank you.    The affidavit concludes on page 255 at least.  The    Let us move then to page 256 at paragraph 12.     Who is Ms Lindie Gouws?    Alright.  Paragraph 2 reads ...[intervenes].    Yes Chair.    The second part of paragraph 12 then goes onto read   And in relation to the amount R2.5 million, do you know anything about that?    I am sorry, probably a deposit you say?    Do you know that a property was purchased at around this time?    And did the value of the property exceed R2.5 million?    Right.   If you go on then to the third part of paragraph 12, it    Right.  The next portion of paragraph 12 reads and these    Then in relation to the payment of R3 million, Mr Venter    Now let us just pause there please.  Do you know anything about the second payment referred to, from your own knowledge?    Alright.  Now just let us just pause there please.  The affidavit that we are dealing with now is, I understand in the public domain, do you know of that?    Right.  So this whole affidavit is not being released here for the first time, it is public knowledge?    The allegation here in relation to the R500 000, did you ever release that allegation to the Press?    Right.  And then if we may revert to paragraph 12 it    Let us move on then to paragraph 13, it says that   And do you know what was done subsequent to that realisation?    Alright.  So I presume then, you would not be able to comment on the meeting between Ms Gouws and her attorney that gave rise to that decision?    And nor would you have any knowledge of the attorneys who handled the property transaction, or its cancellation?   Alright.  So you say that as far as you are aware is correct?    Yes alright.  Then on page 257 further reference is made and you have made reference to the statement in paragraph 14 regarding payment of    Alright and you ...[intervenes]    Alright we will come to that.  But it is necessary to deal with it fully.  You have already told the Chair that you do not know whether that allegation is true and correct and you have also told the Chair that you are unable, or you are in fact able to say that you never released any such information to anyone, including the Media?    Yes.  Paragraph 15 reads   Alright.  Then in the second part of paragraph 15   And then it goes on to say   Alright.    Now if it is alleged in evidence, as we have learnt might be alleged, that this affidavit and its contents came about as a result of you compelling Venter to attest to this affidavit.  Is there any likelihood that you would have forced Venter, for example to put the facts contained in paragraph 14 and 15 on record and attest to it?  Would you have caused this, let alone by compulsion?   Well that is the point I am making, it is hardly logical that you compel him to make an affidavit attesting to facts of which you are not aware.    Paragraph 16 reads   Who did Mr Venter?    Right.     Are you saying that the practice referred to here is a practice that in your own experience and knowledge is known to you?    Alright.  Then in paragraph 17 is a reference to yourself    Well perhaps if you could just say, is it true or false?    Alright.  Then over the page, page 258 in the same    As to the remainder of that portion of the paragraph, what is your evidence?    Alright.  So you know something of the facts there?    Alright.  Paragraph 18   Generally speaking, do you know from your own knowledge whether Mr Patrick Gillingham received cash?    Were you ever present when such a delivery was made?    So we will come to that in due course.    And does that appear in your black book in fact?    Yes.  Let us go on the second part of paragraph 18    But is it in accordance with the practice that you knew?    He then says   Paragraph 19 reads   Right.  But you do have no direct knowledge of that?    You could never have told – I then conclude Mr Venter to put that in an affidavit, let alone coercion?    Paragraph 20 reads   Do you know anything about the circumstances of the sequestration, as fraud referred to here?    Alright.      Yes Chair.    Yes you are correct Chair.  The confrontation in the full context may well have taken place between Mr Watson.  Now Mr Venter on the one hand and Mr Pasanno on the other.    Because it was Mr Pasanno's estate that was involved.  Yes I apologise.    "The point being that neither the witness Mr Agrizzi nor I know anything about the contents of this paragraph."   Right you say that is correct.  Do you know what SeaArk was?   Right.  And it had, it is apparent an assessed loss of over R138 million.  Are you aware of that as a fact?    Right.  And that occurred, according to the affidavit as at the 2012 tax year?    Are you ...[intervenes]   So it was a costly investment?    You say you know of the facts in the first three lines of that paragraph.  Do you know anything about the use of that loss by filtering the tax exposure of profits into other operations via that entity SeaArk?  In other words, attributing the loss to other companies?    Right.  From your own knowledge?   Right.  Paragraph 22 reads   Thank you.  I am not sure that you made clear to the Chair whether you know of this particular set of facts set out in paragraph 22, as opposed to the practice?    So your knowledge of this transaction and its implications emanates from your discussions with Peet Venter?    Alright.  Let us go then to paragraph 23.  Perhaps I pre-   You know of that again on the same basis that you know of the facts in the previous paragraph?    Paragraph 24 reads   Again on the same basis as you referred to before.    So you have seen, in writing, the representations made to SARS.    So you have seen independent documentation or documentation which independently verifies the allegations at least in paragraph 24.    And the documents you have seen, are they consistent with the contents in paragraph 24?    And then let us go onto paragraph 25.  We not got into any detail there, but there is a calculation of the assessed loss and the tax that would have been payable in respect thereof and the fact that there was a right off allowed bySARS, pursuant to their investigation.    Would it have been possible for you, given the facts you knew yourself as opposed to the facts you have learned to have told Mr Venter to – Let alone compelled Mr Venter to make the allegations that he did in paragraph 21 to 25.    Let us move on then to paragraph 26 and paragraph 27.     You know of that fact.    The houses were to be registered on Gavin Watson’s name to the best of my knowledge.  Do you know anything about that?    Paragraph 27 reads   Just remind the Chair.  Luipaardsvlei Property -  I do not know if you have mentioned that company before?  What company is that?    Luipaardsvlei Property, is that entity or that property owned by any company in the Bosasa Group?    And Leading Prospect Trading Lindela etcetera, you have already told the Chair that the Lindela Repatriation Centre was managed or administered by the Bosasa Company, Leading Prospect Trading.  Correct?    It is Leading Prospect Trading 111 (Pty) Ltd.    And is it correct that at the time, large revamps were underway in respect of these properties?    And the affidavit continues to say, these costs were either capitalised or expensed within the existing property companies that held properties within the group of companies.  I presume there reference there, it is common sense, it is the Bosasa Group of Companies?    Do you know that that actually occurred, either specifically in this case?  If not, generally?    And then it continues to say   He was in fact retrenched.    Then on the top of page 261, the first part of paragraph    So you say, you know generally about the facts being attested to here, but your knowledge of tax matters is not sophisticated enough to allow you to construct such a paragraph with its conclusions.    And then the paragraph concludes by saying   That Christo Viljoen firstly as an employee of Bosasa and he oversaw the construction of those houses.    Alright.  Paragraph 28 reads   What in particular in its detail.  They are quite serious allegations, potentially in the context of all the facts which we will come to.    So you say you know about those facts.  They are correct, but just to place those facts in a context in case there is any confusion.  You have told the Chair that until 2009 I think, Mr Gillingham was employed by the Department of Correctional Services.  Is that correct?    During the period of his employment with the Department of Correction Services, was Mr Gillingham receiving payments from Bosasa?   In what amount?    So when Patrick Gillingham left and we may talk about those circumstances later in your evidence, the Department of Correctional Services and after that date, he continued to be paid monies by the Bosasa.  Is that correct?    Let us go on then to paragraph 29.  The paragraph reads    What do you say, what are you able to say to the Chair about firstly the correctness of the allegations here and secondly any explanation of the scheme underlying these facts or allegations?    So you know these facts to be true.  Do you know how the scheme worked or how the benefit was derived, apart from what is contained here, because I am not sure I understand?    Thank you.  Let us then move to paragraph 30 on page    And do you know that from your personal knowledge?    And you will give evidence at another stage of those two trusts.    The second part of paragraph 30 on page 262 reads   Let us just take a step back at this stage because it seems to me that your personal knowledge is insufficient to construct allegations likethis, relating to tax.  Am I correct?    Although this affidavit was sent to you in January 2018, it was drafted during November 2017.    The allegation might be that you did not compel Venter to attest to this affidavit in December 2017 but you were involved in the drafting of the statement at that stage during November and you forced him to say what he says here.  What do you say to that?    I presume we can infer that you did not.    Let us then go to paragraph 31 ...[intervenes].    Alright.  Let us – perhaps I am in the interest of time trying to bundle too much into a question.  I apologise.  I will take my time.    Insofar as I ...[intervenes]    Yes   Yes.  My apologies Chair.  16   We have some information from the investigators that it would be said that you compelled Mr Venter to attest to this affidavit.    You have said in relation to that allegation, well of course you could not have because he was in the Cape and you were in Dainfern at the time the affidavit was attested to.    But the allegation against you may be something different.  It may be that the allegation that you forced Mr Venter to write up these facts and to ultimately attest to them on affidavit did not occur in December, but occurred earlier in November when the statement which formed the basis of this affidavit was drafted, because you have said that you saw a statement in this form early in December.  Correct?    So I am saying to you that if it was or is in future put to you, well Mr Agrizzi we are not talking about December when you might have been in Dainfern and Mr Venter was in the Cape, we are talking about November and it is in November that you forced him to put these facts on paper.  What do you say to that?  Iknow that there is a logical answer which you have alluded to, but what do you say to that?    Yes.   Thank you.    And that then gives rise to the second question alluded to by the Chair now.  You have told the Chair that the purpose of annexing this affidavit to your disclosures is to show amongst other things, tax fraud.   Your knowledge of tax, we are learning and have learned is not the most detailed or sophisticate.    Right.  Is it possible for you to have either compelled Mr Venter to put the allegations that he did put in this affidavit into the affidavit or to draft these allegations on his behalf – You know with him to make them up.    December.    Right.  If we may move on then Mr Agrizzi on page 262    Alright.  So apart from your question as to the logic of the allegations here or what happened here, you do not know of these transactions?    Alright.  Did you have the extract quoted here on this page and the following page in your possession at any time?   Did you give this extract that you had to Mr Venter for the purposes of compiling this affidavit?    Let us go to paragraph 33 then.  Well, let us first deal    Now, one significant difference.  It appears – and please correct me if I am wrong.  Between the approach and this affidavit and your approach and perhaps of the other whistle blowers, we will learn in due course, is that, I take that you admit that you benefitted from the corruption and dishonesty created by Gavin Watson?    Yes and you have actually set that out in your affidavit.    Right, but the difference in approach and a factor that isdifferent from your approach and that of Mr Venter’s.  Mr Venter said he did not benefit.  So again that goes to whether you would have compelled Venter to say what he said in paragraph 32.  I know you said generally you did not.    Then let us go to paragraph 33.  An important note, says   Andries van Tonder.    Did I.  Swallowed the ‘van’.  I am sorry.  What do you know about those facts?    Alright.  It is an important allegation and we will deal with it again when we deal with the SIU report, because there appears to be corroborating information, but for the moment, when the ‘crash’ occur.      Related to the SIU investigation.    We will learn more when we deal with later evidence.    But in your own words, would you tell the Chair please what occurred in relation to the crash.    These are dot images on computers.    Alright.  What was the purpose of the crash?  It may seem obvious, but perhaps you should place it on record.    And again it may seem fairly obvious to those in the know, what actually is a crash and how does it work or how does it not work?   And what happens to the data on the system in a crash.    So subject to recovery means a crash is designed to destroy electronically stored information or digitally stored information.    The affidavit continues to read in paragraph 33   Do you know whether it had occurred?    Do you know of any circular sent out to employees of Bosasa at around the time you are referring to.  November 2017?    So insofar as that is corroborating evidence, it is available.    Screenshot of crash.    Yes, but you will mark on Monday.    So can we go on and what is described in these words that we have just read onto the record is the purpose of the crash or alleged crash that one could get rid of potentially hazardous data files that could incriminate the companyand its directors.  Is that consistent with your understanding of at least the first computer crash?    Let us move on then to paragraph 34 on page 264.  It    Well let us take it step by step.    Yes, I will.  Let us first start.  Do you know – well, let usstart one step back.  By 13 November 2017, had the draft statement that you have attested to prepared by Mr Venter indeed been prepared.    So by 13 November, Peet Venter has his draft statement.    He then talks about a meeting that he had with amongst others Gavin Watson.  Do you know anything about that meeting?    Tried to convince of what?   Okay, so from your knowledge, however derived, you say that by 13 November Venter has prepared a statement, not yet signed.    There then is a meeting and at the hands of Gavin Watson, attempt is made to persuade him not to sign the statement.    Then the last sentence of that paragraph, reads   Right, so in fact it is correct that there was such a meeting at your home on 12 November 2017.  You recall it.  What happened at that meeting?    Right, once again Mr Agrizzi, we do not know what anyone else will allege about this affidavit and its contents, but I have just glanced over the contents of paragraph 34 on this page and the following page.  Nowhere is it said, here in this paragraph 34 that Mr Venter told Mr Gavin, yes I have signed an affidavit orI have not signed an affidavit.  I have prepared a statement and I was forced to do so, compelled to do so against my will by Mr Agrizzi.  It is not said here and you know that.    Right, but what is interesting at this stage you say from your knowledge, the statement had already been prepared.    All that remained according to your evidence is that that statement had to be attested to.    So at the stage the evidence had been prepared, thereappears to be no allegation when might have expected it here that you had compelled its drafting and preparation.    And you have already testified that the statement was discussed in December, by early December, but you had no contact with Mr Venter in relation to its actual attestation on 18 or 19 December 2017.  2017 is it?     Alright.  Let us go on then.  It reads at the bottom of    It goes on, on the next page   It goes on, on page 265, paragraph 34 to read   Was it told to you by Mr Venter that Mr Watson’s attitude was that in addition to himself, Agrizzi and van Tonder were implicated?    Right and by an addition to himself, I mean in addition to him, Gavin Watson.    The next paragraph reads   Alright and it appears that what Mr Watson was saying according to Mr Venter at least was that you, Angelo Agrizzi and Andries van  Tonder were the creators of the systems and the procedures involving these transactions.  Is that correct?   Did you create the systems and the procedures?    Would you speak up a little please.  I know it is late on a Friday.    Far be it for me to persuade you to continue Chair.      It has been a long few weeks.    Thank you Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Good morning Chair.    That is correct Chair.      May I add something?  Chair asked me a question yesterday.    That was beyond my control unfortunately.    We will my Chair, we will.    Can I respond to you Chair?   With regards to the balances?     Okay.  If you turn to the second file Annexure that is referred to is 584, page 584.    Correct.      Page 584.    Yes.      If I can just give you a bit of background, this is at page ...[intervenes]    This is a page out of the black book, one of them that I managed to find.  If you look at the first one it says "January to February 2016".    And the word says "recon", I know my handwriting is very bad.  It says recon.   Transfer, TRF which stands for transfer back to petty-cash.    J van Zyl and an amount of R107 000 off order.      What that basically means is that from the order that came in R107 000 was used out of a separate petty-cash, which is a normal company petty-cash, but there was a shortage, so they used a R107 000 from the delivery for to replace the petty-cash so that it would balance.      On the 18th February 2016 an amount of R3.2 million was received and then a week later on the 25th February 2016 an amount of R2.8 million was received.      So the balance in the safe was R6 million.     Okay.  The page next to it just refers to the persons that received it and then if you flip over to page 586.    Yes sir.    Yes.    Correct.   That is correct.      That would have occurred after the 25th February.    I have another page.    586.    That is a loose page that was in the book, but refers to January 2015 and there you will see delivery to GW, which is the initials of Gavin Watson.    Lindsay – just let me see, collect, which meant that Lindsay Watson would have collected it and checked it.  AVT stands for Andries van Tonder, which means he would have delivered R5.4 million.    Yes.    Alright.  If you look at the bottom you will see, I have calculated it and worked out the balance that was left.  Because this would always be verified with somebody there.  So the balance that was left was R2.185 million afterthere had been payments out.      Okay.  At the bottom of the page next to it you will see that a balance was then R2.6 million.  Unfortunately there is a page in-between that is missing, we do not know where it is.  I never had ownership of these black books, they were always in the safe.    Okay.      That is my record-keeping yes.      Correct.    January 2015 you will see there is a reconciliation there thatsays "received" GLA refers to Greg Lacon-Allin for Gavin.  You will see an amount of R5.4 ...[intervenes]    I am sorry I flipped already to 588 sorry my mistake.     Correct.    It is actually January 2016 sorry.  It looks like a 16 or 15, one of the two I am sorry I did not want to make changes to it.    I write a Fountain pen Your Honour so sometimes I slip.    Yes.    It says on the top there "recon" Chair and I would do that because the book would be left in Gavin Watson's safe.      Reconciliation.    GLA stands for Greg Lacon-Allin for Gavin and ...[intervenes]    GREG LACON-ALLIN [spelt]    Greg Lacon-Allin.   Sorry not a hyphen it is a dash between the Lacon and the Allin.    ALLIN [spelt] if I recall correctly.      Okay.  Then you will see an amount of R5.4 million and the person that reconed [sic] it with me is Andries van Tonder.    No AVT.   Correct.      And the split there is not actually an expense.  What I did was, I used the word "expense" but it was the safes' number one, two and three.    Okay.  May I move on Chair?    R5 487 500.    Yes because there would have been some money left in the safe.    Alright.  So the balance there would be what was currently at that stage in the safe.   Chair if I could ask you to go to page 600.    Correct.    Correct.    600 if you look at it says – and I cannot read the date properlybecause I seem to have lost my glasses here.  But it say "February recon" it says, "received".    The one on the right hand side.    The one on the left denotes the names.    Alright.  The one on the right-hand side says, "received R6 million".    Then there was a reimbursement back to petty-cash for R107.    Then there was some payments, just the totals, not the actual individuals.    Then there was an amount of R3 425 500 left in Gavin's safe which was checked by Lindsay Watson.    We also left a note in the safe that specific time and it was just a note denoting in each safe how much it was in the safe, in the safe.  So that is why I just said, "note left".    Yes.    Yes.  That was Patrick Gillingham Chair.    Yes it is Chair.      Yes.    I think Chair it is just coincidental.  Because if I recall correctly these pages, these specific pages were separate from the book.    Okay.  If you go Chair to page 602.    That just denotes there at the top that there would have been a previous page that said it was checked by three people, Andries van Tonder, Angelo Agrizzi and JVZ stands for Jacques van Zyl.      Okay.      That is right.    What that basically means is the list that you see in front of you and the names that you see in front of you there.    That money was collected by the Director Ishmael.    Yes.      He changed his surname, his surname was Mncwabe and it changed it to Dikani.      Mncwabe, I am going on memory MNCWABE [spelt], Dikani was DIKANI [spelt].    Yes.   Correct.      Correct Chair.      No that is the total.  I need to, I actually did not check that Chair, I must apologise.   I did not check that, but I presume it would be the total.    Because that is how I normally would do it.     Yes unfortunately.    I think Chair that is in response to your question that you asked me.  And then I would like to clarify a point that seems to have come across.    These pages answer about I would say fifty percent.      Yes.    No.    About forty ja.    Ja.    I would say close to that Chair, I would ...[intervenes]    I would have to think about that, I did not do anything about it.    That received illegal cash payments yes.      Unfortunately yes.    Chair the other question, I know there was a question regarding vaults and there was a question ...[intervenes]    I wonder if Advocate Pretorius would just clarify.      It was the minimum balance.    Yes.    Yes correct.    Chair what I can do is, is draw up a schedule.    If Advocate Pretorius requests that I can do that.    Weekly.    Sorry Chair, could I raise the ...[intervenes]    I do not want to interject you.   But I think what is important is that I clear up any misconceptions that might have happened yesterday.    I will.  When you referred to disposal of people, it is a new term in terms of getting rid of people.  I experienced many a time where senior people would have to be dismissed, fired.  But they would go through, there would be a rigorous process of discrediting the person in Social Media, in the Media and also with everybody else possible.  So that is what I meant by 'disposal'.  Because literally you are taking a person's life, their family and you are throwing them in the dustbin.  So that is basically what I was trying to clarify.    And I have seen it over the last years, so many.    Yes.   Discrediting would happen during and after.     Yes.    No.    I did not mean that people be killed.    Yes.    Thank you it is clarified.     Those – the case was Gavin Watson would deal with them himself Chair.      That is correct Chair.    That is correct.  Occasionally, if I say 'occasionally', he would visit the people and do the special payments himself.  At one stage writing – I cannot remember the exact date, I went with, with Mr Watson to do Christmas – what I called the 'Christmas run'.  And you know, at that stage already I said to him, please can you keep detailed records, because you know anything can happen to you and what then?  And he basically made it clear that he just ignored me.  And when I asked him again he basically said, 'I do not use paper, I had being trained to use my memory, I do not writeanything down, I have not signed anything and I have not got a secretary.'  That is basically what was said.    Well I had realised after awhile that people would come to me and says 'Gavin said, please can you organise this for me, can you hire me a car, can you fly me down to PE, can you book my kid in a hotel' and eventually I would not do it and I would actually phone up Mr Watson and say to Mr Watson this person is asking for A, B, C and D, what do you want me to do.    He would tell me and confirm the instruction to me.    I would not do anything without his approval, or his instruction.    Chair the answer is actually very simple.  That I would not do anything without his instruction, without him knowing about it.  Otherwise I could beheld responsible and quite simply I would not take risks, you know not doing something without him knowing about it.  It is too dangerous to try something like that.      He knew the extent, if you look at my response.  I do not think he knew the extent, because there was one specific incident where I – Chair I do not like an untidy office, or an untidy desk and there were papers lying around and I grabbed a refuse bag that was lying there to put the rubbish in.  And in the bag I saw R70 000 and I showed him and I said, you know you need to be more careful.  So I do not think he actually even knew the extent of what he was paying out.      Yes.    Most definitely he told me on numerous occasions that my jobis to make money, his job is to make sure that he spends the money.  To him it meant nothing.    R70 000.      R70 000.    I showed him, it was – well his attitude was, oh well luckily you found it.    No I was hoping he was going to give it to me Chair.    Correct.    There was never any shortages, we made sure.  I always made sure, I would never do it alone, I always made sure there was somebody with me,either Jacques van Zyl or Andries van Tonder or Lindsay Watson with me so that my integrity would not be questioned in that situation.      Yes.    Well Chair there were numerous other favours and there were vehicle repairs being done for people.  There were school fees settled.  There was travel arrangements that were done and it was merely – what happened there was we paid it through the books and that was eventually picked up by the SIU investigation and thereafter the preferred mechanism was using cash, or using it through an arms length company that would be registered as Mr Watson instructed.    Well there were – there is two stances.  The one is an outside garage where they would then invoice Karano or Bosasa the garage and the other one was, we had an onsite workshop at one of our complexes which we had setup to deal with the high volume of vehicles that needed minor services.  So people would take their cars there and they would sort it out.      Correct.    Well the category that we it under it is either the Operational Expense, or alternatively Marketing Expenses and they would normally be allocated to a company where the person who received the benefit gave benefit to.  So if Mr X was from Bosasa security and he was helping Bosasa security, the expense would normally go through that division.      Yes.  I am aware of some vehicles that had being serviced for specific individuals Chair.    This gentleman was the security, I think liaison I could call him at ACSA his name is Reuben Pillay.    Amongst others yes.      Well it would be authorised by Joe Gumede, because Joe Gumede at that stage was in charge of Security.      Both are correct, because he would come to me with it and I would then finalise it and – remember Chair if I can explain.  I signed off everything thatwas the rule.    I had to signoff everything.      Correct.      So to answer the question correctly would be to say that the request to do it was through Joe Gumede.  But the authorisation was through me.      It was in the early, early days when Bosasa received the ACSA contract for the guarding of the multi-storey car level at OR Tambo.   He was involved with it yes, as far as I know.    No was employed by ACSA.      He was employed by ACSA.    Yes I did.    I did.    I have become blunt to it.      Ja the name was Mr Reuben Pillay.    Most definitely.    Yes.    Correct.    That is correct Chair.    One such method Chair was to issue a cash cheque and to cash the cheque at the bank and a fictitious invoice would be created to justify thatcash transaction.  The fictitious invoice would be created in the name of a company that was nearing liquidation or in liquidation, or a company that was about to be placed in liquidation.      Because it would be very little queries or recourse for the cheque.    I do not think they would and I did not do the invoicing so I didnot, I found out about the practice and – but I think they would not have known.    What they would do is, they would raise fake invoices which would be in a small start-up name and there was no VAT numbers, because the last thing is to mess around with Revenue Services.  And companies that had delivered and perhaps a small product or a service, they would just regenerate those invoices.  And you know, they were not used more than once or twice.  But I recall a company called Kgwetlo Events which was ...[intervenes]    Correct yes.  Kgwetlo Events was a company that belonged to a Mr and Ms Brian Gwebu who previously used actually work at the Bosasa Group andwhere they had a hiring of plates and tents and that kind of company.  Then the accountant would draw up the invoices and book it to Kgwetlo Events, which was – I got a bit annoyed because I thought you know it is one of our employees that passed away and it was not a very good thing to do.  But for this reason they used it, was because they could advert any potential queries from the South African Revenue Services, or from the auditors.    Yes companies Chair.      Well the significance of that is these are small companies that have no VAT exposure.  They do not have to do returns as yet and my understanding is that they would not be queried.  When I asked the question, I was told it is because they would not be queried.      No.    The gentleman that drew up – there were various people that drew up the invoices.  The gentleman I know drew up the invoice was Carlos Bonifacio.      Well basically it replaced a system whereby we would write out cash cheques and draw it as casual wages and we would have a – I mean I – look I did not do it, I was not involved with that aspect of it, but I know what was being done.  They would draw up a dummy list of employees and then issue cash cheques accordingly.    He was the Chief Accountant and responsible for the finances of the Group.   Correct.    Yes.    Commission – Chair I would – let me give you a bit of background to it.    That one stage Carlos Bonifacio had know that I was going to whistle-blow and declare everything for quite some time, as did quite a lot of other people as well.  And at one stage he was involved, he would come through to the meeting and write up a statement and would email statements and that type of thing and he was going to cooperate.  As a matter of fact, his wife even phoned me and said thank you for helping us get this clear.  He was in the process of preparing an affidavitfor this purpose of the Commission and also for law enforcement.    Yes, yes.     And he was prepared to come clean and draw up everything.  He forwarded me portions of the draft affidavit.  But then what happened was, he just – he got cold feet and he confessed everything to Gavin Watson who sat with him for three/four hours apparently and he then rattled off exactly who was going to whistle-blow to Gavin Watson and that is what basically happened.    Yes I have.    I have.      Chair there would be companies that we eventually wouldhave to start-up on Gavin Watson's instruction and we would register it and then do exactly the same, but with a fictitious companies closing down, liquidate them after the taxes had been paid and that.  So I think it is kind of addition to 13.3.    Non VAT ja.   Correct.    They were, the files were at Bosasa.  I cannot recall exactly how many, I did not keep track of that at all.  I think ...[intervenes]    I think I can remember five.    I must be honest, I cannot recall.    If the Chair allows I will go and check on my laptop and see if I can get some information from them.    And I will bring them.    Will do.    Yes Chair.  There was another way that the cash was withdrawn and that was via a contractor called Fikile Construction, which is owned by a gentleman by the name of Riaan Hoeksema.  Hoeksema had a very good relationship with a wholesale liquor outlet in Randfontein that does a lot of cash transactions and obviously they had a lot of cash and it cost money to deposit cash, so they would rathergive it away.  Well not give it away, but give it to someone else and receive an EFT it is not so much safer into those times.  So what would happen is ...[intervenes]    Electronic Fund Transfer through the bank.  Does that clarify that?    Okay.    No problem.  So what would happen is that this companycalled Jumbo Liquor would hand the funds over to Mr Hoeksema and at the same time also do an invoice to Bosasa for alcohol, alright.  So alcohol was not purchased, there was no alcohol whatsoever, not even communion wine Chair.  So it was never purchased, it was just cash.    It was never delivered.    It was just specified as an invoice and who would check that the invoice would be delivered?  Nobody would check.  So the cash was transferred and the amount of the invoice was paid and given in cash, instead of the communion wine, or the alcohol or the Coke-Cola or whatever so they specified an invoice.    Yes.  So if I can explain it to you.  I would put in an order for – I am just saying 'I would', I never did the invoice.   They would put in an order for R4 million.  Over a weekend Jumbo Liquor also this, would do R4 million cash.    Correct.    Well obviously the amount was split over time, so maybe using R4 million is not right, maybe let us use 600 or ...[intervenes]    It was not the R4 million, the amount.    I am just giving the amount.    It would be say a million, or R1.2 million at a time.      But over a week or over two weeks it would come to R4/R5 million.    From the same supplier.    Yes.   But as long as the invoices were in sequence and there was not – it did not highlight any concerns from anybody.  So what would happen is, the order would be sent, they would collect up the cash and when it was ready to be delivered, there would be a phone call and payment of an EFT would transfer.  Now the interesting ...[intervenes]    Well it would be – I cannot recall if it was Jacques van Zyl and Riaan Hoeksema, or if it was Andries van Tonder and Riaan Hoeksema.  But they would normally, the standard practice would be, they phone a week – during the week andsay, Gavin Watson needs "X" amount of cash and they would then arrange it.    So what would happen then is that it would be delivered to the offices and that would be the payment, you know in lieu of the – not the living stock, they would deliver the cash for it.  And because of this, the agent, in this case was Riaan Hoeksema would get between 5 percent and 7.5 percent of the fee.    Yes.    Ja.    Maybe a week or two weeks Chair.    No.    Correct.      So what would happen is, well the cash would be delivered and it would follow exactly the same process of going into the first vault and then being transferred to Mr Watson's vault.    What would happen is, they would transfer via an electronic fee.    They paid for the invoice.    And then the invoice would be delivered in cash to Bosasa.      Does it clarify?    Yes.    Correct.      I just want to clarify.    The commission went to Riaan Hoeksema, because he was the agent for Jumbo Liquor.    So he would get the five to seven percent.      Yes.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.  I just ...[intervenes]   That is right.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.   That is correct Chair.      I just need to add Chair, there is one missing link.    The link is, the invoice is put through as "operational expenses" and expensed.      So it becomes tax deductable.    The problem when the initial cash cheques were drawn up is that these were reflected on the bank statements as cash drawings.  Because a cash cheque is cash drawings.  So it looked it very suspicious.  A concern was raised by the auditors and the explanation was given tot he auditors that the payments were made – that were being made were too small and these will start-up companies that Bosasa had to accommodate.  So they would make cash payments to them.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    This is actually a very sad story Chair because at one stage the employees, I am not going to read it off my statement, I know it so well, at one stage the employees were having major problems because they were losing family members through death, natural death, and we then decided that we needed to help the employees and we bought what was called a Metropolitan Death Benefit Fund, which basically covers employees in the event of death with, I think it was R20 000or R10 000 if the main member died, if a child died it was maybe a little bit less and if a mother or a father died it would be a little bit less.  So it was a scheme that I implemented to try and assist.  But then what happened was the death certificates are always delayed, so we would then issue an advance to the person instead of the – instead of waiting for Metropolitan to ...[intervenes].    To actually issue a cheque and verify that the person has got a legitimate death certificate and all that.  So what happened was then a second request was made, so if a family member died they would get two cheques, so that we get the Metropolitan cheque and then they would get a cash cheque, but theynever actually received the cash cheque.  The cash cheque was used to draw cash out the bank for bribed and corruption.  So the second cheque that was written out was not ever given to the family but it was used to pay bribes and to raise cash to be able to do that.  So if anybody was questioned then it would be clearly said to them that no the company contributed because it had all the supporting documentation, so we decided to contribute a double cheque to the person and that is how it would be passed off.    Correct.    Correct.    You have hit the nail on the head Chair.    Correct.    Look the records of the transactions are all kept because these are normal, they appear as normal transactions, and at one stage the estimated monthly total was about R300 000.  I mean we were having a lot of deaths.  We had people in security and ill people so it was quite high one month Iremember specifically.    Look I am not took sure what it is now but at one stage at the peak, especially with all the security contracts with the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, with the Post Office and that, it was up to about 6 000 people.    I do not have a clue of what it is at now.    But it is considerably lower I believe.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I cannot recall Chair, I did not want to even know about this.  I did not even want to sign off these death requests, these death benefits at one stage, so I think people averted from coming to me.  So the last time I recall signing them was in June 2016, so I cannot say.    In June 2016 ja.    Chair, I would like to clarify I am not an accountant.    Okay, and ...[intervenes].    I can just give information.    And this is where it gets concerning, is that when you look at this done by a simple calculation it is quite frightening.    Correct.  Chair if I can take you through a very rough calculation.    Because what you have got to consider as I said you know I am under oath and I do not want to be quoted and give the wrong figures, so what I would like to just explain is that because these costs went through as operational expenses they would dilute your profit margins when you reconcile your books at the end of the day, and obviously company tax would be affected.  So in effect it was defrauding the Revenue Services.   So if you just calculate, if you take R4 million in cash over 12 months, and I just took nine years, it comes to about R432 million.  Of that R432 million, which was absorbed into cost of sales, in effect company tax at 28% gives you R120 960 000 tax evasion.  Now at this stage I cannot give a final figure, they would need to do a full audit on this.    And I would gladly assist.    In the audit process of SARS or the HAWKS or the SAPS or whoever it might be.    Correct.    What happened Chair, if I may explain it in detail and give you the background, we were very involved, when we had bought a company call F & R Phakisa, and it was a repair shop type company, and they had a fuel station in Belfast in Witbank area.  Bosasa would basically collect all the cash that was in the forecourt that motorists would use to pay fuel, for fuel, and Bosasa would then reimburse the fuel station and basically run an account.  So run an account for the cash that was taken, and replace that with an EFT, and this was reflected in theexpenses as well, of Bosasa.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Correct, I just recall the name of the person that was responsible on a daily basis to go and fetch it.    And I will make a note of it and give it to the Commission.    Most definitely Chair.    I do most definitely.    If I can add Chair?    I think that there is a lot of – because of time, we did not have time to put everything in you know.    There is a hell of a lot more that will come out as time goes on.   I have given the documentation that is correct, it is insafekeeping.  It was subpoenaed and it is with the Commission at the moment.    That is correct.    With all the hard drives, yes.    From the Youth Centre to the client.  The client would arrange to sign it off and the client, whoever signed it off and the person that requested the money, the part of the monies would be retained by Bosasa and the youth centre, the other part would be paid in cash to the official.  Now a prime example of this is in the North West Province, and I do, if I recall correctly I do knowthat there was an investigation at one time but I was not privy to it at all.    This occurred about five years ago.    Correct.    I think these are more regional elections so that ...[intervenes].    Unfortunately yes.    No it was one specific political party Chair.   I think it happened quite often over time.    And I am sure it is no secret that there was a reason for that, to support that specific funding of elections and that type of thing.    Yes.    Yes.    In one instance it is owned, the facility, and that is the Mogale Youth Centre Chair.    Correct Chair.    correct.    That is correct.   That is not correct.  What happens is the Department of Social Services and the relevant person responsible there would pay Bosasa for the software.    Correct.    That is correct, it would be paid.    It is the South African or the North West or the Cape Town Department of Social Services and Development.   That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Would be paid to the individual that had requested thefunding.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That was the excuse given to me Chair, by the people who worked at Bosasa Youth Development Centres.    That is correct Chair.   It is definitely not ...[intervenes].    It is definitely not conjecture.  I think Chair, I have made it very clear that I will be totally frank, honest and open.  I will not conjure up anything, and I think that the important part with regards to the – what I was told and what was requested, I can confirm it, that it was Syvion Dlamini from Bosasa that requestedthat I attend a meeting at the – I am giving you one example of the North West.    I would attend a meeting at the stadium that was built in Rustenburg, I cannot recall the name right now but I attended a meeting there and the MEC was present with me.  I cannot recall the name.  At that meeting I was told it is for electioneering and that is why I have made mention of it.    Chair, I do not have the best memory.  My understanding was it was a lady and she was responsible for social development in the North West.    Correct.    That specific meeting that I attended I was asked to attend.  At that meeting the request was made.    Correct.    I cannot recall the lady MEC's name but what I can tell you is that Syvion Dlamini was present and he will recall the persons name because heultimately handled the delivery as well.    Correct.    He is, I believe a director of Bosasa Youth Development Centres.    Yes I do.   I would not, do I have to say it Chair?    My answer to your question is it is the ruling party.    Yes Chair.    Chair, I am sure the investigators can actually perhaps check.    That information with the hotel.    Because I used my credit card there, my company credit card.    And they – please if they can pull my company credit card history.    They will see the hotel.    And where I actually was.    I am going to try and jog my memory.    And try and remember.    It seems to be coming back to me now, there is a couple of stories around it.    That I will jot down and then ask the investigators to look into.    That was my understanding.   Chair one of the ways that there were – it started becoming very prevalent in the North West, was that special pre-opening expenses were levied on youth centres.  Now normally ...[intervenes].    Well a pre-opening expense is normally when you get handed over a facility and you need to buy equipment, S and T, that type of thing.  So you levy an opening expense to be able to afford that.  Now in certain cases the costs of the fencing and security systems that we implemented were highly inflated, so the department paid much more and the agreement was that the person negotiating these payments, Mr Syvion Dlamini, who was a director of the Bosasa Youth Development Centres would actually sort out or pay the people.    Well I do not know who the actual people were but Syvion Dlamini would pay the responsible officials in the department of youth development centres in Government, in social services.  So I would, my – what my level, what I did was I just waited until I saw that what they were telling me was true, that the company was not being defrauded and if they prepared an invoice for R2 million pre-opening expenses I expected it to be paid before they paid anything out.   Yes, the department and Government.    Correct, we the taxpayers paid.    correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well that is what we were told.    That it was the political party.    I just want to clarify one issue is that you must remember that there was a software system that was developed.  It was really, it was developed, it is as good as if I go to your car and I take out your navigation disk and I sell it back to you, that is basically what it was.  The car comes with navigation, why on earth would you now charge for a navigation disk.  So when I mean something was not delivered because there was no additional expense to getting that delivered there.  You were sold a product and you were overcharged for the product in effect.    I cannot answer.    I do not know what they were thinking.    Sorry to use that kind of example.    But that is the truth.    And the software would be there if you wanted to see it.  So Chair, it was there.  So if anybody, if the auditors came to check on it, software is something that you cannot quantify the value of.    correct.   Well Chair, I have alluded to some of the most prevalent mechanisms of handling cash.    There are some more coming through but the most important thing was these were always reflected as run of the mill costs.  So if you look at the percentage in relation to turnover it is really a drop in the ocean.  Because what happens is if you take for instance the R4.5 million that is required outof one contract, let us take the average purchases and salaries of Bosasa and amounted to let us say, this is excluding, sorry it should be excluding salaries and wages, it would amount to R88 million per month.  Now if you take R4.5 million and divide that just into R88 million, it is a minuscule amount, it is 5.5%.Now bearing in mind that the profit margins at Bosasa are exceptionally high industry related, if you comparative to industry it is unique, we are always able to make exceptionally good profits as a company.  And so if you look at it in the profit terms, your profits would still reflect 28 to 35% nett profit before tax even after you have paid out R4.5 million through the books, why would an auditor query that, it is a well run business.  So in actual fact if I can just go back there, the profit should havereflected say 32 or 33 or 34% but they were reflecting 28 to 23%.So the auditors were amazed, they were happy and anybody would be happy, as a shareholder as well, with that kind of return on investment.  So it did not raise eyebrows at all.  The main reason for this is because of the good pricing we were able to negotiate with for instance correctional services, the extensions we were able to get, so that facilitated that to a large degree.  And then November, December when it was Christmas shopping time, and obviously you would use more cash because more cash would be requested by Gavin Watson, the 2 or 3% fluctuation there would really be explained as a public holiday or expenses over a public holiday.So the whole idea was to show the auditors and the submission of tenders, the bid adjudication committees, if they looked at our numbers and they did an analysis, was to show a smooth graph.  You see if you had – it you had it – if it was consistent every month it was fine but as soon as you have a spike that is when it attracted attention.  Now the way we managed it, it would be very, very difficult foran auditor, even a forensic auditor to actually pick it up unless you knew the system itself.    Public holiday costs would be your overtime costs really but what people forget as well is that over public holidays you have certain savings, so people do not do as many visits and all that so it actually really balances out Chair.  What happens is that if you have a query on why did your costs go up over December by 3% so your margins and your profit drop down to 25% where they should be 28, the argument would quite simply be given well it was public holidays,we spoilt the people, we gave them braai's, braai packs, that type of thing, it could be easily explained.    I would like to verify that because you know I have not been there for so many years but my recollection is that that is excluding.    Correct.    Yes.    Chair the transaction, if I recall or try and recall correctly, was about R3.4 million.    Okay.    If I can clarify as well.    Of the R3.4 million I think the cash paid out to the individual was about 1.8 million.    I cannot recall the exact number.    Chair, we at one stage had a very closed community at Lindela so nobody could really go out and buy out and that, and one thing about undocumented migrants is they retain their money and they keep their money so at any one stage you would have up to 800 to R1 million in safekeeping for them.  Butthe one thing that they do want to do is to buy additional foods and groceries at the canteens, which we managed and ran as well.  So they would like to spend cash for that.  Now these were very well priced comparatively and that, but the average takings would be about 300 000 and it went up, it sometimes ...[intervenes].    Sorry I did not hear that?    Correct.    Well over, 300, 350, sometimes even R400 000.   Per month yes.    Alright, but this could not all be reflected as revenue so what would happen is the grocery items would be expensed, the cost of sales, in the cost of sales and the cash would be taken over to Gavin Watson's safe with a small amount being declared as revenue, maybe 10 or 15% of the actual.  So that was one way of generating cash.  It was not a big way, this was – this only happened in early 00 and then the cash requirements became much greater with the correctional services contracts and all the other contracts.The other method was the use of these prepaid cell phones.  So detainees were purposefully not allowed to take their cell phones into the facility and they would have to use cell phones that were fixed lines that were in a store kind of pay as you go type environment where they could then phone from there.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair if I may just give you the history, we used to manage numerous mining hostel, in the mining hostel days, and we would have bars and canteens there, which were actually very lucrative, and only a certain amount of those cash takings would actually be declared for revenue purposes.  Exactly the same as Lindela, this would be expensed through the company and the money would be collected.  As a matter of fact we had a special CIT team, they were called cash in transit team that would go and collect the monies from the various facilities and then bring it back to Gavin's vault, and there was one person allocated to count it and to put it in the safe and administrate it.   Correct.    Well Chair this practice dwindled in 2003, 2004 I think it was, when Bosasa sold off the mining contracts.  It might have been 2002, 2003, I am not 100% sure but we sold off the mining contracts at that stage, to a gentleman by the name of Gregg Lacon-Allin, and that was with Equality Foods.  So they sold itoff and needed to go with those contracts.  It happened up until then.    Yes.    Well as a result of the cash bars and the canteens and that being sold off as part of the mining contract, so special arrangements were then made to sustain the cash income to be able to use to pay out.  And that is when – and we mentioned it earlier, we actually resorted to writing out casual wages because at that time there as also a lot of building work taking place.  I was in the process of renovating the offices and extending and doing quite a lot of buildingwork.  So the people in the accounts took advantage of that and processed casual wage through there, and issues out cash cheques.  And obviously you know, no work was done for the – there were ten people working, 100 people would be invoiced out as casual workers.    Yes.    Well there were two facilities at the time and one of themwas being redeveloped for a halfway house for trial awaiting children, the other one was being redeveloped for a reintegration facility and basically there was a lot of work that took place there.  So we would invoice out, or not invoiced out but we would pay casual wages to ghost workers out there, for those facilities  And at that stage it could be attributed to the work was actually being done there by the builders as well.  So the chances are that it would be picked up by the revenue services was very, very slim.  Does that answer your question?    Chair, I was a bit concerned about the practice because it was extremely risky.  I knew what they were doing, I knew how they were doing it and I was concerned.  So specifically [indistinct] why I was concerned was because there was a junior lady that would go and do it, with one of the gentlemen.  And why I was concerned was because people are killed for much less money.  So how doyou on earth allow a lady to transport or carry this amount of money around, so I went with them to see now how do they do it so I could understand it for myself.  And so they would make up three cheques and they would go to the bank, phone the bank first and say look we are coming.  They go to the bulk teller and so I wanted to understand the process that was being followed to draw the cash as well.    Correct.  Correct.  So the total, I went with them, was R720 000, which they would have to pack in a bag and they would actually carry out the bag out of the bank.  I thought it was ridiculous, and eventually I asked them tostop it because it was just too dangerous.    I think it was [indistinct] 2003 Chair, that the Department of Labour brought in a ruling that Workman's Compensation and UIF would be paid even for casual labour.  I cannot remember the exact date but I do remember that, and because of that we stopped it immediately because it would – you would have to pay the UIF on top of the salary and wages as well, and you were paying to a fictitious person.    Correct.    Correct.   Correct.  Correct, I do.    Correct.    That is right.   Okay so up until 2002 we would have the occasional ghost workers, yes we would.  I mean that we had but most importantly was we had sold off the bars and canteens and the only other way to get cash was through casual wages.  But then what happened was UIF clicked in, and we decided then we cannot continue with that, and that is why it was stopped, with regards to casual.  And also bear in mind that now we were talking getting up 2004 when correctional services would need cash, and that was a hungry animal to feed every month.  So – and that is why we then changed systems and brought in new systems.    I cannot remember exactly.    Okay.    No, less than half the time.  Are you talking about – sorry I am not understanding what Adv Pretorius is wanting to say?    Correct.    Correct.    I must be very frank with you Chair, is that it is a long time ago, it is 15 years, 16 years ago, I cannot remember exactly and I did not write my affidavit in terms of making sure that these dates ...[intervenes].    So I did not want to collude anything.    I had limited time, I wrote the affidavit.    So there will be errors with dates.    But ...[intervenes].    The point is this is who it happened.    No.    No , it was ...[intervenes].    I think it was about six months or a year, I cannot remember exactly.    The person – you see Chair, I did not actually do this.    I am reporting on it because I know about it.    But I did not actually physically do it.    So the person that is going to report on it ...[intervenes].    And I am sure you will call him as a witness, will be able to give the detail on that.    Yes.    Six months.    Correct.   Early in 2000.    Correct.    I do recall it.    Eventually Chair, if I may respond, the large amounts of cash via Jumbo just were becoming somewhat obvious to the accounting principles and the accounting general staff because the general staff themselves would say well, we know that is one person that enjoys expensive whisky in the company, but there is no ways he can drink this amount of whisky, so anybody with a little bit of experience would see that it is impossible.  This is not true, so further than the fact that we did not actually use liquor, apart from the occasional grape juice for communion and we did not need a relationship with Jumbo, because this was now starting to become a concern, so hence Jacques van Zyl then approached me about changing the methodology and they thought through it as a team as from the accounts team and theyapproached me and the fact – matter of the fact is, I actually did not want to get involved at first.  I kind of shunned the idea because I just felt that you know it was getting at the stage where I was getting a bit fed up of all of this and he then – I told him.  I said to him, ‘look I do not really want to know.  You approach Gavin Watson with the idea of utilising an existing supplier that was supplying chicken.  Frozen chicken portions to the relevant catering operations on a national basis.    The whole idea in the concept was that he could trade.  He also had other businesses, which were cash generating.  I believe some of them on the cigarette trade.  Some of them on the alcohol trade and some in the betting industry, so they then approached and they said well, they want to run with it.  They want to coordinate it, because if they do it, then they know it is safe and it will stand up to scrutiny, so I just – I left it, because I though well, you know what, if you guys are controlling it, you are accountants, you are the clever people, you will be able to manager it.  So I let them go ahead and do it and also Gavin just, you know, let themhand it completely.  So, one thing that Gavin Watson did say was that I would have to remunerate them in cash as a bonus to all of them and we all know why, because he needed to raise the living standing so that these people continued to be subservient and just continue to do the work and so, I would have to give them R10 000 a month and those were Jacques van Zyl, Karin Dobert, Rieka Hundermart and the Chief Accountant Carlos Bonifacio.    Okay.     If I remember correctly, it was I think, 37.    It would be and I stand to correction, but I think I am pretty accurate.  They were probably in region of about 210 tons of poultry a month.    Yes I was.    That is correct.  If I can clarify, I was not happy about it.    I allowed it, because myself and Greg Lacon-Allin had worked previously together and I found him to be, you know a little bit untrustworthy and I just was not comfortable.  That is why I said they have to control it.    Yes.    Correct.      In 18.3 there was one person who would have to manipulate the system which is a Microsoft accounting system called Great Plains and he would get R20 000 because he would have to manipulate the stockholdings and things like that behind the scenes so that it would not be obvious to the auditors.    That is correct.    My knowledge comes from running the business and I would make sure that I knew every aspect of that business and I was integrally involved.  I am a committed operations person and I like to be on the floor, involved with the people so that is where I got a lot of my information from and though I did not order or arrange thecash, I was well aware of the process used and the payments made.    Sorry, I had made it a point of every aspect of the business I would know.    Chair, the correct process would be there would be a normaldelivery of goods to a sight.  Let us use Westville Medium A as an example.  So Westville Medium A, the supervisor there is Jonas and the storeman there is Caiphas, so Jonas and Caiphas would work out what the requirements would be for the new system.  Is this what you wanting me to explain?    Okay.    They actually are the names.    I cannot recall the surnames sir.    It was a few years ago.    Yes. Yes, so they would write out a purchase order.  They would send the purchase order to the supplier via fax or email and it is a properpurchase order and on the purchase order, they would specify the price according to the buying manual which had been issued to them.  So there are two comparative things.  It is the price and the buying manual and both of those have to be looked at before they place an order.  They will also have to do their planning for the week and say well, we know we are going to use X amount of chicken and how they would calculate that is by taking the specification on the spread sheets, which will say 200 gram of chicken x by 1 000 people, so they knew that they would have to order 200 kilograms of chicken to feed 1 000 people 200 gram portions.  That would be placed with the supplier.  The supplier would then deliver it.  So let us say the supplier delivered on 1 December, supplier would deliver then we go into store.  The stock – thestoreroom manager would basically sign and stamp the order coming in and the storeman would be countersigned by the unit leader who would also sign and stamp that the units were delivered and that they were placed on the bin cards.  The system would then be that they would capture the invoice and that invoice would then be sent through to head office a week or two later for payment by the end of the month with the statement, if the agreement was 30 days from statement, by the end of next month.    By Bosasa.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    The fraudulent system Chair was that an invoice would be sent to Bosasa.  No purchase order.  The invoice would be sent to Bosasa head office.      Just the invoice and the head office would get the invoice and make payment.  Is that not nice.    None.  No goods are delivered yet.    No.  Not at all.  What happened was.  The invoice was sent and this is where the investigators need to look, because normally you would wait 30 days from statement.  Here you were prepaying invoices.  The other thing is the investigators need to understand that there were certain items that were on that invoice and you talking 6 million a month, so you can imagine for yourself there were certain items that reflect zero rated, items that are never ever used in a prison, which were rice, beans and there were various other non-zero rated items that are not used in a prison.  We do not feed beans.  We definitely do not feed rice in correctional centres, but because those were non VAT items, they were utilises.    Correct.    Correct.    That is true.    Totally fictitious.    Normally what we negotiated with all suppliers, including the same supplier is that payment is 30 days ex-statement.  So remember, you receive goods on 1 December.  Payment is only on 30 February – Oh sorry 25 or 26 February, because it is January to get the invoices together and then February and then we make payment.  So in the instance of these fraudulent invoices, they are not stamped and they are pre-paid, which is very strange.    Correct.    Cash.    From Equality Foods.  They would deliver the cash.    There was  deduction.  I cannot remember if it was 12 or if it 15 percent as a commission that they would take as well.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    It is Equal Trade (Pty) Ltd as far as I can recall.    Correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Well a lot of these were not standard stock items, but that is where one of the errors were later on.  So in terms to avoid SARS scrutiny, those are the items that you can use that are non Vatable, so SARS when they see a non Vatable invoice, they do not even bother.  They just pass it on.    Correct.  I would assist them in finding the errors and showing them where it is picked up.    Most definitely, if you do not know what you looking for.    It can be done quite easily.   Yes  I would.    Will do.    Yes.  I will do as I am told.    Alright.  The original introduction to A; A Wholesalers was withPiet Venter who was an accountant ...[intervenes].   No I will not.  I said I would do as I am told.     Yes and basically the introduction with Piet Venter was with Andries van Tonder.  We had a second meeting where Gavin Watson was present and Andries van Tonder and we actually met at the facility in Lenasia.  It is a lovely facility that has got a lot of fridges and mattresses and massive, massive facility and they do a lot of exporting of goods.  At that stage we wanted to buy a company that would produce a lot of cash, so we it would have to be in the retail space and preferablyEFMC and we looked at this facility and it was decided that we could work with them but to do an acquisition on that side of the facility was just really not viable and because there was a major culture difference between the two.So the only potential work that we could work with, with them was we could work out how much cash they collected on a weekly basis which Mr Venter knew and we could then offer them a cheque for goods purchased.  These goods would be invoiced exactly the same as all the others as mattresses, because they manufactured them, plastic chairs, for Lindela, dishes for Lindela, that time of thing.  So that is what the relationship were then was.  Certain of the transactions were actually legitimate and others were just inflated to ensure that the overpayments could come through to us as balances and could come to us at Bosasa as cash.  So in all these schemes, one thing I must mention is that Gavin did not want the directors to initially know that we were embarking on these schemes and then later on they found out.  So we would embark on it, do it and then the directors would be told, but not before.  Does that cover your...[intervenes].    They were very little.    So Chair if they ...[intervenes].   If they charged us for one mattress R2 000, they would deliver on the invoice 40 mattresses of which we only received one.    Exactly.  Like all the other transactions.     Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Well he was auditing us at that stage and he was working with taxes and that type of thing and then what happened was, we had not a close relationship, but a business relationship and he specifically – Sorry.  Are you specifically referring to November?    So in November, he was aware that there was disruption within the group Bosasa and he wanted to follow suit with the other whistle blowers and report what he had done wrong in the whole process.  What then ensued was a meeting with myself and the other whistle blowers.  At one stage we were up to about 22 of them that had all contacted me to come and whistle blow.  He had the meeting with me and he commenced working on his statement, so he was allowed to use a facility that I had provided and he was working on his statement and he wrote up a full statement, however midway during 2017 in November, I cannot remember the exact date, he had completed his statement but he had decided he is no longer going to whistle blow because he had been offered a substantial amount of money by Gavin Watson to – Not to whistle blow and there was a meeting and there was something about putting his hand on the Bible and swearing before the Almighty that he would not whistle-blow and he has not signed his statement.  So we left him.  We had given him the opportunity to join a larger group which made it more effective.   1. in terms of being attacked and being threatened; and 2. it was an opportunity to come clean.So he wrote his statement and he just never came back.  What then happened was – And he then got cornered, put in a corner by Mr Watson and Mr Watson convinced him over a period of four hours that that was not the way to go and he then called Mr van Tonder and said that he is not whistle-blowing anymore, purely because he is being – He does not know where the money is going to come from and where he is going to live from. Mr Watson then had him on his side and then during December, Mr van Tonder and myself received a call, ‘please guys, can I meet with you before I got away on holiday.’  So I said to him, you are more than welcome.  I have nothing to hide,but you definitely not meeting me alone.  You are going to meet me with somebody else and at that meeting which was – I think it was about the 10th or the 7th December, we actually – He then turned around and said that he would like to re-join us and my words to him were very clear.  I said to him – I said you do not appear to understand what your issue is, but I cannot guarantee you finances, because I had been looking after like 20 families already.  I had been supporting them.  I had been feeding them.  I cannot come and give you money, but if you want to come clean and you believe in your heart that it is the right thing to do, then you will do your statement and I left it at that.    Andries van Tonder was at that meeting.  The meeting was held at a – because I was on my way to go buy some chicken pies.  At the Chicken Pie    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair and I would like to add there [Intervenes].    At that time as well, there were rumours going around that I had forced him to make a statement.    At that stage he was in Mossel Bay on holiday.  I was in Dainfern.    I do.    That is correct.   Correct.  I am there.    Yes I do.    That is his signature.    It is his signature.    Correct.    He was in Mossel Bay I think he mentioned or George.  Close by.    Correct.    Correct.      Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    I was in Dainfern.    Sorry.  Can I clarify.    Dainfern in Four Ways and on that specific day on 18 December, I was actually – I can actually get witnesses that witness that I was actually alongside the pool with – having a braai with my brother.    In Gauteng.    Unfortunately yes.    Chair, if I can add, I think I only received it early January.  I was not interest.  Actually I got missed calls from the gentleman, but I cannot remember exactly when I received it.    I only see the dates – I had an unsigned copy, but I see the dates in front of me now.    I cannot offer any comment on that.    I have no clue where he lives.  I know from the affidavit, that itis in Noordheuwel.    No, I would not know.    I did Chair.    Those files were initially all submitted to the attorney who dealt with the matter in the beginning and are still with him at the moment.    Correct.    Yes I do.    Chair, he requested that I send him a copy – email him a copy of the structure of the way that the affidavit were done by Andries van Tonder.    I did so.    It is similar, but there are some difference, I cannot recall exactly what the difference are.    It was an email address.  If I recall correctly, it was petv1972@gmail.com.      No, this affidavit, he was in Krugersdorp at the time.  This was done in November that he asked me to do this.  Send it to him.  It was early November.  Probably around 6 November 2017.    I will do so.   I cannot comment on that.    I cannot comment on that?    I cannot comment on paragraph 2’s comments at all.    I cannot comment on paragraph 2.  In terms of paragraph 4, I cannot comment.      I can comment on that.  That is correct.  I saw them numerous times at the diner together, having lunch and they seem to get on pretty well.      I do not know if that is true.    Yes, he was a tax consultant.  He did our taxes.  My personal tax that he did as well, because Gavin Watson insisted on that and I know that he also consulted to various other people in the group.    Yes.  Gavin Watson trusted him.    That is true.   That is true.    Probably relating to or from 2011 or around there 2010.  I cannot recall exact dates.    Well Patrick Gillingham was not employed at Correctional Services, but he was employed at BEE Foods which is owned by Gavin’s brother in law.     It think the date was 2009.    If I recall.    Well not – No that would not be correct.  It is not within the Bosasa Group, it was within BEE Foods, but it was not with Gavin Watson, with Gavin Watson’s brother in law.    That is correct.    That is correct.    If I am not mistaken, I also cannot recall exactly but  it would have been the same time as Gillingham which, if I recall correctly, it was 2009 Chair.    That is correct.    Correct.   That is correct.  It has been a practice for many years.    I do not know the details, but I have seen the proof and the payments made.     That is correct.    I have submitted everything to the Commission in digital format, but the printed copies are with my erstwhile Attorneys.      Yes I have.    I just want to clarify for the Chair that I would not have attached this affidavit if there was any untruths or anything not clear in this affidavit backed up by proof.  Everything was there.   It does reflect that.    Chair, he used to work for me.  He was previously a social worker that worked for with the youth centres.  He then got promoted to a Director of Bosasa Youth Development Centres.    All I know is, I saw the transaction and I was told by Mr Venter that it was not anything else but money laundering to get money to somebody.  No services were provided.    I saw a record of the transaction in terms of an agreement that was drawn up for consultancy services to Moroko and then the payments to Moroko.    Yes I did.    It was not a genuine agreement.  It was just a smoke screen.    Correct.    I do.   Chair, Miotto is just a shelf company owned by Mr Venter and I think his sister Ms Longsworth who is also the owner or the shareholder in Consilium.    That is correct.    I have seen the proof of payments attached, except the proof of payment for the end of November 2017, because obviously this agreement or this affidavit was written before the end of November 2017    I saw the payments at the time that Mr Venter submitted his Annexures with his affidavit.    The affidavit goes further to – Sorry I must take a step back.  The proof of payments – that documentation – has it suffered the same fate as the other documentation you referred to, it is with your erstwhile Attorneys.    Unfortunately.    I recall seeing it and being explained that it was nothing but a farce.    That is true Chair.  It was a regular occurrence.  It will not be the first house that we purchased for Ms Lindie Gouws.   Ms Lindie  Gouws used to work at Bosasa and then had to leave and started a ministry of sorts called My World Ministries and is a very close, close associate of Mr Watson.    Yes it was.    I do.  We would normally draw up a loan agreement to avert donations tax.    Probably a deposit.    Yes I am aware of the property that she purchased.  That was probably a deposit.   Mr Venter showed me the documentation and it was a property in – look I do not like to give out addresses and that.    I do not want to do that.  But it was a property on the Hilltop overlooking Roodepoort.      Oh yes.    If I recall correctly and I stand to correction, she had a property previously in the same complex and I think she mentioned to me once that she sold it for, I think R5.5 million.    But it was in the same complex.    So I do not know.  Look I do not have the details of what that transaction were.    So I do not want to really assume anything.    I have not seen any documentation that Gavin Watson told him to that, but knowing Gavin Watson that is probably correct and he did show me there is proof the transfer into Miotto's bank account from Gavin Watson.     Most definitely not.      One did not challenge Gavin Watson, you just do not challenge him.    He will destroy you.    I do.     Personally I did not want to get involved in it because I,number one did not believe it.  I thought, you know it just cannot happen, this type of transaction.  But he showed me a transfer into that account and that I saw, that is all I saw.      I was made aware of it that if you Google Petrus Stephanus Venter, apparently it is him, or someone else put in the public domain.    Correct.    No I did not.   Correct.    I know that she realised that this came to the attention of other people.      I have not got a clue, I was not following up.  It was not something that really interested me.    I did not show any interest.    All I can say is, the only truth thing that I know about is that she is paranoid and he mentions she was paranoid about, that is all I can mention.      Correct.      Chair I was not interested in that, I was shocked with it and I did not want to actually get involved with it.    That is why I averted my attention from it.   The main reason I attached Peet Venter's affidavit in my statement is not to go at the President or the President's son, but to refer to the tax evasion that concerned me.      That was public knowledge on the internet.    I have not got a clue.   I have seen this, but I did not pay much attention to it, I was not interested.    It is just very expensive, but no I do not.     I know what I had being told.    Well number one is; the proof I have seen I can attest to that.  I can attest that where it refers to a payment, where it refers to a transaction, a bond transaction, the discussion for a refund with the transferring attorneys I can attest to the fact that those documentations are in his file.  But I cannot attest – I cannot agree to the statement that I would have forced him to make an affidavit.  He did the affidavit of his own, six or seven other people were there to see him write the affidavit himself and attach whichever Annexures he felt suitable in the venue which I had offered up to all the whistle-blowers to use.  So he was seen by numerous people doing his own affidavit.  And specifically for that reason I would not involved, I would stay away from him and I was probably dealing with somebody else just as them.  So I take exception to the fact that they would say that that I would coerce him to do this.  I would not even know this information.         Exactly.     We had a dustbin with the name on it.      He did not do what he was told to do, he would – Venter would have a dustbin with the name of it.    As I mentioned earlier.    Honourable Chair I can tell you now that there are probably about hundreds such examples out there.      I prefer not to comment on that if the Chair agrees.    Thank you Chair.    That is correct.    I attended a meeting at one stage with Brian Biebuyck and I think Advocate Manny Fitz or Attorney Daniel Fitz was present where we were told that Gavin Watson had made a statement and we spoke out.  He had already made his statement, so a two page statement with Graham Richards.  I do not know what was in the statement, I never read it, but he was going to use that to implicate us.    Some of it.    I do not know this actual transaction, other than what I have read and what I had been told, and that is what I was told.    Yes every month.      Yes Chair I made deliveries sometimes myself.   Yes that is correct it is 110 000.    It actually does.    No I would not.    Chair that – yes it was pretty much the practice.      I recall him phoning me about it and telling me how upset he was and that he had been brought into this whole thing.  That is all Chair.    I do not know anything about it, other than I see and I was told, but I can believe it.    No.    No Chair, but I can believe the credibility of that.    I am aware of the facts, I am aware of the youngster.  I tried to rehabilitate him at one stage, I took him under my wing.  But I was not aware that he had the criminal convictions that he had.  But I can believe it.      No I cannot comment on that.  I was not present.  I only see what I was told.      That is correct.    Ja.  Chair I do, SeaArk was an agricultural project that Gavin Watson embarked on, it was a Maverick project.  It would cost the company dearly.  I think the cost was about R400 million and never was it successful.    That is a fact.      Correct.    No.    This one was a project that was – we were approached by an American to-do, to grow prawns in the Coega Eastern Cape Development Zone.      Most definitely.    Yes I am aware of it.      Yes.    Well I am definitely not a tax expert let alone an accountant.  But basically Chair what was being done was that the – if you changed the structure and the purpose the intent of a business, you are able then to change the name and utilise it for something else.  So with that tax loss for instance, what they would do was they would use that tax loss and have a company called Pasanno Supply Chain Management, which was SeaArk trading as Pasanno's Supply Chain Management.  Then Bosasa Supply Chain Management would buy from suppliers and on sell those goods at a much higher price than market related to the operational company Bosasa.  So the profits would reside in Bosasa Supply Chain Management.  Now if the profits reside in Bosasa Supply Chain Management, you will show losses in the othercompanies.  Because now what you have done is you hike the prices up in Bosasa Supply Chain Management and you are making good profits.  So you make-up to 50, 60, 70 percent profits now all of a sudden in Bosasa Supply Chain Management, which suits the situation that you have a tax loss in there.  So eventually you will use up your tax loss and then you would have to start paying tax.  But that is basically the way it was structured, how I understood it at least.    Well I asked Peet Venter on the phone once upon a time whenhe phoned me about this and I asked him, is it actually fraudulent and he said to me, yes it is and he then said, but we have to create invoices and manufacture fraudulent invoices to win the SARS investigation over.  Now you will remember that he was from SARS and there was other people there from SARS as well that assisted in the process.  But he would – he knew what to do to make it acceptable to SARS to be able to grant the assessed tax loss for the future tax years.  So that is how I understood it.  I must confess I am not a tax specialist and I did not get involved with the nitty-gritty at all.      Chair yes with Peet Venter, but also with other colleagues and people.  I would always check up on people and ask what the situation was.    That is correct, I checked out on that.    Correct.    That is correct.    I saw the affidavits that were attached to his – not affidavits, the statements that were made to SARS attached to some of the whistle-blowers' statements.    Correct they were signed by the company’s secretary – I am not sure it was the company’s secretary or the Commissioner of Oaths within the company.   Correct.    Most definitely.  It looks like they were drawn up by one of the Charter Accountants.    That is correct.    Chair, I was not concerned with the tax matters of the company.  My responsibility was to make sure that we have a well run organisation in terms of operations.  I had to make sure that there would never ever be a complaint or for the services we offered.  That was my job.  In terms of the tax matters and that, that was handled by people like Colleen Pasanno, Louis Pasanno and Andries van Tonder, Carlos Bonifacio.  I had nothing to do with the tax matters.    That is correct.    I do.    That would be standard practice.    There are.    It is not a company.  It is just  the name of a facility.  It is old mining hostels that were transformed into businesses at first.  It was for a prawn farm and then it was transformed again to a copper plant.    It is owned by Bosasa Properties (Pty) Ltd.  All the propertiesare in Bosasa Properties (Pty) Ltd.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.   Correct.    Generally it would occur Chair, but you have not seen any books in relation to the capitalisation or deduction in operating expenses in relation to this particular transaction.    In terms of this transaction Chair, the only thing I know is that at one stage there was a debate on the over expenditure at Lindela and that is when I personally knew that a lot of these costs had been through the company.  That is the first really -  That is when I really got involved.    It is true and Peter Reicher had a dustbin with his name on it.    Chair, he was dismissed and I believe he is now staying in Australia.    I cannot really comment on that Chair.  I do not understand the transferring of the houses or the costs for the houses and what the impact would be on the tax.  I am not too sure.  So I cannot – I know about it, but I cannot comment on it.  I know about it.    No.  I could not do that.  No.    Now, that is fact.  I was aware of that Chair.    Yes.    I am aware of that.    Chair it is true.  Over and above the R110 000 per month,Gillingham needed to show some sort of income that was not cash and there was a R65 000 per month and he received a company car, GLA 200.  The full costs of that was added to the BEE invoicing as – and just deducted again.    Correct.   Yes he was.    While he was in the employ, it was R47 000 per month as far as I remember and when he was not in the employ, he would get R110 000 per month.    Correct.    That is right.  It is a fleet management company.    Chair, I cannot make allegations here.  At the end of the day, it was Watson’s money alone and he could do with it what he wanted I suppose, but these are the transactions that happened.  I have seen them.  I have verified them.  I checked up myself before I even looked at this statement in its entirety.   What happened was, you had agreements between Anewco for Lamozest which was an arms-length company.  It was not owned by any of the Bosasa companies and what would happen is, that company would have agreements for software development with the various other entities within the Bosasa Group and what that does is, there is no costs involved there for Lamozest.  It just strips all the profits out of all the other entities.  So even if you had boni fide shareholders, they would never see the dividends because all the profits would be stripped off byLamozest through agreements for software and provision of software and that type of thing, so it was all a bit of – Part a bit of fronting.  At the end of the day, the Shareholders in any other group would not have gotten money anyway, because it was all being moved out into Lamozest.     They are correct.    I checked up on it and it is correct?    Ja.    The facts are correct, but I cannot really comment on the – I am not geared to understand these type of balance sheet transactions.    You are hundred percent correct.    That is correct.    Then why would he have signed it Chair.  Why would he havesigned it if I had forced him to write it.    I most definitely did not.    I will not know what they would say.    I can believe that.   That is right Chair.    Correct.    Well we have gotten into a four chair, I believe sir.   1. Is Mr Venter wrote his own statement in a facility that I allowed him to use.  He wrote on his own computer and there are 5/6, maybe even 7 people that can attest to it that he sat on his own and did it by himself.  Nobody assisted him at all.   2. The second thing I would like to raise is, it is amazing how Mr Venter first wanted to whistle-blow and then did not want to whistle-blow and then came back and asked to whistle-blow and that is when we said to him, look if youwant to whistle-blow then you need to put skin on the table and you need to sign your affidavit and we will help you.  I will help you as far as I can to support you with legal costs and all that type of thing where we can, so that we can clear this thing up and he made use of that opportunity and then in January he turns again.  It just does not make sense to me.   Does that answer the question Mr Chair.    Chair I have – I cannot even answer that because I do not know what he realises.  I mean ...[intervenes]    He might have been scared of the dog in my house would bite him maybe, but definitely not – there was nothing that I could use and by the way thedog is aground, so she does not have many teeth left either, but what I am saying is Mr Chair is that there is no ways I could have forced him into doing anything.  He did not even work with me or for me.  He came to us and he said look, he cannot continue like this anymore, but he quickly changed his tune when he was offered a couple a hundred thousand rand because he came to me and he asked me the first time round, he says, can you afford to pay me R300 000 a month and I said I do not even do that myself.  So, one needs to look at his motives.    That is correct.    Very shaky Chair.    Honourable Chair, for me to make them up, would be ludicrous.  I would not know where to start.    This is the same person Chair.    Chair, as far as I know, he had the statement with him and he – Even if I look at the date that he apparently signed it on where it is dated in typo 19 July.  Even if I try to do the statement, how on earth, would I have predicted he would have signed off on 18 July, 18th of – I cannot remember ...[intervenes]    18 December, where he signed – where he puts there 19 December.  I mean, I would not have known these things.  I would not have known where he is on holiday.  I would not have known which police station to meet him at. You can look at my travel records.  I was nowhere near Mossel Bay or George.    Oh.    No,    The one ...[intervenes]CHAIRPERSON   Okay.  That one belongs to Carlos Bonifacio.  I did read it.  I did go through some of it and it is ...[intervenes]    Yes there is collaboration between the two.   Nope.  I have not had any allegations like that Chair.    If I can respond to you Chair that on paragraph 31, I am aware of it because I have read, but I do not understand the intention behind, but what I fail to understand is that why, if you reviewing Shareholders structures, you would normally involve all the Shareholders.  Why only three were involved – two were involved.    Not at all.    Chair, I did have this in my possession at one time, because this was part of the agreement that was drawn up and they wanted to front.  I had this in my possession – sorry.    Most definitely not.    Well he is still keeping it under wraps, so he is benefitting.    Well, yes.  Even if it was a holiday somewhere, one benefitted from it.  You did.    I think one must be blunt about it.  If you benefit, you benefit.    Not at all.      That is a fact.  That is what happened.  It was before the SIU wanted to come and get information and there was a suspicious data crash.    Chief ...[intervenes]    Well in relation to the SIU investigation, it would have thenbeen 2008/2009 maybe 2007.  I need to – probably it was around the 2009 period, if I remember correctly.    Correct.    Well basically Chair, what we did was, we tendered our assistance to the SIU.  We then called for a meeting with SIU which was conducted in Maisels’ Chambers on the 7th floor.  It was just opposite Advocate Laurence Hode’s offices who was handling the matter and basically there they gave us a list of items thatthey want to mirror on the server and luckily the list was not that great, so we could say to them, it was not problem, they could come in the following couple days to mirror the images.    Correct.  It would be an orchestrated – a month or two months before, was a full data crash of the server thinking that the SIU would not pick up anything.  I think the SIU was a bit brighter than our IT guys and although they crashed the system, they were able to get information off the system.    The purpose of the crash would be to get rid of any potentially harmful or hazardous information that was on the system that we might not have picked up.  That was the reason.    Now you asking once more Chair, I am not a computer expert.  All I know is a crash and then we have a computer expert next to us, but a crash is when the system does not work anymore and you stuck.    Well it is erased, but is not actually erased I believe, because it is kept in some folders, hidden away somewhere and there are means to recover it.    Correct.    I know of what is being put before me by Peet Venter in thisaffidavit when he did deliver it to me.  My understanding is that the second crash is planned in November 2017 when they heard that people were going to whistle blow.  That is my understanding.    I really would not know.  I am sorry.    Yes.  I was aware of it.  Somebody had taken a screen shot.  One of the potential whistle-blowers had taken a screen shot of the computer screen where this memo came up on because they were too scared to send it on normal emailor anything like that, so I was aware of that    Correct.    I think the screenshot might actually annexed here somewhere.    Correct.    Chair, are we talking about the meeting at my house or [Intervenes].    Yes, because I cannot comment on the meeting with Watson and the office [Intervenes].    I do not know about that. [Intervenes].    I believe they were.    Correct.    I believe that there was a meeting where Gavin tried to convince him and got him to swear on the Bible that he had not signed the statement.    Not to sign the statement.   Not to turn whistle-blower.    Correct.    Correct.    That is right.  I am basing it only on what was told to me.    I recall the meeting vividly.    Well at that meeting we basically just discussed the way forward in terms of contacting -  At that stage we wanted to contact Billy Hofmeyr.  We wanted to contact the Hawks, SARS and that was basically what we discussed at that meeting, apart from you know, discussing as well the issues with regards to where the stumbling blocks would be and what avenues to use to go for the corruption matter and to clear that up and to clear up every bodies names.   Chair at that stage, it was only people that were with Bosasa and the majority of them were whistle-blowers.  I think there was maybe two or three people including myself that we not part of Bosasa.    Correct.    No, definitely not.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    Correct.    Yes.  That is correct?    Yes.    Correct.    That was told to me by Mr Venter.    It was a threat.  It was always used.    That is correct  Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.  That is how it looks.    I did not create the systems and procedures to corrupt people and bribe people.      I think you need to repeat your question Chair if you could please ...[intervenes]    I am tired Chair and the air-conditioning does not seem to be working in the venue.    It is hot enough in this heat.    I am exhausted.   As it please Mr Chair.    I appreciate that Chair.  We can start early tomorrow morning. If that pleases you.    I put in a request Chair to Advocate ...[intervenes]    To – if we could start a little bit later, because I do have an urgent appointment to attend to, but I do not want to disrupt the Commission.  I will postpone my appointment if I have to.
