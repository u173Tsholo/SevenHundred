CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Myburgh, good morning everybody.    Yes are we ready?    Yes thank you.  You may do so from where you are if you are able to do so. ADV    Good morning.    Thank you.    Okay.     Yes.    Should you not – should Counsel not for Mr Gama start or is that the arrangement made between the two of you?    He might – he might like two bites at the Chair so to speak.    Because he can reply.  I think they will sanitise the podium and then you can go to the podium.  Ja.    No I think if – for this I think he should – ja.    Ja.    Yes I see that you have prepared written submissions which – oh no I think I did see – I see the    Yes you may proceed.    Yes.    Yes.    Was the delay seven days?    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    No I do not think I have seen the supplementary affidavit.  On what page is it in the bundle?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes maybe you can con – you can tell me what it says.    And so on.    Ja.    Ja. ADV    Hang on one second I think it is more convenient if you take out the affidavit – the supplementary affidavit and annexures and if they need to be brought back they can be brought back rather than bring the whole file.    Yes., no, no what they – they can file – put them in the right place in the file that I have in due course.  Yes you can continue.    Well before you do that I see that the supplementary affidavit seems to be quite substantial.     I thought it is a brief affidavit.  I see it is twenty four pages.  I think I will need to read it properly that is twenty four pages without the annexures.    No I think I would need to read it and I do not think I can read it this morning for this application to proceed this morning.      Yes.  I thought it might be two, three or five pages or something like that but it is quite substantial and I see that it is longer than the – I think it is longer than the founding affidavit.    Yes.    Factor that read – that led to this delay of – of four days Mr Chair.    Yes.  Yes.    No, no you are right.  I think the difficulty is simply that it arrived you said over the weekend.    I have not had time – I am seeing it for the first time.  It may have been sent to me I do not know maybe I just did not see it but I would need to read it.  So…    I think in terms of – in terms of the arrangement your client is supposed to give evidence later in the week is it not?    Ja from today.    Yes, ja.    Ja, ja.    Ja.    Ja.  Ja.  I think we should adjourn the application to tomorrow morning so I can read this – this evening.  I do not know whether the legal team had any plans of corresponding or they will not be responding because that might affect whether we adjourn it to tomorrow.  But I can only get a chance to read it tonight.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes. ADV    It does not…     Does – does the supplementary affidavit only seek to supplement the original affidavit in respect of condonation?    Oh okay.  Well maybe – I am tempted to – to deal with it if that is what – if that is all it does but maybe I should err on the side of caution and rather read the affidavit. Probably then if it deals only with condonation probably the position may be that the legal team does not intend to file anything but Mr Myburgh will tell me just now.  So subject to that I think we are – I would adjourn the – the application to tomorrow at half past nine.    Ja okay alright.    Thank you.  Mr Myburgh and then they can just sanitise the podium before Mr Myburgh goes there.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Okay no that is fine.  Okay.  So shall we say that you will indicated by end of the day if your view changes on that?  I do not know if you will get a chance to – to look at anything but I just want to know whether we can say the application is adjourned to tomorrow half past nine. just want to know whether we can say the application is adjourned to tomorrow half past nine.    Yes okay.    Okay no that is fine.  So this application is adjourned to tomorrow at half past nine in the morning.  Okay.  Your – would the next matter be that of the cross-examination?    Yes.    Yes he – he ex – he is on – his understanding is that we will start at ten so because it is still ten to ten he must be on his way.  I think we will adjourn until ten o’clock.      Ja.  We adjourn.    Good morning Mr Pretorius.    Good morning everybody.  Are you ready?    Yes.    Yes let us do that.  Let us start with the legal representatives of Mr Gigaba.  If you are able to – okay they will need to sanitise the podium before you go in – you go there and the legal representatives of Witness No. 3 may have – may later place themselves on record from where they are if it is possible but if not then they will proceed to the podium at that stage.      Good morning.    Yes.    Yes, no, no you should not be long.    Okay no that is fine.  Mr Pretorius I think needs to come back to the podium.  Oh I am sorry Ja.  Counsel for Witness No. 3.    Good morning.    Thank you Mr Dube.    Okay.  I think it might serve a useful purpose Mr Pretorius for the benefit of the public if possible if you could just give the gist of Witness No. 3’s previous evidence so that the cross – the cross-examination may they follow it better.    Yes.      Just one second.  I need the – my file that relates to the in camera application.  No that is not the one.  But it is among the files that you were given this morning Registrar.  It is written on the spine In Camera Application.  Okay let me see maybe – maybe I thought it was not the – no I think I was wrong.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    No that – that is fine.  Before we do that I just want to say that it is most concerning that attempts by some in our society cont – seem to continue to intimidate and attack people who – who want to assist this nation on the matters that this commission is investigating. People want to assist this commission to understand what happened in regard to the matters that it is investigating. It is completely unacceptable that witnesses whether they have given evidence before the commission or are still going to give evidence before the commission are targeted and attacked and attempts are made on their lives.  Attempts are made to kill them.  It is completely unacceptable and I would ask the law enforcement agencies to please assist this commission by dealing with these matters expeditiously because those who seek to silence people who want to assist the commission; who want to assist the nation to understand what happened seemed to be quite determined to continue and attacks on one person whether he or she has previously given evidence or is still to give evidence may well deter many others that the commission wishes to hear from on the matters that it is investigating. I applaud the courage of various people in our country who despite threats to their own safety and to their lives and to the safety and lives of their loved ones have nevertheless come before this commission to assist the nation to understand what happened with regard to the matters that we are investigating. I applaud those who will still continue to come to the commission to give evidence or to assist the commission in any way despite these acts of intimidation and criminality by some in our society who silence people who want to assist this commission. I hope that the law enforcement agency will act with speed to deal with these matters and to protect all witnesses who are under threat wish to assist this commission or whoever assisted this commission. I thank Witness 3 that he has once again made himself available to assist the commission despite the reports that have been heard of the attempted killing of Witness 1.  We are grateful that Witness 1 survived the attack. Okay.    Yes.  We are going to start Ms September you there?    You confirm that you are with Witness 1 where you are?    I am sorry Witness 3 I am sorry – Witness 3?  Do you confirm that you are with Witness 3 where you are?  Correct Chair.    Okay alright.  I have previously seen Witness 3 he previously took an oath in front of me so if a member of the legal team confirms that she is with Witness 3 I accept that.  Witness 3 good morning to you.    Thank you very much Witness 3 for availing yourself to once again come and assist the commission.  We appreciate that very much.      The Registrar will administer the oath to you now when she says give your full names do not give your real names just say Witness 3, is that alright    Okay alright.  Registrar you may go ahead.    Thank you.  Then Witness 3 you will be cross-examined by Counsel for Mr Gigaba.  I normally put the – fix the duration of the cross-examination at the beginning of the cross-examination. Counsel for Mr Gigaba do you – I do not think you should need anything more than 45 minutes?    Okay let us – let us say 45 minutes but we will see at the end of 45 minutes how it goes if it is necessary to – to go into an hour – to an hour then we will – I will – I will allow you.    Okay alright.    Yes.    He should be but Mr Pretorius will know better.      He should have access to all documents that were known to the legal team as the documents that would be used in the cross-examination.    Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  So – so I think there will be a problem with the report because it looks like nobody was given notice that it could be – it would be used.    Well – well it may well be- well 1. They say the witness does not have the report it might be the best situation to just answer something in relation to a report where you might not know the context.    Maybe if – if – maybe if while you proceed Counsel for Witness 3 and Mr Pretorius have access to the report and you indicate to them in what area you want to ask questions about while you proceed they might be having a look at – at the relevant portion of the report and when you are done with other aspects of your cross-examination we can check with them whether they have any problem.    And then there is the question of – of course they might have an idea whether the witness could fairly be asked to answer questions even if she has not – he has not seen the report.    Maybe just repeat the reference so that in case somebody did not get it correctly down.    Yes okay.  I think Counsel for Witness 3 looks at me as if to say I do not have it and I think he sees Mr Myburgh giving Mr Pretorius a copy.  Maybe if he does not have maybe once Mr Pretorius has looked at it – at the relevant portion he might share with him and then we take it from there.    Yes.    Yes.  I think Mr Pretorius would like to say something.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. ADV PRETORIUS    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.      Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Until you have had discussions with Counsel for – Witness 3 and Mr Pretorius and then we will take the matter from there.    Yes.    Yes.  I think we must all be quite careful that there is apart from an intentional disclosure of information that should not be disclosed there could be situation where unintentionally information is disclosed which could lead to disclosure of identities so we all just need to check very carefully.    Ja.    Ja, no, no …    No, no, no.  Remember the arrangement is that you will have discussions with Mr Pretorius and Counsel for Witness 3.  When the three of you have discussed maybe you find a way then that can be told to me and then I can take it from there.  So for now we will exclude that part of your cross-examination.    Ja okay.    Witness 3 can you hear us?    Okay which affidavit would you like him to confirm to have?    Have you got that affidavit Witness 3?   Are you looking for it or did you not hear me?  Ms September are you there?    Okay alright.  You must just tell me if you are still looking so that I know that you have heard me.  Okay ja he says he has got it.    Yes I am trying to look at what I am having in front of me and I could not see – just repeat the bundle Mr Pretorius.    My Registrar says if it is an Eskom bundle we do not have it here.  Is it an Eskom Bundle?    That is fine.  If – while she is looking – okay Registrar let me have Mr Pretorius bundle while you look for – for the right one.  Check if we do not have it here.  Arrange for the protectors to go and get it.  Okay, I have got it.       Yes.     Yes, he said he has got it.     Just one second.  Did you find the file?   Oh, okay alright. I am sorry.   Mr Pretorius(sic), I wanted to return your file if she had found ours but she did not find it.  And they are trying to get it from the residence.       Yes, you may proceed.       She is just trying to find the bundle for me.     You want to just repeat the bundle number and everything unless she has found it.  Okay, she has found it.  Maybe the page number?     Thank you Mr Witness 3.  Is this the right file?     Okay.  There seems to be a problem with the reference.     What bundle is it, first, if it is a bundle?     Okay that will not be a bundle as such but I think I know which document it is.  Mr Pretorius, is it the in-camera application?     Yes.     Oh, okay.     No, no.  Thank you Mr Pretorius.  It was under another file.  I think I have got too many files here.     Yes?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay, okay.       Yes, okay.     So you just give the reference afresh so that...     Ja.     Sorry, I think your SEQ reference is not complete.  Is it SEQ-07/20201?     I think that is the correct reference.     And then you say page?     Is that the red number or at the bottom?     [No audible reply]      Yes, it is page 51 on the red numbers at the right top corner and page 115 at the bottom.     Have you got it Witness 3?     Okay alright.       Witness 3, can you hear us?   The question is whether you ...[intervenes]      The question is whether your evidence is that one some occasions these visits to the Gupta residence were recorded in the diary but on other occasions they were not recorded.  Is that your evidence?     He said that is correct.     I am afraid you will just have to ...[intervenes]      ...reference because we are using different...     Ja.     H’m?     Yes, okay alright.     Yes.     No, no.  That is fine but each time you refer just for the transcript.     It will be important to say ...[intervenes]      To record, ja.     Okay.  Ordinarily ...[intervenes]      Yes?     Yes, and the page numbers?     Okay that is the red numbers at the top right hand corner, 125.     Do you see that Witness 3?     I am sorry.  I ...[intervenes]      Well, okay if he has answered, I thought you might break it up into manageable propositions.     Just to make sure that...  Ja.     Well, maybe before you put that.  What counsel was putting to you Witness 3 was that in your affidavit, particularly in paragraphs 20.1 and 20.2, you have said none of the visits were recorded in the Minister ’s diary and you said by instruction of the Minister you did not record the trips to the Gupta residence in the logbook of your vehicle.  He just wanted you to confirm that you accept that that is what your affidavit says.  Do you agree with that?     Okay alright.  I think you can take it from there.       Okay alright.     Well, maybe you should still say against the records of either the diary or the logbook.     I think it will be much more clearer to him.  Ja.     Did you say you agree?     I think the proposition was.  You agree that because there is no written record of the visits, either in the Minister ’s diary or in the logbook.  Then as to what the true position is, the Commission needs to depend on your word as well as the word of the former minister, Minister Gigaba?     Okay.     What...what...what ...[intervenes]      One second.  I think they have got my file.  So let us return Mr Pretorius(sic) so that he can have access to it.  Thank you.     Just give me the page again?     Okay I have got it.  Thank you.     It might be clearer if ...[intervenes]    ...you specifically say what the confusion was that you see to address.     And if that clears it up.     Ja.     Witness 3, can you hear us?     I am sorry, I am sorry, I think let us break it up.  First, witness 3, counsel for Mr Gigaba says that Mr Gigaba’s version is that he never gave you such instructions.  What do you say to that?     Okay and counsel for Mr Gigaba will now tell you what Mr Gigaba has to say in substantiation of this denial that he gave such instructions.  Yes, you may proceed.     What do you say to that?     Before you do so, I see – I think we are at about 40 minutes, what is your assessment of how much more time you need?     No, that is fine.  Let us go up to quarter past eleven, then we take the tea break and when we come back – it is now about nine minutes past, when it is quarter then we will take the tea break.  When we come back you will need only about ten minutes.     Ja.  No, alright, okay, okay.     I am sorry, I think witness 3 might not have appreciated your question.  The question, witness 3, is whether you are in a position to deny Mr Gigaba’s statement that in 13 Dr Ben Ngubane was not Chairperson of Eskom but was an ambassador – was the ambassador of South Africa in Chile or China?     Chile.  Okay.  Do you have any comments about that?     Yes, what is your comment, what is your response?     Okay.  I take it that what you mean is that you might not be in a position to say what his position was in 2013 but what you are saying is that you saw him at the Gupta residence, is that correct?     Okay, does that help?     Okay.       This might not change anything, counsel, but because I have been hearing Eskom evidence I can indicate that Dr Ben Ngubane became Acting Chairperson of the Eskom board in I think March 2015 and at some stage, I think in 2015 still became Chairperson of the board but in 2016 he was Chairperson of the Eskom board.     Or maybe this might be the convenient time to take the tea adjournment.     We will take the tea adjournment now, it is quarter past eleven, we will resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.  You will try and keep within ten minutes?  Okay, alright.  Just switch on your mic.     Thank you, you may proceed.     Let me ask this question.  When you saw the convoy where were you, where about in the compound were you?     Was Mr Gigaba in the car and if so where?     Was he in the same car as you?     Was he in another car and you were in another car?     Okay.  Was he in a position to have seen what you saw namely former President Zuma’s convoy?     Okay, alright.     He says he does not remember taking the minister to the vault.     I have got page 126 and I have go the bundle, you say paragraphs?     Yes, I have got it.     Yes.     Did you say page 55?     Yes, yes, I have got it, ja.     Let me put this question.  Are you able to concede that what you were saying, namely that you could connect the dots to say the money came from the Saxonwold residence, and would it be correct to say that was simply a suspicion on your part?     Okay, I do not if that helps, Mr…     Ja.     Witness 3, did you hear the question?     The question is whether – the question is do you agree that in your affidavit you did not express that suspicion?     And the next question that counsel for Mr Gigaba asked was whether your statement was taken from you by one of the evidence leaders of the Commission, maybe Mr Pretorius?     He says the suspicion was there but maybe did not …[intervenes]     But maybe he did not voice it to the evidence leader.     Did you hear the question, witness 3?     The question is whether anybody assisted you to connect the dots before you gave evidence and said that you connected the dots and concluded that the money came from the Saxonwold residence?     I am looking at my watch.     Ja, I think you may be over by two minutes but you can wrap up.     Yes, I have heard evidence where a witness said he had been offered a lot of money in a bag and when he was asked to describe the bag he said it is like those bag that lawyers carry.     Okay, alright.  You might to repeat your question for the witness.     Is it different from a sports bag, witness 3?     Let me just say when you say /21, it is /2021.     Yes, yes.  And what page?     Yes, okay.     Yes.     Yes, I can see it.  Do you see it, witness 3, at page 56, line …[intervenes]     You do see it?     So what counsel is putting to you is that in your evidence you described the bag as a sports bag but you have today agreed with his – you have agreed when he asked you whether the bag you were talking – the travel bag is a bag that is different from a sports bag and it is a bag that people normally carry when they go to board aeroplanes.  That is what he is putting to you.  What do you have to say about that?     I must just say counsel I was hesitating when you used the example of aeroplanes whether the description was clear enough for the witness but I let it go.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Do you want to say anything to that, witness 3?     I am sorry, is that thanks, you will not comment or you would like to comment, witness 3?     Okay, alright.     Yes, yes.     Okay.  No, that is alright.  Of course there is still the other issue that you will discuss with Mr Pretorius.     And maybe – we will see how that one is resolved.     Okay, thank you very much.  Mr Pretorius, counsel for witness 3, do you want to ask some questions before he does or shall we allow him to re-examine?     Yes.     Okay, you will do that later.     Okay, alright.  They did not sanitise before you came in but they must then sanitise now.     Ja, okay, alright.       Yes, Mr Dube, how much time do you think you will take?  I want to see if I am going to limit you.      Okay, ten minutes should be fine, 15 minutes?     Ja.     Okay, alright.  Witness 3, your counsel, Mr Dube, will now ask you some questions as his re-examination.     Okay.  If you do not find it you will have to improvise as counsel.     Okay.     Just move the mic towards you so that you do not speak too far away from it.     Yes continue.     Continue, or are you done?     I am sorry, before you proceed Mr Dube, I take it that when you refer to those trips you are referring to the trips to the Gupta residence, in your question or did you mean all trips?   Okay, alright, is that how you understood the question, witness 3, as well?      Okay.      Well, you say you were knocking off, is that correct?      So, did the other protectors leave to go to their respective homes, while you remained behind?     Now, you have said that there were a number of occasions when you drove the Minister to certain places, including when he went to stadium.  Were you the only one, of the protectors, that the Minister would, from time to time, ask to drive him somewhere without the other protectors or did he do the same with regard to other protectors?        You are not aware that he requested other protectors, individually to take him somewhere without the other protectors?      Yes, okay, Mr Dube?      The times that you have specified when you saw certain people, doesn’t look like it is six times, you said the one time you saw Mr Brian Molefe, that’s one, the other time you saw Dr Ben Ngubane the second time, the other time you saw Mr Matshela Koko, that’s three the other time you saw Ms Linda Mabaso, that’s four.  Was it one of these four occasions that you saw the former President, Mr Zuma – Zuma’s convoy or was it a separate occasion?      So that would be five if my calculation is correct.      Oh, yes, so that might take us to six, okay, alright you may continue.      I’m sorry, asking whether he’s aware of the reports.      Thank you Mr Dube.      They will sanitise the podium before Mr Pretorius goes there.      Yes.      Well, that part, where I take further your questioning may be important, I say I don’t know if that’s like six to the witness, that is because you do not know how, that is the bag, came to the car, not because you do not want to tell us, you do not know how the bag that had money came into the car, is that right, witness 3 says, yes that is correct Chair.      Yes, that’s a question from me and I say yes and the witness repeats, “That is correct Chair, I do not know. Then I say, yes okay and then you say, and nor does your statement say where it came from, you expressed an opinion earlier but I just want to establish that, according to your statement and what you say now, you do not know the history of that bag and how that money came to be in the bag and the bag came to be in the boot of the Minister, we are correct and the witness says, that is correct Chair”.      Thank you, witness 3 I will excuse you now, depending on the outcome of the discussions between counsel for Mr Gigaba and Mr Pretorius and your counsel, it may be that you might be asked to come back some other time but for now, thank you very much for availing yourself for cross-examination, we appreciate it, you are now excused.      Yes, you are excused, I think we should take about – I’ll take about five minutes or ten minutes adjournment before the next witness, is that fine – is ten minutes fine?      Yes, okay we’ll take a ten minutes adjournment before the next witness, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes.    Yes, no that is fine.  Let them sanitise before you go there Mr Solomon.  Yes Mr Solomon.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine.  But now that you are there maybe I could check where the – whether you and I are on the same page on this that the time that I allowed you for cross-examination would have been more or less about an hour, is that your assessment as well?    Ja I think it started about twenty five to eleven.    Ja.  Then there was a fifteen minutes tea break.    And I think you stopped about ten to or five to twelve or thereabouts if I am not mistaken.    And 2 you did say there were some questions you would have liked to ask but I take it that  you did not think that they were necessarily crucial?    Yes.    Yes okay.    Okay no that is fine.  Okay thank you.  Okay your next witness is Mr Brian Molefe.    And this time he would be testifying in regard to matters relating to Transnet.    Welcome back Mr Molefe.    Thank you.  Your Counsel is here – your legal representative is that right?  Okay if you can place yourself on record from that side that would be fine.    Good afternoon.    Okay.    I am sorry you are not going to?    Okay I am not sure I think your voice is soft.  He is not going to read any statement – make any statement?    Well I know that last week he said he would like to make a statement I said well we will see when he comes back for Transnet but this time I was going to be careful to make sure that we check whether he implicates anybody before I allow him to just read his statement.  But if he is not going to make any that is fine.    Thank you.  Then I think the Registrar can administer the oath or affirmation again.    Do you affirm that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm.    Thank you; you may be seated.      Yes.    You might wish to – for the benefit of the public to just give …    An idea to the public what matters will be covered by Mr Molefe’s evidence.    Okay alright.    I guess we start with the bundle.  Do you have Transnet Bundle 5?  You look at the spine of the bundle to see whether it is Bundle 5 – 05.     You have got it?    And then I think you can go to the exhibit Mr Myburgh.    The affidavit of Mr Brian Molefe that starts at page 28 is together with its annexures admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit BB22.3.    Did we talk about how it would be dealt with – okay your – the bundle is part of Bundle 06 and then  you reflect your exhibit BB27 but when you say BB27 you are talking about all the documents that are in the bundle, is that correct?    Yes,  Yes.    Are Exhibit BB27.    But maybe that we will have Exhibit BB27.1 next – 27.1.    27.2 as we go along.    Okay.    Hm.    Oh you mean for example in the Fundundzi Report?    With – well the commission has not made any report.  What – take me to the bundle and the page that you have in mind?    Later okay alright.  Okay.    Okay.    But in case you have any concerns the commission has not made any findings I certainly have not made any findings.    Okay alright.    Was is it not April…    I think it was February.    Yes, ja.    Ja.  Group CEO of Transnet was February 11.    Oh okay, okay.    Just before that Mr Myburgh.  You – you just made a point – you just made the point that when you went to Eskom in April 2015 that was under secondment.  The secondment did not last your entire time when you were at Eskom is it not?    Yes.    Some months.    Yes.  So – so as long as you were under secondment at Eskom.    You remained an employee of Transnet.    Yes but…    Yes.  But then you were appointed permanently by Eskom.    In September.    2015.    And once you were appointed permanently so to speak you ceased to be an employee of Transnet and became an employee of Eskom, is that right?    Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    Does not make you?    Oh.    Hm.    My 401 is a media statement released at the Chairperson’s instance on Wednesday night December .    Are the – okay no I am terribly sorry.  I made the mistake of looking at the red numbers.    Instead of looking at the red numbers so you were...    To the black numbers.  I have got the – I have got it ja.    Did the message come from (inaudible0.    From the 00   Okay.    Okay.    Did you ask them where you do get this from?    And what Counsel is saying Mr Molefe is maybe you may be forgiven for not having not – for not having taken it seriously when they sent you a message and said do you know that you are – you are going to be appointed CEO of Transnet.  But once it happened.   Then it happened only about what two/three months – two months after …    After the article.    He is saying surely at that stage you must have thought so it means these people knew what they were talking about so I should have taken them seriously.  That is what he is saying, what do you say to that?    Did not connect the article.    And the appointment.    You did not connect the article and the appointment?    Were you unemployed at the time of the article?    Does that mean you were employed or does that mean you were not employed?    Yes.    Yes how long had it been since you had left PIC, do you remember?    About six months.    Would it be correct to say – okay maybe I should not put this.  During that six months were you unemployed until you were called on the SANDF?    You were not looking for a job.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Was SANDF employment?    It was not employment?    Ja.    So – but would it be correct to say you were not employed during the six months?    Ja.  Okay alright.    Well maybe you were self-employed?    Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    You mean in the Eskom?    When you got the bundles.    When the bundle was made available.     H’m.     January 2011?     Ja, it is just important to mention the years because we deal with different years.       Ja.  January 2011, you say Mr Brian Khumalo called you.     He was from ...[intervenes]      ...Leaders Unlimited?     H’m.     Okay I think maybe you should stop there because ...[intervenes]      ...Advocate Myburgh knows how he wants to...     Yes.     Yes, let us take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS FOR THE LUNCH BREAK INQUIRY RESUMES AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK     Okay let us continue. EXAMINATION BY ADV MYBURGH SC     I am sorry.  Well, Mr Molefe, when counsel puts to you the proposition that he puts to you, he is giving you an opportunity to dispute his proposition.  To say that it is incorrect or to say it is correct.  Or if you think it is based on a false or premise say that because later on, that proposition may be relied upon in the assessment of all the evidence.       So I am just making sure that when you decide not to say anything, you know what the implications are.  That is all I am ...[intervenes]      No, he is not saying that.  He is saying to you.  If they wanted to talk to you, that is the Gupta’s ...[intervenes]      ...there would have been no need for them to send Mr Essa or anybody.   Because they were having direct interactions with you.     That is what he is saying.  You agree with that?     Okay alright.     Ja, that is what he is saying.  Ja.  Mr Myburgh.     I think I misrepresented what you were saying.     Of Eskom.     Well, Mr Molefe at the time that Mr Bester gave evidence, even if in 2011 or 2015 you did not know of his links with the Gupta’s, certainly at the time that Mr Bester gave his evidence before the Commission, you knew of or had heard.   You were aware of all the allegations of corruption associated with the Gupta’s and you would have heard that he was said to have been an associate of the Gupta’s.  And you would have been aware that the allegations, and there has been evidence, that he had been mentioned in a number of instances associated with allegations of state capture and corruption.  Is it not?     Yes.     Okay.  No, before you proceed. You would have been aware.  Being aware of that, I would have expected that if, when Mr Bester gave evidence he said that Mr Essa had told you in 2014 that you would be the next boss of Eskom and indeed the following year you did become the next boss of Eskom.  I would have expected you to be quite concern.   How could Mr Essa who is associated with all kinds of – who is associated with all kinds of allegations of corruption and state capture, have said he and whoever else, they have decided that I would be the next boss of Eskom.   And you did then become the next boss of Eskom.  I would have expected you to be concerned.  To     Yes.  You think I should have expected that you would have no problem with that?     Ja.     Sorry, just repeat that sentence.     No, no, no.  He said he heard from Mr Essa ...[intervenes]      Yes.  He was told by Mr Salim Essa.     That was his evidence.     Mr Essa may have had personal knowledge of it.     Well, he told him and it did happen.     I will allow you but I just want you to understand ...[intervenes]      Yes, because I am interested in your explanation.     Yes, okay alright.     Maybe complete your firstly, so I make sure I have heard all of it.       H’m?     Well, you do not know if it has anything to do with people that you do not know.  All you know is that the Minister approved you.     But you do not know whether the Minister might have had some discussion with either Mr Essa or the Gupta’s.  That you – that at least you would say to me you do not know this.  All you know is, the Minister approved you.       Yes.  And this would not be one of them.     Well, I am going to make one or two – say one or two things and then Mr Myburgh will continue.  On my logic, if it is true that you had never met Mr Essa and you did not know him ...[intervenes]      ...I would expect that that should worry you more than it should have if you knew him.  The fact that, particularly, when it did happen, you know, I mean – or rather when you bear in mind that you are told that he said in 2014 that they had decided that you would be the next boss of Eskom and then you know as Mr Bester is giving evidence that indeed the following year it did happen.   I would – my logic says if it was somebody that you knew maybe you might not be concerned because you know the person.  But if it is somebody that you did not     ...you have made your point.       Well, you are getting a chance.  You are saying it is conspiracy theories.  You are getting a chance to influence my thinking.  You see?  I am saying to myself.  Mr Essa...   I am saying to myself.  A newspaper belonging to the Gupta’s said on the 7 t h of December 2010 that they had on good authority that you would be appointed as Group CEO of Transnet.  That was December 7 t h.  January 7, February 7, mid-February and 11 or 12 t h, thereabout, I am not sure, you get appointed as Group CEO of Eskom... of Transnet.  That worries me.  How did they know?  How did they get it so right?   You say it does not worry you.  It did not worry you at the time.  Then I know hear evidence that somebody who was – who has accepted, in terms of the evidence that has been led, to have been a Gupta associates, tells somebody in 2014 in a meeting that we are very powerful.   We have decided that Mr Brian Molefe is going to be the next boss of Eskom.  And it happens the following year.  I do not see how I should not be wanting to find out how was that possible, particularly, when you tell me you did not know Mr Essa.  So.   But the opportunity is for you to put your perspective, put your side of the story, so that all of this can be taken into account in the assessment of the evidence.       I would have been worried?     Investigate?  Who is this person?  Where does he get this from?  Mr Myburgh.      [laughs]     We might be different Mr Molefe.     You...  But I am giving you the benefit of how I would have dealt with the matter and you are free and you might influence me to change my mind about that.      Okay.  Mr Myburgh.     I am sorry Mr Molefe.  I want to make sure I heard it clearly.  Are you saying if somebody – if you – if somebody testified under oath ...[intervenes]      ...and the gist of – part of his evidence was that somebody was using your name to advance corruption or his corrupt activities.  That would not concern you?     But if it is so, does it – for you, does it matter that you know or you do not know the person?     Well, I must confess.  I am very concerned about that evidence Mr Molefe.  If I heard that somebody went to an attorney, for example, or advocate ...[intervenes]      ...or a court official ...[intervenes]      ...and said – and used my name ...[intervenes]      ...in order to achieve wrongdoing ...[intervenes]    ...I would be very concerned ...[intervenes]      ...because I would never want anybody to use my name to advance criminality.  And I would have expected that that would be your attitude too.     Well, I guess I understand correctly to say as long as you do not know the person who uses your name to achieve wrongdoing, corruption, criminality, you would not be concerned?     You would not even want to go to the police and say I do not have all the facts but I heard somebody is going around, for example the township, collecting money using my name for criminal activities, you would not even go to the police because you do not know them?     Yes.     Mr Myburgh, continue.     Betrays you.     A guilty conscience portrays you.     Ja, that is to – ja, I think it means – it must mean that when you hear something being said.     Or maybe when you are accused of something that you know is true.     Your guilty conscience tells you but you know that is true.     So you might pretend that it is not true but inside your conscience …[intervenes]     You know.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Well maybe, Mr Myburgh, please do not forget the question you wanted to put just now before we move too far.  I want to go back a little bit to what you said about what your conscience or anybody’s conscience might do when a certain accusation is made.  I want to say what do you say about this proposition, that when something – when an accusation is being made against you – and now I am not talking about you, Mr Brian Molefe, anybody.  If you know it to be true, you may well do nothing about it because you know it is true.  You accept that that is one of the reactions that can happen.  I am talking now in general, it is a general proposition.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Okay.     Well, what do you say to – what would you say to a proposition that the reason why you may not have been, is it surprised, when the New Age predicted that you were going to – maybe predict is not the right word, they said they had it on good authority that you would be the next CEO of Transnet and when you did become Group CEO of Transnet a few months after the article and a few months after the journalist had contacted you, what do you say to the proposition that the reason why you did not want to find out how come the New Age got this so correctly is because you knew how they knew because you also knew that you were going to be the next Group CEO, so there was nothing to investigate because you knew where they go the information from.  What would you say to that?     Thank you.  Mr Myburgh?     No, no, no, that is fine, Mr Molefe, and it may well be that asking the journalist might be option but I know that journalists normally do not want to reveal their sources but at least now that you are there, it is legitimate to ask you whether you know particularly because it is your evidence that you went to the Gupta residence several times.     You had a relationship with them so – and it was a Gupta-owned newspaper.  So you might have said no, I know how it came about, I was approached, blah, blah, blah, or I know nothing about it, nobody talked to me.     No, no, no, I understand that.     No, no, you are not being ridiculed, your evidence is being tested.  That is part of investigating.     And what is being done is to put to you other possibilities to give you a chance to say no, but that is wrong because of a, b, c, d.     Well, I am not talking about the source.  Part of what one is trying to do, what the Commission is trying to do is what happened, who were the participants, who knew what and within the context of the questions – Mr Myburgh just explained to you there is the question whether you knew about these things or whether you did not know, you see, and you will give your evidence, say this I knew, this I did not know or I did not know anything but it is fair that you should be given a chance to say I did not know that, I knew that and this is the position.     Ja, no, no, that is fine.     Ja.     Ja, no, no, that is fine, that is fine.     But you must also understand that the evidence leader and I do not necessarily have to just accept what a witness says.  Some things you hear and you do not have further questions, maybe some time later you say no, but I should have asked that question.  Sometime as you hear what the witness says, a question arises and you put that to the…     Feel free to say what you know, when you do not know you say you do not know, it just does not mean – it just does not mean that Mr Myburgh, if you say you do not know, will necessarily just accept that like that.     Sometimes he might have no issues with you saying you do not know, sometimes he might have issues, same thing with me.       Ja, okay.  Mr Myburgh?     A month, are you saying seven, eight a months?     Oh, okay.     Well, just to recap from your evidence under the Eskom work stream, is my understanding correct that you said that your relationship with the Guptas preceded 2011 by a number of years?     Or you interactions with them.     Knowing them?     Yes, ja.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay, you mentioned two years, are you saying there had been the relationship with them might have started about two years before 2011 but knowing them might have happened a number of years earlier? MR     PIC.     Okay.     Ja.     Just raise your voice.     Yes?     I know that you do say you went to the Gupta residence several times.  I saw that particular …[intervenes]     Is it attached to your affidavit?     Okay, Mr Myburgh, do you want to assist him to …[intervenes]     Oh, okay.      Physically, I am sorry, what you are saying is as far as you are concerned, the frequency of your visits to the Gupta’s residents when you were at Transnet was no different from the frequency of your visits to the Gupta residents when you were at Eskom.      Okay.      Hang on, hang on Mr Molefe.      Hang on Mr Molefe let Mr Myburgh finish and then you can answer.      Yes, but I am simply saying, when you get a chance to respond, then you can take the point.      I am saying if you want to say anything in response to what he is saying, you can say what you want to say and then we will take it from there.      Sorry, yes.      Yes, but I think Mr Myburgh accepts that he might not have kept a tab but wants him to see whether he cannot give us a sense in the same way, as he did with regard to the visits because with regard to the visits, he also did not keep a tab but nevertheless, he was able to give a sense, I think that is what Mr Myburgh is trying to get.      Oh maybe, I was also trying to think which witness was that.      Ja, I put that to you, even though I did not quote, but the gist of it when you were giving evidence.      Not in a corridor, in a meeting at the Gupta residence.      Well, there are two versions.      Ja, but let me tell you what the version is about, on his version, he had a meeting at the Gupta residence on the 23 r d of October 2015 in the afternoon, a lunch and at that meeting, where him, Mr Duduzane Zuma, Mr Hlongwane and a Gupta brother.  It is true that he was not sure which of the Gupta brothers but what has been established through the evidence of Mr Duduzane Zuma and maybe Mr Hlongwane is that the Gupta brother who was at the Gupta residence on that day is Mr Tony Gupta.  That is where he says the discussion was but Mr Duduzane Zuma and Mr Hlongwane denied that a Gupta brother attended that meeting, and that there was the kind of discussion that Mr Jonas says took place in that meeting with a Gupta brother. And they simply say, Mr Tony Gupta popped in at some stage, while they that is Mr Duduzane Zuma and Mr Hlongwane were having a meeting with Mr Jonas, popped in to communicate something to Mr Duduzane Zuma and then left, those are the two versions.      Yes, according to Mr Jonas.      They denied that such a discussion took place between Mr Jonas and any Gupta brother.      Both of them denied.      But you see, Mr Molefe I think you seem not to understand something very fundamental about the Commission.       The Commission is continuing to investigate.  The Commission has not made any findings. The Commission has not accepted anybody's version.       That is why even when I put that version to you, when you were giving evidence under the Eskom work stream, I said something to the effect that this is what Mr Jonas said and if what he said is true, then, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, we have not accepted that Mr Jonas version is true.  We have not accepted that Mr Duduzane Zuma’s version and Mr Hlongwane versions is true. We are still probing as to what may be true and what may not be true, and the findings will be made later.       But you see – no, no nobody is ridiculing you Mr Molefe, if that is the word you used just now.      But that is because we had - just because you say it does not mean we immediately accept that okay, Mr Brian Molefe has said now he rejects…[intervene]      But when that is put to you, certainly when I put it and I think when Mr Myburgh puts it, it is on the basis to say, if we were to accept, if it was to be accepted that what he said was true, but whether it will ultimately be accepted as true, is something that will be seen when all the evidence has been added.  The idea is to test the soundness of various aspects of evidence.      Well, you see, Mr Molefe.      If for example, some of the propositions that Mr Myburgh puts to you because they are based on saying, well, maybe this is how the evidence should be looked at, if you were not to put that to you but later on, he presents arguments to me to say you must reject Mr Molefe’s evidence that he knew nothing about this, because of A, B, C, D.  And he never gave you a chance to deal with those propositions, you may have a case to say but he was unfair to me why did he not put this to me, so that I could show how flawed the proposition was that kind of - so the idea is just to make sure that one, there is fairness to for you, but if you say, look, I cannot - I do not know, I do not know that or I cannot answer that, it is fine.       Ja.      Ja, okay.      You know, whether you went there after the Public Protectors report?      Yes, okay.  But maybe I can take this opportunity to ask a question relating to the Public Protectors report.  My recollection is that when you reacted to the Public Protectors report, you did not want to say whether or not you had been to the Gupta residence and that you said there were, there was a shift in there, although I think you were, maybe smiling or laughing.  So maybe that was not serious. Am I correct to say, at that stage you did not say, well, it is true I have been there and I have been there many times?      Yes.      Tampered with?      Ja.      What is the point about that story?      Yes, but what is the relevance of that story to what you are dealing with?      Yes, but I do not want you to take too long in case after 30 minutes I find that it is not relevant.      Yes, but I do not want you to take too long if you can indicate to me this is the relevance, that will help.      But you knew yourself at the time in 16, that even though she might have been talking about your telephone records, or cell phone records, reflecting that you were on a number of occasions in the vicinity of – or in Saxonwold.      You knew that she was really trying to look at to what extent there may have been a relationship between yourself and the Gupta’s and you knew that you had frequented the residence many, several times as you put it, is that right?      Yes, but you are not suggesting to me Mr Molefe, are you that in 2016, when you were reacting to the Public Protectors report, you did not know, that you had been to the Gupta residence several times.  Do you accept that you have been?      Ja, okay.      Yes, okay alright.    My Myburgh.    Mr Myburgh before you continue are we all of the same understanding that if necessary we will go into the evening with Mr Molefe’s evidence?  Let me start with you Mr Molefe from your side you have no problem with that?    Yes okay.  Counsel for Mr Molefe that is fine with you as well?  We should not have any problem Chair.    Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh no problem.    You – you – do you think we conspired to make sure we put you into a corner where you cannot just jump out.    Okay alright let us continue.    Yes.    He says on the assumption as I understood him.  He said let us assume that they were involved in money laundering among other things and let us assume that Mr Molefe is innocent and was not involved on that so that – as I understood it that is how he started his question – his proposition.  Did you hear differently?    Okay let us…    Okay maybe let us just check with Mr Myburgh.  Mr Myburgh.    Yes.    Okay, okay.    Oh I am sorry I thought it was still your Counsel talking.    So it is you.  No, no your 00   But I am sorry Mr Molefe let us go back to what Mr Myburgh's question was because there is a question of whether he made assumptions or not.  So – then you can answer let us just get that right.  Mr Myburgh.    Ja, ja.    If any.    Ja well I – I must make sure I understand that correctly Mr Molefe because I do not want to attribute to you something that you did not say or mean.  You seem to be saying if you are friends – if you are friends with somebody and you are in charge of an entity such as Transnet and that friend of yours goes behind your back and effectively steals money from Transnet the entity of which you are in charge you will not feel that that friend of yours has betrayed you?    No, no let us talk the general proposition.    Are you saying that you would not feel that your friend has betrayed you?    Well – well I have been saying to you that no findings have been made.    I have been saying that quite a few times.    But we are probing to see what aspects of whose evidence are sound or are probably true and sometimes at this stage I might think part of what you say is true but later on when I sit down and have heard other witnesses I might change my mind.      So findings have not been made but we are probing – we have to test them ja.    Let us – let us.    I think I understand what you say Mr Molefe.    Well of course you…    But you know of course that they fled the country and you probably also know that they said in affidavits that were read out in an open hearing of the commission that they would never come back to this country and they did not want to subject themselves to legal processes in this country because they think that among others the Hawks and the NPA are unfair to them so that is – you know that that is the attitude they conveyed to this commission in 2018 or 2019 when they applied for leave to cross-examine.    Ja.    You may wait forever because they might never come back.  They fled the country.  They – the legal system Mr Molefe.    And…    Yes.  No I just want to say this Mr Molefe it is quite interesting that you referred to the position that initially their assets were attached or – and then – but then later on they – their assets were returned to them.  The legal system which made sure that if initially their assets were taken from them wrongly were returned to them.  The very system that – legal system that made sure they were returned to them that is the system they did not – they do not trust – that is the system that they do not come back to.    Ja.    Hm.  My Myburgh.    Try and go closer to the microphone.    I think some of your words are being swallowed.  You are swallowing.    Oh he is Dr Molefe.    Let us – Mr Myburgh let him finish.    Finish your answer Mr Molefe.    Maybe now that you are going to another subject we should take a short adjournment.  It is four o’clock let us take ten minutes break and then we will come back.  We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.     Is – how is the heat on that side of the house?     It is fine.  Okay.  So I think it is this side.  [laughs]  But it is fine.  We do not have to switch on the aircon as long as it is fine that side.  Okay let us continue.     It must have been exciting to be in an organisation – in charge of an organisation, not only that had a plan but also that had funding because it cannot be exciting if there is a plan but there is no funding to executive the plan.      ...performance.     Okay.      That had not been...?     Oh.     Okay.     That there was assurance...?     Ja?     Yes?     H’m?     So you...  Are you saying that after – from the time a need was identified for ...[intervenes]      ...goods or services ...[intervenes]      ...to the time of payment ...[intervenes]      ...there were various stages in the journey?     And at each stage ...[intervenes]      ...some assurance that you would be given ...[intervenes]      ...that what had happened before that stage ...[intervenes]      ...was in order?     And that is the point you are making?     Gates?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     H’m?     H’m?     Okay.     Shall I find that somewhere in his statement or in any document or not really?     Oh.     No, that is fine.     Okay.     Start with the bundle Mr Myburgh ...[intervenes]      485.1?     Oh, okay ...[intervenes]      405?     Oh, yes.     H’m?     H’m?     Yes.     Yes.  Thank you.     It refers to a potential conflict without, it seems, specifying the potential conflict.     Yes?     No, that is fair enough.  Well, he might need time to have a look at this Mr Myburgh.     Ja, that is fine.     No, that is ...[intervenes]      I think it is fine.  Go over it overnight.     And then you can deal with it when you have had a chance to look at this.     Yes.     Well, your junior, Mr Myburgh, could assist him to find the file.     I think, please help him...     Have you got – found it?  Oh, you want...  Have you got the page Mr Myburgh?     Please speak up.  Do not lower your voice.     The replacement?     When you say something like this, you mean the replacement?     Oh ...[intervenes]      Ja.     There is usually...?     Yes.     Okay, let him finish, Mr Myburgh.     Is that bundle – same bundle?     Is that we have a 3.3 notice?     Okay.     Yes,  No, I remember you raising that.     Yes.     Yes, maybe I need to explain that to Mr Molefe because it could be confusing to somebody not maybe used to Commissions.  I am the only person who would make findings that you should be concerned about.     But when investigators investigate, investigators of the Commission, they may form some views as to what the position is.     And maybe they could even – or some witnesses could put that as their conclusions or their findings but it is not my findings.  The ones that you should be concerned about are those that are made by me.     The ones that they may make or conclusions that they make are just opinions and so on and they can …[intervenes]     No, no, no, I accept that you were …[intervenes]     Yes, no, no, no.     No, no, no, I understand.     Yes.     Yes.  No, I understand.     Yes, no, no, I understand, ja.     I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, I thought you were at 323, are you now at 325?     Oh, okay.     Okay, sorry, I do not know what is wrong with me today from …[intervenes]     I think it is the second time I am focusing on red page numbers.     Of course.  Ja, no, no, no, that is fine.  Ja, 325.     Just hang on one second.  I think that     Ja, ja, ja.  Okay, alright.     That name there, Mr Myburgh, is Nyonya.     No, just for that …[intervenes]     Yes.     If I am pronouncing it wrongly somebody should let us know but that is my understanding of how it is pronounced.     Okay.     You are asking whether he knew then, Mr Myburgh?     Okay.     Yes, what Mr Myburgh is doing, Mr Molefe, is he is saying as far as he is concerned when he looks at this report.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     Ja.     Do I understand you …[intervenes]     Ja.     Ja.     Am I correct in understanding you to be saying you have no quarrel with the suggestion that if what the report says is what happened then it seems that there was large scale money laundering?     It seems so.  That is good enough, ja.     No, no, no, that is finding.     You see, the idea is this, that when Mr Myburgh reads this report, that is what seems to him.     But you might read this report and say but I do not agree that if this is what happened, it means there was [indistinct] 27.14 value, do not read – or you might even say no, it does not reflect any money laundering …[intervenes]     So the idea is just to give your own perspective.     Yes, ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.      Please raise your voice, speak up Mr Molefe.      I cannot hear you.      I cannot hear you.      I do not know what you are talking about.      And maybe, let us continue.       If at a later stage, you want to - you think there is something important about this incident, this example, you can come back to it, but let us continue for now.      Is it somehow like the man who walks next to the goats?      To close to the goats but he is not stealing them.       Ja, it is a file that should be in front of you one of the files in front of you, it should say Transnet bundle 5, 306, Transnet 06.  It is a smaller file I think, Transnet bundle 06.  What about the green one, that green one that you have in front of you?       Oh it looks like – oh I thought they were finding it somewhere else, Transnet bundle 06.      Okay, Mr Molefe they will give you another file.       You want to give Mr Molefe sanitizer, have you got sanitizer there?      Did they give it to you, will you be fine? Okay, alright.      Let us, maybe let us…[intervene]      Let us come – let just look at it from this angle, do you accept as you sit there today or do you not accept that it would have been irregular for Regiments to be brought in, in that fashion without being subjected to that process of verification, you accept that?      Yes, okay alright.      Yes.       Yes, okay but as you sit there looking at this, and accepting that it would have been irregular for Regiments to be included without going through this verification process.       Are you leaving out what might be found if there is a memo and Mr Myburgh has already said that I think it is unlikely there would be any memo, leaving that aside, can you think of any reason why it would have been justified to include Regiments without subjecting Regiments to that process that Letsema had been subjected to?      Yes.      Your voice is lowered.      To get?      Yes.      Ja.      Ja, no that is fine, Mr Myburgh. ADV MYBURGH      And Mr Singh is coming, of course.      Regiments.      Yeah, you.       Yes.      Yes.      Would it be correct to say you are keen to find this out because on your own understanding it would have been irregular for Regimens to be included without going through the process, so you are keen to find out what justification may have been put up?      Yes.      Alright, Mr Myburgh.       Must I take volume 6, bundle 6 away or you still needed?      Okay, I have limited space here so I have to keep an eye on how many files I keep here.      Mr Molefe?      You have found it.      Oh, okay.      Ja, okay.      I am sorry, Mr Myburgh maybe now that you have discovered that you have got it there, maybe the one that was lent to you should go, so that you do not end up.      Ja, it should be returned to whence it came from.      Do I have that?      I do not, okay.     Without having won any tender.     And without having won any tender.     H’m.     So it is like – I am sorry Mr Myburgh – so it is like Mr Molefe Regiments comes in and says no I just want – I will just take a hand, then after some time it says I want the whole arm, and then later on it says no I am taking over everything, when then McKinsey ...[intervenes]      H’m?     I don’t know if there is a difference, but ultimately they would take the position of the main contractor.     When in fact they were not even there at the beginning.     Slowly they come in, then they want more, and then ultimately maybe somebody might say they push McKinsey out and take over, but maybe it is not pushing out, but they take over in the end.     Mr Myburgh?     The ETC.     I have forgotten the abbreviation what it stands for.     He is asking whether you can see on page 405.15 that Mr Anoj Singh signed this memorandum on the same day, namely 16.04.14, same day as the letter that McKinsey sent to Regiments.     Add to the above approvals.        Hang on Mr Molefe, hang on, hang, hang on, so we don’t waste time.  As I understand it the arrangement that has been reached between Mr Myburgh and yourself and your counsel is that in regard to the documents that you received last night Mr Myburgh would ask questions, but you have a right to say I am not able to answer questions on this document because I need more time and that will be respected, so that is the arrangement, and all you need to say is look I need to have more time on this document and then that will be – nobody has forced you to answer questions on documents where you need time that you received last night.     Yes, but you are free to say look I need to have time to do this and that will be accepted.     Ja okay.     But we are going to waste time now.  Mr Molefe you said you need more time, that is accepted.     Ja.     You might wish to make a note Mr ... – you might wish to make a note of the documents he would like you to look at overnight.     Oh it is tomorrow.     Okay, that’s fine.     Well the studying of the documents will happen overnight but you say before you – you will get a chance to ...[intervenes]      Well isn’t the position that – just one sec – isn’t the position that it is better that you look at all the documents that you got last night in respect of which you haven’t had time to reflect, just so that we don’t have a situation where later on you might say well I looked at only the documents that were mentioned but I didn’t look at the others that I also got.     Received last night? MR MOLEFE;   Ja.  You see the thing about the documents that were received last night some of them we had, some of them we had, so skimming through them it is difficult to say because now you see this one we have, this one eish I am not sure, and so on, and it is not possible to ...[intervenes]      Ja, there was not enough time compare and check.     Ja, no, no that is fair enough.     Okay, alright.     No that is fine.     Yes.  But I think subject to what the position will be when we adjourn the idea would be that Mr Molefe comes back tomorrow and if there is going to be a request for the adjournment of the hearing of his evidence or the adjournment of the hearing of his evidence in regard to certain issues then we can deal with it at that stage.  Okay, alright, it is one minute past six, I think every two hours we should just have a short adjournment.   Let us have an adjournment, unless – your estimate is that we are still going to take some time?   I don’t know how the documents that you can’t ask Mr Molefe about affect the time that you needed for today.     I think you are right, so maybe we should adjourn now.     Maybe we should adjourn now so Mr Molefe gets enough time to look at the documents and talk to his legal team, and then also because you say it is important for you if possible to deal with the documents before you move on because of the chronology that you want to deal with. So let us adjourn now, and then resume at ten tomorrow.  I have that other application at half past nine, I don’t know if you have had an opportunity ...[intervenes]      Okay no that is fine.  Okay we are going to adjourn now.  In regard to Mr Molefe’s evidence will resume at ten tomorrow, in regard to the other application of Mr Gama, that will be at half past nine tomorrow morning. We adjourn. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson.    Yes thank you.  Chairperson we are going to start the proceedings today by dealing with an application brought by Mr Gama to cross-examine Mr Todd that is sequence SEQ10 of 2021 you do have the file in front of you. Mr Gama is represented by Counsel I do not know if you wish for him to place himself on record before I start with my very brief submission?    Thank you Chairperson.  I am going to address you for not more than five or six minutes I know that time of the essence.    But let me get to the point.  Mr Todd Mr Chairperson you will remember gave evidence on…    I am happy for him to start yes.    As you please Mr Chairperson.    Mr Oldwadge enquires as to whether he could make his submissions from where he is?    Yes.    Mr Chairperson in relation to the supplementary affidavit.    Which I must confess I have not had an opportunity to study.    But it is certainly unlikely given what we indicated to the – our opponent.    That we would wish to say anything in response.    And we do not intend from our side of course it is up to you.    But you say is confirmation.    Yes that would – that would be in order Chairperson.  I will give you an undertaking I will look at the affidavit over lunch.    And I will – I will come back to you straight after that.    Yes the next order of business Chairperson is scheduled to be Mr Gigaba’s cross-examination of one of the in camera witnesses.    I do not know where Mr Pretorius is because I know he is dealing with that.    Thank you Chairperson.    Mr Chairperson before we start Mr Solomon has indicated that he wishes to place something on record with your leave if …    If there is an opportune time for him.    Yes.    That is correct.    Thank you Chairperson.    Chairperson the…    Certainly.    Yes.  The matters that will be covered by Mr Molefe’s evidence broadly Mr Chairperson are those set out in the summons and by and large we will be dealing with the issue of the McKinsey and Regiments contracts.   We will be dealing with issues relating to the acquisition of locomotives – 95 locomotives; 0 locomotives, 64 locomotives. That really lies fundamentally at the heart of our questioning of Mr Molefe. There of course are a number of introductory things that we need to deal with but much of the evidence will revolve around McKinsey, Regiments and the locomotives.    Mr Chairperson the two exhibits that are of particular relevance are Exhibit 22 which you will find in Bundle 5 that is being produced for this hearing and then Exhibit 27.  Exhibit 22 is Mr Molefe’s Transnet exhibit.  Exhibit 27 is a so called POI Bundle which has documents in it that are common to the witnesses that we intend to lead and deal with this week being Mr Molefe, Mr Gama and Mr Gigaba and Mr Singh. Mr Molefe you have in front of you Exhibit 22?    Could I ask you please…    Yes thank you.  If I could take you then please to page 28 and there you will find an affidavit.  You have been here I know many times so when we refer to page numbers we are referring to the black numbers on the left hand side.  I just would ask you to confirm Mr Molefe that this is an affidavit that you deposed to it runs from  page 28 to 51 and it was deposed to it appears on the 20t h January 21 containing a series of annexures running up until page 114.  Would you confirm that that is your affidavit and that you have deposed to it as reflected here?    And would you confirm the truth and accuracy of that affidavit?    Chairperson might I ask you then to enter into evidence Mr Molefe’s affidavit dated the 20t h of January 2021 as Exhibit BB22.3?    And then Mr Chairperson as I have mentioned the other relevant exhibit is Exhibit BB27 found in Bundle 6.  That contains a series of investigation reports I do not know if – if Chair you want to admit the bundle now or it is admitted as we – we deal with the reports when dealing with Mr Molefe’s evidence?    Yes I think it might be more appropriate then Chair that I deal with it and I ask you to introduce the bundle when we come to the particular documents.    If you would prefer that?    That are…    Thank you Chair.    Yes.    Alright thank you.    Thank you Chairperson.    Mr …    Mr Molefe I am not going to take you through your – your statement in the order in which it is – it appears.  I am going to ask you some general questions and then more specific questions where you do in your affidavit deal with topics that I am going to touch on – I will take you there insofar as is necessary. You will understand and appreciate I am sure that Transnet is a different stream to the Eskom stream and there are some things that I need to revisit.  I know you have given evidence about them before but I am going to try in dealing for example with your personal details and predictions as to your appointments which are relevant for our purposes but I will try and summarise and roll those up so as not to waste time. In relation to your personal details we know that you worked in the Premier’s office in Limpopo then you had a stint in National Treasury; you held a number of very senior positions.  You then of course were the CEO of the PIC from June 2003 to July 2010 and then in April of 2011 you became the GCE of Transnet.  Would you confirm that?    April – I beg your…    February I beg your pardon.    February of 2011.    Yes and I – I have – where I misread my notes is that you held that position until April 2015.    So it started in February.    Of 2011 until April 2015 I am indebted to you Chairperson. So that was for a period of approximately four years Mr Molefe.    Alright.    Yes.    And I was going to come to that so you were seconded to Eskom that – that is in the April 2015.    As you mentioned, alright.  And you remained at Eskom as I understand it until December of 16, is that correct?    Right.  And then we also know that you had a short stint as a member of Parliament and I am not going to – to deal with that.      Now so far as your – your educational qualifications are listed.    Chair.  Now so far as your academic qualifications are concerned I understand that you – you have an array of degrees and I supposed we need no go through all of them but from what I understand you have a B.Com from Unisa, a Masters in Business Leadership from Unisa and you have amongst other things an Honorary Doctorate in Engineering from the Glasgow Caledonian University, is that correct?    Yes.  You have other Honorary Doctorates?    So I suppose Mr Molefe given your qualifications and experience you were really ideally placed to detect any form of corruption whilst you were the GCE of Transnet.    Well…    So you say you did not have then the necessary skills.    Or experience within which to detect corruption.    Alright.    Yes.    Yes.    I accept that you were not a specialist corruption detection machine did you detect any corruption while you were the GCE of Transnet?    Oh sorry.    Now you have been asked about the New Age prediction.    The New Age prediction of your appointment as GCE of Transnet.  As I understand it though you have not previously been actually shown the newspaper article.  Could I ask you to go to Exhibit 22 which you have in front of you and could you please turn to page 401?  Mr Molefe it is Exhibit 22.   So it is your exhibit at page 401.  Alright you see…    I think that you may be in the wrong exhibit or divider Chairperson.    Ja.    401 I beg your pardon – the black numbers.    Alright.  So Mr Molefe you will see that  that was a newspaper report it was published on the 7t h of December 2010, do you see that?    Now I take it you would not dispute that the first publication of the New Age actually happened the day before.    The first publication of the New Age was on the 6t h of December 2010 this was the second day of the existence of this newspaper.    Right.  And we do know that the New Age was Gupta owned, correct?    Alright.  And …    And what – what this says is that former Public Investment Corporation PIC Chief Executive Officer Brian Molefe is said to take over as Transnet boss and then 1,2,3, 4 paragraphs below that the New Age has it on good authority that Molefe will be appointed CEO of the board, you see that?    Now as I understand it you say that you – you knew nothing about this?    But it was brought to your attention at the time.    Yes I think perhaps I can just cut through my questioning by asking you to look at the bottom of the article.  Contacted for comment Molefe says I have not been informed I do not know anything about it.  Were you contacted at the time?    Yes.    Now Mr Molefe would you – I mean you have said that you do not know anything about this; you cannot explain it.  I mean do you think it was a lucky guess on the part of the New Age while speculation – how do you think it came about?  You no doubt would have reflected carefully on it when you get a phone like you did and you were asked to comment about your testimony.    You did not?    Alright.    But what I am really getting at is once you were appointed as the Transnet GCE did you surely must have reflected back and thought well hell someone knew something that I did not know.   You must have but how is that possible I mean it seems so natural and obvious.    Alright.      Thank you Chairperson.  Just sticking with the New Age of course under your watch as GCE Transnet then went on to sponsor the New Age big interview, correct?    One of the topics that we will come to.  So that is on the 7t h of December now I do not know if you this but you were actually nominated for the position of GCE by Mr Iqbal Sharma you know that?    Can you turn to page 400 please just a page before that article – page before.  That email 13 t h of January sent to Leaders Limited they were the head hunters.  You will remember that you made reference to them when    I beg your pardon in the Eskom steam.      Yes ...[intervenes]      Mr Chairperson, I see that it is just past one o’clock.     I take it that you would like to take the lunch adjournment.     And you would have noticed Mr Sharma as a member of the selection panel?     Now are you aware of the fact that Mr Sharma had some business interest together with Mr Essa?     But you have read about that, have you not, in the documents that you have been provided with?     Yes.  There is reference there in one of the money flow reports and we will come to that in time.  Reference is made to the fact that Mr Sharma and Mr Essa worked together, at least in 2021, at a company called ISA Capital.  You have read that?     Alright.  Now just to continue the chronology before I move to another topic.  That is in January of 2011.  What we know is that in May of 2011, not long after that, you might have read about Mr Gigaba, the then Minister Gigaba, seeking to replace Mr Mkwanazi, the chairperson with Mr Sharma as the chairperson.  Have you read about that?     And we will deal with that Mr Gigaba.  And Cabinet refused that attempt to make Mr Sharma the chairperson.     Yes.     Alright.  But what you would be aware of is that a year or so later in August of 2012, Mr Sharma was appointed, was he not, as the chairperson of the BABC?     Let us then deal with your appointment as the CEO of Eskom also having been predicted.  Now I am aware that you have been asked questions about this but of course Mr Bester was a Transnet stream witness.     And you remember his evidence was that he went to a meeting with Mr Essa at JB’s Corner in Melrose Arch sometime between, I think, it was May and November of 2014.     And it was at that meeting that     But you did not need to meet Mr Essa.       Yes.  Mr Essa was a Gupta lieutenant as he is being described in regard to make contact with people like Mr Bester.  He did not – so the Gupta’s did not need to make contact with you through Mr Essa, Mr Molefe.  Correct?     The Gupta’s did not need to make contact with you through Mr Essa ...[intervenes]      ...to...  you were a longstanding associate of theirs.  Correct?     Yes.     If you could perhaps just deal with my proposition.  The Gupta’s did not need to send ...[intervenes]      Well, let us explore the role of Mr Essa.  Two examples come to mind.  And you will see as I go through your evidence, it is really punctuated with Mr Essa.  Let me give you two examples of where Mr Essa pops up.  One here in this meeting with Mr Bester, right.  And where he also pops up is Mr Gama gives evidence that he sees Mr Essa in Mr Singh’s office.  He says in the latter part of 2015.     Yes, at Transnet.  And he goes in     Yes.  Sorry.  Can you just deal with my proposition?  It is not surprising that Mr Essa was not deployed to meet with you because you were dealing with the Gupta’s directly. MR     I see.     Ja.       Thank you.  So ...[intervenes]      No, not at all and I think you correctly summarised it. Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Molefe, so is this just another coincidence then?  I mean, there is a prediction that you are going to become the GC of Transnet.  That turns out correct.  Here you told or there is a piece of evidence that Mr Essa tells Mr Bester that you are going to become the next CEO of Eskom and that happens.  Do you just talk that down to a coincidence?     A coincidence?     So when you first ...[intervenes]      When you say ...[intervenes]      When you say you cannot comment, do you mean that you really cannot or you do not want to?     Well, I want to engage you about this.  So presumable when you...  When did you first here this quite riveting evidence, shocking evidence by Mr Bester?  When did you first hear of it?       Yes.  It was clear before the Commission and he gave this evidence that Mr Essa told him between May and November 2014 that you would become the new CEO of Transnet.  Where did you first hear of that evidence?     I beg your pardon.  Of Eskom.     Yes.     Well ...[intervenes]      But it must have surprised you?     No?     Oh.     I see.     You did not ...[intervenes]      I see.     But this is ...[intervenes]      But Mr Molefe, we are going to spend a long time together, it seems.     But and it is not ...[intervenes]      It is not a bad thing.     No, no.  No, you do not.     You can assist me but ...[intervenes]      Perhaps if you could just bear with me and allow me to answer – or ask my question.  Are you seriously saying that when you heard that Mr Essa had said this that that did not surprise you or concern you at all?  That is really my question.  Yes or no?     Right.  Well, you do know of Mr Essa’s links with the Gupta’s?     Yes.  And you know it at the time that Mr Bester gave evidence.  That is why I am trying to press you.  It must have been of concern to you.     I just want you to answer the question.     Alright.  So ...[intervenes]      Yes, thank you.  Mr Molefe, I assume that what must have concerned you though is when you came to learn of the context in which your name was used by Mr Essa.     Well, what Mr Bester said is not an assumption.     Mr Bester ...[intervenes]      Mr Bester said that Mr Essa referred to you and knew all about you and they knew you were going to become the next CEO of Eskom but it was in the context of him attempting to put pressure on Mr Bester to appointed Essa’s business as a supplier development partner.  Now when you heard that, that must have concerned you.       I am asking you, when you heard this in the Commission, it must have ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Sorry, Mr ...[intervenes]      Mr Molefe, Mr Essa was engaging in corrupt activity using your name.  Can you be quoted and say when you heard that it just did not concern you?  And then let us move to the next topic.     It did not concern you.  Correct?     Of course, it would concern you.  Correct?     No?  Well, I am not going to carry on ...[intervenes]       That was of course in 2015.      Alright, well if you just give me a second, of course, that was in 2015 where the Public Protector gave or made those findings in respect of the period when you were at Eskom.      Alright.      So how many times did you then, when you were Eskom, how often would you go to the Gupta’s was it more or less than when you were at Transnet? Transmit, just simply?      You do not know.      Yes.      It does seem from what I can see that things carried on where they left off, really.      From Transnet to Eskom we will come to that.      So there was a need for you, too, have a series of meeting.  I take it you would also meet with AJ Gupta then outside of the Saxonwold residence.       And was it as often?       And I take it that you would have reciprocated, then, when it came to entertaining the Gupta’s. It wasn't a one-way street, I mean they invited you to family functions, as you put it every time on each occasion, they would invite you sometimes you would go sometimes you would not.  I assume you reciprocated yourself.      Yes, and what sort of family functions would you have invited them to?      And how often would you speak on the phone to Ajay Gupta?      Now I am asking you Mr Molefe.      No but you see is it that you do not know or you do not want to assist us?  I mean, you are a very intelligent person and your contact with the Gupta’s it does not just arise now…[intervene]      No sorry but if you do not mind me finishing please, there is something that you…[intervene]      Mr Molefe it is not my intention to patronise you and if you interpreted my question that way, I do apologise.  But what I really want to get at is for you simply to tell us, do not worry about the Public Protector, you have got your concerns about her report, and you say it is wrong. I am asking you, during the time that you were the GC of Transnet those four or five years, typically, how often would you speak to Ajay Gupta on the telephone?  Now, we have managed to deal with how often you visited the compound, we want to get a sense, please from you.       As to how often you would speak to him on the phone.      And I assume you would accept you spoke often.      Now, Mr Molefe I think you might have touched on this before that was the evidence of Mr Jonas, I think it also featured in the Eskom stream.      Mr Jonas, where his commenting on a meeting that he attended with the Gupta’s and he said that Mr Gupta…[intervene]      Mr Jonas, this passage was put to you from what I understand during…[intervene]      Just if you bear with me, Mr Jonas goes to a meeting with the Gupta’s…[intervene]      They offered him the position of Finance Minister.      Alright.      Alright, so and I think you might have already referred to this in passing, but I just read      I have actually reflected on that answer of yours, and I really do not understand it, because it is not about whether you needed the Gupta’s.      I mean firstly one, they may have needed you.      Ja, I have reflected on the evidence that you gave and the answer that was published in the newspaper.  Where it was reported, as you say, look, I do not need people I have got a lot of experience and I had my career path.     But that is not the issue here.  You accept that perhaps the Gupta’s needed you.      Mr Molefe this passage really does show that you were very much in the Gupta camp.      Nobody is ridiculing you, the attempt is to get your input on how you see things based on what you know and it is up to you to say, but I hear what you say, Mr Jonas said, but I would say this Commission should reject that evidence of Mr Jonas, because there are two witnesses who deny what he says happened, that kind of thing that is the response.      Alright, was there a time when you stopped going to the Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s?      Did you there up until they fled to Dubai?       Yes, but what caused you to stop going there?      Sorry?    Thank you.      Well I cannot be the odd one out I suppose.    It is Mr Molefe’s narrative.    Thank you.  So you are not able to put a date even an approximate date when you stopped going to the Gupta residence?    When you look back having heard the evidence that has been presented in this – this commission do you feel at all betrayed by the Gupta’s?  Do you feel that you were perhaps played by them?    That is how perhaps I think is perhaps a different question.  What is your answer to whether you feel betrayed by the Gupta’s is it yes or no?    So you do not feel betrayed by the Gupta’s?    Sorry.    Mr Molefe that is why I do not really understand your answer.  Assume for a moment that they did what they did and there you were at the Gupta compound; there you were a friend of theirs.    On your version they were not being transparent with you; they were not telling you what was happening; they played you.  Do you not feel betrayed at all by them?    Mr …    But Mr Molefe.    You are not answer my question because you – again go into your culpability.  I am not asking you about your culpability.  Let us assume for a moment that you completely innocent and you did not know anything about this my question is, surely you must feel betrayed by the Gupta’s?      There assuming for a moment that they were involved in large scale money laundering from the very business that you were in charge of and they did not tell you this and you fostered this four year relationship.  It seems to me the obvious answer must be to the Chairperson I was – I cannot believe that these people did this to me I feel betrayed.    And certainly it was my intention to put it in that qualified way.    Mr Chairperson.    So –     I am going to try and put my question again.    Mr Molefe then we need to move on.  I am going to ask you to try and make a distinction between your culpability and the fact that you feel …    That you feel you were shot down by the Public Protector that is all I am dealing with now.  Let us assume that you are completely innocent.  Let us assume for a moment that the Gupta’s were involved in large scale money laundering from your business.  And we know that you were friendly with them surely then you must feel betrayed by them.    Yes.    So can we record that you do not feel betrayed by the Gupta’s – short point?  Correct?    And you do not feel betrayed by the Gupta’s?    Alright thank you.    Yes thank you.  Mr Molefe when you – when you look back at your time as the GCE of Transnet perhaps with the benefit of hindsight is there anything that you would have done differently?    What?    Alright you should have stayed.  Is that the only thing?    Because I just wanted to put to you you know there has been evidence by Dr Molefe, people like Mr Fulmink who have explained..    Popo Molefe.    I understand so – sorry have I got it mixed up?    Oh alright no I am talking…    You can properly be assured I am not referring to your father.    Let us deal – it is Popo Molefe he has given evidence and he has filed an affidavit where he has explained the radical remedial action that had to be taken within Transnet to right the ship in the wake of you and then Mr Gama being the GCE.    That radical remedial action had to be taken.    Well Mr Fulmink at a simple level came and explained the changes that had to be made to the PPM the Procurement Procedures Manual so as to learn lessons and to adapt from what had gone wrong in the past.    Yes.    Well I am going to come to his evidence in time about confinement, single source contracts, confidential confinements.  Many things that you were involved in but as I understand it I ask you that question – I ask you to introspect and to tell the Chairperson whether you would have done anything differently or better and what you say to us is well actually you would have just stayed there longer.    Yes I am not just talking about the operational side Mr Molefe.    Alright.    And what about other parts of the business?    I beg your pardon.    Now…    Mr Molefe turning to a different subject you received many …     Thank you.     I think it is fine Chairperson.     Thank you.  Mr Molefe, I wanted just to change gears now and perhaps deal with the market demand strategy.  I think you were speaking about that a little earlier?     Just for the purposes of the record.  I will just ask you to confirm.  As I understand it, it is a R 300 billion, seven year capital investment programme that sought to expand South Africa’s rail, port and pipeline infrastructure and the majority of that investment was targeted at Freight Rail Operations.  Is that correct?     And as I understand it.  It was announced in April 2011 and shortly after you joined Transnet.  Is that right?     With the investment commencing in April the next year.     So by the time you left Transnet or was three years into the MBS?     And I assume that the MDS must have been amongst your most important tasks, the running of that strategy, that programme?     And I assume it must have been a very exciting initiative to be in charge of an organisation that had such massive funds available to – for investment and expansion?     And I suppose also onerous?  I mean, it brought with it a lot of responsibilities on your shoulders, correct?     And then also by way of an introductory topic.  I just want to ask you a few questions about the BADC and delegations of authority.  As I understand the evidence, historically the Board of Directors including sub-committees did not have any delegated authority for procurement related activities.  There would have been a decentralised procurement system in place?   And this then changed in 2011 with the board acquiring procurement powers and a special sub-committee of the board being created, the Board Acquisition and Disposal Committee, the BADC.  Is that a fair summary to the best of your knowledge?     Alright.  Well, the evidence that I have seen says that in 11 the board acquired procurement powers and the BADC was established.     In 2011.  I presume it might have been before you joined.     So ...[intervenes]      Yes.  So do I understand your evidence to be that by the time you joined Transnet ...[intervenes]      ...the BADC was already there.     Some of the stuff that I have put to you might have been before your time.     Then as I understand the evidence in step with the MDS, BADC’s approval authority was increased in 2012.  I think it went up to R 2 billion with the board being required to approve tenders above this.       ...your recollection?     I do not know.  It is from the evidence that I have read.  But does that accord with your recollection that the BADC’s authority was upped to R 2 billion in 2012?     Alright.     Yes.  No, I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with this.  I am just – as we go into the big procurement tenders, just by way of background, I wanted to deal with the MDS and BADC and delegation of authority.   What we do know, as you have already accepted is, is that Mr Sharma was then appointed as the chairperson of the BADC in August 2012.       Then in 2013, the evidence that has been led, is to the effect that there was delegated authority to certain individuals to approve high-value transactions.  The CFO up to R 750 million and you in your position as the GCE up to a billion.  You remember that?     And effectively what happened is, you became – and this is the term, I do not use in the pejorative way, but one-person acquisition council.       You disagree with that?     Alright.  And why do you disagree with that?     Alright.  We are going to come to the relevant contact in a moment.  And you are right.  Most of them reflect various levels of recommendation or in some instances Mr Singh recommending and you signing.  We will come to that.  What we also know from the evidence is that both the BADC and you and Mr Singh within your authority had the power to award tenders on a confinement basis.     Yes.  No, I accept that.  But you had the power?     Alright.  Now what Mr Foreminck(?)     Mr Foreminck.     Yes, the Corporate Governance person.     He testified that the one-man acquisition councils and the widespread use of the confinement process were amongst the areas of concern or problem areas that he had identified ...[intervenes]      ...which had sought to address in the new updated PPM.  Do you accept that that is something that happened?     Yes.  No, I understand that but he is one of the people that I referred you to just now, that looking back at what happened, Mr Foreminck gave evidence that these are changes that we made.  We looked to tension up and improve the system.  I take it you do not dispute that evidence?     So for much of my questioning of you and I am going to really be dealing with your involvement in the procurement of goods and services at Transnet in that context, context of the MDS, context of the BADC and the delegation of authority.     Alright.  Now I want to start off by asking you some questions under the heading of Procurement of Consulting and Advisory Services.     No, I think it is a connection of different contracts ...[intervenes]      ...which you ...[intervenes]      ...you become – you are familiar with Mr Chairman.     So most of my questioning relates then to procurement and I want to start off by Procurement of Consulting and Advisory Services and I want to start with the one, the 1061 transaction, advisor contract, the McKinsey consortium.   Now what the evidence says – and Mr Molefe, along the way I am going to summarise it for you and you can agree or disagree.  A lot of this is really just background to the point that I want to get to.     The evidence is to the effect that given the magnitude of the 1064 Locomotive transaction, Transnet procured, we know, transaction advisors, effectively external consultants ...[intervenes]      ...to provide advisory services in respect of four different things.  Firstly, the validation of the business case.  Secondly, technical evaluation and optimisation and bids.  Thirdly, deal structuring and finance.  And then fourthly, procurement advice and legal services.  Does that accord with your recollection?     Alright.  And what we then know in relation to the 1064 transaction, advisors contract, is that in May or the 30 t h of May 2012, Transnet issued an RFP to nine consortiums on a confinement basis. Do you remember that?     [Indistinct]      Ja, I do not dispute that.  I am...[intervenes]      I am not suggesting for a moment and perhaps I need to also make this point.  I am not suggesting that there was anything wrong in what transpired.  I am trying to get to the point of which I want to question you about.       So what we know is that an RFP is issued to nine consortiums on a confinement basis.  And I am not suggesting that there is anything irregular about that.     What then happened is.  On the 27 t h  of July, the contract is awarded to the McKinsey consortium.       And it included – it was the main bidder and it included as a co-bidder and ST partner a concern by the name of Letsema.  Do you recall that?     Well, I am going to come to the problem in a moment.       Then what happens is.  On the 27 t h of August, you approved a memorandum from Mr Sing, advising that Letsema had a conflict of interest and proposing that it be replaced.  You remember that?     So if I can ...[intervenes]      If I could ask you, please, to turn to your file, Exhibit 22.     Ja.     Bundle 5.  I beg your pardon.  Exhibit 22.     Five...  Sorry, 405.1.       405.1.  Yes.  Mister ...[intervenes]      Mister ...[intervenes]      405.1.  Mr Chairperson, I undertook to ...[intervenes]      ...Mr Molefe’s lawyers to point out to you that from 405.1 through to 405.94, these are documents that were recently added to the bundle.  For some reason, there was a problem with the transmission of these documents and I understand that Mr Molefe might only have received them last night.       The agreement that we have is that I will point that out to you, place it on record.     When I take Mr Molefe to a document, I will place on record too that it is a new document.  And obviously, if he needs time to reflect on his answers more carefully, we are more than prepared to give it to them him.     And we would also like to just express our gratitude to him and his lawyers for not making an issue of this in the interest of proceeding with matters.     So Mr Molefe, we had got to the memo of 22 August and this – this it is.  You will see if you go to page 405.4 that it is sent to you or various levels of authority but ultimately you see Mr Singh recommended and then you ultimately approved it on the 22 n d of August 2012.  Correct?     So this was a month or so after the contract had initially been awarded to McKinsey.  I just want to go, if I may, to the purpose of the memorandum at     Sorry?     Right?     Right.     But why did ...[intervenes]      Alright.  But ...[intervenes]      No, that was the – that is the difficulty.  I do not see that.     Well, two questions though.  I mean, firstly, why was that not picked up during the tender evaluation process? MR     And secondly, why is it not recorded in here?     Well, look, it is not a lengthy document but of course I have no objection.  The other option, of course Mr Molefe, is that you could have a look at those overnight.  There might be other issues that arise and then we could deal with it again tomorrow if you want.     Alright.  So, and perhaps then we could come back to the two questions and that is.  Why was it not picked up during the tender evaluation?  And why is it not recorded here.     But let me take you to paragraph 15     The financial implications, you see McKinsey would get 35% of the value of contract and the     Alright.  So that is on the 22 n d of August.  What we do know, going forward in time, is that some four months or so later, on the 6 t h  of December 2012, Transnet in the form of Mr Singh and McKinsey conclude an LOI.  Do you remember that?  A Letter of Intent.  It is not in the bundle.  I will take you there.     Not in yours.  So let me just go through this and Mr Molefe, if there are documents that you want to see, then I will take you to them but then you must remember we have to go through those files behind you.  So let us go through the chronology and see if you recall.  So 22 August, we have got that letter.       22 August 2012, okay?     Now I am dealing with what happened.  So in other words, there is a recommendation which you approved that Letsema can be replaced.     What I am suggesting to you is that on the 6 t h of December 2012, Transnet in the form of Mr Singh and McKinsey conclude an LOI which reflects that Regiments had replaced Letsema.  And perhaps I should take you to that document given the importance of it because this is how Regiments comes on the scene.       6 December.     Just give me a moment, please.     Could you please go behind you to Exhibit BB-3A?     [No audible reply]      What we need is BB-3B.  So I think you have A, we need B.       BB-3B, page MSM-354.       Are you there Mr Molefe?     So there are two sets of numbering.  I am referring to the MSM number, top right hand, 354.       Okay.  so this is the Letter of Intent.  It dated the 30 t h of November 2012.  You will see the quality is really poor but what we can make out, if you go to page 358, is that on the 4 t h of December it was signed by Mr Singh.  And if you go over the page ...[intervenes]      358.     Ja, MSM-358.  It was signed by Mr Singh.  MSM-359, it was then signed by McKinsey on the 6 t h of December.     Alright. Now if you go to 354, you     And so that is how between the memo that you signed on the 22 n d of August and now, the 6 t h of December 2012, it is in that intervening period you see that Regiments then replace Letsema.  Do you see that?      Well they did it because the contracts are tainted, they would not have done that out of the goodness of their heart.      Mr Molefe please.      Alright.      You see now the importance of every time we determine involvement of Mr Essa it becomes important, does it not.      And to the Commission.      I just wanted to go back and ask you this. What I am struggling - and the great irony, I suppose insofar as you say you completely innocent is this started with you agreeing to Letsema being replaced.      Yes, Mr Molefe.      I do not think the Chairperson can hear you.      And you know you must speak to him.      Yes, I do and I mean, that I need to put to you that it started with a decision…[intervene]      I think it is, too close to the goats.       I think what is important and again, now I am being - in fairness to you I suppose whether you walked too close to the goats or whether you were complicit, cannot be determined on a decision by decision basis.  So you cannot say, well, let us say you know, I knew something about a crocodile and I did not do anything wrong.  What we going to, have to do at the end of your evidence is tally all of these things up and then ask the question.  Did you really not know, were they too smart for you, were you asleep at the wheel or were you complicit?      We have to decide that on all of the facts.      Absolutely.       Alright, so let us see if - could I just take you perhaps for the sake of completion to page 403 of the same bundle, bundle 5.  There is a media statement released by the Chairperson, you have read this I take it, 403.       Have you read this statement      And perhaps paragraph 1 captures it.  “McKinsey worked alongside Regiments Capital at Transnet and SAA on contracts that had been investigated by the Commission.  The Commission recently initiated discussions with McKinsey is now pleased to announce that McKinsey has undertaken to repay all of the fees paid to it for work it performed on the Transnet and SAA contracts, alongside Regiment.  The amount covered by McKinsey is undertaking has not yet been fixed with Transnet and SAA but is likely to be around R650million.” You see that?       I just want to go back before we go forward.  Did you, when Transnet agreed that Letsema be replaced by Regiments and that was a big change, not so.  Regiments, sorry Letsema to Regiments because if you look at it in the context of the contract, they were effectively a 30% partner, it is a big change, to move from one SD partner to another, not so?      But it is a big change.       No it was because…[intervene]      Oh, yes, absolutely.       Ja, because must speak about the money, I know.      But Mr Molefe…[intervene]      No, okay well, perhaps I need to finalise it.      Yes, no I think perhaps we at cross purposes, the replacement of Letsema with Regiments was a material change to the McKinsey Consortium.      You did not know about that?      Because you and I are at cross purposes I am afraid.  Can I just take you and see if we can cut through this for the purposes of moving on, can I ask you to go I think for the first time to bundle 6, to exhibit 27.      Are you there?  I want to take you towards the end of the file to page 380, three eight zero.      I think you might have the wrong file. This is one of the two Mr Molefe that I gave you this morning.      With your leave Mr Chairman, we will find that file because I know that I gave it to Mr Molefe because I gave it this morning, but there are lots of files.  My junior has another copy of this bundle perhaps for the sake of speeding things up.      Alright, so are you at page 380?      And you are familiar with the fact that…[intervene]      Alright, so Mr Molefe you familiar with these reports, in this bundle?       This page 380, you see at paragraph 2.4, there is the heading, the letter of intent related 6 December, we have spoken about that.  I am going to take you if I may to paragraph 2.4.5 and Mr Molefe you will also in, fairness to you I point out that these reports, of course, are not binding on the Chairperson.  They are just opinions of a particular entity.       But I will take you to it so that I can get you to comment on the propositions that I want to      Sub-seven     Yes.      Mr, Mr Molefe.      But why I laugh is no one is going to record what happened, I have told you what happened.  It is large scale criminal activity.       The meeting was called, and Regiments were told, we will appoint you but then you must pay Essa 30% of the fee.  That is not going to find its way into a memorandum.       Well, let us see what Mr Singh says but let me ask you this question.  Where was Regiments subjected to verification, evaluation and adjudication?      No, that is not what happened.  What the fact show is you decided that Letsema should be replaced. It opened the door for McKinsey to choose whoever they wanted, that was your decision.  Why did you not say that whoever you choose as a replacement for Letsema has to be subjected to the same verification evaluation and adjudication process, why did you not do that?       Why did you not provide when you took the decision that Regiments had to be subject to the same verification, evaluation and adjudication process as Letsema?  Why did you not provide for that in your decision?      You also had to apply your mind Mr Molefe.      That is not what I am asking.      Yes, Mr Singh is coming, he will no doubt deal with the questions that you have left for him and that I have got for him, too.  But Mr Molefe you see what the facts show is that Regiments actually became involved without any adjudication or evaluation or verification of them certainly not by Transnet, so just to let you…[intervene]      Mr Molefe it does not help you to say unless you can find a memo, the Commission has investigated this matter.  This is evidence that has been dealt with.  I am taking it to the MNS Report, they also investigated matters.  You cannot every time when faced with a difficult question, say that there must be a memo somewhere.  I mean, just so that you understand, on the face of it…[intervene]      Right, you know…[intervene]      But you were involved here directly you said…[intervene]      No, there was not, not on our investigation and research.      Mr Molefe if there was one, then we would have put it up.        I mean, I cannot swear that there is not one, but the point is, if you could just deal with this, why did you not apply your mind and say we cannot let McKinsey just replace Letsema with whoever they want?      I beg your pardon?      Why did you not provide for some evaluation process?  That is really all I am asking, the decision and it is a decision that you took.      Thank you.  So let us then move on. So that was a conflict that arose, Letsema we know is ultimately replaced by Regiments.  That happens between August and December that is 2012.  Now do you remember that a year later, in about November 2013 Regiments then replaced Nedbank, due to another conflict of interest.      November 2013.      Okay, well, perhaps tomorrow I will give you a copy of the letter because I have it in Mr Singh's file, but for the moment…[intervene]      Yes, he did.  So do you recall Regiments replacing Nedbank?      Well, perhaps Mr Singh was not as rigorous in the memo process as you were.  He signs the letter – but let me give you a copy tomorrow.      Ja.      Now…[intervene]      I think, yes, I think you could.  Thank you, Chairperson.      Mr Molefe look, I am going to give you this letter and obviously the Chairperson a letter…[intervene]      Mr Molefe just so that we locate ourselves I will give you the letter overnight, but dated the      No, you do not.      I am going to provide it overnight.      19 November 2013     Sorry?      Yes, because it was another big and important change, and you see how Regiments now becomes more dominant, not, so?      And of course, as it became more dominant, it charged more fees and the more the money laundering grew.  That is what you see from the money flows report, not so?      But you understand – do you see what was happening here.       Do you see what was happening here?      But do you understand now, that one's got to track Regimens, one must track carefully the decisions that were taken that enabled Regiments to come on the scene.  One must track carefully every extension of the scope of Regiments work, is that no so?      Do you accept that?      Here is Mr Singh's letter Mr Molefe.      That’s exactly the question that we are asking.      Yes precisely, but what you said now, which is important is that you knew nothing about this, correct?    Alright.          And what you also accept I suppose is every single contract which is concluded with Regiments must also come under microscope, correct?     And what we are going to see is – do you remember how many contracts you signed or tender confinements you signed in favour of Regiments, many?         We are going to come to them.        And in fact ...[intervenes]          Here in these bundles the document that there are.          And maybe unwittingly that you have seen from the money flows reports those contracts generated massive money laundering payments, the contracts that you signed, do you understand how one has to look at this carefully now under the microscope, Mr Molefe, you understand that?      And one is really only able to draw conclusions at the end, correct?      So let us then – just before I move on, you did know, as I understand your evidence, that Regiments, having replaced Letsema also went on to replace Nedbank, you knew that happened, but as I understand it you didn’t have anything to do with the decision.        Can you think why Mr Singh wouldn’t have engaged you over this decision because he certainly engaged you over the decision to replace – to have Letsema replaced.      But you see it is a phantom defence.      Okay, alright, so now we have got to November 2013, I am just following the chronology tracking this 1064 advisory contract.  There then came a time you may recall when McKinsey ceded its rights and obligations to Regiments, do you remember, on the 1064 contract. So just look at the steps, Letsema is replaced by Regiments, Regiments then replace Nedbank, McKinsey then cedes the contract to Regiments.  Regiments now becomes the primary contractor, correct?     In circumstances where there has been absolutely no verification, evaluation or assessment of it.          Well that’s one of the new documents from last night, so I just want to place that on record, but let’s go to that document.      Yes thank you.   Could I ask you please to go to Exhibit BB3[a], and if you could then turn to page – the numbers at the top, the MSM numbers, MSM175.  Are you there?     So this is a letter by Mr Segar from     You see that?     You see how it grew.     We are going to come to that because this is where you become directly involved, I am not suggesting necessarily that this is illegal, but what we know is that Regiments were conducting themselves illegally, they were siphoning funds from your business.  Do you understand what happened here Mr Molefe?     You know and I am going to put  parts of the McKinsey’s evidence to you,  You see this was around the time where the contract, the 1064 contract was coming to fruition and McKinsey in fact walked away from this, and they were replaced by Regiments and in this time they then came back subsequently.        Just bear with me.     Just bear with me for a moment. It was in this time between McKinsey leaving and when they came back that there was this massive increase in the ETC for the 1064 locomotives.     Sorry?     The ETC.   Let’s come to that.      The estimated total cost.     Alright.  So just tracking this so here we see 16 April McKinsey are saying look I have ceded rights and obligations, they are out in relation to the 1064 advisory contract, do you follow?  Regiment is now the dominant entity, correct?      Okay so let’s then have a look at your – now go please back to your file, Bundle 5, page 405.7.  This is also a letter that you received or memo that you received recently, you are more than welcome to take time to look at it more carefully.       Ja, 405.7.     Now this incidentally, remember the McKinsey letter is dated the 16 t h of April, this is a memorandum to you from Mr Singh, if you go to page 405.15.  You will see that he sends it to you on the same day, 16.04.14, do you see that?  Do you see that?  Mr Molefe?        Alright, and if you have a look at the recommendation.     Sub-line “note the deliverables executed by the transaction advisor on the locomotive transaction compared to the original scope...”     “...ratify the amendment in the allocation of scope of work from McKinsey to Regiments Capital.”     “3.  Ratify the amendment in the makeup of the transaction advisor consortium from Nedbank Capital with Regiments Capital.”         “Now the proven change in the remuneration model of the transaction advisor compared to the original remuneration model.”  Right?       Delegation power to the GCFO to give effect to the above proposal, right?     And now the fees?     I beg your pardon, approvals, thank you.  And the fees you see in the table above they were originally it would seem about 50million, what were they now?  What were their anticipated fees?     Alright, so you want to leave it there?     Ja.     Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]      Perhaps what I should also then do is point out to you what other documents are contained here, you will see that there’s a whole lot of CIPRO reports towards the end, not much reliance will be made on them other than pointing to a name or two, so could you go through all of them overnight and then we will come back to this memo and we are going to come back to the first one.     The documents that you were given last night are all the 405 documents, from 40591 to 40595.   You will remember that I asked you questions about the memo at 405.1 we are going to come back to that, and ...[intervenes]       405.1.     To 405.6.     And this is the second document that we will come back to, tomorrow. 405.7 and it is a long document that goes on.     I beg your pardon?     Well ...[intervenes]      Okay, alright.  Let us then ...[intervenes]      Can I just also indicate that from page 405.28 all the way to 405.95, so it is the bulk of the documents these are two CIPRO reports Chairperson where we will indicate to Molefe when we adjourn what we are using them for, it is really just a matter of showing that X person was a director and Y person was a director, there is a lot of paper here but it involves actually only two names.     Chairperson it would obviously be preferable to deal with those documents and get them out of the way, because as you have seen what I am trying to do, and I hope that it is helpful to you and the witness, is to build the chronology and see how this particular contract unfolded, so I am happy to go back to the documents, but it is not first price.   The other thing that strikes me is if we work too late then no doubt Mr Molefe is going to say he didn’t have an opportunity to look at the documents.     Yes.     Yes I did have a look at it briefly Chairperson, we don’t intend to say anything in response. 
OLDWADGE: Thank you Mr Chairperson good morning.   Mr Chair will note from the supplementary set of papers.   Since their receipt of the supplementary sets of papers. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Oldwadge is my surname, initials KC.   I am a member of the Johannesburg Bar I am instructed in this matter by Brian Kahn Incorporated Attorneys.  The two ladies seated to my right are in attendance with me.    Thank you.    Thank you Mr Chair might I then proceed?    Mr Chair.    Thank you.  There is of course the issue of condonation.    And I do not simply want to delve into the merits of the matter so to speak.    I do understand from my learned friend Mr Myburgh that on behalf of the legal team there does not seem to be any opposition to the condonation application.    The delay was in fact six calendar days.    Excluding Saturday and Sunday it would have been four week days Mr Chairperson.    And if you will permit me what we have done under enormous time constraints.    And I am not going to argue the condonation simply to place this before Mr Chair and I know of your hectic schedule to the extent that you have not considered there was a supplementary set of papers filed during the course of the weekend Mr Chair will note that due to a large part – my unavailability, various travels throughout the country and trials and so forth the founding affidavit did not perhaps not enjoy all the consideration that it ought to have and when I did have occasion to consider it during the course of – towards the end of last week I felt that we should supplement.    We – we – it appears as though it has not been filed in the bundle Mr Chair.  I note – I know that the legal team has been placed in receipt of it.    But we do have a copy of it together with annexures might we ask that it be received by you?  Might we approach Mr Chair?    Thank you.  Mr Chair so as not to waste time.    Thank you.    I know we are pressed for time.    Sorry Mr Chair.    As Mr Chair pleases.  I just did not want you to be saddled with loose papers because they are not stapled together and we apologise for that.    In essence Mr Chair I wish to make reference to the difficulties that our client and his legal team have experienced.    Indeed.    Indeed Mr Chair.    I appreciate Mr Chair ’s predicament.    It is indeed.  We thought it prudent that we would explain each and every single…    Whilst it is – it is not a substantial period of time I respectfully submit that we are required to address it.    Indeed.    Mr Chair    He was warned to be in attendance.    As from today but there is an informal arrangement.    Between Mr Myburgh and myself.    As we understood it there was a potential.    That he would be required to testify tomorrow afternoon.  I do not know what the position is now.    Mr Chair I do not wish to speak on behalf of Mr Myburgh but the indication that we received.    At least so that I am certain about this and clear.    Is that in relation to condonation per se as per the founding affidavit.    There was no opposition.    I do not know that their position has changed.    It is something I can canvass with Mr Myburgh.    Absolutely.    As you please Mr Chair.    Thank you.

PROCEEDINGS RESUME:  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Yes we are ready Chair.  What is to take place this morning is the cross-examination of Witness No. 3.    Legal representatives of Witness No. 3 are present as well as the legal representatives of Mr Gigaba who will conduct the cross-examination.   As the legal representatives of Witness No. 3 may apply if appropriate for re-examination in terms of the rules perhaps all should place themselves on record.    You would bear with me a moment.    Chair Witness No. 3 gave evidence at the same time as Witnesses No. 1 and Witness No. 2.  He gave evidence under an order of identity protection which we have loosely called in camera but properly regarded was an order which allowed him to give evidence where his identity was protected and you gave an order that that should occur.   Before summarising the evidence of Witness No. 3 may I just place on record?    Chair it is necessary to place on record because Witness No. 3 and Witness Nos 1 and 2 – Witnesses Nos 1 and 2 gave evidence relating to the same category of events as close protection officers and drivers of the various government officials and their relationships with the Gupta’s and the movement of cash from the Gupta’s residence – residences implicating various parties including Mr Gigaba.   On Saturday and this is a matter of public knowledge at the moment what the commission’s investigation team together with the securiated as advisors have concluded was a – an assignation attempt on Witness No. 1 and it is necessary just to place that on record.  The matter has been reported to the authorities and the security of all the three witnesses; Witness 1, Witness 2 and Witness 3 is being attended to. It is necessary therefore for the Order of Witness Protection to remain no further order is required from yourself.   But Witness No. 3 gave evidence Chair that over two periods of time and in various official capacities he was a driver and a security – close security protectional officer to Mr Gigaba and he relates his eyewitness evidence of what he observed when Mr Gigaba visited the premises of the Gupta’s in Saxonwold and how the events showed that Mr Gigaba was dealing with cash which Witness No. 3 concluded had come from the residence of the Gupta’s at the particular time. There were two periods one before 2009 and one in the mid – between 2010 and 2018 there around 2015 which are relevant to the evidence. It is necessary then for Witness No. 3 to take the oath once more.  Witness No. 3 is giving evidence remotely from a private location – undisclosed location put it that way.  Counsel who worked with me on the matter Verushka September is at present with Witness No. 3.  She will confirm that she is in the presence of Witness No.3.  Witness No. 3 can then take the oath and she will confirm that it is indeed to her knowledge Witness No. 3 that has taken the oath.    Noted Chair thank you.    Witness 3.  No Chair I am…    Chair if the witness is going to be referred to a report to which we have not had access we will deal with that.  I have just confirmed with the legal representatives of Witness 3 that the report referred to has not been drawn to their attention nor ours.     But for the rest the transcripts and the documentation relevant to the evidence.    The witness has in front of him.    Yes Chair there is a problem.  I have just looked at the page names are revealed on the page.    Which would be a gross violation of the order you make.    And in the circumstances.    This is a serious problem.    So – we object to that being put in without prior arrangements being made.    And my learned friend can come back and deal with those at a later stage.    Once there have been proper redactions.    But now already on public record there is a reference and names.    And it is just quite unacceptable.    So the matter we strongly object to anything of this sort coming before you today without proper arrangements being made for redactions.    Yes.  But Chair that does not solve the problem.    Which is that this a matter of – this document is the matter of public record already and the reference has been given so perhaps I should draw no more attention.    Apologies Chair just for the record.    It is Bundle BB14(d).    Bundle BB14(d).  The affidavit begins at page 122.  It is Exhibit 14D Chair.    It is a Transnet Bundle as I understand it Chair.  Perhaps I could let you have my copy.     Chair, a bundle was prepared for the particular purposes of this cross-examination.     It contains several documents.  It is SEQ-07/20201.  It is in the file that was given to you Chair and ...[intervenes]      And ...[intervenes]      Yes, I understand completely Chair.       But the bundle that my learned friend is referring to has certain references.  The bundle before you has other references.     But we can get a common reference at the bottom of the page which has the page of the transcript.     So if my learned friend can put his reference on record because that is important.     And then also put the page number at the bottom of the page, then we can all follow.     Sorry, Chair.  Just for the sake of clarity.  There seems to be some confusion between logbooks on the one hand and diaries on the other.  As I recall the evidence of Witness number 3 was that it was not that the logbooks and diary were unavailable that know what the position about the diary.  He said the logbooks were not available.  So I think the position should remain clear throughout.       Chair, given the implications of a certain line of questioning of my learned friend and certain innuendos contained in his questioning, to which I have an objection but I will deal with it off the record.     I need to place certain passages of the evidence on record to clarify the situation regarding the evidence of number 3, but in the meanwhile I think there is a request for re-examination from the representative of witness 3.     I will do that later.     So I will wash my hands.     Chair, firstly certain facts put in cross-examination need to be kept and we will check, there may be some inaccuracies that we need to place before you, but we’ll do that in due course after proper…[indistinct dropped voice]. Secondly, it’s unfortunate that my learned friend saw fit to raise the issues in the manner that he did without placing the full record before you.  We need to place certain matters on record. The way the legal team and the investigators work with any particular witness is that they form a team, and they all work together, sometimes separately but ultimately always together as a team.  Where a witness is not represented, the statement will be finalised by the team and will be, then sworn in an affidavit for presentation before you.  Now where the position is different where a witness is legally represented and the position in this case, as with all other cases where a witness is legally represented, the statement is placed before the attorneys, they check it, and they give the go-ahead that the affidavit can then be sworn.  Now, in relation to this joining the dots and the suggestion that this might have been suggested to the witness which the witness has denied.  I need to place the full text of the relevant evidence on record which I would have hoped my learned friend would have taken the trouble to do in fairness but be that as it may. On page 119 of 152 of the transcript, that’s SEQ07/2021 red number page 55, I just want to read the relevant passages.      Onto the record,      That’s a question from yourself.      Yes, Chair, so I’m not sure of the course of my learned friend’s …[indistinct dropped voice], thank you Chair. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Morning Chair.    It is Solomon RA SC I appear with my learned junior Mr Gumbi instructed by the State Attorneys’ office.    For the former Minister Mr Gigiba and we would like to avail ourselves the opportunity of cross-examining Witness 3.  We do not expect to be terribly long.    Thank you.      Thank you Chair.     Chair I thought about an hour should suffice.     Thank you Chair.     Chair I just wanted to enquire.  I am going to refer the witness to his statement and to a transcript of his evidence     As well as an extract from the Fundudzi Report that comments upon his employment.  Does he have access to all the documentation wherever he is?     Well we will    Thank you.     It was furnished to us from the evidence leader Mr Myburgh but – but I can – I can tell him what is in the report and if Mr Pretorius has any objection we can verify that.  It is – I will give the page number and I will – I will read the finding – one of the findings I think there are two in fact if that would be in order?     Should we proceed and see the     Yes.     Thank you Chair I place on record it is – is BB27 Bundle 2 page 272.  That is where the report is located.     Certainly.  It is BB27 Bundle 2 page 272.     Thank you Chair.  Perhaps then I can continue and in the background Mr Pretorius and perhaps Mr Myburgh because he –     He in fact had shared that bundle with us.     Yes Chair we have no – no difficulty I was never intending to – to reveal the identities through the report.     I just wanted to read a finding into the record.     But could we then just reserve.     The cross-examination on that point.     And perhaps we can – we could….     Certainly.     Chairperson it is – it is just to tell you Chair it would be simply to – to put to the witness this is what…     This was one of the findings…     Oh thank you.     Then just – just to tell you – Witness 3 I – the topics that I just want to touch on.   First would be your meeting with Mr Gigaba at the commencement of your re-employment.   Secondly I want to touch on the role you played as part of the security detail.   Then your evidence about the visits to the Gupta’s in Saxonwold.   Next to deal with the logbooks and the diaries that may take a bit of time. Then your evidence about visits by other parties at the same time. Then the question of the cash that you spoke about. Your evidence about the items of apparel that Mr Gigaba apparently purchased. Reference to Mr Molefe in your evidence and then also the timing of your complaint. And then we will reserve the question of the Fundudzi Report if we may? Now Witness 3 you have your – your affidavit that you furnished to the commission, do you have it?  I think it was dated 14 September 2020.  The witness could confirm that he – he has access to his affidavit.     His affidavit that he deposed to for the benefit of the commission the 14 t h of September 2020 Chair.     I wanted to refer you to paragraph 123 paragraph 10 – page 123 paragraph 10 of your Witness Statement.  Do you have that Witness 3?     And was it recorded in writing?     And has he given evidence in that regard, to your knowledge?     So again it is just your word that we have to accept that this report was made, is that correct?     I just want to put to you that Mr Gigaba denies having given any such instruction.  The issue of recording trips in a log book is a matter that fell within the authorities of the officers in their capacities as members of SAPS and in your case part of the security detail.  Do you want to comment?  Would you care to comment?     I certainly will.  I am saying Mr Gigaba denies that he gave you any such instruction, his evidence is that the issue of recording trips in the log book is a matter that fell within the authority of the SAPS and in your instance subject to your protocols, he did not instruct you or any of the other officers …[intervenes]     Thank you.  And he also says he did not instruct any of the other offices not to record any trip in their logbook, it was not his business to do so and he had no authority to do so.     Now of there were at least two vehicles at all times that accompanied the minister, is that correct?  One, the BMW and then your vehicle behind, is that right?     And the vehicle he was in, there would be log of the visits would there not, through the SAPS?  Do you agree?     Have a seen a log of those visits?     Have you ever enquired about them?     Okay, let us move on then, we will move on to another topic now.     Chair, I would say 15 to 20 minutes, if that would suit you?     Thank you, Chair, could I ask your indulgence to prompt me when the time is there.     Thank you, Chair.  Now you say that on occasions that you were with the minister at the Gupta residence you saw four individuals.  You mentioned Mr Molefe, Koko, Mr Ngubane and Mabaso.  Do you agree?  Do you recall that?     Now Mr Gigaba denies that on the occasions that he went there, one or two occasions in that six month period that these individuals were there at any time that he was there between July and December 2013.  Would you care to comment?     Now he tells me – and I want to just put it to you, that in far as Mr Ben Ngubane is concerned, he only became the Chair of Eskom in 2016 as far as he can recall and that period in 2013, as far as Mr Gigaba is concerned, Mr Ngubane was an ambassador in Chile.  Would you care to comment?     And also by the same token …[intervenes]     Chile.     Thank you, Mr Chair.     And then by the same token Mr Mabaso only became the Chair of Transnet in either 2014 or 2015.  Do you care to comment on that?     Thank you for that, Chair.  Then if I could just take you to your transcript of your evidence, that is SEQ0721, page 53.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  I also just want to put on record, witness 3, that Mr Gigaba denies that on occasion that he was there as you testified that President Zuma’s convoy was there at the same time.  You can comment or you cannot comment, it is up to you, I am just putting that on record.     I interrupted you, continue?     Thank you.  Now let us move on to the question of cash.  You, on your version, attended with Mr Gigaba and the Saxonwold residence of the Guptas on six or seven occasions, is that correct?     And you say in an earlier period of time you also observed him at the premises of Sahara in I think 2004, is that correct?     Now you have also testified, I have seen from your testimony and your statement that you observed a number of people, I do not need to call out their names, we know who they are.  On various occasions, carrying bags with money and then going to deposit that money at a vault somewhere, I am not sure where you described it, I do not think it is important.  Do you agree with me?     On none of the occasions did you ever see Mr Gigaba carrying – coming to or from either Sahara or the Gupta residence with a bag full of money, is that correct?     And on no occasion did you take into a vault and witnessing what you surmise to be the depositing of money, is that correct?  Do you agree?     Sorry, I did not hear that?     Yes.  Well, had you done so you would have remembered.     Yes.  So we can assume you never did, is that correct?     And then if we go to your witness statement, Chair, BB14d witness 1-3-126, paragraphs 25 to 28.  Does Chair have it?     25 and over the page up to 28.     You see, Chair, it is headed Cash Carried by Gigaba.     Does witness three have it?     Now you do not need to read that out, you can cast your eye over it.  There is no reference there in your statement to Mr Gigaba having collected or received any cash from the Gupta residence, is that correct?     Now could you then explain why in your evidence which we find, Chair, SEQ07/21 paginated page 55, typed page 119.  Does Chair have it?     I did, Chair, and 119, at the foot of the page, typed page 119.     Does witness 3 have it?     Now can you explain to the Chair why you were prepared to make that statement when you have admitted that you never saw him on six or seven occasions, as you did with other witnesses, collecting money from the Gupta residence, why were you prepared to make that statement incriminating my client with no evidence whatsoever?     But you had six or seven occasions to observe him, as you observed other witnesses, and you have confirmed that on none of those occasions did you see him taking a bag into or coming with a bag out of the Gupta residence or observing that he was taking cash from there.  You have conceded that.  Do you agree?     I want to know why you were prepared to come to this Commission and speculate and draw conclusions adverse to my client to incriminate him without any evidence whatsoever.  I would like you to explain why you felt that was part of your function coming to give evidence before this Commission.     Thank you, Chair.      And you did not voice that suspicion in your statement.  I take it your statement was taken in consultation with one of the evidence leaders, perhaps Mr Pretorius, Advocate Pretorius, and is that correct?  Is it correct?     So what we need to understand, witness 3, is at the time when you made your statement, your affidavit for the purposes of this Commission, you did not voice any suspicion and you had not connected the dots, is that correct?  Is that correct?     I beg your pardon?     What made you then voice it during your evidence, your oral testimony?     So you had forgotten about your suspicion when you did your statement, is that correct?     And you only connected the dots when you gave your testimony, is that correct?     Did anyone assist you in connecting those dots between the time that you gave your statement on the 14 September 2020 and when you gave your evidence?  Do you have an answer?     Right.  You have said that Mr Gigaba appeared nervous to you when he was – exited the vehicle, is that correct?     But he was not in your vehicle, how could you have observed that?     And was this on all occasions, on the six or seven occasions he would jump out and sprint to the front door?     Only once?     Well, Mr Gigaba denies that he was nervous on the one or two occasions that he would have gone there during that period or that he ever sprinted out of his car.  You do not have to comment, I am just putting to you what his version is.     I was hoping you would not but I understand that you are…     Ja, thank you.  I just want to put to you – sorry, quite an important question, just describe the bag that you say you saw in Mr Gigaba’s – the boot or trunk of his car that had the money you say you saw?     A travel bag.  What do you call a travel bag?  Is that one of those bags on four wheels that we see in port and people boarding planes with as part of their hand luggage?  I see you are smiling behind the mask, Chair.     Touché, touché, but you are a lawyer too, Chair, in the broader sense.     Yes.  I was asking you, witness 3, when you say it is a travel bag, just so we can understand, is it one of those bags we see people on aeroplanes with on – that have normally four wheels and a handle and you wheel them onto an aircraft.  If that what you call a travel bag?     It is different to a sports bag.  Not the same thing, do you agree?     Sorry, I spoke over you, do you agree?     Well, I have got to wrap up but I am just going to put the references, we will not go there, to save time, but you have described, page 249, line 7 to 8 – sorry, that would – let me give the correct reference, Chair.  That would be SEQ07/21, page 56.     2021, sorry, Chair.     Page 56.     Typed page 120.     You then – this will just be my last submission, you describe it there at line 7 to 8 as the bag you saw as a sports bag.  Does chair see it?     I understand.     But we have got on record that in his words it was different to a sports bag.     But we will leave that for you, Chair.     I just want to say to you that he denies he carried large sums of money with him and if on occasion he paid for a meal, he may have had some cash with him but he certainly was not carrying large sums of cash.  You can comment or not but I am just putting that on record, witness 3.     Chair, bearing in mind the time constraints I have more questions but I will defer to the Chair now.     As they say in the senate I will yield back to Chair.  Thank you, Chair.     I will discuss with Mr Pretorius.     Thank you, Chair.    Thank you – thank you Chair.    Chair I just wanted to put on record one aspect flowing from my questioning that flowed from a discussion I had with Mr Pretorius about the connecting of the dots and anyone that witnessed that he may have spoken to.  There is absolutely no suggestion from either me or my client that Mr Pretorius or any member of this commission would have been – would have spoken to him or encouraged him to connect any dots and that was not the imputation of what my line was.    Thank you Chair.    I – yes I think so.    I think it was about an hour.    Yes.    Maybe you owe me five minutes but we can talk about that some time Chair.    Chair I have been – I am guided by the Chair.    I am not – I am not complaining that we could not do what we needed to do.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV DUBE: Thank you Chair and good morning.  The name is…     Okay so if I understand you ...[intervenes]      The trips to the Gupta residence, Chair.     So, witness 3 if I’m to summarise your evidence in this regard, you are saying the logbooks, the trips were recorded on some occasions until the Minister instructed you not to record them and from that point, they were no longer recorded but with regards to his diary, the trips were never recorded?     Thank you.  Now, moving onto the next issue which relates to the six or seven visits to the Gupta residence.  You’ve mentioned that, on one of these trips it is you who was driving the Minister?     And that there was no-one else in the vehicle?     And it was put to you that, that would be a breach of protocol, do you recall that?     Was this an unusual occurrence for you and the Minister to drive together?     But how would that occur if you were only meant to be driving the back-up vehicle, can you clarify that to Mr Chairperson?     Thank you Chair.  Now, witness 3, going back to these six or seven incidents, why are you certain that it was six or seven times you went to the Gupta residence because Mr Gigaba says it was only once or twice?     So, you know that it’s six or seven times because on different occasions when you were there with the Minister you saw different people?     And  think, Chair, he also mentioned there was an occasion where there was a dinner, and he took the Minister ’s wife.     Thank you witness 3. Witness 3, the propositions or what has been put to you is that Mr Gigaba denies most if not all of the averments that you have made in your statement, he denies that your evidence is true.  Essentially the inference to be drawn from that is that what you have placed before this Commission is a fabrication.  Now, are you aware of what happened to witness one over the weekend?      Are you aware of the reports, thank you Mr Chair, are you aware of the reports relating to witness one, over this weekend?     Now, you’ve also requested that you should testify in private, behind camera, is that correct?     And part of that was to safeguard your identity as you are of the view that your life might be in danger.     Now, given all of this knowledge, more so regarding the reports about witness one over this weekend, why would you put your life further in danger by fabricating evidence against the Minister or the former Minister Gigaba?     Chairperson, thank you, those are all the questions I have for witness 3.     Thank you. 
ADV DUBE SC:  The name is Sibusiso Dube from Bowman’s Chair and I am representing Witness No. 3 in these proceedings. 
MS SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair I am. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   May I proceed Chair?     Does Witness 3 have the affidavit?     Yes.     Thank you.  Now I just want to put to you what Mr Gigaba says in regard to your allegation that you met with him at the commencement of your employment around – prior the commencement of your employment in April 2013.   He says that his security details were dealt with his Chief of Staff, Mr Thani Mesome and he did not get involved in the recruitment process of the discussions with you, as you say.   He denies that he had any meeting with you.  All of these arrangements would have been attended to by Mr Mesome.  Do you agree with him in that regard?     Alright.  Now in paragraph 16 of your affidavit, you will find that at page 124, you say that Mr Gigaba would travel in the BMW vehicle with two SAPS VIP Officers and your vehicle would follow.   So you were part of a security personnel in the back of the motor vehicle as you were not a member of the SAPS at the time.  It would have been improper for you to have travelled in his vehicle in that capacity.  Do you agree?     And as such, you did not have access to the principle motor vehicle.  Is that correct?     Now if we could then move on to the next topic of the number of visits to the Gupta’s.  You say that he visited between the period that you were employed in the capacity that you have described, like, a period of six months, from July to December 2013.  You have said on about six or seven occasions.  Is that correct?     Now you say to that.  On one of the occasions, you drove Mr Gigaba alone.  Now how did that come about?  Would that not have been a most serious breach of protocol that we have just agreed upon a few moments ago?     So now you ...[intervenes]      Sorry?     I interrupted you.  Had you finished?     Yes.  But would that not have been a breach of protocol?  You were not a member of the SAPS and you were not authorised to drive Mr Gigaba anywhere.     Do you agree?     And would you just slavishly follow his instructions even though it would be a breach of your employment conditions and the SAPS protocols?     Alright.  I just want to put to you that Mr Gigaba denies that you ever drove on any occasion, let alone to the Gupta residence.  Would you like to comment?     I also want to put to you that he denies that he visited their residence on a number of occasion that you describe and that at the most it would have been once or twice during that period of time.  Would you like to comment?     Certainly Mr Chair.  Should I continue?     Now, of course, the way of testing your evidence against Mr Gigaba’s on a number of visits would be to have regard to the diaries and logbooks because they would provide the independent and objective evidence.  Do you agree with me?     Of course, the way to resolve the dispute between you and Mr Gigaba about the number of visits to the Gupta’s residence in Saxonwold would be to have regard to the objective independent in the form of his diary and your logbook.  Do you agree?     Were any of these visits that you have testified about now recorded in Mr Gigaba’s diary?     Could I refer you to your evidence?  It is at Bundle 2, BB-24, page 244, lines 22 to 25.     Chair, whilst you ...[intervenes]      Chair, it is BB-24-244, lines to 22 to 25.     Yes.  Mr Chair, Mr Pretorius is telling me that I should use the SEQ-07/20201-51 reference.     If I could just place it on record again Chair?  It is Bundle SEQ-07/20201.     That is in order then Chair.     I will also just try and follow my learned friend’s page numbers but then it is ...[intervenes]      Yes.     It is SEQ, page 51 and it is typed page 115.     Yes.     Yes.     It is page 51 ...[intervenes]      Well, I will give both numbers.  It is page 51 of that bundle and it is typed page 115 at the bottom of 152.     Do you have it Chair?     Yes.     Now you were asked there    That was on some of the occasions?     But on other occasions not.  And were they recorded?     Sorry, I did not hear?  Did you say that is correct?     Now if you go to page – your affidavit at page 125, 20.1.     It is BB-14 ...[intervenes]      Sorry.     Yes, Chair.  And can I just say to, perhaps Chair, without being prescriptive to you and Witness 3?       It would be useful of both of those bundles stay open all the time because I am just going to move between them.     And so...     Just ...[intervenes]      I shall.     I understand.     I understand Chair.     So it is BB-14(d) ...[intervenes]      Witness [1-3-125].     And – well, 125 is the page number.  It is paragraph 20.1.     Do you have it Witness 3?     It is at the foot of the page, 20.1     So is that what – is that evidence incorrect?     Because we understand from what you have just old the Chair now that not all the trips were recorded but some were.  Now you are saying none were recorded.  And you realise the importance of having a record of these visits.  So we have an objective, an independent mechanism to test the veracity of your evidence.       Would you care to comment?     So let me just try and sum up your evidence.  You have said on various occasions...  I have shown you what you initially said.  Is that these visits were recorded and they were handed over to Witness 1.   Then you have said some were recorded, some were not.  Then you have said in your statement that I have just read to you, none of them were recorded because that was the instructions of the Minister.   And now you are also telling us that we cannot verify and test your evidence because the logbooks are nowhere to be found.  Is that correct?     Certainly Chair.     So let me just try and summarise your evidence in each part.  You have said initially that there was a log and a record of the visits and they were handed over to Witness 1.  Do you agree?  We have gone through that in your evidence.     Then you have said that, in your oral evidence this morning, questions from the Chair that some of the visits were recorded, others not.  Do you agree?     Then you say in your statement that we have just looked at, paragraphs 20.1 and 20.2, that none of the visits were in fact recorded.  Do you agree?     But then your statement is wrong, your affidavit, paragraphs 20.1 and 20.2.     Thank you.  And then we know that you say the logbooks and diary are not being produced for this Commission because they are not available.  Is that correct?     So at the end of the day, we have just your word against Mr Gigaba’s word.  Is that correct?     But in any event, on your version, they were not recorded in the diary of the Minister on his instruction.  Is that correct?     So if I could again just put my proposition.  We only have your word against the Minister ’s world for this.  We have no way of testing your version against the objective evidence.       Yes ...[intervenes]      So in the absence of the logbooks and the diary, we only have your word for it as to the number of visits that occurred?  Do you agree?     Do you agree Witness 3?     Well, the ...[intervenes]      And then just to refer you to your evidence at page 116 ...[intervenes]      So it is again Chair ...[intervenes]      It is SEQ-07/2021 at paginated page 52 and typed page 116.  Does Chair have it?     It is the SEQ-07/2021 Bundle, paginated page 52, typed page 116.     Does Witness 3 have it?     And you will see about line 14,     Yes.     Thank you Chair.     And the confusion relates to whether it was on all occasions that there was no record or whether there was indeed some occasions where there was a note made either in the diary or the logbook.     But you do not need to respond.  I think you have responded. Now in regard to this instruction, did you not feel uncomfortable about breaching your standing orders concerning logging or trips that you were involved in, in the vehicle on the instruction of the Minister?  Did it not strike you as something you should not adhere to, that instruction? 
MR DUBE:   Thank you for the indulgence, Chair.     I should not take long at all, Chair, I think there is probably about three issues that I need to clarify with the witness, Chair.     I think let us say 15 minutes, Chair.     As it may depend on his responses as well.     Chair, apologies, I seemed to have lost the page that I marked.     Certainly, Chair, thank you.     Witness 3, good afternoon.     Are you well?     I think I am in a better place than you are, so certainly thank you for availing yourself to us.  Witness 3, the first issue that I would just like you to clarify relates to the logbooks and the minister ’s diary.  Can you just clarify to the Chairperson, when you refer to logbooks and diary, what it is that you are referring to?     Now let us go to SEQ7/2021 on page 52.     Thanks, Chair.  Witness 3, let us move to SEQ07/2021 on page 52.  Just let me know when you are there.     Alright.  Now there was a lot of questions that arose from your evidence in this regard and I think maybe I will just read from line 12 on page 116 of the transcript, it is page 52, SEQ07/2021 and when I am done reading I would just like you to clarify to Mr Chairperson what the actual position is with regard to this evidence.  Okay?  So I will start on line 8 with Adv Pretorius who says yes and 
ADV MYBURGH:   Ten minutes is perfect, thank you.     Yes, thank you.  Mr Molefe, perhaps we live in different world but …[intervenes]     I just want you to know that it may very well be that the submissions that I make to the Chairperson at the Eskom – sorry, the Transnet stream evidence will be that many of your answers are simply contrary to natural human behaviour and perhaps the submission would be, and I am giving you an opportunity to answer it, is you are doing this, you are presenting these unnatural answers because what you are really trying to do is at all costs to distance yourself from the corruption.  That is why you are doing this.  Do you want to comment on that?     Alright.  So let us then deal with your ties with the Guptas.  Just before I move on, do I understand that you seemed at least a bit surprised when I told that Mr Essa was seen by Mr Gama at the Transnet offices holding meetings?     Well, then you must have been shocked to the core when you heard Mr Bester ’s evidence that said before the meeting that Bester had with Essa or he made the comment, he had a prior meeting with Essa and Singh.     Mr Singh.     They same place they met with you at Melrose Arch, Mr Molefe.     That Mr Essa met with Mr Bester when they discussed you, it was in Melrose Arch.  They had had an earlier meeting in Melrose Arch, Bester and Essa, present at that meeting was Mr Singh.     That must have shocked you when he heard …[intervenes]     The meeting preceding the meeting that Mr Bester gave evidence about where the comment was made about you becoming the next CEO of Eskom.  Did it surprise you or not?     Yes.     Yes.     I am not asking you that and that is not an answer.  You must have been – if you were surprised when I told you that Gama says that he saw Essa at the Transnet offices meeting with Mr Singh, if you were surprised by that how can you not have been surprised by Bester ’s evidence that said that he met with Essa and Singh?  You must have been surprised.     Now, Mr Molefe, I am not sure that I understand all of that.  Let me just go back …[intervenes]     Yes, but you did have a guilty conscience.     Because you did know what was going on.  Are you suggesting that you did not know at all what Mr Essa and the Guptas were up to, that they were – on the evidence that has been presented to the Commission they were engaging in money laundering using the business that you were in charge of.  Are you suggesting you did not know that?     I am asking you, did you not know?     You did not know at all/     And to make it worse, the people that were actually the perpetrators, they were friends of yours, the Guptas.  We are going to come to that now.  So, Mr Molefe, just so that you understand the context in which my questioning of you takes place, many …[intervenes]     No, let me -  sorry, if you will just let me finish because I was in fairness going to tell you what I am going to examine you about.     Many Chief Executive Officers have been in your position before where it is found out that there is corruption and criminal activity under their watch.     That is what I am asking you, are you suggesting that you did not know?     Okay.  Alright, so then the question of course arises but why did you not know and how is that you could not have known?  Now in fairness to you, those are always hard questions for CEOs in your position to answer but in fairness to you, I need to point out that what makes your position so much more difficult is that you were friends with the perpetrators.  You were frequenting their house, you had a seat at the table, yet you say you did not know.  How is that possible?  Were you being played by these people?  Do you feel portrayed by these people?  Those are questions that we need to ask and need to be answered by you over the course of the next [indistinct – dropping voice] and I put that to you in fairness.  Now let us start this line of questioning by me asking …[intervenes]     Yes, so let us go back – let us start then with your …[intervenes]     Thank you.  So you previously testified in the Eskom stream that you knew the three Gupta brothers quite well.  You said especially Ajay, you said you had a lot of interaction with him, you said that you have been to the Saxonwold compound on numerous occasions, you said you have lost count now many times and when you were there you attended family functions and private meetings.     You remember that evidence?     And you said that whilst it is fashionable for people to say that they do not know the Guptas you were not one of those people.  So let us just start out by dealing with how often you went to Saxonwold.  You say that you have lost count how many times.  How many times did you go there?     Yes, on a let us say in average month how many times would you go there?     Come, Mr Molefe.     Yes but you …[intervenes]     So – sorry, Mr Chair.     Mr Molefe, please, I just want you to answer my question and then we can move on.  So in the years that you were the GC of Transnet, 2011 to ’15, in an average month, how many times would you go to the Gupta residence?     Yes.     Well, then let us make it in a six month period.     Well….     Once a month?     Over a five year period.     I am sure you went there more than that because that is only 60 times.     Sorry?     It seems that you went there even on those calculations very often but let me just ask you this or perhaps put to you this.     Well, I am going to use your own maths.  You say well, could be once a month, twice a month, whatever, but over a five year period that mounts up, Mr Molefe, it is on a – as you say, you have lost count how many times you went because you went there so often, not because you went there so little, correct?     No, that is fine.     Well, let us try and get …[intervenes]     Let us deal with some of the evidence and try and get to some of the maths.     Witness 1 says that he took you to Saxonwold 11 times in 14 months between July 2011 and September 2012.  Would you accept that?     But would you accept that you would have gone there …[intervenes]     Yes.     So that gets us to about once the month as you said.     Right.     No but you went there more than 11 times because witness 2 actually says that when he went there he saw you there, now not in your official car, but in your private car.  So do you accept that you would go to the Gupta compound, sometimes driven there …[intervenes]     Sorry, just – do you accept that you went there …[intervenes]     Alright, I think you may be right.  But do you accept that sometimes you went there in an official car, I call that a Transnet car, and on other occasions you went in your private vehicle, correct?     Alright.  So I just want to get a sense of when you say you attended family functions, what sort of functions would that be?     So whenever they had occasions they would invite you, correct?     Okay.  And you said that you would attend private meetings and I really want to just get a sense of during the time that you were the GC of Transnet, those four or five years, what sort of private meetings were you having?     Yes, but …[intervenes]     But, Mr Molefe, you see what I want to ask you about, are those meetings or are those friendly chats that you would have with your friends?  Would you really classify these things as meetings?     Alright, so let us deal with some other figures.     The Public Protector found that between August and November of 2015 you visited the Saxonwold area 19 times.  Do you remember that?     That is four months, 19 times.     Could that have been correct possibly?  Maybe when you are not following the linear approach, perhaps in these months you went there more often.     Yes.  I thought perhaps I had missed something very interesting.     Yes.     Alright.     Yes.     No, you see, Mr Molefe …[intervenes]     You said that to McKinsey, McKinsey did that.     It was McKinsey’s choice, it is not a Transnet choice.  So that memo that you are talking about is not what you see here.     This is McKinsey – and I am going to come and explain to you how it happened.     I am going to explain to you what happened now.  It is one of the startling pieces of evidence that have been presented in this Commission.  So the question then is, between the 22 August and the 6 December how does Regiments come to be appointed and I want you to consider this.  Have you come across and read the evidence of Mr Ian Sinton of Standard Bank given in this Commission?       So according to what was reported to Mr Sinton by a Mr Niven Pillay and other directors of Regiments, their appointment came about in this way, okay?  In October of 2012 Kuben Moodley arranged …[intervenes]     Yes, it was reported to Mr Sinton.     Ja, that is right.  But just bearing in mind the context.  Mr Sinton is from Standard Bank and he was investigating certain suspicious payments or transfers made out of Regiments’ account and that is how he comes to give this evidence.     Now, Mr Molefe, I am not – so that we do not cross swords, I am not suggesting to you that every piece of evidence that I am going to put to you is the gospel truth and that is what has to be found, I am putting to you that that is his evidence.     The Chairperson will have to decide in time whether to accept it but I am just apprising you of what the evidence is.     As to how Regiments comes on the scene.     Okay.  So Mr Sinton says that it is reported to him by these two Regiments’ directors that in October of 2012 Mr Moodley arranges a meeting between himself, Regiments and Mr Sagar of McKinsey and Mr Essa.  Okay?  So you have got …[intervenes]     No, Sinton is not there.     So what we have is two Regiments’ directors.     Okay and Mr Moodley arranges the meeting.     Mr Sagar is there from McKinsey and Mr Essa, who you know about but had not met was there.  He says that at this meeting Regiments were told that Transnet required McKinsey to appoint a black-owned supply development partner with 30% of the fees earned, as we have seen.     And McKinsey then offered to appoint Regiments as its SD partner, provided Regiments agreed to pay 30% of all of its income from Transnet to Mr Essa and 5% to Mr Moodley.  That is how Regiments came to be appointed.     I presume you do not know anything about that.     Alright.  Now you might also have read from one of the money flow reports that we will come to in a moment, that the money flows team does not necessarily consider Mr Pillay to be a reliable witness and questions his version about whether Mr Sagar was there, but considers it is possible that he is telling the truth.  So the concern is not about Mr Sinton, because it was reported to him, the question is whether Mr Pillay was telling the truth.  But what has been determined is that this is the manner in which Regiments came onto the scene and the understanding was that Regiments would then replace Letsema but with Regiments on the scene, the deal was that they had to pay 30%, which in time was up to 50%, of all their earnings on that contract to Mr Essa and 5% to Mr Moodley.  That was the evidence of Mr Sinton.     Yes.     No, you cannot comment, presumably.  Alright.  And then the rest is history because following Regiments’ appointment as McKinsey’s SD partner on the 64 advisory contracts and other contracts which we will come to in a moment, more than R200 million was transferred from Regiments to Gupta shell companies in payment of these fees.     Regiments would pay Gupta shell companies, for example Homix, you would have read about them.     Ja, so I suppose on the face of it really Mr Essa pulled off something of a heist on that evidence.  Every rand – because it was up from 30%, every rand that was paid to Regiments, they paid 50%, 50 cents in a rand to Mr Essa for doing nothing, just because of this introduction.      So it is now that I want to take you to one of the money flow reports, if I may.     Can I ask you please to turn to page …[intervenes]     Bundle 5, Chairperson and perhaps we need just to start with page 115.  Are you at 115, Mr Molefe?     That is correct, yes.     Okay.  So this is a 3.3 notice that was issued to you, you see it is dated the 18 November last year, 2020.     And you were advised – and this was issued in the run-up to McKinsey giving evidence.  You were issued with this notice and you were told at paragraph 4 the topics on which witnesses from McKinsey will be questioned and may implicate on the following and they list it and you referred there to annexures A and B.  Do you see that?     Ja,. paragraph 4 references annexure B – An and annexure B.  Do you see that?     And those are what we refer to as the two money flow reports.  The one report you find at page 120 and I am not going to go to; this now, I am coming to it, what I want to take you to though is the second money flow report which would have been annexure B and that you find at page 324.  Are you there?  324.  I think that is it there.     Ja.  Are you at 324?  So what this is, Mr Molefe, is a report that was drafted by the money flows team.     An investigator by the name of Lisa Moeller and it was a report that was part of the documents, formal exhibit before the Commission at the hearing of the McKinsey evidence.  I want to take you please to page 325.  Are you there?     This is a report done by – so there are various different streams within the Commission.      This is done by the money flow team.     Yes, well …[intervenes]     Well, I think you can accept that it is a report by the money flows team, it might make certain factual findings.     Well, it is certainly not – it is not a finding that the Commission has made, it is simply …[intervenes]     So, Mr Molefe, perhaps I can also explain to you that these reports were put before McKinsey, they were prepared in advance of McKinsey’s evidence.     And McKinsey accepted them because we will come to the settlement with McKinsey in a moment.     But there are just some aspects of this money flow report that I want to take you to and perhaps we can go through it in some detail.  At paragraph 1, they refer to their previous report which they say shows that Essa orchestrated the incorporation of Regiments as McKinsey’s supply development partner.       I have explained that to you already.     And then Mr Niven Pillay and another person of Regiments have repeatedly testified at paragraph 2 in civil litigation that the original arrangement reached between Regiments and Essa, this is at page 325, in this regard was that an entity nominated by Essa would receive 30% of all amounts …[intervenes]     I beg your pardon, I am at 325.      At paragraph 2.     I am sure it is probably my fault, Mr Chairman, I am sorry if I have led you astray.       I would have thought if anyone has learnt by now it must be you.     325.  So at paragraph 2 they record that these two people have repeatedly testified that an entity nominated by Essa would receive 30% of all amounts received by Regiments flowing from its position as McKinsey supply development partner at Transnet and an additional 5% would be paid to Albatime, a company of Kuben Moodley.     Who introduced Regiments to Essa.  I have explained that to you.  It is not clear whether this 30/5% arrangement was ever implemented, the cash flows analysed by the Commission show that the arrangement actually implemented by Regiments for most of the lifespan of the relationship with McKinsey was that Essa’s entities were ordinarily paid 50% of Regiments’ revenue from Transnet with Albatime being paid 5% Transnet’s revenue, leaving Regiments with only 45%.  And then they say at paragraph 3 …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, absolutely, yes.     Then it says at paragraph 3    Then they say at paragraph 5 or the     Now we get to a part that involves you     That is how bad it was.  I will show you the contracts.     So now Homis actually put up as a site     Ja.     Well, sometimes they would pay directly where they were the skills development partner.  We will come to the detail.  So in some instances …[intervenes] MR     In some instances what would happen is it would be McKinsey and Regiments, right?  And then the deal was Transnet would pay Regiments and then those amounts would be disbursed to Essa and Albatime through Homix, etcetera.       In other instances what happened is when McKinsey/Regiments put in a bid, Regiments put up Homix and Albatime as their skills development partners.     That is right.     Okay, so then have a look at paragraph     Nyonya.     Between Wood, Pillay and Nyonya.      “When Wood with a 32% interest in Regiments took the advisory unit with him to Trillian but gave up his interest on all other business units within Regiments.”     I am indebted to you, Mr Chairman.     Then there are two other paragraphs which I am going to deal with with Mr Singh in particular, we can leave those out for the moment but let us just go to     Now did you know about this?     Alright.  So at least on this report …[intervenes]     Yes, then.     Mr Molefe, so then on the face of this report what happened is that whilst you were at the helm of Transnet there was large scale money laundering happening under your watch using Transnet.  Do you see that?     Sorry?     No, fair enough.     I am saying that the Chairperson …[intervenes]     He must still decide.  That is why I specifically said to you on the face of this report.     I mean …[intervenes]     It would seem that it suggests that during the relevant time and during that relevant time you were Group CEO of Transnet there was large scale money laundering.     So – but he wants you in the end to say whether you have any comments, I just want to put that in context, his proposition in context.     No, absolutely and just – I mean, I am sure you will appreciate that the Commission is not able to make separate findings, you know, in other words it could not sign off on this and make a finding of money laundering and then we cross-examine you.  Unfortunately – or examine you – these processed need to run together.     But I am simply putting to you what – certainly it seems to me the money laundering scheme is going to advance to the Chairperson.     Okay.     Yes, no, that I appreciate but I suppose now you understand the context in which we have concerns about what the drivers have to say about senior executives having money.     Yes.     We will come to that.     But you do understand, just so that we – before we move on, that on the fact …[intervenes]     Just hang on, Mr Molefe.  On the face of this report Mr Essa and the Guptas are engaged in money laundering.     In hundreds of millions.  You understand that?     Yes, I am saying on the face of …[intervenes]     No, you are saying it seems so, I am saying on the face of the report …[intervenes]     Yes, but I want to make one point …[intervenes]     But I want to …[intervenes]     But there is a – you talked about a beating of the drum, this is not silent because one thing I want to mention to you is that McKinsey, you know, have conceded that all of these contracts were tainted.     And they have put their money where their mouth is, they have agreed to pay back 650 million in relation to these contracts and a contract at SAA.     That speaks volumes, does it not?     Yes, I understand that.     Do you want to comment on McKinsey having accepted that all the contracts are tainted where they worked alongside Regiments and on the basis have agreed to pay R650 million.     But you accept they did that. 
MR MOLEFE:  Thank you Chairperson.    Brian Molefe.    I have no objection.    I truly affirm.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    It is indeed Chair.    Yes it is so.    Yes we might have to do that because I am a little uneasy about saying all the documents are…    Chair if I may ask a question?  I see in those investigation reports some of them have a heading called Findings.    I just wonder as a layman what the meaning of findings (inaudible).    No, no in the commission’s report.    I think we will deal with them when we get to them.    Indeed Chair.    Yes indeed it is correct Chair.    I think that was February Chair.    April was the – April was Eskom.    2015.    Yes.    No it was for a period of over five years.    Because when I went to Eskom I was just seconded.    So I kept my position at Transnet and I was just seconded to Eskom.    yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no sorry Chair.  Yes it lasted until September.    Sorry, sorry it does not make it five years it makes it four years and maybe nine months.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes in fact my salary into my bank account was paid by Transnet.    And Transnet was reimbursed by Eskom.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.  That is an Honorary Doctorate.    No I do not have any other Honorary Doctorates.    No I cannot say that with certainty Chair.  The fact that you are qualified does not make you a corruption detective.    A – a detector of corruption.    A corruption detection machine.    No I did not say that.    No, I did not say so Chair.  I did not express an opinion.    I just say that I was definitely not a corruption detection machine and that does not mean that if I saw corruption I could not see – I could not understand it or I was incapable of understanding and so it is not a – you are able or unable.    So I am just saying that I am not a specialist corruption detection machine.    As you might be.    Yes there were incidents where there was issues of discipline, maybe corruption.  It is just that now that you ask me.  But I do remember once or twice there was an issue relating to somebody who was security personnel at TFR that had been involved in issues of discipline maybe you could even say it was corruption but that we dealt with and several incidents.  It is just that they were not a subject of this commission.    I never went back to – to refresh my memory but there were issues discipline that we dealt with while I was there.    The?    Yes.    Come again.    No I do not know that.    Yes I am not sure of the ownership structure of the New Age.    I do not know about it.    Yes Chair.    No I did not know anything about this.    Interestingly Chair when I went to check I was in fact oversees in New York at the time when this published and by the – by the date of this newspaper article I had actually been there for a few days maybe over a week.  It was at the tail end of my trip to – to the United States.    Yes.    I was overseas and I think I got a message on my phone that said,  do you know anything about the – you going to be appointed at Transnet CEO?  And that was my response.  I have not been informed, I do not know anything about it.     I think it came from …    Journalist.    Perhaps one of these journalists.      But I just remember just seeing a message that says that the – do you know that you are just – you are going to be appointed CEO of Transnet?  And I said no I do not know anything about and I have not been informed by anyone.    No I did not reflect carefully about it.    No I did not.  I – Chairperson even now I get all sorts of questions about – from the media about the – all sorts of incidents that I do now know anything about and my answer is very short I do not know, I cannot comment.    There has been lots of incidents if you go through the media where I had no comment to make because in fact the media was wrong and there was nothing like that.    No I did not.    Why – why is it difficult for you to 00   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No I did not think about it – I did not…    I did not stress – I did not stress about it.    Come again.    No I did not Chair.  I – actually I had surely even forgotten about the article because it is something that happened; I was literally in New York and I got to hear that they say that I am going to be appointed Transnet CEO; I did not know anything about it.  Nobody had said anything to me about it and I did not know anything about it and I dismissed it.  And – and then later on I – I did not link the article to my appointment.    I was in fact at the time of the article in the – I was called up to the SANDF at the time of that.    It is a – I am a reserve so I cannot say I was unemployed.    But I was called up as a reserve and at the same time I had been doing some transactions with Investec Bank which is what I was doing (inaudible).    Maybe six months.    Yes.    Unemployed I was not looking for a job.    Ja so that is a definition of unemployment.    When you looking for a job.    And you not doing – I was not looking for job.    There are some transactions that I had been doing.    With the Investec Bank.    And at the on – at this particular time I was in fact on callout at the SANDF.    So this was maybe about two or three weeks     No it is a…    It is reserves yes.    Ja.    I was not employed by anyone.    Ja.     In a sense because – because I – yes I was not employed by anyone.    Yes.    No I did not know that.    I came to know about it in the context of getting these documents but not until now did I know and I now I mean when do you have….    When the bundle was made available yes.    Yes.  I do not know what this happened.     My recollection is that Mr Khumalo, Brian - I think it was Brian Khumalo – called me could sometime, I think, in January and ...[intervenes]      2011.     Yes.     Called me and said that Transnet has been looking for a Group Chief Executive and they have appointed him as the head-hunter.  Mr Brian Khumalo was the head-hunter. In fact, he tried to head hunt ...[intervenes]      I think he ...[intervenes]      Yes.     So he called me and said    Yes.     Yes.     No.     Yes, recently.  Yes.     Yes, I have seen it in the documents.       No.  No, I have not seen that.     Of Transnet?     I was not aware of that, no.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I do not know anything about that and in addition to that, I do not know Mr Essa.  I have never met Mr Essa.     I did not even know who he was.     Come again?     No.     I did not meet Mr Essa.       So I did not know Mr Essa.  That is all I am saying.     I do not know what the Gupta’s needed to do or did not need to do.     Where?  Transnet?     I have testified that I knew them.     ...Mr Essa was deployed to do or not deployed to do but I did not know Mr Essa.       Well ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.       Yes, but all I am saying Chair is that he says that the Gupta’s never sent Essa to meet with me.  There is no way that I can know that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.  They ...[intervenes]      Ja, there was a need to talk to me, they could have spoken to me because I knew them.     Perhaps.     Yes.  Perhaps a coincidence.      I really cannot comment on it.  I do not know if it was a coincidence.  I do not know what it was.     But it is something that I am not aware.  I am not...  I cannot comment on it.     I cannot.     By Mr Bester?     Of Eskom?     I do not know.  Perhaps when Mr Bester came here.     When Mr Bester came here, yes.  Or when I got the documents.  I am not sure.  The Eskom documents.       No, I did not ...[intervenes]      I did not – I was not surprised.     Nor was I moved at all.     It was just something that he said there that I did not think anything about.  I just thought, you know, these people talk about you all the time.  I did not – I was not shocked or surprised.     I have people talking about me all the time.     I have journalists and newspapers saying things that are pitifully wrong.  That I do not take to head anymore.      So when I do hear rumours about myself, I – they just do not enter my existence.       I am sorry to ...[intervenes]      I am ...[intervenes]      I am sorry to disappoint you then.     But ...[intervenes]      But your expectation for me to be surprised does not materialise.     But I do not know who Mr Essa is.     Yes, now I do.     Would you rather that it was of concern to me?     I answered the question.  I said it was not.     Yes, Chair but ...[intervenes]      Chairperson ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chairperson.     Chairperson, can I explain this?       Firstly, Mr Bester heard from somebody.     Mr Bester heard from somebody.  He says he was told by somebody that I would become CEO of Eskom ...[intervenes]      ...I am saying it is Mr Salim.     Yes.     Yes, he was told by somebody there where they were in a restaurant in one evening.  His... partner... Mr Essa.  It happened to Mr Essa, told him that I would become CEO of Eskom.  Number one.  So he heard it from somebody.  He does not have personal knowledge of it.  Number one.       No, no.  They...  But we do not know that.  Mr Essa ...[intervenes]      No.  Chairperson, please allow me to finish.     Where you are coming from?     Yes.  Yes, but I am trying to tell you where I am coming from.     Secondly.  The person that Mr Bester is talking about ...[intervenes]      So the first one is, it was hearsay.  Mr Bester heard it from somebody that he was having dinner with.     It was hearsay.  He heard it – it was gossip, it was hearsay.  He heard it there while they were having dinner in my absence.  Secondly.  The person that he is talking about I have never met.  I have never met him.  I, actually, do not know him.  Why would something that was said by somebody that I do not know worry me?  Why would it worry me?   And the fact that it eventually happened.  I know how it happened.  I know that I was approached by the Minster, not Mr Essa.  I do not know if the Minister has a link with Mr Essa but I know it actually eventually happened.   And in my knowledge of how it happened, there is no discussion with Bester and Essa.  There is no – they do not feature anywhere.  That is something – that is like a random event that happened there which this Commission is now trying to elevate to an event of significance.   But in my head, it was between Mr Bester...  I, actually, do not even – I am not even an acquaintance of Mr Bester.  I just know him from his – that he was a manager there at the Eskom.   So Mr Bester who is not even acquitted with me, has a discussion with somebody that I do not know.  And that is suppose to worry me?  No, it does not.  It is something that happened there that I do not know anything about.   I know how I got to be appointed at Eskom.  I can account about how I got to be appointed to Eskom and it has got nothing to do with people that I do not know.  That is why it does not worry me.       Yes.     Chairperson, I just want to...  There is a guy who dished up a salad for me.  I do not know that guy.  He might actually, as I was walking in, have said to the guy     This was not one of them.     Yes.     But ...[intervenes]      Maybe Chairperson, unlike you and Mr Myburgh I am not a good conspiracy theorist.       So Chairperson, if it was you, you would have been worried?       And then what?       I am afraid, if you were in my position you would have been investigating every day.  You would have spend your life just pursuing rabbit holes.       That are going nowhere.     Yes.     Yes.     What is your assumption?     No ...[intervenes]      No, you started your sentence by saying you assume.      Chairperson, Mr Bester never approached me with this hearsay evidence.     In the Commission?  Now recently?     There was no reason to be concerned.  It was...  it happened in the past.  Perhaps maybe if Mr Bester had come to me and said to me I heard from Mr Essa that you are going to be the next CEO, maybe I would have been concerned.       But it comes out in the context of the Commission.  The it is hearsay.  And I expect that the Commission will test the veracity but that is not my job.  Where I am now, what Mr Bester was saying he heard a few years ago, is not something that concerned me.       [No audible reply]      Well, if you say Mr Essa was engaged in corrupt in activity using my name, is that what you are found?     No.     Yes.     But I do not know that person.     No, it will concern me if I was also involved in some kind of activity that is corrupt and so on and so forth.  Maybe I would have been concerned.  But when I knew that this person was just – people do this all the time.   Chairperson, I can give you an example.  People will say to somebody, and it has happened to me, I know Mr Molefe and I can arrange a meeting with you but you must pay me twenty thousand.  And the person pays twenty thousand.       Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, Chairperson what if you do not know that person but it is alleged was advancing criminality?  You do not know them.  You have never met them.  And there are allegations that they are advancing criminality and they are just allegations.   And my attitude, Chair, would be that you will spend your life...  People do all sorts of things.  You will spend your life running down rabbit holes which is what I have tried to avoid my life.  Just chasing and chasing and chasing rabbit holes.  Rabbit holes that have no meaning.   There is a great example, Chairperson, of a farmer who was trying to – who was having a problem with a rabbit that was eating the farmer ’s – his vegetable garden, vegetable patch.  And he saw the rabbit going to the barn and he shot at the rabbit but the barn caught fire.  The people came to put out the fire.  And the deep question remained but what happened to the rabbit.       As long as I do not know the person who it is alleged is using my name.  Is alleged is using my name.  Then, Chairperson, I had all sorts of other things to do.       Well, to go to the police you would have to have evidence of wrongdoing.     And once you have the evidence of wrongdoing but it is indeed so and that they are incorrect corrupt, that there is evidence that crimes were committed then you are obliged to report to the police but as long as you meet somebody who says that so and so steals cars and he was talking about it and you do not even have evidence that that person stole a car, I mean, what are you going to say when you get to the police?  [speaking vernacular] he is talking about me and you do not even know that person.     Yes, you and I do, Mr Myburgh.     I disagree with you.     Yes, I was surprised.     And who?     Who had a meeting with Singh?     Essa that met with me?     Yes.     At that meeting?     I would have been surprised that Mr Singh had met Mr Essa?     Is that what you are saying?     It had nothing to do with me.     You see, Mr Myburgh, I think you know Mr Essa to be corrupt and that Mr Bester ’s gospel truth about things that Essa said and what the people that he talked about and the meetings that we had, now with hindsight surprise you, that – sorry, now with hindsight shock you and your find revolting because we are here today and you now know what you know but I did not know about the corrupt activities and when people say that – when Mr Mcebisi Jonas said that one of the Gupta brothers said they will work with Brian Molefe, he does not even remember who it was that said so.  I know it not to be true that I worked with them in the manner that he was suggesting and I do not understand why it should worry me in Setswana they say [speaking vernacular], the guilty conscience convicts itself, I do not [speaking African language] in English.  So the guilty conscience is the one that – so if you do not have a guilty conscience …[intervenes]     Yes.     Ja, ukwahlulela(?) is to give judgment, ukwahlulela is to judge yourself.       Yes.     Yes, yes.     Ja, ja.     You know.     And a guilty conscience may force you to act in a particular way.     Because you know that this is – there is substance.     So because I did not have that conscience that said that when Mr Essa’s name is mentioned I must jump and investigate.  I did not do it, I did not see a need to do it because my conscience did not demand of me to do anything.     It means [speaking vernacular].     No.     Mr Myburgh, are you saying that I knew?     No, I am telling you I did not.     Not.     Mr Myburgh, I think that you would like to see a particular outcome and I am sorry if I disappoint you.     Yes.     Yes. ADV     So you will try to determine whether I knew?     Yes.     Yes.  If I know it to be true…     Definitely.     Then my reaction might be different.     If I cannot ascertain whether it is true or not, I do not know if I will invest my time to pursuing it if maybe it is fifty/fifty.     Or maybe if it is unlikely or like I say but people that I do not know at the dinner table.  So if I know it to be definitely true then maybe my reaction might be different but if it is something that is just a spurious allegation then I would not pursue it.  I mean, there have been suggestions that I was going to be the next CEO of SAA.  I have never gone and investigated who said it, why they said it and  - like I say, it is a rabbit hole that you end up pursuing to no end, wasting time and resources.     Ja, Chairperson, if that question is very important to you and it needs to be investigated, right, and the question is when they say that they heard it from good authority, who was the good authority?  I think that is what should interest me.  I am telling you that I did not know anything about it, I was definitely not the good authority that they were talking about  The source of that story was, as they say, good authority.  So who was it?   Perhaps the Commission should have investigated, perhaps you should have asked the journalist, call the journalist here and say when you said you heard it from good authority, who was the good authority?  Did Brian Molefe know about it?  What did he say when you confronted him with the question?   Because what I said when Io was confronted with the question was actually fortunately published, I do not know about it, nobody talked to me about it, I do not know anything about it.     Because, Chairperson, I think that now it appears to me that just because the Commission did not investigate who the good authority was, it looks like you want to keep it on me and say that Molefe, you knew about this and you were part of it and so on and so on when in fact the correct thing to have done was to ask this journalist where did you get and how come that you were so accurate?   I cannot answer those questions.     Yes.     I am telling you that I did not know.     And for that I am being ridiculed.     Okay.     So, Chairperson, you are saying that this line of questioning is part of the investigation of who the source was?     Yes.  And, Chairperson, I can assure you that I have promised that I will cooperate with the Commission, I will tell you what I knew.     And then where I did not know anything I will tell you that I did not know.     But let me say – I will go even further, Chair, I will actually desist from speculating as well.     Because I do not think that is fair.     Yes, yes.  Except …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I do not know, numerous times.     I do not – I cannot remember, Chair, because …[intervenes]     It was seven, eight, nine years ago.     No, seven, eight, nine years ago.     Like it happened, ja.  It depends, I mean, as I said, it was a live issue that we had reason to discuss which was the formation of the bank or the purchase of a bank and that we would discuss and we had tried to do it before I even went to Transnet and even after I had left to go to Transnet there would be occasion to talk about maybe a development or a – talk about a possibility or a – whatever needed to be discussed along those lines which conversations I assume are not part of the [indistinct – dropping voice]     Ja, maybe two.  Not the relationships …[intervenes]     Knowing them.     Ja, knowing them, talking about them, knowing them.     And then when I tried to do this bank and I went to them to ask them if there would be a way that they could assist me.     And that is when you can say on this stuff I had left the [indistinct – dropping voice]     PIC, that came down in that context.     I do not know, Chair, because you cannot talk of an average month.  Maybe in one month I would go three times and then do not go for six months and then maybe go once, maybe – it was sporadic.     It is difficult to …[intervenes]     To attach – it is difficult to attach an average to it.       I do not know, maybe once a month on average.     Over a six months period – over a 12 month period.        Over a – no, I do not know …[intervenes]     Because it is not linear as well, so…     It is not linear, so you cannot take – if I say that I went there two times every six months you cannot say over a five year period I went two times, six months, ja.     But, Mr Myburgh, I do not know how you arrived these conclusions that you are now putting into the record as if they are evidence.     Ja, I understand mathematics is a complex subject maybe for you, Mr Myburgh, but I also said you cannot impute a linear relationship.     Which means that you cannot therefore draw a graph.     If you drew the graph you would arrive at a conclusion that I was there last month.     Yes.     Yes but who is witness 1?     Yes, it may well be true.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     But then, you see, the thing about linearity is that maybe during that period it was 11 times over a 14 month period, maybe in the next 14 months I went there twice of thrice.     That was witness 3.     It was not witness 2, it was witness 3, witness 2 never mentioned my name.     Yes, yes.     They would have the one – and, I do not know, whenever they had occasion.  They would invite me, sometimes I would go, sometimes I would not go.       Yes, yes.     To talk about the bank, to talk about developments in the banking sector.     To talk about the bank, to talk about developments in the banking sector, to talk about developments with period the person that had agreed to help us establish the bank.  To talk about different things.     Mainly relating to the fact that we had been trying to establish a bank.     Well, a meeting is when two people come together, whether it is on friendly terms or on hostile terms, a meeting is a meeting, as in meet, so…     So I was not really going into different classifications of meetings in terms of the literature.     I remember that that is what the Public Protector said.     That is what the Public Protector said.     Chairperson, if you go into my affidavit…     You will see that I deal with that specific issue.     I went several times but then on the Public Protector ’s report I engaged a communication specialist who I gave authority to go and get my telephone report and he says in his report that the Public Protector ’s report was wrong because in one instance, I – it is in my evidence, I went …[intervenes]     It is attached to my affidavit.     I am sorry, it is attached to my Eskom affidavit.     Yes, but if you go and check my Eskom affidavit.     I deal with that in the report of the telecommunication specialist.     He says in one instance in twenty minutes I made, I think, three calls and received about – I made two calls or – and received nine calls and the Public Protector counted that in 20 minutes, in 20 minutes in the Saxonwold area, and the Public Protector counted that as 11 different visits to the Saxonwold area, and the specialist, it is in the – perhaps that is why the Eskom stream never asked me about the Public Protectors report because it is actually arose when I was at Eskom.   And perhaps because they saw that I - my only, the only reason I could fathom for them not being interested in the Public Protectors report was that I actually explained quite well, the flaws in the Public Protectors report and…[intervene]     Maybe, Mr Myburgh it would help if you went and read my response in the Eskom stream to the Public Protectors report and the affidavit, and the specialist pointed out…[intervene]     Yes, and a specialist pointed out that that report of the Public Protector relating to my telephone was erroneous.      It had errors.     I do not know; it is difficult to say.     But I do not think that here was a discernible change in pattern when I went to Eskom.     There was a, yeah.     Where did you see that?     Yes, yes, I do not deny that I did go to the residents even when I was at Eskom. And how often…[intervene]     I can recall that there was a change in taken or attitude.      Ja, that did happen.     No, no.      They did come to my house once, several times.     No, I hardly ever had functions at my house but when I do have, for example, occasion to cook a dinner I would maybe once in a while, invite them over for dinner.     I do not know Chairperson, because part of the problem, because I was not keeping a tab but part of the problem was that according to the telephone specialist, the Public Protectors report counted incidents where the phone was not answered, and where messages were left.      I did not keep a tab I do not know how…[intervene]     No but…[intervene]     But Mr Myburgh…[intervene]     Mr Myburgh it is not necessary to patronise me, please do not patronise me.     But Chairperson, I take exception to being patronised by Mr Myburgh saying that I am an intelligent person and so on, and so that is patronising.      When I get a chance to respond, I must tell him that he is patronising.     Yes.      It is dependent on the issues at the particular point in time.  He would call or I would call if I had something that crossed my mind about a particular issue, and I cannot remember how often we spoke, but we did speak.     And I actually hardly ever spoke to the other two brothers.  It was just really Mr Ajay that had been interested in the bank, because the Public Projector also refers to a telephone call from Mr Atul Gupta and when we checked my phone records, we found that Mr Atul Gupta did call, the call was never answered and I never returned the call and the Public Protector counted it as a phone call from Mr Atul Gupta to me.     Mr who?     No, I do not recall the evidence of Mr Jonas, who is Mr Jonas?     Mr Jones?      Oh Jonas.      Oh Jonas, I thought you said…[intervene]     Oh, Mr Jonas, Jonas.     Chairperson, I cannot comment on Mr Jonas's evidence.  I mean, I was not there. He says somebody who he cannot say for sure, it was said all of those things and I said I could not comment on it.  But what I could comment on was my career and when you did put it to me, I said to you that I do not think that my career requires assistance from a person that Mr Jonas had had met on the corridors.     Yes.     You reflected on that?     But I cannot comment on your reflection.     I do not know Chairperson; no I do not know that the Gupta’s needed me.     This passage, from Mr Jonas the story that he was told by somebody in a corridor.  A person who – he does not really recall…[intervene]     I seem to recall that somebody was passing in that corridor, and they said, Mr…[intervene]     And in fact, he does not even recall even with your version Chairperson, he says it might have been.     So this statement that was mentioned by one of the Gupta brothers to Mr Jonas was it done in that meeting?     Did Mr Hlongwane or Mr Duduzane Zuma get to hear this person talking like this?     So both of them denied.     But Chairperson, I fail to understand how the Commission continues to attach such value to the statement by Mr Jonas, that has not been corroborated by people who were present.     Yes.     Yes.     But Chairperson you see that statement, as is put by Mr Jonas, that is not corroborated.  If it were true, it would advance a particular narrative that will excite Mr Myburgh.   So to the extent that it looks like I mean, I have had it repeated even in my absence here in the Commission, during the evidence of others that he has said, but Mr Jonas say, but Mr Jonas say even now and the feeling that I have is that that statement of Mr Jonas that was said by this person, it has not been corroborated.  That was in any event, hearsay evidence.  It looks like the Commission attaches a lot of weight to it just like Mr Besters statement that, I doubt - I do not know maybe it has been corroborated.  But while we were at the dinner it is indeed true that Mr Salim Essa did mention this.  So there I do not know if there were any attempts to corroborate this evidence that I am now being confronted with, that I now have to respond to, on the basis of which I am now being ridiculed.     Yes.     But I have said that Mr Myburgh is repeating it again.     But when Mr Jonas says it, it is accepted immediately.     Yes, well all I was suggesting Chairperson, was that perhaps, if we want to check if that is true.  We should ask the people who were present to corroborate what Mr Jonas was saying.  And if they cannot corroborate it, or if no attempt has been made to corroborate from the people who were present, it is really unfair to be asking me who was not present, what if I think that is true.     Yes, sir.     Yes.     No, Chairperson just for the record.  Also, I cannot answer what happened that day with Mr Jonas.      I cannot remember making that conscious decision but maybe there was a time when I was less I frequented the place.     No, no, I suppose Chairperson, I cannot say that I had decided not to go there because I was I was afraid of the accusations and so on and so forth.  But yeah, there was a time when I was not going to their residence anymore.      I do not know Chairperson; I think we just drifted apart.      We just drifted apart.     Yes, I did after the Public Protectors report, I think I did.      No, the Public Protectors report said, Mr Molefe’s telephone record says in the Saxonwold area, not that the Gupta’s residence.     If actually the Public Protector had interviewed me and allowed me the opportunity to ask as the Act demand question about the evidence that she had, I would have asked her when you say I was in the Saxonwold area, what technology did you use, how did you really do it?  Because she does not really say how the telephone records was done.  But when I was going to eat at the time, I said that, on that morning, I think we were giving on financial, I walked into the Eskom Executive Committee and I sat there with the whole executive committee.  I actually kept quiet for a few seconds and then I said, the Public Protector says I was in the Saxonwold area. And that means that I was at the Gupta residence can somebody balance me if I was in the Saxonwold area my telephone records say I was in the Saxonwold area, does that mean that I was at the Gupta residence?  I was not saying I was there, or I was not there, I was just saying the veracity of the Public Protectors claim that I was at the Gupta residence  And then one member of the executive, Mr Chaustery[?] and I said it over and over again.  Mr Chaustery[?] says that is ridiculous because actually in that area there is a shebeen and if yet she had asked me, she would have seen that I always go to a shebeen.   So, I said Chaustery[?], really and he said yes and then later on in afternoon, when I was talking about during the results announcement I said, you know, Chaustery[?] here, says there is a shebeen there, he says there and that if they had asked him they would have found that, in fact, there is shebeen there.  I was saying what Chaustery[?] had said in the morning.  And then, I then also said so using this logic the Public Protector if she had looked at my phone record, she would have found that every day, I pass on the N1 in Midrand to go home.  In the morning and in the afternoon and I am less than one and a half kilometres away from a place called Kisa[?] in Midrand. She might as well have come to the conclusion that every day from Monday to Friday in the morning and in the evening, I go to Kisa[?], but that would have been wrong, her logic is wrong.  So I did not say that there was a shebeen in fact, the Sunday Times did publish an article that says that Mr Molefe said he was at the shebeen and I challenged it with the person, that was what I did and he said after listening carefully, what Mr Molefe had said he never said he was at a shebeen.  And yet, despite all of that, the media went on and on about the shebeen.  Chairperson, I also said in that at Eskom there was a man in Cape Town, just forget his name, who had been found to have tampered with his meter. electricity grid.     With his electricity meter, you know the meter that measures how much electricity.     So they tampered with it so that it does not register the unit.  So the Eskom officials went to his house and found that the meter had been tampered with, and then he admitted to it, they found him guilty, they fined him I think R10 000,00 he paid it.  And a few months later, they came to his house to check his meter again and they found that it had been tampered with and on the spot they disconnected his electricity and fined him again and refused to reconnect him until he had paid his fine, which was I think, was double what the fine has been.  And then…[intervene]     And then the person went to the Public Protector to complain, to complain that he has been disconnected from the grid.     You will hear it when I get to that.     No, Chairperson I have been waiting five and a half years to tell this story.     Yes, but okay but then the Public Protector found that the fact that this guy had been found to have been tampering with his meter before, does not mean that he had now been tampering with the meter and that Eskom should have had a process to determine whether or not he had been tampering with it. And she said, some prophetic words, in that finding, she says, the fact that a person is known to be a goat thief, it does not mean that when you see him next to a head of goats, that he has stolen the goats.  The fact that a known goat thief is walking next to sheep to the goats, does not mean that he has stolen the goats.  And I said, even at that time in 2016, that it is strange, then, that if the Public Protector places me in Saxonwold next to the proverbial head of sheep, or goats, it means that I was doing something wrong.  So that is the relevance of the story that the Public Protector herself had come to a conclusion without due process, something that she had found us guilty of doing as Eskom in the past.     Yes.     No, Chairperson, what I knew at the time, was that Glencoe had been to her and that we were having a colossal fight, and that she had chosen to listen to and that this marathon had been created by Glencoe and battled in the media.  As I said, when I was giving evidence in Eskom you would be surprised what R1billion can achieve and for them, R1billion could buy.     Yes.     But Chairperson, what I did know is that nobody had proven any impropriety.     And that was the whole point of the whole thing to suggest that there had been impropriety.  That is why I talk about the story of the man walking next to the sheep, it does not mean he has stolen them. So to suggest impropriety you had to do much more than what the Public Protector did. She basically Chairperson pulled my name over the coals and caused my name to be tarnished without a proper investigation.    They can go on until midnight.    Yes, yes I cannot – I cannot put a date.  Ja I suppose by the time I left Eskom or after I had left Eskom I    I do not know Chair that they played me; maybe they I do not know but what I – what I do feel – what I definitely feel is that there have been suggestions that I have – I did things that are wrong and there has not been evidence to show exactly what it is that I did wrong.   I have no regrets that I knew the Gupta’s.  I have no regrets that I had gone to their house; that I had spoken to them over the phone.  I was not the only South African that did that.  However I also feel that for anyone suggests that I was involved in wrongdoing they have to come with proper evidence and that has not been forthcoming. What has been forthcoming is this – is this – this narrative as I put it but you were walking too close to she.  The proverbial votes.    No I feel that I was done in by the Public Protector – the Public Protector..    No the person who was supposed to protect me from this onslaught that happened because of evidence or in the absence of evidence the person that was supposed to protect me was the Public Protector.      The – the Gupta’s I do not know they may have done what they did but I was not part of it so I do not …    Yes.    Chairperson the thing that makes me feel betrayed is I feel like somebody walked into the Gupta residence and they had (inaudible) maybe – maybe let us say it was the police or the Hawks or whatever and then all they did was to open fire and kill everything that was moving there including myself.  When they did not ask why are you here, what are you doing here and this is what you doing and this is what is wrong about your being here.    So I feel like – I feel like the Public Protector just went in there and just opened fire.    Putting a machine gun on rapid fire and shot at everything that was moving.    But…    Well – you and I are wired differently.      But Chairperson if I am found with somebody who stole a car for example.    Oh sorry, sorry.    That is why I say Mr Myburgh I think we are wired differently.    There was…    Mr Myburgh says.    Ja so let us – that is why I say you and I are wired differently.  The way that I think about that question is let us assume that I am walking down the street with somebody who stole a car and then the police come and without asking any questions arrest both of us and go and torture both of us without asking me or trying to establish even from the person that I am arrested with.    My culpability and then put me through porter, prison whatever maybe even succeed in getting me sentenced to prison who do you become angry with? The guy that you are walking in the street or is it the police who did not do their job?  And that is why I say that the person who betrayed me is the Public Protector because she should have known as she said in the case of the guy in Cape Town that you need proper investigation before you drag somebody’s name into the arena where you are fighting for (inaudible).    I feel betrayed by the Public Protector.    Yes.    By the way we are still going to give evidence about the stealing of the money.    Oh ja well if…    Eventually.  Eventually there is proof beyond reasonable doubt or if – even on the basis of the commission if there is findings that there was indeed laundering then I will feel betrayed.  The constitution Chair says people must be – must have until proven guilty.  The way that we are approaching this whole problem of the Gupta’s is that guilt has already been ascribed before there has been proper processing.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    And Chairperson I said – I said one day in Parliament when I asked a similar question about the Gupta’s I said you know you may be ascribing guilt to them and you say they did wrong things and so on and you may well be right but until there has been proper processing – proper processes of – of ascertaining their guilt then I mean it is like seeing somebody kills somebody and this person that killed somebody we know who this person is…    And you saying – you are asking me do you think – do you think.    Do you think that the murderer betrayed you when the guy who committed the murder or alleged who committed the murder has not been convicted of murder.  There may well be evidence that they did things that are wrong but Chairperson let me – or let me – to answer Mr Myburgh’s question correctly then.  The day that you make your finding and the day that they have been arrested and being put in prison and have been found guilty in terms of – of the laws of our land perhaps at that point I will feel betrayed but at the moment I really take the constitutional principle of not guilty until found guilty very seriously.  I said this to Parliament once that really I suspect the thing that has captured me is our constitution.  With our constitution that even the Gupta’s have rights in terms of our constitution and that was the spirit of our constitution because what Parliament was saying was that you know these people have done this – they have done this and so on and so forth.  Now there are allegations that they stole money and so on and so on it may well be true but let us wait for the right legal processes to unfold.  Perhaps at that point Mr Myburgh you can ask me.    Do you feel betrayed and I will say now I really feel betrayed but for now I cannot be sitting here and agreeing with you that they are guilty because like me they have not been put through a proper legal process by a – a forum that is recognised by our law and our constitution.    Yes and that their assets were attached and subsequently returned because I do not know what the Judge found.    After their assets were attached then after a proper legal process they were returned.  So I would rather wait for the courts in – in – where…    It is a very interesting constitutional question Chair.    Of whether – of a person who is not guilty until proven guilty if that person flees does that suddenly mean that you can treat them as being guilty?    Yes.    Ja.  But the fact that they do not want to    As the GCE of Transnet yes.    Perhaps I – perhaps I should not have gone to Eskom at the time when I was asked to go to Eskom.  Perhaps I was too disciplined and to agree to go to Eskom.  Because Chairperson I really believed in the market    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  So that is my regret that perhaps I should have stayed.    Yes.    Which Dr Molefe?    No because my father is also Dr Molefe.    And sometimes also …    Ja and people also refer me to Dr Molefe but I frown on it because it is just an honorary doctorate.    He says he has explained what?    I do not know what he is talking about.    The changes in the PPM?    Which changes in particular?    Yes.  Yes I think that if I – sometimes I feel that if I had stayed there longer we would have continued the successes that we were experiencing on the – one the operational side of the business.    No but I am.    Ja I am saying that the – the successes that we achieved on the operational side that – that those successes are the things that positively contributes to...    Economic growth.    The operational side is the side that contributes to growth in the economy.   Transnet was not from an operational point of view what it used to be when I arrived there by the time I left.    And that – that would have been seen in the credentials.    Thanks.     Yes.     Yes, the majority.  Yes...     [No audible reply]      I cannot remember exactly when it was announced but, yes, it was after I had...     Yes.     It was the most important thing.  A number one.     It was exciting to be in charge of an organisation that had a plan.       Yes, sir ...[intervenes]      Well, the 70% of the MDS was to be funded from operations and 30% from borrowings but the 70% from operations over the seven year period included from improved operations.  So what was really stressful about it was that if the operations do not improve during the seven year period and we do not realise those funds from operations, then the MDS would also collapse because...  So it really – it had funds that were based on what we were going to achieve ...[intervenes]      Yes, so the – our performance was a function of the availability of the funds but also the markets would not give us the money, the 30% borrowings if we fail in the first couple of years.     When I joined Transnet they had a BADC and this was not unusual for a board to have an oversight of procurement.  Actually, now that you mention it, I cannot remember that Transnet had a history of not having a BADC.  It never occurred to me that this was new and that it never existed before.  But when I – certainly when I joined, there was a BADC that had – that oversaw procurement activities.       When in 2011?     So that must have been in January.     I joined in, I think, in February.     ...BADC...     Yes.     Yes.     Chair ...[intervenes]      I saw that but according to the evidence that you have.  Who increased the BADC’s authority?     I cannot specifically recall that Chair.     But, you see, it depends on who increased it.  So if it was the board and if it is true that the BADC’s authority was increased by the board, then the board had authority to do so.     Yes.     Yes.     No, that is no true.     I disagree with that wholly.     Because there is nothing that I did at Transnet, even at Eskom, that had not been recommended.     That had not been recommended.     From lower down.     So the instances where I actually wrote a memo to approve something myself – I wrote the memo and then I approved it myself – are very – I cannot actually even recall one.   But everything was originated in the operating units and they wrote their recommendation that they wanted and the executives had to recommend it and only then would I approve.  Sometimes not approve it.   But also, we had a well-functioning Executive Committee and that some – the matter – a lot of the matters were referred to the Executive Committee for – they were approved...     Yes.  Although there was a power to award tenders on a confinement basis, as I say, I would rarely do it without a recommendation.     Yes.     Mister who?     Foreminck?     Yes. ADV MYBURGH     Yes.     Yes.     Mr Foreminck is a peace time hero because he never raised that issue with me when I was there.     Yes, yes.     But before we proceed.  Let me help you also with context.  The other context about procurement at the Transnet was that in the process of procurement every step there was assurance that was given by assurance teams.       Assurance.     That was given.     By assurance teams.     For example, they have things that they call gate(?), for example, in the...  So there would be the initial sort of process and then assurance must be given and then assurance will open the gate to the next phase and the next phase of the next phase.  So you could not get to from identifying a project to – of procurement and get to the final payment without assurance.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     There was a ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.  In fact, those things we called me gates.     That could be only opened by legal ...[intervenes]      ...and internal audit.     And sometimes external assurance.     But everything so far was right.     And that was – for me that was the most important thing.     For example, when you are having – when you have a tender.     So when the bid was submitted, before you open them, the assurance people come.  Then you open it, then you adjudicate it each time they open the gate.     Yes?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, but when the – when the tender was issued, the main consortium, there must have been a memo that was ...[intervenes]      You have it there by you.     No, I just wanted to see it for my ...[intervenes]      Alright.     Yes.     Yes?     Yes.  So it was awarded properly. ADV MYBURGH     Yes, okay?     Yes.     Yes, I remember there was an issue about the conflict of interest.     ...involving...     Exhibit 22?     What is the page number?     Yes, it was compiled by Mr Josef Mohamed, recommended by Gary Peter and Anoj Singh.     I approved it.     Ja, Chairperson, as you said, these documents were received last night, but if I recall the problem was that Barloworld was a potential bidder.     Barloworld was a potential bidder.     If I recall from what I said now.  And that Letsema was in partnership with Barloworld.     And for Letsema to be advising on the bid evaluations, because this is what I think this was about, there would be a conflict.     As far as I recall the incident, I think that is what happened.     But if you read the memo it should say what the problem was.     But what I recall was that ...[intervenes]      What I recall was that Barloworld was a...  Ja, I...  I do not know...  Maybe, Chairperson, I am making a mistake but the conflict that I remember was that Barloworld was a potential bidder or a potential partner as one of the bidders.     Chair, I would have to go through these documents properly.  As I say ...[intervenes]      ...we – they were handed out last night.     Yes, yes.  Please, I would like to go through ...[intervenes]      ...through it.  But sitting here, what I remember was that Barloworld would be a potential bidder and so Letsema advising on the transaction advisory would have been a conflict ...[intervenes]      That is what I ...[intervenes]      Ys.     Yes.     Yes, that is what the memo says.     It is not in the bundle?     22 August, which years?     2012.     Yes.     On the 12 t h of December?     6 t h of December.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes?     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Yes?     338?     358.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, but Chairperson, as I always said at Transnet, before something like this happened, Mr Singh enters into an agreement.     Before something like this happens, Mr Singh ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      This agreement.     ...before something like this gets signed.       There is usually a memo ...[intervenes]      A memo.     That I have always said to Transnet Executives which must be written in English so that everybody understands as to why we are doing what we are doing.     That is recommended by somebody and then approved before we actually do the action, this is the action.  So I will be curious to see if there was a memo preceding …[intervenes]     Ja, I will be curious to see if there was a memo preceding. ADV     Yes.     Oh, I see.     But was there no memo?     Because even with that, I suspect there would have been something that says that look, there was a memo before that say McKinsey must replace Letsema and McKinsey has suggest that Letsema should be replaced and so and so and therefore the contract is ready to be signed, we recommend that it be signed.     No, I just saw that Mr Ian Sinton gave evidence but I never looked at his affidavit or …[intervenes]     This what Mr Sinton says?     Oh, this is what Mr Sinton says Mr Pillay told him?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Mr Sinton, Moodley …[intervenes]     Oh, Moodley…     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I do not.     So that was the arrangement between McKinsey and Regiments?     I cannot comment.     From Regiments?     Ja, I heard about Homix when the Gupta Leaks first came up.     I cannot comment.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Come again?  Annexures A and B?     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, this report was done by…?     Ja, it was done by the Commission.     Team.  Ja, you see, this is what I was referring to about findings.     This is one of them that has findings, at the beginning when I said …[intervenes]     Some of the reports have got findings.     Let us just say preliminary …[intervenes]     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.  No, I was just saying it so that there is a …[intervenes]     Even if you use other terminology.     Preliminary or…     Or conclusions or…     But when they say findings…     Because they work for the Commission.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Instead of saying analysed by the Commission, might be analysed by the money flows team.     Yes.     Yes.     The contract stated that Homix will be used.     Yes.     So the money from Transnet to Regiments to these companies?     Or was it from Transnet to McKinsey to Regiments?     Yes.     And then but they would pay their skills development partners.     After being paid by Transnet.     Yes.     Yes.     No, Chair.     This money laundering, I mean, it is not a finding, is it?     It is not a finding.     It is not a finding, so …[intervenes]    So the Chairperson must still apply his mind to this evidence.       On the face.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I agree with your choice of words, Chair.     It would seem so.       And so I will wait for the finding, the final finding to be made as to whether there was money laundering, there was corruption as he says and so on and so forth.  Then I will express my opinion at that point.  But the Commission is still ongoing, this is part of an investigation that is ongoing so let us wait and see what happens in – what comes out of the wash.     Yes.     It seems that that is what is going to happen.     So I will wait for the findings to be made and then we can take from you.     What I can categorically say now is I have no knowledge of these schemes.     And had no part in them.     And that from where I was sitting there was certainly no wrongdoing on my part.     It seems so.     But before one jumps, you must wait for the draft to beat first, the draft will beat when the findings are made.     Before you start dancing.     Yes.     Or I might even say …[intervenes]     Or I might even say well, it be interesting to hear what these people have to say about it.     Their right of reply.     Because when they do reply, a different picture might emerge.     So I would rather hold the horses and say I note what it being said, we will wait for the final outcome.     However, I do – I want to emphasise that in as far as my knowledge, my personal knowledge of these activities are concerned, I did not know about them and I was no involved and I deny any wrongdoing if that is what is …[intervenes]     What the drivers have to say?     What did the drivers say, Mr Myburgh.     Yes.     Ja, but on …[intervenes]     The Guptas …[intervenes]     It seems so.     No, I understand what you say and I also understand that you are saying it seems so.     No, the Chairperson said [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     All I said was I like the Chairperson’s choice of words.     Because we must still wait for the final finding.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  But let us wait for the final finding and in any case, you may well present this to me but it is up to the Chairperson …[intervenes]     To make a finding.     No, I will comment on it.     Ja, I mean you heard they did of their volition, for their own reasons, I did not see why I should...[intervenes]      Maybe they did it out of the goodness of their heart.     [laughing].  Yes, Mr Myburgh, Mr McKinsey took a particular line ...[intervenes]      ...of action and all I am saying is I do not see a need for me to comment.     To you, yes.     And to the Commission, yes.     Yes.     Even the famous case of the guy who slipped in the bathroom had a concussion…[intervene]     I say, is it not the case of the guy who slipped in the bathroom, had a concussion and then somebody rushed him to hospital and then on the way to hospital, they had a car accident, and then when they got to…[intervene]     I am saying to Mr Myburgh is this not the case of the guy who slipped in his bathroom, had a concussion, was rushed to hospital on the way to hospital, he had a car accident, and then when he got to hospital he was not attended to and he died. So now…[intervene]     Alright.     Yeah, and then what Mr Myburgh is saying, but the problem is the concussion.     But Mr Myburgh understands what I am trying to say.     Yes.     I have, I have not - I have no problem in you deciding that as long as it is based on evidence.      Yes.     Yes.      Yes, I see that.     No, the change that in which I was involved was to say that Regiments must find another partner.     No, that was not a big change.     The big change for me after everything that was said is when the deals that you are talk about were made.     Yeah, that was the big change.     Yeah, but just saying that Regiments must replace Letsema and just leaving it there.     I think was not a big change.      So it what on the actual, not even the replacement that happened, but the deals that you now described, happened down the line, where actually the big change happened.     Yes, but you must remember that my involvement was where not even the replacement.  It was to say that Letsema needs to be replaced because of the conflict of interest.  But it was unfortunate that here that conflict is not properly captured, because, as I remember, it was because Barloworld is likely to be a bidder.   But I will go and investigate this overnight about why Letsema was - there was a recommendation that I agreed with that Letsema must be replaced.  But the big change for me in listening to this story is when the deals that you are talking about, about sharing of the partners, and so on are concerned, that is where the bid is.     I did not know about that.     Yes, page?     What was that?     The green one that is mine.     Yes.      Ja, I have Chair.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chairperson, as you see, in 2.4.5 it     Then after that, what you presented was an agreement between McKinsey and partner by Mr Singh that that partner would be, and then I asked when that contract was presented here, that this contract must have been preceded by a name, I did ask at the time.   I do not know if you remember, I said the way that we did things for Mr Singh to sign a contract like this there must have been a memo that explains the background to this, to sign this contract.     And at the time, I said, I would be interested to see that memo, what that memo said about Regiments and what really the reasons behind this is, and then I think he said, no, we do not have the memo we just have the agreement.     No.     But at Transnet for Mr Singh to sign a contract like that, he needed a memo.      But that memo would say.     That is why I am curious to see if Mr Singh's signing of that contract was preceded by a memo written in what I always call at Transnet English, which explains why we are taking a decision.      You mean, why was that not recommended to me?     Yes, I was not saying who should replace Letsema, I was not involved.      So the letter will mean, where Letsema must be replaced.     I do, Chair      Which is why I am asking.      Mr Anoj Singh's signature of that contract was it preceded by name because that memo would have outlined the process that was followed or not followed.  It is actually in assessing the contents of that memo, if it exists. That would tell us exactly what happened and what the reasons were, yes. But unfortunately, because I did not sign that contract, I did not see that but what I am saying to the Commission, if you really, really want to get to the bottom of our arrangement or Mr Singh has got to sign that agreement. There must have been a memo unless Mr Singh comes here and says, no, I signed but there was no name.     Yes.      Yeah, no, I cannot think of any.      Chair.     The contract what I will do tonight is provide to the Commission and investigate if Mr Anoj Singh’s entering into a contract was ceded by a memo.  Let us find out if there was a memo and get hold of that memo.  Failing which perhaps it can be explained what the process was.     But we said I am not in a position to comment on that, because I also want to understand what the process was.     Unless if we find the memo that explains that.      The problem with your difficult questions, Mr Myburgh is that they are questions that did not involve anything that I did.     Because I can explain my actions.      No, no I said I was involved up to the point where Letsema had to be replaced.  I did not - I was not involved in the replacement of Letsema and all I am saying is in the replacement of Letsema was there memo that was written.     Was the definitely not, I mean, was Transnet asked for that memo?     No, no.     Ja, Chair that I am prepared to concede.      But maybe when we replaced, when we said Letsema must be replaced we should have also talked about a process to find the replacement.      We did not talk about the process.  However, I am curious to see even in the absence of stating that there must be a process, what was followed?  What was the process?      It would have been odd.     Yes.      I seem to recall that vaguely.     Ja, I recall - let me just say I remember.     Did Mr Singh sign the letter?     Vaguely Chair, I have no recollection of the detail.  But once again, there would have been a memo and I am quite happy to look at the memo, and look because that is what the discipline that we had instilled was that every action must be accompanied by a memo that explains in English, exactly what is happening.     Of the letter?     And the memo that precedes the letter if there is.      Or sorry, I had I put the file safely here on the chair, that I could not find.     No, that file that was missing…[intervene]      It was here on my chair, ja.     I put it away, but now I forgot it was there.      Yes.      What was the date of the letter?     Ja, but I can confirm that was not discussed with me.      I can confirm that that was not discussed with me.     Yes.      I cannot comment on that.     Hey?     But I cannot comment on it because as I say, I was not involved in it.      Ja, but…intervene]     Mr. Myburgh I said to you that the way that I understood the system to work was that every single decision has to be carefully explained in a memo.  Now in the absence of these memos, I mean, I do not know what the memos will say when we find them.     No, no the letter before you write a letter and make a decision like that or become involved in it there has to be a memo, that is how we operated and in the absence of a memo, I would really want to know why was it not properly explained.     In English?       Yes.     But I would also be curious to see if that decision as properly documented.     Yes.     No I don’t remember.     Yes.     And when you do bring them with their memo’s.     Yes, okay no that’s fine.     Yes I do.     No.     Ja, I can’t recall the detail or the – I remember that vaguely, ja, but I cannot recall the detail.     Which is why want to see the memo.      No, no, no it was – I don’t know 2013 is eight years ago, a lot of things have happened in eight years, I do remember this vaguely but I can’t, I need my memory to be jogged, especially that some of the documents arrived last night, I really need to apply my mind and try to recall properly what happened.       Yes.     Where are the documents?     Come again sir.     Without having won any tender yes.        But where are the documents.    Were they taking over or were they being given.      Were they taking over or were they being given?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, but could this be done legally?     Ja, but – no, no McKinsey is ceding its right to the contract ...[intervenes]      So they were ...[intervenes]      They were coerced into doing this?     What increase?     What increase?     Ja, that was not an increase, but we will get to it.     Yes.     So this is what we got yesterday?     Yes.     What did you want me to see?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.       Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Chairperson and Mr Myburgh you know what you are doing is really unfair, this was given to me yesterday, last night.  We got it last night.   Now you can’t take a document that we received last night and just go to the end of the document and say do you see what is the recommended fee.  What does the body of the document say?   Now as we were talking ...[intervenes]      But Chair even if I am not forced why put me in that position in the first place, because if you look at page 40512, because I just skimmed through this document, it talks about value paid in by the advisor, it says 00512 impact on Transnet, change remuneration model for a transactional riser, and that is written in English and it goes through general amendment principles, budget implication, but Mr Myburgh’s question is going right to the end and saying can you see that 50million.     I do Chairperson.     I would like to leave it, it was given last night and it is not just a matter of going to the conclusion and saying Mr Molefe can you see your culpability there.       That’s what you said you see this is where your involvement is ...[intervenes]      See that 50million. ADV MYBURGH     Yes.     Which ones? ADV MYBURGH    405?      Ja, 2, 4, 5?     .6.     Chair when will we return to these documents?     No Chair, I will go through them and I will take legal advice.     So I am afraid it will not happen overnight.     I am afraid it will not happen overnight.     Yes.      Yes, all the documents that were ...[intervenes]      Ja, I had this about half past seven on Sunday night. 
ADV MOTSEPE:   Good afternoon Chair.    My name is Clifford Motsepe I am with Advocate Sikhakhane and Mpho Molefe.  We are duly instructed Molaba Attorneys on behalf of Mr Molefe.     We just want to put it on record today Chair that we are not going to make any statements.  Thank you.     Mr Molefe has not prepared any statement for this.     Yes he has not prepared any statement.     Thank you Chair.    Chairperson.     Mr Myburgh makes it a conclusion that the Gupta’s were involved in money laundering.     Ja, no I heard differently.      And 00    Thanks Chair.  I have just been instructed by my instructing attorney that we will have to consult with Mr Molefe and thereafter only make a determination whether he will be ready tomorrow to testify on these documents because as he has just indicated I only received them last night at ten o’clock. 
MOLEFE: No, I cannot comment on what ...[intervenes]    Yes, they tried to do deal with …[intervenes]   I do not know Chair. You see ...[intervenes]    Ja, the big companies came with Regiments. 
MYBURGH:  And then they need to explain themselves, did they know, were they asleep at the wheel, were the crooks too cunning or where they complicit and that is really ultimately what the Commission in relation to you will have to decide.  Once you accept there was corruption and money laundering, the question then is, you say you did not know.  Well, why do you say that, why did not know?  Were you diligent enough?  Were you asleep at the wheel?  Were these crooks too cunning for you or were you actually complicit and those are what my questions are directed at.  So it is not that I want any particular outcome, I want to be able or the Commission wants to be able to answer that question.  That is why I am probing you.  So let me just start out by asking you this.  Do …[intervenes]   But, you see, you perhaps I misunderstand what happened.  What you recommended, is you said to McKinsey you must replace Letsema. 
ADV MOLEFE SC:   Chairperson.      Ja, Mr Molefe has already given an answer, he said he did not keep a tab, that is the answer he has given.  
DV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
ADV MOTSEPE SC:    Chair.      I would imagine this is one of the documents that were received last night, and if that is the position, I think Mr Molefe should be granted…[intervene]      I was saying Chair this is one of the documents that has been received last night and if that is the case, Mr Molefe can be given an opportunity to look at this document overnight.       Mr Molefe can be given an opportunity to look at this document overnight if this is one of the documents that we received last night, especially those documents were delayed and others. 
MR MOTSEPE:   So we will liaise with the evidence leader to indicate whether we will be ready tomorrow or not.
