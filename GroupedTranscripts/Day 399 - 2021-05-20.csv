CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Yes. So I just want to …    The media is reminded     The media is reminded and the public are reminded that I issued an order in respect of this witness’ evidence aimed at protecting his identity.  I will not repeat the order everybody knows the substance of the order.  Okay.  Good morning once again Stephen.    Thank you once again for availing yourself to assist the commission.  We appreciate it very much.     Yes.  You have already taken the oath so Mr Pretorius can start.    Ja maybe before you ask the next question Mr Pretorius can you let me ask this.  Stephen yougave a translation for (speaking in vernacular) as my Tsotsi’s.I think that translation is not necessarily inaccurate but do you also agree that can be translated as criminals?    Yes.  And maybe you might be able to say this – to say something about this.  Would it be true that sometimes in the township people use that term for people that – they have some admiration for – they use it in a positive sense even though it is a bad term because if you are a (speaking in vernacular) it means you are involved in crime.  Is that your experience or is that something you do not know?    Yes.    Ja.    Ja no I think I …    Ja I think you are right.  Sometimes it is used in a positive sense by the person who is using theterm but it is normal meaning is that of somebody involved in crime.  Is that right?    Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  I just wanted to make sure whether you have that experience ofunderstanding it is in that way.  Mr Pretorius you may proceed.    Before you do that Mr Pretorius I just once – want to go back to the term just so that I knowwhether Stephen understands it in the same way I understand it.  Now Stephen you have said that you – you live in the township or you have lived in the township.  You know the use of the term Inja in the township?    Inja is the same.    Ja Inja is a dog is it not and ordinarily nobody would like to be called a dog is it not?    But in the township can it be used in a certain positive way among certain people?    Yes.     And..    Yes.  And when it is used the people who are referred to as my dog Injayane they would also not take offence would they?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay alright. Continue Mr Pretorius.     You said Eersterus?     I am sorry.  Did you say Eersterus?  Eersterus, yes.  Yes, Chairperson.     Okay alright.     I am sorry.      I am sorry, Steven.  We did not hear you for a few seconds after you said you spoke to Frank.  So we missed out something.  You want to go back to that part?    Just before the ...[intervenes]     Just before the third one.  Just before the third one, Steven.  Just for the benefit of the public.  The name of Frank you are using is a pseudonym name.  Isthat correct.     Ja, okay.      H’m?     Good morning.     Oh, yes.     Ja, okay alright.  Thank you.     Yes.    Okay.  No, thanks for that.       Yes.    It is an elaboration.     H’m.     Would be.     Ja.     Ja.     To deal with it, ja.  No, that is fine.    Thank you.  You may then proceed, Steven.     Did he cover that, Mr Pretorius?  What is in paragraph 28, did he not cover that already?  You remember he spoke about the – even the ...[intervenes]     Yes, paragraph 28 has been covered.  Iam on paragraph 29.  Yes.     Ja, okay.  I thought you said 28, ja.  And then maybe, Mr Pretorius.  Remember to just ask him to indicate timeframes about the Eersterus visit, for example.     Just to ...[intervenes]     The incidents that you have reflected on and told the Chair about the three incidents.  The first incident, when did that take place?     In 2016?     Yes, that is covered, ja.    Okay.  Mr Pretorius, let us take the tea adjournment.    As it is quarter past.     And then we will come back at half-past.  We will take the tea adjournment, Steven.  We will come back at half-past eleven.  We adjourn.     Thank you, let us proceed.    One second, Steven, I am sorry Steven, just one second?  Mr Pretorius, I do not want to adjourn and talk in chambers, can we do what they do in other jurisdictions, can you approach?     Okay.     When was this?  When did this happen?     Early 2016?    Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius?     And just to make sure, that sentence says Frank informed you that he had delivered the R12 million cash to Minister Mahlobo.    Yes, okay.     How long did you pay this person if you able to remember?    Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius?     Okay.     No, no.  Initially I was called by DDGForeign Branch to come and help her because she was not coping.  This vision 2035 had killed Foreign Branch from being a branch into a Chief Directorate without proper funding.  So they were not coping because the world did not shrink when the Foreign Branch was shrunk.  They had to contend with the world as we know it with limited capacity.  So I was called to come back.  I then asked the DDG that if you call me to come and work, where is the report that says now I am fit for purpose because I am still waiting for the report that I am not fit for purpose.  Thenwhen Mr Jafta was appointed, I was also called back.  I came back this time because Mr Jafta had nothing to do with the fitness for purpose.  He then asked me to go and work in Foreign Branch to assist because there were challenges.  I worked there up until I was brought back tothe Domestic site again.     Thank you very much Steven for availing yourself, you are now excused.     Yes.     H’m.     Yes.     Yes, thank you very much Steven I’ve heard you, thank you very much.  Thank you and then MrPretorius…[intervenes]. UNKNOWN     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, the transcript certainly the parts that constituted or the elaboration should be given and MrPretorius will take care of that, maybe it will be more than that part but that would be taken care of.     Okay, we’ll adjourn for five minutes. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Good afternoon Frank.    Thank you once again for availingyourself to assist the Commission.  We appreciate it very much.    Yes the oath was administered to you earlier this morning, so Mr Pretorius can continue.    And forget to admit Steven’s affidavit.    Ja, okay.     The affidavit of Frank which starts at page 1146.1 will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT YY –what is the number?    16.1.  Ja.  Mr Pretorius I do not want toforget this.      Okay, thank you.    Is it Veza?    Could it be, would it make a difference Frank if the position is that in the conversation you specified the country from where you believe they came. And what is confusing you now is that, in the place of the name of the country it is simply written a foreign country.  Is that what maybe confuses you?    It’s not that?   Yes.    Would, is it possible that what you said was that most of the people were trained from a foreign country and maybe whoever transcribed thought you weresaying they came …    From a foreign country?    Is it possible that …    Ja, you …    You may have said they were trained …    You may have said they were trained from a foreign country, not that they were coming from …    Okay.    Yes.  Okay.    Unless if, if most were relatives of Thulani, would that indicate in any way whether they were South Africans or people from another country or would it not?      If most were relatives of I think he has just referred to as Thulani, if they …    If most were relatives of Thulani, would that indicate whether those who were relatives of Thulaniwere South Africans or were from another country?    You are not sure.    Okay.    Okay, alright.    Ja.    Ja, that is fine.  Maybe during lunch you, you could check with Mr Meyberg, his evening witness from what I recall did not appear in ...[indistinct] somebody who would take very long.  And therefore maybe the 3 o’clock cut off point might not be strictly adhered to for your purposes.    Ja.    Now let us …    [Indistinct].  That is R20 million.       Was that something that you had personal knowledge of or was it something that you had heard about?     Oh, you were talking about occasionswhen you, personally have taken money to the Ministry, that’s what you are talking about?     Alright okay.     Hang on one second Frank, the names you are using for the record, when you said J that’s a pseudonym is that right?    Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius you may have thought about it, I was just asking about the positions they held but they might not be operatives.     Yes, ja okay.     I’m sorry, Frank, just to clarify the distinction.  When reference is made to a member of the SSA, is that different from an employee or official of theSSA?     Okay, so if you – if you are the employee of the SSA who is also authorised or whose duties include being involved in operations you would be a member of the SSA but if you are an employee of SSA whose duties do not include being involved in operationsthen you’ll just be an employee or an official, but you are not a member, is that right?     Oh, what is right just explain it to me?     Oh, to be a member you have to be issued with a specific number?     Oh, okay so those who have not beenissued with such a number would then be, just ordinary employees or officials.     Oh okay.     You would not be at SSA unless you are a member?    Even if you are – no matter what your position is, you would be a member?     Ja that’s what I’m talking about.     Okay, alright, Mr Pretorius?    Yes.     Yes.     What is the correct figure?     Oh okay.     H’m.    In the same Bundle.     He will tell you just now.    I think we should take lunch.     Ja, it’s about seven minutes past one, we’ll take the lunch break and resume at ten past two, weadjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS     Okay, let us continue.  Frank.     Good afternoon. Let us continue, Mr Pretorius.    Yes.     I am sorry.  Frank, just so that I understand, are you able to... [intervenes]    Are you able to explain the distinction between a project and an operation publicly?     Yes, please do that for my benefit.     Yes.     Ja.     Alright.    Oh, so within a project there could be different operations.  Is that right?     Yes and there could be an operation that is not attached to a particular project or an operation must always be attached to a project?     Oh, okay.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius.     Thank you very much.     Did you remember to take off your mask, Frank, after lunch?     Okay.    So is the position that sometimes you would use the word commitment to refer to undertakings orpromises or obligations that you had undertaken that sometimes you would use the word commitment to refer as a code for money?     Okay.  Alright.     Yes, no that is... [intervenes]     Ja.     His response to my question was that they sometimes use the word commitment to refer to undertakings or promises or obligations, but sometimes they used the word as a code for money.     Is that how they were referred to by other people as well?     Okay.     We will help clarify.  You said withdrawal was the wrong word used there.  What was the right word that you said... [intervenes]     Allocation.     So instead of withdrawal of R20 millionit is supposed to be an allocation of R20 million.     Okay.     I think, Mr Pretorius, if there is a recording available it should be made available to him to listen to and compare with the transcript.    And then subsequently he can do an affidavit to say whether where he said it is not correctly recorded he still sticks with [indistinct].     Ja.     Ja.    I am sorry, what... [intervenes]     Mr Pretorius.     922, okay.  Continue.  You may continue.    No, he is speaking to me, Frank.  On mine, Mr Pretorius, the transcript starts at page 845.  I thought you said 842.    It starts at 845.     Okay.  The transcript of an interview involving Frank that starts at page 845 would be admittedas an exhibit and would be marked EXHIBIT YY... [intervenes]     16.     Point 2.  Yes.  And you said you would like me to admit the affidavit as well.     Well, I do not think we did that at thebeginning, but it is important we should do it.  What page does it start?     1146.1.  No, you are right, Mr Pretorius, we did it.     Okay.     933.    What is that stage?     Ja, but what is that stage?  It is the stage of the letter?    Yes, but that page I have got a letter.     Ja, so that letter is dated June 2019.     Ja, that is fine.    Well, we did not do that here, but we would have done it when Dr Mufamadi gave evidence.     The letter?     Ja.     When you finished late yesterday. ADV PRETORIUS     923.     933.     Yes.     It starts at – it actually starts at 934, but the cover page is 933.    Certificate.  I think we start there.     Well, I think let us do it at 932.     Is this transcript is the whole – does the whole of it relate to the interview of Frank?     And it will be 16.3?    Ja, okay.  The transcript of an interview between Frank and the high level panel which starts at page 932 will be admitted and marked as EXHIBIT YY16.3.     The letter of Frank dated 3 June 2019 that appears at page 1034 is admitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT YY16.4.    The page is?     Oh, okay.     Yes.  Yes, Frank.     Pretorius.    Okay.    That is 62.1 huh?   Ja okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.  Okay no that is alright.    Mr Pretorius.    He has asked for a five minutes break.    So let us take that five minutes break.   We adjourn for five minutes. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us continue.    [No audible reply]     Thank you very much Frank.  We, once again, appreciate that you have availed yourself.  I will now excuse you.  You are now excused.    Yes?     Yes.     Ja.     Okay.       Yes, go ahead.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     Yes.    Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Well, mister – well, Frank, what you have said is important.  So I would then suggest that to the extent that you believe that some witnesses have given the Commission a wrong picture or inaccurate picture about the State Security Agency and how things are done there.  I would be interested in hearing your side of seeing things.  So I would encourage you to be in touch with theLegal Team and I would encourage the Legal Team to obtain an affidavit from you to the extent that they might not already have which deals with that aspect.  And if you need to go to certain particular features of the evidence of some of the witnesses who you believe did not give anaccurate picture, I would like you to deal with that in an affidavit.  And then within the constrains, time constrains that the Commission has, we would try and find a way, either for you to come back and deal adequately with that or we could arrange that your affidavit or a summary of your affidavit or the main features of your affidavit be read out to me in a public hearing by an evidence leader so that the public knows what you have to say so that the picture that you believe is not accurate, is corrected at least fromyour point of view.  Would that be fine with you?     Yes.     Okay.     Okay.  No, that is fine.  If you prefer not to come back, that is fine.     I just thought you might ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Okay.  No, that is alright.     And Mr Pretorius will let me know once he has got it and we can have it or at least its main features ...[intervenes]     Yes, perhaps we could extent that invitation to all the material witnesses.    Yes, yes, ja.     Ja.     Yes, yes.  So any witness who feels that the correct picture of SSA has not been given or somewitness gave a picture that is not accurate, they must feel free to be in touch with the Legal Team of the Commission and to depose to affidavits that puts what they believe is the correct picture of the State Security Agency.  But thank you very much, Frank.    Okay thank you.  We are going to adjourn the day session and then we – I am going to come back after 15-minutes and then I will hear the evidence of Ms Gigaba, Norma Gigaba, I believe.  And after that, I will hear the evidence of Mr Peter, I believe.  So I will adjourn for – I think I see the evidence leader for the next work stream.  Mr Myburgh is there.  So I will take a 15-minutes adjournment and then resume.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNSINQUIRY RESUMES     Good afternoon, Mr Myburgh.  Good afternoon, everybody.     Are you ready?     Yes.  Okay.  Ms Gigaba is legally represented?     Yes.  Okay alright.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Okay alright.  Good afternoon, Ms Gigaba.     Your mic is off.     Okay, thank you.  Thank you for coming back.   Okay, Mr Myburgh.     Yes ...[intervenes]     Yes.  But maybe before that.  For thebenefit of the public, you could just indicate why she is back to give evidence.     Yes.     Ja.     H’m.    Yes.     Okay.  No, that is alright.  Please administer the oath or affirmation.    Oh, okay.  Please try again.  Okay.     Thank you.  Okay.     Oh, those have not been conveyed to Mr Myburgh as yet or is he aware of them?  Do you want to ...[intervenes]     Ja.     Okay.  Mr Myburgh, are you of anycorrections to be made?     Oh.     Ja.     Ja, okay let us do that.     Is the affidavit at – oh, the affidavit is 997 – page 977 is the ...[intervenes]    ...the main one?     Okay alright.     Paragraph 66.4?     Oh, page 1015.     Yes, you say that the – so the correction you would like to bring to my attention are corrections that should be made in respect of the main affidavit ...[intervenes]     But ...[intervenes]     Ja, but those corrections are not catered for in the supplementary affidavit?     Okay you can point them out but it would be important to still have then another supplementary affidavit to put them in because otherwise they may bemissed out because we cannot amend the affidavit.     Ja.     Okay.  Point them out.     66.4 paragraph ...[intervenes]     H’m?     Yes.     Okay.     Ja.  Well, where do we find the supplementary affidavit?     Mr Myburgh. ADV MYBURGH     Yes, I have got it.  Okay where do make the corrections?     9.4.  Yes?     Oh, okay.  Okay.  Yes?    Okay.  No, that is fine.     Okay.  I think those are the dates that are important.  But of course, once you do a supplementary affidavit, you may do a third one as well.  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.     You confirm that we are going to be using Transnet Bundle 7?     Ja, okay.     I think someone must assist her.     The affidavit of Ms Norma Mngoma Gigaba that starts at page 1027.8 is admitted and thenwould be marked as Exhibit BB-26.4. AFFIDAVIT OF MS GIGABA IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT BB-26.4     Just before you proceed, Mr Myburgh.  I just want to indicate that subsequent to Ms Gigaba’sappearance last time and in the light of the issues she raised about the Commission not having attended adequately or may not at all, as far as she is concerned, to her security concerns.  I specifically asked the Head of the Investigation Team, Mr Nombembe, to take steps to establish what needs to be done and whether Ms Gigaba still needs security so that her concerns could be addressed and dealt with.  I have been given a report but I do not think that what I have been given is final.  So I just want to indicate that after I have heard your concerns, I did give instructions that you be approached to establish exactly what can still be done in regard to your concerns.       Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Myburgh.     Sorry, what page Mr Myburgh?    Okay.     I am sorry.  Because he had to focus on?     Oh, okay.     Ja.  Mr Myburgh?     Yes. MS     Yes, ja, continue?  Yes, one of the police officers…[intervenes]     No, that is fine, you – I think what MrMyburgh – he just wants to know how much you have covered.     He is not saying do not speak.     Ja, you can speak and …[intervenes]     And ultimately when did they bring them back or did they not bring them back?     And when they came back was the information that – was the information still there that …[intervenes]     And that was not the day they brought back your gadgets?    And how long after did they bring back your …[intervenes]     Once the gadgets were bad were youable to establish whether the kind of information that you say Mr Gigaba had said he wanted to be deleted was still there or not?     Okay.  Mr Myburgh?     Ja, not that is fine.    No.     Well, I do not know – as far as I am concerned it does not have to be admitted, as such.     But it is fine as a matter of convenience.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     I note, Mr Myburgh, that in the document it says about two to three months rather than one or two.     I am sorry.  Are you able to give an indication of about how many times he may have gone there with you over the period, leaving out occasions when he told you that he had been there but you were to rely on his word, you were not there to see whether he was indeed there.  So but the times when you were there with him at the Gupta residence, are you able to say – given an indication?     So and that would span from when to when in terms of years when you say about 20 times?  That is from 20 what, 2011, 2013, 2014 up to when?     Your first time that you went there would have been which year?     Okay, alright.  And the last time when you went there would be?     But you cannot remember which year, but whatever year it was, it was the year when he was [indistinct] back to Home Affairs.    Okay, alright.  And when you say 20 times, about 20 times, I accept that you are estimating.     But if somebody said no, maybe 10 times would that... [intervenes]     10 times it is not.     It is more than that.     So even if you are mistaken about 20 times, it cannot be 10 times or less.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh.     No, that is fine.     Did you say he did not want you to watch the news on television or read the newspapers at home?     So what would happen?  Because he would need to watch news or read newspapers.  Did he not watch news as far as you knew in the house?    Okay.  Alright.  Mr Myburgh.     Well, can I take you back to what you say in paragraph 28, you say that the meetings between Mr Gigaba and Mr Ajay Gupta took place in an underground room of bunker at our home.  I see that in paragraph 72 of     Yes.     That room is the only one that is at that level?     The others are on top?     Ja.     Ja.     So - but is it on the same level as the ground level if you are outside of the house, or is it belowthe ground level if you are outside the house.     Other rooms.     Yes.     The steps go down.     Okay, alright Mr Myburgh.      So which year are we talking about when that trip happened was in 2010?     2015, okay so he had stopped beingMinister of Public Enterprises in 201 when the elections happened, and after that, he became the Minister of Home Affairs.     Ja, okay.    Well, you just said that what you know, is that Mr Gigaba spoke to Mr Gama.     But that is actually not true, because you were not there when he spoke to him.  It is what he told you, is that right?    Ja, okay.      So did you get the impression that the conflicts between them that you are talking about was because Mr Gigaba was resisting Ajay Gupta’s attempts to get him to run the department the way he wanted, and not the way Mr Gigaba wanted?     The Sheraton Hotel is that the one in Pretoria?     Okay.      This is now back to Home Affairs?     You just used the word uBaba[?], who are you referring to?     Okay, alright.    I am sorry Mr Myburgh have you moved away from the BMW?   Oh you go back.    Okay.  Ja.  On the BMW unless you are still going to go back there ja.    Ja.  Yes   You say you kept that car – you drove that car for about a year and a half?   And would there be – I guess there would be friends and other people who knew the car when you were driving it.    Yes.  And did you say it was registered in your name or was it not last time?    When did you get to know that – that part?    When did you get to know that the car was registered in his friend’s name at some stage?   Oh so he – that was done while you were still using it.   Yes okay Mr Myburgh.    It should have been here. But anyway if you are able to (talking over one another)    Ja.    Did you – did you ever see him receive cash from the Gupta’s?    Yes.      No I understand.  So – so you say     Oh.      Okay I am told five minutes break.  Let me – let us adjourn and let me hear what it is about.  Let us adjourn for five minutes and then I will come back.  We adjourn.     With – with Ms Gigaba about an hour.  Okay.  I have been informed that there are security reasons for us to adjourn.  So I know that we were going to hear her evidence and then Mr Pita’s evidence.  So we are going toadjourn.  I am sorry about that it is a situation beyond everyone’s control.  And then we will just have to arrange – if we are left with an hour with her I wonder whether we could do that hour tomorrow if she is available in the morning before we start with Mr Pita.   Well I – I think that we should be able to – we should still be able to come here.    Unless we are advised differently.  I think we should still be able to. Ms Gigaba would you be available tomorrow morning?  How is your situation?  I am sorry your – your mic.  Just switch on your mic.    Your legal attorney.    Ja.  What is your situation like?    Sorry.    Yes.    Ja it would be an hour.    I think with regard to Mr Gigaba we wanted to start at nine.    Ja    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  With us sitting until as late as I thought we would this evening I was tempted to think well maybe ten o’clock instead of nine.    But maybe we should stick to nine and usethat nine to ten for her evidence and then we can take it from there and hear Mr Gigaba.    Gigaba’s evidence after that.      With Mr Pita ja.    Ja.  Okay so is that fine you would be here?  She says she is available if it is just an hour.Yeah I (inaudible).  I will come.    You will come.  Okay thank you very much.Thank you Chairperson.    Ja.    Ja.  Ja that is – that is fine.  We will try.  How long do you think he would be?    Ja we can discuss that ja.   Ja.  Okay alright thank you to everybody for making it possible for us to continue up now at least.  We are going to adjourn then and we will continue tomorrow.   We adjourn.

We need not detailthose at present but you have a history of intelligence activities with the Intelligence arm of the ANC Mkhonto Wesizwe is that correct?    Yes and in 1995 is it correct that youwere absorbed into the New Intelligence Structure of South Africa?    And if we can go on to page 10 the Chair can read the background set out in the other paragraphs but in paragraph 10 it says you were appointing – appointed as acting Deputy Director General Domestic Intelligence, is that correct in 2015?  Let me put it this way the allegations in paragraph 10 are they correct? Can you hear me Stephen?  Stephen can you unmute please.  Inother words switch your microphone on.    And leave it on.    Yes.    Alright so if you would look at paragraph 10 it talks of an appointment in 2015 and are the details in paragraph 10 correct?    Right.  Let us then go to the substance of your affidavit and paragraph. We know that in 15 the State Of Nation Address was set to occur at 19H00 on Thursday the 12 t h of February 2015.  Do you recall that?    Right.  And what notice did the SSA receive regarding the potential for disruption of that event?    Were there concerns about the safety of the President?   Right. And in paragraph 18…    I am sorry I interrupted you.    Right. In paragraph 18 you set outthe steps taken to deal with this threat.  What were those steps?  These are all matters of public knowledge now I might add.  But what were those steps? Paragraph 18.    Right.    Just for the record before you go on.    I am sorry to interrupt you just for clarity sake Nat Joints – N-a-t J-o-i-n-t-s appears to be a joint committee representing various entities in which the SSA plays a leading role, is that correct?    Alright.    Yes.  Okay.     So a jammer was deployed to prevent a drone from being operated at a low altitude at theState of Nation Address, is that correct?    Right.  What do you say in paragraph 19 then?    What was the effect of putting the jammer inside Parliament?    Yes but sorry I did not make it clear.  It would prevent cell phone images being transmitted.    Is that correct?    Did this event or series of events particularly the use of the jamming device in Parliament to block cell phone transmissions raise concern amongst the public and particularly the South African National Editor’s Forum?    Alright.  What did SANAF do?  You deal with that in paragraph22.    Right what did they do? Did they react to the series of events?   Yes.      In paragraph 21 you say that the basis of the South African National Editor’s Forum challenge was an assertion that the public had a right to  know what was happening in Parliament and the…    The jamming device interfered with the exercise of that right.     Another issue you say – is that correct?    You say in paragraph 21 another issue was that television viewers of the Parliamentary broadcast were deprived of the right to see visuals of the EFF MP’s being ejected from the chamber as the camera remained focussed on the Speaker of Parliament and the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces.  Is that correct?   Right.  So what happened then consequent to the launching by SANAF of legal proceedings after the 12 t h of February 2015 in relation to yourself.    Paragraph 23.    Where is this residence?    I am sorry.    Okay.    Right if you would go on please; what happened?    Sorry before you go on.    Can you tell Stephen from the manner in which the term was used and the context within which it was used what meaning the term had for Mr Mahlobo?    Alright let us go back again.    I am sorry I would like to…    I did not want to interrupt you but I wanted to take you back to paragraph 25.    Well perhaps just finally for clarity Stephen in case it becomes a matter of dispute later when referring to the two persons present in the manner he did.  Do you think Mr Mahlobo was intending to insult them oraddress them in a friendly collegial way?    Right.  If I may take you …    I am sorry.    Right.    Right.  Let us go back to before the two men arrived in the lounge.  When you arrived in the lounge as I understand it you were alone with Minister Mahlobo, is that correct?    If you go back to paragraph 25 because we have left out some of your evidence. Did Minister Mahlobo explain to you what the purpose of your visit to him was?   What did he tell you?    Right in paragraph 26 you talk about your relationship with Minister Mahlobo and what you knew of his activities.  What – what did you know?     Apart from those specific incidents. Did you ever come to learn of Mr Mahlobo’s activities or conduct in relation to operations?     Right.     I have not stopped the witness.  It is quite correct.  This is not in the statement.     But generally ...[intervenes]     Yes, it is an elaboration of something said there.     A general statement made that Minister Mahlobo spoke openly to me about operations he ran but I do not want to – I just want to place on record, which I was going to do in any event Chair, is that anything that still needs to be put to Minister Mahlobo will be...[intervenes]     ...subject to the written process of question and answer ...[intervenes]     ...in due course.     So he will have a full opportunity to respond.     Alright.     Alright.  If we could go back then to paragraph 27 and back to the meeting that took place atthe then Minister ’s residence in Pretoria.  Let us go back to the point at which the – you said two men arrived and joined yourself and Minister Mahlobo in the lounge.     Describe the two persons, as youhave described in paragraph 28?  Did a conversation then take place?     What was – between whom did the conversation take place?     Alright.     Alright.  If we could go then to paragraph 29.  Does that cover the issues, Chair?     Please go to paragraph 29 and deal with the conversation that took place as you set out in that paragraph.     Sorry, before you go on.     Can you please ...[intervenes]     ...did it not strike you as odd or strange that two judges in Gauteng would be asked toinfluence two judges in Cape Town?  That seems to be a rather extraordinary proposition.       Yes, we know ...[intervenes]     We know of the litigation.  We need not to go there for the moment.     Right.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  Steven, you were about to tell the Chair of the conversation that occurred between the two persons  who joined the meeting between yourself and Minister Mahlobo.  You deal with that in paragraph 29.  Could you tell the Chair please of thedetail of that conversation?     Which incident was that?     Alright, thank you.  Let us go back then to paragraph 29.     Right, you have dealt with the …[intervenes]     I am sorry, go on, please?     Alright, before we go on to the next issue, may I just ask, do you know or did you know at the time that these two persons who joined the meeting were actually judges?     Yes but other than what Mr Mahlobo told you, did you of your own knowledge know them to be judges?     Right.    And since that meeting have you ever through your recollection of having seen these two gentlemen, have you ever been able to identify them to your knowledge as judges?    Alright.     Right.  Is it correct then that after this meeting you travelled to Cape Town on instructions and assisted in briefing counsel in relation to the aspects relating to the jamming device.    Right.  We do not need to deal with the SONA litigation it is a matter of public record but if we could go to paragraph 48 please on page 310.     Would you just deal with the matters that you testified to in paragraphs 48 and following?     Tell the Chair about that.     The bench?       Thank you, Chair.  Steven, just anote please.  In relation to yourself at any particular time, if you could not mention your – the office that you held or the position that you held and in relation to others too, do not mention what positions they held so that we can stick to the identity rules, if we may.  Okay?     Alright, so tell us about this R12 million.     Did you speak to Frank about this issue?     What did you …[intervenes]     What was the purpose of the 4 million being taken from the 12 million.  I would not know, Advocate, I would not know but there were projects, Mayibuye 1, Mayibuye 2, Project Justice.  I suppose the money could have been for those projects because I came to know about those projects when Minister Mahlobo came to see the former director to push that we must send giving the money for this projects because he is running projects, we cannot be sitting with money.  At that time Special Opshad depleted its budget so I happened to know those project in that context otherwise I would not have known about them because of the need to know.     Alright in paragraphs 48 and 50 you do mention the specific purpose of the delivery of themonies but I take it you are not going to place that evidence on record now.     Right is that because it is not correct, what is stated in the affidavit?     And the money was taken towhom?     So the purpose of the money was related to – or the purpose for which the money was delivered and taken as stated in paragraphs 48 and 50 is what you were told.  You do not know directly, is that correct?    Alright.     Yes so, for example, in paragraph     Alright.     And do you persist in the evidence that you give in the first sentence of paragraph 51 as to what Frank told you?     Let us deal with the next issue then and that is the issue of the establishment of a trade union to rival AMCU.  Did you attend a meeting as set outin paragraph 53 on page 311?     Do not mention any names please but …[intervenes]     Pursuant to that meeting were you ever given an instruction by Minister Mahlobo?     What was that instruction?       Was that …[intervenes]     I am sorry, in paragraph 54 the meeting apparently discussed the fact that…     That a particular person had been kidnapped and threatened and needed money to deal withhis security.     Let us deal with the incident – I am sorry to interrupt you, let us deal with paragraph 54 first.     Yes.     Alright.     Right, you spoke of a second meeting with Minister Mahlobo which is dealt with in paragraph 57.  What happened at that meeting?     Alright.  You deal in paragraph 62 and following with a third security contract.  I do not want to necessarily deal with that now, it is on record, but you confirm the facts set out in paragraph 62 to 67.  Are they correct?     Right.  What happened inSeptember 2016?     What happened …[intervenes]    What happened in regard to yourself?     To you?     Alright.     Yes, what happened in April 2018?     Well, do not mention the…     Thank you.  Former Minister Mahlobo is aware of the evidence that you have given by way of notice and otherwise and it has been put to him in his own evidence and he used the term in respect of you, a peddler, an information peddler.  What is your response?     Steven, the accusation that you are a pedlar was based, amongst other things, on Mr Mahlobo’s denial of the meeting that took place between the two persons whom he referred to as Judges and yourself at the former Minister ’s home.  As I understand hisversion, you made the whole thing up, what is your response to that?     It was somewhat difficult to follow, the answers to questions, put to former Minister Mahlobo inrelation to why you would invent, in its totality, the story about the persons whom he said were Judges but as I understand it, in summary he suggested that you might be part of a faction within state security that sought to create problems or discredit him and others, what is yourresponse to that?     He also referred, that is former Minister Mahlobo, also referred to an investigation when pressed in questions about you being known to him to be a pedlar and being asked, well, what was done about it?  Are you aware of any investigation that took place within theSSA in regard to whether you reported false information?     So, do I understand your evidenceyou have never been warned about peddling false information, you are not aware of any investigation conducted in relation to the peddling of false information and I suppose it follows that no inquiry ever, has taken place in that regard?    Bear with me a moment, Chair.  Thank you Chair.     Thank you Steven.     Two things will be done Chair, the transcript of these proceedings will be made available to all parties implicated by additional evidence or elaborating evidence and secondly questions will, in addition to that, be put but Minister Mahlobo certainly – Deputy Minister Mahlobo certainly will be invited to make whatever comment he wishes quite apart from the questions thathe’s been asked.     Chair, just to set-up, may we take a five minute adjournment please?    Frank are you present, can you hear us?   Right Frank …    Before you should be a file containing various documents, including documents behind the folder YY16.  You have that in front of you?   Okay.  There are a number of documents that I will ask be admitted, including an affidavit which we will deal with now.  But if you could go Frank to page 1146.1 towards the end of that divider.      Ja, going to do that now.      So are you at YY16 and at page 1146.1?   No, no.    1146. 1-1-4-6.    1146.1.  Is that your affidavit?  Been identified by your attorney already?    Right, if you would go to page 1146.34.      1146.34.      You got that.   That signature has been redacted, but do you recall signing this affidavit?    And as far as you are concerned, and to the best of your knowledge are the contents of this affidavit true and correct?    Chair, may that then be admitted as EXHIBIT YY16.1?   16.1    Oh.      Frank is it correct and I am now going to page 836 of EXHIBIT YY16, that on the 19 t h of January a request for …    Page 836.  I am only going to refer now to the page numbers in the top left hand column, the black page numbers.   Top left hand corner, page 836.    Yeah, no, no, not the affidavit.      Page …    And 36.    On the 19 t h of January 2021 …   The Commission sent to you are request for an affidavit.  Correct?    And that was followed up by a letterdated the 9 t h of February 2021 on page 841.      And Ms Jabulani Lavuno and Advocate Sam Ngiba were they your representatives at the time, 9 t h February 2021?    Okay.  Contents of those letters are self-explanatory.  And I do not want to deal with them in any detail.  Is it correct that on the 6 t h of November 2019 an interview was conducted internally with an SSA as partof the Veza investigation?      Veza.    Yes, page 845.     That is a transcript that was provided to us by the SSA and do you confirm that you were indeed interviewed on that date?   Yes.  All I want to put to you at this stage is the fact that you were interviewed.  I will put passages to you and can comment on whether those passages accord with your own memory of what happened in that investigation.  So you will have a chance to comment.  But when you say it was not shared with you by the investigators, you are referring to the SSA investigators, is that correct?     Alright.  If you could go to page 861 please.      As part of the project being referred to there, to your knowledge who were the persons who received protection under the rubric of the project there being discussed?  First of all what project was discussed at page 861?  And then who were the persons being protected?   If you look at page 861.    During the course of the interview it appears from this transcript that you were being askedquestions about a particular project.  You see that?    Two thirds down the road or down the page rather, two thirds down the page a project is mentioned, what project is that?    Alright, Project Construção.  Now as part of Project Construção who received VIP protection?    At the time who was Colin Maynier, what office did he hold?    Youth league?    And was there a third person who received protection?    Who was that?    Of the ANC youth league?    Right.  And you say just above the    Alright it is two thirds down the page 861.    Next to the word in red Frank.    It reads   Is that correct?  Is that correct?    Right.  And then in page – sorry.  And then on page 860 you refer to co-workers.  Or co-workers are referred to in the transcript.  Do you see that?    Were co-workers employed or pointed to conduct operations such as Project Construção?    Yes please.    But do you have a mask on?    Won’t you take it off please and make sure that nobody is near you?  So that I am having difficulty in hearing your words.     Thank you.  Explain who were co-workers.    Well are you saying you did not say that?  That part of the transcript?    Well next to the word Frank, one    Right.  Did you say that apart from the fact that they came from a foreign country?    Right.  And further down that page, mention is made of the fact that at least some of these co-workers were relatives of people involved in SSA.  You see that?    Well you say two thirds down the    No?    But what was misconstrued?  It is just a recording of what was said.    No one is construing anything.  It is just a recording of what was said, so all that I think that Iam asking you is, did you say this or did you not say this?    So someone must have inserted this in this transcript, is that what you are suggesting?      But further down the page the    A incorrect record of what you did say.      Alright.  Who were employed as co-workers?    Alright.   Yes.  If we could go to page 892 please.     And I want to first ask you about what appears on this page, the bottom one third of the    Alright.  Did you write the operational plan for Project Wave?    What was the purpose of ProjectWave?    Alright, there was no spec of the project that we will deal with later.  We do not need to take that any further for the present.  You could go with me to – if you would bare with me Chair because I am trying to up-down …    Given time constraints.    I should ...[indistinct] adjournment.   If you could go to page 898 please.  Again two thirds …    Two thirds down the page.     Page 898.      It says next to the word Frank   R20 million, yes.   “He was stopping at nothing that Lilly must make it available because I was close to …”Then that sentence ends there.  But I wanted to ask you was this matter discussed during this interview.      Do you know what the purpose of the request for R20 million in relation to the execution ofProject Wave was?  Or?    Alright.  Page 901.      Two thirds down the page.  You see    Yes.  Well to you knowledge what is the difference between the minister and the ministry?    Right.  Did you as part …    I am sorry.   Yes.  We will deal with that later when we get to your affidavit Frank.    But for the moment do I understand your evidence to be that you told the investigators in the Veza investigation that money was being taken to the ministry.  Is that correct?    Is that a correct statement, a fact you were obviously telling them the truth?    Is it correct then that money for the execution of SSA Project was according to your evidencetaken to the ministry?     On page 902 in the third line yousay, “No, it was not always me ma’am or it is recorded that you said, no it is not always me ma’am so I would deliver this money to the office”,Is that the office of the Ministry, is that correct?     Now, when you delivered money to the office or to the Ministry to whom did you deliver the money?     J is that Jay?     What officials, what office did they hold?     Well, they – that’s what I wanted toget to.     Were these persons members of the SSA or operatives?     In the office of the Ministry?     And the other one?    Just an employee at the office of the Ministry is that correct, not a SSA member or operative?     What was his name?     I’m sorry.     Alright, is that the second person?     Yes, could I ask you to go to page 905 please.     The first paragraph on that page, line three reads as follows,“So, when that happened ma’am that’s how the Ministry took over the project.  It went out of my hand, I know nothing about it, the subject was paid from the Minister ’s office, I would draw the money under Ops Lock, deliver the money to them at the Ministry, they would sign for it, either two pseudonyms, Bokani or Jay, he would sign for the money they would go and deliver and bring back the certificate.  They would take the money and I would take the certificate, I would settle like that.  Therewas another project, for example, Ops Justice there was money being drawn, that money started as R1.3million up to R21.8million I used to draw that money”,Did that discussion take place?     Ja, so apart from the figures and the context, and I’ll come to the context now, is it – did this discussion take place as recorded here?     Yes, let’s go back then to page 904, you do, in fairness deal with the context there.     904, two thirds down the page.     So, you were asked, “Do you think and the name there is the subject of Operation Lock, has a relationship with the former President Zuma”.      Two thirds down the page, or three quarters down the page, 904.    You there, Frank says, “He didn’t have but he had, did they meet, in answer to the question, do you think the subject has a relationship with the former President Zuma.  Ithink they met, because one thing that I intervened was him, at one point, wanting to go meet the President with Thando and I said but where is this man going to meet the President.  Even with my discussion with the President I said, but baba he only said to me, now that I’m telling you what the President said to me, he said that this man, at one point was helpful to him especially when he was released.  He helped him with some things but when I went to ask him, but why do we have arelationship with this particular person, but why are we allowing and the question is, the President saw his value, that’s the former President.  Frank, at that time he said he had a point that’s why they’re working.  Then I said in my intervention, I’ve got that report ma’am, I said even – I even said in my intervention, this is a problem that we are sitting with.  We can no long, the Minister for example has promised this guy R3million”,Did this discussion take place?    Alright so…[intervenes].     I’m sorry I missed that Chair.     Thank you, Chair.  Hello, Frank, again.  Frank, we are on page 905 of wire 16.     Yes, please.     At the end of the first paragraph the following appears.  There was another project for example Ops Justice, there was money being drawn and then there is a reference to figures which you have dealt with.  I used to draw that money.  The question is asked why.  The answer that you give is deliver because it was an instruction and the question then is where did it go and the answer is it would go to the Minister.Did thatconversation take place?     So you say it should read the Ministry?    Now when you refer to the Ministry, I take it you are referring to officials within the Ministry rather than the building.     Correct.  Now from all the knowledge that you had and the context that you have described, these officials, were they acting in their official capacity as officials of the Ministry?     Yes, but now we are talking about Justice now, huh?     Okay, fine.     And then it goes on to say for whatpurpose. “Frank - they knew who they were dealing with.  Remember that there was a point where Justice was complaining that...”     Right.  So there was a project that had something to do with judges and a person within theMinistry was paid – being paid money to deliver that money in execution of that project.  Is that correct?     Yes.  I am sorry, that technical distinction sometimes eludes me.  An operation.  But otherwise my proposition, do you agree with it?     Yes.     Let us go a little further down the page, the next paragraph. “Frank - no it was meant to deal with the issues ofthe judge.  Actually let me not confirm whether this person is a judge or not.  I do not know.  All I know is that I am delivering this money to the office to deal with the issue of the judges.  That is the one thing I know.”Did that conversation happen as stated there?     Yes, so in so far as you were referring to Operation Justice, that conversation did happen?     Yes and what is said in the first three lines of that paragraph, that is correct from your point of view as I understand it?     I am sorry, I interrupted you.  Whatdid you say?     Yes, so I am coming to that now.    Okay.  I am only dealing in the questions to date or to this point with the first three lines as it deals with Operation Justice.Then you do change... [intervenes]     The topic does change.  You say then there was another money, 2.5 million I think we used to take.  They used to call this money Commitment.  That is another issue as I understand it.  Commitment is anotheroperation.  Is that correct?     Right.     And then you asked what was it for     Right.  So you did get a call from the Minister saying that the money must be made... [intervenes]    Sorry, let me finish the question please.     Alright, you make your answer, I will then ask the question.     Yes, so I interrupted you.  I am sorry.  The technical issues are difficult.  Give your answer and then I will ask my question.     So I understand your evidence to be that even though there is a clear distinction in this text here between the Minister on the one hand and the Ministry on the other.  The Minister having made the call and the money being taken to the Ministry.  You say that iswrong.  It should be the Ministry in both.     Alright.     Alright.  So what emerges from that is that this recordal here appears to be correct, firstly, andsecondly that the Minister knew about the monies being paid to the Ministry.     Yes and he spoke to you personally about this as you say in this paragraph.     Alright.  Thank you.  The R2.5 million or the project referred to in relation to the R2.5 million appears later at the bottom of the page to be in regard to Commitment.  Do you see that?  It is a name we have heard before in evidence.     The reception is not good.  I have messaged or I have asked that the technicians be messaged on the other side to deal with the... [intervenes]     The connection is not good.    But we will be patient.     Alright.  Well, whatever the case, we have heard the word commitment in another context, but that we can deal with in due course.  What I want to refer you to, please, Frank, is the top of page 906.    Kim says, in terms of where you     So were the words ‘project of the President’ in that context used by you?     What is a presidential project?     So whether it was project of the President or presidential project, those words were used.    Well, what is it?  You have said presidential project and you have said projects at the presidential level.  What words were used?     Alright.  Now what is a project at the presidential level?     I would like you to go to page 909, please.     The last line, Demi is recorded as     And do you confirm that you said that that was irregular, that particular withdrawal?     Well, I am asking you the question,if I may, because... [intervenes]     Well, I asked you... [intervenes]     But then you say or it is recorded     Alright.  I must just say, Frank, thatwe do have a recording of the interview in fairness to you that is the source of this transcription.  So if you need to listen to that or obtain it, we can possibly make it available to you, but I just want to place on record that this according to the investigators... [intervenes]     Let me finish.  Let me finish, please.     That this is according to theinvestigators an accurate transcript of a tape recording of the interview.  We can move on then to page 922.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, we will do so.  That would be very useful.     Because then we have it in its totality.     Let us go to page 922 if you will.     I do not want to go into too much detail now because we are really pressed for time, Frank, but there is a discussion here about two amounts, one R20 000 which is R20 000 extra and an amount of R300 000 from halfway down the page to the bottom.  Do you see that?     Did that conversation take place?    Page 922.     Yes.  Demi asks you two-thirds the     It is not clear... [intervenes]     No, but I just want to know whether you said the words ‘money that was meant for Mahlobo would leave here to the Ministry’.  Did you use those words?  If necessary we can check on the transcript recording.    And you say you cannot remember saying money that was meant for Mahlobo would leave here to the Ministry?     You cannot remember that.     And if we give you the transcriptyou can confirm with us whether you said that.     Right.  If we could please then move on to – Chair, can we admit this as EXHIBIT YY16.2?  The affidavit is YY16.1 and this transcript beginning at page 845 would that be YY16.2.     Yes.     Yes.     16.     Point 2.     Yes, as 16.1.  I think we have done that, but [indistinct].     The affidavit appears at 1146.1.     Yes.  It was at that stage that you called me forward.     Are you at page 933, please?     Yes.     At page 933 is a certificate of veracity completed it appears by Gauteng Transcribers andthen there is a transcript of an interview at page 934 and following.  It appears that – well, let me ask you.  Were you interviewed by Mr Mufamadi as part of the high level review panel investigation?     And if we could go to page 1010, please.  Well, before that let us go to... [intervenes]     I am sorry.  Let us go to page 950.     Yes.     On the first half of the page it appears from the transcript at least that you told the panel about Operation Justice.Did you tell them about Operation Justice?     And the content of the first half is consistent with evidence you have already given in that regard.  Do you have any comment?    Alright.  At 975 if you would go there, please.     Yes, please.    Alright.  That speaks about Operation Lock and traverses issues that we have already traversed.  Can you confirm that you told the high level review panel about Operation Lock?     And then if we can go to 1010, please.     At the bottom of page 1010 you will recall there is... [intervenes]     Right.  At the bottom of the page     And it is correct, is it?     Then let us go over the page to 11, the second paragraph.     You are recorded as having been asked – well, not asked, but speaking about Project Justice     It took place... [intervenes]     I am sorry, I interrupted you.     Yes.  Can I ask whether what you said here was to the best of your knowledge what you knew correct?    Well, you knew as I understand it, and correct me if I am wrong, that within Project Justice, we, that is the SSA, were paying a lot of money a month.  Is that correct?     And it goes on to say, and thesemonies were said to be paid to a certain set of judges.  Is this what was said?     Sorry, just say that again.  These monies were paid... [intervenes]     Alright.  Did you say however ‘and these monies were said to be paid to a certain set ofjudges’.  Did you say that?     No, no.     Alright... [intervenes]     Okay.  You say your understanding of what you learnt was that they were paid – the money was paid to deal with a set of judges... [intervenes]     ...and you did not say, as I understand your evidence, and these monies were said to be paid to a certain set of judges.     Alright.  Well, again we have the recording.  We will provide the recording to you and we will ask you questions in relation to the recording, okay.     Because the last sentence of that paragraph says, that where – I presume it means were, that were working on high profile cases and so forth and so forth.  That sentence only makes sense if the money was paid to judges.  At least that is something that can beextrapolated or inferred from that.  Maybe it is not the only interpretation.  What do you say about that?     Alright.  Let us get the transcript and we can clarify that in later questions.  Right, then the next page, page 1012 and this in fairness to you when you placed matters of the Minister and the Ministry in its context, I just want to put this on record.  In the middle of     Yes, subject of course to all theevidence that you have given about the Minister ’s knowledge and his phone calls and the like.  But that is all in the transcript and I do not want to go back there.  Then on page 1013, line 10, Mr Frank is recorded as having     Alright.  The passage at the bottom of the page is inconclusive, but we may ask you about that later.  If I could just take you then to page 1036.     At a stage you were suspended.  Is that correct or... [intervenes]     Is that correct?     Page 1034.     No, no, no, page 1034 of the bundle, Chair.     Yes, that is correct.     3 June 2019, yes.  I am going to ask about this letter, but in leading up to that question I must first establish as Mr Frank would want the context, Chair.       You were suspended, Frank?     And this letter at page 1034 appears to be a letter written by yourself requesting a review of the suspension of yourself.  Correct?     Did you write this letter or did you have this letter written on your behalf?     You wrote it personally.    And can we rely on its contents as being true and correct?     Could this be EXHIBIT YY – no, thetranscript, the Mufamadi panel transcript should be EXHIBIT YY3, Chair.  I do not know if we have done that.     Now I am not sure whether this was admitted with Mufamadi, but perhaps it could be admitted again just for safety’s sake.     No, no, Chair, I am going back.  Sorry, I am confusing issues.    But it is in the nature of the time of day.  Page 933... [intervenes]     933.     That is the... [intervenes]    ...Mufamadi panel transcript.  If that could be admitted as YY3.     Yes, Chair.  Certificate of veracity.      Well, in fact the cover page is at 932, but I do not want to confuse issues, Chair.     Right.  Page 932 as YY3.     Yes, Chair, only Frank.     16.3, yes.  YY16.3.     And then, Chair, if I may ask you please at page 1034 to admit that letter that has just been identified by Frank as YY16.4.     Frank, you say that the contents of this letter we can rely on as being correct.  It was penned by yourself.     Go to page 1036, please, and I justwant to very briefly put the paragraphs in the middle of the page on record where you say under the head ‘members     And there of course commitment is used in a different context.  It appears to refer to a specific project or operation rather than just a general reference toa promise or undertaking.  Correct?     Thank you.  Let us then go on, please, to your own affidavit which appears as EXHIBIT YY16.1 at page 1146.1.    1146.1.     I am going to go through it fairly fast because we do not have much more time.  We can go to paragraph 8, please.     Page 1146.3, paragraph 8.  1146.3.     Are those facts correct?     Right and then at paragraph 14 on page 1146.4 you talk of Project Constração and you speak in paragraph 14 of recruits coming from outside the intelligence environment and these recruits were also trained in firearm handling.  Is that correct?    We could go then to – well, I am not going to – well, perhaps I should, other witnesses given evidence in this regard.  Firearms – you say in     Then if we go on, please, to 1146.7, I just want to ask you generally, please, is it correct that... [intervenes]     6.7.     1146.7.     Is it correct that on occasion the SSA would employ external service providers companies toundertake tasks on its behalf?     Alright and what you say here in detail is indeed correct in that regard.  Is that correct?     The statements in paragraphs 38 and following at page 1146.9 regarding Ntwanano Tours & Travel, are those statements correct?     Oh, my apologies, it is not – I am sorry.     I mispronounced [indistinct].  You would never guess the spelling from my bad pronunciation. I would like to go to paragraph 44 that is on page 1146.10.     Were there dealings with the company mentioned there?  Its pseudonym is Kale, K-a-l-e.     And were you introduced to the relevant persons connected to Kale by Mr Dlomo and/or Minister Mahlobo?     And can you confirm that an amount of R12 million was allocated for that operation?     Right.  Then on page 1146.11 you give details in relation to Project Constração.  I am notgoing to put those all on record, but those are set out there and as far as you know they are correct.  Is that so?     And then on page 1146.12 you deal with Project Wave.  It was spelt there W-a-i-v-e.  It should be W-a-v-e as I understand it.  Correct?     Right.  You say in paragraph 54    And then 50 – or it is numbered     But you do speak here of targeted journalists being recruited.  Do you see that?     Is that correct?     You do frankly admit – sorry, I did not mean that.  You do candidly admit that your wife was involved in a particular company and one of your children was recruited.  Is that correct in the context of what you say in paragraph 55 for your daughter?  Is that correct?     And you do say children and relatives of other members within CDSO and SSA were recruited.     Yes.  Paragraph 56 reads    Yes, of course.    Alright.  But it is important also in fairness to mention that you do say that that company received no financial benefit.    Alright then on page 1146.14.    You record your knowledge of Project Mayibuye, you see that?   And you say in paragraph 58 “I generated the memo requesting the establishment of this project at the request and briefing given to me by Mr Dlomo in a meeting attended by myself and two others.”   Right.  And in paragraph 52 you say   And then in paragraph 61.1 you describe Operation Justice.  We have dealt with that.    And you say at the end of that    Well you do mention R1.3 million and R1.8 million on a monthly basis for the purpose of the operation.  Is that correct as far as you know?   Such funds…    You say were dispensed to the office of the then Minister of State Security Mahlobo.  Is thatcorrect?    And then Operation Lock is referred to in paragraph 61.2 again the last sentence of that    And then Operation Seskona you deal with in paragraph 61.3 and you describe its origins.    Being a consultative meeting that took place in the presence of various persons including Minister Mahlobo.  Correct?    Yes and then paragraph 61.4 you refer to Operation Safe Return being an operation designed to penetrate, investigate in order to confirm or refute the involvement of the then newly formed political party in the destabilisation of the Bojanala region in the North West Province – Bojanala region of the North West Province.  Is that correct?     Then in paragraph 61.5 you say the    And then paragraph 62 you deal with    And Project Khusela’s operational needs it appears from paragraph 6.1 arose out of the establishment of the toxicology unit or operation. Correct?    About which we have heard in evidence.  Is that correct?   Project Khusela’s operational needs included the requirements or the needs of the team of the counter intelligence named Toxicologist forming part of the Presidential support operations. Correct?   Alright.  But that is all there in the – in the paragraph.    Is that correct?    62.1 yes I apologise Chair.  On page 1146.16.  Then it seems that in paragraph 74 you respond to a number of documents – operational documents.    That were provided to you by the commission’s investigators.  You were asked for you response and you give your response.  Do I understand the position correctly?  You were given a pack of documents –financial documents – documentary evidence.    And I stress documentary evidence in relation to various transactions.      So in the left hand column of the table that appears at 1146.20 and the following pages there is a brief description of the transaction as recorded in the documents and referenced to your name.  Is that correct?    And in the right hand column are your comments.      Alright now I am only going to refer to a few.  If you could go to page 1146.25.   Are you there?    You will see there is a document referred to in the extreme left hand column as M3.    Right now before we go on I am afraid I am going to confuse you a little.  There is another bundle.    Bundle SSA1.  Do the persons who are with you.    Have that bundle and can they give it you please.   They are ahead of me then.  Thank you.  If you could go to SSA1 page 01 page 378.    378.    Yes.      Yes I did.    Right on that page certain details appear.    Which are detailed in the left hand column of the table that appears on 1146.25.    That document is a declassified document.  It is the Financial Record received by the investigators from the SSA.  It is headed Certificate of Receiving Cash.   And your name appears at the top.      Page 378 of SSA01.    Are you there?    You see it is a certificate of receiving cash.    And the name of the person giving the cash is Frank that is you, is it?    And the amount is R2.5 million. R2 500 000.00 and the reason for giving cash is OperationMayibuye.  You see that?  Whose signature is that below there?    Your signature and it is dated the 8 t h of July 2015.    Yes and the name of the recipient is recorded here as a pseudonym as being Lilly but that is what has been inserted as a pseudonym together with your name inserted as a pseudonym.  Now your explanation   Please.    Yes of course.    Right now you need not mention the name of any person.    I am sorry.    Who was the relevant recipient?    You would not know?    Yes well all the evidence we have so far is that monies for Project Mayibuye were delivered to the Ministry.Would that be consistent with your knowledge?   Yes I understand that but what I am putting to you is we have other evidence that states that monies in the amount of R2.5 million were delivered for Project Commitment or Operation Commitment – I am mixing it up again I am sorry and delivered to the Ministry.   Yes. And that is consistent with your knowledge is it?    Right.  Then let us go on please to M14 on page 1146.      Well I am going to ask you – yes.  So the bundle with your affidavit in.    Deals with the issue of M14 at 1146.26.    And if I can take…   Yes.  1146.26 M14.    Are you there?    Now if I can take you to the other bundle, Bundle 1 at page 449.      Right.      You will see another certificate of receiving cash.  This is a declassified document from the financial records of the SSA.      The name of the person giving cashand we will have to redact a portion of those – or those initials as they appear there in part but it is Frank.  Do you see that?    The amount is R2.5 million.    Reason for giving cash Operation Mayibuye and the word thereafter seems to be Commitment, you see that?    Right.  And the signature is the same as the previous one is that your signature?    And the date is the 30 t h of June 16.  You see that?    And then there is a recipient’s signature I do not think we need go there but do you know who that person is rather than give his name?    Is he a person at the Ministry by any chance?    Alright do not worry about that.  Soonce again we have a financial record that talks of the receipt of cash in amount of R2.5 million for the purposes of the Operation Mayibuye, Project Commitment.  Correct?    Now there are two documents under    Right but at least what we know from the document as confirmed by your evidence that there is a financial record of R2.5 million in cash being withdrawn from SSA for the purposes of the implementation ofCommitment.  Correct?  Project Commitment.    Alright.  Then let us – before you – do not worry there is something I wanted to point out but I will come back to it in a moment.  If you could go to 1146.27please.  M15.    Against the document number M15.    Now there are several documents.    I am sorry Chair I am just getting the document that I want to put.    And I am going to be in time.   Sorry Chair.    Sure.    Thank you Chair.     Hello, Frank.  Thank you, Chair.     If I could take you, please, to page 1146.27 and the documents ...[intervenes]     ...in 15.     And if I may take you to the other bundle, Bundle 1 at page 463?     Right.  Again, this is a certificate of receiving of receiving cash.  It has been classified, extract from the financial records of the SSA.  Name of the person getting cash, Frank.Amount, R 2.5 million.  Reason for giving cash, Operation Mayibuye.  Underneath that, commitment.  Date, 30 June 2016.  I am going to go through all the documents if I may and then ask for your comment.At page 464 of Bundle 1.  The name of person – a similar document.  Name of person giving cash, Frank. Amount, R 1.4 million.  Reason for giving cash, Project Mayibuye, Operation Justice.  Date, 9 June 2016.The third document at page 465.  Amount, R 1.4 million.  Name of person giving cash, Frank.  Amount in words, one million four hundred thousand rand only. Reason for giving cash, Operation Justice (Mayibuye).  Date, 30 June 2016.  Another document.  Similar document.  Page 466 of Bundle 1.  Name of person giving cash, Frank.  Amount, R 300 000,00.  Amount in words, three hundred thousand rand.  Reason for giving cash, Operation Lock.  Date, 30 June 2016.And finally.  Page 467.  A similar document.  That is a certificate of receiving cash.  Name of person giving cash, Frank.  Amount, R 200 000,00.  Reason forgiving cash.  And this becomes a little bit difficult to read but R 30 000,00 remuneration.Operation, Lock.  R 70 000,00 it appears.Logistics and expenses.  Signature, 30 June 2016.  Name of recipient,  Correctional Officer.  And at the bottom of the page is a note.  R 30 000,00 remuneration.  R 100 000,00.  Current invoice, R 70 000,00.  Current ops expenditure.  But appears to be related to Ops Lock.  Now those documents were described on page 1146.27 in a table to you.  And your comment in the right-    So I take it, you have no difficulty with the contents of the document or the description in theleft-hand column?     I am sorry.  I did not hear that.     Alright.  Now if you would look at the description of the document on the left-hand page and it may not be apparent because of the redaction but ...[intervenes]     ...the investigators described the documents in M15 as – and I am looking at the bottom half of page 1146.27.  Cash receipt, 30 June 2016.  Operation Mayibuye.  Commitment, R 2.5 million handed over by Frank to, and there is a name, right?  And then underneath that.  Cash receipt, 30 June 2016.  Operation Justice.  R 1.4 million handed over by Frank to, and then there is another name.       Now because of the similarity ofthat name to a different name, I am going to be asked that it be redacted.  But is that person – does that person work at a place that we have mentioned in evidence?     And what is that place?    Yes.     Is that the ministry?     Yes.  No, I am talking about...  Oh.  No, no, no.  I am not talking about 1146.28.  I am talking about, the bottom of the page, 1146.27.     Do you see there?     It was handed over by Frank too and we are not going to mention that name.     And then handed over by Frank to another name.     My understanding is that that person works at the ministry.    Yes.  Alright.  You deal with certain other facts on page 1146.30 and following.  Do you have anything to add?     Well, we have finished with the tables in relation to documents.     We are not going to deal with anymore but at page 1146.30, your affidavit continues.  It is there for the record.       I do not intend to ask you any questions unless you have anything you wish to say?     Thank you.  Chair, if you bear with me for a moment, please?     Other projects are mentioned but I take it as they are mentioned in your affidavit or in your commentary, we can rely on that evidence as being correct.     Alright.  Okay, Frank.  Subject to your confirmation that the transcripts of your interviews with the Internal SSA Investigator and with the MfumadiPanel, our concern – we will let your legal representative have those.  I have no further questions, Chair.     Chair, and if I may make a comment.  From whatever perspective and whatever role was played or alleged to have been played, all witnesses seem to recognise that there are problems.     And that there may be solutions and perhaps they could deal with that issues as well. 
STEVEN:  I am here Sir.    Good morning Chairperson.    It is a pleasure Chairperson.    Thank you Chair.      Advocate I have it.    Yes I do.    Yes it is my affidavit Advocate Pretorius.   It is my signature Advocate.    Yes that is so.    That is correct Chairperson – Advocate.    That is true.    Yes I can.    I did.     I did.  I did.  I did.    That is correct.   I recall that Advocate.   What we received at the time was that one political party in Parliament met the former President to address the joint sitting of Parliament.  Our task was to ensure that the President of the Republic is able to address the Joint Sitting of Parliament.  That is what we know – knew at the time.    Yes there were concerns about the safety of the President.    Because of the…    I am saying because of what was then generally known in public that certain political organisations in Parliament were not happy that the President was going to address the Joint Sitting.    The steps that we had to put in place as the National Joints because when we deal with events of suchmagnitudes – magnitude it may not necessarily be the State of the Nation but even events such as elections we work within the auspices of the National Joints.  So in terms of the decision that we took as a National Joint based on the threat assessment at the time ordinarily when there is a sitting of that nature the SONA there are role players. The military is part of the Nat Joints SSA, it is part of the Nat Joints and the lead department is SAPS who then becomes the Chair of the Nat Joints.  SSA becomes the co-chair as well as the defence.   So …    (inaudible)    Yes but it is not SSA that plays a leading role.  It is the SAPS that is the Chair.  The two departmentsmeaning SSA and the Defence are co-chairs of the National Joint Intelligence structure.    In brief Nat Joints.    So as a rule when the sitting of Parliament we normally ask our colleagues in the Defence from the Joint perspective that they must ensure that the – there is no fly zone – the Parliament precinct becomes a no fly zone.  But below a certain radius the military cannot enforce the flying of smaller devices such as drones that is where the SSA then came in to deploy the device that we deployed which eventually jammed the signals in Parliament.    That is correct.    The – this is correct it is true that the jamming device was to be placed outside the chambers in a position where the former President was supposed to take the final salute before he enters the chamber.  Then after that the jammer was supposed to be removed from sight because that is the area which was identified for that purpose.  Butwhat then happened a decision was taken without the knowledge of the Joint chiefs by Mr Thulani Dlomo.  The jammer ended up being deployed inside the chamber in the gallery where the visitors are allowed to access Parliament on that day.  That is what happened that day   The effect would have meant that cell phones were not going to be able to function on that day if that jamming device was placed inside at the chamber.  Because the jamming device is – is operating on a radio signal. So it interferes with other radio signal and the cell phone works on the basis of that signal – the radio signals.  So it confuses the – the cell phone device – the GSM system and as a result of that cell phones would not function.  That wasthe effect of placing the jammer inside the chamber. ADV PRETORIUS    No – no because the jamming device does not interfere with the terrestrial lines.  The billing of what is happening in Parliament is based on terrestrial lines.  So there would not have been any interference in terms of thejamming device and the billing of the activities inside the chamber.    Yes.   That is correct.  That is correct.    That is correct.  Not only the SANAF I think South Africans as a whole were not happy with what happened on that day.   SANAF is the – SANAF is the organ – is the organisation that represents journalists.I think it represents editors.  That is where they are feeling dumb.  I would like to think that it is the board that represents them in the affairs that may affect journalism or journalists as it were.    Yes they did they filed – they actually challenged this issue at court in Cape Town meaning they challenged the State Security that we – we did something that was untoward and we did not have a mandate to place such a device in the chamber.  So we were challenged.   In other words we were being sued.    That is correct.    That is correct.   That is correct.    That is correct Sir.    (Inaudible)   After that there was an outcry – after the jamming then Minister Mahlobo instructed me to meet with him at his official residence in Tshwane.  I did go to his house.  I was in the company of my colleague who was assisting me in terms of moving me from point A to point B.  We arrived at Minister Mahlobo’s residence.  I entered the house alone.  I found him inside the house but at the gate – maybe let me first describe what the situation was like at the official residence of Mr Mahlobo.Every time I am requested to or instructed to come to Mr Mahlobo’s house – Minister Mahlobo’s house his protectors would be outside the residence at the gate to usher me in because inside the yard there would have been police who are securing the official residence.  I would not be made to sign any document in terms of indicating my presence in the official residence.  I would walk straight into the house.  As you get into the house you would turn right.  On the right side of the house that is where this meeting – themeeting that I had with Mr Mahlobo took place.  It is a lounge.  I think that lounge is basically meant for these meetings because every time I go there that would be the space we sit for discussions.That is what happened on that day when I was calledafter the journey.    So it must have been a week –     The residence is in – the residence is in Pretoria.    Next to Waterkloof.    Then whoever entered the house Mr Mahlobosaid to me hey Boetie – Boetie is brother I will talk in Zulu but I will translate.  (Speaking in vernacular).   Meaning he is going to connect me to is – to use a colloquial language Tsotsi’s.  These Tsotsi’s are judges.  So I was anxious that okay for a first time I would be able to talk to people of that calibre – judges.So after we had our own small talk the two gentlemen were ushered into the house.  There was a black guy and a white guy who looked a bit older.  I think he must have been in his 50’s – late 50’s and a black guy shorter Ithink not that – very tall.  He must be what 1.65 in terms of height.  So – and very dark without spectacles.  The white judge also did – or the person who was introduced as a judge – white judge did not have spectacles but the white guy was a bit nervous whereas the black person who wasintroduced as Mgwenya [?] Mr Mgwenya.I cannot remember the white judge’s name or the person who Mahlobo said is a judge – the white one as well as this guy – the black guy.  The black guy I remember because he said he is Mgwenya.   What made me to remember the name even now is because when you look at this person who was introduced as Mgwenya he does not look like a person who have come from KwaZulu Natal or Eastern Cape or Mpumalanga because Nguni people would have certain features as aSouth African I would be able to distinguish that.  But this person Mgwenya seems to be a person who may have come from Bushbuckridge or Limpopo Province.  That is why I could remember the surname.   But I was not convinced that this person is Mgwenya.  It must have been a code name given to me by Minister Mahlobo.  Then after…    Yes, yes it can be that if you broaden thetranslation Chairperson.    For me coming from a township as well if I say(speaking in vernacular) nickname mean it is my friend.    And they mean there is people that we do things together.    And are comfortable with them.    That is what I would think.    Yes, yes.    I would like to believe that the term was used in the context of what these two gentlemen were going to do for us because Mr Mahlobo said we are in trouble we would need to find a way to win this case against us in – on whattranspired in Cape Town as we are being challenged by SANAF.    So he then went on to say     I missed that.    Yes Chairperson.   (inaudible)    Yes, yes.    You can only use it to people that you are comfortable with.    Because a dog cannot be associated with a person.    So the context is correct.    No they would not.    They would not take offence.   I think the – it was more the collegial way than insulting them.    But my view was that the white (inaudible)    Yes.  No I was saying he – the white guys did not seem to be comfortable he was a bit jittery.    Whereas the black person Mgwenya was morerelaxed.    That is correct – that is correct.    On the phone he did not.  I only got to know when I was in the house.    That the purpose was really – the purpose was to discuss what transpired in Parliament and to deal with thelegal challenge because we needed to get this thing managed through the help of lawyers.  That is what I got to know when I was in the house.  But when I was still on the road I did not know why I was being called.    I enjoyed a very cordial relationship with Minister Mahlobo. 1. Because of the position that I occupied in my actingcapacity.  I was managing operational work of the agency meaning collection work.  I would not want to go into details.   And I would be requested from time to time to assist with operational work especially when there were challenges in the country. What comes to mind is that during the elections I think it was in 20 – local government elections there were problems in Tshwane and then we were asked to prepare a presentation to brief Lithulu House as to what was the problems  Were we going to have a safe – orsafer elections so I would prepare such presentations together with our analysis at headquarters.   Then he would then say he wants me to accompany him so that I can do the presentation.  So I would do those presentations of course there were – they would have beensanctioned by SSA.   On certain occasions he would say to me hey you must come to my house when I am in Parliament – in Cape Town.  When I get to the house I would not really why I am being invited to the house at such general talk things that are not even operational.   So that was the type of cordial relationship I had with the Minister Mahlobo.  On occasion when there would be something that he wants to be checked maybe there is somebody whose phone is being taken by a criminal hewould say hey Boetie can you assist to locate the phone?  Boetie is a brother.  He used to call me Boetie can you locate – help locate the phone because this phone is [indistinct – word cut] So I would then work with the service provider to assist us to check where the phone is and then – he would then use that information, maybe to ask the police to assist whoever might have lost the phone.  So, I would be working with Minister Mahlobo on some of those issues.     Yes, yes.  I came to know about them.  I would cite one example but there are many.  If the Commissioner allows me, I will go to two or three.  One.  We visited aplace called Eersterus.  The President was going to have to engage with the communities there because there were complaints or grievances from communities ...[intervenes]     One of the visits was...  Yes.     So when I got there – when the communities were complaining about the government not building themRDP Houses since they have been there.  There are no RDP Houses.Amongst other complaints, was that Eersterus is invested with drug dealing and they even knew the houses where drugs would be.  So the police were not doing anything about that.  So I sat next to Minister Mahlobo in a marquee.  He     [Indistinct] [Break in transmission]     Okay.  I spoke to Frank.  Then Frank laughed at  The third one.We were discussing ...[intervenes]    [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]     Yes.  Yes, Chairperson.     The third one, which I think those colleagues who were working with me as General Managers, meaningChief Directors because I was acting DG at that time.  There was another operation that was run by Mr Thulani Dlomo.  How we got to know about this operation is through a capacity that we have at HQ.  This capacity supports operations, light operations.  If we, for instance, conduct a surveillance operations, they will be able to say this number plat is wrong because they are linked to the ...[indistinct].  So they gave us the heads up that you are being investigated as a collective by Mr Thulani Dlomo.  And the name of thatoperation was called Project Greenleaf.  In the document that was shared with us as General Managers and myself and General Managers, there were names of people.  Our names as officials were there.  The name of the President was there.  The name of Mr Paul Mashatile was there, Minister of Basic Education, amongst others.  The list is endless.  There were also names of generals from the army, generals in the police.  We then confronted the DG, DG Kudjoe.  I think at that time, DG Kudjoe was supposedto be travelling outside the country.  We requested an urgent meeting.  She returned.  She cancelled the trip.  She came back to HQ because this was more like a revolt by senior members of the SSA.  We conveyed at her boardroom.  When weconvened, she called Minister Mahlobo that there is a problem here.  There is an operation that is directed at my officers, senior officers and we are raising serious     Thank you.  Thank you, advocate.     Yes.     Yes.     [Indistinct]...[intervenes]     The Eersterus one?  It was just before the localgovernment elections on ...[intervenes]     ...the first one – it was 2016, yes.  The second one is the Pelindaba.  That was around 2017 because soon after that, the former DG left, resigned from the agency.  Itwas in 2017.  It must have been around June 2017.  The – including the one, the Project Greenleaf was around 2017. ADV PRETORIUS     Around September I think.  September/October, there.     Yes.  The meeting was about the discussion following what transpired in Parliament and our role in respect to the equipment that was used there and the challenge by SANEF(?).  So the – during the discussion,     ...assisted by Sibo(?).     Yes.     It was.  It was a bit strange because – but I thought – because I have never been in a court of law where I would have to deal with these issues on my own other than when I appeared before the TRC.  That was a different matter.  Now on this one, I thought, because this judges are in Gauteng, maybe one of them would travel to Cape Town so that as I talk to these issues because my engagement with the senior counsel in Cape Town was totalk about the technicalities of this device.  What it can do, what it cannot do and why did we take the decision as – to place the device there.  So I had to explain all those things.  But to my surprise, when I was in Cape Town, I did not see the faces that I have met atMinister Mahlobo.  However, we won the first round in Cape Town.  The verdict favoured us.  There was one dissenting judge.  The matter was then referred to the appellate division.     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you, Advocate.  Maybe before I deal with that let me just correct the timelines.  What I spoke to I think it was in 2015, late 2015/2016.  Not 2017.     In terms of the – the three incidents that I was talking to.  They happened in 2015/2016, not ’17.     Yes, Sir.  What happened there, was we werediscussing there is the issue about jamming and how they would have to help given that the matter is not going to be in Gauteng, it will be in Cape Town.  The person who was introduced to me, this other guy, the white judge, seemed a bit uneasy whereas the black guy, Ngwenya, was saying no, no, no, they will do it, they will use their contracts in Cape Town and all these things but I did not know who those contacts were because in my mind I thought in one or the other we will see one of these guys called judges who are going to talk to us in Cape Town, but I did not seeeither of them, I only interacted with senior counsels.  There were two senior counsels in Cape Town.     And after...    Then after that I was released, I left Mr Mahlobo and the two gentlemen.  I left, I was released.     Well, I knew when Mahlobo told me when I was in the house.  I did not know beforehand as I was driving to the house that I was going to discuss judges.  [inaudible –speaking simultaneously]     No, no, I did not know them because I really did not pay attention to that seeing that they are not even people that ordinarily we would do business with.  We do not vet them.  If we were vetting judges, I would have known then.     In this instance I did not know them.     I would not be able to say I have seen them.  What happened is that in 2018, when Jafta was appointing Acting, he called me to his office to discuss this matter.  He then showed me photos of all the judges in the republic.  I was not able to say with certainty this is the person that I think I met in the house.  It is even worse with the white judge, I could not recall his basic features but the black judge was dark, without spectacles, shortish a bit, 1.65 in terms of his height.  That is all I could remember.      In any case, I did not think at the time when I was discussing this matter regarding the matter we were seized with in parliament that at some point I would be required to recall these faces because we are trained as spooks to memorise but in this instance I think I failed.     That is correct.     Yes, Sir, I am there.    That is correct.     Yes, in terms of that paragraph, yes, Director Langa, when he came to join the SSA I was already acting in the position of a DDG, meaning that I was the only person that he could rely on as he was appointed, recently appointed.  So for a number of days that would haverequired him to deal with alone he would call me and say I am new here, tell me how do I manage this one, how do I deal with this issue?  He had been presented with a green form, I think the Commission has heard a number of witnesses talking about the green form so he was given a green form.  This green form was requiring him to sign for an amount of 12 million.  He then asked me whether he must sign.  I said no, you cannot sign, ask for a document that details as to what is this thing that you are paying for, that document must say this is a project, if it is a project orif it is an asset, this is an asset, this is what the asset is doing and it warrants that type of a payment but ordinarily we do not pay such amounts of money as an organisation.  It was an anomaly in my view so said no, be extra careful, do not do it.  He then went on – I think on leave or trip, Iwas acting in his position.  So I acted twice.  This 12 million requisition came to me that I must sign, I refused.  I said I am not signing …[intervenes]     Thank you, thank you.     So this 12 million, then the requisition came to me, I refused to sign because the incumbent was notaround.  I waited for him to come, I submitted this thing, the requisition of 12 million.  I think he succumbed to pressure, he signed for this 12 million.  After signing this 12 million he then said to me, you know, I saw this money being loaded in paper bags by Frank and he took it to theformer Minister.  After that he was worried.  I said to him do not sign anything that involves such huge amounts of money.     Yes, yes, I did, I did.     But I think even numbers that I spoke to him, all he could say is that Minister Mahlobo took 4 million out of this for his project, the rest I think Frank managed, I do notknow what they did about it.     Yes.     No, no, it is correct, it is correct, it is not because it is not correct, I thought it is a given that Frank took money and I also spoke to Frank in my capacity that I would not [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     To Mahlobo, two paper backs. ADV PRETORIUS     According to Frank.     Yes, I was told by my former boss.     It must be around 2016, early 2016.     That is correct, Sir.      Well, I am not surprised because from what I have seen from the Commission is that it has become anormal to deny everything, so I would not be surprised.     That Dorothy would deny it.     Yes, I do.     That is correct, Sir.     Yes, I did, I did attend this meeting.     No, I will not.     Yes.     The instruction was that there is a problem andthis person must be paid because if we do not pay this person the former President’s involvement in this project would have been exposed and the issue was that the asset had even taped that meeting so there was proof that this meeting – that involved the former President did actually take place.  So the issue was that in order for this person not to go to court he must be paid the amount of money to silence him.     Minister Mahlobo then said...    Oh, okay.     No, no, sorry, I am mixing the two, I thought we were now on the issue of the other one. ADV PRETORIUS     This one is true, the person …[intervenes]     Okay, yes, because I was dealing with paragraph 54 instead of paragraph 53.    But let me first say on 53 it is correct, this thing that is – the paragraph, that is on 53, is correct.  I paid this person 120 000 every month for his protection but I became concerned because we are audited, serious audited by internal audit, by the IG and the AG.  I then asked what am I going to say when the auditors are coming to me to ask about these amounts of money that I am paying because I do not have any record except the details of this person and the signature where he signs for theseamounts.  Then I then said can I do some checks if this person indeed his life is under threat?  He agreed.  I then did what we call counter-surveillance.  It is not following the person but it is to check whether this person that we are giving money is being followed by others.  There wasnothing.  This person would drive to a mall, stay in his house, no problem.  So I then report to Mr Mahlobo that I am not going to be able to continue paying because from what I got as a report from my colleagues who did the task, there is no problem here, so I stopped, but after having paid what Mr Mahlobo said I should do.  In any case, I reported these issues to my former DG.      Chairperson, I am sure I can get those – I am sure I can – but it was not once, it was a number of times but I am sure I can get those records.     At this meeting - I think I spoke to some of the issues earlier on that it is a project that was run by Special Ops and it had gone wrong because this asset starteddemanding huge amounts of money and if they were not prepared to pay those amounts of money, he threatened to go to court and expose the operation but also to expose the fact that at some point he was personally sitting in a meeting involving the former President to discuss thismatter.  So the issue was that – from Mr Mahlobo, manage this issue so that it does not go to court, pay this person.  My problem with that was that but why executive members playing a role in operations because if you plan an operation you also plan how you are going to wind it down.  So this was a classical example of an operation that is poorly planned.  He said I must pay this person 6 million.  I said I cannot pay this 6 million because your MPDs do not allow me to do this thing, I cannot pay for that amount, I have no authority to pay such a lot of money.  I refused incarrying his instruction but I was subsequently informed that this person, asset was paid some monies, huge amounts of monies.     They are correct, Sir.      September 2016 we were called to the Minister’s office, all senior members of the agency were called then, especially the domestic side but there were some from foreign side.  We were then introduced to thenew DG, Mr Arthur Fraser, that this was going to be our new DG.  Then Mr Arthur Fraser immediately embarked on a process which he termed realignment process.  That realignment process he also said he has got a vision or a vision was developed for 2035.   Immediately when that process of coming up with a vision was being developed, an organogram was also being created that talks to this vision.  The first people to be victims of this vision, 2035, was the Director Domestic Branch because the Director Foreign Branch had alreadyindicated that he was leaving the agency.  I think the reasons are better known to him but he was uncomfortable with the arrangement especially following the appointment of Mr Fraser. Then the Director Domestic Branch was removed from his position through an organogram that you can see when it was presented that you do not have a box anymore in the Domestic Branch, so eventually he was forced to leave.       He kept on coming to work, he kept on coming to work.     To who?    To me?  I will come to that.     I want to give a picture so that the Commission must see what really happened there.     Then the director is moved, his office is flooded  – one day he gets to his office, the whole office is flooded with water, he cannot come in.  He then calls me to say hey man, come and see my office is flooded, the wholecarpet is soaked.  We then check whether maybe the problem with the bathroom because their offices have bathrooms.  There was no sign of any leakage of water from the bathroom.  So clearly somebody came to put water into his office.  Then he said to me it means I am no longer wanted here, I must work from home.  That was the last time he sat, it is for HQ.Following that, the next person that was to be removed was myself after worked in that position of acting for two and a half years.  This happens within a period of aweek.  The second week, all these are happening that I am just explaining.   Then as this project begins to take shape, all general managers are told that he is going to work with those general managers who are fit for purpose but hedoes not explain what the purpose is, there is no study that is conducted to say if you fail to do the following you are not fit for this particular purpose.   He then appoints junior members who are three levels below our levels to occupy our offices.  In my case I was left even without an office, I had to come to HQ for a period of two and a half years without being given any work, being called or telephoned.  Others were told that they would be advisers and that position does not exist in the agency, it never existed, it only existed in the officesof the ministers and that position of advisers is regulated by ministerial directives. In my case I questioned that are you chancing my conditions of service because I do not know what you are talking about, I have been here since ’95, we never had this thing.  So I was then left in the cold for two years whilst getting my salary, getting a bonus, my cell phone was fully paid for, everything that you can think of which comes as perks and this applied to all other GMS, general managers, during Mr Fraser’s reign.This project that he had was never even approved by JSCI and yet it was implemented and whilst it was implemented, certain DDGs were appointed under the auspices of this project which was not sanctioned by JSCI.  We kept on asking where is the approval of this thing thathas been implemented?  There was nothing.  Thank you, Advocate.     In April 2018 Mr Fraser then gets moved to Correctional Services and then – no, no, I think it was in March when we got to know that he was being moved.  Then I was called to come back but not to Domestic Branch, to go Foreign site by …[intervenes]     Thank you, Advocate, maybe let me explain or give a definition of what we understand as peddlers or a peddler or peddling.A peddler is somebody who purposefully gives wrong information about something.  Letme make an example.  At some point there was an information that SSA or NIA then had to deal with.  The information was coming from some person in Mpumalanga who said the current President and Mr Tokyo Sexwale were planning – I think even [indistinct], they were planning a coup against the administration of President Mbeki.  We worked on that only to find out there is nothing like that but that information can only be confirmed by him alone, no other source could confirm that information.  So a peddler is somebody who cooks information but the objective is toget money but also to sow confusion.  A peddler would not be in the agency as I know it, as a person who would be working in this organisation since ’95.  Even in my previous years as a member of the Intelligence of the ANC we knew peddlers to be people who are outside our ranks who wouldcome to us to sow confusion.  That is how I understand the definition of a peddler, but if Minister Mahlobo was saying members of the Agency can at times be surrounded by peddlers maybe that would make sense, but in my case I would not be surrounded by pedlars, because the position I occupy in the organisation does not allow me to handle sources.  I only deal with the directing of the work that needs to be done, at the time when I was doing operational work.That is the understanding I have, so to call me apedlar would be something that is frowned upon in the profession and the pedlar we classify them, work on them and we blacklist them, we don’t want to do anything with pedlars, in fact they are a nightmare to any intelligence officer because you then follow the shadows based on what they give you as alert.   I think I alluded to something earlier on about…[indistinct], that was a pedlar who gave us that information because we could not confirm it but there is no pedlar inside the …[indistinct], there is nothing, thank you.    I would not lie about the Minister and in my history of working in this environment, firstly, in the movement, I never was a liar. In the history of the Intelligence since 1995, I worked in various capacities there has never been an accusation directed at me that I’m a liar. I have briefed senior people in the country, including presidents, give them briefings.  I have briefed Parliament even with the current Minister on several occasions.  Whywould I target Minister Mahlobo only on this one of the Judges and it confirms the other issues in terms of these projects that he instructed me to…[indistinct] he does not have a problem with that, I’m not a pedlar when I talk about that.  I only become a pedlar when I talk about the Judges.  Well, my guess would be as good as the guess of those members of the pubic who are watching the proceedings, thank you.     I know that is plausible enough for a person of Minister Mahlobo’s calibre to say, I’m a faction.  I am not a card carrying member of any political organisation.  Yes, in the past I used to be a member of the ANC but when we amalgamated in 1995 Minister Nklantla said he does not think it’s a good idea that we must be card carrying members because we are not going to be impartial.  So, from then on, I never took part in any political work of the ANC.  So, why would be a faction because factions wouldonly exist in a political organisation.  In the agents there are lots of possible as new Ministers gets appointed those people who…[indistinct] who seek to be promoted because in a situation that we have, where – especially during Minister Mahlobo’s time, there was no one who was appointed to a permanent position.  Even if you were appointed when it came you were told that you are now acting in your own substantive position.  So, that situation created a state of flux where people were not sure and it then brings this behaviour where people will then go anddrink tea about people’s  name.  In my case, I am not a member of any faction.  Yes, there are a lot of issues in the agents, a moral issue, appointments that are not done correctly in some instances without adhering to the policies and that breeds contempt amongst members but that doesnot make one to be a faction and if you raise issues that are correct and you raise them on the basis of policies and principle and regulations then you are classified as a faction.  Maybe that is what he meant, but I’m not a faction, thank you.     If I knew I would have said it to the Commission.  I’ve said, since 1995 I’ve worked in various capacities in the agents, domestic, foreign even abroad, I’ve never been investigated, even now as I’m sitting here, I’ve never been investigated, nothing.  Now to be told that, hey, there’s a suspicion about you, that you have done the following thing, never.  I was hearing it for the first time yesterday on TV.     Nothing at all, nothing not even under Mr Fraser, nothing.     Thank you Chairperson.     Chairperson,  may I say something, if I’m allowed?    Chairperson, I would want the Commission to seriously, as they conclude this process, that this agency can only work if the President exercise his prerogative to take political control of the agency because in my 26 years of being part of this agency, Ministers who get appointed, they come with their political agenda and they cause a lot of problems in the agency.     And I don’t think that is helpful for thetaxpayers who are paying us the salaries to do nothing to protect them as well as the Constitution.  So, my view and my appeal is that maybe we must not have a Minister for some time until all our problems are sorted but the high level panel recommendations have never beenimplemented, this is the third year I guess and nothing has moved in that regard and if there is a process that process does not involve members or senior members of the organisation, if it exists somehow.     Those things, I think, they need to be done to ensure that we are back to our glory days, thank you Chairperson. 
COUNSEL:   Chair?     Sorry.  Good morning again.     As you will know that I present the witness, Mr Mahlobo and the other witness...  Chair, I listened to this evidence and I would choose or from the witness tosay he is using examples.  And I must place it on record that whatever examples in his testimony so far to these transactions and whatever, not contained anywhere in the documents including his affidavit.     Thank you.     And just for the record.  We are hearing for the first time.  So let me ...[intervenes]     ...we all follow and ...[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.  Sorry, before my learned colleague proceeds, Chair if you have, obviously, the document or the affidavit deposed by this witness and we’ve agreed that there was some elaborations. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Taking cue of that, there were considerations last night.     That we will be furnished withquestions from the Chair, I would want to think that will also form part of this questionnaire and will be sent to us, this elaboration by this witness.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair, thank you to my colleague. 
FRANK:  Very good afternoon, I am present.  Thank you so much.      Good afternoon Chair.    Thank you very much Chairperson.    Thank you.    Let me just compare that.  YY16, yes I do have.    Let me check.  You are saying yes on 1116.    And page?    Oh 1146.  Okay hold on we will get it there justnow.  Definitely I am there sir.    [Indistinct], yes it is.    46.  1146?    1146.34 né.    No, I am getting there.  1146.34.  Definitely, yes.    I recall definitely.    Yes sir.    Hold on sir, do not – you are saying YY?    Okay page?    [Indistinct], same mark you gave me?    Oh okay.    800 …    836.  Hold on for me quick.  836.  836.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    841.  Yes sir, I recognise that.    Yes.  Yes.    Are you making ...[indistinct]), are you making ...[indistinct] turn the page?    Yes sir.    May confirm that I have been interviewed on that day, however I also want to place it on record that this transcript before me I saw it for the first time a year after when served to me by the Commission.  So it was never shared to me as an affected party by the investigators. Only to say or suffice to say I see this transcript for the first time as provided by the Commission.    Yes.  Yes.  Yes.    Yes sir.    [Indistinct], can you repeat that for me sir?    Yes.    Yes, I see.    Project Construção.    In reference to this page were Dudu Myeni and Colin Maynier, Maynier.   He was the president of the ANC youth league.    Yes.    Still on this page.  Yes.    And the deputy, the deputy president.  The thendeputy president Desmond Muela.     Yes.    Can you read?  Where does that follow?    Yes I can see that.  I can see that.    Yes.   I see that.  [Indistinct].    It is correct.  Correct.    No, I am trying to look at it, specifically, what?  Where?  Yes sir.   Can I, can I clarify?    I think there is a, there is a misconstrued ideahere.  Co-workers did not fall under ...[indistinct] Project Mr ...[indistinct].  Co-workers was another, it was a team of other employees operative within the EDSO.  It did not fall within my spec, my …    Yes I do.      Alright then.   Co-workers was a set of other employees attached to CDS chief directorate.  Special operations, but they did not fall within my area of work.  So that part of the transcript it’s not correct.    Yes.  Yes it might have been misunderstood.  The co-worker specifically part of it.     Let me have a look at it quickly.  I am not sure the construction of the word of the paragraph as it ends, they come from a foreign country.  I am not sure what itwas meant there.  But I remember that part of the discussion.    Yes we had a discussion around that.    Where is that sir?  Can you direct me please?   No.    It’s misconstrued here.      I mean …    No, I did not say.  Let me leave it at that.    I am not suggesting that.  I was, I was actually saying the wording there, it might have been but as far as my recollection is concerned.      No, no, no.      Not at all Chair. Not ...[indistinct] if you say, if you say they came from a foreign country, the insinuation was that these were not South African citizens.      The discussion there was making reference to say they were trained outside a foreign country.  That was the discussion, as far as I can recall.    Yes.    Yes.    Exactly that.    Exactly Chairperson.    [Indistinct].   Yes.  So there is an omission.    So there is an omission there.   Ja.    Chair, in the same context that I was trying to correct there, that that paragraph with the foreign country, I want to make reference even to this paragraph there.  The discussion was to say there were also relatives of Thulani.     Yes, they were.  So ...[indistinct] I do not know, but I say there were.    Chairperson can you repeat yourself?    Yes.    I am not there Chairperson, but …    But ...[indistinct] it would be, it would – let me say I am not sure what does the name but …    To me it will be misleading information.    Yes sir.    I may not remember the exact wording but I remember it could have fallen(?) amongst the things that we had discussed in that particular interview.    Let me put it clearly, that is why I am saying some of the words do – I just put it on paper, the conceptualising, conceptualising of it, it was as per theestimate at the time and in a brief discussion which I was also present with other members.  Was given to me and then I was asked to put the whole thing into pen, pen and paper.    I may not be able to give a exactly detail, the exact detail of the project, but it was one of the counter intelligence measures that were, were meant to be put in place.  Specifically or initially to assist in counter – intelligence operations ...[indistinct] of the country.    [Indistinct].    Yes sir, I am there.    There was a discussion definitely yes.    Chairperson can I put it on record, that at that particular time or at that particular phase of the project I was not involved there, so I will not know.    Yes.    I could say it would have taken place.  However I need to put it to context.  [Indistinct] writing that.  It says the minister.  And I had not, at no given stage in my...[indistinct] to the minister.  I think the reference was made to the ministry.  I think I need to put that on record.    The minister could be the person himself.  The ministry could be an office in which we were dealing with officials in that office.      [Indistinct] perhaps elaborate.  Sorry.      Perhaps at a later stage you clarify that entire thing with that office.      Yes.   Ministry, yes that is correct.    I am telling them the truth, correct sir.     Yes, yes sir.     I am saying in as far as I am concerned the monies that I was taking through to ministry was delivered by an official.  I have never taken money personally to Minister Mahlaba.   I am talking in relation to me, myself.     Correct.     Yes, correct.     To the officials referred to in my affidavit, J andB.     No, no, I’m not sure how it is written in these documents…[indistinct].     In the Ministry.     Yes, correct Chairperson.     Yes, one of those was a member – I mean, was yes because he’s no longer – was a member of SSA and …[indistinct] operative yes.     Yes.     Was an official in the office.     Yes.     [Inaudible audio distorted].     I may not be able to disclose that, but he was a member of SSA but not an operative.    Yes.     Chairperson, in this context, yes because we are making reference to operations so try distinguish what’s that.  One had capacity to be involved in operations, one did not have.     No, it’s not right Chairperson.     What is right in terms of …[inaudible – audio distorted] particular persons and trying to distinguish in relation to capacity of what would be, one with the capacity or two can be participating…[indistinct], would not be able to have a …[indistinct] member because any person that is an employee and there’s an issue with the appointment…[indistinct] is therefore, a member.     Have an appointment number, yes.     Of which I don’t know any of – any of such person.[Indistinct] establishment is a …[indistinct] regardless of his particular position or casting.     So, you’d not be in that…[inaudible – audio distorted] not a member.     Yes, whether at the Ministry or at OTC, unless you’re a member.     Within those two establishments I’m referring to.     Because there could be people who were part of the agents who are not…[indistinct] that is something else outside those two establishments I’m making reference to.     Yes.     Chairperson that discussion took place, however, I need to put certain things into context because I think the describer omitted that context part.  This taking over by the Ministry was…[indistinct] saying after facing some challenges in this operation …[indistinct] intervention  bythe Minister in which the Minister himself, then tasked these two officials to …[indistinct] with operatives how best can these be dealt with and one of the agreed propositions with the officials was that the withdrawal of this money needs to be confirmed either in the office delivered tothem.  They would then arrange a …[indistinct] and upon that – and upon return from it would then receive certificate with a signature of the subject, which we had in our disposal as, what do you call, as an example, so we knew exactly how the subject would sign upon receiving this money and I would then collect that certificate for settling the…[indistinct], but I want, also to correct something,  Chairperson.     It talks here about money that started atR1.3million…[indistinct] Ops Justice and that money went up to R21.8million, that’s an incorrect affirmation of the statement.     The operation, when it started, it was allocated R1.3million and then at a later stage the operation was allocated R1.8million to …[indistinct] for the operation.  So, that R21.8million, it’s wrong information…[intervenes].     R1.3million to R1.8million.    Not R21million I don’t know anything about R21million, I’ve never drawn…[indistinct] of me ever drawing that R21million.     Definitely it was recorded but…[indistinct].     [Inaudible – audio distorted].     Yes, but I’m saying what part of  that 904?     Oh, okay.     Okay.     Hold on, hold on, where are we?     Okay…[indistinct].     Sir can I confirm that we had a discussion of that nature, however, the construction of that paragraph, …[indistinct] the end, has been taken out of context.  Perhaps I need to explain one thing sir, my involvement with this project or…[indistinct], was merely because therewere challenges…[indistinct] the Minister request me to conduct an investigation, together with some officials from the Department of Correctional Services and report back with my findings.  So, this issue discussed here, it refers to that investigation in which, according to these officials, according to these officials there indicated the reason why the subject was placed under the care of SSA Special Ops, it was because he was helpful in conducting or revealing some information which was not revealed even through the GRC or any other form for which did help the President insome decisions that he had to make and that they, themselves did a discussion with the President in that matter, it’s not my discussion with the President.  It’s a discussion with…[indistinct] the officials of Correctional Service and their understanding, that was the reason why the subject was placed under our care.  So, I wanted to clear – and …[indistinct] it was not in accordance to words told to me by the Minister it’s in accordance to information of the officials when I interacted with them.  So, I could not – I  don’t have the proof of that particular …[indistinct].    Good afternoon.     905?    I am on page 905, sir.     Yes, remember in the context that I have alluded to with that correction of the Ministry.     Not Minister, yes.     Yes, yes, yes, yes.     Yes, they were.  Remember, they were part ofthe team that was asked to resolution – to rectify the actual [indistinct] that existed... [intervenes]     Yes, I am talking – remember, all those projects that are there or those operations, not projects, are as a result of the ministerial intervention.     So the money is combined for all ops, ja.     I can confirm.     May I correct something, Chair.     There was never a project.  There was an operation.     Yes, that there was that conversation in andaround these operations and the officials would facilitate that transactions [indistinct] distributions.     Chair.     Yes, I can.     Yes.  Remember a project, Chair, a project is established based on the national intelligence estimates which [indistinct] that is put forth.  There is a [indistinct] of the planning, the costing and all those things, né... [intervenes]    ...that results in the project with the [indistinct] and with a person who is allocated to run that particular project.     Now with the preparation if there is anything that arises within the context of evidence that needs to be taken care of, remember part of our work, every information that comes to us is valuable, as a result of such part of it is that we need to put counter-intelligencemeasures in place to confirm or refute the existence of that particular threat.  So this operation comes in the midst – in the middle of the project running, so we then accommodate within a particular project.     The operation arises because of a particular [indistinct].     Operations, exactly.  Exactly, Chair.     Because of the cost factors, né, we look at the relevant projects that can be related to that particularthreat.  So I would [indistinct] within that context of a project [indistinct] which had its own purpose, then a local or a threat that arises it was well best to place it within that particular project.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.     Chairperson, it seems going forward in that particular statement it was a mixture of two factual issues looking at the figure that follows there.  That particular issue deal with [indistinct] Operation Justice.     Yes, we did have a conversation around that Project... [intervenes]    No, although it is not put into context, but it is in line with what I have explained around Operation Justice.  I then meant to investigate, confirm or refute, yes. ADV PRETORIUS     So it is not well explained there.     Yes, I am saying in that particular paragraph there is a reference of issues instead of putting into context what issue, what it was.     [Indistinct 00    Okay, sir.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Chairperson, that conversation took place.     Made available [indistinct] ... [intervenes]     No, no, no.     No, no, no, I am well placed, Chairperson.  I am well placed.  I am [indistinct].     It is just a technical – it is a technical issue.     Yes.  I wanted to confirm, but again I want to correct the [indistinct] because there is reference of the Minister and then the Minister again, so I want to put those things into context. Firstly, remember we said these are ministerial intervention projects which then forced that all theseparticular monies and operations need to be coordinated with the officials in the office of the Minister.  So that 2.5 fall squarely within those operations that are identified to the need to be there.   Now, there would be instances where there would be a complaint to the Minister.  I do not know by whoever it is related to the project, because I am not privy to the project to say we have made the delivery late or not yet.  So I would explain to the Minister, no, we have not done the monthly withdrawal of funds with respect to all theother operations inclusive of our own which are not necessarily the ones within the Ministry for intervention. So that paragraph there, it needed to establish and put that into context so it is understood that that call was not specifically because there was only people that theMinister – no, no, no.  The Ministry would call to say we are aware that there is this intervention in these particular operations and we have received a complaint, this has not taken place, what has happened.  Then I would explain that.     No, no, no, no.  I am saying it is correct to say the Minister did call.  Remember he is part of the people that is receiving this [indistinct] intervening, so he would call me to say what is happening because [indistinct] intervene in this matter.     So what is happening.  I am hearing that you have not complied or you have not delivered this particular operation and I would explain the reason to say but,Minister, we have not done our monthly withdrawals or we still face the challenge of funds or we are still waiting, whatever the case.     He knew about the intervention by the Ministry and that it took [indistinct] officials for that.  So he made to be understand by whoever was the recipient that that particular operation has not taken place.  So that is what he meant there.     Yes, sir.    Ja, let me put it on record, sir, that Commitment it is what was referred to because we were not privy to the operation.  Nobody wanted to what you call [indistinct] the purpose, so we would always make that reference as the Commitment, but remember there is this part of thecommitment of monies that needs to go out.  So it was not in relation to 2.5.  It was in relation to all the commitments that we placed as part of [indistinct].     That [indistinct] the point, Chairperson.     Yes, sir.     If I can also put that into context.  I think it was the writing that you are not understanding.  When we heardabout these other commitments to operations that we were not informed, there was also reference – there was always reference that, you know, some of these operations would be looked at at the presidential level.  So there was no direct reference to say it was for the formal projects.  There were projects looked at at the presidential level.  That is my understanding.     No, it was the presidential project – presidentiallevel, sorry.     I do not know.     At the presidential – no, no, no.  At the presidential level.     I used presidential level that these 2.5 had to do with anything at the presidential level.     I would not know.  That is why I am saying it issomething [indistinct].  I do not know anything about it.     Yes, that is what I heard around.  Remember this was [indistinct] as operatives, as [indistinct] if someone else would have to do – to deliver that money, because I was not the only one delivering.  My understanding at the level of operations and our operatives, that was the understanding that there is a presidential level.  As to what is that presidential level a need-to-know principle applied. I had never asked about it.     Yes, sir.    The conversation took place and that reference of 20 million it was a reference of allocation.  The first allocation of the project was 20 million, not withdrawn. And then later the project was further allocated 30 million.     What irregular?     What is that was irregular?  I do not follow.     Yes, it was allocation.     Allocation, yes.  And later 30 million.     Allocation, yes.     Okay, what it meant here is that remember when these projects [indistinct] personnel had to be [indistinct] to this project, which means Project Wave was going to be utilised in conjunction with personnel recruited specifically to deal with that operation or that project.So when an approval took place in January 2015 or in November 2014, somewhere there, I am not really sure, personnel had not been recruited as yet.  However, because of the pressing need to carry out the operation money was utilised in that process, you know, without this particular personnel.  So the personnel came into being almost, you know, towards the middle of the project already.  So other personnel within other assets were utilised for the implementation of the project.     I was just... [intervenes]     I was making a... [intervenes]     Yes, sir.     I can see that.  Yes, I can see that.     Yes, it did... [intervention]     Again, I know we have discussed about theexcess money, the issue of excess money.  I am not quite sure – conversant with the direction in which the money was taken.  I know we spoke about was there a possibility that you guys would draw extra money and then I made a reference that I [indistinct] which money was sent to us in the office and it was in excess of 20 000 which were refunded back to the office.     I know I had that discussion, but going forward I am not [indistinct].    Yes, that is why I am saying I am not sure about that, but I know we had a conversation of extra funds – withdrawals from funds, yes.     Specifically that, yes.  Yes.     Yes.     Will confirm, sir.  Will confirm, sir.     Can you repeat for me, sir?     933, you said.     933.  Yes, sir.     Yes, I was.     One?     950.    I have got up to 945.     Yes, I think we did.     Can you repeat for me, sir?     975.     975.  Yes, sir.     Yes, we did discuss with the panel.  I did discuss with them.     1010.    Hold on, sir.  Hold on, sir.  I am at 1010.     I can confirm it took place, sir.     It is correct, sir.     Yes, sir.  Yes.     Conversation took place, Chair.    Yes, I would say also... [intervenes]     Suffice to say I can assume now that it is making reference to the issue of the 2.5 million that we spoke about – I mean, the Operation Justice that we spoke about in last transcript.     No, no, no, I did not know much about it.  I just made speculation of investigation of the judges, because I did not have in depth of that project [indistinct], you know.  I only know that there was this assumption – not assumption or that information that reflected a threat, youknow, by judges colluding with foreign intelligences within the justice system.  Therefore there was a need to confirm or refute that information by form of investigation.     Yes, remember I was making reference to that 1.3 and then 1.8.     No, these monies were paid to deal with set of judges suspected of being involved in actual fact.     Were paid to deal with a set of judges suspected of being involved in this particular threat.     Not set of judges.     Set of judges – monies were paid to deal with a set of judges, yes.  Not paid to the set of judges.    Because I would not have the information.     Set of judges, yes.     No, I would not because I do not have thatevidence.  I do not even know.     Okay.     Ja, Chair, it could be that you choose to understand that way, however in my context this set of judges that were suspected [indistinct] is because theseare a set of judges that are working on high profile cases that foreign intelligence seeks to influence.  That is my understanding.     Yes, I can confirm it did.  I was making reference to JMZ.     [Indistinct 00    1036.  Yes, sir.     That is correct.    Yes, sir.     Yes, sir.  Correct, sir.     I wrote it personally, sir.     Yes.     Yes, sir.     Yes, sir.     Correct, sir.     Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.     Paragraph 8. ADV PRETORIUS     Which page is this?    Yes, sir. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes, yes.     Yes, this is correct, sir.    That is correct, sir.     That is correct to my knowledge, sir.    114?     Can you repeat for me, sir?     Yes, sir.     Yes, sir, that is correct.     Yes, sir.    Sir, I will have preferred if you did not mention the name there, suffice to say... [intervenes]     [Indistinct 00    Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I think one of those, yes, that would have been correct.    I can confirm, sir.     They are correct, sir.     Yes, sir.     That is correct, yes.     Sir, I think that will have to be limited to that,given that they actually copied a version of that needs and better explain [indistinct].     Yes.     Yes. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes.    Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct, which is nothing out of thenormal.     Can I – sorry, sir.  Chair?    Can I draw you back to the issue raised by Mr... [intervenes]     Yes, yes, with relation to my wife.  I am not sure there, but that the [indistinct] was made that the company that [indistinct] it was registered under her name, that is why it is not her involvement.  It is not involvement.  I think ...[intervenes]    Oh yes very very correct.  It was not (inaudible)    And that played 00   Yes.    Yes, yes Sir.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.  Yes Sir.   Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct. Yes Sir.   Yes.    Correct Sir. ADV PRETORIUS    Well described.  That is correct.   That is correct.  That is correct Sir.    Certainly it is correct Sir.    That is correct Sir.    Repeat the sentence.    Can you repeat that for me?    Sir I do mention all the elements or components which comprised that (inaudible) which includes not only toxicology but also the technical compass and the legislature.    Yes it is all there.    Yes.  6.2 yes.    62.1 Sir – Chair.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct Sir.   That is correct Sir.    That is correct Sir.    Yes Sir.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes Sir.   Yes.    Yes.  I have got it.    3 page?    378?    Did you say 378?    Yes.  Yes.   Yes.    Yes.      Okay.    Which page is that Sir?    Yes I am on it.   Yes that is correct now.    Yes.    Yes.    It is mine.    15.    Yes. Can I explain.    As to you so that we can (inaudible)    I collected the money from the headquarters to our remote office which I made Lilly to sign that she has – shehas received what she had asked me to collect.  And in turn she has delivered the money to the ended recipient.  So that signature at the bottom it is of the ended recipient.  I made her sign and then she makes the other recipient sign.  When she sign I keep a copy then finally she makes them then sign and she give back to me and I take this one for a settlement.    (Inaudible)l.   So giving her to sign it was also to safeguard self. I have delivered the money to her before she delivers.  Anything that can happen in between her trying to deliver the money to the actual intended recipient I am covered thatI had given it to her.    I would not know.    I would not know.  Not in this particular context I do not know.    You see (inaudible) 00   Yes but that is what we have been saying consistently.    Yes.   From the original bundle.    Yes.    Okay.      M14.    Okay.      Okay alright.  Yes.    449.    449.  Yes Sir.   Okay.    I see that.    Yes.    That is correct.  That is correct.   Yes it is mine yes.    16 that is correct.  That is correct.    Ja.   Look I do not want to speculate I am not sure that is our view but it is definitely not – I am not sure.    That is correct.    Okay.    Correct.    I am there.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair may I ask we take five minutes to run to the bathroom while that is being sorted out.    Thank you.     Good afternoon, sir.  Good afternoon, Chair.     Yes, I am there.     Yes.     Yes, sir.  463.    I see that, sir.     No, I did not have at all.     Yes, I think I was answering to the column with no difficulty.       Yes.    Yes.     Yes.     The last one?     The last one works at that facility, remember?     No, no, no.  The last one.  Are you referring the one on page 1146.28?     ...seven.    Yes, I see that.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Can you repeat for me, what page is that?    Yes?  Okay.     Yes.     No, not at this juncture.  It is fine.    That is correct, sir.     Chair?     I am not sure but, you know, from the beginning of this exercise ...[intervenes]  ...I thought perhaps I will find space ...[intervenes]     ...to, you know, at – to say something to you, Chair.    And this one, Chair, is ...[intervenes]     The first one is just to make an indication that me being here, it is in response, not only to the request made by the then acting DG, my being here, also, it was also motivated, myself consciousness and willingness to assist the Commission with this furthering of evidence.     However, also within my own context that Ithought, you know, this exercise in the end would have been able to dispel some of the things that, you know, were presented by some witnesses to the Commissions to which they have made or that built(?) to the fact that, you know, we operated, you know, as we believe, you know,without control, without discipline(?) and so forth.     However, I know this is a matter that can be dealt with perhaps in the correspondence forum(?), but I want to put it on record sir, that my understanding and my view of things is that we only did the most(?) things(?)  on narratives as provided for in the investigation.But that also we acknowledge that there might be areas in which we might have acted or done things wrong or perhaps we could have done it better or in abetter way ...[intervenes]     ...but we did not do.     Is the notion that suggests that we deliberately created empowerments(?) in which we tend to mislead or categorically(?)  we walked(?) in the wrong boots. [Speaker not clear – transmission not clear]     The brisket(?) in terms of the legislation, thedirectives that we must not – that empower us in whatever we are doing.  Some witnesses may even said things that in our view(?) there were no reports, that were no need(?) in the planning.  [Speaker not clear – transmission not clear]    In this particular(?) witnesses, they are not familiar with operations like that.     [Break in transmission – speaker unclear]  Even in covert operations, if product assets are custodian(?) ...[indistinct] reports inclusive.     So, this – not have received reports.  Witnesses may not have seen the need.    Witnesses may not have seen whatever they referred to but that is not suggesting that these things were not there.      These things were there.  [Indistinct] [00    I am not saying this because some of us still have a career within the industry(?).  We would love to continue to this country going forward.     So, place that on record because I do not wantanything that is to suggest we are here because we are guilty, as said to be by some of the witnesses.     Might be the point maybe some witnesses that even without evidence of things even without making reference to legislature but confidently stood and say to the Chair that this particular animal did conform to the regulations of the states.  So, perhaps, as we go on, Chair, we will find a way of assisting the Commission further to understand that this was done within the ambit of, youknow, serving our country.     Thank you very much.     Ja, I think you have said it well.  I would prefer to actually dispose to a kind of an affidavit which you know can be used and by the omission going forward ...[intervenes]     ...without me having to come back.     Or even if you want to something of – without me having to come back.    Yes.     I will prefer(?) to dispose that. I will definitely dispose to an affidavit, Chairperson.     Yes.     Thank you very much Chairperson. 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
UNKNOWN MALE:   Chair, I think there is a technical glitch.  I do not think my learned colleague understood.  It looks like there is a break in the technical.  The witness was still proceeding [indistinct].
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Good afternoon, DCJ.     Yes, we are.     Yes, the representation is the same as before.    Yes, thank you.  Chairperson, Ms Gigaba’s exhibit is Exhibit 26.  I understand you have it in front of you.  I am going to start by taking her to a supplementary/clarification affidavit that she recently filed.  I assume you would want the ...[intervenes]     ...the oath to be administered?     Yes.  Chairperson, you will recall that we had a marathon session that went on, I think it was until half-past eleven on one evening with Ms Gigaba.     Ms Gigaba did indicate, in the course of her evidence, that there were certain things that she was unhappy about.  The content of the affidavit and other things.    It was always envisaged that she would put in that affidavit and that we would then have to deal with it.     So that is one leg of sitting this evening. The other leg and I suppose it must follow after we have dealt with the supplementary affidavit and any corrections that she wants to make, we need then to put Mr Gigaba’s version to her for her comment.     So those are the purpose of this evening’s session.     So, DCJ, sorry.  I have just been advised that the oath has not been recorded because the witness spoke too softly.     I – there were some things that were discussed.  I am not aware of exactly what correction ...[intervenes]     ...my learned friend had in mind but I have no objection ...[intervenes]     ...to her placing on record if she wishes to.    Yes, Chairperson.     Ms Gigaba, could you please go toyour supplementary affidavit towards the end of Exhibit 26 at page 1027.8?     It will be amongst the last ten pages or so of that bundle.     1027.8.     At 1027.8, are you there?    You find the supplementary affidavit of yours.  If I could take you, please, to 1027.18?     You will see that it ends there and it includes an annexure.     1027.19, the letter from your attorney, through to 1027.22.  Do you see that?     If I could ask you, please, to go back to page 1027.18?  Do you confirm that you deposed to this affidavit on the 18 t h of May 2021?     Do you confirm that?    You confirm the truth and accuracy of this affidavit?     Chairperson, I would ask that you admit this affidavit of Ms Gigaba, dated the 18 t h of May 2012, commencing at Transnet Bundle 7, page 27.8 as Exhibit BB-26.4.     Ms Gigaba, I am going to take you through this affidavit before we turn to – me putting to you     Sub-2    And who is the previous counsel thatyou are speaking of there?     Sub-3    Sub-4    And then you deal with those concerns. “More specifically, the very fact that the affidavit contained information that I had no independent knowledge of and as a result created discomfort that I had addressed with Pretorius SC.This situation added to the failure to make the necessary corrections to my affidavit, some of which were material...”Do you confirm that?      Sub-6    Thank you, Chairperson.  And at 2.7    And then at 3    Then at 4    Alright. “Insofar as my first affidavit filed with theCommission is concerned, I wish to clarify the following paragraph as contained therein...”And then what you do is, you refer to paragraph 6 of your original affidavit and perhaps we can – you can keep our finger there and then you can open your main affidavit which you will find towards the beginning of that affidavit at paragraph 6, you will see a page 1000.  The paragraph 6 is a table of Mr Gigaba’s ministerial appointments, correct?     What you say at your paragraph 5.1     Then you deal with paragraph 10 in your correcting affidavit.  Paragraph 10 of your mainaffidavit that deals with - at page 1001 deals with – one of Mr Gigaba’s sisters, Mr Gugu Gigaba and makes reference to the fact that she was employed at Transnet in a particular position, a Manager in the Project Management Office.  In paragraph 5.2 of your correcting affidavit you     Then you deal with paragraphs 19 and 20.  This is something that you have testified to before the Chairperson.  Paragraphs 19 and 20 of your main affidavit at page 1003 deal with the Waterkloof issue, correct?     What you say in paragraph 5.3 of     Then you deal with paragraph 30.2of your main affidavit and this relates to the India trip and the date of it.  It is something that you have also dealt with in your evidence previously.  You say at paragraph 5.4 of     Then you go on to deal with     You say at your paragraph 5.5 ofyour correcting affidavit, that this was not within your personal knowledge.  It is a repetition of the point previously made, correct?     Then you deal with paragraph 44 of    And then the last correction that you want to make relates to paragraph 55.2 and 55.2 you will     That is the point that you want to make?     So those then are your concerns and your corrections?     Now, on the balance of this affidavit,you go on to deal with a different issue and perhaps I can pick up at paragraph 8 at page 1027.13.   “The submissions and/or suggestions made by Mr Solomons ...[intervenes]     Page 1027.13, Chairperson.     Yes. “The submissions and/or suggestions made by Mr Solomon SC on behalf of Mr Gigaba in his address to the Commission that I cannot be a reliable witness as I am an unhappy and/or bitter spouse going through a divorce and that as a result, my evidence were only serve my bitter purpose to seek to get to Mr Gigaba...”    Could you take us through that chronology of events, please?     You can read it or you can narrate it for us.     Yes?     Please would you speak into the microphone so I can hear you?     I do not have any difficulty but, Ms Gigaba, perhaps you could just speak to your affidavit?     If you do not mind.     So what paragraph are you on now?     What paragraph are you dealing with now?     9.4?     Yes, thank you.  So to carry on with      “What I want to say that only on 17 December 2020did I conduct a television interview with the eNCA after which I was immediately contacted by the Commission on 18 December 2010.” Is that correct?     So do I understand correctly from what you have told the Chairperson that you were arrested on the 31 July 2020, is that correct?     At paragraph 9.7, continuing with the    You go on to say that     “2. We are married out of community-of-property.” Is that correct?      “3. The other house that Mr Gigaba owns, there is still a huge amount owed to the bank in respect of the bond.” Is that right?      “4 The entire furniture in the house that we live in belongs to me.” Is that correct?  “5. I am no state or have any intention to fight with Mr Gigaba as we have two minor children together whom I had even proposedto leave with Mr Gigaba to avoid any further confrontation and dispute related to our divorce and so as to expedite it.” Is that correct?     And    Then you go on to say    And then you go on to deal with the     And then at 11     “And on the 26 March the NPA withdrew criminal charges against me which were related to my unlawful and malicious arrest at the instance of Mr Gigaba and is friend.” Is that right?     And at paragraph 10 you say    Paragraph 11    And what you had to go through in the process.     At 12    Do you have anything you wish to add to this affidavit?     Alright.  Now, Ms Gigaba, I am going to come back at the end of your evidence this evening to some of the things that you say at the beginning of theaffidavit in relation to the Commission.  I will also in the process take you through an affidavit that has been filed and deposed to Sakhile Masuku, who you find right at the end of your exhibit but for now what I want to do is to take you through Mr Gigaba’s evidence and put it to you andask for your comment.  Chairperson, what we have done, perhaps in a slightly unorthodox way, we have got two affidavits.  I have asked my secretary to cut and paste them into a schedule.  So what you will find on the left hand side is Ms Gigaba’s affidavit, and I will hand it up now, and on the right hand side Mr Gigaba’s affidavit.  It is a much easier way of finding what is in dispute and getting Ms Gigaba’s comment.     But I do not know if it has to be given any particular number, it is just an aid to presenting evidence.     When I refer to paragraph numbers it is of course to the numbers as you see there in the respective affidavits.     Yes.    Yes.  So Chairperson, if I could just then confirm for the record that on the left hand side there is a reproduction of Ms Gigaba’s main affidavit, that is the one that that you find commencing at page 999.    On the right hand side is a reproduction of Mr Gigaba’s affidavit and that is the affidavit that he filed in support of his application.     Which was indexed as SEQ18.     Of 2021.  Ms Gigaba, you have a copy of this schedule, do you?     Alright.  I want to start off by taking you please to paragraph 13 of your affidavit and that you see at page 4 of the schedule.  Are you there?     And what you say at paragraph 13 is that about a month or two before Mr Gigaba took up the position of Minister of DPE he told you that he had been told of that move by Ajay Gupta.  Do you recall giving that evidence?     Now what Mr …[intervenes]     Sorry, I beg your pardon, two to three months before.  Thank you, Chairperson.  So yourecall giving that evidence?     At paragraph 35, this is then on the     Could I take you to paragraph 14 of     Then at paragraph 15 you say in     Alright.  Do you accept that should have read child and not children?    And then I would like your comment     Right.  And then your paragraph 16, this is where you deal with the frequency with which Mr Gigaba visited the Guptas and you explain the frequency when parliament was sitting and then the frequency when     My question is how did you know?    I see.  What would he typically tell you.     When we deal with... [intervenes]    Thank you.  Now let us deal withparagraphs 17 and 18 of your affidavit.  Chairperson, the reason for the grey shading here is you will see that Mr Gigaba responds to a series of paragraphs and so when the grey shading is repeated it is the same answer, but it is in relation to a different one of those paragraphs.    So to summarise your paragraphs 17 and 18, you say that I first met his advisors and learnt of the identity during 2011.  I think you have just said that to the Chairperson.  When Mr Gigaba still held the position of DPE and you go on to mention that during late 2011 Mr Gigaba told you that his advisors wanted to meet you and your eldest son who had been born in June that year and you go on to explain that you then attended upon the Gupta residence, that you met with AJ Gupta, his wife andtheir son and that AJ Gupta gifted your son a gold jewellery necklace. And then at 17.2 by way of summary you say in 12 you visited the Gupta residence on several occasions     Now, Mr Gigaba says    Then at paragraph 54 he says    No, that is not what he is saying, Ms Gigaba.  He is saying you met the Guptas four times.     You have told DCJ that you went there more than 20 times.     You have also – we know you went to the Sun City wedding.  You have said you went to a Diwali celebration.  Did you also attend a cultural luncheon at the Guptas?    Lunch.  Did you go to a lunch at the Guptas?     Right.  So if you can go to paragraph 19 then of your affidavit.  This is where you deal with your visit to the Waterkloof Air force Base.  Now at paragraphs 19 and 20 we know that you have corrected. You make the point that you went there a day or two before the wedding and then on the day of the wedding you went to Sun City.  But in relation to your attendance at Waterkloof at paragraph 55 on the right hand side,     Now, paragraph 56 on the right hand side, Mr Gigaba responds to your version of the wedding and the removal of the henna pattern, etcetera.  He says this is nonsense and in the last sentence of that     Just to pick up on that, at     Alright.  If we go to yourparagraph 22, that is where you described what happened, the procedure that was followed when you visited the Gupta residence.  You talked about turning in your cell phone.  You talked about a briefing by Mr Gupta and then meetings being held in an adjacent room.  I just want to     At paragraph 61, the second     He says at paragraph 62    Alright.  Then if I can take you toparagraph 25 and this again deals with the briefing by Mr AJ Gupta of Mr Gigaba and you set out in paragraph 25 the various things that you overheard during those briefings.What Mr Gigaba says in response at     He says at paragraph 65 that    Thank you.  At paragraph 26 of your affidavit you said that at some stage Mr Gigaba told me that AJ Gupta wanted to get rid of Mr Dames and you say that you asked Mr Gigaba why and he said that the Guptas did not like him because there are things that he wassupposed to do but did not do.  Mr Gigaba responds at     Could I take you to paragraph 28 dealing with meetings at our home.  You said that during 13 Mr AJ Gupta met with Mr Gigaba at our then official residence.  You saw him there at most twice.  Meetings took place in an underground room or bunker.  And this is emphatically denied.  Do you want to comment on that?     At 29 you then go on to narrate what Mr Gigaba told you they were meeting about, Transnet tenders and an Eskom project that was giving him a    Thank you, then at paragraph 30 where you saying that Mr Gigaba invited staff from his office at the Department of Home Affairs to our residents prior to a trip to Mumbai and New Delhi, India and he denies that, have you got anything to add to that or do you stand by what you said?     I would like now to turn to your paragraph 30.2 and this is not something as I remember that we dealt with thoroughly in your initial evidence.  It is the India trip and that is because of the error in the date.  Your, correcting affidavit, correct paragraph 30.2 by saying instead of during or about 2010 it is 2015.      “I accompanied Mr Gigaba, I will take you through this, and other government officials on a trip to Mumbai and New Delhi, India.  Before the trip I overheard Mr Gigaba complaining to Mr Ajay Guptathat he could not go on a trip to India because he was still at the Department of Home Affairs.” In 2015, Mr Gigaba was at the Department of Home Affairs. Is that correct?      So I think we have discussed in consultations that the word still need not be there.      “I overheard Mr Gigaba complaining, this is yourversion, to Mr Ajay Gupta that he could not go on a trip to India because he was at the Department of Home Affairs.” Is that right?      “Therefore he could not justify a trip to discuss a new flight route between South Africa and India, which was a matter that fell under the DPE.” That was his previous portfolio.     “At a later stage, Mr Gigaba mentioned that he would create an official State visit to India whilst at the Department of Home Affairs so that he couldmeet the Indian nationals that Mr Ajay Gupta wanted him to meet in relation to the South Africa/Mumbai route.”     Sorry, Ms Gigaba but I want us todeal with the correction that needs to be made to 30.4.     So it is not later, do I understand you to be saying that he told you this during his tenure as the Minister of DPE?     Just bear with me about trying to get rid of the dates, he told you whilst he was the Minister of the DPE, is that correct?     Now, let us go to his version, of course, he deals with the error in the date the 2010 he makes the point that there was a trip in 2015.  Then he     2015.     Alright, so let us go to paragraph 31, here you deal with prior knowledge of appointments and     And then at 31.3, you say or said that  “Mr Gigaba also told me that he intended to speak to Mr Gama to appoint his sister, Ms Gugu Gigaba to Transnet.”    Then he says, at paragraph 83    Yes, it is - he told me that.     Then under the heading tensions     So in paragraph 33 you continued really with that theme, where you talked about therelationship becoming strained.  Getting around Mr Dames, Mr Gigaba starting to avoid telephone calls, being called to the Gupta residents and the fact that Mr Gigaba told you that Ajay told him that if he wanted to run the DPE as he wished he would be moved back to the Department of    Do you have anything to add?      Do you have anything to add in relation to that?     Right, if you can go to paragraph 34. You talk about Ms Myeni having facilitated your honeymoon trip and you say he would often meet with her at the Sheraton Hotel for lunch and thereafter would go to the     Then at the end of 89, the remainder of the allegations are denied.  So what that means is that Mr Gigaba is denying that Ms Myeni facilitated your honeymoon. Do you stand by your evidence in that regard?    Then at 35, you said    At paragraph 37 you said that    He is he saying I would not call her incompetent because I recommended her appointment.     Paragraph 38, you say that    And how did you know this?    Right.  Paragraph 40 dealing with Mr    Then at paragraph 41 you say it   Then we get the Gupta’s application for South African citizenship.  Now again I do not think thisis something from what I can remember that you dealt with in your evidence.  I just want to in any detail I just want to take you through these paragraphs.  During – at 42. “During Mr Gigaba’s term of office as Minister of the Department of Home Affairs he informed me that he was assisting some of the Gupta family members to obtain citizenship in South Africa.  He said that the Gupta’s were conducting business in South Africa and they needed their – and that theyneeded their family then living in India to be in South Africa.”Is that correct?    You confirm that?    At 43. “One day in 2015 Mr Gigaba came home with a blank official documents in a brown envelope which he informed me the Gupta’sneeded to sign.  I went with him to the Gupta residence and on arrival Mr Ajay Gupta greeted us.  Mr Gigaba went with Mr Ajay Gupta into a separate room carrying the brown – same brown envelope.  When we leftthe Gupta residence to go home Mr Gigaba carried the same brown envelope with him.  The next morning Mr Gigaba called me to ask about the whereabouts of the brown envelope.  He asked me to look for the brown envelope at home.  Later that same day he called again to inform that he had found the brown envelope in the boot of the car.”So what Mr Gigaba says is at 99. “This is once again a total fabrication.  Thislike all the other contents of the affidavit seemed to have been stitched together by Nomachule from various media reports over the years concerning myself.”What do you say to that?    At paragraph 100 he emphaticallydenied the contents and he says a suggestion of the brown envelope is a figment of your imagination.  You have addressed that correct?    Could we then go to paragraph 46. Now this deals with Mr Gigaba’s appointment as the Minister    Mr Gigaba says in that paragraph 103 that he never mentioned Mr Molefe’s name to you.    Yes can you address that?    Are you sure that he mentioned Mr Molefe’s name to you?    And that is in fact as I understand your evidence please correct me if I am wrong that is what upset him that he was effectively the second choice or the fall back choice.   Is that correct?    Then can I please take you to paragraph 49 under the heading Gifts.  Paragraph 49 youdeal with the fact that Mr Ajay Gupta gave Mr Gigaba a BMW.    And the simple or short response to that is the contents hereof are denied.  Do you confirm the contents of your paragraph 49?    How long did you drive this BMW for?    My colleague points out to me if I could take you back to paragraphs 42 and 43 that – I think I mentioned to you that I do not think that you dealt with this in your initial evidence.  What has been pointed out to methat these paragraphs under the heading Gupta’s Applications for South African Citizenship that was one of the things that you said needed to be re-crafted.    I see it is not something that you have addressed in your correcting affidavit.    Do you – do you then…    Yes I have – sorry I have gone backwards.    Yes I have gone backward.  Do you want to ask something about the BMW?    No, no – please.    Yes I just wanted to take you back to paragraphs 42 and 43.  When you initially gave evidence you indicated that these paragraphs would have to be re-crafted. But I have noted from your correcting affidavit that you do not deal with them.  Do you confirm then the accuracy of paragraphs 42 and 43?  This is your version.    That is paragraph 44.    But you happy with 42 and 43.    Right.  Then could I take you please to paragraph 50.  I just wanted to ask you this. You say at    So who invited the President and the Gupta’s?    Ja.  And he says at paragraph 107   Then at your paragraph 51 you deal with the costs of the wedding and the gift by the Gupta’s, payment for the honeymoon in Dubai.  Mr Gigaba says at    Alright.  Then if I could take you please to paragraph 54.  Now this is the paragraph where you explain that at the Gupta residence – this is the handover of money.  You say that Mr Gigaba would call one of his CPO’s to bring his leather bag – it was in the boot – it would be putat the front door – he would collect it.  Mr Gigaba would carry it to a private meeting room.  A short while later he would emerge with the bag – carry it out to the residence for the CPO to place in the boot.  I recall that Mr Gigaba had two of these leather bags.  You attach similar examples in photographs.  And then in 55 you go on to say that you subsequently came to learn that these bags had bundles of cash in.  Now what Mr Gigaba says at paragraph 110 is that    It is not a – it is not a particular problem.  Perhaps what I could do and of course I will raise this with Mr Gigaba as well and I will make sure that we have his affidavit here.    But I just want to – to read to you a portion of the transcript.  This is KMG3 it is the transcript ofthe ENCA interview. And this is at the foot of page 70 of SEQ8 of 2021.  You will recall Ms Gigaba this was worked through in consultation with you.    It records you as having said this   Sorry – this is about what you said.    During the ENCA interview.    What you said is   Mr Gigaba says that you said during the ENCA interview that you had never seen him receive any cash.   Alright.      Sorry Ms Gigaba.      Just so that we understand.     You did not see Mr Gigaba.    Get money physically get money/    From the Gupta’s.  As I understand it you describe what happened.   And then you describe at paragraph 55    And there you explain the shopping in Sandton City alright.    And you at – on another occasionspeak about the unpacking of the money into a safe, is that correct?    Right.    Sorry I just want you to confirm.      That you did not see him.    Receive money.  You did not see money being put into the bag.    At the Gupta residence.    How did you come to learn that he received money from the Gupta’s?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes you have explained that.    And how else?  Where there other occasions that you came to learn.    Yes.  In Sandton.    And what happened in Sandton?    Yes.   At 55.1 you say    “At Sandton City and in my full view Mr Gigaba would take bundles of cash out of the same leather bag that he had brought fromthe Gupta residence.”Is that right?    Right.      Yes.    Let me put the question another way.   How many times were you together with Mr Gigaba in Sandton City after a visit to the Gupta residence?  How many times?    Yes.    And how many times were you with Mr Gigaba when he bought suits?   And where did the money come from for the suits?    Yes.    Yes.  And where did the money come from in that bag?    Yes but where did he get the moneyfrom?    DCJ I am told that we have to adjourn very urgently.      It is apparently a protector relatedissue.    And perhaps we could do that remotely DCJ if that would be better.    Yes.    Yes.   We wanted to start at nine tomorrow.    With Mr Gigaba.  I think we probably need to get an early – as early a start as possible DCJ.   Tomorrow morning.    Whatever you have – you consider appropriate.    Yes.    Yes.    And then I will – I will rearrange thingswith Mr Pita.    Thank you.    DCJ sorry could I just ask you one thing?  Tomorrow you – we have to stop as you will recallwith Mr Gigaba at four o’clock because his counsel has got for religious reasons.  If I – if Mr Pita is available tomorrow at four.    Could we try and fit him in then?    No well I suppose that is not going to work.  Perhaps I could discuss that with you in chambers.    Thank you. 
MS GIGABA:   [No audible reply]     Good afternoon.    Chairperson, I apologise.  I would havewanted to probably just assist by inserting a few corrections on the supplementary affidavit which Mr Myburgh might be dealing with now.  There are just some two cosmetic changes so that we place them on record so that we can place them on record ...[intervenes]    I would believe from the correspondence we have had that they have not been brought to his attention.  However ...[intervenes]     ...they do not appear as such on the supplementary affidavit.     Chair, it is strictly to deal with paragraph 66.4 of the original affidavit bundle, page 1015.     Indeed, Chair.     [No audible reply]     At the first line, paragraph 66.4, shows the date of 18 June 2020 ...[intervenes]     66.4.     At page 1015, Chair.    The main affidavit ...[intervenes]     ...the content is otherwise ...[intervenes]     No, no.  We missed them for somethingstated here.  I think we printed the final version, somebody just did not put that up ...[intervenes]     Indeed.     Indeed, Chair.     Chair, it will be the ...[intervenes]     66.4, first line.     The date reflected there is 18 June 2020.      It should state the 20 t h of July 2020.  At the second line, the date reflected is 24 June 2020.  The correct date would then be 22 July 2020.     Apart from that, Chair, it will only be the cosmetic change to the supplementary affidavit     Where at paragraph 9.4 the last line ...[intervenes]    [No audible reply]     The supplementary affidavit is at 1027.8.     Paragraph 9.4, Chair.  The last line of the paragraph.     It says to “his commission” when it is supposed to be to “this commission”.     That is it.  Those are the only pages, Chair.     Thank you very much.     [No audible reply]     In this bundle?     Okay.     Yes.     [No audible reply]     Yes.     Yes.    [No audible reply]     Yes, I do.     Yes, I do.     Yes.     Yes.     It was Advocate ...[indistinct]     Yes, I do.     Yes, I do.     Yes, I do.     Yes, I do.     Thank you, Chair.    Yes, I do.     Yes.     Yes, I do.     Yes, sir.    Yes, I do.     Yes, I do.     Yes.     Yes, it is correct.     Yes, it is correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, it is correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     So must I read it from 9.1?    Okay.  So what happened in 2020 earlier – last year, I went to Mr Gigaba.  I told him that I want to – I want a divorce, which then he said why I want a divorce. So I explained the reasons why I wanted the divorce.  So I have my personal reasons why I was not happy in the marriage and I think he was comfortable with us to get a divorce and also it was good for our kid to grow up in a positive environment.  So then he said he does not – he is not ready for a divorce because he was busy preparing for the State Capture and also he was busy doing his submissions for his PhD and thirdly he said he was not ready for a divorce at all because he had a lot of distractions because he hadto focus on preparing for the state capture.  So then he agreed ...[intervenes]     Preparing for the state capture.     So then he agreed to – he asked me give him time and I agreed to that.       So then we continue that.  So he came again to me, I think it was later in the middle of the yearalso last year.  He asked me – he was like there was someone at home who is an expert in IT.  He was asking for my gadgets, my cell phones.  Someone is wiping the     Sorry.  So then I refused to give him mygadgets because for me I felt like why he must delete the information?   So I thought it was easier for him to come to the Commission to tell the truth so that we do not have to come up and come up.  And also, I asked him the other thing, I was like why we cannot divorce just because you are going to the Commission because I did understand how I get involved with the Commission because Commission has never called me – there is nothing that involves me with any [indistinct] or with his work because I have never worked for government.  So then he explained that if we divorce he is going to – we are going to lose a spousal privilege, so he want to go to the Commission while he was still married.  So that brought to confusion to me but I said to him I do not want to give my gadget and it ended there.  And he was a bitannoyed.  So he went back – so that expert was in his study room, so I think they spoke, the guy left.A week or two weeks later that is where everything started and then it was the arrest, where I got arrested.  So the Hawks came to our home because I sent a Whatsapp to Malusi’s friend.  So Malusi called me at home, he said the police are calling me, so I went downstairs at home and they said they want to all gadgets.  So I asked them why you want all my gadgets?  They said they want all my gadgets because I sent a Whatsapp message toMalusi’s friend and then I said okay, I was carrying a phone but not this one, the one before this upgrade.  So I said to them okay, here is the phone that I used but I deleted the message.  So they said they need to take the phone, I said there is no problem but this is the phone that I use, you can take it.  They said no, we want all your gadgets and we need to go with you upstairs because we know that all your gadgets are upstairs.  So I said okay, I am coming back.  They said no, I am not allowed to go on my own, they had to come with me.So ion the time we all went – before we go upstairs then I said I want to go to the bathroom and then they refused, they said I am not allowed to go on my own.  Then I begged them that can I go to the bathroom?  So then one police – I do not know, must I mention their names or Imust not?  I can?  I do not know must I mention their names or not?     Okay.     Sorry?     I am 9.4.     Yes.     Okay.  So I went …[intervenes]     I am reading that but it is like I prefer to talk because everything that I am saying is what is here, that I am to read?     Yes.  Okay, ja, I am …[intervenes]     Oh, okay.     So what happened, Sir, they went upstairs with me.  My kids were there with me, so we all went upstairs.  Then we went to my bedroom.  So then they said they want my iPad.  So then I said I have not used my iPadfor two years because I used to use where I used to work.  So then they said they want it and they also told that they want my laptop.  Then I gave them my laptop.  And then they asked me where is my Huawei phone?  I was just shocked because I did not tell them that I have a Huawei phone.  So they told me where is my Huawei phone?  So then I went with them in my walking in closet which – that is my bedroom, then you go in closer to the bedroom.  So the police came with me, then I took the Huawei phone, then I gave it to them.  So they took all my phones and allof this, we went downstairs.So when we were downstairs they asked me to put my phones at the centre of the table.  They said they have to check all my gadgets, they have to leave with them.  So then I asked them why all my gadgets need to be taken fora Whatsapp message and I am not denying that I sent a message and here is the phone that I used so why all the gadgets and especially the laptop?  And I even told them that I was using my laptop for school because I was writing exams at that time so can they have it – so they refused, they said they have to take everything.  Then I asked them can I call a lawyer?  They said I am not allowed to call a lawyer.  Then I said I know that right, it is in every person in South Africa, you have a right to call a lawyer.  They said that right only remains withSAPS, not with the Hawks, they are the Hawks, so I do not have that right, so which they refused for me to call the lawyer because I wanted to call the lawyer to ask  why my gadgets were taken by the Hawks.So after that they asked me – so one of them were sitting on my right hand side, other one was sitting on my left side, in my left hand side, and then they – so this one on the right she said to me I need to put all my passwords and my pins and they want to make sure that my gadgets are working and firstly, we had an argument because I saidno, why I have to give you my gadgets because if you are doing an investigation you can take the gadgets because I work in the IT industry, you can take the gadgets, you put them on the machine, you can able to download everything, I do not have to give you my password and my pins.  Sothey said I need to cooperate with them because if I do not I am going to be arrested by that time.So I still wanted to argue with them but I look at my son, my son was behind me, because he was crying, I look at him then I was like let me just not fight because I do not want my son to see this, let me just give them my gadgets.  So then we started – I give them my pass code, which they put, they wanted my pin, they put them, we went through each and every gadget, they wanted to make sure, they wrote on the paper, all my pins and everythingand then after that they took all my gadgets, five of them, they put them in the plastic and then – so after that they said oh, we are here, we heard there was a scratching of the car in the house.  So the minute they say that, they said oh, we need to take the gadgets we are investigating something in the house so we are going.  So which they left with my gadgets on the day, all of them.  Then after that I asked the helper to me the phone, I called a friend of mine who is a lawyer, I told him the whole story said no, it is a lie, Hawks and SAPS everyonein the country, you have a right to call the lawyer and also they are not supposed to take my gadgets just because I sent a Whatsapp or even if there was a scratched car at home and that – it was that they left.I went to Malusi upstairs, he was sitting upstairs,then I told him that these people they took my phone, why they are taking my gadgets?   Malusi said to me just let the police do their job.  I was like why the police are doing their job, why all that because I was just confused, what have I done wrong and they left with my gadgets.The whole week – so the whole week I kept on asking him because I was writing exams and that time we were on I think level 4, level 3, I was doing online clusters and I need to submit my exams and then I had nothing to use and I could not go to study at my friends placebecause that time we were not allowed to visit.   But Malusi kept on telling me that no, the police are working, they will bring back my stuff.And then the week ended, the second week I went to – I called a friend of mine again, I asked her can you please get me a lawyer, I want o open a case because my gadgets are not back yet and I do not understand, Malusi keep on saying no, they are coming back.  So then he said he is going to call the General – I think the Brigadier, which is Brigadier Ngwenya, those police who came theyare reporting to him.  Malusi said he is going to call him to bring back my gadgets and then I asked him two hours later, I said what did he say?  So he said no, he cannot call him, you need to go meet him because the Intelligence is linked to them and their phone.    My gadgets were brought back, they did not – they only brought back my gadgets after I was arrested, that was two weeks later.     A lot of information was not on my gadgets.  So the kind of information that was deleted on my gadgets– because the day I got arrested I said to Malusi in the morning if the police are not here today to bring my gadgets because I have been waiting for you, I went to see a lawyer and my lawyer- we are going to go open the case.  If they are not here by 2 p.m. I am opening a case and you will explain that because I had everything that now this was unlawful, was not supposed to happen.So on that date we waited, Malusi said no, they are on the way, then he said I am going to help you with my own computer.  So Malusi was typing my assignment, thenI was writing my other assignment, so which was two assignments I was doing at the same time because I was a bit behind but the school understood.  So what happened on that day, while I was waiting for them to bring my gadgets came in the room, he said the police are herelooking for you.  I jumped quickly and I was so excited, I thought they were bringing my gadgets.  So when I got there they said you are under arrest, we need to arrest now.  I said what have I done.  They said you are under arrest and then I asked them that can I go change?  So they said I am not allowed to go alone, so they went with me, then I changed then I got arrested on that day.  And then …[intervenes]     No.     They were brought back three days later on Tuesday because I got arrested on Friday, the 31 July.  So I could not get a bail on the day because when the Hawks arrested me they switch off their phones and also they were nowhere to be found and they left the police station with the docket.     Because – so I went on my phone on Tuesday after appearing in court on Monday, so onTuesday we went to fetch my gadgets at the police station.  Then I started opening all of them. Then what I found out, everything Malusi, when he explained, when he said what we need to delete everything that related to the Guptas and to the trips that we had taken as a family, to the car that was bought by the Guptas.  So then I started paging to check.  So they did not delete everything, all my data, but what was deleted, it is all our trips that we did to Dubai that the Guptas paid for us and it was all the pictures of the car that was given as a gift to him and also it was apicture that I took in Sun City at their wedding, at the Gupta wedding.  So most of – all the information it was related to that.  So everything was deleted.     Yes, it is correct.     Yes, it is correct.     Yes.     Yes, it is correct.     Yes.     Yes, it is correct.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes, it is correct.     Yes, it is true.     Yes, it is correct.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I am fine.     Yes I do.    Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     So it is not true that he did not know, he only heard on the day.  He told me two to three months before and also – because he was very excited about the position.  I asked him what does it mean to be a Minister of DPE because that kind of portfolio I was not familiar with.  So then he explained to me that DPE means PublicEnterprises and then he explained to me that he is going to be overseeing all the SOEs.  He explained with so much of excitement.  So I think to - three and half to three months before he got his appointment, so it is not true what he is saying that he knew only on that day.    It was not true that I was not staying in Pretoria at that time, I moved to Pretoria when I was pregnant and when Malusi became the Minister of Public Enterprises we were already staying together and when it comes to this thing of special advisers, it was him who told me that the Guptas were his special advisers and I remember in the beginning I used to get confused when he talks about special advisers, who are the advisers,because sometimes he will say I am seeing my advisers and then I see Thami Msomi, something he was saying I am seeing my advisers, I am going to Jo’burg and I knew that Thami was staying in Pretoria, then I would like who are the advisers that you are talking about?   So every time when he will talk I will always want him to make it clear who is he talking about.  So it is not true that he never had one.     It is irrelevant that he is arguing about the children, it is mistake that I said our children, I said our child because Malusi was hardly at home, most of the time when he arrived from Cape Town he will just go – he willsay now I am rushing to the [indistinct] all the time and then he knew that our son was very sick at the time, I needed him to be at home.  So this is not true.     Yes, we had one child in 2011.     Because he told me.  So he is the one who used to tell me that where is he going and he will explain when I asked him where are you going, who are you meeting then he used to explain it to me.    In my knowledge he used to go there a lot.  It is not true that he went there maybe one time.     He told me.     He will tell me that he is going to see his advisors or he will say he is going to see AJ and there were times where he will go there with his bodyguards without me and there were times he will ask me to go with him.  So we were forever – most of the time we were forever there.       I can say an estimation because I do not know exactly the number, but I know it is more than 20times.  It is a lie that it was four or three times, because we used to go there when Malusi had meetings, then I would sit and wait for him to finish meetings and sometimes we will go there for lunch where we would just sit with AJ with their son and also with the wife.There will be times where we will just go, because Diwali – only on one Diwali.  So when Malusi is saying we used to go there for events we only attended to events in the 10 years that I am with him.  So most of the time it was – it is either lunch or his meetings, but we used to go there very often together.     So from 2011 I did not go there a lot myselfbecause I had a little baby as well as 2012 I did not go that much, so but he used to go.  Then sometimes we will go with the child when they want to see the child.     I mean, this was 2011 when AJ wanted to see my son.     I do not remember when was it, but it waswhen Malusi was taken back to Home Affairs.  By that time they were not that close anymore.     Yes.     Ja, I am not saying exactly it was 20.  I think it was more than that.     No, 10 times it is not.     It is 10 times less, ja.    It is more than that.     It cannot be 10 times.  It is either from 20 upwards.     Because we were frequently there.     Yes, it is correct.    I do not understand why he is denying that, because when we got there AJ was so excited to see him.  The minute he held our son he gave him the gift.  It was ina box, then he took it out, he put it into my son and then Malusi took it out, then he put it back on the box and he carried it.  So if they are not that close, why would AJ want to gift our son with a necklace, because he does not even know it is a boy or girl if he does not know. So I think this is a lie.  So I do not even understand why he would, because they gave him the necklace and they wanted to see him when he was still small and I was asking why they want to see our children – our child.  But that he was denying it, but it is true, so it happened.ADV MYBURGH     I remember in my statement what is not true we never attended so many events there.  Most of when we went there it was meetings and also I only attended one Diwali at the Guptas’ house and I only attended one event.  So it was not like we will go there because of events.   There were less events in my knowledge.  So most of the time when we were there it was meetings between Malusi and AJ and sometimes it will be his advisors will be there and Malusi will be taken in a room.  That is whatused to happen and I still remain by my statement.     Also I still remain by my statement.  I do not understand why Malusi is saying we did not frequent visit there because we used to go.  But not only he used to go there by me alone, there were times where he will go with his protectors.  There was even time when he would not go with the whole protection cars, because he had two cars.   Sometimes he will ask one of the bodyguards because he was close to one of them, he will ask him, Chief, can you please take me there.  And I remember most of the time when that bodyguard used to come he will say,okay, I want to sign first at the gate and Malusi will call him, rush him not to sign because he says you need to rush, there is something they need to fix with AJ.  So they will just go.So when they come back, then the bodyguard will want to go – there is a house, a small house that was closer to our house where there is Police and then he will like – I want to go there, because when I arrive I did not sign.  Then Malusi is like, no Chief, go, we will sort that out and then the bodyguard will leave.  So it was if I can count his with the bodyguard, because sometimes he will go one bodyguard or he will go with a whole entourage and we will go all of us, that is so many times.  So it is not true that Malusi was there two or three times.    That is not true.     Yes.     I do not know what is cultural luncheon.     But not like a cultural thing.  We will have lunch as us, AJ and his wife and my son and their son, but it was not like a cultural thing.     This one I still remain by my statement which Malusi is not telling the truth.  Myself and our son that evening when their – what is it – their aircraft landed, so Malusi said to me at home let us go there, he has been asked.  So I did not ask who asked him to go receive the people.  So he will ask can you please go with me and we went there.So what happened, myself and our son, the olderone, we sat in the room and then Malusi went out to receive the Gupta people coming in for the wedding.  So it was not only us, because outside there were a lot of Metro Police cars who were coming to receive them as well, but they were outside.  So me and my son remain inside. Malusi went out.  I did not know what he did on them.  So they landed and they were taken by cars.So when they were leaving, then Malusi we went to our car going home and there were a lot of Metro Police like escorting the Gupta cars leaving and then we went home.  So for me it does not even make sense why he want to protect the Guptas because we were there.  I do not even know why he wants to protect that, why he say it was a lie, because we did it.  We were there.  We received them.    He did not refuse.  He forced us to leave, because they booked us the house.  So on the following day I did not know that we are going to go to the wedding. I did not know that also we were invited on the wedding.  So on the wedding day I was at work.  Malusi called me that I had to accompany him to go to Sun City. So then I said to him, no, he must leave me, I cannot go because I have not done my hair, everything.  Ijust cannot go to the wedding.  I do not even have an outfit.  Then he was like no, we need to go, let us go.  So please come back home.     Malusi was not aware that our attendance was going to be on the news and there will be noise about it.  He did not know.  So when that happened he panicked, then he said I must delete it and then also he said let us go home. So if the way he is saying like he knew thateverything will be documented, so why we packed our clothes and why the room was booked, then all of a sudden why we have to drive in the middle of the night going back home.  So he was not aware that such a thing will happen.     So also that is not true and I even asked him so many times why we had to leave our cell phones, because there is a – when you come in there was a table, I think two tables before you go proceed to a big living room where they used to leave me and AJ where he used to come and brief Malusi there before they go to another room that was opposite where he used to leave me.So before when we go in they used to ask us to leave our phones.  And then the other day I asked him why they always take my phone because the whole hour – because those meetings used to last like an hour and half and then I am sitting there by myself and Malusi is there inthe meeting and I am bored.  So I asked him why our phones.  So he said there was confidential information which we are not allowed to have our phones with us. But most of the time I used to go, maybe five minutes later I used to go take my phone and sit down with it and Malusi never liked those things.  So it is a lie when he said our cell phones were not taken.  It is him who knows what was confidential, but I did not know what was confidential.  But that is not true.  And also I do not even understand why he keep on protecting or covering theGuptas, because that was the procedure that was happening there.     So also this is not true.  So every time we used to arrive and it happens most of the time we go there.  So when we go there is someone who will take us outside and then they will ask us to leave our phones, then they will take us in a room.  So maybe like five minutes or sothen AJ used to come and greet us, maybe just like make a few little jokes or sometimes we will wait for tea or something and then AJ will sit next to Malusi while I am there and then he will brief him about something about what that meeting. So there are times where Tami [?] would be there, which works in his office or sometimes Siyabonga Mahlangu will be there also and they will be waiting with him and they will go with Malusi into a room.  So I do not understand why he is saying that never happened, becausewe never been received by AJ from the door.  We were always received by other people and AJ will always come while we are sitting and AJ will brief Malusi so that he know what the meeting is about and they were taken in. So that was the normal procedure, unless it is not a meeting, it is a lunch, we go, we are chilling, we are sitting there, then they would not take him to a meeting.  So that was the normal procedure in that home.     They were there.     AJ used to brief Malusi in front of me and then they will go there.  So the entire meeting never happened in front of me because AJ used to take him inside that room where they used to have meetings.    I do not even understand why he will talk about the media, because at our home Malusi did not even allow us to watch the news most of the time or also maybe read the newspapers as well.  So everything that I said itis something that I have seen or that is something that he told me.  So I would never go to the media and go collect information about him.  What I have given here it is something that I have seen and something that I heard from him that he told me.  When it comes to the India trip, India trip happened when Malusi was taken back to Home Affairs, but I know a couple of times when AJ will tell Malusi when he was still with DPE he will say you need to go meet those people and also I want to know what the feedback between the SAAand sometimes they will argue. Malusi say – I remember Malusi saying to him I cannot go with a State visit to go meet those people because AJ wanted them to cancel the airline, the SAA airline and put the Mumbai airline.  And Malusi said hecannot go on his own.  He need to justify the trip.  And then AJ will be like no, you can go with the SAA.  Then Malusi was like, he cannot do that because he need to justify the trip. So they used to have like a back and forth how Malusi will go to Mumbai doing that airline and sometimes they will have a back and forth with him, it is him and also with Dudu Myeni.  So there were discussions most of the time where they will talk about that before the trip and then Malusi was taken back to Home Affairs before he travelledto India.  But the trip happened when he was at Home Affairs he went to India.     Ja, most of the time beside his work purpose, our marriage were more exposed to a lot of scandals which sometimes if I come I tell him that, Malusi, I saw this maybe in the paper, what is happening.  Because most of the time when something would be on the paper Malusi would never tell me.  So I will hear maybe whenpeople are sending me messages oh, sorry about what happened. Because Malusi will do the whole statement in public without even telling me what is happening.  So I will see things when it is already trending, because he nevertold me what was happening.  So because of that he wanted us not to read papers so that we avoid of seeing things that are being said about us.  Because since we got married in 2014 like our family has been in papers for his scandals most of the time.  So then he did not want us to read newspapers.  So it is just so untrue for him that I got that from outside.     Most of the time I will watch news when Malusi is in Cape Town, because it was not most of the time Malusi was at home.  Because from Tuesday to Thursday he was in Cape Town, then I will be alone, ja.     Also this is not true on his side, because I remember AJ saying to Malusi he need to put pressure on Brian Dames so that Brian Dames must resign – can resignand Malusi what I remember, Malusi was very fond of Brian Dames, even myself.  We like him at home because he was such a nice guy, very chilled, although I do not know his work that much because I was not following his work. But the Guptas did not like Brian and Malusi liked Brian and every time when they used to talk Malusi and AJ, then Malusi were like why they do not want, then AJ will tell Malusi that no, there are certain things that he is not doing.  And also I asked him why they do not like him, because to me he appears as a nice guy, as much I did notknow his job. Malusi said that there were things that he was not doing and AJ they wanted him to do and AJ was asking Malusi to put pressure on Brian so that Brian can resign and leave Eskom.  And in a couple of months it happened,because I remember Malusi told me that Brian was leaving and it was sad.  And I knew he did not like it, but they put pressure on him.     So this one is – he can call it whatever hecalls that room, but it is the only room that you take the stairs then you go downstairs, because all our rooms in the State house they are on top which is on the top surface and that room it goes down and it hold Malusi’s safety and also has where Malusi usually holds his meeting. So when AJ he came at our home two times and I remember because when Malusi say I must come and say hi to him, then I wanted to offer him something to eat and he refused.  Then I said to Malusi on the second time, because also he refused to eat, I was like I just do not likethis thing of AJ he does not eat here, but when we go to their house they always even when you say we do not like it, because most of the time they like vegetarian food and I do not like vegetarian food, so they will say no, try this, try this and Malusi was like no, you can even when you do notlike it just try.  But when he came to our house he did not even want to try. So I remember having that conversation with him why AJ does not want to eat when he comes to our house, but when we go to their house then we have to eat their food.  So it is a lie when Malusi said AJ never came to our house.  He came twice.     I stand by what I said, especially when I say it gives me a headache. There was this project called Kusile, it was at Eskom, and I remember most of the time that project at Kusile used to give Malusi a lot of time, thenhe will go discuss things with Ajay, and I will be there as well when they were talking but he was saying like I do not know what was so - he was given a lot of time about Kusile Project. And I even remember when Malusi left, that project was not completed, but I even remember Malusi went and visit that project with his team at Eskom.  So I knew because I was there when they were talking.  So when he is answering this, his just like giving, like a general that Ministers are not allowed, but him he was involved.    Maybe he can call it with his own way, but that house is still there because it was a State house, it is still there.  So he can call it the way he want to call it.  I call it underground because all of our rooms, they are on top.    But there is one room that if you take the stairs you go down and when you go out, you go the pool, that was only that room and that was the room that Malusi use to hold meetings.  So if someone comes at home, upstairs you will not see Malusi who is he meeting with because that house is just – and that house is still there.     Yes.    The others are on top, all of them.      Then it is the only one just takes the stairs, you go down and then there is a balcony, then when you stand at the balcony, then you see the pool.     Yes.     Also how the house is built, so when you come in, if you walk in, you will not know that you can still go down.  So you will think you are just here and when you go further in the house, you can take the stairs on theother side of the house.  Then there’s other…[intervene]     Other rooms, but there are upstairs but there's on other wing of the house.      So when you come in at home, you will not know that you can go down.     Yes, but it was the only house, this is the way the house was built.     So he did invite his staff and what happened – and what I said to him, because when he has these meetings with his staff, because when he has staffmeeting, he will have people from the Ministerial which is people that are close working with him and maybe he will have maybe one person or two people from the department because the Ministerial team are different from the department people. So then what I said to him, I was like when you have these people, we do not run out because sometimes I do not know Malusi is going to host these people and then people they just come in the evenings.  Then now I have to make sure that I had to accommodate them.  Then where Malusi started, so his PA used to come early and prepare for that.  Then he will order takeaways and on that room that I am taking about then because there was an eight seater table.  So then he will come an order and prepare so that everyone when they come they havewater, they have snacks and everything.  So they use to order takeaways because he never tells me prior to the meeting.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     So the first time I heard about the Mumbai airline and the SAA airline, Malusi was at DPE at the time. So he used to talk about that, that they need to cancel SAAairline and then they need to bring Mumbai airline and that is where most of Malusi’s arguments if I can put it that way with Ms Dudu Myeni it was more of that because they used to argue about it.     Yes.     So when it comes to dates, I explained in our consultation about the year…[intervene]     Yes.     He did that, but he knew that he had to come up with something so that he can justify why he wentthere and I remember, he went there with the team because we stayed maybe two or three days in New Delhi.  Then a few days later, we moved to Mumbai, where we stayed at the hotel.  So when we were in Mumbai, then Malusi that is where he did his own meetings, becausewhen we were in the room, he will say, eish, because he was tired, because when we were in New Delhi it was raining so hard, it was flooding and then Malusi was going with his team and then some of the meetings, I do not know, he did it alone, so I cannot say that.  But when we were in Mumbai, then Malusi was tired and he was like, I need to go do this meetings Ajay arranged this, so he would leave the hotel, our room and go downstairs to meet the people that Ajay arranged for him to meet when we were in Mumbai. So maybe he will not declare all the trips, but they were trips, there were meetings that he did that Ajay arranged for him, but he could not leave South Africa, only for those meetings.  So he had to take the whole department with him so that he can justify that.     2015.      Yeah, he was taken back.     Yes.     But he knew before he became the CEO of Eskom, Malusi told me so he knew before.     Yes, when Gugu was given a - Malusi said no you can take it then I will talk to Gama to - he will find something for you.  I did not say Malusi was DPE when shestarted but what I know of Malusi spoke to Mr Gama to find work and also what I remember Gugu came to stay with us in Joburg before she even found a job.  So she came, I think he stayed with us for a month or two months or so, at our home before she even got a job at Transnet.  So whenshe left, KZN the job was not there yet, but Malusi said he must take - he must move her stuff, then he moved her things she came to stay with us at home before she started the job.     Yes, that is what he said.     So what he is saying that it is not true because Malusi told me these things, and I will never come up and give the word advisors to the Gupta’s.  So it is him who told me the Gupta’s are his advisors, I think the other day I even asked him why you call them advisors, and whyyou always rush to go there and you go to work, you have to go to Cape Town.  And I remember there was a time when Malusi was at DPE then Ajay will call Malusi and Malusi will ignore his calls and I asked him like what is wrong, why now you are ignoring - because in the beginning, when he was appointed he loved taking their calls, he loved us going there but later before he leave he did not have like a good relationship with them.  Then I asked him what is wrong, then he said, theyputting pressure on him and there was a time where Ajay reminded Malusi, he said remember why you were appointed because Malusi will argue.  I remember the other time Ms Dudu Myeni did not like Kalawa he used to call Malusi and he will complain about him and Malusi lovedKalawa as a CEO during that time and Ajay also they did not like Kalawa and there was a lot of things between Eskom, Transnet where Ajay they would want Malusi to do certain things, and Malusi did not want to and then Ajay one day, he told him that Malusi, he must remember why he was appointed to those post.  So it is a lie when he says he never - he had a headache - later, before he left he was taken back, the relationship was not like it was in the beginning.  So what happened in the beginning he was excited, after a yearwhen he was at DPE Malusi wanted to run the department the way he wanted and Ajay they wanted him to run things the way they wanted and they had the conflicts most of the time.     Yes, because I remember there was a timewhen Malusi will be like, in the evening, he will come home, then he is tired and then he will say the reason he does not like the Gupta’s being involved in his job.  So he has a PA keeping his diary.  So according to him and his PA, he knows how his diary work and his Ministerial team,and he has some meetings with his Deputy and other people.  But now when Ajay calls, so Ajay will demand Malusi to just leave everything and then it puts Malusi under pressure because Malusi was complaining that it makes him look unprofessional because now he will ask his PA to cancel the meeting and maybe people they were coming somewhere to see him. So now it was just disorganising everything that is the other thing that he did not like and also what I have noticed, it was – Malusi like certain people like BrianDames, Monalusi Kalawa also he had a good relationship with Brian, we have become family all of us and even with Gama we attended their wedding.  So certain people when they were moved during like sometimes restructuring Malusi did not like it because he always have a team - how he works with them and then now those people are being removed, so he did not like that.     I have addressed this and I remember in my statement.     Sorry?     I do not understand why he is denying this whole thing because it was very stressful on him and also the stress - because I remember at that time, where he was so stressed when Ajay will want Malusi to do this and this he will – then there was a time when Malusi would go to Rosebank Hospital because he started having migrainesand lots of them where he would just go there and he needs to take injections for his migraines.  So his work became like - he could not control - he did not have control of his work.  He wanted to work to do his work but he could not disagree with them because Iremember the other time when he had a migraine then I even asked him, why do you not tell them that you do not want to do it?  Then he said he cannot.  So it came - he will go to the to the Saxonwold, the Gupta’s even when sometimes he did not want to, sometimes he will avoid his call. And there were times where Tami[?] will come at home we will tell him that Ajay says you are not answering the calls.  No, you must try, he needs to go and then he will do it but their relationship was not like when he wasappointed in the beginning.  So it changed a little bit because Malusi felt like they were interfering in his job.     Because I will go with him, so what happens Ms Myeni used to book a room at Sheraton Hotel, and myself and Malusi will go there then they will have a meeting, then I will sit there and sometimes we will havelike - sometimes then he will ask me, how are the boys, are they growing, and then after then ii will sit and then they will talk in their own meeting.  So they will to book a room but Dudu use to book a room then Malusi will come in, then they will have a meeting.     Yes, I stand by my evidence.     The one in Pretoria.     Even as we stand right now, they do not  get along, if they can do that they will be just pretending because I remember when Malusi was taken back at HomeAffairs he was very angry, he felt like the President was influenced more by Dudu Myeni because Dudu Myeni also repeated the words that were said by Ajay, that if Malusi does not want to take instructions, he will be taken back and Malusi was like, he will never touch me, because in his head, he has that impression that he comes first to the President, all the other Ministers were just - so every time when maybe a reshuffle will happen Malusi was - he always thought he will never be you know, tasks or he will only - he will be like the first preference to be given. So when Dudu Myeni and Ajay Gupta said Malusi will be taken back, so he said something like that will never happen.  So when it happened, he was very angry and he said he knows it was the influence from Dudu Myeni, she had the influence on the President to take him back.     Yes, because on the day, I remember when he came back at home, so he was called in the evening and he was told that his going to be taken back to HomeAffairs. So you are going to be no longer a Minister of DPE.  When he came back home, he was so angry, and he just went back to the bedroom.  And then I said what happened, what did he say? I thought he was fired the way he was so devastated.  Thenhe said, no, they taking me back to Home Affairs.  So - and I knew it just because of Dudu Myeni and the Gupta’s and then I said why you did not tell them, why you did not tell the President?  He said I could not raise those things, because there were top six around there so I did not want to say those things.  Then I asked him what did the President say to you when he was taking you back, what was the reason?  Then he said, the President said Malusi need to tighten the borders.     Also, what his…[intervene]     So he used to say that a lot.  He used to say he does not understand why the President made Dudu Myeni the Chairperson of SAA because Malusi felt like Dudu Myeni did not understand the job and also he wasinterfering in the SAA Board.  He even mentioned that sometimes he will go attend the meetings, the Board and he will take some of the information and give it to uBaba[?] before it was given by people who need to give uBaba[?] the information.  And also there was a lot of – they did not get along most of the time, Malusi and Dudu and Malusi used to question, he was like I do not like the way she works she does not understand the job.  I do not understand why the President appointed her.  So that is him, he use to say thatto me.      That is him, he use to call the President like that.     I do not know the rumour and I do not know anyone in this house knows that kind of rumour, I only know this thing from him.     Because he told me.     Because he does not know how to respond of what he should do.    That is what he told me because I asked him why did he not ask the President why he was removing him from – into Home Affairs that is what he said.    Yes it is correct.    Yes he told me that.    I am not sure why he keep on protecting them because everything you said something like he told me is something that I have seen.  So that incident it happened at home when he came back at the Gupta’s house with that envelope. And also I remember when the media used to have like – they used to comment about the Gupta’s in the country why they only build – and Malusi used to be on their side even like the way he is on their side right now.  He used to say he does not understand why people are always askingthe presence of the Gupta’s in South Africa because they are bringing the business in South Africa.   So he used to name which I do not recall which are those businesses that they used to bring but he used to say the Gupta’s are bringing business in the country.  He does not understand how South African’s think.So that happened.  So I even asked him on the day then I was like what is that?  He said no they are documents because they need to bring some of their family members so he was helping them.  So when he came back the documents were in the boot and he forgot even myself I forgot.  So in the morning he was looking for them in his office asking everywhere then I said I do not remember where is it.  But he was like I can leave it at home but I do not remember.  Then later he called when he was in the office he said no I found the document in the boot.  So that was – he was doing that. So he said he was helping them because they were bringing business in South Africa.      Yes.    So he was not upset that he was a Minister of Finance he was upset the fact that the President when he told him that he is going to become a Minister of Finance.  So he said the President was acting like it is coming from his heart and Malusi deep down he said he knows that the President did not want him to become a Minister of Finance. He wanted Brian Molefe to become a Minister of Finance.  So – so he was like I just do not even understand why he acts like he is giving me that portfolio because he did not want me.  So I do not know who suggested that Malusi must become the Minister of Finance.  And I remember the timeBrian was already in Cape Town.  He was staying in the – there was a residence for Parliamentarians yes at that time.  So Malusi was like I know why Brian was in the Parliament it is because he was preparing for his appointment as the Minister of Finance. So when the President appointed him he was like he thinks I do not know that I was not his first preference.    Do you want me to say something on that?   Oh okay.  Like…    Yes he said that.  He said the President wanted Brian to be the Minister of Finance not him.    Yes.    Yes.    Ye.    Yes I know because I drove that car almost a year and – but what I remember when that car we need to get the – the renewal of the disc – I think it was a year almost like two years when I was driving that car.  So I remember when that car needs to go to service or maybe wanted to get a disc and even the time when I was    I drove it I think a year and a half or almosttwo years.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  And then when I drop it off I drop it off at his friend’s place.  But I do not know why I took pictures of it when I was standing there at his place in Sandton and then when the Hawks took my gadgets so those are the kind of the pictures also that were deleted. All the pictures of thatcar are deleted on my phone    Ja there were people who know that I was driving the car.    It was in my name but very short it was changed out of my name then it was registered on hisfriend’s name.  So when I was looking for it now I contacted the licence department so they told me that the soon the change of ownership of the car moves from the – this owner to another owner then everything just changed automatically to go another person.  So – because it was his friend. I do not know why Malusi changed the car from me to his friend.    Sorry.    Oh no he did not – I think a few months I was driving the car Malusi told me that he wants the car to be registered under his friend.    Yes and I asked him why so he said because the time – because his divorce dragged for too long.  So he said he does not want that car to be there because he was married in community of property so he wants – he does not want the car to be taken away from him so let us put it on his friend.  So then he did it.    Yes this is my version.  The only part that I was correcting on the old affidavit it was the word saying Malusi approved the neutralisation of the Gupta’s.    Yes.    Only that.    Yes.   Yes.    No Malusi was inviting his own people – I was inviting my own people.    It is him because those are his people not me.    I know that the President was invited.  The reason I remember that it is because when we were in Durban two days before my wedding we were doing rehearsals and then they told us that the security peoplethey need to come and do sweeping so we need to move away from the venue and then they did that – even the following day they did that.  So when he did not come so I asked Malusi why the President did not come to the wedding because there were a lot of preparations for him to come.   On that one the reason I know that they gave him money I asked him like – because you were so close –because during – in 2014 Malusi and the Gupta’s were very close.  So it was very shocking to me that people that are so close that they have like a very close relationship they are not attending your wedding.   So I asked him why they did not attend the wedding then he said they said they are going to give him a gift – cash money as the compensation of them not attending the wedding.  So I knew that the Gupta’s were not coming to the wedding and they were going to give him cash.  The only person I did not know that he was not coming until the wedding day it was the President.   Yes.    So I will explain as the way I explained in the beginning.  So …   Yes.    Yes.    He did not say that?  You saying that.    Because I said on the interview that I saw Malusi taking money at home and it was the same bag that he came with it at the Gupta house.    I have never seen them giving him money and that is what I said it in the interview.    But what you – used to happen when we –when we arrive Malusi will not take his bag with him inside.  So then we will leave our phones.  Then some – when you were about to leave Malusi will come – go take his phone and call one of his protectors – protectors he will say Chief please bring my bag. So the protector will bring the bag.  Malusi will go in with the bag and when we leave Malusi will take the bag with him.   So that time I did not know what was inside – what was happening but one – there was this one day we were at home and we came from the Gupta’ house and then quicklywhen I get home Malusi went to his study.  Then I quickly went to check the child.  When I got there the nanny was telling me that the child is sick.   So I checked the temperature.  Then I felt the temperature was too high.  Then I rushed to him.  When Iwas there I saw him packing the money and then I was like – so I was shocked when I saw a lot of money.  Malusi was packing it because his safe was open.  Then I asked him I was like where do you get a lot of money – why so much money?   Then – then he shouted at me. He was like why I did not knock. I did not understand why I have to knock at home at our own home.  Then he kept on shouting like why you did not knock when you come in – in the house.  Then I was like the child is sick.  Where do you get this money?  Why thismoney then he was like I got it from the Gupta’s.  Because it was the same bag.   Then I was like why the Gupta’s are giving you so much money?  He said it was for the elections.  So he is going to take it and he give it to – to the Treasury of the ANC. Then I was like what is it for?   Then he said there are things that they need to do.  Sometimes they buy t-shirts.  So he explained like that.  But I did not know how – I even – I remember when I asked it was like so why are have to raise this money yourself?  Thenhe said like this is the nature of the ANC as the head of elections you used to raise money.  So the money for the elections.  And then after that he said he is coming.  He could – need to pack the money then I left. Then after that we take the child to the hospital.   Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    From the Gupta compound.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct.    Also when this incident happened in Sandtonit was not only me alone.  His body guards also were there.    Yes I confirm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   The one that I saw him packing at home from the bag that he came out with from the Gupta house.    He said to me he was – he got that money from the Gupta’s.    And I asked him what was it for.  He said it was for elections.   Yes.    We were in Sandton.   Yes.    So we were coming from the Gupta’s house.  It was me, him and his protectors so then the money – there was a bag in the boot.  So when Malusi came at the front because they used to open both of us – Malusi was on the outside – I was on the other side.  Then Malusi went in the boot and then he opened the big bag.     That is the – the bag was coming from the Gupta’s house and then he took the money he put it – and his body guards were there also.  It was not only me.  And it was this stash of cash.    Yes.    No.      So what used to happen. It will be a big bag.    Okay Chairperson.  So it used to be a big bag that it will come out of the Gupta house then it will go in the boot.  So the two instances I remember at home Malusi was packing the money from that big bag that was coming fromthe Gupta house and he confirmed to me that he was given that money by Ajay for the elections.  The second time it was in Sandton.  So he took the money from the big bag to a small bag.  So wherever he goes Malusi used to have like a sling bag that is small.  So he did not take that whole entire big bag.  He took the money – he put it on the small bag and then he took some of it he gave to his protector.  He said he must go and pay for his suits.  And sometimes when we are in Sandton we will go have lunch and then he will ask his body guard please go pay for my suits.  So used to go payfor the suits.  So most of the time the money will already on his name bag which means he will put at home before he comes.  Not like all the time he would do the transfer from this bag.    Okay.    That I saw the money from the big bag transferred.    It was once.    It was a couple of times.    From his small bag.    The sling bag that he used to carry.    He only – the bag that he used to carry.    That is what I am saying.  It was not all time he would transfer the money from the big bag because sometimes we will leave from Pretoria to Sandton.  It was not all the time we will leave from the Gupta compound. Because sometimes we will just leave from home going to Sandton.  Malusi will say let us go have lunch in Sandton or sometimes we will go do our facials in Sandton.  So when we do that he would already have the money in the bag. I do not understand – do you understand me?    It depends if my …   Yes is available – she is available.  If she is available I will come.

ADV QOFA SC:  Chairperson depending on the allocations of time I think maybe if we and I would understand for the hour that we would be able to finish.     The suggestion Chairperson was that we will finish – we need another hour.    So I was trying to understand whether the time we need for tomorrow will be the hour that (talking over one another)     And maybe if I may ask Chairperson what time in the morning are we looking at so that I would have to reshuffle immediately.
