CHAIRPERSON:Good morning Ms Butheleze, good morning everybody.    Yes are you ready?    Okay.    With regard to matters that relate to departments within the provincial government where – which have their own legaladvisors did the need – was the need for those departments to send contracts to the Legal Advisors in the office of the Premier based on insufficient experience or capacity or expertise or was the position that the legal advisors in those departments were in themselves – were themselves experienced people with the required expertise but therewas some other reason why they were nevertheless required to submit contracts to the legal advisors in the office of the Premier?    Who issued the directive?    So you say although you were not party to the decision to issue that directive but you say on your own you are able to say that there were certain capacity challenges at least in regard tosome departments and from that point of view you would have seen the directive as maybe a way of trying to assist with capacity?    Yes okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Is that paragraph 2.4 of his affidavit?    That is in Exhibit HH2?   May I take you back to page 29 that is the letter from Advocate Ditira.  I see that she I think you said it is a she or am I wrong?    Ja that she writes below her name DDG Legal Services.  Now you said that your position is DDG Corporate Administration and something else.   Okay but you mention the components of your – of your job and they include legal services.    So I want to find out whether DDG Legal Services was that she was also occupying the position of DDG but her focus was just legal services or whether that was just meant to refer to relate to the office which you held because as I understand it she reported to you?    That is confusing.  On the one hand she is paid at the level DDG but the position she occupies and the functions of which she performs are at Chief Director Level.    So it is like you – it is like you perform the functions – let me make just an example of a clerk but you are paid at director’s level something like that?   But – does the Act not provide for a transfer to a higher position or a lower position depending on circumstances?    If it is to a higher position?    Ja no but I am talking about to an equal…    Position – of equal level that is fine.    But what I am asking is whether the does Act does not actually also allow transfer to a lower position and of course I think that has to be with your consent I take it?  But the other transfer maybe also has to be with consent but I know that in public service at least with regard to certain departments but maybe the whole public service you can be transferred even without your consent if it is considered to be in the public interest or something like that.    So – so therefore it cannot – it cannot be that it is as if – if it is a transfer you can only be transferred to an equal position.  You can be transferred to a lower position as well.      Yes    Ja well I guess it a side issue.  It is a very strangething to me.    That your services are required at a lower position the functions that you perform the responsibilities are at a lower level not at a higher level.   But you are paid at a higher level.  Now you are not paid for the functions you perform you are paid for functions that you do not perform.    Yes.    Okay alright.    I am sorry Ms Butheleze I just want to complete what we were talking about.  But if the position that she then occupies in your unit is that of Chief Director is that not the designation that should appear in the letters that she writes?    Yes.    Yes.    Not DGG.    Because that is not – she does not occupy such aposition in your unit.    There is no such position in your unit?    Ja okay.     I am completing out discussion as I think about it – what we were talking about just now about the position for Ms Ditira.  It seems that actually legally it is quite risky for her to use a position that does not exist in the unit because if as Chief Director she has powers to make certain decisions and she is required to make those decisionsas Chief Director and she makes those decisions and writes DDG Legal Services a position that does not exist somebody who is adversely affected by that decision could challenge it on the basis that she exercised powers that she does not have because as – there is no position of DDG Legal Services.  She could only exercise powers thatare attached to Chief Director.    Yes    Yes    Yes.   Yes.  But if she gives legal advice also that legal advice is only supposed to be given in her position as Chief Director.    Not in any other position because there is no position called DDG Legal Services.    Hm.    I think you – I think there is a certain distinction youwant to make between what you did and suggesting that he delegate.  Now if you say I advised him to delegate that is very close to I suggested that he should delegate.  But I think what you seek to do is that what you want to say is that you gave advice that it is possible – that it was possible for him.  It was open to him to delegate if he wanted to.      That is what you want to say?    Okay.   Have you stated the principle correctly Ms Buthelezi?  You must be careful.   Ja, but it does not say what you say – what you say it says.    Does it – does it not mean that – well you – you have got to reflect very carefully if you are going to put it to – to a witness.    Certainly if the original power provides for delegation it can be done.  Okay.  So the option is whether there is provision in the legislation that if you are given this particular power you delegate because if there is such a provision obvious a delegation can happen.  The other situation is where there is no – no express provision in the legislation whether you can delegate if you are given power or not andthat is when some principle can come in and – and maybe it is not even a principle. It is – it might just be a presumption rather than a principle.  So – but all I am simply saying is just be careful how you put it.    I do not know if it is necessary to - to go there …    Because I do not know if he is giving evidence as an expert.    So - but you might have – might have to make up your mind whether you want to ask.  It just depends what you want to achieve.    I am sorry.  Where did you say we should go?    Okay.    Let me get the bundle first Ms Buthelezi.    Reference bundle what?    And what page?    I am going to adjourn.  Will somebody sort out this file please?  We adjourn.   Okay.  Let us proceed.    Ja.    No …    Yes.    No that is fine.   That is fine.    Okay.    Even the description of the parties on the first page.  It is just not on.    I mean a project cannot be a party …    To an agreement.  Who drafts this – this kind of agreement?    Ja.    1-3-4-0.    Is that 1340?   Yes.    But also the beneficiary was not a party to the agreement.  The beneficiary was a beneficiary …    And was said to represent a project you know or the project and then obligations are placed and rights are given to the beneficiary but ja.    Ja.    It was …    Yes.    Yes.    Did he explain to you why if he was not – did not have the delegation why he signed an agreement that said he was dulyauthorised because that is what it says on the first page?    Ja.    Well maybe this was – maybe this was a clear example that contracts in Government departments should not be finalised before they were sent to the legal advisors in the Office of the Premier.   If this is what was being done.    Oral advice.    Must we put away this – this file now?    Okay.    By that time the 99 Year Lease had already been signed?    Yes.    And it was on the – and it was – oh that was the one in terms of which the municipality was getting - what did you say - about a million Rand?    Oh.    Oh, okay.    Okay, okay.    Yes, okay.    Do you recall for how long the 99 Year Lease Agreement would have been running by that time – by March 2014 more or less?  Two year or anything like that?    About a year.    Yes.    Okay, thank you.    Is that the head of the department?   Yes.    Okay.    I heard evidence yesterday that in terms of the agreement that had been concluded with Estina – Estina was obliged to have made – to have – to have made a certain financial contribution tothe project but that it never made any payment.  So if that is factually correct I am wondering whether the department should have made the – the payments or acknowledge any obligation to make any payments to Estina.    But of course the department would not have to pay Estina for even services that it may have received from Estina if Estina owed the department an equal amount or even more.  Is it not? My – my recollection from yesterday’s evidence was that Estina was meant to make a contribution of about R200-and something million into the project and the department was meant to make a contribution of R300-and something million into the project but that thedepartment made its contribution and Estina did not make any contribution and from what appears at page 36 what the department was saying the department was acknowledging that it owed Estina 6 252 000.  Obviously an amount that is less than the amount that Estina is supposed to have paid into the project.   Well maybe I do not understand.  You and I go decide to do a project and we agree that for this project we will put in respective amounts.  I put my amount.  You do not put any amount. Whatever services you are doing are meant to be in terms of this agreement as I understand.  You must tell me if my understanding is correct. How can you – how can you be entitled to me paying you anything in terms of this agreement when you have not performed in terms of this agreement in terms of the money that you must put in and I am the only one who has been funding this?    Yes.   I am trying to just understand.    Yes.    Was Estina’s obligation to make – to make – to pay its contribution?  Was that obligation supposed to be performed or carried out at the end of the project?    Is your understanding that this R106 million was actually paid to Estina?   Eventually?    Yes.  Okay, well if – if - the legal team may or may not have looked into the issue but if it has not it should look into the issue whether in these circumstances Estina should have been paid that amount.  It may be that …    It may be that it should have been paid.  It may be that it should not have been paid but I think we have an obligation totake a position on whether the department had any obligation to – to pay that amount in these circumstances.    Okay, alright.    Well I had the occasion some time back to look at – in the context of evidence in the Commission to look at what I was told was the legislation that gives the FDC powers to do certain things or its - which contains its mandate.  So I do not know if you were looking at the same but what I do recall about that legislation is that what issupposed to be stated as the functions is stated as objectives and what is stated as – as objectives are supposed to be stated as functions.  Is that the same legislation you looked at?    Okay.    Is that 2.13?    Okay.    Yes.    Oh that is – that is where it comes from?    That is where it comes from?    Ja.  I think the – the problem is that there is - probably there should be a reference to the kind of situation you are talking about because when one reads it the way it stands it seems to be wide enough for a situation where maybe there was not proper planning …   First impression that you know you embarked upon a project without checking whether you have got funds …    But one can understand the kind of situation you are talking about.  It may be that you know your team could think about whether it is formulated in the best way or not but that is really your – your own decision.    No thank you.  Are you done?    Yes.  No thank you very much Mr Venter.  You are excused.  Thank you for coming to give evidence to the Commission and to share with the Commission the experiences you have had and the role you played in regard to the advises that you gave and your unit gave in regard to this matter.    Thank you very much.    Yes.  I take it that the legal team of the Commission has had a chance to have a look at all the documents that you say youare keeping or at least copies of documents that were taken by the Hawks to see whether there are no documents there that are relevant for us.  Do you know whether that has happened?    Ja.    Ja.    Okay.  If the legal team could check all of thosedocuments to see whether there is not something that is important for our purposes.    Okay.  Thank you very much Mr Venter you are excused.  We will take the tea adjournment now.  It is 26 past 11.  We will resume at quarter to 12.  We adjourn.    Ms Gcabashe?   Morning.    Okay, the file containing the affidavit of Mr Ephraim Makhosini Dhlamini will be marked as Exhibit HH4.    Are we going to use an interpreter today?    Yes.  Miss Interpreter are you the same interpreter that was sworn in last week?    Yes, so you are duly sworn?    Yes, okay thank you.  We are going to administer the oath or affirmation and the interpreter will interpret the oath.  Please stand interpreter.    Thank you.    Well if Mr Dhlamini needs an interpreter him looking at that statement is not going to help, it would have to be the interpreter who looks at the statement and then helps him in terms of interpreting, isn’t it?    Oh you just want to confirm that – his signature?    Yes I take it that because he signed a statement that is in English that his position is that he does understand English and does understand what the statement says but for purposes of his evidence, he prefers to use another language?    Well then there is something wrong with the statement, because the statement doesn’t say it was read to him, it’s him speaking English in this statement.    Yes so if he doesn’t understand English then it means what should have been done is that there should have been, either astatement in isiZulu that he made and then somebody else translated that statement into English or there should have been an interpreter certificate that says, I interpreted this statement from that to that from that paragraph to that paragraph to him into isiZulu and this is what he confirmed, but if it is in English and he signs it then it’s not correct.   Yes.    Okay I’ll adjourn for a short while then you’ll let me know once you are ready, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNED INQUIRY RESUMES    Are you able to proceed?    Okay.    Yes let’s do it that way.    Thank you.   I understand okay, alright.    Ms Gcabashe I hope I didn’t miss this, you might wishto  just take care of evidence like where he lives, because the beneficiaries are supposed to be people who live in a certain area, where he lives and his connection with the project before we going into contact with the Hawks and so on, you might wish to consider doing that.   Yes I always look for the connection with the witness first so – because then after that one knows, who is this one, how does he come into this, yes proceed.    More or less, how many member does the African Farmers Association have or the Vrede chapter of the African Farmers Association have?    Thank you.    Well maybe let me say there may have been ahundred people there we don’t want you to mention all of them so just those that you think, in terms of the roles they played are important then you can indicate that they were – so there were others and you can give an indication of the number if you are able to say, well from the community maybe there must have been about 30 or 40 or whateverpeople, you don’t need to mention each and every one of them.    I’m sorry, Philemon, did you say Philemon Ngwena or Philemon Nkwena?    Okay and I don’t know if Ngwena and Nkwena mean the same thing so maybe (laughter).    When was the – when was this meeting if you are able to remember?    Okay thank you.   Yes.    Yes.    No that is fine.    Before we go further into the second meeting can I take you back to the first meeting?  You told me that Mr Zwane spoke but you did not tell me whether there was anybody from the Farmer’sAssociation who also spoke at the meeting.  So I would like to know whether there was anybody who spoke on behalf the Farmer’s Association and any other person who spoke on anything that you consider to have been important.    Thank you very much.   Well I do not know if it is going to be important but you have said two things.  You said you believe or trust that he wasthere and you have said you know that she was there.  It cannot be both.  It has got to be one.  Did you see her at the meeting therefore if you saw her you know that she was there.  If you did not see her you may believe that she was there because there were many people who were there but you do not know.  So which of the two is it?    Okay.    Okay no before you proceed I think Ms Gcabashe would like to repeat her question.  You might have misunderstood the question.    Maybe it is the convenient time.    Does it look like we might go up to five o’clock today?    Yes.    Yes. Ja.   Yes.    Yes.   Okay.  Okay.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at two.  We adjourn.    Are we ready?    Thank you.    Okay.  I am – I am sorry – I am sorry.  Before he – he responds.  I think the interpreter did not understand the question correctly.  You might wish to just repeat.   What was Mr Mahlaba Chairperson of?    You mentioned three people a few minutes ago which included I think is it Mr Mahlaba or (coughing)?    Yes.    Yes.  Was he among the three people that you mentioned a few minutes ago when you said you elected three people?    Was he the Chairperson of the committee that was made of those three people?    What did you call that committee?    So they might not have had a specific formal name as a committee but they represented your interest in the dairy project?    Thank you.    Well the …  Yes.Just so that there – there is no misunderstanding.  Do you confirm that those who owned red meat cattle if they sold their cattle or any of their cattle they would only get more shares in the dairy project if they bought cattle for the dairyproject?  In other words – in other words they would not just sell their cattle and then get more – more shareholding. They would have to add – they would have to buy dairy cattle and add them to the dairy project.    Ms Interpreter …    I think your interpretation is very good but there -there is a part which I think you might not have got correct.  It is not my understanding that he is saying it was suggested to them that they should sell their cattle.  My understanding is that he is saying it was an option which they could …    Use if they want to or not use.    Okay.  I must have complete misunderstood.  I do not know about Ms Gcabashe but …    Yes.    Okay, okay.    Okay.  So – so just so that I understand.  In terms of what they told you that is now as I understand Mr Mosebenzi Zwane interms of what he told you was it possible for somebody who had red meat cattle to become a beneficiary in the dairy project without selling his or her cattle?    Okay.  So in the end those who had red meat cattle were not compelled to sell their red meat cattle in order to have shares in the dairy project?    Okay.  Is that what Mr Motaung said at the first meeting or is it your interpretation of what was said that you are telling me?    Thank you.  Ms Gcabashe.    Mr Dhlamini please listen very carefully to the questions and try and answer just that question that is being asked. MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through    Okay.  Please proceed.    But I just want to say again Mr Dhlamini I know it is in the afternoon.  Just listen carefully to the question as interpreted to you by the interpreter and try and just answer that question.  If Ms Gcabashe wants to ask you about something else she will ask youbut just answer that question.  If you keep on not answering the question and giving evidence about other things we will take much longer to finish. MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through    Maybe I can just ask and maybe it is the samequestion you are going to ask, did Mr Sabenzi Zwane have a music choir before this dairy project was started?    I think his father was pastor.    So before this dairy project started Mr Sabenzi Zwane had a music choir that he had and are you saying that, that is the choir that he took to India instead of taking the farmers to India for training?    Maybe you want to take it from there?    Yes, I assume that he didn’t take the choir to India for – to have them trained as farmers?    Yes but my question is, were they taken to India for the same purpose for which the farmers would have been taken there, namely training as farmer? MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through    Okay thank you.    I’m sorry, I’m sorry to interrupt I know that at some stage earlier he was moving into tell me about the second meeting after having spoken about the first meeting and I see that the part that you are talking about relates to, according to his statement the third meeting.  I wonder whether it wold not be convenient to make sure we are done with the second meeting but if, in terms of themes that part belongs to a theme that fits more with what we have dealt with that’s fine but it would help me more if we finish with the first meeting, we go to the second meeting and then third meeting.   So we have dealt with it?    Okay maybe I can just ask a few questions, maybe Imight have missed something.  Do you recall more or less when it was that you had the second meeting where, I believe Mr Zwane addressed you again?    The first meeting was in 2012, I take it that the second meeting was also in 2012?    Yes and was it held at the same venue as the first meeting?    And was it essentially the same people who attended even if it’s not really everybody?   Yes okay thank you.    And it was not long after the second meeting that you had the third meeting, is that correct?   Okay thank you.    Okay let me just check, what you had heard was it that the Government in Pretoria wanted the list – wanted a list of beneficiaries or is what you heard that the Government in Pretoria wanted the ID’s of the beneficiaries?   Okay, is what you had heard therefore, that theGovernment in Pretoria wanted a list of the names of the beneficiaries or is what you had heard that the Government in Pretoria wanted the ID’s – ID books of the beneficiaries, or both?    No Mr Dhlamini, I’m asking you again, please just listen to the question and answer that question and other issues that you might wish to tell me which you have included in your statementthat Ms Gcabashe knows about, she will ask you about those issues in due course.  Okay, earlier on you said you had a caucus meeting with your members is that correct? MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through    And you said that you told them that they should not hand up their ID books, is that correct?    And you said that you had heard something and I thought that you said that you heard that the Government in Pretoriawanted a list of the beneficiaries but the interpreter seems to have said, you said you heard that the Government in Pretoria wanted the ID books, so that is why I was asking you to clarify what you heard.    Okay that’s what you had heard, namely the Government in Pretoria wanted the names of the beneficiaries?    Okay thank you.  If you had told me that, what five minutes ago, we would have covered a lot more ground now.     Okay, alright thank you.    Did your members reject the idea of not giving their ID books or – at the caucus meeting?    Oh okay, but when you went to the meeting then they gave their ID books for – to be copied?    And then you did the same?    Okay.    Okay let us just get this clear.  You see it is important to give me a clear picture as to what happened in a particular meetingand we close that off and move onto something else.      Let me ask a few questions. 1.  Who called the third meeting?    So please just repeat the two names of the people who called the meeting?    Who were they in the whole scheme of things?    So they were government officials from the Department?    Now you told us with regard to the first meeting that what was written in the article that Ms Gcabashe read was true namely that the way the first meeting was called was by way of people who went around with I think loud-halers saying there would be a meeting. Is that how the third meeting was also called?    Yes.  And at the meeting, the third meeting was it Ms Meyer – was it only Ms Meyer who was the speaker?    Are you now saying Ms Meyer was one of the speakers but there was another speaker Ms Kobene is that what you are saying?   And this third meeting was it called as a follow-up meeting in relation to the dairy project?    Okay.  This meeting was called as a meeting relatingto the dairy project?    The third meeting.    Yes thank you.    Thank you.   Before you tell us about the fourth meeting.  What Ms Gcabashe was trying to establish from you with regard to the last sentence of paragraph 17 is this.  What Ms Gcabashe was trying to establish from you in regard to the last sentence of paragraph 17 is the    Okay.    And maybe just to put you at ease it may be that in the end it does not matter whether it was in the second meeting or first meeting what is important is were there forms that you signed and what those forms were?  So do not worry much about that.      And who called the Imbizo?    Yes.    And Mr Zokwana was Minister of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries.  Is that the one you are referring to?    What – I am sorry.  What was your understanding of what Mr Zokwana was referring to that he seems to have found objectionable in the words that you had used?    Oh is that what Mr Thabethe said he would sort out or did MR Thabethe say he was going to resolve the difficulties that you had raised with Mr Zokwana?    Just again I know you said it about two minutes ago.  What exactly was the problem that you told Mr Zokwana about regarding the Vrede dairy project?    Criminal activity.    Yes and so is – is that what Mr Thabethe said he was going to resolve then?    Now I know that you said you cannot remember around about when the Imbizo was held but if you think back at the time when the third meeting was held and you look at the time when Imbizowas held about how much time would you say lapsed between Imbizo between the time that the third meeting had happened before the Imbizo was held?    More than a year?    Okay thank you.    And the – Mr Thebethe that attended that meeting that you talking about is it the one who was the Head of the Provincial Department of Agriculture in the Free State?    And Mr Senzeni Zokwana did not attend the Imbizo?    Thank you.    I am sorry.  I am sorry.  I think the interpreter might not have understood your question.  I think Ms Gcabashe wanted to establish from you whether you are saying at the time of this meeting what you learnt was that the FDC had already taken over not that it was going to take over ultimately.  Okay.  I will put the question. At this meeting was your understanding that the FDC had already taken over as opposed to it will still – it will take over ultimately.    Whatever meeting they were talking about.    Oh, okay.  Ja.  Her question was about I think whether before it had – before the meeting it had already done so.  That was my understanding at least of the meeting – of the question but at least you are clarifying that it was still to take over.    The tense can make a big difference in meaning.   Okay.  Ms Gcabashe I think I may have thought that the interpreter misunderstood the question but she – she might have heard the question correctly.  Are you asking what knowledge he had at the time he was attending the meeting or are you asking whatknowledge he gained after the meeting as to the role of the FDC?    Yes, okay.  Now I understand it.  It is all about – it is all about tense.  Now I understand.  Okay but you do not remember the date when you found out that the FDC had taken over but are you able to indicate how soon after the fourth meeting it was that you learnt thatthe FDC had taken over?    Okay.  Let me – you say you or I understand that you might not recall the date when exactly you might have heard that the FDC had taken over.  Do you want to interpret that part; but are youable to say how long after the fourth meeting you learnt that the FDC had by then taken over?    And just before you say that can you – you deal with that.  Can you just tell me again whether Ms Meyer was employed atthe Office of the Premier or whether she worked for the Department of Agriculture or where she worked?    That is where – that is where she worked in the Office of the Premier?    Okay.  When you say she was from the Premier’s Office is that because of what she told or whether you also know as afact that she worked in the Premier’s Office?    Thank you.  Then you can deal with the fifth meeting.    Yes.    Okay.   Okay, thank you.    I am sorry before he does so I normally take a short break at four if we are going to go beyond four.  So maybe we should take that.  Just 10 minutes.    So …    Ja. We will adjourn and then we will resume at 10 past four.  We adjourn.    Okay, let’s proceed.    What was your understanding of who she was referring to as making noise like a frog that had to be ignored?    Okay, what had you been told was the purpose of that meeting with her?    Okay.    Do you mean your meeting with Dr Masiteng happened the day before your meeting with Mr Maimane?    Thank you.    Okay I am sorry, I thought earlier on you said Mr Tudo said to you Dr Masiteng and Mr Modiba were calling you, did Ihear you correctly?    Oh it’s the third one that you don’t remember?    Okay thank you.    When you were called, when Mr Tudo said DrMasiteng and Mr Modiba were calling you were you inside the premises of the Department of Agriculture?    And the two who you were told were calling you were they outside of the room where you were and other farmers were?    Had they been in the same room where you and the other farmers were but they left the room before you were called?    When Mr Tudo told you that were the two men, Dr Masiteng and Mr Modiba inside the room where the meeting was to be held or were they already outside?    Okay, thank you.    Well there is something that must have been discussed between you on the one hand and them on the other before you reached that point, because they are the ones who had called you isn’t it?    But you must have asked them why did you call me, and I assume they would have told you, did you not ask them why did you call me and if you did what did they say to you?    Were they therefore not calling you as the leader of the farmers association in Vrede to discuss with you the suggestion that the meeting should move to a bigger place?   Thank you.    Okay before we get into that meeting let’s go back tothe time when you were with the three men outside the room where the meeting was going to be held initially.    I just want you to be sure that this is not a case where maybe you can’t recall what they said because it doesn’t seem to make sense that they called you and you did not ask why did you call me but you talked about them calling you names and then you went back into the room.  Are you sure you remember exactly that they did not say anything to you about why they had called you?   So did the four of you just look at one another outside there and said nothing and then you went back?   I’m sorry, I missed something, I think you said they were calling you something, I didn’t hear, what were they calling you?    You are?    DA, they were saying you are a DA member?    Oh, okay.  Oh okay.    Oh okay, is that the reason why you were telling them that you would remain a member of the ANC?    Oh, okay.  But you earlier on you said you only heard later or maybe I misunderstood, did they say when you were themoutside that venue, that the meeting should shift to another place, a bigger venue, did they say that there or did they not say that?    Okay, thank you.    Yes.      It sounds like sleeping on the wheel.      Or on the job.  Ja.  Was your understanding that when they said that they were admitting that they had not done things the right way with regard to the project?   Okay.    Now after they had admitted that they had slept on the job and that they should have done exactly what you were suggesting should have been done what was the way forward that was agreed upon at the meeting if there was any way forward that was agreed upon?    Are you sure about that because I would have thought that if there is a project that is going on and there is dissatisfactionand everyone acknowledges that certain things have not been done right I would have thought that there would also be a focus on how do we correct the mistakes that we have made.    Okay.    Okay take your time to ask him to explain any equipment that you do not know.    You can use that – you can use that term just as he uses it.    Yes the – and that still during the – Mr Maimane’s visit you observing this during that time?    We – we have gone past five o’clock.  Your learned friends have not helped you with telling you the time.    We had planned to stop at five.  So we are going tostop now. I understand that Mr Dhlamini’s available to come back tomorrow morning.  Let us confirm that?    Okay thank you.  So we will adjourn now and tomorrow do we start at ten or would you like us to start a little earlier?    Would help.    Okay let us start at half past nine then tomorrow.     So we start at half past nine tomorrow.  Okay we will adjourn and tomorrow we will start at half past nine.  We adjourn. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Good morning Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair before I proceed today there are just a few things that I need to clarify from yesterday’s evidence with Mr Venter.  Mr Venter the first issue that I wish to clarify is that in yourevidence yesterday you said there were about 600 people at Premier’s office in the Free State.  I want to understand what do these people do?    Okay.  And is this historical or it only came – it only became a case when programme 4 was introduced?   Okay.  And the other issue that I wanted to clarify with you is the issue of the Department giving the office of the Premier or using the office of the Premier when they need to draft contracts.  I want to understand do different departments in the province have their own legal advisors or legal departments?    Yes and what sort of or type of contractsthen get to be drafted by your office and which contracts do they draft themselves?    Okay and yesterday when we parted you were dealing with the opinion that you gave to the municipal manager – Phumalele Municipality Mr Moremi.  In the case of municipalities do they also have their own legal advisors?  What sort of matters getreferred to your office by the municipalities?    Thank you Chair. Let us proceed.  On paragraph 2.4 you talk about a further opinion or clarification that you gave to Mr Moremi regarding…    Yes.  Of his – of your affidavit yes sorry Chair.      Yes on page 2 of that – of Exhibit HH2 and you attach that clarification as an annexure – Annexure D.  Would you please just tell us what – what were you saying in that clarification?    Yes.    Yes and do you know if the – your opinion was followed?    You talk about the draft Lease Agreement between the Free State Department and Phumalele local municipalityon paragraph 2.5 of your statement.    Paragraph 2.5 of your affidavit it is on page 2.    Yes.  Is this the agreement that was prepared in your office?    Thank you Chair.  This agreement betweenthe Phumalele Municipality and the Free State Government who are supposed …    Thank you Chair.  If we may proceed then?  We still on point 2.5 of your affidavit.  If it is an agreement between this – the Provincial Government and the local Municipality who should be the signatories of that particular agreement?    Thank you Chair.  Now I just want to add onyour questions now.  Mr Venter do you know how long did she stay with the Department of Economic Development?    Thank you Chair.  Then let us go back toyour affidavit.  You were saying if it is between the local municipality – Phumalele Municipality and the Free State Department or Free State Provincial Government it was supposed to be signed by a municipal manager and the Premier.  In this instance what happened?    So the drafts that you did was for the Premier and the – for the Premier to sign and the Municipal manager to sign?    Yes.  On paragraph 2.6.    You deal with the delegation of authority that happened. Could you please just take us through those events?    If I may – if I may ask why did you suggest that the Premier should delegate.    Yes and with the MEC?   Yes.    Thank you Chair for the clarity and with regards to MEC how did it come about that he delegated to the HOD?    Mr Venter there is a principle that is widely known that a delegate cannot delegate further.  What then empowered the MEC to delegate further – to delegate further?    Yes.  It is – it is the principle of delegatus non potest delegare.    That is my – my sort of summary or myunderstanding of what it says.  That a delegate cannot …    Yes.    Thank you, thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    I understand Chair but may – may …   Thank you.  Was there law or legislation that was empowering the MEC now to delegate further to someone whois in a lower rank than he was?    Thank you.  Let us move on to paragraph 2.7 of your statement.  This is the second advice that you gave toMoremi relative to Section 16 of the Deeds Registry Act.  Could you please take us through this opinion that you gave to Mr Moremi?    To – it is – it is paragraph 2.7.    Yes and the – the said opinion you attach to your affidavit as Annexure E.  Annexure E appears from page 33 Mr Venter.    Thank you.  Do you have any knowledge then what happened to this agreement after you – your advice?    Thank you Chair.  More information withregards to that issue will be taken up with other witnesses.  Thank you Mr Venter.  Can we then move to paragraph 2.8 of your statement where you deal with the Beneficiary Agreement or agreements that were brought to you at some stage?  Do you remember when these agreements were brought to your attention?    And who brought this agreement to you – toyour office?    Yes and who drafted these agreements?    Yes.  I understand that at that stage youropinion was sought.  What was – if I may rephrase.  What was the reason for bringing this agreements to your attention?    Thank you Chair.  That agreement appears on reference bundle – reference Bundle C page 1333.  It is towards the end of that bundle page 1333.  Yes.  Could you please just take us tothe – those clauses that you were referring to?    Oh so – sorry Chair.    Reference Bundle C.  Reference Bundle C.    1333.  It is towards the end of the bundle.  I am advised it is the last document in the bundle.    Thank you Chair.  Chair I wish to apologise for the – the mess that has …    Was in – in your file.    Ours do not have.  We will separate this file during lunch break.    Yes.    Thank you so much Chair.    Mr Venter you were to refer to the Chair to the clauses in that beneficiary agreement that is appearing on page 1333 of reference Bundle A that where you were not comfortable with.    Yes 1340.    40 yes.    Yes and - and you said it was signed by someone who was a Chief Director at the time and not by the HOD?    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Then let us – let us move on then to – to the oral agreement that you gave to the HOD inparagraph 2 – 2.9.    Sorry, oral advice.  I am sorry.  I apologise sir.  Oral advice that you gave to the Head of Department Mr Thabethe.  You deal with that in paragraph 2.9 of your affidavit.    Yes.    Thank you.    Yes and – and that lease was between the Free State Government and Estina.  Is that correct?    The municipality was no longer involved at that stage?    Thank you and then which year was this when you – when you gave Mr Thabethe this oral advice?    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  You then in paragraph 2.10 you refer – you talk about the – the cancellation of an agreement.  This is the Estina and the Department of Agriculture Agreement that was concluded in 2012.  Can you just tell us about your involvement and the cancellation agreement?    Yes and then following the – the letter from the head of the department for cancellation who then instructed you to draft the cancellation agreement that is attached to your affidavit as Annexure F?    This agreement was prepared by yourself?    Thank you and what was the total value of the outstanding invoice?  That will be on – on Annexure A of the agreement on page 40 of 8-8-2.    Thank you.  The – the – you said the agreement between that involves FDC was drafted by your colleague.  Is that correct?    Who instructed you to draft that agreement – the FDC Agreement now?        We …    We are looking at this issue Chair and issue will be led in that regard, thank you.    Then let us move to the involvement of FDC.  Who – if I may ask we said it was the Exco that made a resolution that FDC should take over.  Is that correct?    Yes and what was the resolution saying. What was FDC supposed to do there?  To do what Estina had been doing?    Thank you and in your understanding what is the mandate of the Free State Development Corporation?  What does it do in the province?    Thank you Chair.  What would be your – your view on Mr Jankielsohn’s evidence that you heard yesterday that as a result of Exco appointing or recommending that FDC be the – should manage the – this dairy – dairy project.  It was – the Free State Government was paying an extra million a month because FDC had toemploy another implementing agent to operate on the farm.    Thank you and your reference to Exco in this regard you meant the Premier and all the MECs at the time.  Is that correct?    Thank you.    Yes and then on paragraph 13 you speak about what happened to the originals of the documents that you referred us to.  Could you please take us …?    Yes.  2.13.    Thank you.  Mr Venter is there anything that you would like to share with the Commission with regards to this project as a whole as to how it was introduced, handled and where it is at this stage?   It is 15.3.    Thank you Chair.  I have no further questions for Mr Venter.    Will do Chair. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson they are employees which are occupying posts in the structure which consists of the four programmes that I alluded to yesterday.  As I have indicated that there is a significant number of community development workers in the department which are – who are attached to programme 4 and those community development workers are distributed in municipalities, the ideal position is one per ward but we do not have sufficient funds to fillall the vacant posts but that is basically a link between the community and the department through programme 4 and the intervention unit in programme 4 to which I also referred yesterday.    Chair it is difficult for me to remember.  The community development workers were previously housed in the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the intervention unit was in the office of the Premier based – in programme 3 which consisted of both policy and planning and monitoring and evaluation.  Those two functions were separated at a certain point in time specifically because the one programme cannot monitor and evaluate the same programme so the idea was to create a separate programme who can independently also monitor the other three programmes in the office of the Premier.   Yes Chairperson.  Only the Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation does not have in-house or their own legal advisors.  All the other departments do have their own legal advisors.    Chairperson there was a directive in 2010 that all contracts should be submitted to the office of the state law advisors in the office of the Premier for the reasons that Ialluded to yesterday which I think prompted at least part of that decision.  But for instance if it is a repetitive contract for – if I can perhaps refer to a lease agreement which is a standard agreement and it is basically just a small set of information in that agreement that differs from lease to lease.  It is not necessary to be referred to us unless significant changes are required.    Chairperson some of the bigger municipalities do have legal advisors but I am also aware that the small municipalities in the province do not have their own legal advisors and there was an invitation to these municipalities from the Executive Council and the Premier that if they have legal problems that it could be referred to the State Law Advisors and we will assist them where we can and we are doing it up to today.    Chairperson at the point in time when the directive was issued it was my sense that there was a turnover of officials in other departments who occupied posts of legal advisors or legal administration offices and the capacity – there were certainly capacity issues.  I indicated yesterday that I personally noted signed contracts which does not protect the interest of government or where there are clauses such as the indemnity clause which were contrary to the provisions of the Public Finance Management Act and Iraised those concerns and I cannot say that my concerns that I raised prompted that decision.  I was not part of the decision making process before that directive was issued.  But there were definitely capacity problems.  It is better at this point in time but there are also in some departments where there are definitely capacity problems and as I have indicated one department does not have legal advisors at all.    Chairperson the directive was issued by the previous Premier Mr Magashule.  I was not present in the meeting but it was a meeting of heads of departments, accountingofficers, chief financial officers and heads of supply chain management and it was later on confirmed in a meeting of the Executive Council.    That is correct Chairperson.  That is how I perceived it at that time.    And I may just mention Chairperson it was not an isolated incident.  We have an electronic case management system through which we manage all the legal work that comes into our unit and I checked yesterday morning and since 10 we handled a 1,423 contracts.  So it is a continuous …   Obligation that we have.    Chairperson I assume that the legal advice that Advocate Ditira provided to Mr Moremi the MunicipalManager on the 23 July 2012 and I refer to Annexure C to my affidavit that that was communicated to the Head of Department and the MEC or either one of the two and they sought an appointment with me to discuss it and I met with both of them.  The issue which they raised with me was the fact that they required to have access to the farm to initiate the project as soon as possible.  At that point in time the largest portion of the farm as I understood it were let to farmers.  And those lease agreements had not expired at that time.  Advocate Ditira in her opinion paragraph 9 referred to it.  That is the Annexure C on AJV29 Chairperson.     And she referred to an email of 16 July 2012.  And if I remember correctly that email alerted the Department not to engage the farmers with a view to cancel those agreements.  We were concerned that it may be regarded as a repudiation.  That the repudiation would be accepted and there would be a claim for damages against the municipality which we wanted to avoid at all cost.  The further options that she referred to in the last paragraph of her opinion was not clarified and when I met with the MEC and the Head of the Department we discussed other options.  As I haveindicated in paragraph 4 of my letter and those options were firstly that there should be a lease agreement instead of the company leasing the land from the municipality the Department could enter into a lease agreement with the Municipality.  Once the lease agreements with the farmers expired which was not acceptable to the Department becauseof their need to as quickly as possible get down to the land or then in order to protect the municipality I proposed that the Department then enter into an agreement with the municipality in terms of which they or which the rights and obligations of the municipality in terms of the lease agreements are assigned and ceded to the Department so that the Department could engage with the farmers without any risk to the municipality.  In that meeting the Head of the Department was adamant that he would be able to convince the farmers to an early mutual termination of those agreements and I was not sure exactly he would do it but he was convinced.  And I was then requested to amplify theprevious advice which Advocate Ditira gave to the municipality and I did that in this letter that I wrote to the Municipal Manager.    Chairperson we – we prepared that Session And Assignment Agreement subsequent to this and it was provided to the Department and the municipality if I remember correctly.  I said there was a draft prepared.    Paragraph sorry?    Ja.   That is correct.    Yes she.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  Chairperson I may perhaps just explain.  I can understand the confusion for a short period sheoccupied the post of Chief Operating Officer in the Department of Economic Development and Environmental Affairs.  And at that post was traded at Deputy Director General in that Department.  There was then a decision to abolish that post and she was transferred back to our legal services component but she retained her rank.  Although sheoccupies up to today the post of Chief Director which is one post level below my own.  But her rank is that of a Deputy Director General and she is remunerated at that rank still.    Yes.    Chairperson yes.  The Section 14 of the Public Service Act which provides for a transfer also provides that if an official is transferred to a post which is lower than the official occupies at the stage of transfer the official will retain their benefits.  That is the – how the Act determines it should happen and that is why she occupies that rank.    Chairperson to a lower position in terms when you are transferred to a higher post that must be througha selection process.    If it is to a higher position.    Ja.   Yes.    Correct.   That is indeed correct Chairperson.    With the retention of your benefits of the post which you occupied immediately before the transfer.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja that is the effect of that provision.    That is the effect.    I totally agree with you Chairperson.    I mean I raised it with her.   Ja it is correct that.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    The lease agreement on behalfof the Free State Provincial Government was supposed to be signed in terms of the Free State Land Administration Act by the Premier.  After a decision was taken in consultation with the MEC for Public Works being delegated by the Executive Council and on behalf of the municipality by the municipal manager authorised by the council I presume.    Chairperson that is correct.    Although in terms of the job description of the job that she occupies there are no specific decision making powers.    And allocated to herself.  But I understand completely.    The argument which you make Chairperson.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chairperson I do not have a vivid memory of the time period but it was not long.  It was not long.    Chairperson I do not thing agreement was ever signed.  We did the draft but it was not signed.    Yes.   Yes.    Chairperson in my meeting with the Head of Department and MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development I indicated to them that in my view if the Free State Provincial Government will receive the responsibilities and the obligations in terms of the agreement which the municipality had with the farmers on the land that could fall within the definition of acquire inthe Free State Land Administration Act.  And if I am correct it means that the Premier must then take the decision to enter into that agreement in consultation with the MEC for Public Works as delegated.  And subsequent to our meeting in a meeting of the Executive Council when there was a break in the meeting I was requested by the MEC andthe Head of Department to meet briefly with the Premier and to explain that to the Premier.  Which I did and I also explained to the Premier that in terms of Section 5 of The Land Administration Act he is entitled to delegate that authority to a member of the Executive and that the member of the Executive is also authorised in terms of the same section of the act to delegate it to an official of government.  The Premier then indicated his willingness to delegate and he requested me to prepare the delegation for him but also to include in the delegation that it is done on the advice of the State Law Advisors which I included in that delegation.  I also then prepared a delegation from the MEC forAgriculture and Rural Development to the Head of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to enter into the agreement to assign the responsibilities from the municipality to the Free State Provincial Government.      No I did not suggest I advised.  I got a sense that he does not want to be involved and that is why I advised that it is possible that he can delegate.    The MEC also indicated that he will want to – he wants to delegate that to the Head of the Department who must deal – run with the process.    That is indeed correct.    Yes.    Chair if I remember correctly I indicated to him that he can also delegate.  It is authorised in terms of the Act and the indicated that he – that he so wished to do.    Chairperson, yes.  Section 1 of the Free State Land Administration Act provides that the Premier may subject to conditions and so on delegate to any member of the Executive Council the responsibility of the Premier in terms of this Act and then in terms of Section 5.2 of this Act it provides that the member of the Executive Council may then delegate to any official in the service of the Provincial Government.  So it is authorised expressly in the Act.  Chairperson in - in December 2012 I received a request for advice from Mr Moremi whosubmitted documents to me to advise him on.  When I read through the documents the documents that was perhaps in my affidavit wrongly - and I apologise for that - referred to a lease agreement.  It was not a lease agreement. It was a Cession and Assignment Agreement and that Cessionand Assignment Agreement ceded and made over all the rights of the municipality in respect of the farm to the Free State Provincial Government and I – when I read through it I immediately sensed that it was inconsistent with my previous advice in the letter that I gave on the structure that I proposed of the assignment of the agreement so that there could be an engagement with the farmers and the lease agreement could then be entered into between the municipality and the Free State Provincial Government. That initial advice was premised also on the fact that the municipality received an annual income from the lease agreements tomore or less a million Rand and given the fact that it was a small municipality they simply could not forfeit that in – income over any period of time but the documents that I was presented or provided with by Mr Moremi indicated that the cession and assignment was not for a limited period and that there was no compensation to the municipality in those documents and I advised him accordingly in my letter which is attached that it is inconsistent.    Chairperson at a very late stageand that was about more than a year after this letter I became aware that there was in fact a transfer of the property to the Free State Provincial Government and a 99 Year Lease concluded with Estina.  I was for a long period totally unaware of that.    Chairperson I cannot recall the exact date but it was towards the end of 2013.  When I say towards the end October to December.  I – I am not – I do not have the exact date anywhere in my records.    Chairperson it was Dr Masiteng – (coughing) my apologies.  He is an employee of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and if I remember correctly he occupied the post of Chief Director District Services and there were people with him and I cannot recall who it was.    Chairperson I do not know.  When they submitted it to me it was already drafted and signed.    Chairperson I – my recollection is that my opinion was – was sought on those beneficiary agreements which I was presented with.  I was also presented with a list of namesof other beneficiaries except the names that or the name that appear – appeared in the contract.  I very briefly looked at that contract and if I think back I am a bit embarrassed how he reacted. I was quite annoyed what I read and I expressed that in – in no uncertain terms to Dr Masiteng.  I noticed that on – he signed on behalf of the department and I asked him whether he was delegated.  He indicated not and I say you can thank heavens that you are not delegated because this agreement is not valid because you were not properly delegated. The problems that I just picked up from a very cursory glanceat the agreement was that it was not clear what was transferred to the beneficiary.  It just referred that the project is transferred and how the other beneficiaries will fit in.  At that stage they were not in a cooperative or a company.  It was just individuals but it also contained clauses that the beneficiary may dispose of the assets of – of the project. So I said to them if these beneficiaries now decide to sell these profits or the project assets which you spent a lot of money on tomorrow in terms of this agreement they can do it.  So I said to them that that agreement is totally, totally inappropriate for the purpose Ithink that they wanted to use it for and they left my office.  We had no further discussion then on the Beneficiary Agreement.    Chairperson the – the first part of the agreement completely did not fit into the project as it was constructed at that time.   Indeed Chairperson.    Yes.    Chairperson I have no idea.    But what really concerned mewas paragraphs 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 on page 1-3-4 of the reference bundle – 1-3-4-0.    8.2 starts with the beneficiary shell and then 8.2.2 provides for sell dispensary placing encumber seat signed transfer and so on, project assets and then 8.2.3 use consume alienate sell.  Although there was a rider that it must be approved by the department I thought that it was extremely risky to include such clauses in this agreement given the situation on the ground where a beneficiary is now authorised to deal with the project assets in a certain way.   Yes.    Chairperson the – the bottom line is …    It was totally …   Inappropriate …    For the purpose it was crafted for.   That is correct.  At least when you dispose of assets in a department it had to be done by the accounting officer and I specifically requested Dr Masiteng whether he was delegated and he indicated no.    Chair to my embarrassment I did not.  I was fairly upset as I indicated and it was wrong from me …    to – to be upset and did not do my work properly because I was really annoyed.    Indeed Chairperson.    Indeed.    Chairperson the Head of theDepartment Mr Thabethe sent to my office a draft memorandum which he intended to submit to the Executive Council in which it was requested that the Executive Council approve the cancellation of the agreement between the department and Estina.  If I remember correctly it was the day before the Executive Council sat or the morning before it sat and I just very briefly looked at it and I realised that it only referred to one agreement. At that time I was already aware of the 99 Year Lease and I proposed to him that the amendment should be made that the memorandum should reflect that all agreements between thedepartment and Estina be cancelled specifically which I had in my mind was the 99 Year Lease which was encumbering the land.    Indeed Chairperson it had.   It had been signed.    No Chairperson that 99 Year Lease …    Did not make provision for any compensation …   For the lease period.    That is correct.    No.  At that point in time the municipality transferred ownership of the land to the Free StateProvincial Government.  Chairperson it was inMarch 2014.  If I remember correctly.    It was about a year Chairperson.    If I remember correctly …    That 99 - the transfer and the 99Year Lease were registered against the title deed of the property early in 2013.    Chairperson – (clearing throat) apologies.  As far as the cancellation letter was concerned thememorandum to the Executive Council indicated that the department lost the grant from the National Department of Agriculture and that as a result of that especially over the – the period for which the contract with Estina was supposed to – to last they are unable to – to fund their obligations in terms of that agreement and they requested permissionfrom the Executive Council or approval from the Executive Council to cancel the - the agreement. The Executive Council approved that and I was approached by the head of the department to assist to do the necessary paperwork to cancel the agreement.  I prepared the cancellation letter specifically using the paragraph which was referred to yesterday.  15.3 of the agreement – the July agreement between Estina and the department but I crafted the letter in such a way that I kept doors open for a possible review application for the initial contract as well as a review application for the 99 Year Lease.We had a brief discussion amongst us as legal advisors and we thought that at that point in time that the review application in order to get out of the agreement with Estina was a bit risky.  The appropriate functionary in terms of the Act approved the deviation and he was adamant that he had sufficient grounds and we did not think that we would get cooperation for him to be an applicant in a review application. He would probably be a respondent and it would have created problems.  I – we have also protracted legal process.    Indeed, yes.    Yes Chairperson.    So we opted to invoke thepositions of Clause 15.3 as the cancellation method to – to cancel this agreement and I crafted the letter, forwarded it to the head of the department and he must have sent it off to Estina because in April a letter was sent to my office by the head of the department in which Estina accepted the cancellation.    Chairperson – Chairperson Imay perhaps just add to give some context to what happened was that in the acceptance of the cancellation by Estina they indicated that there was a certain amount due and owing to them based on invoices already submitted to the department.  I engaged with - with the head of the department and he said - sent a set of invoices to me that he has received from Estina. It was basically a composite statement referring to invoices which were submitted to the department earlier more or less on a monthly basis and I realised that it – that if you look at the amount due that we will have to have an agreement to formalise that part of Clause15.3 about compensation for the work done up to the point of cancellation of suspension of the agreement and I then with the information provided by the department prepared that agreement.  Indeed Chairperson.Theresolution of the Executive Council also provided that the Free State Development Corporation should take over the management of the farm and due to the urgency which I thought it required I did the one agreement and my colleague Advocate Swanepoel did the FDC Agreement.    Chairperson the information is contained on page AJV36 in paragraph 1.2 of that agreement.  It wasR106 252 652.    Yes.    Chairperson I cannot recall that we had specific instructions.  It was just to give effect to the – to the resolution of the Executive Council and to make sure that there iscontinuity in the management of the farm when the agreement with Estina was cancelled.    Chairperson yes it – it – I think you are correct.  At that point in time I was not aware whether any payments were made.  As I have indicated I received a set of invoices and I requested the department to just compile it into one document that could be attached to the cancellation agreement instead of separate invoices but my understanding was that these invoices relatedto work that was already done. So for value which the department has received at that point in time.    Yes.  Chairperson Estina – the contribution of Estina if I understood it was towards the completion of the project and its entirety.  The R106 million was for what was actually constructed on the ground for which the department – of which the department will now receive the benefit upon consolation.  Estina was not supposed to receive any benefits subsequent to – to the cancellation in respect of project assets.    Chairperson I will try and explain.    My understanding was …    Yes.    That both parties had to make acontribution and once both parties had made that contribution there would be a project that would benefit both.  The Department of Agriculture through the beneficiaries would receive the benefit and then Estina would receive some – some dividends from the proceeds which the processing plant may render after the milk has been processed. That is how I understood the relationship.  Now the project at that point in time did not progress to its logical conclusion.  It was terminated before its logical conclusion.  So what was put onto the ground was what – is – is what the department received as assets due to the cancellation of the agreement.   Chairperson my understanding from the outset was that Estina would construct the processing plant.  That is that contribution and that is why the advice was also that that processing plant had to be constructed on land not belonging to the municipality or the Provincial Government in order to make sure that it does not fall within the definition of a public/private partnership.So that was my understanding that that processing plant would be – Estina’s contribution would be to construct the processing plant.    Eventually yes Chair.    Yes.    That is correct Chairperson.    Chairperson I cannot remember the exact wording of that resolution but my sense is that the Free State Development Corporation should take over the management of theproject.    Chairperson it is basically to support small, micro and medium – small, medium, micro organisations SMMEs and also to stimulate economic development.  I heard the argument yesterday about whether FDC was the appropriate vehicle and I looked at the objectives of FDC as it is contained in the Act – the Free State Development Corporation Act – and with all due respect Ithink if you look at those objectives it may include the management of this project as an effort to stimulate the economy of the province in that area. I may just indicate that and I may be right or wrong but my initial perception was that this project was supposed to be the start of a dairy hub in the North Eastern part of the Free State.  It would not have been limited to what was on the ground during this period that the project lasted but it would be extended to other farms – could be acquired for beneficiaries with the same type of project where initially a piece of land and a number of cows is given to a beneficiary but thebeneficiary is then – there is also a milking dairy – a milking parlour constructed on that other farm in which beneficiaries receive training and eventually have a commercial dairy business on a farm which will then provide milk to this processing plant on the municipal land the initial plant that has been constructed.So the picture that I had in my mind from the presentation initially was that it was entered creating an economic injection into the Northern Eastern Free State.  So as I say with all due respect and once I have heard that if two lawyers agree one is not a lawyer but I see a bit differently than – than my colleagues.    I think so Chair.    Chairperson I am not really able to comment on that.  I was not involved in the conclusion of any agreement between the FDC and any service provider to manage the farm.  So I am not sure what motivated certain amounts and on what itwas premised at that point in time.  It is very difficult for me to say. It could be that it was more expensive but I am not sure what premised that additional amount when the contract was concluded.    That is correct.  Are you referring to the decision to terminate the – the agreement with Estina?    Ja.   Yes.  Chairperson on 26 January last year the Hawks executed a search and seizure warrant on the Office of the Premier.  It means the whole department and they obtained records of the minutes and resolutions of the ExecutiveCouncil and we indicated to them that we have information that fits into what is contained in the warrant both in my office as well as the offices of Advocates Swanepoel and Ditira and we offered to provide them with that and we asked them whether we can make – just make copies for our own records.So what I currently have is copies of the original documents which were seized by the Hawks in terms of the warrant and I qualify to say that although I cannot be absolutely 100 percent sure that all documents which were in the original file has been copied.  From my recollection it looks like it is quite a composite record of what existed prior in the original files.    Chairperson as I have indicated yesterday when I initially heard about the project I thought it was a very good idea.  I must honestly say I was quite excited and I had this picture in my mind of what will be the outcome of this.  It sounded extremely good and I still think that if it was properly managed to its logical conclusion it could still ascertain what was initially envisaged. What in the meantime happened and I am not an economist of any kind but it was supported in the papers that the price of milk which the farmers are being paid has plummeted significantly.  I am aware that – that in some instances and it was reported in newspaper articlesand that is where I picked it up that farmers were unable to sell their milk to processing plants and it is fairly big dairy operations that could not sell the milk. Farmers took their tankers into townships and they just distributed the milk to – to people whoever they wanted it because theycould not sell it.  So if you look at this project and my colleagues in the department may be able to give more information it need – it needs now some intervention and in terms of the court order when the farm was forfeited to the state and handed back to the Free State Provincial Government there needs to be a plan that looks at the diversification of farming operations on that farm to benefit the community. It could include the dairy.  It could include - and the court order also provided that a mentor with the necessary skills should be appointed to develop that diversification plan specifically to benefit the community and the processes currently underway to – to try and makethe farm viable as a – as a farming operation which benefits specifically the community in that area. Chairperson if I just may add something and it was discussed yesterday and …    I thought about it last night and that is clause – it is 3.15 – the cancellation clause in the (intervenes).    15.3.  Chairperson that is the standard clause that we include in most of the agreements where it isappropriate and I thought I should just explain where it comes from.  The Free State Provincial Government like other Provincial Governments has a sealed envelope of money which basically consists of an equitable share that is received from National Government determined in accordance with a specific formula, the grants that wehave heard about and then which are additional grounds for specific purposes and then own revenue and following some discussions that we had with Treasury and some budget - Legotla meetings that I attended I discussed it with my colleagues and we thought that we should introduce a mechanism in our contracts that can provide for a reprioritisation of policies which will call a reprioritisation of funds. If I make an extreme example.  If for instance there is a disaster in which a number of homes of people are destroyed there is not a contingency reserved in Government in the Free State Provincial Government that we can use.  It simply has to come from areprioritisation of funds and one of the things that we thought that we could do is to build in a mechanism in our contracts that if it is necessary and if it is possible to terminate a contract at a certain or a project at a certain point in time to make additional funds available to deal with any contingency that may arise we should include that in contracts.  So I just thought I should explain that.    Pardon.    That is where it comes from.   Ja.    Ja.    Thank you Chairperson.  It sounds definitely following the experience here.  It is something thatwe will looking into more carefully.    Thank you Chairperson.   I am glad that I will requested to come and explain.  It was – it was a good experience for me as well.    Chairperson no but …    They are more and welcome at any stage …    To (intervenes).

ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Morning again Chairman. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman we are today dealing with Exhibit HH4 which is the affidavit and Annexures of Mr Ephraim Makhosini Dhlamini.  HH4, Exhibit HH4.   Thank you Chairman.  Chairman with your leave Mr Dhlamini is ready to be sworn in.    We have an interpreter sitting with Mr Dhlamini.    Chair just as a preface Mr Dhlamini is one of the beneficiaries of the Vrede Dairy Project.  Mr Dhlamini good morning.    Please turn to page 1 of the witness bundle marked HH4 that you have.    That is so Chairman, I have gone through the motions of identifying, at least his names, and the fact that hesigned the document, he knows that, that is his signature and he remembers the date, he knows the date on which he signed it.  I thought if we go through it, jus those formalities, the rest we’ll then ask the – he’s really going to speak to the document Chairman, this is just for the formality.   Correct Chairman that he is Ephraim Dhlamini and that’s his signature and the date on which he signed the statement.    That is so Chairman, particularly because it was then read back to him but then in isiZulu the statement written inEnglish was then read back to him in isiZulu.  So he doesn’t really read English, he doesn’t read it as well he’s not as fluent, he does prefer to give his evidence in isiZulu.    It does not say that Chairman, that I concede.    Chairman, with your leave, could we just confirm with Mr Dhlamini what the position is?     Thank you sir.    Yes thank you Chairman.  Chairman thelegal team has had discussions with both beneficiaries, Mr Dhlamini and Mr Ncongwane, they both confirm that they can read and understand English, they have read their statements and understood them and they then signed the statements after having read them and understood them.    Chairman so I would suggest that the way we proceed is that because Mr Dhlamini in this instance is more comfortable in speaking his mother tongue, isiZulu, I ask the question in English, the interpreter interprets it for him for convenience sake, heresponds in the language he is comfortable with, she will then interpret that back into English and we proceed along those lines.    Thank you Chairman.    Thank you Mr Dhlamini can I just ask again, can you please confirm on page 1 that this is your name and on page 9 that, that is your signature.    And we call the DCJ, the Chairman in this forum.    Thank you and you confirm that you are familiar with the contents of this statement?     Thank you very much.  Are there any changes that you would want to make to this statement at this point  in time?    Have you had any interviews with any investigative agencies with regards to the Vrede Dairy Farm matter?    Who were these?    Can I ask you to do this for the Chairman, I really just want formal agencies such as the Hawks, or the Public Protector as opposed to Government officials whom you may have interacted with.    Thank you, you’ll give the detail of that evidence later, which other agency of Government have you spoken with?    Yes Chairman I was just trying to deal with the 65 transcription rule that we have just so that we know who else may have a record in terms of our rule 65 of what this witness might have said to one of our agencies, I start with that straight after that, it was really just a matter of clearing the 65 rule Chairman.    Thank you Chairman, can I do that, my next question is, where do you live?   How long have you been living there?    Are you employed?   What business are you employed in?    Thank you.  Please describe the environment of Vrede for the Chairman, the environment you live in, which would include Thembalihle Township.    Yes continue.   In paragraph 2 of your statement, you mention that you are the chairman of the African Farmers Association and that Mr Ncongwane is a member as well.    What is Mr Ncongwane’s position in this organisation?    What does the African FarmersAssociation do, what’s your core business as an association?    Are there a number of such small farmers in your area?   Are there a number of such small farmers in your area?    Now you state that you have personal knowledge of the meetings that led to the selection of beneficiaries forthe Vrede Dairy Farm Project?    Please explain to the Chairman in short bits when these meetings took place, where these meetings took place, who attended these meetings?  Can I just assist you with structure, so if you could start with the first meeting and complete that before you go to the second meeting.      Can I just ask you, if I might interrupt you, from the community are you able to identify some of the people you know who were at that first meeting?      Who addressed you at that meeting?    What is the position of Mr Motaung in Vrede?    Thank you continue.      Before you go to the end of the meeting, how did you receive what Mr Zwane was telling you did it sound like something that could happen that he could bring to Vrede?     Before you deal with the issue of land that had been requested, go back to what the outcome of the meeting was for you, you were about to tell us about that and I had interrupted you.    There are some media articles that we have collected from open source media and there is one that is written on the 28 t h of April 2018, Chairman for your reference there is a media bundle that you have at your disposal.    And this particular article is on page 8.  You may want to read it later.    I am just going to summarise the salient points.   What I would like you to do is tell the Chairman if this is your recollection of what happened on that day in 12?      And I quote    “The main guest was a local figure who had soared up the ranks of the governing African National Congress and come back with an enticing offer.”    “Over the next few hours the visiting political boss Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane sold them on his latest deal.”     “A government backed dairy farm that they as landless black farmers would control.”     “They would get an ownership stake in the business.”     “Just by signing up.”     “They would go to India for training all expenses paid.”     “To hear him tell it the dairy would bring jobs to the impoverished, help build a clinic and fix the roads.”    There is more Mr Dhlamini in that article. What I wanted to confirm is what you heard at that first meeting is what I have just read to you.    Please explain what you then heard in the second meeting that is different to what you heard in the first meeting?    Now who of government officials attended the second meeting?    Are you saying Mr Zwane was there as well?    Thank you.  Can I just also tidy up one last aspect of meeting 1?  What – Was Mr Zwane’s wife Ms Roseline Zwane who is known as Topsy also at that first meeting?    Just for context that name I again get from a media article we got from the open network which is in the media bundle on page 12.      No he does not have to go.  I just want it on record.    Of Ms – Mrs Rosaline Zwane.    Thank you Chairman.  At – was – were – were representatives for the beneficiaries selected at any point in time?    No it is a general question.  No, no were they chosen at any point in time?    Mr Dhlamini can I ask you to do this.  I will come back to the evidence you have just given.  Because it is important.  At this point in time I simply want to know if the community of Vrede Thembalihle township selected certain persons to represent beneficiaries to this dairy project?    I do not want you to focus on the secondmeeting.  I simply asked the question as a general question.      Would you be able to recall roughly when that committee was selected?    When I look at paragraph 16 of your statement you mention Ms Meyer asking for your Identity documents soit is page 5 paragraph 16.     Thank you Chairman.   It does Chairman.    If we want to complete both witnesses.    But we have made arrangements for them to continue tomorrow.    If for any reason we cannot.    Conclude today.    Yes were are Chair.    Mr Dhlamini there are a couple of things Ijust wanted to explore with you.  The first one – can I just tidy up the issue of the beneficiary representatives so that is the first one I will go to just to conclude that evidence.  After that I will actually just take you back to evidence you had given earlier on about the cows that you were going to get from the project.  So if you – if you allow me to that iswhat I would like to do.    Thank you.  So my question had been whether you had elected or selected people to represent the beneficiaries in all things to do with the Vrede Dairy Farm?    Do you recall the names of those people and how many people you selected?    Yes and did you at any point have sight of a Beneficiary Agreement that the department would have prepared and presented to the beneficiaries?    So if Mr June Mahlaba were to come to the Commission and say that he signed a Beneficiary Agreement in the presence of other beneficiaries - and I hope I am correct in – in what Ihave heard him saying - including yourself.  You would say that that is incorrect?    Thank you, thank you.    Thank you Chairman.  So if I say to you that Mr June Mahlaba will come to this Commission if he gets the opportunity to tell the Commission that he signed a Beneficiary Agreement in the presence of other beneficiaries and if I am not mistaken in your presence as well.    What position did Mr June Mahlabaoccupy in that group that you selected to represent you?    Can I also ask this question?  Were any of the other beneficiaries - to your knowledge - asked to sign a Beneficiary Agreement?    No, no.    It is Mr June Mahlaba – B-A.    But the department accepted that this was the committee that you had accepted – that you had selected?    You have explained the role of the beneficiary committee.    Did you ever get any report from that beneficiary committee?    Did you get an explanation from the Chairman or any member of the committee as to why they had not reported on anything to the membership that they represented?    Can I then – thank you Mr Dhlamini- can I then just go back a step to evidence you were giving slightly earlier?  You spoke of 10 head of dairy cows being given to beneficiaries?    Did I also hear you say that it would – those would have been exchanged for red meat cattle that the beneficiary had owned originally?    But it was not a condition of being abeneficiary that you sell your red meat cattle?    You could elect – you could decide to sell your cattle if you felt you wanted to take a greater shareholding in the dairy project?    You do not count your chickens before they hatch?    I like the Zulu expression.  It is better than the English Chairman.    Yes.    Chairman I – I have the benefit of having consulted twice …    With this witness.    Yes.    Thank you Chairman.  Mr Dhlamini but itis correct that you and other small farmers had not been using the land that was allocated to the dairy farm for your red meat cattle.  You took your cattle to different land that you owned for them to find their feed etcetera.    So you had hoped that Government would give you land for your cattle?    Thank you Chairman.  Mr Dhlamini I really only want clarity on this one point.  4 400 hectares was purchased for the dairy farm?    You are correct and with a couple of transactions that is the land that was identified for the Vrede Dairy Farm.   While that was going on even before while those commercial farmers were using that land the people of Thembalihle who had cattle had to look after their cattle and find grazing for them wherever they could?  Can you just stop there?    Mr Dhlamini I really just want to ask you to help me separate issues.    It is important because I have read your statement.  I understand your statement.    So I am just going to go slowly again.  I really just want to clarify the issue of the commercial farmers who occupied the 4 400 hectares of land that ended up being part of the Vrede Dairy Farm Project.    Yes.  I have no difficulty with that.  I understand that evidence.    I have also understood your evidence that the municipality gave you specific land where you and others could keep your cattle.    I have also understood you to say that,that land that the Municipality allocated to you was not appropriate for the cattle farming you and your colleagues were involved in?    The only thing I was trying to clarify was that, when those commercial farmers occupied that 4 400 hectares youoccupied a complete different piece of land that was allocated to you by the Municipality.    I have also understood your evidence in that you have said you have been agitating with Government, you have been asking Government for better grazing land for your cattle?    I’m satisfied with that.  Can I then comeback to the last point that mixes these two strains of evidence a little bit and the question is, did anybody that you know, sell their cattle in the expectation that they would be allocated dairy cows by the Vrede Dairy Project?    Can you give us, just one or two names and the reason I ask you is this, again, Mr June Mahlaba, in his affidavit has stated that to his knowledge nobody sold their cattle in the expectation that they were going to be allocated dairy cows by theVrede Dairy Project.    How many did he sell, if you know the number?   Yes but at least that clarifies that point, the only point was, did anybody sell their cattle in the expectation in receiving others, you answered that.    Can I ask you this question as well, for those people – and this is – what was told to you, I’d like to know what either Mr Zwane or Mr Motaung told you in 2012/2013, did they indicate where the dairy cows that the beneficiaries would buy would be kept?     Can you just help me understand, how that was going to work, if they explained it at all.  So if I was abeneficiary and I had ten cattle, I would take them across to the dairy and I would have to go there everyday to milk them or the dairy would milk them, did they explain these details to you?    Yes, you are making it clear.  So my understanding of your evidence is, as a beneficiary therefore, you would find an employment opportunity at the farm, have I got this right?    Of course you did not get employment at the dairy farm?    But there are those members of the community who did get employment at the dairy farm?    When you distinguish between the farmersand the members of the community are you saying that the farmers are the ones who had cattle and the members of the community who got employment were people with different skills?    Do you know what happened to the promise that you would be trained in India?    Please explain to the Chairman.    Yes there are media reports and we have reference documents that we will present you in due course, Chairman,  just to confirm some of the evidence he is giving on who went across to India but can we…(intervention).    No Chairman, I think that – we’ll just give you the documentary evidence.   I’d like to just move on a little bit to your paragraph 17 Mr Dhlamini where you speak about refusing to give out (indistinct) ID, your ID copies, you know you were talking about that atthe meeting.  Please just explain that scene to the Chairman.    Chairman I believe we are done with the second meeting, if you very quickly look at the paragraph 12 where it starts, it’s about the attendance, 13 relates to what they were told about the cows, where the cows would stay etcetera, the 4 000 hectares, 14 deals with the shareholding 52%, 28%, 20%, that split, hospitals, roads…(intervention).    We have dealt with it Chairman and then their expectations for better future, we’ve dealt with that.      Thank you Chairman.  Can I then just confirm that the third meeting would also have taken place in 2012?    So I had asked you just to explain to the Chairman what your view was on that day with respect to the physicalID copies that were being requested from you.    You were requesting them not to hand up their ID?    Are you talking about Government funds here?    Mr Dhlamini I know the time is importantbut we’ll actually go through all of your evidence, I think that the Chairman will allow us to do that.      So the purpose for – can I rephrase that, so can you explain to the Chairman what you then decided to do, did you present your ID number so that your name could be put on the list, did the other members of the community do the same or what happened?    So that those ID numbers and namescould be entered on the list that was going to go to Pretoria or did he continue to say, don’t do it?    And you joined the group that was permitting officials to make copies of their ID documents?    And the official who was coordinating thiswas Ms Alta Meyer?    Ms it is a female.      Ms Meyer also asked you to sign certainforms, is this correct?    When did she ask you to sign forms and at the same time tell you about the rules of the project?    Thank you Chairman.  I am going to take you back to your paragraph 17 and the second sentence of that    That explains what you may have referredto here as the rules of the project.  Is that correct?    Yes thank you.  Thank you Mr Dhlamini.  Then the last thing to clear up is just the matter of those certain forms that we – you talk about in the same sentence.  Can you just assist with that?  Did you or did you not sign certain forms at the time that you were handing up your ID documents?   Would this have been at the time that you were handing in your ID’s for copies to be made?    That is fine because you have Mr Ncongwane who might remember some of the details.  So I do not think you should worry too much about it Mr Dhlamini, you are doing your best.   Can I actually move on to the Imbizo that took place at Frankfort.  Please just tell the Chairman what that was about?    Would you remember roughly when that would have been?    Continue what happened at that meeting?    Can I just get clarity on this?  Because I am reading the statement as you are talking.  In the statement you refer to Ma Gupta but are you talking about knowing that these people were members of the Gupta family or are you simply referring to them as a class of people who would be Indian and that is – I just wantclarity – and that is why you used the term Ma Gupta?    Who had informed you that you had members of the Gupta family working at the dairy project?    Yes continue.  What did you then say at the Imbizo?    What was Minister Zokwana’s response to you?    Did Mr Thabethe in fact resolve the difficulty you were placing before the Minister at that Imbizo?    Thabethe.    Can we…    Mr Dhlamini at this Imbizo you heard Minister Senzeni Zokwana?    Were there any other members of Parliament or members of the Provincial Legislature in attendance?    So you are not able to identify the otherVIP’s or the other officials who were at the Imbizo?    Let us move onto the fourth meeting whichwas convened you say in or about 2014.  Who was in attendance at that meeting?    The fourth meeting.    Yes what – what else happened at that meeting?    Who did she say had asked her to come and see you in Vrede?    Whom did she say requested her to visit Vrede? MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through    And why was she in Vrede?    So your understanding had all along been that the operations or what was happening at the Vrede Dairy Farm involved the Department of Agriculture and the Municipality?    Now the Free State Development Corporation took over the running of Estina sometime around August 2014.  That means that this meeting would have taken place just a little before that. MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through    Oh so you actually got to – to find out or to know that the FDC had taken over the Vrede Dairy Project?    Who told …?    But soon thereafter and I was suggesting to you that in or about August the FDC did take over the farm.  So my question to you was did you find out that in fact the FDC had now taken over the farm?    Chairman I was satisfied that he said that at the time he attended the meeting they were informed that the FDC was about to take over.  My subsequent question was then when did you find out that in fact the FDC had taken over.  So there were two separate questions Chairman.    Now can you please explain what you set out in paragraph 20 where - and I will just paraphrase - you discuss the question whether or not you were recognised as beneficiaries.  When did that discussion take place?   Where did that meeting take place?    And who attended that meeting?    Please just clarify before you go further.  Who intended nominating new beneficiaries?    Do you have any names of the officials from FDC who attended the meeting you are relating?   Now what exactly did Tuto and Koliza – in fact you said it was Tuto and …    Koliza?    What did they say to you?   What was the position you then took at the meeting with the FDC?  What was the outcome of that meeting?    How many members of the community attended that meeting?    And how had they been contacted and told about that FDC meeting?    Can you then just tell us about the fifth – what you call the fifth meeting in your paragraph 21?    Thank you Chairman.  Could you then just tell the Chairman briefly what happened during the fifth meeting?  So who attended it and what happened at that meeting?    What – who attended, what happened, when it happened – when the meeting took place?   Can you just stop there for one minute?  Did the Premier personally call the meeting or did people he delegated to do so call the meeting?   Yes continue.    Where was this meeting intended to take place?    Yes continue.  What then happened on that day?    Continue.    Was Tuto there?  Was Koliza there?    So that means yes they were there?    Did you meet with the Premier and with Mr Zwane?    So the – the upshot of that meeting was that you did not get the opportunity to speak to the Premier?    I want to then just deal with some of the other meetings but can I just clear one matter Chairman?  My colleague has been checking on the employment of Alta Meyer …   And there is a – a document in the Reference Bundle A at page 2-3-4.  You may just want to make a note.  It is a document to General Managers.  It is from the Agriculture and    Thank you Chair.    Briefly tell the Chairman about the meeting that ME …    Thank you Chairman.    That would be convenient.   Thank you Chairman.  Mr Dhlamini we are at page 6, and that’s paragraph 22, and I really just want you to give the Chairman a quick summary of what happened when MEC Qabathe (spelt) attended a meeting with you.  I know you have summarised in one sentence what happened but I know that you in the narrative you just may want to add one or two more details.   Mic.     And Chief Director Mr Modiba was with you as well at that meeting.    What contribution did he make to the discussions?   What did you then do?  You the individual.    Can you clarify for the Chairman are we talking about one meeting where MEC Qabathe and Chief Director Modiba were present or are we talking about two separate meetings, one where MEC Qabathe and Mr Modiba were present and a different one where Mr Modiba was on his own, just for clarity.    Mr Dhlamini when you explain ulo and point the record does not know what you are pointing at.    Yes, the first one was MEC Qabathe.    With officials.    And one of those officials happened to be Chief Director Modiba.    Then a separate meeting took place at a later stage.  I am just looking at your paragraph 22, where you say no progress was made on our complaint it should be about the dairy so I left that meeting.  Tell us about that meeting with Mr Modiba and why you left that meeting.    So this meeting obviously took place after the Premier had come to the dairy and after MEC Qabathe had been to Vrede?    In terms of timeframes Mr Dhlamini if the FDC took over running the firm in mid-August, around the 14 t h of August 2014 are you able to give the Chairman a rough idea as to when these meetings, the Qabathe meeting and the subsequent Modibameeting would have taken place?  Would it have been in 2014, after August 2014 or would it have been early in 2015 just so the Chairman has a timeframe.    The MEC, she is female.    So I was trying to find out if the meeting with Modiba took place in 2014 or 2015, I’m just trying to locate that meeting.   It is important because the next person you had a meeting with was Dr Masiteng, Dankise Masiteng.    Roughly when did that meeting take place?    Thank you.  Tell us about that meetingwith Dr Masiteng.    Dr Masiteng and who, Mr Modiba?   Were you alone or were you accompanied by somebody?    Yes?    Continue, so you went outside?    Who, when you say them who are you talking about?    Yes I was inside the house.    Yes, so you went outside?    Where was Kulisa, where was Tudo when you went outside?    Who was he saying this to?    Yes continue.    Thank you Chairman.  At that point didyou then go back into the facility where everybody else was?    And did the meeting proceed?    Having changed the venue did the meeting proceed?    You then moved to the bigger venue?    And the meeting proceeded?    Who was in attendance at the time?    What are you describing as this thing?    Or on the job.    And how – how was that meeting concluded?    You also mention in your last sentence of paragraph 23 that as you were asking questions there were municipal officials who tried to deflect those questions.     Oh he was ANC counsellor but he was also a member of the ANC?    Talk to the Chairman about that meeting with Mr Maimane?    Can – can I interrupt you?  Yourparagraph 24 you say Warden beneficiaries were with you but not the ones from Memel.  So let us just get the record right.    So what is the correct version?    Then the second question I have you then talk about they refused you entry or they stopped you from entering, who are they?    At this point in time were you with Mr Maimane?    Was he given entry?   And how large was the group that remained outside the premises?    Okay so tell us what then happened?    Was this the first time you were visiting the dairy?    Yes continue.  So you entered the premises with Mr Maimane?   Could you identify that specific tractor?   How were you able to identify it?    Was this the only item you recognised as one that government had given to – or the Department of Agriculture had given to the community of Vrede?    Yes.  Continue.    That is a plant.    That – and if cattle eats it they die?    Did you see quite a large field of thatparticular plant?    Please describe to the Chairman when that plant emerges?  It has been described to me but please describe what you know of that plant to the Chairman?    And the FDC was managing the farm atthat point in time?    Any other comments on that visit?    What time of the day was this visit of yours?    Did you talk to the management, did you talk to any of the employees?   And who was engaging the employees in these discussions?  Was it Mr Maimane or was everybody talking to whoever they could find?    I see.   No.    A little earlier please Chairman.    Yes.    Thank you.
INTERPRETER:  Yes Chair I am.   Yes I was sworn in Your Worship.    Sworn in.    I’m used to Court so every now and then you will hearYour Worship, so please pardon me.    Is there – sorry can you please repeat?    Where are we now the first or second?    Thanks your worship.    The literal meaning is you do not name the child before the birth of the child.    Yes.    Hm.    So do you mean, did they provide the ID numbers.    The third meeting?    Your Worship [indistinct] clarity.    The surname is?    Your Worship I am not sure if the…    Can I get the question again?    The fourth meeting now your worship.   The last part of the …    And when?    Your Worship I need help.    Your Worship I am not sure if the names – I am not familiar with the equipment that he is making. So I am not sure if the names are correct.  I know that it is a tractor and he mentioned tractor. 
WITNESS:  Ephraim Makhosini Dhlamini    I have no objections.    I swear.    So help me God. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.   Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.   That is correct.    Yes we did hear about that but in the second meeting where – which was addressed by Mr Mosebenzi Zwane.    What we heard in the second meeting now Chair is that they were going to establish or start up a dairy farm in Vrede with 100 beneficiaries and that as beneficiaries wewill have a 52% stake into the farm or the project.  It is also correct that 20% was said to be going to go towards the constructions of road of a hospital as well as bursaries for the children or our children in the area.  And then 28% will go to the government according to them.  It was good news to us and we were happy with that.  I was not interested in the dairy farming like I said but when I heard about us being taken to India for training that – for training of whatever is going to happen in the dairy or the farming – okay when you – you will have a choice of what you want to be trained on – which one are you interested in.  We were excited about it.     Mr Thabethe was always present where there is Mr Mosebenzi Zwane.  The mayor as well was – would be present and Dume.   Dume was a municipality employee orofficial.  Mr Mphahlele from Agriculture too [indistinct] Mr Sebeko they would also be present in the meeting.  That is where we would see them in person Your Worship we know them personally anyway.    Yes he was.  On that day yes he was present.    The main speaker on the day in question Your Worship or the prominent speaker on the day in question it was Mr Mosebenzi Zwane Your Worship – I mean Chair and then the mayor Mr Motaung uttered the words that he is also happy that someone who also grew up in the very same area in Vrede Your Worship is bringing good news to the community.  Those were the mainspeakers on the day in question and those are the people who summoned or called the meeting.  No-one else addressed or spoke in the meeting except when we were now socialising Your Worship then joking there – ja that is all.    I do believe I trusted she was present on the day in question because there were a lot of people who were present when Mr Zwane was there or when he came there.  The councillor by the name of Koko was also there.  Those are the names Your Worship which do not appear in the statements because we only mentioned the names of the people who were there to address us, the main speakers of the meeting.   Does he have?    The name – which name?    I know her physically or in person and I know that in most of the meetings that will be held in thearea Your Worship and the municipal meetings she would be present.  So I know and I do believe that she was present on the day in question though there were a lot of people who attended the meeting.     The reason my response is I trust or I believe that she was present Your Worship it is because I did not see her physically that she was present in the meeting.  I am just believing or trusting that she was part of the meeting without having seen her sitting in the meeting.   On that day this was explained as to – they explained the shares and how are you going to benefit from the whole thing regarding the shares and that the government willpurchase cattle per person so that one can have them contributed into the dairy product – I mean project.  We were then also advised that those who are having cattle for red meat should sell their cattle so that they can have more shares – money to buy or purchase shares into the diary project.   No.    Yes after a while yes we did elect the representatives.    The committee was selected after Alta Meyer took our ID’s and sent them – or took them to Pretoria and I assume it was now the fourth meeting.    Indeed it was Ms Meyer and the day was Saturday.    Yes.    Ms – Ms Alta Meyer.    No not on that day they only took the ID’s only.    Second meeting Ms Alta Meyer was there.  It was on that meeting where we also elected the committee.    Yes Sir.    Kholiza, Thuto, they are the ones who notified us about this meeting.  Alta Meyer was coming to that meeting.    Thutoganye, Kholiza Sibeko.   They were hired by Mr Mosebenzi Zwane when he came in as a MEC.  He said he is employing them to be his eyes and ears exactly their job description Your Worship I would not be able – I mean Chairperson I would not be able to tell youbut he said they were there to be his eyes and ears in the meeting in his absence.    I heard that they were contracted or they had a contract in the government.    For the third meeting Your Worship there was a loud-haler and some of us were called.    If I remember well it was Dume Kobene.  Yes.    Yes.    I am confused.    It was – it was a meeting.  There was nothing to be discussed there but to take the ID’s so that they will be taken to – or hand over their ID’s so that they can be taken to Pretoria.    That is all.    It was Alta Meyer who was just taking the ID copies and then only gave us just a few rules of what should happen in the dairy project.  Nothing hectic like do not take out the assets that belongs into the dairy project like garden spade nor [indistinct] should be taken out of the dairy project or the cows taken out.  So basically those were the rules – small rules that she was giving us, just minor.  Not taking out a fodder or grazing food.  It was just about the ID’s only.    The rules of the project came up in the fourth meeting.  If I understand very well here it was only about the taking or handing over of the ID’s only.  After that third meeting then she came to the fourth meeting.    I do not remember well Your Worship as to whether she informed us about the rules of the project in the third meeting, the meeting where the ID’s were taken or were handed over or when exactly.    If I remember well I think the word documents that we signed there are forms that we signed.    It is a long time ago.  I – it is – it happened long time ago I do not remember.    Yes.   There was an Imbizo at Frankfort Mr Zokwana was there and Lesedi FM was there as well.    I do not remember the day exactly but I remember that I wanted to raise this issue of dairy Vrede one of the people who wanted to raise the issue of the dairy – I meandairy project.    We were told that there is a government Imbizo Agricultural department Imbizo.  The people that I saw there was Mr Zokwana and Thebethe and other people were in the other – association with us from Qwaqwa.    We raised some issues or complaints.  I raised my hand.  I did get the opportunity to speak out about the dairy project Vrede dairy project.     I raised an issue about the dairy project which is at Vrede and that they are now Indians people there, the Gupta’s who – I could hear that they were talking but thelanguage I could not get it clearly as to what language was this because I could pick it up that they are not conversant in English or their English was not – I could not understand it.  As well as they could not even speak Sesotho.  I had a problem with the language of the Gupta’s what exactly they were saying.      We would see them there.  We were already informed that they are a – the Gupta family who are working in the dairy project.      We – there are people who are working in the dairy project who are living with us in the same township and some we are related to.  They are the ones who informed us that there is a Gupta family that is working in the dairy project.   I raised the issue that our identity documents were used to get the dairy project running and we have not received any proceeds.  It is functioning fully but we have notreceived any proceeds therefore I was requesting Mr Zokwana to help us, Zokwana to help us.    That is correct.    He said I used wrong names or I referred to these people with – like with wrong names then Mr Thabethe then said he will intervene and sort this thing out.   No.    He did not want me to refer tothese people as Gupta’s.    Mr Thabethe was saying hewas going to resolve the issue of the dairy Vrede project.    I was telling him about the dairy project, Vrede dairy project.  Our names were taken.  Funds were released from the government.  The dairy project is functional and we are not getting any money from it.  The promises that were made that we will be taken to India for training it did not happen.  This means that there is some    Criminal activity yes criminal activity is going on and yet our ID copies were used.    That is correct.    A long time – a long time indeed.   I assume it was more than a year.    Yes.    From Parliament I saw MrSenzeni Zokwana.  And then Mr Thebethe I saw him from Bloemfontein.  There were others though I did not know their names.     That is correct.    No.    I would not be able to identify them but there was also Lesedi FM but the others I would not be able to – be in a position to identify them.    The fifth meeting.    Alta Meyer, Municipal officials or employees, councillors, that is where we even nominated or elected the committee.      Oh meaning they forgot in the process that they were supposed to proceed with the project Your Worship which was already initiated at [indistinct].    That is correct Your Worship they did admit they were supposed to follow the procedures that I mentioned.    They agreed with me how the meeting was concluded is that they agreed with me that they did not do as they were required – as per the agreement as to how this project is going to be run.  Like sleeping on duty.  But now they agree with meand they should have done things the way I am advising them to and then that is how the meeting was then dissolved.    That is correct and the person who was interfering a lot during that – me asking questions Your Worship it was a counsellor by the name of Dume Kobede who was working for the municipality, Kobede.    Yes.    He was a counsellor I am notsure of his position currently but then he was a counsellor.    Nothing was said after that.  There was no response after that.    It did not happen that way and according to my observation it was a way of preventing us from meetingwith Mr Maimane the following day because he was coming the following day to see us.    And then the day came to meet with Mr Maimane at the dairy project farm.  There were community members from Warden and Memel.  They refused us to get into the dairy project premises.    Yes correct.      There were people or community members from Warden not Mamel if I remember well.    There were security guardswho are manning the gate.    That is correct.    Yes he was allowed to get into the – inside the premises.    It was a lot of people who were outside but Mr Maimane was supposed to choose people or a delegation that was supposed to come inside with him.    After he chose his delegation the people that he wanted with him inside.  The next thing we realisedthat the other group was also now inside the premises and apparently they were now allowed to get inside.  I do not know who they called to give them permission to be inside the premises as well.    It was now for the second time, my second visit.  I went even the time when Mr Ace Magashule was there as well.    There were other things that – or issues that we were talking about to a point that I asked them about the tractor which was given to us by the Agriculture Department.  I was actually seeing it there.    Yes.    We once – or we – we used this tractor it was an agreement between ourselves [indistinct] that we will use this tractor for an example we will give it to a person to use it for a certain days maybe two days and bring it back.  It was an agreement that was there between ourselves and Tutu.    It was the tractor itself and the equipment Your Worship that you use with the tractor.    Another thing that we saw Your Worship it is a poison that is used to kill cows.   It is a plant.    That is correct.    That is correct.    It is a green plant.  We call it…    Okay.  We call it Delamoon.  Itis a plant that invades Your Worship.  It comes out from – if the grass grows it grows together with grass.  There was a dead cow there Your Worship it was – the carcass was still lying there.  And the mother Your Worship was there like crying for ja sent like crying.  That is where we then noted that there was a problem with the management it was not up to standard or the correct standards.    That is correct.    That is correct.    We also saw the area where the milking of the cows was taking place and those cows were very old. There was no activity that was going to – productive activity that was going to take place.  Those cows were very old.    We left form the township to the dairy farm itself around ten and we were there for a long time. Although I do not remember exactly for how long but we were there for quite a while.    That is correct we did.  We even spoke to the guy who was operating the tractor and we also wanted to know how much were they earning.    Okay what happened is Mr Maimane asked me to come with him and when he is engaging someone he will then ask me to comment about that or ask questions.  So I would get the opportunity to ask questions.   Yes. 
CHAIR:  Were you where the meeting was going to take place together with other farmers? 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  Oh I thought Dume Kobede worked for the ANC that is what is what is noted at your paragraph 8.
