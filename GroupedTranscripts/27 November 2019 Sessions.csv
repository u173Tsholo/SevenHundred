ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The computers were giving technical problems this morning but we believe we have sorted it out.    And are able to approach Mr Chabi’s evidence in the manner that we had originally envisaged.      Thank you Chair.    Chair you will recall ...(intervenes).     Yes I am going to make a suggestion in that regard.    Subject of course to what the Chair.    How the Chair views that.    Just to place on record for whoever will be reading this transcript in time to come mister – we presented Mr Chabi for the first time on the 29 t h of May 2019.  And at the end of that day his testimony was postponed to a later date and that date in effect is today.  At the point of presenting Mr Chabi he tendered a certain set of slides and with the leave of the Chair these were marked Exhibit BB8B.  BB8B, the slides, admitted into evidence are in respect of two transactions 1064 and transaction 100 respectively.  There are two separate sets of slides. Following a request by the Chair for statements Mr Chabi has since now prepared a statement in each case for 1064 and 100 consistent with the slides to the extent possible and these are being submitted today.  Chair we have placed before you a file.  Because the statements directly relate to the exhibit we have sought to find a way to link the statements to the exhibit.  We suggest therefore that the file also has – be marked Exhibit 8B except we suggest each statement in 10B – BB8B1 and BB8B2.  And the file before the Chair should have both statements.  They are divided – there is a divider in the file.  The first divider would be marked 1 and that relates to the 64 transaction.  The second divider is marked 2 and that would be in respect of the 100 transaction.      Yes, yes.  It has a ...(intervenes).     Not on yours?    Sometimes they run out of ...(intervenes).     Divider.    A green divider.  We will bring that to the attention Chair.    Oh.    And it gets more interesting than that because I have a green number 1 and a yellow number 2.    Yes Chair.    No we appreciate that Chair.    For purposes of today the – and we will update your file accordingly.    But most importantly you have got two dividers there one marked 1 and the other marked 2.    So insofar as 1 is concerned if the Chair could just recall that is in respect of 1064.  And 2 is in respect of 100.    And we will deal with each transaction in turn.    Getting back then to the issue that the Chair raised at the beginning of our presentation about how we intend to approach this.    On the 29 t h of May when Mr Chabi first appeared he dealt with a preliminaries about himself, introduced himself, his background, professional qualifications and experience and he had started some of his actual evidence.      If the Chair has regard to BB8B1.    At page 1 that is where the statement starts.    Although he had started on his actual testimony – evidence before you.    We suggest the following that it is not necessary for Mr Chabi to replace his qualifications and those issues on record as they already are on record.    But we restart his actual evidence.    Just so it is in a single transcript.    Yes Chair.    In regard to the evidence.    Thank you Chair.  And we propose to do so.    Just lastly Chair as it is custom perhaps you must admit the file into evidence with the proposed marking.    Under 1 is statement and annexures in respect of 1064.    And under 2 if his statement and relevant annexures in respect of 100.    Thank you Chair.      Thank you Chair.    We got it right.    Thank you Chair.  If I may just mention then for the benefit of those who will read subsequently to distinguish the numbering.    1064 is numbered AOC1064 and page number.  And that is then a bit to distinguish it from 100 which is numbered the red numbering range there is AOC which are his initial 1001.    So there is a middle number.    Indeed.    And 100 as well.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Starting then with 1064.    Before we do so we have not sworn in this – the witness.    If I may request that the witness be sworn in?    .Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair.    Indeed.    That would be the day.    Sorry Mr Chabi please put the microphone closer towards you.    It is not ...(intervenes).     Thank you.    Ja.    Chair.    If I may?    It is not so much input.  One thing I still have to make – to do.    Place on record Mr Chabi has to confirm that this is his statement.    And that he stands by it because now we have gone into the statement itself.    That is the one aspect we had not done.    Because he was beginning to answer you – to answer.    Yes.    Chair it may ...(intervenes).     Or 001.    Chair I think the structure of the statement we have attempted to capture in part what the Chair is suggesting and – and perhaps as I speak Mr Chabi may apply his mind to it.  We are going to work through his evidence in two ways.  We are going to work through the slides which summarise the key parts of his evidence.  And then with the slide up on the screen we then work through the detail of what is on the screen item by item.  We have in the statement set out what his mandate was.  What he understood his mandate to be and then we have said – that is followed by a fairly detailed methodology.  My view is that in dealing with those two issues him – he would begin to develop this glossary of terms that will be important and will consistently applied throughout the statement.  So that is why I say somewhere between.  The statement and what the Chair is suggesting might just answer the Chair’s question or concern.    And I think Chair Ms Molefe will keep a running list for us here.    Of the terms and how Mr Chabi defines them.    And we will type them out and in time update the Chair’s file.    With this glossary of terms.    So as we go along then perhaps as we come across a term.    Then we will help define it before we deal with it.    Indeed Chair.  Now if I may then ...(intervenes).     We will be.  Just to check with Mr Chabi through you Chair?    Whether he understood the request regarding the principles applicable?  Would you be able off the top of your head before we go into the detail of 1064 and 100 to deal at – in high level with those principles for the Chair?    Okay.    You will be able to deal with them.    Okay.  No then we will.    His voice.    May I suggest – there are some files to your left Mr Chabi please take one and put the microphone on the file then perhaps we raise the microphone that might improve audibility.  I am not promising it will.  And then raise the microphone such that at least – pull it closer to you – raise it.      Not as much.     Can I – may I enquire from the technicians whether there is something we can ...(intervenes).     The technicians ...(intervenes).     I think this is the best they can do.  So  perhaps Mr Chabi from time to time I will request you to raise your voice.    And you – I think you can pull the microphone closer to you as well. You need to be comfortable.  You are going to be in that chair for quite some time.    Ja.    The message we get back from the technicians is that the air conditioning is interfering with the sound so perhaps it is better switched off.    Should it become unbearably hot we will switch it on again.    Thank you Chair.    Now we are ready to start.  Mr Chabi you have to your left a file.  If you look at the spine it is written Exhibit BB8B1 And Exhibit BB8B2.  Right?    Now you heard my discussion with the Chair that file is divided in two parts.  The first part is under tab 1 and the second part is under tab 2.  Now let us start with tab 1.    Yes Chair.    They identify the transaction.    Indeed.    Indeed Chair.  No we fully understand.    We will update the spine.    Yes and I will – we will.    Circulate that Chair thank you.  Now at tab 1 there is a pile of documents there.  If you turn to page 1 under that tab.  Do you find it?  There is a document that runs up to page 50.  Now you – do you confirm that that is the statement you preferred?    Oh yes.      And before I forget you can keep your microphone on it does not interfere with the other microphones.    Yes.  So it runs up to page 50.  Do you confirm that is the statement you prepared for the Commission?    Okay.  And the signature appearing at 50 is our signature?    That statement has got five annexures to it and that will run to just before tab 2.  They are flagged 1 to 5.    Correct so.    It has been commissioned.  It is an actual affidavit.    Yes.      And you confirm that those are the annexures to your statement?    You stand by what is stated in the statement?    Are there any changes – significant amendments and changes you would like to make to the statement at this time before it is fully admitted or are you happy with it barring perhaps a typographical error here or?    You are happy with the statement?  Okay.  Then with that confirmation the Chair permitted that you do not deal with matters set out in paragraphs 1.1 to 1.14.  This speaks to your qualifications, your experience and the like because those had – you previously placed on record when you appeared on the 29 t h of May, you recall that?    So by right our plan was to start from page 5 under item 2 and the heading is Mandate.  Okay.  But before we do so the Chair has made a request to you.  The first is to highlight the key principles that are applicable in the exercise that you conducted and the second would be to identify those key terms that are relevant to our discussion today.  So let us start with the principles.    May I just interject.  I had said we start with principles it sounds like you are dealing with terms.    Okay I am happy that you do so just for the record to be clear.    Then we will get to the principles thereafter.    The principles.    Okay.    Okay.  Then just briefly speak to each one of them.    Starting with ETC.    Thank you Chair.  You may continue Mr Chabi and perhaps at this juncture following on the Chair’s questions.  You might want to very briefly tabulate those factors that make up ETC.    Okay.  Thank you.  So now you have defined ETC.    Okay and you have said your next was escalation which you said that is synonymous with inflation?    You mentioned NPV.    And when we talk of the NPV and please state what NPV stands for in full.    Okay.  Then you made mention of Forex Hedging.    Against fluctuation in foreign – in exchange rate?    Alright.  So the – so far we have got the four definitions.  Any other term you can think of currently that perhaps you might want to highlight?    Chair now turning to you if I may.  I do not know whether what we have just done in part answers the question the issue of principles that the Chair posed or perhaps those will be clarified as we go along.    Yes.    Then I would suggest Chair with your leave that we deal with the mandate and the methodology and we take stock thereafter ...(intervenes).     And see whether we have been able to ...(intervenes).     Clarify any pertinent  ...(intervenes).     For that purpose Chair I would request that you turn to page 5 of the statement at paragraph 2 and have open next to you if you may Chair the presentation, slide 2.    Yes.  It is BB8B.    We indicated that BB8B are the slides.    Then we have ...(intervenes).     One and two.    It was admitted ...(intervenes).     On the 29 t h of May.    Ja.  We will be working ...(intervenes).     But currently what is at ...(intervenes).     Page – what is at page 5 of the statement paragraph 2 is the mandate.    And perhaps as we speak through the mandate we might be able to clarify some of the principles.  Please have regard to your paragraph 2 at page 5 Mr Chabi.  You set out under paragraph 2 the mandate that you had obtained with MNS.  Can we deal with what specifically you were required to do and we do in respect of each issue you were requested to look into?    Yes.    Yes please.  Let us talk of your mandate.  We can cross refer to your original mandate, which is also an annexure to your statement, but let us just talk about the mandate.  What were you – what was required of you to do?    Yes.    So then you are informed and are given supporting documentation that the board approved 38.6 billion ETC?    You are requested to evaluate that ETC ...(intervenes).     And you test the reasonability of the variables and the assumptions of the 38.6 billion?    To confirm or otherwise that the values attached to every factor that make up 38.6 billion are reasonable and are correct?    Having done that you are then requested to compare that 38.6 billion ETC with the newly approved ETC of 54 billion?    And conduct the same exercise in respect of 54 billion?    As you did with the 36 – 38.6 billion ETC and express a view therefore whether the difference being 15.4 billion was justified - 15.9 billion was justified in the circumstances?    Thank you.  That was your mandate?    Now at paragraph 2.2 overleaf at page 6 you then introduce another transaction and this is the 100.  You do confirm that Annexure AC1 is your written mandate from MNS and your AC1 will appear at page 51?    Now a reading of AC1 would seem to indicate that that particular written mandate is in respect of 1064 only?    Now at your paragraph 2.2 you now speak of ...(intervenes).     Yes Chair.    It is Annexure AC1.    Apologies.  Annexure AC1.    I should remember to say ...(intervenes).     Annexure AC1 at page ...(intervenes).     And that is at page 52.    As the Chair points out.    The point I was making to Mr Chabi is that Annexure AC1 that written mandate is specific to the 1064 transaction.  At his statement paragraph 2.2 he however introduces the other transaction and I would like him to explain ...(intervenes).     What he would like the Chair to understand by ...(intervenes).     What is set out in paragraph 2.2?    Inaudible again.    Chair it would appear it is okay for everybody.  It must have something to do with that seat.    And this you call the extension of the mandate and it is correct to say that that was – that extension was not in writing?    It was verbal.  Communicated directly to you?    By a partner of MNS?    And you confirm that you understood the mandate correctly?    And you have since ...(intervenes).     You have since submitted a report specific to that mandate?    Thank you.  You proceed then and you suggest that you will deal with each transaction in turn at your paragraph 2.3.  Now we are dealing specifically with 1064.  We will come back at a later point to come deal with 100.  You have set out in very brief terms the methodology that you employed in this investigation or in both investigations in fact and this you set out in your paragraph 3.  Without necessarily reading everything that you set out in paragraph 3 please highlight the key aspects of the methodology.    Now if I may ask you about benchmarking.  Whose work did you benchmark.  Is it your work or is it the business case that was developed by Transnet?  What did you subject to benchmarking in this instance?    Your own work?    Now – then you made mention of peer review.  It – your statement does not state, but what was the outcome of that exercise – of that peer review?    So would it be correct to conclude that a sign off following a peer review is support for your methodology and conclusions as contained in your documentation or in your report?     Okay, you then very briefly before you deal with the detail of the issues you were requested to investigate you provide a summary of findings, okay and that you deal with from your paragraph 4, because it is going to get a bit technical and at times hairy when you deal with the detail, it might be worth our while to look at your mandate, every aspect of your mandate and then we have a sense of what your findings were in relation to each mandate, then we will come deal with how you arrived at that finding, okay.    Now as we said your first mandate was as set-out at your paragraph 2.1.1 and you say it was to assist the reasonability of the variables and assumptions used in modelling the 18 April 2013 business case, you see that?   Now what was your finding in that regard, in very brief terms?     And that finding – sorry – and that finding you make at paragraph 4.1.1.     Correct, okay.   Your next then was to assess the accuracy of the ETC of R38.6 billion, and what was the outcome of that?     So you satisfied yourself that the manner in which the ETC of R38.6 billion was calculated and computed was correct?     So the R38.6 billion therefore is a defensible ETC or number.      Okay and that you set out 4.1.2.   You then state that your next was to identify the reasons for the increase in ETC from R38.6 billion to R54.4 billion and in doing so to test the possibility of the reasons put forward for the R15.9 billion increase in ETC and to opine on the reasonability of the increase in ETC, and what was your finding in that regard?     Was not justifiable?     Okay, you deal with other aspects in relation to this issue at 4.1.3 would you like to quickly highlight those?     So all in all then if we look at your mandate and as you split it up, it was to look into three issues, insofar as reasonability of variables and assumptions were concerned you took no issue with the business case at R38.6 billion.     Okay, secondly you tested the accuracy of the ETC 38.6 billion and you considered it to be justifiable, or supportable?     The only thing you took issue with was the increase affected on the 38.6 billion to create a new ETC of 54.9 billion.     So that is the only issue you take, okay.     Yes.     So you didn’t interrogate how the number of 64 was arrived at?     You accepted that it is 1064 that is intended to be acquired.     And yours is to work out the appropriate ETC for the acquisition of the 1064.     Okay.  Before we then take ...(intervenes).       Thank you Chair.   In your statement we have now come to paragraph 5 where we are dealing with the financial model, but before we do so and before we shortly break for tea, perhaps we should turn to the glossary of terms and introduce two new ones, and it is a business case and a financial model, because they will feature quite regularly going forward.  What do you mean by business case?   You keep referencing the business case.     Yes.     And if I may then just complete that and in doing so that would require of you to interrogate the rationale behind the MDS?     To then determine whether 1064 is a reasonable number under the circumstances contemplated in the MDS?     And only thereafter then you go into the business case which is to look at the cost of what the 1064 is expected to cost.     Okay, Chair I think that brings us to your teatime.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Chabi when we rose for tea we had just dealt with the concept of business case.  We are now leading onto your paragraph 5 of your statement at page 8 where you propose to deal with the 1064 financial model.  Now before we do that in detail that is another term.  Can you talk to us about the financial model and you might as well indicate its role in this entire transaction?    Yes so when you are giving the document the business case which you said you have annexed as AC2 without the financial model are you able to validate that business case?    Okay.  Okay then we are now in the business case itself relating to 1064.  And you have indicated to the Chair as you state at 5.2 that this is developed on a platform – common platform Microsoft Excel and you have that on your system and it is available to go on screen.    Now can you tell us specifically about what you now – this model which you refer to as a workbook.  How is it made up, what does it contain and how is it intended to be read?  And perhaps it might assist if you show us that model?    5.2 Chair at page 8.    Where he – I say he indicates that it is developed on a common platform called Microsoft Excel.  Thereafter you speak of the Excel based model, the workbook comprising of a certain number of worksheets and the modelling that is involved.    Would you like to talk to us about that?    Okay.  Okay we have it on the screen.    Not on the screen.      It will not be there Chair instead it is your annexure AC31.    At page 161 of the statement.    Now at AC31 we indicate that this – what we have submitted into evidence is the flash disc.    Containing this entire financial model.    Overleaf at – no that is at 160 I apologise.  At 161 we have given you a copy of what we call the first term of the financial model which is similar to what you have on screen.     It is best however at – to work with the version at 161 which is the A3 page and if you have reference to the A3 page you – as Mr Chabi intends to do you will be able to follow the various blocks in the Excel spreadsheet. Now at page 157 Chair of that statement there is a picture of a USB we did not have another way of presenting it to you.  We say that is the USB we are tendering.    As annexure AC3.    At page 157.1 overleaf we developed an index showing what is contained in that USB.  And what is contained there is the actual business case which is the one document and the second document is now the financial model.    Now at page 159.    At 159 we have listed – let me just take a step back.  The whole of that model – financial model is referred to as workbook.  The workbook is made up of a number of worksheets.  And at page 159 we have identified each worksheet separately and what that worksheet contains.  So that it is list – there are in total 55 of them.  You have in certain instances like tab 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 20.  They are highlighted in yellow. Those are hidden worksheets.  This is just so to understand what 59 – 159 is but we will not be getting into that detail.    So that was just to give you a sense of the structure.    Of this financial model.    Now what Mr Chabi has on the screen if the Chair would have regard to page 161?    The A3 paper. That is what Mr Chabi has on the screen.  And if one has regard to what we have on the screen that is the first term under the heading Base Case Output.  Okay.  After the Base Case Output is followed by a number of purple and there is red other worksheets and that is what makes up the actual calculations in respect of each item that was calculated to arrive at the 38.6 billion.    Okay we are now Mr Chabi at the Base Case Output and you have turned us to that.    Your mouse if on you can use your mouse too.    To point where you are on the screen.    Yes.    If you move slower perhaps.    I do not know if it is possible to ...(intervenes).     Enlarge the mouse.  Is it possible?      Are you able when dealing with any aspect of that spreadsheet to perhaps highlight it?  You can you do that?  As you deal with it so we know where exactly you are on the spreadsheet?    Ja.    The green line.    We are trying to see if there is a technical way.  But these are two lawyers advising each other.  It is very dangerous.    From another lawyer.  Okay.  Now the suggestion Mr Chabi is by way of example.  Let us look at your first entry under Productivity MGTK the first table.  That is where we want to speak about the existing fleet capacity.  You see that?    Are you able to click on that and highlight as we talk through it?    That might help.  Which is ...(intervenes).    So then we will do it as we go along.    Thank you.      Please continue.    And if you may do so then with reference to you statement starting at paragraph 5.4.  So we will read your 5.4 together with what you have projected on the screen or in otherwise what we have at page 161 of the statement.    Ja.    Yes.    Absolutely thank you.    Okay just then let us find firstly at page 161 on the business case output productivity MGTK.  On the screen where – which table is it?    At 5.4 you say the table titled Productivity MGTK.    Now you are dealing with that and I would like you to identify for purposes of our conversation to identify it on the screen.    That is the table you refer to at paragraph 5.4?    Okay.  Then deal with that table.    You do not have to go there at the moment.    We do not need to go to that particular.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    H’mm.    And if I may then on that required capacity it is broken down by year?    Yes.    Okay then the required capacity the last line you have on that table per annum would it be a correct understanding to say it indicates on an annual basis how much extra capacity is required?    Ja.  Or shortfall?    Transported. Not transported?    Yes.  So that is the demand that the MDS tells us we have to try and meet?    Okay.    Absolutely ja.    Go ahead.    Yes.    You accept – you accepted it as fact?    For purposes of you exercise.  You deal – you have dealt now with the required capacity and the existing fleet capacity and these you deal with at paragraph 4.4 and – 4.5 and 4.6.    Come again?    I say at your 4.4 – 4 .5 and 4.6 – 5.6 why do I keep on saying 4 I apologise.  5.5 and 5.6 including 5.7.    Yes.  So now we are – you have in part dealt with the contents of that first table.  Am I correct?    Okay.  You now lead us at your paragraph 5.8 to a table titled New GFB Diesel Locomotive Plan.    Yes.    No but then when you speak to it because you have elected to highlight certain tables please point out to the Chair the relevance of highlighting this particular table?    And the delivery period you have indicated was at least on this business plan 7 years.    Okay.    Okay.  You may proceed.  You then deal with Supply Production Capacity.    You said in year – in 14/15 it is 165 not 65?    As regards electric?    Okay yes.  Okay.  My apologies yes you correct 65.    So if we look at those two tables there and we know that the diesel locomotives plan is for the acquisition of 465 diesel locomotives and the electric locomotive plan is for the 599 – electric locomotives?    Delivered in those batches over a period of 7 years and that gives us the total of 1064?    Thank you.      Yes.  So is – when we look at this table it says Supplier Production Capacity should the Chair understand that to mean that speaks to the ability of each individual supplier?    On a monthly basis?    Okay.    Yes.  Okay.    Okay.  Now if one has regard then to the three tables as they follow each other the diesel locomotive plan, the electric plan and the Supplier Production Capacity.  The information set out in those tables is it in any manner relevant to the period of the project?  The 7 – the period of acquisition.    In any manner is it in – relevant to the fact that these were being acquired over 7 years?     We then can expect changes to occur if that period is brought down from 7 to let us say 3 or 4 or 5?    In the numbers per annum that are set out in these tables of locomotives?    Okay.  It would be included by that.    It is providing for – okay.  Thank you for highlighting that.  At 5.10 – paragraph 5.10 you deal specifically with the existing fleet.    As at 2013/2014.    Yes.    Yes.    And if we look at that you have under fleet type we need not really concern ourselves much about that 6E, 7E all that relates to the type of locomotives?    So what the model does for us is to tell us as at the time of development of this business model how many 6E’s, 7E’s and 7 E1’s were there?    Okay.    Yes.    So what this then tells us that we had a total of 1889 and we sought to augment that with a further 1064?    Okay.  You go further at 511 and you deal with a new tab or new table GFB Tariff Average.    Tell the Chair about that.    Okay.  Can you follow that with that with the volumes – net tons?    Huh-uh.    H’mm.    What we have done now.  You have chosen to highlight certain aspects of the financial model?    Okay and that has taken us to 5.12.  Considering the various tables that you have highlighted and discussed and in the context of what you state at your paragraph 5.13.  How would you describe these tables?  What do they reflect as opposed to the rest of the worksheets that you speak of at 5.13?  You made a selection of these specific ones to deal with in particular.  Why is that?    Yes.    Now in dealing with the tables in the business case output you did not discuss all the tables?    And what is the reason for that?    And what do those tables deal with that you did not discuss?    No.  No.  We are – I am just – want to help us understand the rationale for the approach you have adopted.    So you have excluded from the discussion currently any table or worksheet that deals with the revenue and the cost and the variables?    And you have dealt with every other aspect that is relevant to the determination of the business case?    Okay and you say because we will deal in more specific terms with the variables and assumptions and the costs and the revenue ...(intervenes).     And the NPV.  Okay.  What we have discussed so far is by way of background.  Right?    Because it is only at – from paragraph 6 at page 12 that we turn to the actual man – your actual mandate.  You – if one has regard to paragraph 2.1.1 where you have listed the mandate.  You have sought to give a heading to each one of them for brevity.  So    And this for purposes or our discussion if I read your statement correctly you will deal with the heading of “Review of the Business Case”.    And you have done that with every specific one – with every other mandate you were given?    Okay.  So then going back to our page 12 paragraph 6.  You deal then with the first – the review of the business case.  So – and I am sure we may safely close that Excel spreadsheet and deal more with words now.    If we turn then to our paragraph 6.    If it is not – if it is any consolation Chair you are not alone in that.    Yes.    Before you proceed so that we are able to follow you.  Perhaps you might want to put up slide 4 – slide 3 and slide 4.    Let us go to slide 3.  At slide 3 you have two entries there.  You have captured the mandate and you have captured the finding.  Okay.    And you indicate that your finding which is what you told us previously was that there are assumptions in relation to the variables you have found to be reasonable?    Now going to slide 4 will I be correct to say from this point onwards you are providing an explanation and a substantiation for the finding you make at slide 3?    Okay.  Then we are all ears Mr Chabi.    Yes.    Yes.    Very fine Chair.  I am closer to the mic now.    And perhaps I do not know if it is at all possible for Mr Chabi if he could speak slower perhaps.    If at all possible.    You – then at slide 5 – at slide 4 you are talking about the measures applied in appraise – appraising the business case.  At slide 5 you then talk to us about the variables making up revenue as per the business case and the variables making up cost as per the business case?    So if you could deal with those.    And if I may just clarify that escalation rate you speak of.  You derive from the financial model    Okay.    No.  It is fine.  You may continue and now we deal with the variables making up the costs of the business.    Okay.    Relating to slide 5 now.  What you have just done is talk to the – that is the left side of the slide which are the variables making up the revenue.  Now let us talk about the variables making up the cost.    Perhaps before you jump too far ahead in your statement, because we have just gone through the variables making up the revenue and the variables making up the cost and you told us about the measures applied in appraising the business case.  Maybe you must talk to what you state in your paragraph 6.4 which is    And it is in that table that you deal with your diesel TCO and your electric TCO.  So you may talk to us per line item.    Yes.    Can I – sorry to interject.  Can I put it in simple terms and say Net Present Value of 2.7 billion is the profit?    So that is the expected profit on this entire project?    Over the period?    Okay.    Before you get there.  Now those the diesel and the electric TCO, the costs, is it correct understanding that these are the costs I would have to incur to own and operate or just to own the locomotives?    TCO.    It is own and operate?    So if I am going to buy a certain number of locomotives at a particular rate taking all the variables into consideration.  I am calculating – you say it is calculated over the period in order for me to make my 2.7 billion profit.  It is – the total cost of my owning and operating a diesel – those diesel locomotives is going to come in at 22 billion?    For which I must deduct from the revenue?    Okay and I must do the same for the electrics as well?    Thank you.  You may proceed.    Okay.    Now in your – at your slide 6 you arrive at this NPV of 2.7 based on what you call a hurdle rate.  You have to take a hurdle rate into consideration.    Oh the business case.  You it is not directly who – Mr Chabi I apologise.  You are quite correct.  The business case.  Can you talk to us about the hurdle rate which is what you refer to at the top of that slide where you say? “The Present Value computation based on a hurdle rate of 18.56%.”    And if I may while you are thinking is it the rate discount rate?    The risk discount rate.  Then you talk about that as well and you help us distinguish the one from the other.      Okay is it coincidental that they both happen to be 18.56%?     Ja is it just a matter of coincidence that they are both 18.56 both the hurdle rate and the risk discount rate?     Okay.     Now you say the hurdle rate used here is 18.56 was that a prescribed rate and if so by what or is that a rate that is randomly used in the business case, where does the 18.56% derive from?    That’s what prescribes what the applicable hurdle rate will be?     So now this being Greenfields it had to be 18.56 so it was not open to whoever was working on the business case to decide that they are going to use a hurdle rate of 12?     It wasn’t it was a prescribed rate okay.  From your paragraph 6 of – now we understand how you arrive at the net present value and let me just check at this point you, by you I mean ALL5 having done your investigations you don’t take issue with the treatment of all these costs to determine the net present value?     Would it have the effect of reducing the NPV significantly or?     It would have increased it?     So are you suggesting this was a more stringent approach?     A different treatment might may have resulted in a higher NPV?     So because now they employed a conservative approach came out with a lesser NPV you are happy to accept that ...(intervenes).      There are no real issues there?     From your then paragraph 6.7 you say the second measure is the ETC, right and you made the point as your slide 6 shows us that the project was profitable at an ETC of R38.6 billion, you see that?     Now you take it from there and just to give you guidance if you go over at slide 7 at some point, that might be a slide that is relevant to the next issues you are going to discuss.     Yes.     So we know from what you informed us that at 18.5% hurdle rate there was a profit of R2.7 billion.     You increase that hurdle rate by 1% and you wipe out all profit?     To 19.6%.     And that hurdle rate would only drop the less risky the project was.  So you would use, let’s say a 17.6 right down, let’s say to 12 depending on the risk profile of the project.     And as it decreases then it gives you more profit?      Which you calculate at 12.6% would have been a profit of R34 billion?     Now there’s a significant difference or change between the rate at 13.6 and 12.6 it’s a – so that reflects – does that give a true sense of the value of that 1% difference in the hurdle rate?  There’s an impact, the 1% change has.     It’s the impact the 1% change of the hurdle rate has on the projected profit.     Okay you make a point about the ETC and what the ETC establishes and doesn’t establish.  What it considers or doesn’t consider and you say the estimated total cost speaks purely to cost and does not consider revenue and therefore is not a measure to determine profit?     Okay and you mention that it is inappropriate therefore to have regard to the ETC only in order to determine the profitability of the project?     Why are you pointing this out to us in particular?     There seems to have been – where was this please be more specific you say you speak in general terms that there seems to have been?     Ja for the record tell us again what memorandum this is?     And that memorandum is the memorandum to the Board of Transnet at the time on the 23 r d of May, thereabout 2014?     Seeking approval for the increase of the ETC from R38 billion to R54 billion?     And you are saying in that memorandum there seems to have been an over-emphasis on ETC?     In justifying the ETC?     And your view is that less attention was given to the profitability of the project?     To the totality of the project okay.  You then lead into your paragraph 6.8 and you talk about what you must address in order to determine the financial viability of the 1064 transaction, you see that?     Okay can we deal with that in brief and we are now dealing, I think, specifically with your variables ...(intervenes).      We have discussed this in reference to the slides yes, that would be slide 5 which is the slide which was dealing with revenue and variables making up revenue and costs.     Sorry, I didn’t hear that please say that again?     Yes.     We’ve dealt with that.       Okay then perhaps let’s deal with that.     Before we do Mr Chabi we have dealt with the volumes.     Which you deal with at 7.2 we’ve dealt with the distance the tariffs the costs you recall where we dealt with the total cost of ownership, revenue cost and the like.  We must deal with the total cost of ownership before you express an opinion on the reasonability of the assumptions.     The total cost of ownership, what you deal with from your paragraph 7.6.     Before you express an opinion on the reasonableness of assumptions we must deal with some of these aspects yes.     Okay and that, Chair, you’ll find at page 16 starting at paragraph 7.6.     Let’s leave that for later.     That was the exchange rate at the time?     Yes.     You deal with – just look at your 7.6.4.1 you give it in Dollar terms at 2.6 million for diesel and 3.5 for electric locomotives.     At an exchange rate of 9.5.     Okay.     Per locomotive?     And that is what you have to hedge?     Oh so it already includes the hedging cost?     Allowing for 2 – yes.  So if it were to be set out in an Excel Spreadsheet you say you are looking at the initial capital outlay, the acquisition cost right, would it be correct to say, in that acquisition cost the Chair should expect to be able to locate the base price of the locomotive, the localisation premium, I’m looking at paragraph 7.6.2, the escalations to the price, the hedging costs and contingencies.     And the cumulative of all that is what’s going to tell me what the acquisition costs, the pure acquisition costs are?     What the ETC is?     Yes okay, overleaf you deal – what you’ve just dealt with is an example – was a diesel locomotive and then the same process is repeated for electric locomotives which is what you deal with at page 17, are you still with me?     Okay and if you look at your paragraph 7.6.10 at page 18 there’s your 9.1285 that was your spot rate, that was exchange rate as at April 2013?     What is the source of that exchange rate or did you  ...(indistinct) that exchange rate that you have reflected here?       These figures?     And equally so then the forward rates as set out immediately below that at page 18 looking at 2014, 2015, 2016, 17, 2018, 2019 all those derived from the financial model?     And it applying those various rates amongst other that eventually, to the original locomotive price that will eventually lead us to the R38.6 billion?     Yes absolutely, the contingencies.  From paragraph 19 you deal with the detail of the cost.     Page 19 too many P’s I apologise Chair.  For the record your page 19 of your statement you then unpack the various costs, the personal costs, fuel costs, maintenance costs.     Yes.     And that detail we have dealt with in part, previously.     We don’t have to worry about – so now we have taken into consideration all the assumptions.     Maintenance costs?     Okay take us through that, talk to us to that.     And we will get to the relevance of what you point out later when we’re talking about the treasury curve rate.  For now, then we’ve considered the variables and assumptions that underpin the ETC.     Okay and you summarise these at your slide 8 and having taken us through that detail are you now in a position to express a view as regards the reasonability of these assumptions?     Yes.     If you could go to slide 9 then, you show us a graph there that reflects ...(intervenes).      That’s US?     You’re still speaking about SA okay?     How many?    160?        And the purpose – before I get to the purpose, slide 9 is what you produced it doesn’t come from the business case it doesn’t come from ...(intervenes).      Yes this is what you sourced?     Yes and the purpose was to see how the right – the correct rate which ought to have been the US PPI related over the period to the US CPI?     And the takeout from that slide must be that the differences between the two indices is slight – it’s a slight difference and the use of the US CPI did not unduly inflate or reduce the ETC, so it ...(intervenes).      It served to increase it but ever so slightly.     But using US CPI we come in at 38.6 billion looking at your graph what would you say would perhaps have been the right ETC using the PPI.     So 38.4 as against the 38.6 and what opinion do you express on that, the fact that they used the wrong index?     So then that now that we have looked at this particular issue, the inflation issue both local and foreign.     Are you then able, in your position now, to express a view on the reasonableness in the assumptions made in determining the ETC?     So the 2billion difference.     No, no my apologies my calculation it’s lunch time.     I say my calculation is entirely wrong, it’s the hour.  I said the difference between the two is negligible they are both 38 billion just that the other one is .55 and the other is 6 so yes.     Okay.     I was hoping we wouldn’t go much I just wanted him to – this is, I think the last point to conclude.     On his first mandate then.     No.     Thank you Chair then, if we may, apologies.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Chabi just before we broke for lunch we had completed and you had given your finding as regards one of the issues you were mandated to investigate. We now turn to the second issue which is addressing the actual ETC of 38.6 billion.  You deal with that from your page 27 at paragraph – from paragraph 9.11.  Now as is our practice before we deal with the detail of this ETC of 38.8 billion – 38.6 billion my apologies perhaps it might be appropriate to put up onto the screen slide 11.      And in this slide you summarise the mandate and your findings.  So if you could just quickly take us through that?    Yes.    Yes.    As you correctly point out we have touched somewhat on the reasonableness of the 38.6 billion.    For the 1064 and in this session we will deal with only those aspects that we did not perhaps cover before we broke for lunch.    But the bulk of our time on this issue will be spent on the question of whether or not the 38.6 billion included Forex Hedging and escalation.    Okay.  Now starting at your page 27 as I said paragraph 9.11 you then may take us through how you arrived at the finding that is reflected at slide 11?    Yes.    Yes.    So the revenue we have been considering of 9 billion over time – over the period was based on this four month delay.    The testing of the locomotives.    It accounted for that yes.    Okay.   We then now deal with the breakdown of the 38.6 billion specifically and for that purpose I think we should have regard to your slide 13.    Yes.    Help us here?  What we see on slide on 13 is a product of your work.  The slide as currently presented does not exist in any of the documentation provided you in the form that you present it at 13?    So this is as a result of an analysis you conducted of the financial model?    Now are you able to point us to the source of information that led you to the conclusions you draw on this slide?    Yes.    Okay.    You refer us to annexure AC4 at your paragraph 9.16.      Yes.  I – in that paragraph I picked up a little error.  I think the paragraph is incomplete.  It concludes that this annexure is titled in the financial model but does not give the title.    Is that not supposed to read in inverts TCO locos CAPAX.    Okay.  So we must add that.    Sentence at the end of paragraph 9.16.    At the end Chair of that paragraph.    9.16.    It should read what you have currently is this annexure is titled in the financial model but then does not give you the title.    So we propose to add the title and we do so by opening inverts we write capital “TCO”.    I shall    We will do so Chair.    But for purposes of the record at least just state the title of that annexure?    Okay.    Now you direct us to annexure AC4 and that starts at your page 162.  Now if you could just go page by page it is supposed, so we will start at 162 we may for our purposes ignore 163 correct?  Please check your page 163.    We may ignore that graph there.    Okay.    And you want in particular for us to have regard to 163.  Page 163.    The table.    Chair page 163 has got a table to the left and on the right is a graph.  We may ignore the graph for purposes of our discussion.  What is important is the table.  But the reproduction at page 163 is very tiny and difficult to read.  What we have done is we have reproduced a larger table which I beg leave to hand a copy in of.    And we propose that that be numbered 163.1.  it comes already numbered.    Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Chabi you intend to go to this specific worksheet right in order to help us understand how you arrive at the figures that you set out in your slide 13.     If you could take us there.    It is coming up.  No it is coming up.    There it is Chair.  Now it is coming up.    Yes.  Yes.    Now you will recall because now slide 13 – if the Chair could just keep it open slide 13?  At slide 13 you give us the total respectively of the locomotive price, the SAAPPI escalation cost, USCPI escalation cost foreign hedging and contingencies.    So you give us the totals for both electric and diesel and you conclude at the bottom with a total ETC of 38.6 billion.    So that we will keep handy and then you can help us work through this worksheet.    Would it be correct to say the worksheet you are referring us to supports the conclusions drawn at slide 13?    Okay.    Then – I part?    Okay then identify those parts and help us understand slide 13?    Okay.    That is our ETC.    Yes.    Okay.  Please proceed.    And by that you mean annexure AC4?    In our ...(indistinct) yes.    Indeed Chair.    The table yes.    H’mm.    And then ...(intervenes).     Sorry that 12.7 – is 12.7 million Rands.    Being the local portion of the 25.2 million.    Which is the cost of the locomotive?    And the 12.5 million is the foreign component of that price?    Translated into Rands?    Okay.  And you say that ...(intervenes).     The sum of those two give us 25.2?    That is how we determine that the price of the locomotive is 25.2?    Adding of course the – now the 12.7 for the local portion of the price has taken into consideration the 2% localisation already?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    And ja – but as you go further appears that the foreign component becomes higher.    Is there an explanation for that?    As at slide 13 ja.    Yes.      Yes okay.  Okay.      I think there is a principle that cuts across.  You perhaps can make an example with the diesel in 13/14 and then if that is applicable you then say we can apply the same principle across if not you will explain what principle to apply and then you can extend that same principle to the electrics.    So let us deal with it..    Example of the diesels ja.    Yes.    Ja you explain it to us yes.    Just make sure you are clear for the – for tomorrow’s reader of the transcript that they can follow what you saying.    518?    9.158?    And just to perhaps – we do not have to go to the – you can – you stated – just check your pages 18 paragraph 7.6.10?  You tell us that the spot rate as at 18 April 2013 was 9.1285.    Yes.  No 1285.    Ja.  Okay so now we have located our spot rate.    And we know the price then in 2013 was 2.6 million Dollars?    Yes.    Yes.    H’mm.    H’mm.    Ja.    Yes.    Now that 11 you say it is 11.146?    And that is the figure at your slide 13 under diesel for locomotive price you have rounded off to 11,147?    Okay.      So we can say at this juncture now we know that the ETC was 38.6. What we have done is to extract the cost of the locomotive free from all other associated costs.    So we know of the 38.6 the actual cost of the locomotives were 30.    Okay.  So then we look at the makeup of the difference between the two.    Yes.      Just scroll down or up.    I do not know what would happen.      You working off – okay.    H’mm.    H’mm.    And then that before you leave that row that number then changes in every successive year?    It goes up to 10.40.  Then goes to 10.52 to 11 and so forth until eventually in 2022/2023 it is at 14.30.    Okay.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    H’mm.    Okay.  Now you will recall while you are looking at the next issue that with reference to slide 13.  We at least have determined the PO price of the locomotive if they were they were acquired in April 2013 ...(intervenes).     And we know that we should have spent 30 billion according to the business case?    But the AGC that was actually approved was 38.6 billion and your reference to the slide is to demonstrate to us that the 38.6 billion is derived at by taking the locomotive price – total locomotive price and you add the inflation and you add the hedging.  This slide does exactly what you are talking about except that it does it on an individual locomotive.    What you have ...(intervenes).     On the slide.  So we are working – the slide works of one locomotive.    Yes.    Sorry.  Not the slide.  Let me say the ...(intervenes).     The worksheet.    Yes.  The worksheet works off one locomotive.  So it is one locomotive adding the 2%, Adding the PPI ...(intervenes).     Or ...(intervenes).     CPI as the case maybe ...(intervenes).     And then – yes and then hedging that part of the price that is in foreign exchange ...(intervenes).     And that will then give you the total price of that diesel locomotive inclusive of these two costs?    Okay.  When we go to slide 13 you follow the same thinking.  Except you do not start off with one locomotive.  You got the price for the locomotive and you multiply it by the number of locomotives in the diesel category and in the ...(intervenes).     Electric category.  You calculated the accumulative PPI across all the diesel locomotives and that is the – that is why you come up with 388 million.  That is for all of them at slide 13.    For diesel.  You do the same.  So whereas then this particular worksheet works per individual locomotive.  Your slide 13 is the accumulative based there of all locomotives split up into ...(intervenes).     Electric and diesel.    Am I right thus far?    Now you recall you took the Chair to a slide – no, to a worksheet where you indicated the 38.6 billion and you said that the Chair should take note of that cell.    Yes.    We are coming back Chair.    Yes.    It is just that you had flagged that other worksheet and I want us to remind ourselves the importance of that worksheet and its interrelation to this particular one.    That is on the screen.    Ja.    Yes.  Please do.  Please.    And you may move anyone of them.    I suggest perhaps we change the one that will demonstrate a significant change or at least a – you know.  Appreciable change to the 38.6 billion.  So which one do we ...(intervenes)?    Let us do the exchange rate then.    Huh-uh.    Let us do zero and I, because the question is whether or not the 38.6 billion took into consider – hedge that – exchange rate at all.    You know.  So the screen – the worksheet you have up there would appear to suggest that there was hedging involved which is what you took us through.    Okay.  Now let us remove all hedging and see what happens to the 38.6 billion.    Before you switch worksheets please remove all the hedging right through the years.    Let us all make it zero right across.    Okay.    So what you have just done is take out all the hedging.    Ja.   So what you basically are trying to communicate to us is what we see in the red cells there the total of 38.6 is intricately linked to this worksheet.  Any changes in this worksheet will change that 38.6 billion automatically.    And the NPV ...(intervenes).    So then getting back to your slide 13.    You then have set out the Forex Hedging.  Again in globular terms of diesel.  That is for all the locomotives over the period of acquisition.  For electric at 2.4 billion.  Similarly for all of them over the period of acquisition and you have a total figure of 3.358 and so that is the hedging cost of the foreign component – foreign exchange component of the acquisition of the ...(intervenes).     Locomotives over a seven-year period.  Okay and just like with inflation you are suggesting we must add that to our original locomotive price of 30.    476.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Coming again.    Yes.    H’mm.    Huh-uh.    And that is as a result of the manipulation of the actual forward curve.  Instead of reflecting the increasing exchange rate over the period.  You just used the consistent exchange rate?    Spot rate ...(intervenes).     And you applied it cross the seven years?    So you said assuming then that there was no change in the exchange rate you would have used the 9.1258 for seven years and that would have given you an ETC of 32 billion?    Okay.    I say the exercise you have just done now you assumed for purposes of this exercise that the exchange rate over the seven-year period will stay at 9.1258?    Yes.    285.  Okay.    1285.  That is correct.    There was no inflation right through.    Yes.    Okay.    Which is the final – the last entry on your slide 13?    Okay.    Then just to remind ourselves this – these spreadsheets we have been working on are the spreadsheets provided to us by Transnet?    These are the – this is the financial model where Transnet tells us that 38.6 billion you will see in the business case is underpinned by these calculations?    Would it be correct then to surmise that the inclusion of exclusion of the exchange – the hedging costs and the inflation from the 38.6 will be determined by these worksheets.  Not by – by anything else.  The worksheets will tell us whether or not the hedging is part of the 38.6 or not?    So any suggestion that the 38.6 billion did not include hedging or escalation must be rejected if the financial model is to be accepted?    You cannot accept both.    Because the financial model tells us it is inclusive?    And that is a long process we have just gone through and that Chair was a bit to demonstrate that the 38 – what the 38.6 billion included.  This issue will become relevant going forward when we discuss the increase from 38.6 to 54 billion, because time and again mister – as you heard previously from Mr Callard and Mr Sedumedi from MNS that there has consistently been a suggestion that the 38.6 billion did not include these costs and Mr Chabi today was trying to demonstrate to us that they in fact did and he draws that conclusion from the very worksheets the financial model provided to him by Transnet.  Okay.    Yes.    Sorry.  Let me hear you.    We are now back in slide 13?    I take it that you then have – you are able to show us with reference to AC4 the SA PPI escalation cost for the diesel and the electric.  That is the slide we are looking at.  The worksheet we are looking previously.  You equally showed us the US CPI?    Showed us the Forex and you allowed for contingency?    Now as I indicated that worksheet shows us all those costs but in respect of one locomotive?    Do we accept that your slide 13 then give – just gives us the total cost based on 1064?    The exercise you just took us through do you suggest that we take that exercise.  We apply it to electrics.  We worked on diesel.    Ja.  So why, but you say the same principle is applicable?    And once we have applied it to the electrical locomotives.  We will multiply by that number of electrical locomotives and it will give us escalation cost of PPI of 1.432 billion as per slide 13?    And that the total of 1.821 billion is a simple arithmetic exercise.  It is 388 for diesel, escalation plus 1432.    Which gives us 1821?    I think we understand.  I am will – I am happy to accept what you said.  Slide 13, but it is not for me to accept.  It is for the Chair.    The question I guess – the main one is whether your conclusions and findings at 13 are defensible with reference to the financial model.  Would you say they are?    Okay.  Then any clarification I guess that the Chair may require.    Okay.    Then justly before we leave your slide 13.  You have the last entry of total 2.232 billion for contingency.    Would you like to quickly talk us through that?    So the contingency of 2.2 billion you find reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances?    Yes.    Okay.  So we now have established through what we have discussed this afternoon that the 38.6 billion ETC was the locomotive price duly escalated in terms of the SA PPI and US CPI.  Taking into consideration the hedging costs and contingencies and that is how we arrive at 38.6?    At your slide 14 then you give us a comparison of foreign currency forward rates.  That is slide 14.  Could you quickly explain to us why you find it necessary to share this piece of information with us and the graphs?    Before you go into any further detail.  Can you explain each ...(intervenes)?    Each one?    Ja.  The difference between each one.    Yes.    Now before you move on.  When we dealt with Annexure 4 at page 163.1 you highlighted the foreign exchange futures on that very worksheet.     The exchange rate – the hedging, you see the hedging on the Forex shift.     Ja and you indicated to the Chair that that is the hedging.     The forward curve, do you know where Transnet obtained those figures from?     No Transnet.     From the Treasury Department so just talk to us about that, the Treasury Department provides SOE’s or what does the Treasury Department then provide?     Okay so these are as determined by Treasury?     Now if you could pull up your slide 14.     Yes 15 apologies, why is yours 15 and mine 14 – yes I’m looking for that slide headed comparison of foreign currency forward rates.  You have Transnet forward rates and Bloomberg forward rates.  You touched a bit on forecast rates we will get there.  Just explain to us what it is you are doing here with reference to the Treasury curve rate?     So then what conclusion do we derive from that slide?     To get to the 38.6 billion?     And that, as we said, we see in Annexure 4 AC4 at page 163.1 it’s those figures, 9.5, 9.10, 10.04, 10.52 and you have plotted them in a chart here on the slide and you compare them against the Bloomberg rates and I see that if there is – there are differences sometimes it’s ...(intervenes).      And the figures in blue, those figures we get from the model?     The Transnet forward rates, overleaf you then make another comparison which is forward rates versus forecasted rates.     And you make this comparison in this slide to demonstrate that the 38.6 billion was arrived at not with reference to forecasted rates but to actual forward rates, that’s the first point.  The second is, you acknowledge that the business case does make use of forecasted rates.     Except those rates are confined strictly to the issue on maintenance?      And in the previous slide you then said, if we accept that I have demonstrated that the rates used as the forward rates obtained from Treasury Department I have compared those against the rates I obtained from Bloomberg and they are more or less in line with one another?     Would that be a correct summation?     Okay you then go further in that slide and in your statement give us more detail – forward.     Yes.     Then you reach – we now have worked out the makeup of the 38.6 billion, we have calculated the escalation rate, the Forex, we have demonstrated that what was taken into consideration is actual forward rates and not forecasted rates and now we must draw a conclusion from that exercise and what is your conclusion?     And I think we have indicated earlier that any suggesting that the 38.6 billion did not include Forex hedging and escalation you would reject outright?     With that conclusion then we have disposed of the two issues that you were required to investigate and comment on so far as 1064 is concerned and we are now at your page 36 of your statement where we are dealing with the third aspect which is the increase in estimated total costs from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion.     36 Chair.     36.     Okay?     There are a few and unfortunately we are about to get more, there’s no warning.     We shall soldier on, this ...(intervenes).      No count me out Chair I’m not going there.     Did you want to say something before we ...(intervenes).      Okay we are now at your page 36, slide 18 right.     And your mandate now – you were now looking as I said at the increase in ETC from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion?     We are looking at the increase from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion.     Earlier you corrected me and said it’s .9 I said .5.     And you start this at your slide 18, statement page 36 starting then at your paragraph 9.47 can you take us through the issues relevant to this particular enquiry and help us work through it and understand how we arrive at an increase of 15.9 billion before you express a view thereon?     We don’t have a finding on this one we work through the issues before we get to the finding.     Because of the nature of the enquiry you know, so I guess we will go straight into dealing with the issues that are relevant to this determination.     We are happy to and by memorandum you’re referring to your Annexure AC5 starting at your statement page 164, is that so?     Marked AC5.     It starts at 165, it’s a memo to the Transnet Board is that the memo you are talking about?       I was clarifying is that the memo you are directing us to?     Okay the Chair has located it as well.     Before you go into the Executive summary just so that everyone can follow, what we are reading or what we’ll be reading under the Executive summary is captured in your slide 24 perhaps you might want to run ahead a bit and bring up slide 24, am I correct?     Yes so I say when you deal with the Executive summary in the memo it should be with reference to slide 24.     So that everybody can follow what you are saying.     Yes.     May I suggest we deal first with the Executive Summary and then we go to table two being a more involved table and try and then we will try and link it back to this table under the Executive Summary.     So on your screen then if you could go to slide 24 for this purpose we shall revert to this one, yes thank you.     So if one tries to understand this table in layman’s terms, would I be correct to say the ETC had to increase because one of updated economic factors of taking into consideration Forex and escalation as listed there.     The TE scope and the contingency except what changes is the amount of the contingency because our original business case had to take into consideration contingency but that in all this there has been a saving of 6.5 billion?     Would I be correct in interpreting it in that way?     Okay have – do you in your report deal specifically with this saving, are you in a position to assist the Chair to locate where this saving comes from?     You can’t pick up a saving?     Why not?     Okay then let’s do it that way because we would like to be able to follow and see this saving of 6.5 billion and while I’m at that – because I would expect, correct me if I’m wrong, that I must apply that saving to the increased ETC, I must have my saving of 6.5 billion and I would like you to help us work through the memo to show me how that saving is applied to whatever new cost there is.     Okay so if you can.     Yes.     Absolutely, okay.     Okay and table two you mean table two of AC5?     Of Annexure AC5.     AC5, we are back in our ...(intervenes).      AC5.     And Mr Chabi you are referring us to a table?      Yes.     With your permission that table two Chair is to be found at page 169.  Now Chair what you have at page 169, I think was not meant to be read we have ...(intervenes).      it was not meant to be read.     As in reading the print is so small we have extracted from the reference bundle a copy of that table presented better it is exact the same and we propose to hand it in as 169.1, this will facilitate working through the table than relying on the original table in the memo.     I’ve just paginated it 169.1 Chair.  Do you have a legible copy of that before you Mr Chabi?     No it’s not exactly the same thing this is your worked on document.     Okay for the moment the Chair should ignore what is on the screen he should listen to you as you assist him to work through table two that’s what we want to – you sent us to table two so ...(intervenes).      Yes Chair, 21, 22 and we will come back to that because that particular slide already includes an opinion, his opinion so I think it would be a bit – a tad confusing to seal with it at this juncture, we will get to it so it’s best we work our way through table two.  Now as the Chair said we’re working through figures; it’s been a day of figures.     We don’t have a choice, it’s 15    The next half an hour?     Because I ask this question Chair, because if we leave table two hanging and try to pick it up tomorrow – so when we engage with table two we take it all the way.     Yes Chair.     Is there Friday Chair?     Then the only choice we have Chair, I wasn’t aware of that, because we actually had more witnesses lined up for you tomorrow.     4, 5, 6, there were witnesses subject to your confirmation.   May I propose something Chair?       That perhaps we consider going to 18    I’m conferring here, I’m seeking counsel.     I’m advised, maximum two hours including 0 transaction.     That’s the advice I get Chair.     Mr Chabi shakes his head and I shall be led by him and this is – I guess my concern is this is the one aspect based on the mandate he was given.  The Chair will recall that as far as two are concerned he said he did not have a difficulty this is the one aspect that he has serious difficulties with and this is – it’s quite important to understand the basis for that conclusion and we would need to work through it.  So I too am very concerned that we can work through it in two hours.     No, no I don’t – Mr Chabi – it took me more than two hours to even get a sense of what he’s talking about let alone understand.     I’d say four hours half a day.     Yes Chair.     I was going to make a proposal; I know the line-up for Tuesday originally when Tuesday was set up it was supposed to be – those two witnesses were supposed to be for half a day.     May we then take the 5 t h because – may we then take the 5 t h because – Wednesday the 5 t h because the Chair, is it the 5 t h – Wednesday the 4 t h because the Chair is expecting for a witness to be presented on the 4 t h and no firm plans have been made in that regard and – no firm plans have been made about that witness or witnesses for the 4 t h and ...(intervenes).     No they come on the 3 r d, they come on the Tuesday.     So there are two for Tuesday there are two for Wednesday.     Yes and I’m saying ...(intervenes).      No Chair I don’t.     No I was talking about the witnesses for Tuesday, those are the witnesses I thought may be short.     And Thursday the 5 t h?     Thank you Chair.     And it’s now 15    Okay.     Do we take it at 16    Ja.    So that when we get into table two we try get all the way to the ...(intervenes).       Thank you Chair.    Chair before I answer that may I say something because during the break.    We were conferring.  Yes.  And we were looking at whether we are capable of realistically dealing with this aspect in one hour.  Would we be doing justice to it?  We have a choice of dealing with it at a very high level and that will not be doing justice to the topic. The sense is that we will not finish it in one hour.  When we reconvene the time between when we stop and reconvene will require us to rehash what we do today in order for the remainder to make sense.  And that is what we are trying to work through and we are in your hands at this point.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    I think three hours would be a fair amount of time.  If the Chair will recall we are still dealing with 1064 we then need to go to 100.  But as Mr Chabi indicated his mandate on 100 was a narrower mandate.  It is not as involved as with 1064.  So insofar as 0 is concerned we need very little time. We could just highlight the key issues.  The bulk of the principles that emanate from this 1064 are applicable to 100 so we could just by extension deal with 100 in that manner.  So if we were to perhaps take an hour today and try and find another two hours to complete next week it might help.  The concern we had was the break between when we finish today and when we reconvene.  That it should not be too long otherwise we have to rehash this hour for that evidence to make sense.  But if we – there is a possibility we may come back on Tuesday then it is doable Chair. Then it is doable.    No.    The view was the remaining portion of his evidence insofar as 1064 is concerned is best dealt with in one fell swoop in order for it to make sense.    If it is broken the longer the break between when he appears.    The more likely the need to rehash again – restart.    Next time we reconvene.    Preferably.    Preferably yes.  Because it is a singular topic now.     It is a single topic that we are dealing with.    Yes.  And then that would be enough to complete his evidence?    It would.    We could find in the interim means and ways of perhaps presenting the evidence on transaction 100.    In a quicker manner.    But like I say all the principles would have been established through 1064.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    On Tuesday.  On Tuesday yes Chair.  Our best bet would have been on Wednesday subject to whether or not the witness the Chair referred to who has been served with summons.    Is able to appear.    And I do not know where do we get the answer for that.    Yes Chair.  We start at 09   To 12   Or maybe sooner if we find a better way perhaps of ...(intervenes).     Or maybe before 12   If we find a better way of ...(intervenes).     Working through it.    We had anticipated but we may be wrong that both of them would be a – would be half a day witnesses.    But we could be wrong.    Beyond twelve yes Chair.    We will aim for 11   So then perhaps the Chair can have a 15 minute break.    Before then he  ...(indistinct) the other two witnesses. Yes Chair.    The 4 t h December yes.    Now we happy with that arrangement Chair.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.    Ja okay.    Okay.    I guess we will – I guess we will have to start afresh with his evidence.    Yes.    Ja, ja.    Ja.    Is 2 – does 2 have a yellow divider?    Oh no not on mine.    Yes.  They must make sure what I have is exactly the same as what you have and what the witness has is exactly the same.    Because you should – you should be able to say it is a white, yellow, blue divider.    And when I go there I must find that colour.  You must not have a yellow divider and I have a green divider.    So it just makes things easy because you see for example now I saw that the first divider number 1 is yellow.  So I am looking for another yellow that has got 2.    Because that is how normally it goes.  But actually you probably have a yellow number 2 and I got a green number 2.    You see.    But the people who do these things might not appreciate the importance of these things.  So they need to be told that the files must be exactly the same so that when we are looking for any document we have exactly the same thing.    Ja.    Ja okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja okay.    Yes okay, okay.    H’mm.    H’mm.    H’mm.    H’mm.    H’mm.    Yes.    H’mm.    H’mm.    Ja.  Yes no, no that is fine.  That is fine. I – the qualifications are already there.    So I am quite happy with him starting afresh in regard to the evidence.    Ja.  Ja.    Ja okay.    Yes.  The file – lever arch file containing the statement by Mr Alister Ouemakoua Chabi is going to be admitted as Exhibit BB8 and what falls under 1 are his statement and certain annexures, is that right?    Ja.  And under 2?    Yes okay.  Then his statement appearing from page 1 under divider 1 and the annexures that come after that but before divider 2 will be admitted as Exhibit BB8B1.    And his statement under divider 2 and the annexures thereto will be admitted as Exhibit BB8B2.    Did we get it right?    Okay alright.    H’mm.    Yes remember ...(intervenes).     Yes.  1064 being the – being a reference to 1064 locomotives.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay thank you.    H’mm.    Yes well ...(intervenes).     We must administer the oath or affirmation first.    Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.    Now Ms Sello I want us to begin this evidence in a certain way.    Which I think will help me.    I do not know about you.  You might be an expert on this thing already.      So Mr Chabi I want you to listen to what I am say – I am going to say.  Ms Sello is also listening.  I am going to tell you how I would like us to start with your evidence and you can tell me if you think we can do it that way from your point of view and Ms Sello will say something if she wants to say something also.  This is not so easy to follow stuff.  I am sure you are saying but this is nothing.  It is simple. It is a – it is – it has got its complexities for somebody who is not in this field. Certainly for me but I would like to follow it.  Now what would help me is if were to start with you telling me what the general principles are that apply when you do what you were asked to do generally speaking.  To say generally these are the principles that would be applicable in this field if you are going to do this.  This is what this principle means, this is what this principle means, this is what this principle means.  And then once I understand the general principles then when you go to the application of those principles to what was before you – to what is before us then I would follow much better.  Now in your statement there are certain things that I see as possibly principles.  So let me make you an example from a lawyer’s point of view.  Let me make an example about employment or any contract.  There would be two parties and the contract would talk about what they have agreed.  Who will do what, who will do what, what are the rights and obligations of the parties.  When do you have a breach of the contract and if there is a breach of the contract what does the other party – what rights does the other party have?  What remedies does it have?  When is there a breach, where is there no breach?  Let me make an example in regard to the contract.  The lawyers in the room will understand this but you will understand the two.  For example in the law of contract there is a principle which is the principle of reciprocity which means that in regard to certain matters in a contract if you are supposed to do something – a certain thing before I have to do something else or if you must do something for me before I can do something for you.  If you do not do your part I am under no obligation to do my part. You understand that?  So you cannot not fulfil your obligation but expect me to fulfil my obligation.  If you do not fulfil your part you are in breach but I am not in breach by not doing my part because I am only in breach if you have done your part.  You understand that?  Let me make you another example with contracts.  If we have a contract and I want to terminate the contract there are two possibilities.  I can terminate the contract by giving you a notice that says for example, I will terminate this contract on such and such a date and I give you about a month or three months depending what the contract says.  That is the notice period.  But I may also terminate the contract summarily without giving you notice and say, with immediate effect this contract is cancelled.  If as a general principle you are in breach – in a serious breach of the contract – call it a repudiation of the contract I can summarily cancel it.  But if you are not in breach of the contract I must give you notice.  You understand?  So if you look at it from – if you look at – if I explained this to somebody who is not a lawyer then having explained this I can then say well let us go to the facts of this case.  Okay was there a breach?  No there was no breach so therefore there is supposed to have been a notice before the contract was cancelled. Was there a breach?  If there was a breach there was no obligation to give notice.  It could be cancelled immediately.  So if I understand those principles it is easier to then go and say okay what happened here?  How does it fit into the general principles? And there may be exceptions that this is a general principle but there are exceptions. Now I do not know whether within your field it is possible to explain things like that but I would imagine that it ought to be possible.  But I am not an actuary so I do not know.  So tell me is this going to be easy or is it difficult or what do you think?    Ja I do not know what is happening I – maybe bring it closer.    So I can hear you.    Well certainly one of things that I would like you to do is to say, here are terms that I will be using in my evidence which are important to understand.    In order to follow the evidence.  I mean like in my example of a contract and talking about repudiation I would explain what repudiation means and I would explain what summary termination of a contract means.  That kind of thing.  So if we have the ex – and explanation of those important terms then it helps also to understand because one can – as the evidence proceeds one can go back and say okay this is what this one means.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  What is your input here?  Give me your input?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, no, no I do not want him to go there.  I was just ...(intervenes).     Ja ja I do not want you to start explaining any terms.    I just wanted to find out whether having heard what I have said you think for you it would be easy to do that or not, that is what I wanted.  Then once we are done then we can start.    It is doable?    Okay alright.  And how do you feel about it?    Oh you think we are in actuary 101 and you are already in 103.    I am 0.    Yes.  No that is fine. But that explanation of important terms at the beginning is important even before you go into much.  Just – it may be that it will not be.  It does not have to be all the terms that we will come across during the course of your evidence but certain important ones and then when – we move on.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.  No that is fine.  As long as the important ones you start with that and deal with them after you have confirmed give me those and then the list will not be exhaustive as you would go on and more come up then you can deal with them and explain them as we go along. But certain important ones I think it is important for us to do it that way.    Okay.  Maybe by – maybe if you are a good teacher Mr Chabi by the end of today we will be ready for actuary 103.    Ja.    Okay.  Let them switch off the air conditioner.  When you speak.    I do not hear you as clearly as I should and I do not know if it is the air conditioner.  So but they will switch it for now.    Just say something again?    Ja let – can the technicians – do the technicians know if everything is perfect.    They say everything is perfect technically.    Yes.    I think move it a little – away a little bit.  I think it is too close.    I think that seems better.    Well I asked them to switch it off.    Ja.      Okay alright.    Ms Sello I just want to say this because I have been reminded of it.    You know I think the Legal Team should try and make sure that all files – lever arch files that we – that are handed up on the outside – on the spine.    They are written what work stream.  Like this one should have Transnet. So when there are 50 files I can know these are Transnet’s so I do not have to look at any one of them if I am looking for Denel file.    A Denel file.  So Transnet, Denel, Eskom.  Ja because otherwise sometimes I might not remember that Mr Chabi gave evidence in regard to Transnet many months from now.    Ja.    And share the information with the Legal Team.    Okay.    Please switch on your microphone.    Ja.    Actually the statement if an affidavit I see at the end.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  Ja.  H’mm.    ETC?    Yes.  Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    I do not know whether it is your voice.  May it is not the – maybe it is your voice.  Maybe you need to speak a little slower.  I am not sure and a little louder.  Maybe this microphone does not want me to hear what you have to say.    So let – ja.  Let – try – let us see how it goes.    Ja.    Well you need to explain the essential important terms, but I also would like you to say these are the principles and it may be that the terms that are important to understand are linked to certain principles and if that is the case.  It is – you are welcome to say well ETC this is what it stands for. There are some – there is some principle or a principle that is connected with it and this is what I will – what it is and so on.  So how you deal with it I want to give you flexibility.  As long as in the end I have got that.    Ja.    Yes.  Well what – whatever you have done now is working, because I can hear you quite well now.    So stick to it.    Sorry.  Estimated ...(intervenes).     Total Cost.    Yes.    If the locomotives were to be acquired all at the same time is the position that you would not have ETC, because you would not have to estimate anything.  You would have total cost and you would know what they are, because you are talking about acquiring the locomotives.  You know how many there are. You know how much each is.  You know on what date you will receive them.  Delivery will happen. You know what the transport costs will be for them to be transported from China or wherever to South Africa.  Therefore you will know total – the total cost and not an estimated cost.  Is it – would that be correct to understand it that way?    Because there is the process of manufacturing?    If – but ETC would not apply to something that you can go and buy and take delivery of immediately?    It should not?    Ja, because you look and you see what the ...(intervenes).     What the cost – the price is.  Maybe it is something that will require you to hire a certain mode of transport to take you to your factory or home.  You then know what the cost of taking that will be and if that were to be the case would that come under total cost as well or would total cost be limited to the purchase price?    H’mm.    You would include it?    Ja.    Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.    Yes.    Yes.  It may be that I am thinking of something else in your statement.  I think which has got ownership costs ...(intervenes).     And so on.    Ja.    Yes.    Okay, because maybe when we come to that and you talk about that at the right time.  As I was thinking about it if I have to go and buy a certain article which requires me to hire a special vehicle that must take it to my factory.  Then in order for me to own that article and be able to use it I have to incur the transport cost to take it from where I bought it to where I need to use it.    Ja.    Ja.    Oh.  Okay.    No.  Thank you.  Yes.  You may continue.    What on the price?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    H’mm.    H’mm.  H’mm.  Okay.    I am sorry Mr Chabi.  Can you speak a little away from the ...(intervenes).     The mic.    I want to see when it is that I hear you quite well and when it is that I cannot ...(intervenes).     Hear you so well.    Just sitting from that distance.  Let me hear.    I think it is better.  Ja.    Ja.    Ja.  That is certainly better, you can leave that distance.  Ja.    So it is protection against risk?    Ja.  Okay.    Yes.  Okay.    Okay.  That is fine.    I suspect it does not, because it is just an explanation of the terms.    Without saying it comes about because there is this principle or this term arises because of this problem and the principle that applies in regard to this problem is the following.  So – but I do not want to make anything difficult.  If from your point of view you think there are some principles that you can deal with now or it is easy to deal with them as we go along.  That is fine.  What – how do you feel?    Yes.    Okay.  Alright.    Yes.  Okay.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes.  Okay.    Is that going to be here?    Did I not confuse things when I was admitting this.    Oh.  Okay.    This is one and two.    Yes.  Okay, but has this been admitted previously?    Oh.    Okay.  Okay.  So I go to page 5 of the statement, but I have available to me – I have to look at what page of ...(intervenes).     Slides.    Two?    Ja.    Just raise your voice again and move – maybe you can move the mic a little bit further from you.  I know we said you must bring it closer, but each time I am gaging when I cannot hear you well.  So – ja.  If you can then just speak a little bit away, but raise your voice again.    I am sorry.  I am sorry.    When you said AC1.  It is ...(intervenes).     Ja.    Later on you said when you read AC1.  It sounded like 81.  So I was wondering     The page is 52.  Okay.    I do not what the technology is doing to us today.  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    Ja.    Ja.    Has it become ...(intervenes).     Hot?  Is it hot?    Is that so?      With your jacket off it is manageable.    Okay.  Alright.  Ja.  No.  It is just that when the air conditioner is on.  It makes ...(intervenes).     It is more difficult to hear you.    But we see as we go if it becomes too hot for everyone.    Yes.    Would it be right to say that must be natural because you assume that the client knew what their needs were if they said 64 it must be that’s what they want or would it be normal to interrogate that even?    Okay.    Well when you have to interrogate the business case wouldn’t that ordinarily mean in the context for example of 1064 that you would also interrogate the issue of has a case been made out for the need for 1064, which is the issue we dealt with earlier on, you said you didn’t go that far because it seems to me on the face of it that you ordinarily give, if you are going to interrogate the business case it should include whether there was a proper or justifiable need for that number?    Yes, what I am saying is as I understand the business case for this what it means is you look at the justification that is advanced, is that right, for the costs and the whole project?    Yes, so what I am saying is on the face of it, it seems to me that one would expect that one of the things you would then interrogate is on what has been written in terms of the business case was there really a need or was there a case made out for 1064 as opposed to 500 for example?  So I am just asking you whether am I right to say ordinarily one would expect that when you interrogate the business case that would include that issue and not exclude it, but maybe in this case your mandate didn’t require you to go into it.    Yes, but if the – if it didn’t restrict you, you would go into that?    Okay.    Yes, we will take the tea adjournment and resume at    Okay let us proceed.    Is it basically how it is proposed the project would be financed?    Ja.    That it will bring.    H’mm.    H’mm.    So it is about the revenue?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.  Okay.    Not how it is financed is not part of the model?    That would be something else?    Okay.    Okay.    It helps Ms Sello if I know where about in the statement you are?    Oh okay.    I am sorry what page is it on this?    Or is it not here?    Which is at page?    Okay I have found it.    H’mm.    H’mm.    Yes.    H’mm.    Okay.    Okay thank you.    H’mm.    Ja okay.    H’mm.    H’mm.    H’mm.    H’mm.    You do not have something that he can use to point.    That we can     So ...(intervenes).    Ja to say this is what you are on now.    Well it is very small.    I guess there is nothing we can do about it.    Okay we will just do the best we can with what we have.  It is okay.      Ja.    It is just that it would be better if as you say it could highlighted or something but if it cannot be done we will make do with hat small arrow.    H’mm.    Well maybe we can do with fresh ideas from.    That is much better.    Yes, yes.    What should?    H’mm.    Yes.    Yes.    I must confess.  Spreadsheets are not my favourite thing.    Yes.    Let us try this again.  If you move the mic a little further away from you.  Just move it to the furthest point with the file.  Let me see how with the file.  Move the file as well to the almost furthest point of the table.  Okay.  Just speak and let me see ...(intervenes).     How it is?  I hope that those at the back if they are disadvantaged if you put to the mic too far.  They will give me some indication.  Okay.  Just speak.  Just speak and let me see.    One second.    How it is for everybody?  Is it fine?  Oh.  At the back they say it is fine.    For you Ms Sello?    Okay.  Alright.  Let us do it that way and just raise your voice a little bit.    Yes.  I think this will work well as long as your voice is at the right level.    The moment it goes down it might not.  So just bear that in mind.  Okay.    Yes.  May ...(intervenes).     Maybe even that as well.    Okay.  Thank you.  Yes.  Proceed.     Yes I’ve got it.     You said from paragraph?     You didn’t realise we have gone ...(intervenes).      Yes okay do that.     Okay.     Yes we’ll take the lunch adjournment and resume at    Okay let us continue.    And you could switch on your microphone as well.    What do we add?    9.?    Ja.    H’mm.    Okay shall I arrange that replace it with an amended page?    You give me an amended page.    That would replace. Ja.    Okay.    Ja.    Oh okay.    Is what you have on the screen now 163.1?    Oh.    Oh okay.    Yes.    Yes.    H’mm.    Yes.  In particular we are going to 163.1 or?    Indeed okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Please raise your voice again?    Mr Chabi some of these – the application of some of these numbers one will understand when one goes through your evidence     Very slowly in a transcript.  Yes.  Yes.  Continue.    No.  No fault with you.    No fault with you, but some of them you know one needs to ...(intervenes).     To spend some time.    Look at a hard copy.  At least people like me not on a screen.  Look in a hard copy.    Try and follow it properly.    The application of percentages and all of that.  Yes, but continue.    Are we moving away from 163.1?    We are coming back to it?    Okay.    H’mm.    Ja.    Thank you.    Okay.    Thank you.    I am sure there is a good chance that there will be questions for clarification after going through the transcript at my own pace.    Ja.     Just repeat that please?     You said that takes us to what page of the statement?     Page?     36 Okay     I’ve done a lot of numbers today, okay alright.     They have to be done ja we – let’s continue.     You didn’t say that to go to law one must go and do actuarial science 101.     Yes.     Is that the memorandum from Group CEO?     AC5 Ja, it’s a memo ...(intervenes).      Ja it’s from the Group CEO, yes.     Is that – did you say what page on the Annexures?     AC5?     Okay.     Did you say was not meant to be read?     Red in colour, read as in reading.     Okay.     Is it the same thing over there?     We’ve got this on the slides at page 21, what’s on the screen.     We don’t have a choice today we have to continue with figures.     You talk about tomorrow, there’s no tomorrow.     There’s no Friday either.     Well I don’t know what happened but even with Mr Chabi I had to ask whether he would need the whole day then I was told that definitely he would need the whole day but in terms of the programme for this week, tomorrow and Friday I was told there would be no witness and Monday, the next hearing is Tuesday the 3 r d, Wednesday the 4 t h and I’m not sure whether on the 5 t h there is already a witness or something is still being worked out?     Ja I can’t remember about 5, I know 3 and 4 are confirmed and I know who the witnesses are.  I think I may have said something must be done to explore the possibility of getting a certain witness on the 5 t h but I can’t remember where that process is whether it’s finalised or not and I said to Mr Pretorius because Monday and Tuesday this week – Monday and yesterday he was supposed to lead three witnesses, he only managed to lead two.  I said to him the third one he could look at – I don’t know whether I said the 5 t h or the 6 t h I may have said the 6 t h because I said we need to finish with him.  So I was never made to understand that we need another day for Mr Chabi and ...(intervenes).      Ja.     We can’t go beyond 17    Yes.     Maximum?     Is it minimum or maximum?  I just want to make sure nobody made a mistake.     You say you are comfortable with two hours?     Yes so what is a reasonable estimate of how many hours we need to – or let me say from where we are now, let’s forget     Four hours?     Well certainly ...(intervenes).      Well you see on – no, no Tuesday is a witness who could take half a day but I’m not sure I had thought even the witness with whom he was supposed to have come previously I would have thought half a day was good enough for him but he ended up with more than a day he had to come back the following day so it makes it difficult to estimate.     No on the 4 t h the witnesses – the two witnesses are coming.   Maybe we are talking about two different ...(intervenes).      Oh no, no, no there are two for Tuesday ja two for Tuesday.     And the one for the 4 t h summons was issued and no arrangements or application has been brought so as far as we know he should be here unless you know something that has not reached me.     So I think – but I think we are talking about the same witness when we said maybe he would take half an hour, was it the same witness?     No I was talking about the one for Wednesday.     Ja that’s the one that I say I’m not sure about but you see also a matter that I will be working on which will take most of my time Thursday and Friday and weekend and Monday, if it doesn’t get finished I might need every time possible. So you know when you use part of the day for a hearing it’s very difficult to do certain things that need focus and attention later it’s much better if you have got a – you set aside a day but I think that we might not be able to fix the date now but we should be able to find three or four hours before the end of next week.  If, for example the matter that I’m talking about, I’ve been able to give it attention and finalised by Monday then we could find Friday, I think Friday is the 6 t h we could find that we could use that but because this other matter needs priority I wouldn’t like to risk.  So if it’s not going to be too inconvenient to everybody, I would say, let’s continue     You can okay thank you.     Okay.     Are you able for us to work up until five?     Okay, well let’s take – we’ll take it at 16    Okay it’s nearly quarter to on my watch so ...(intervenes).      Oh is that so?     Okay maybe let’s take it now.     Okay let’s take – and we’ll resume at 16    Okay, we adjourn.    If we do an hour now up to 17   Yes something was discussed.    H’mm.  Well maybe let me tell you what I was thinking.    Then you can see how it fits into the discussion during the break that you people had.  I was thinking we could take an hour now do justice to Mr Chabi’s evidence then adjourn.  Then on Tuesday explore the possibility of starting early with him on Tuesday.    Say 09   Is the short answer that because of the time that may be necessary to refresh everyone’s memory the three hours would not be enough?    One hour today and two hours on Tuesday morning.    Oh okay.      Ja.    Okay.    So is the position therefore that three hours would be fine but it should rather be at a stretch?    And not one hour today and two hours on Tuesday.    Oh.    Okay.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.  Ja.  Ja.    Ja.    Okay.  The witness for – oh there are two witnesses on Tuesday.    Ja.    Yes.    You know I think Wednesday for that witness – I think it may be better that we start – we adjourn the hearing to – the hearing of Mr Chabi’s evidence to Wednesday.    To 12   Eh?    Oh ja maybe sooner.    Maybe sooner.    Maybe sooner.  But again Tuesday’s witness is – could be very – could be quite short even though there two.      Ja.    Maybe we should rather adjourn to Wednesday and we do the best we can to finish before the expiry of three hours if possible but if not at least we do not go beyond three hours.    Ja I think maybe we do that.  Is Wednesday’s suitable?  Are – would you be available on Wednesday?    You would be available.  So maybe that is what we should do and ...(intervenes).     Ja to try and finish 11   Ja.    Yes ja.  Okay no I think let us do that.  So let us adjourn then for today to Wednesday is the 4 t h I think it is.    Wednesday the 4 t h December commencing at 09   Okay.  Okay Mr Chabi we will adjourn the hearing of    Okay we adjourn. 
MR CHABI:  And we definitely will be communicating.  So this mistake will not happen again.    Those aspects are dealt with until page 5.    My full name is Alister Ouemakoua Chabi.    I do not.    I do.    So help me God.    Okay Chair so I am trying to marry I think the principles you have just mentioned to what sort of consequences ...(intervenes).     Is that?    Okay great.  Okay.  So I tried to follow as you went along and tried to jot down notes.  Would I be asking for much I asked about some of the terms you did not understand so I can go through that at a high level?    Okay.    Okay.  Okay Chair that is – I think I understand you.  I have off the top of my head picked up a few terms that I think will be pertinent in this submission and I think some of them are ETC.    One of the main ...(intervenes).     Okay.    I think I can explain a few of the terms used in the business in the submission yes I can Chair.    It is doable.    I picked up a few pertinent ones.    I thought were pertinent.  I can list them and then you can ...(intervenes).     Tell me if they are sufficient.    Am I audible now?    Hello.    Okay.    Does that work better?    A bit more.  And now?    Okay.    Correct.    Thank you.    I do.    It is.    Happy.    I do.    I do.    At this point no.    I do.    Okay.  Thanks Advocate.  So Chair just a few words I have picked up for purposes of definition are ETC.  ETC I think that occurs a number of times within the statement.  NPV and ...(intervenes).     ETC.    It appears     Terms Correct.    You are first dealing with terms.     Well I took terms to be ...(intervenes).     The principles in this instance yes.  And the Chair.    Okay.    How it goes.  Okay.    So I took terms to mean principles in this instance, because as to my understanding I think the difficulty is around the terms used in the business case.  What do these terms actually mean?    Okay.    So I hope the principles come out as I define the terms.    Hopefully will.  Okay.  So the terms I have picked up are ETC.  NPV being Net Present Value.  Escalation.  That appears also quite a number of times in the document.  Forex Hedging.  So foreign currency risk hedging.  I think …(indistinct) maybe another.    Okay.    Okay.  I like to mention that as we carry on with the statement I will continue to emphasise the definition.    Okay.    Alright Chair.  Okay.  So starting off with ETC.  What is ETC?  It stands for Estimated Total Cost.  In very simple terms and one of the slides speak to it.  It is the summation ...(intervenes).     Total ...(intervenes).     Cost.    It is the total or the sum of the cost of acquiring locomotives in each of the years over the delivery period.  It could be five, six, seven years.  In this instance in the business case it was seven years.  So each year in those seven years there was a cost to requiring locomotives.  ETC simply takes the summation of those costs.    Okay.  So if the locomotives had to be acquired all at the same time you would still have ETC.  Reason being in the business case assumptions had to be made about the price of the diesel and the electric locomotive.  That the assumptions on the price the OEM’s would charge. OEM in this instance being Oral Equipment Manufacturer.  So it is still an estimate because you do not know at the time of writing the business case what the manufacturers would charge you for the locomotives.    Not because they in the process of manufacturing, but because you – they have not given you a price for the locomotives.  So you would only know at contract stage.  I would say.  What they are actually charging you per locomotive.    It should not.  No.    You would know a cost if you can actually go out  ...(intervenes).     The cost is.    Purchase price.    It will be limited to the purchase price.    No.  No.  Total cost in this instance ...(intervenes).     Would be limited to the purchase price.    So we actually cover those details as you look through the model.    Looking at where ETC actually falls in the whole list of costs.    Right.    Total Cost Ownership.  Yes.    That is ETC ...(intervenes).     Including other costs.    Correct.  So the cost of operationalising ...(intervenes).     The equipment.    Does not form part of the ETC.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.  So ETC as we will discuss as well again later – is the purchase price of the locomotive.  Inflation on the price.    Inflation on the price.    In fact that is what we refer to as escalation in the statement.  Okay.  So escalation is synonymous with inflation in this instance.  Foreign currency hedging costs and contingencies.  So essentially those four items make up ETC.  In the business case you have a 2% localisation premium.  That is included as part of the locomotive price.    And in part escalation I suppose – inflation.    Correct, it is probably just inflation on the price that would have been quoted earlier.    So the price today is not the price a year from today ...(intervenes).     And that difference is what we refer to as inflation.  In most instances we get price increases and not price decreases.    NPV and I think before I go into NPV.  It is important to discuss what PV is.  Which is simply Present Value.  It is the value – it is the current value.  The value in today’s terms.  As I mentioned earlier the price today is not the price in a year’s time.  However the price in a year’s time can be discounted to give you a price today. If that makes sense and it is discounted at a certain rate.  That rate is termed the discount rate and normally with projects it is determined from a detailed risk assessment of the project.  So you assess the risk within the project and you arrive as a discount rate to quantify that risk and that discount which is then used to bring your cash flows back to current terms.  In the case of the business – in the instance of the business case it is 18 April 2013.    So if we talk about Present Value in the context of the business case.  We are referring to 18 April 2013.    Okay.  So NPV stands for Net Present Value.  In very simple terms it is – gives an idea of the profit you are likely to make on the project.  So you value your income or shall I say your revenue in today’s terms and so that is the Present Value of everything you expect to receive from the project.  Okay.  All cash flow that is coming in. You also value your expenses in present value terms and by Present Value terms I mean 18 April 2013 in the cost of the business case.  The difference between the two gives your Net Present Value.  So it is essentially the present value of your revenue net the Present Value of your costs and it gives an idea of your profit.    Okay.  So hedging essentially is a transaction you undertake to eliminate risk.  I can then also talk about partial elimination and so forth, but in the context of Transnet.    The mic.    Okay.    You cannot hear me.    Is it better now?    Is it better now?    It is better.  Okay.    Alright.  I think I was on Foreign Currency Hedging.  Okay.  So hedging essentially allows you to eliminate ...(intervenes).     So hedging simply implies elimination of risk.  In the cost – context of Transnet it is elimination of risk and now we are talking about foreign currency risk hedging.  So a transaction undertaken to eliminate foreign currency risk.  In the sense that you do not want to subject yourselves to fluctuations in the foreign currency in the future.  So you want to be – sorry.    Correct.  It is insurance.    In exchange rate risk.  So you know today what you are going to pay for that currency in a year’s time in two years’ time in three years’ time and so forth.  That is the point of hedging.  So if you hedge you are getting rid of your upside.  In other words if the currency does well you do not benefit from it.  If it does poorly you also do not suffer from it.    I think at this point not, but as we carry on if they come up.    Then we can deal with them.    So I will opt with then for dealing along – well ...(intervenes).     Dealing with them as we go along.    That is fine Chair.    Certainly Advocate.    Shall I take you through the mandate?   Okay. So maybe some context I suppose is ...(intervenes).     Important here and we will deal with it a bit later.  I suppose when we look at the increase in ETC.  So a memorandum was presented to the Transnet Board of Directors on the 23 r d of May 2014.  In justifying or requesting an increase in the ETC from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion. So there were reasons set out and quantum’s laid out next to those reasons to explain – to justify the R15.9 billion increase in ETC.  So MNS in the course of its investigations asked all five holdings to look through the reasons put forward.  Assess those reasons for reasonability.  Look through the quantum’s set out next to the reasons.  Also assess those quanta for reasonability and not only that.  To go back to that 38.6 billion and determine ...(intervenes).     Okay.  So just carrying on.  MNS then asked us in addition to the reasons put forward for the increase and the quantum’s put – set out next to those reasons to go back to the 38.6 billion.  So that was – that is 30 – the initial ETC presented to the board and assess – well determine if that ETC of 30.6 billion is reasonable – is justifiable.  So in other words looking through the variables. Looking through the assumptions and I suppose at this point I should explain what variables and assumptions are.  A variable is any quantity that can take any – that varies.  Actually it is pretty much that.  So in this instance when you are looking at revenue.  Revenue is set in subcomponents.  You have to make assumptions on those components. For example the tariff.  We will speak to that a bit later.  That is a variable, because that number can be anything.  In fact it varies from year to year as we will see.  The volumes are also a variable.  They change from year to year.  Okay.  So when we talk about variables we talk about those line items.  Okay.  So we look at revenue and revenue has its own set of variables. Costs also have their own sets of variables.  Escalation is also a variable in this instance.  Forex Hedging is also a variable, because Forex hedge changes depending when you actually contract or decide to hedge.  I think that is a better term.  So the mandate was to go and look at those variables within the 38.6 billion business case.  Well the business case relating to that ETC. Assess those variables for reasonability.  The assumption is the value you assign to the variable.  So inflation being a variable.  The assumption is the rate that you plug into that variable.  5% would be the assumption in this instance if five percent is the rate that you assigned to inflation.  So that is the difference between variable and assumption in this instance.  So we are required to assess both.    Correct Advocate.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Billion.  Yes.    That was the mandate.  Yes.    Correct Advocate.    Correct.    Okay.  So during MNS’ investigation of the 1064 locomotive transaction they came across the 0 locomotive transaction.  If that is the right  ...(intervenes).     Horrible.    It is getting hot.    It is okay.  It is fine.    It should be fine.  Yes.    It interferes with the ...(intervenes).     Okay.    It is the seat.    Okay.  So during MNS’ investigation of the 1064 locomotives transaction they came across the 100 and I think that was added onto their mandate from Transnet.  They then asked us as ALL5 Holding to looking into the 100 with the same mandate from the 1064.  However the validation of the initial ETC was not part of the mandate – of the 100 locomotives mandate. So if I can clarify that.  With the 1064 locomotives we had to validate the 38.6 billion and then look at the increase.  With the 100 the mandate was to look at the increase and not validate the initial 3.8 billion.    It was not.    Correct.    Correct.    I believe I do.    I did.  Sorry.    I did.    So methodology here simply refers to the information that we used to assist us in the investigation and the exercises that we conducted to test our own analysis of the work that we undertook.  So we got a range of documents from MNS to assist us with this financial investigation.  Some of them being the best and final offer price letters. The various memoranda that appear – memorandums that were relevant to the business case – the various business cases as well and other reports produced by the Transnet Officials while assessing the transaction with the OEM’s.  We also had to source information of course outside of MNS and Transnet to validate the assumptions to the variables applied within the business case and some of those – well the sides from which you sourced information include the South African Reserve Bank. I mean you have got the US Labour – Bureau for Labour Statistics being another.  The OECD websites and so forth.  Thomson Reuters being a financial depository.  We then had to – not had to, but we then decided to benchmark.  The approach taken to mauling the various components with what would normally be done in the industry to see if – to determine if our approach was actually correct and defendable. We also had to have our work reviewed by an external party.  As is required by the profession.  One of the standards speak to that.  That your work gets reviewed by somebody you deem to have the relevant knowledge, expertise, experience to review your work.  Okay and we also had to conduct – we also approached the market particularly around the foreign currency hedging.  So the Forex curve and we will look at that a little later to determine whether the curve that Transnet applied at the time was what the market will have offered.  So in other words whether Forex Hedging was applied or not.    My work.    Correct.    Well it was signed off.  There were a few changes from the reviewer in the results that I obtained.  None to the input.  None to the methodology, but the results.  Yes.     Correct.     Okay so we were happy with the variables and assumptions used within the business case, there were I suppose minor changes, we would have matched the model but those changes did not invalidate the outcome of the business case, I guess the result would not have been materially different to what was presented to the Board, so we were overall happy with the variables and assumptions.     Correct.     We were happy with the ETC of R38.6 billion.     So we were – given the definition of what ETC is, it’s just a summation of the costs for the various units we were happy that the ETC provided an acceptable price for the acquisition of the locomotives.     Number, ETC, correct it is.     Well there was a need to increase the ETC but not to the tune of R59.9 billion, so the R59.9 billion in its totality was not justifiable.     In our view yes.     Okay so we concluded an 80% increase in ETC, and that is taking into account Transnet Engineering scope, okay would it be more acceptable as opposed to the 41% increase that we see in the memorandum, that 38.6, the 15.9 billion is 41% of the 38.6, okay, so we felt 41% was too large an increase, should we come to the conclusion that Transnet Engineering Scope was irregular and an 11% increase would have been more acceptable.     Correct.     Correct.     Correct.     If I might just quality something?     So in the variables and assumptions, let’s bear in mind that the model did not just look at ETC, it looked at a number of other aspects, one of them being the market demand, in the market demand strategy and that was outside of our scope.  We did however go through the model by ourselves that we understood the mechanics behind the model, so in other words how the MDS, well the market demand was projected over the various years and so forth, so that said given that we did not interrogate the strategy we took the 1064 locomotives as given, as the number of locomotives required, we did not question that.     No.     Correct.     Correct.     Well we would have liked to interrogate the number, however as I mentioned it was beyond our scope, as you mentioned the client knew what they wanted, 1064, so our departure point was 1064.     Okay, the business case essentially the document attached I think it is in Annexure AC2.     And it is the document substantiating the need for this project, so it speaks to the ETC, it speaks to the profit that Transnet would have expected to make at the time, in April 2013, it speaks to the number, both the other benefits outside of 1064 that this project was expected to bring, and I think it speaks to 68 000 new people employed and so forth so there were other strategic benefits that this project was expected to bring, I think nationally, if that is the right word to use. So the business case basically puts a case for this acquisition of 1064 locomotives, it is essentially that.     So I agree with you Chair I think interrogate the business case would mean look at every aspect of the business, in other words starting with the 1064 and determining if 1064 was the number of locomotives required.     Correct.     You are correct so the mandate did not require us to go into but ...(intervenes).       Correct.     Correct, the projections made.     Correct.     Correct.    Okay.  So the financial model is essentially a model based on an excel platform.  Okay it used to – that underpin the business case.  Okay so it is the platform on which the projections were made and the discounting was done.  The costs were modelled.  So it will give you input on – it will give your information on what the MDS volumes were right through to 2014.    No.  No not financed.    But it details how the revenue ...(intervenes).     Would come in.    How the costs would be incurred.    Over the foreseeable lifetime of the project.  In this instance it was about 36 years.      The revenue and the costs.    The projection of those.    And  bring more of those.    No the – so the finance is ...(intervenes).     That is outside of this financial model.    Because the business gets itself off of those not deal in detail with how the project was going to be financed.  In other words what portion – how the debt was going to be acquired?    The financial model is to a large extent the business case.    You cannot.      Correct.    Okay.    I suppose it is easier to speak to it while projecting it.    Okay so Chair what you have on screen is actually is what is termed the financial model.  That is the Excel based workbook.  It has a number of sheets and the sheets are actually represented by the tabs you see at the bottom.  In fact we can actually go through some of them.  You can see the first one there titled Base Case Output.  That is essentially the business case output.    Okay.  Thanks Advocate.  So Base Case Output as you can see there Chair it is the first tab on that – on the workbook.  As the Advocate mentioned there are a number of tabs thereafter.  She has already spoken to this there are 55 of these tabs of which 6 are hidden.  They are hidden because they actually do not feed into the model.  Analysis were done on those sheets but they did not – the output of those – there was no output from those sheets into this business case.  So they are not relevant for purposes of this discussion.  So we are looking at the first tab that which is Base Case Output which is short for business case.    Right.    Well I can hover.    Right.    There we go Chair are you.    Are you able to pick up mouse Chair?  Okay.  So my mouse is there.  That is Base Case Output I have got it right where you have got the tab titled.    Okay.    Where I am on the spreadsheet I can select.    I am not sure if the Chair can follow as I select.    Are you able to follow the     The green ...(intervenes).     The arrow.    I guess this is – any suggestions?    Correct.    Like that?    Alright.      Thank you.      Okay.    I will just try and follow.    It here but still cover what is covered in here.    Okay.  So Base Case Output what you have before you relates to what you would find in your business case document.    What you would find in your business case document.    So in other words AC2 in this instance matches AC2 there.    The actual business case, the document itself.    So what is contained in that document would actually come from this tab that is titled Base Case Output.  And in the statement I have highlighted that I have mentioned what exhibits each of those tables – what exhibits they are within the business case.  If my recollection serves me right I think productivity MGTK is Exhibit 16 on page 29 of the business case.      I did not get the question Advocate.    Correct.    Okay.  So that is the first table we have there on the screen and I will highlight the whole table for the Chair in yellow.    Correct.    Okay.  So now this table as mentioned it is on page 29 of the exhibits and it is Exhibit 16 on page 29 of the business case which is the document.  It moulds the ...(intervenes).     Sorry.    You do not need to it is just ...(intervenes).     Assisting you in terms of identifying where it is within the document.    And assuring you that the financial model actually speaks to the business case.    Unpins the business case.  This table models the volumes that would be transported each year by the locomotives and what would be required – in fact what would be left off.  So I will go line by line.  As you can see there the first row there I will highlight that in red.   Is the Chair still with us?  And it speaks to the required capacity as per the market demand strategy.  So I will highlight that.    Correct.    And you – we can see here it is projected from 2013 to 22 so I am still on that row.  In first year starting off at 86 million gross ton. So gross ton in this instance relates to the weight including the wagon itself, the weight of the wagon.  So we talk of gross ton and we talk of nett tons.  Nett ton is just the weight of the contents.  What the wagon is transporting.  So essentially you have your MDS in the first row there.  If you are following cursor all the way.  This table shows it only up to 2022 but goes as far as 2051 if we look at the source of this information.  The  ambius volumes are actually modelled under volume MDS.  So as not to lose you Chair I am – I have gone back to Base Case Output and as you follow my cursor I am moving to the right under the different tabs and I am on volume MDS Output.  So that sheet titled Volume MDS Output models or projects what the market demand would be for the various commodities.  You got commodities such as petroleum.  You got manganese.  You got chrome, iron ore.  So everything that Transnet would – can expect to transport is modelled there and the total of that is what you see there is MDS Required Volume in each of the various years.  So 2013 you have got 86 – apologies Sir 86 million gross tons in 2013.  98 and so forth.  So it is the total across all commodities that Transnet can expect to transport over the year including the weight of the wagon hence million gross ton.  So it is a million.  The line following that – so this is how the number of 1064 was arrived at.  We have got existing fleet capacity I will then highlight in red again.  If the Chair has picked it up?  Okay.  Alright.  So that is existing fleet capacity.  In other words what the existing fleet at the time is able to absorb from the market demand.  And we see there from 86 million gross ton kilometres the existing fleet can only transport 79 million of that.  And that tells you because they cannot absorb the entire market demand or they cannot service the entire market they are still in need to acquire additional locomotives.  I will skip written off.  Written off is essentially what you lose from locomotives being written off these locomotives had a life span of about 30 years with modifications and additional work on them they could be extended to about 45 years.  However in each year there was a wreckage. So from that wreckage you would have lost in 2013 1.1 million from locomotives not being operational being written off.  In total the required capacity in fact what was not – what would not have been transported in 2013 is about 8 million in 2013.  I will just highlight the row I am referring to.  That is the red row there.  Okay.  So about 8 million gross ton kilometres will not be transported in 2013 and so forth.  So as mentioned this was projected right up 2051 to be able to arrive at a number for the locomotives required and model the revenue.  We will look at that a bit later.  So that is the first table.  I am not sure if there are any questions from the Chair?  Okay.    Left over correct.    Not – shortfall – not transported.    Yes.    Correct.    By acquiring locomotives.    But as mentioned earlier – sorry.    As mentioned earlier we would not – it was out of our – outside of our mandate to actually interrogate that MDS required.    Capacity yes.    As fact yes.    I missed that Advocate.    I missed that.    7 correct yes.    Correct Advocate.    Okay.  So I must say the structure of this followed the exhibits within the business case you trying to identify those exhibits in this case.  So I will explain what the – that table is.  I will start again Chair I will just go back to the top. So to get to that table titled New General Freight Business Diesel Locomotive Plan I have to scroll down the sheet.  Okay.  And I think – let me just highlight that for Chair’s attention.  It is highlighted in yellow Chair.  So that is the table that you see there.    And okay I cannot pick up the Exhibit number for this table in the business case.  I will speak to it.    Okay.  So this table refers to the number of diesel locomotives out of the 1064 that would be acquired in over what period they would be acquired.  And you would have seen this in the business case in the statement.  Essentially it tells us that 100 locomotives as per the business case would have been acquired by March 2014.  Because we know this business case started in April 2013 with 8 locomotives being acquired each month.  Okay.  To be exact it is 8.33 for modelling purposes.  So 100 were expected within the first year.  The next 100 were expected within the year to follow which is 2015 and so forth.  In the final year which is March 2018, 65 diesel locomotives were expected totalling 465 over the delivery period. So this just explains the delivery period – delivery schedule of the diesel locomotives.      It was 7 years.    From 2013 to the end of 2019,    So if I can just for complete – sorry I think just to complete the discussion the table just beneath that relates to the electric locomotives.  This can be seen 65 as of March 2015, 130 thereafter and 144 in – by March 2019 expected.  So a total of 599 electric locomotives the sum of the two gives you the 1064 locomotives.    No it is ...(intervenes).     It is 65.  In which year sorry 20 – March – by March 2015 65 locomotives, electric locomotives would have been acquired.    So that is the delivery schedule essentially.  The combination of the diesel and the electric is what is termed the delivery schedule in the business case.    Correct.    Correct.    In the statement I speak about Supplier Production Capacity.  And I will just scroll down Chair to the relevant table.  Okay it is actually the table following the electric locomotives table and I will highlight in yellow.  So that table Chair tells us how many locomotives would be delivered each month in the respective categories in this instance diesel and electric.  As I mentioned earlier 8 diesels were projected to be delivered each month over the delivery schedule and for electric you had 5 in the first year moving up 11 and then 12 in the final year.  So these are the monthly deliveries expected.  So I am just as I mentioned earlier explaining the Exhibits within the business case.    So ...(intervenes).     On a monthly basis correct.    What the supplier is able to provide on a monthly basis yes.    Correct so 8 for diesels and right through the delivery period and for electrics starting off at 5 into 11 and then ending off at 12.    Correct.    It is.  I think we can see there that you have got a 7 year period roughly if you – because electric locomotives were to start in 14 and diesels in 2013.  I think if you overlap the two you get roughly 7 years.  So it is between 6 and 5 years.  I mean 6 and 7 years sorry.    Changes in?    Well that would be a function of the number of suppliers that you have.    This tells us the supplier is expected to provide you with 8 a month.  He does not tell us whether that is the maximum they can provide in that month.  If you have two suppliers per diesel you can easily double that to 16 a month.    Okay so that is ...(intervenes).     Correct.    That is Exhibit 15 in the business case.    At least that has been highlighted in ...(indistinct).  And I will highlight the table for the attention of the Chair.     Correct.    Correct.  So essentially right up to and if the Chair is following everything in yellow relates to electric locomotive stock at the time.  So this is April 2013.  So the number of electric locomotives ...(intervenes).     That Transnet had ...(intervenes).     And that is a total of about 1037.  So summing up that column there – C – sorry.  Let me just highlight that in red.  So what you have in yellow relates to the electric locomotives that Transnet had within it is – I guess it is stock.  Okay.  As at April 2013 and what you have in red are the numbers per type of locomotive. So 6E they had 75 of those and right down to the bottom 18E, they had 597 of those.  The total of that is 1037.  Everything thereafter following are the diesel locomotives.  The total was 1889 locomotives.    Correct.    Okay.    Again we speak to this, because it is in the business case.  I just highlight that for the Chair’s attention.  So this is basically on the tariff – the Rand tariff that Transnet would charge to transport a million tons of whatever commodity they are transporting per kilometre and we can see in 2013 they were looking at 40 cents – 42 cents. Sorry and that went up to 45 cents – 48.  This actually goes up to about R3,80 or so when you look at the full table in the sheets to follow, but it is essential because it tells it is an essential component into the revenue that could be expected from the locomotives.  The Rand per gross ton per kilometre and that is what we see there.    Correct.  So now we are looking at net tons.  I will highlight that again for the Chair’s attention.    Also in the business case.  In Annexure AC2.  Now to explain this table again as I mentioned.  This tells us whether 1064 locomotives came from.  You got the MDS target.  Now here we are looking at net tons.  This is excluding the weight of the wagon itself and we can see from the market demand strategy about 91 million tons were required in 2013. That was the demand from the market and the existing fleet could only transport 83 million of those tons and given how the locomotives were to be acquired.  We can see there is a shortfall of about – I guess – 8 million there.  Okay.  If we look at 91 and 83.  The short fall is 8 million. Okay, but the Board decided and if you look at the full contingence of locomotives required it was about 1300-odd, but they decided instead of acquiring 1300.  We will acquire 1064.  Given that these locomotives were spread out over the same period and were expecting only 100 diesel locomotives.  The additional capacity or tonnage that they could transport was 1 million.    As can be seen there.  So I will just highlight that for the Chair’s attention.  Okay.  So from the 1064 locomotives project only a million of that shortfall of eight would be catered by the 1064.  In 2014 this goes up to seven, but there is still a shortfall as can be seen if you look at 104 versus 82 and that goes up to 21 and up to 77.  That is locomotives would be able to transport. So the 1000 locomotives did not absorb the entire – did not allow for the entire MDS to be met.  I think there was still a shortfall even though with 1064 locomotives on board and that a decision taken by the board.  I guess being prudent that the – maybe they were just a little bit too optimistic.  For a number – there may have been reasons that we – there are reasons, but we are not aware of those reasons.    Correct.   Okay. This was following the business case ...(intervenes).     But making this relevant to the discussion – looking at what the 1064 locomotives could transport.  We can see the projection is there being one in year.  I have highlighted that in red for your attention Chair.  So we have the volumes.  The net tons that the locomotives could transport.  (Indistinct) transport one in the first year.  Seven in the second year 21 and so forth up to 77. These volumes multiplied by the rate and the distance gives you the revenue, but I guess we will address that a bit later, but that is the relevance of this table.  To help you understand how the volumes fit into the revenue computation.  The revenue computation is actually a function of your volumes to be transported.  The distance over which those volumes will be transported and the Rand tariff per ton per kilometre.    Correct.    I suppose because we will elaborate on them later on.    They deal with Net Present Value and the various costs.  If you wish Advocate we can actually tough on that.    Okay.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.  Okay.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Okay.    Alright Chair.    Alright.  So I guess we are looking at the review of the business case in this instance ...(intervenes).     And we are tackling specifically the revenue and the cost components.  The idea behind this is to give you Chair an understanding of what this business case is.  About how they arrived at that in that Present Value figure.  So the components.  I guess the sub variables or the line items that make up cost and the line items that make up revenue. We have to a certain extent spoken about the line items that make up revenue and there is essentially three, but we will get to that again shortly.  Just for completion  ...(intervenes).     Oh.  Okay.    Correct.    Correct Advocate.    Correct.    Okay.  We just trying to tie this in with the statement I suppose.    So in our assessment of the model we found it to serve several purposes and some of which to be assessing the profitability of the project and this is in Net Present Value terms.  So this financial model help Transnet officials to arrive at what they expected the profit to be.  What expected profit – they arrived at an expected profit figure. Sorry.  Okay.  To determine what the total – the Estimated Total Cost of the locomotives would be.  Okay and I will speak to that.  It is a component of the total cost of the project.    If that works.    Will see from there.  Okay.  Alright.  So the model served several purposes from our assessment of ...(intervenes).     Okay.    Okay.  Okay.  It served several purposes.  Some of which were to determine what the profit would be – the expected profit at the time.  Determine what the Total Cost of Ownership of which ETC formed a part of and we will look at that shortly and to better appreciate the risks of the project and that comes through in the form of sensitivities being run on some of the variables and the assumptions.  I think we will touch on that as we look at some of the tabs.    Okay.    Okay.    Alright.  So those are the purposes that we felt were relevant for the – for this statement.  Well that we felt were important to discuss all in this statement and in assessing the profitability, the ETC and assessing the risk two key measures were applied in the business case.  Net Present Value.  We spoke to that. It is essentially the difference between the value in current terms of the revenue you expect and the value in current terms of the cost you expect to incur.  It is just the difference giving you a profit figure at the bottom.  ETC.  We have spoken to that.  It is just the sum of the cost of the locomotives in each of the years.  We looked at the schedule. I must get myself to slowdown and we had 100 locomotives in  – as at March 2014.  So it is simply the cost of those 100 locomotives plus the cost of the next 100 and so forth.  Right up to 18.  Similarly for electrics and that sum gives you the ECT.  It is a simple summation of costs of acquiring those locomotives.  I also mentioned earlier those costs included - it was not just the locomotive price. We had escalation costs in there.  A locomotive today at price X will cost you something else in a year’s time.  So you had to account for inflation in there.  Exchange would impact as well.  You had to account for that within the cost and you also had contingencies.  I guess we will look at the diesel a bit later.    Correct.    Okay.  So we have looked three sub variables or should I say line items making up revenue in this instance.  We looked at the distance to be travelled each year by each locomotive.  The volumes to be transported by each locomotive.  We also looked at the Rand tariff per locomotive.  I mean per million ton per kilometre. Your revenue is essentially the product of that.  You take what you expect to transport in that particular year.  Multiply it by the distance and multiply it by the Rand tariff and that is done right through to 2049.  It was 36-year projection period for this project where revenue is concerned.  I think just to speak a bit about the escalation in the Rand tariffs. This started off at 42 cents.  We saw that up to 48.  The average escalation rate of that Rand tariff.  So each year it was – the Rand tariff was escalated just to keep in line with inflation.  On average it was about 6.12% over the 36-year period.  A lot – a little higher over the initial period I think ranging between 6 and 8%, but then stabilising about 6%.  Okay.  Which is a reasonable assumption to make when you project a revenue.    Correct.    It is what I read in the financial model.    I think just to touch a bit on the incremental volumes and this – that incremental volumes are just volumes expected from 1064.  We already saw starting off at one up to 77.  It actually peaked at 89 and that is when you had your entire fleet of 1064 locomotives.  Okay.  With 1064 locomotives you were expected to transport about 89 million tons of commodities.  It then tapers off at the end as your locomotives are written off, because these locomotives have a 30-year lifespan. I guess.    The distance was on average about 550 kilometres a year and that is derived from historical figures what has been observed from the existing locomotive fleet.    The cost.  Okay.  So under cost Chair we had a number of variables and you can see them overhead on the slide.  The first one being TCO.  The Total Cost of Ownership of which ETC form the part of.  You also had wagon costs, because the locomotive also refers to the head – the engine of the train.  You had infrastructure costs. This is essentially what you had to lay out to operationalise the trains and then you had overhead costs.  So the certain costs as a business that occur that are fixed regardless of the volume of business that you take on and that was derived from the financial statements and your tax costs. So these are the cost items actually modelled as part of this project.  Now moving into the Total Cost of Ownership.  We mentioned NTCO.  We had the capital acquisition cost of the locomotive.  That was the ETC.  In addition to ETC and this is still part of Total Cost of Ownership.  You had the fuel costs.  You had the personnel costs. You had insurance costs.  You had emission costs both diesel and electric locomotives.  So you had the same across diesels and across electrics.  So those various costs and I am just trying to locate myself.    Correct.    Or slide 6?    So Chair as you can see from the slide.  The slide speaks to what the net – the expected Present Value was at the time – the Net Present Value and the value of R2.7 billion was expected at the time from this project.    Correct.  We can  ...(intervenes).     Yes.    We can add up that analogy.  Yes.    Okay.  So I will just refer to it as the profit expected as at April 2013 and that came to about R2.7 billion.  I will take you through the various cost items just to give an idea of how the 2.7 was …(indistinct).  If you look at the revenue component in that slide – on that slide.  Sorry.  Revenue made up 109 billion. So over that projection period, that 36-year period, the value of the revenue expected as at April 2013 was R109 billion.  I think when you look at the profit of 2.7 as a percentage of that.  You are looking at about 2.5% profit.  So that tells us that the costs were quite high as well.  If you look at the diesel TCO that is the Total Cost of Ownership attributable to diesel locomotives and that TCO includes ETC and if I recall right the ETC component was only 8 billion of that 22 billion that we see there. So diesel TCO was about 22 billion in Present Value terms.  Electric TCO was about 21 – also in the region of 22 billion.  However the ETC relating to electrical was slightly higher at about four billion.  I think we will look at that diesel a bit later.  Wagon costs ...(intervenes).     You are referring to TCO in this instance?    So to own and to operate.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    As mentioned in this point with diesel we only dealt with the locomotive.  Wagons were required.  I think there was a total of about 16500 wagons required to operationalise the 1064 locomotives and those came in at a cost in Present Value terms of about 12 billion.    There were infrastructure costs as well and I would resume these would relate to the railing, the electrics and so forth.  Those came in at about 19 – oh sorry.  18 – R18.5 billion and your overhead costs is about R24 billion.  Tax at about R7.7 billion.  Giving us a profit position of about 2.7 billion.  So despite a large revenue figure expected. We also had large costs associated with the project.  Hence the statement that ETC made up a very tiny component of the costs of this project back when we look at the figures.  It was only about 47% of the TCO costs and only about 20% of the overall costs.    The business case derives that.  Yes.    Okay.      The risk discount rate.  Correct.    Okay.  We spoke about valuing cash flows in Present Value terms.  The Present Value of the revenue.  The Present Value of the costs.  Present Value simply means bringing back the cost by a certain factor – a certain discount rate.  I think to put it very simply and maybe I will come back to this.  If you expect to invest R100 and get 10 in the first year, 10 in the second year and 110 in the third year. You are looking at a discount for about 10% to get you back to 100.  I think when we get to IR.  I will explain how that 10% relates to IR as well.  Now Transnet has what we call or what they call – sorry – a Work and Hurdle Rate Policy and that policy determines what the hurdle rate should be for two types of projects.  Greenfields Projects and Brownfields Projects. Greenfields Projects are projects that Transnet has never undertaken before and as you will expect the discount rate, the hurdle rate, needs to …(indistinct) for this point for now, will be higher for a Greenfield Project compared to a Brownfields Project.  I think if we take a simple analogy of a site with nothing but grass.  There is a lot more work to done to get that site to be operational to service purpose. A Brownfields Project at least you have got brown bricks.  So you have got somewhere to start off from.  The risk is a lot lower, because you are starting your project at a different stage.  So the construction stage is off the table.  At the time Transnet’s policy on the hurdle rate was 18.56% for Greenfields Project and I think Brownfields – I cannot remember. Probably about 2% lower, but that needs to be verified.  Now what is a hurdle rate?  A hurdle rate is a rate of return that the organisation wants to make on any Greenfields Project that it will invest in.  In other words it will look at the return expected from a project and if that return does not meet the hurdle rate they are not interested.  They will simply put aside. To arrive at that rate you look at a range of factors, your capital providers, in other words how much of your project is being financed by debt and what is the cost of that debt.  In this case arriving at that rate the cost is about 7.31% so that is the weight of the various debt structures that Transnet would have had to employ.   The capital coming through, what return do we want on that capital, it was about 16.58% okay.  So it will cost you an average of about 12% if you combine the seven and the 16 for the capital to embark on this project.  So your real weight has got to be at least that cost of capital. In this instance given that we’re dealing with the Greenfields project, one that Transnet has never undertaken before and has no experience in undertaking a rate of 18.56 was applied which is quite a high rate considering the 12 that we’re looking at, that’s a 6% margin addition to the cost of capital in this instance. Now that is just a target rate, in other words we’ve got six Greenfields projects, we’re only going to be undertaking three because only three give us a return of at least 18.56% that’s how you use the hurdle rate.  To be able to make that decision you’ve got to compute what’s called an internal rate of return, that’s simply the return that you expect from the project.  Going to my initial example of a hundred that’s a typical government bond for example, I mean – in this instance, I mean you put in a 100 you expect 10 as a coupon in the first year another 10 the second year, that’s an example of a – and another 100 and 10 at the final stages, that’s your capital plus your 10% interest. The IRR or Internal Rate of Return in this instance is 10%, it is that % that you will compare your hurdle rate.  So you might say, well I want to invest a 100 I’m going to borrow the 100 but how much does it cost me to borrow the 100, it costs me 8%.   I would set my hurdle rate at 9%, if my investment does not give me at least 9% I’m not interested.  In this instance my IRR from this investment is 10, so it meets my investment criteria, my hurdle rate of nine.  So I will invest the 100 that I borrowed into this project, make my 10% and pay off the 9%, so that’s hurdle rate and IRR. Now the risk inherent in this investment of a 100, 10, 10, 10, 0 and 10 is a different risk altogether.  You’ve got to undergo a detailed risk assessment to understand what that risk discount ratio should be.  So looking at government bonds and the profile I’ve just given you and equities, you might expect the same cash-flow screen from a government bond and equities however I think we can both agree that the risk profile is totally different between equities and government bonds.   So the risk discount rate that you would apply on this stream of cash-flow is different to the risk discount rate from this stream of cash-flow from equities and that requires you to undergo a detailed risk assessment of both investments together with the risk discount rate.  In this instance Transnet chose to apply the hurdle rate as it’s risk discount rate.  I guess later on we will speak about our view on that rate, we’re happy with it, given the process that they underwent to arrive at that 18.56% it was evidenced based looking at companies locally and abroad you’re looking at about 160 companies to arrive at a premium over the weighted average cost of capital which is what your shareholders will have.   Average of the cost of your shareholder capital and your debt holder capital cost.  We were happy with the 18.56% but essentially that is what the 18.56% is, it is Transnet’s hurdle rate which is also their risk discount rate for this project.     Is it coincidental?     Well I’d like to believe that a detailed risk assessment was done, my understanding is that the 18.56 was actually derived from this 1064 project.     So it’s slightly off that project to arrive at the hurdle rate.     Well there is a policy to that effect, the Wacc and Hurdle Rate Policy.     For the various projects it will be Brownfields or Greenfields.     No.      We were happy with the approach taken involving the costs, we had certain views I suppose along the way, the tax asset was treated and by tax asset in this case I mean if you have a loss in one year you can carry it over and I think the taxation rues at this point allow you to carry it over for five years, in the model it was done for one year which is a very conservative approach, in other words we were deciding not to carry this thing for five years but for one year and that has an effect of reducing your present value.  So we were – we accepted that approach.     Well had the ...(indistinct) of five years it would have increased the NPV.        Yes.     This is a more conservative approach yes than, I guess, it’s more pessimistic.     A higher profit yes.     We are happy to accept that.     Correct.     Correct.     Okay I think it is a – I should address this slide I suppose.     So Chair this slide, essentially is a sensitivity test on the discount rate and its impact on the net present value, we spoke about the weight of average cost of capital in other words the average of what shareholders would cost for the capital and what your debt holders will cost for they want to provide you as capital, the average of that.  For this case it was 12.56% okay and that’s towards the end.   Starting off at the far end of the slide 12.6% - at 12.6% – if 12.6% was used as the risk discount rate this would have produced a profit in that present value of R34.1 billion you drop that by 1% – I mean you increase that by 1% so move up from 12.6 to 13.6 your profit drops to 26.2.  Now this is indicative of an increase of the level of risk if you increase your risk discount rates, it’s synonymous with you assuming that the risk of the project has increased.  So I want to discount my cash-flow by a higher rate and that has the effect of lowering your profit. The objective of this slide is to show you how exponential this profit – the distribution of this profit is and if you look at that, it drops exponentially so – and I think in the statement I do mention, I can just get back to those specific numbers, I can’t find it but essentially the difference between 2.7 and 5.9 I think is about – well R3.2 billion if you look at the next difference between 5.9 and 9.7 I think you’re looking at about roughly 4.   So that difference increases with a drop in the discount rate so exponentially the difference keeps increasing and upward sloping, profit position there as you drop the discount rate by 1%.     Correct.     Yes and that is essentially internal rate of return.     Correct, so just a 1% increase in that risk discount rate would have wiped out your profit of R2.7 billion in this instance.     Okay so the risk discount rate would drop with a decrease in risk yes, that’s what you would expect to see.     Correct.     Yes.     Sorry?     Correct and that impact increases as you drop the discount rate.     Yes.     Correct.     I point that out because there seemed to have been an over emphasis on ETC at the expense of the profitability of the project.     Besides starting with the mandate that we should check the ETC and having looked deeper into the business case we realised actually the ETC only makes up 20% of the cost, the project is a lot bigger than this ETC that we are referring to, the memorandum, I think a bit later, as we all – well we’ll come to it.     The 23 May 2014 memorandum speaking of the increase in ETC and that is the headline on that memorandum the Board might have wanted to look beyond the ETC and get the profitability of the project and that seems to have been addressed in one or two paragraphs whereas ETC made up the remaining 80 odd paragraphs.     Correct.     Correct.     In justifying the ETC.     The increase in the ETC yes.     Correct.     I do.     So we have discussed this.     Correct, I think the one part we had not discussed the 6.83 which is the view on the assumptions made to the variables.     So looking at that, 6.8.1 has been dealt with which is the – relates to the revenue costs.     In the business case the net present value of R2.7 billion has been addressed.     The reasonability of the assumptions in relation to ETC has not yet been addressed.     Okay.      We have.      Shouldn’t we?     Okay.     Correct.     So Chair starting off on paragraph 7.6 this looks at the total cost of ownership and we have dealt with this in some detail highlighting what the costs were but we did not speak specifically to the ETC component although we did allude to it earlier on and the ETC in this instance looked at the capital of acquiring the – or the cost of acquiring the locomotives, so the price per locomotive, there was a 2% localisation premium in the business case added to the price to allow for the likelihood of the locomotive manufacture, locally being higher than that abroad.   I think reasonably so, so ETC was the price the localisation premium also included inflation, so escalation in the price over the various years also included – and that’s escalation or inflation locally and abroad because a part of these locomotives were to be manufactured there was a foreign component to it and there was a local component to the locomotive so different inflation or escalation rates would apply on these locomotives.  We also had a foreign currency risk hedging cost, a Forex cost and we had contingencies, so those are the elements that made up ETC in this business case and as mentioned ETC made up – formed the part of total cost of ownership. Now how was ETC, and I’m not sure if we should actually address this now how the ETC was modelled or much later, I can go through the modelling process quickly or shall I say the deviation of 3.6 or lave that for later?     For later okay thank you.  So just to give you a brief explanation of – starting off with diesels, so the price assumed for diesel locomotives in the 2013 business case was 2.6 million Dollars and 3.5 for electrics, 50% of that 2.6 million was to be borne locally, so that’s 1.3 million Dollars okay, so 1.3 million Dollars worth of locomotive if I can use that term was to be manufactured in South Africa, 1.3 million Dollars worth of locomotive was to be manufactured overseas, in this instance looking at the US given that we’re dealing with the US Dollar price.   The foreign component of the locomotive, the 1.3 million Dollars, would be escalated as you would expect by foreign escalation, using foreign escalation rates and what was assumed in this instance was about 2.3% a year escalation.  The local component of the 1.3 million Dollars would be escalated because that is in rands using local inflation indices or rates, that’s a better term to use and there we I think the  ...(indistinct) was between 5.3 and 5.7% over the period or 5.9% okay.  So we can see that the inflation rates are materially different in this instance, the economies are different, they’re subject to different economic conditions so you can expect those changes in prices to differ between the two economies. So to arrive at a price for the diesel locomotive in year one with the model assuming the 2.6 million Dollar price did not escalate that in that year, however used for the foreign component because that had to be hedged and we’ll demonstrate that there was hedging in a short while, the forward rate for the Dollar in a year, and I think at that point it must have been 9.582 or something to that effect.  So the foreign component of course to convert that amount to Rand terms had to be multiplied by 9.5 rands to the Dollar to arrive at a Rand price to arrive at that foreign component and ...(intervenes).      That was the exchange rate applied at the time.     And the rest of course, was just – to the local component of course you had to add the 2% premium to that, the sum of those factors I gave you, the Rand price in that year, I think it was about R25.2 million, let me just check that.     Correct, okay yes to that gave us a total of R25.2 million rands per locomotive – diesel locomotive in 2013 ...(intervenes).      9.58 odd.     The same process was followed for the years to follow, however the Rand component was escalated at the local rate of inflation, the foreign component at the foreign rate of inflation and whatever that amounted – so in year two you would take the 1.6 million Dollars, escalate it by 2.3% and then that figure is then what you then hedge, multiply at the forward rate in year two.  The combination of that gives you a price and that price was R26.7 million in 2014.     Per locomotive.     No, no so this already includes the hedging cost.     The 26 – it’s a Rand amount and it’s a combination of the local component in Rand terms and the foreign component in Rand terms allowing for the 2% localisation premium.     Correct.     Well it’s going to tell you what the ETC is.     Correct.     Correct.     Correct so.     Oh that’s the business case, the financial model all of these derives from the business model.     Correct.     Correct.     Correct, applying these rates allowing for inflation and all the other variables.     Paragraph 19?     Those are still the costs making up TCO, Total Cost of Ownership.     Correct.     We have.     Well I think it is important to mention one thing Advocate, the maintenance costs.     We’ve got two different tables, two different Forex rates within the business plan.     Now we found it important to speak about the various exchange rates found in the business case because the mandate will tell us that hedging is included in 30.6, hedging costs I included in the 30.6 billion or not.  We came across hedged forward curves for foreign currency hedging we also came across forecasts and those forecasts are what we have under the maintenance costs and we have them specifically under maintenance costs because forecasts – forecasted rates are only applied in projecting maintenance costs and that is the only instance where we saw forecasted rates being applied in the business case.   Everywhere else it was the forward curve.     We have.     Correct, so a lot of these costs were escalated, well the ETC the locomotive price – the local component of the locomotive prices was escalated using SA Producer Price Indices, it is undoubtedly the right index to use given that you look at manufacturing goods, the locomotives in the same sense, not CPI but PPI.     We’re happy with the fact that the variable itself was PPI, it’s the appropriate index to use.  The assumptions used in the business case at the time was around 6% going forward and I think 5.7 to 5.9 in the initial period, we were also happy with those assumptions I think largely considering what it had been in the past and looking at the five-year period preceding it was about 3.6% and the 10-year preceding it was about 5.6%.  We felt that the assumptions made in the business case were pretty much in line with what he had observed historically and where it was likely to go.     That’s US now.     So we’re still speaking about SA.     Alright Chair on the foreign currency and I think we’ll still get to that – discuss that a bit later but we simply state that those rates were forward curve rates, so hedging costs were allowed for and we’ll unpack that later but earlier we spoke about the 6% margin over the weighted average cost of capital, it’s quite a high margin especially considering that the cost of equity used to arrive at the weight was about 16% so you’re looking at an additional 2% over the cost of equity for this type of project, it’s a high risk project given that Transnet had never undertaken this type of project before 80.56% was considered acceptable also considering that it was evidence based looking at a number of companies,  not just locally but abroad about 160.     About 160.     That’s what they researched so we considered that 80.56% as a reasonable discount rate to use in discounting the cash flows.  On the US side we had a – it was a bit concerning that the financial model applied CPI as opposed to PPI because we thought, okay these are locomotives okay they’re not consumer goods they are producer goods they will be affected by producer price changes rather than consumer price changes.   We then looked at the correlation between CIP in the United States and PPI and the correlation, as you can see there is was very, very high and positive for that matter, I mean CPI and PPI in the US they pretty much track each other as can be seen from the graph.  We also find that for the most part US CPI led US CPI except above US PPI, it was slightly higher and I think when you look at the average going back it was about 3.6 compared to 3.3.  3.6 being that of the United States and 3.3 being that of – sorry being that of CPI and 3.3 being that of PPI.   So we’re happy with US CPI because, again that implied a certain level of conservation I suppose, being a little pessimistic around the price of locomotives going forward.  So at least the incentive was not to push this project through when you look at the business case but to be very conservative when presenting to the Board and saying, listen it’s R3.7 billion and we have, where we could apply margins to our assumptions to allow for any additional risk that might have crept in that could creep in if we did not allow for, either in our insurance or in the risk discount rate.     Oh yes correct, so this was sourced from I think this day’s trading economics but there’s ...(intervenes).      This is market data.     Correct.     It served to increase it slightly.     Yes.     US PPI wouldn’t expect to come any lower than 38.4 billion.     Well I won’t say they used the wrong index but they’re probably trying to be more prudent and conservative, we’re happy with the 38.6 as an ETC.     And foreign yes that’s right.     Well I think – there’s another slide that we looked at another sensitivity that we ran and this speaks to – I mentioned this, I’m not sure if I did but local content as well was a variable in this instance it varied from diesel to electric, we look at the detailed requirements that are – the business case speaks to the 60/40 for electrics and the 55/45 for diesel, 60% required local content on the electrics and 55% local content required on the diesel and – however, the business case modelled this ETC on a 50/50 on an assumption of 50 locally and 50% abroad, we tried to assess the impact of this and we found the impact to be negligible here as well.   I think if you move away from a 50% local content and you assume a 60% local content the impact in the price is a drop in the ETC as can be seen.  It’s pretty much the same 38.6 billion compared to 38.555 billion.     So it’s a, in our view, a negligible difference, negligible in the sense that it will not ...(intervenes).      Sorry?     So moving to 60 would have actually reduced the ETC and increased the net present value as can be seen from 2.739 to 2.75 billion and that’s what an impact of an increase or a change in that assumption would have done to this business case.     So I suppose in conclusion we were happy with the mechanics of the model in other words how the model actually modelled, projected and discounted the cash flows.  We’re happy with the variables employed within the model, the assumptions made around those variables of course within the context of our mandate one variable being the number of locomotives which we did not interrogate we took as is.  We were also happy with 38.6 billion ETC and I’m not sure if this is the point where we answer if it includes all the other – but I ...(intervenes).      No, we’re not at that stage.    Okay.  So the second part of the mandate entailed assessing whether the 38.6 billion was a reasonable cost for the locomotive.  I think we spoke briefly about that.      And whether that included Forex Hedging and escalation.    The finding in that regard was the 38.6 billion was a reliable estimate for the locomotive – for the 1064 locomotives and the ETC did indeed include Forex Hedging and escalation.    Ja.    Okay.    Correct.    Okay.  So if I may Chair?  So I have got overhead slide 12.    Which details the delivery schedule.  We have spoken to this already.  Again just quickly going through it was 100 right through to 2017 for diesel locomotives in each year and 65 locomotives in the year 2018 and that is ending in March 2018.  And we can see the electrics being shifted out one year starting in April 2014 and ending March 2015 we were expecting 65 electric locomotives.  130 right through to 2018 and 144 locomotives in the last year – the year ending March 2019.    And that is a total of 1064 locomotives.  What I point beneath point to underneath that table is the four month testing period.  So one thing I omitted to mention earlier on was that 90% of the price was paid on delivery for the locomotive.  That is how the business schedule is developed with the remaining 10% paid four months later after testing.  The revenue as well followed that philosophy.  You can only generate revenue once the locomotives are operational so your revenue only kicked in four months after delivery of the first locomotive.  The business case also allows for that delay in time.  A four month delay.    Correct.    It accounted for the delay.    In the operation of the locomotives.  The four month delay period was one of the aspects we also engaged with – engaged on – with Transnet Officials.  Whether four months was a reasonable period for testing their view was based on practice it was around nine months.  It will take about nine months to – from delivery to getting the locomotives to start operating.  Basically nine months to test.  What the four month delay did in the business case was to bring the costs forward a bit and again that has the – and well has the impact of reducing your profit.  Because you incurring costs a lot sooner than you would have initially anticipated or expected if you had used the nine month lead period.  So we were happy with the four month delay – again it was conservative.    Okay.  So slide 13.    Is presented – projected overhead.  So we break down the 38.6 billion into the various components that we spoke to earlier on except for the localisation premium.  The localisation premium we have allowed for in the locomotive price.  We then – we will look at SA PPI and what proportion – what amount that formed in the 38.6 billion.  We will look at US PPI and what amount that formed in the 38.6 billion.  The foreign currency cost as well we will look at that and what amount it formed in the 38.6 billion and the contingency amount.  Essentially all of that made up your 38.6 billion we discussed it.  We then divide – we divided those costs by locomotive type as well.  We looking at diesels and looking at electric locomotives.      Correct.  In the form presenting that amount.    Correct.    So would it be from the financial model.    And from certain sheets in the financials – certain worksheets in the financial model.    I can speak to the sheet?    Correct we look at annexure AC4.    Oh.  Apologies for that.    Correct.    Apologies Chair.    It is titled TCO Locos CAPAX.    I have 163 here.    Oh we can ignore that yes.    We can ignore that.    Page 163 and in particular the table.    To the left of the graph yes.    Yes.    Okay.      Correct.    Correct.    Okay.    Correct.    In part.    Yes.    Okay so there are a number of worksheets we would need to work through in order to demonstrate what we have in slide 13.  The second worksheet we would need to work through is the third worksheet titled Main Control Input.      Is the Chair able to see?  Okay.  Chair if I can point you to the red cells.    And the third one in particular.  If you can see where my cursor is it shows you 38.6 billion.  If that is ...(intervenes).     That is our ETC,    Okay.  That is per the business case.  Just beneath that cell you can see the nett present value of 2.7 billion.    Again trying to substantiate the view that the business case was actually derived from this ...(indistinct).  What we will attempt to do in this instance is to look at the inflation assumptions made locally and abroad.  Look at the assumptions made around foreign exchange – the foreign exchange rate going forward and adjust those and determine what – and well basically observe the impact it has on the 38.6 billion.  Hopefully that will suffice as proof that the 38.6 billion allowed for both costs.  But I guess before we get there as well it would be ideal to look at what the locomotives would have cost Transnet had they decided to acquire them as at April 2013.  Going back to your initial suggestion and discussion around ETC about acquiring them right there and not spreading over the delivery period.  I think once we have verified that it would become clear that this is what the locomotives will have cost you barring all the additional costs.    So Chair I will go back to the annexure before you which is TCO Locos CAPAX.      AC4.    Yes.  And I will attempt to explain what you have before you.    So Chair the first table which is the top part as you can see there and I maybe I should highlight all of that.      That table is what we are looking at.  Relates to the projection of the diesel locomotive prices right through to 2022.  We know however that the delivery schedule ended in 2019.  Following the cursor – maybe I should use the mouse instead.  That is the financial year in red as can be seen.  Second row says Diesel.  ZAR locomotive essentially is the price of the locomotive in Rand terms.  And we can see starting April 2013 the price of the locomotive in Rands was R25.2 million.  We can that price – that is the next cell is the yellow cell is held constant right through the year.  So up to March 2014.  It is important to understand how this price – how this – how we arrive at his 25.2.  You will recall Chair the price of the diesel locomotive that we had started off with was 2.6 million Dollars.  I attempted to explain how we move from 2.6 million Dollars to 25.2 million Rands.  The assumption made was 50% of the locomotive content would be sourced locally and 50% would be sourced abroad.  And that is 1.3 million Dollars locally, 1.3 million Dollars abroad.  However to allow for the additional cost of manufacturing this locomotive locally a 2% premium was added onto the local components of the 1.3 million Dollars.  So going back with the cursor 25.2 million Dollars the price in Dollars – I mean 25.2 million Rands the price in Dollars is 2.6.  Just beneath that you have 12.7 million Rands.  It is roughly half of 25.2 million Rands.  But I will get into that shortly.  The foreign bit sits at 12 – sorry 12.5 million Rands and we can see just beneath that the percentage foreign which 50% of the 2.6 million Dollars and it is reflected there as 1.3 million.  I am not sure if the Chair is following    So we are still in that column.  1.3, 12.5, 12.7, 2.6, 25.2.  Your 25.2 is the sum or the addition of those two cells.  I will highlight them in red.  12.7 and 12.5.      It is no – sorry.    Rands.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    So 12 ...(intervenes).     Million Rands.    Correct.    And that is why it is higher than the foreign component.     Had we not had the 2% because we are assuming 50/50 would expected those two figures to be the same.    But because of the 2% premium on the local content it is higher in Rand terms.  And I suppose in your words Chair that principle should follow right through.  And we can test that principle across the various years.  So in 2013 – well year 2013 ending March 2014 12.7 higher than 12.5.  So the 12.7 is the local is higher than the foreign. If we look at the next year we still see the same principle applying.    I am not sure why it is different in that cell.    Correct.    Just a minute.  Okay.  So the reason you see the foreign component increasing at a higher rate than the local component it is because of the hedging cost.  So allowing for that and the escalation you come up with the price locally that is higher than the price abroad and you will likely see that from the table.  If you look at the component prices, the prices make up the 38.6 billion you will see that SA PPI only came in at if we look at the totals – this is slide 13.    The total for SA PPI came in at 1.8 billion however take into account USCPI and FOREX we are looking at about 4 billion.  So the foreign component in terms of price actually increases beyond the local component.  So that is allowing for the exchange rate.    But we can see in the first year allowing for that 50/50 and the 2% above on the – 2% premium the local component is higher than the foreign component.    I think at this point going back to slide 13 I think we will try and derive the 30.476 billion we have there.  Or maybe just focus on the diesel part and try and derive the 11.147.      Correct.  So we can just be ...(intervenes).     Focussed on diesel.    And if we happy with diesels we should happy with electrics.  So Chair we know that the starting price for diesel locomotives was 2.6 million Dollars.    And that was in 2013 – April 2013.  Had they acquired all the diesel locomotives in April 2013 allowing for the 2% localisation they would have paid about 11 billion Rands for those diesel locomotives?  How do you arrive at that?  Should I do a calculation on my end while I speak to it?    Okay.  So we take the ...(intervenes).     Okay.  So we take the 2.6 million Dollars.  The exchange rate that applied at the time was 9.5854 – sorry Chair maybe I should actually take you through the additional cells.    Sorry.    Correct that is the forward rate.  And that is very correct so we should applying the spot rate not the forward rate.  Thanks.      Just check that.  So this – okay so on page 18 yes the spot rate was 9.12185.    1285 correct.    Correct.    So to get the Rand.    Part we take the 2.6 million multiplied by the spot rate at the time and that gives us 23.7 million.  So 23.7341 million Rands.    However this still does not include that 2% localisation.    Okay so the 2% - this price of 23.7341 does not include the 2% localisation premium.  So to this price we need to add the 2% localisation premium.  But the 2% only applies to the local component.  So in effect we adding 1%. Because it is half of 2%.    So we take this 23.7341 and we multiply it by 1.01 and that gives us the price with the localisation premium allowed for.    That gives us a price of 23.971441 per diesel locomotive and that is in Rand terms.  I must state it is different to the 25 that we see here.    Because the 25 that we see here uses the forward rate of 9.585.  We then take this 23 – this price per locomotive at the spot price allowing for the 2% localisation premium and multiply it by the number of diesel locomotives we would have acquired at the time.  In this instance it is 465.  And that gives us 11146.72.    11146.72.    11 – sorry 11,146.72.    Correct.    So had your quite older diesel locomotives as at April 2013 this is what you would have paid in terms of ETC just for your diesels.  Moving that across to electrics it would have been 19.329 billion.  So we are happy that we now have the price of the locomotives.  So anything – that tells us there is a difference then between the 30.476 we seeing the 30.6 billion.  We now need to understand what that difference is?    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    So Chair still focussing on the diesel tab we have shown that the local price increases by a certain amount each year and if I take you to – so I will just highlight the row that I am looking at in red.  If the Chair is able to – is it highlighted there Chair?  No.      Sorry.    I am working off the wrong sheet – my apologies.    My apologies Chair I am working off the wrong sheet.  So Chair that is the row of interest which relates to the price of the local component of the locomotive in Rand terms.      12.7 is the starting price but this 12.7 is based on – if I go further down Chair I will highlight again a row of interest here.  Is based on that exchange rate of 9.59.    Allow to flick between pages.  I think on page 18 again I have put there the table applicable to this forward curve and we can see in year 2014 the rate was 9.5854 rounded off here to 9.59 and that we can increase that for Chair to – there we go.  If I increase the number of decimal places we can see the 5854 coming up.    Correct.    14.30.  So we can see from this that the Rand was expected to depreciate over those years, because the amounts needed in Rand terms per Dollar kept increasing over the years.    Going back to the top row in red.  You can see the 13.7 is a function of the price in the previous year raised – this can be seen.  I highlighted the cells that are affected there, by 5.3%.    The Chair can see that.  So 5.3% feeds into that price as can be seen and if we look at the row where 5.3 comes from.  It is titled SA PPI.    If the Chair is happy with that.  I will again highlight that and that carries on in each of the respective years.  I think for the Chair’s comfort I will look at another 16.6 in this instance and we can see it references 5.5% from the SA PPI row.  So we can see those percentages feed into the locomotive price.    Stated in red.  I will try and demonstrate this for the ZAR foreign component and that is row beneath that.  So I am just going to revert and refer to the row of interest here which is the row just under that and that is the part dealing with the foreign component, but in ZAR terms ...(intervenes).     And I mentioned here this is affected by two quantities. So it can be seen here the 1.3 is affected by the – I will come here.  Exchange rate can be seen there at 10.4.  This however does not include the localisation number you can see on top.    So it takes the value as can be seen Chair.  I just want to show you that it is not just the exchange rate, but also US CPI.  So you will notice that to get to the 12.5 you have got to take the 1.3 just beneath that.  Sorry.  That is already at 9.5.  Use the next one and apply the exchange rate of 10.04 to it.  So I am looking at 13.3 in this instance, because remember the 12.5 is already in Rand terms from the 25.2 on top which used 9.5854. If you look at the next one R13.3 million it takes the $1.3 million beneath it and then multiplies that by the exchange rate.  So R10,00 to the Dollar at the time to give you the price in Rands.    Report.    But I would not want to lose you at any point.    Okay Chair.    Spend some time on it.    Right.    And I appreciate.    Agreed.    Okay.  As mentioned the 30.3 million that we are looking at there is – comes from the 1.3 multiplied by the exchange rate, but where does that 1.3 come from?  It comes from the price in the previous year raised by US CPI and we can see that when I highlight that cell it looks at the 1.3 in the previous year and the 2.2% just beneath in the row labelled US inflation. So we can see US inflation – I am trying to demonstrate that US inflation feeds into the price as can be seen.  SA PPI feeds into the price and this exchange rate series feeds into the price.  I think we can be satisfied that these three variables feed into the price of a locomotive.    That is correct.    Correct.    Huh-uh.    Sorry.    Oh.  This particular slide?    Correct.    To the ...(intervenes).     The worksheet.  Yes.    CPI.    CPI.    The cost of hedging.    Correct.    Correct.    Electric.    Oh for diesel.  Yes.    Diesel.    Correct.    That is correct Advocate.    Yes.    So I take it the Chair is happy that we have gone back to the original case on this worksheet.    We are coming back.    So ...(intervenes).     Okay.    Alright.    So Chair I think we pointed to the 38.6 billion here and we know that is the ETC.  A lot spoken of ETC of the 38.6 billion.  A change in any of the variables we looked at on the previous worksheet should affect this 38.6 billion.  I think I will spare you the trouble of having to show you how that sheet leads into this 38.6 billion, because it is involved in a number of other sheets. As mentioned there are 54 sheets in this model of which 49 or 48 – I think have been used to model the transaction.  So if the Chair will accept and we can demonstrate that by just changing one of these variables ...(intervenes).     And see what impact it has on the 38.6 billion and then start with the revision of this table thereafter.    We change SA PPI, US inflation the forward curve.    Okay.    That will be the exchange rate ...(intervenes).     And I will put a number there that is not reasonable, because I will put zero put in there.    Although you cannot apply – acquire a draft for R0,00 or maybe let us just use R1,00.  So R1,00 per $1,00 under that forward ...(intervenes).     Included the Forex.    Yes.    Okay.  So taking the Chair back to that cell.  I have changed in place of the 9.5854.  I have put zero.    Okay.    Okay.    Is the Chair happy with that?  So it is zero right through.  So ...(intervenes).     And as can be seen Chair that capex comes down to 2.782 billion.  From 38.6 billion to 2.7 billion.  That is ...(indistinct).    But then again as I mentioned you cannot expect the exchange rate to be zero.  That means you are acquiring the locomotive at no cost essentially.    On the foreign component.  Hence that significant drop.    Correct and the NPV.    The model is highly consistent.    Okay.    Oh.    Correct.    So the approach to take here is, let us first try and arrive at 30.476 million.    That we see on the slide.    Yes.  Is that we are going?    Is that where we are going?    Okay.  So we will try and arrive at 30.476 million and again as mentioned that assumes you have acquired all your locomotives as at April 2013.  That means no inflation costs locally and abroad and you are acquiring everything at the spot rate in April 2013.  To do that we have got to change the forward curve role to reflect the spot rate and not the forward curve. So every single number in that row will be 9.1285.  So I will reference that.  So Chair will note that in the first row there where the cursor is we have got 9.1285 which is a spot rage.    We will copy the spot rate right across.    As mentioned we assume no inflation because we are acquiring the locomotives as at 18 April 2013.  So we will plug in zero.  A rate of 0% right across for SA PPI and 0% right across for US CPI.  So as the Chair will see we have got zero right across for SA PPI and zero right across for US CPI. You will notice where my cursor is the localisation premium of 2% is still included.  That as I mentioned is not the 30.476 million.  We could have excluded it, but then we thought being such a tiny amount let us just leave it within the locomotive pricing.  In any case it forms part of the locomotive price, because that is what it would cost you locally to get that local component. Going back to the sheet with the 38.6 billion.  We should expect to see a change in that sheet and we see 32.708 billion in there.  That includes the contingency of 2.2 billion.  We also need to deduct that ...(intervenes).    The spot rate.  Yes.    So we  ...(intervenes).     Correct.    No.  Sorry Advocate.  Can I just ...(intervenes) ?    Follow through.    Two.  Ja.  285.    Correct.    Yes.    And that there was no inflation right through locally ...(intervenes).     And abroad.    Ja and then I have now just deducted the contingency of 2.23 billion, because that as we know was a balance and cost item.    Ja.    Correct.    Taking you back to the main control input sheet.  You will notice Chair that figure is 30.476 billion.  So I have essentially stripped out all the costs from the 38.6 billion to arrive at the pure locomotive.  Aligned with the two percent localisation premium and that ties in with what you have in slide 13.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Shall we continue to derive at the other costs?    Okay.    Should we then continue to derive the other costs?  The 1.8 million.  The 7.13.  The 3358.    13.  Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    We do.    We can do that.    To electrics.  Yes.    Correct.  It would.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.  Yes.    I would say they are.    Yes.    Well 2.23 billion is simply the reserve set aside as per my understanding for capital spares and all of that for the locomotives.  So I understand it was a scientifically derived based on the capital spares that we required for the locomotives.    One must also look at the percentage that it forms as part of the total – of the capital costs.    It is about 7%.  If I am not mistaken.  I find that reasonable.    Correct.    So Chair I think we discussed this briefly earlier on.  It is one thing to show slide 13 with a breakdown of what the R38.6 billion include, but that is not proof enough that the 38.6 billion includes inflation and foreign currency hedging and the costs that we claim it to be and even if it did.  It is not proof enough that those were the – it includes them to those amounts. To the extent reflected on slide 13.  Specifically with reference to the forward curve applied.  The argument could be fair and fine.  You have foreign currency forecasts in there.  There may seem to just be forecasts and not foreign exchange hedge rates as Transnet calls them.    The difference?    Okay.    So the forward curve as we have seen and as we have been discussing gives you rates at which a commercial bank would contract with you for the Dollar in future.  In other words they are prepared to pay at the end of year one R9.5854 to the Dollar to every Dollar you bring forward or give you a Dollar for every R9.5854 that you bring to them.  Okay. So they contract with you on that basis on those rates.  So regardless of what the exchange rate does they will stick to the agreement and exchange currency with you at the stipulated rate.    With a forecast it takes into account other factors.  It is not a rate that you are certain to get in future.  It is not contractible.  It is simply a view on where the currency is going to be in time to come in the future basically going forward.  The process of arriving at Forex hedged rates and that used to arrive at forecasted rates are different.  The processes are different. For hedged rates you look at the differences in interest rates in the current – in the countries of interest.  Okay.   It is based on what is termed.  Sorry to introduce jargon here.  Arbitrage-free pricing.  In other words there is no free lunch.  So considering that you have R100,00 today and you have a choice between investing it in a Money Market Account here and with a foreign country of interest is the US.  Okay. Investing it in a Money Market Account in the US.  The forward rate is that which equates the investment at the end of the year.  So effectively you are not in a better position investing in the States or investing locally and that is how your forward curve is derived.     The one overhead?     Correct.     That is the forward curve yes.     From the Treasury Department where the Treasury Department obtained it from?     From the Treasury Department.     Well in this instance the Treasury Department would assist with foreign currency, risk hedging, they would obtain these rates it’s not sure whether it’s internally or on the market.     Correct.     15?     Okay so essentially we’re trying to dispel the argument that the rates used there could have been forecasted rates and not necessarily forward exchange rates – forward curve rates basically.  So what we did is and hence my explanation in terms of – well my explanation of how the forward curve is derived versus forecasted rates, the processes used to derive at those two curves are different, your forecasted rates versus your forward rates.  Forward rates, there’s a deterministic process it does not matter where you go, you will get the same forward curve if you’re looking at two countries of interest at a particular point in time, they are based on interest rates, locally and abroad, in this case the United States and in particular where South Africa is concerned we’re looking at the Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate okay which is the average of the deposit rates across the banks in South Africa and that is a terminal figure.  You can pick that off, it’s market data available it’s the same wherever you pick it up to try and source it from and LIBOR in the United States which is the London Interbank Offered Rate okay it’s an average of money market rates. We then went on to the markets to understand, as at April 2013 given this stream of cash-flows which is the cash-flows that Transnet would have like to hedge at the time okay for the locomotives – with a seven-year delivery schedule what would the forward curve have looked like at the time allowing for the brokerage fees, transaction costs, that a bank would charge over and above the forward curve to enter into a contract with Transnet.  We did that exercise and what we have there as your Bloomberg forward written fact, this was obtained from Bloomberg, okay if you perform the same exercise of Thompson Routers you should get the same curve.  So you approach any bank as at April 2013 you should get this forward curve because at that date you knew what the spot rate is because your forward curve is a function of your spot rate at the time, it’s a function of your Jibar rates going forward at that point in time and is a function of your Libor rates going forward at that point in time and those rates are not variable, they’re stated because the average is across a number of entities on the market.       So looking at that curve we can see that the rates – the curve derived from Bloomberg pretty much mirrors the curve that Transnet Treasury applied to the 1064 business case.     The curve derived from Bloomberg mirrors that applied by Transnet’s Treasury Department.     Correct.     They’re very minor and they relate to differences between bank charge between banks in terms of their charges.     Correct, the financial model.     Correct, so as mentioned earlier there were two exchange rate tables applied in the business case, the forward curve and forecasted rates and if the Chair recalls, based on our discussions earlier I actually put that table under maintenance cost to reflect where they were applied.  They were applied purely to forecast maintenance costs. Transnet’s policy, below a certain threshold does not require you to go and hedge exposures.  Maintenance costs fell below that threshold hence a forecast was sufficient for modelling purposes in this instance and as can be seen these are the forecasted rates used in the financial model.  These forecasted rates are quite different to the forward curve rates as can be seen. These rates, actually, in certain instances show an appreciation in the rand, we know from our forward curve we see a depreciation in the Rand right through to 2022.  That is the difference between the two, forward curve rates were applied for ETC, Global Insight Forecasted Rates were applied for maintenance costs and maintenance costs do not form part of ETC, they form part of TCO hence the distinction that’s why we went through the cost I had to show you, TCO and what TCO is made up of, ETC and then you have your personnel costs, your maintenance costs, your fuel costs, your emission costs and so forth.  So it really, I think we have demonstrated that they were applied, forecasted rates were applied but not to ETC and what was applied in modelling the ETC was the forward curve which was verified using market data.     Correct.     Correct.     Correct.     Yes.     Concluding slide?     Do I have a different slide on ...(intervenes).      Okay so look at the mandate I think it entailed assessing whether the 38.6 billion was an acceptable estimate for the ETC, our view is, yes it was and acceptable ETC at the time.  Did it include Forex hedging rates, it did, did it allow for Forex hedging, it did, did it allow for Forex hedging costs, it did, did it include escalation, it did, I think we have demonstrated that by zero rising some of those costs and observing the impact on the 38.6 billion, so yes it allowed for all of those for those two costs in particular, escalation locally and abroad and Forex hedging and was an acceptable estimate.     Correct.     It’s fine.     Okay.     To what sorry?     Correct.     15.9 is the increase yes.     Okay so I think just to reiterate what the mandate was here identify the reasons put forward for the increase from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion that represents a 15.9 billion increase in the ETC.  Assess the quantum’s, asses the reasonability of those reasons, assess the reasonability of the amounts next to those reasons okay and give an opinion on a reasonable increase over the period, it was, essentially a one-year period from April 2013 to March 2014.  Should I carry on to the finding?     Alright.     Okay should we at this point then refer to the memorandum on the first page?     It says, to the Transnet Board of Directors from the Group CEO at the time.     That is the one.     Okay so Chair, the reason for this memo I guess the     You are correct okay; can I however revert back to the previous slide which also captures this?     Slide 24 okay.     Okay.     So Chair, slide 24 essentially replicates that table in the memo on the slide.  Now I’ll take you through the various components.  I think to facilitate understanding let me just go back to this slide and explain to you how this slide links to table two or am I jumping the gun as per my statement?     Okay.     Okay so this table is a replica of what we have in the Executive summary in the – those are the reasons advanced for the increase in ETC.  Starting off with the first one, the reason put forward was an update of the business case for updated economic factors and I think I have captured that verbatim and that amounted to 5.4 billion.  I have 5.39 billion but essentially it is 5.4 billion or roundabout and that accounts for 34% of the increase in ETC, so essentially of that 15.9 billion.  The second reason put forward, before I explain each of those is risk mitigation looking at Forex and escalation amounting to 9.5 billion and that makes up 59% of the ETC, I mean of the ETC increase of 15.9 billion.  We then have TE scope at an amount of 2.6 billion making up 16% of the increase in ETC, we have contingencies, contingencies have gone up in this instance if you recall Chair it was 2.232 billion from the business case it is now 4.9 billion or 4.95 billion to be exact and that’s 31% of that increase and in addition to that there was, according to the memo, a saving and I’ll just read it verbatim, what the source of that saving is, it says, “Lower capital acquisition costs of the locomotive obtained through the competitive tender and negotiation process less the batch pricing adjustment of 2.7 billion”, And that saving is noted at 6.5 billion Rands making up negative 41% of that 15.9 billion Rand increase.     Correct.     Correct.     Correct.     I cannot pick up the saving when I look at it, when I go through the memo.     I can’t pick up a saving.     I suppose it will become clearer as we go through the relevant cost items starting off with the locomotive price but they do not contain ...(intervenes).      Okay.     If I can?     To try and identify or locate the 6.5 billion saving?     I suppose at this point we look at the more detailed table two.     Of AC5, that is correct Chair.     Table two of AC5.     Gives you a build-up from the locomotive price right up to the 54.5 billion.     I have put it overhead and it’s the middle column.     Correct but the middle column reflected this table but it doesn’t have the numbers ...(intervenes).      I think we will have – the next half an hour.     Correct but only so far as linking, going through table two and linking that to the table in the Executive summary.     I was told the witness would be only one day and tomorrow got given other commitments.     I’ll work according to your schedule Chair.     With a cup of tea at some point yes.    Certainly Chair I would.
