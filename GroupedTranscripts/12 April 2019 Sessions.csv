CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Before we start I just want to announce that my decision in regard to Mr Moyane’s application for leave to cross-examine Minister Gordhan will be handed down on Tuesday next week at half past nine.  Notification will be sent by the secretary, acting secretary to the parties.  Thank you.    Are you ready?    Yes, yes.    Thank you.    I just want you if you do not mind just to go back that sentence about what he said I just want to make sure I hear it.    Okay.    Yes.  Oh okay.    Did you say Yd Mr Pretorius?    Okay and page 133?    Oh okay.    Yes.    Yes.  From my part I just – you had made a – you had made a statement – a sentence in what you had said that I had not heard correctly and I just wanted you to repeat that so that I understood it.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.   H’m.    Thank you.    Did you ever have occasion to confront the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee afterwards and ask him how this so called sub judice rule could have prevented him from allowing you to address the committee but not prevented himfrom allowing the Minister to deal with the same issue?    What is the page number again Mr Pretorius?      Thank you.    Oh well all I can say is that I see a divider marked E.  I am only saying what I see.  Your junior is looking at you.    As if to say you hear.  Yes.    Are you finding it Mr McBride?    Okay.    Okay so we should put them away for now?    Okay.    Is that in the same bundle?    875?    Thank you.  Well my last page in the same bundle is 4 something.  Is it B?  Okay.  Yb.  Are you able to find it?  Look for ones that is written Yb Mr McBride.    Ja page 875.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    So we must not use them now.    Okay.    Just for the sake of completeness and for whoever may be listening who has not – or who might not be familiar with a lot of background to these things just state again what Werksmans mandate was; what had the Minister asked them to do?  What was their brief in other words?   Oh but not necessarily that you need to be accurate in terms of how it is but your own understanding subject to whatever is written in black and white.    Ja, no I thought because you were - in your evidence you were criticising the Minister for not allowing process.    To continue.  It is important for everyone to know what the Werksmans mandate was at least as you understood it.    Ja.    Yes, okay.    That is YD?    Page 17?   75.    Thank you.    I do not have paragraph 5 at page 1375 of EXHIBIT YD.    Yes, I do.    Yes.    Okay - okay, alright.    Thank you.    Hm.    Hm.    Have you found it Mr McBride?   Yes, okay.    So - but your comment Mr McBride is as you understand he effect of what they are saying here is.    We do not know.    Who among the three?    Altered the report?    But then they must all be charged both criminally and in terms of disciplinary steps.  That is what you are saying.  That is what you say it – it actually boils down to that paragraph?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    You did not say so expressly but I think from what you were saying you were confirming that my understanding of what you were saying about that paragraph that was read to you was correct.  My understanding – I take you to be confirming that what I put to you as your understanding of it or your comment on it was correct.    Yes.    Okay, alright.    Because I just wanted to make sure but you talked about it further but I want to know whether I was correct in understanding it.  Can I also ask this?  I think one of the things you have said is that they – Werksmans – seem not to have bothered to ask the question to the extent that there may have been an alteration of the report.  Was that alteration lawful or not lawful?  That is one of the things that I think you are saying.  Is that right?    So you are saying they did not look into an issue that was critical because if the alteration was correct there would be no basis to say anybody – anybodymust be charged criminally or if – if the alteration was lawful there would be no basis to say somebody must be charged criminally?    And you say on your understanding of the report they ignored that very important issue which they should have considered?    Okay.    Yes.  No – no I accept.    No, I accept that.    I just wanted to make sure that I understand what his thinking is about the report.    Maybe let me assist.  When Werksmans was asked to do what they were asked to do were you already on suspension?    You were not yet on suspension.  Are you able to recall how long after they were given this brief you were suspended more or less?  A month, two months, three months?    About a month or so?    Before you were suspended had you had any interaction with them within that month or so after they were asked to do the work?    Through an email?    Yes, okay and their report – how long after you went on suspension did it come out if you are able to tell?  Three months, four months, five months, six months?    Yes.    Your interview with them?    Yes.    Yes, okay.  The events in connection with which you were suspended as you understand them.  Were they some of the events that were dealt with by them in their report?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay, alright.  Mr Pretorius I do not know if that has helped.    Hm.    Mr Pretorius I do not know whether I missed something.  We are now talking about what happened after the outcome of his case in the Constitutional Court.  I do not remember us looking at the letter of his suspension, seeing what reasons were given by the Minister for his suspension, but also I want to know Mr McBride between your suspension and General Dramat’s suspension which one came first?    Was it not Dramat’s one?    Yes.  So also with regard to that I do not know what your plan may be.  I would prefer that we deal with them in the sequence in which they happened and we exhaust them like we exhaust Dramat’s suspension and then move to his and so on and so on.    Oh, those.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.  No – no I.    Ja.  No – no I understand that but from – from what he said to me when I asked him the questions that were meant to clarify what you were asking him.  It is – it is clear that the actual report came after his suspension.  So I am just saying forme it would be very helpful if we deal with those events if possible the way they followed each other.  Of course there may be good reason sometimes to change that.  It is just that once we deal with what happened after his success in the Constitutional Court when we have exhausted how he was suspended, what the reasons were that were given it is a little difficult to follow.    Yes.    Okay.    But I understand your – your concern about sorting out the pagination that.    That I understand.  So as long as you are alive to my concern it is fine.  Let us continue.  At a certain stage it will help if whoever is listening can just see the sequence properly.    And I think it is important to – it may be important to look at the sequence because of events which – which event came after which event because there may be significance even in why that particular event happened after that one.    What page again, four?    Thank you.    Hm.    It is EXHIBIT Y, B for Beatrice and it is at page 447.  Of course where we say 447 or did you say 448?  447 I think you said.    Oh 448.  I am sorry.  We are leaving out the zero before four.  So if you look at it, it will read 0448 but we are just saying 448.    Do you want to repeat your question Mr Pretorius on paragraph 10?    No, I am sorry 448.    I got it wrong earlier.  He said 447.  It is 448.    Paragraph 10.    I think Mr Pretorius was referring to that paragraph and saying you would know those events yourself.  You want to say something about what is said in paragraph 10?     Well unless having looked at it he thought, or he was not persuaded by it maybe, is that a possibility as you see the matter, or you think he definitely did not see it otherwise he would not have acted the way he acted?     Yes.     And he did not do that.     Yes but do you – you have said that there exists somewhere a written proof that the second report was delivered to his office.     Yes, okay I’m sure the commission will try and get that (indistinct) but you have no reason to – you know of no reason why, if he’s office did get it why it wouldn’t have been given to him.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes and if he put that kind of deadline it must mean it was very important for him that he receives it and that it was also urgent.    And one would have expected that if he didn’t receive it he would have brought that to your attention in one way or another to say, what has happened.        Okay.    Yes.    What’s the page number again?    Thank you, have you found it Mr McBride?    No that’s fine.    Now you are talking about – at what stage exactly was it at the stage he sent you a letter giving you two days within which to give him the report, is that what you are talking about?      Okay and you are saying that the communication whether it was – I think it was in writing you said.     Are you saying your recollection is that the letter made it clear that he was aware that there was a preliminary report and a final report or at least that there were two reports?    Yes you say, that letter made it clear that he was aware of that?      The final report?     Okay maybe just so that we are – my impression yesterday was that when you prepared the final report you were aware that there was a report that had been sent to the NPA that had been signed by Mr Khuba only but what you are saying now is, as at the time of asking Mr Khuba to do further investigations and as at the time of signing the final report, you were not aware that there’s a report that Mr Khuba had sent to the NPA.  You were only aware that a docket had been sent to the NPA is that right?     And you have made the distinction that there’s a docket and there’s a report.     And I think yesterday I asked you whether, when they submitted the docket and the report are submitted at the same time but you made the distinction that there’s the docket and then there’s the report, the report is an opinion as you put it.     So when Khuba gave you a briefing, remember you told us that you asked for an update on all high profile cases and Khuba among others gave you anupdate on this so-called rendition matter, he did  not say there was a report he had sent to the NPA already?     Yes so – but he told you there was a docket that was sent to the NPA.     And it may be that in his mind if he talked about the docket it included the report as well.     But your own understanding didn’t include a report at the time.     Ja but you have said that the letter that came from the Minister where he asked – gave you two days within which to give him the final report, you have said that, that letter – the contents of the letter were such that it was clear that the Minister had in mind a preliminary report and another report – final report.    Yes before complying – or was it asking that you should provide both reports to him, is that what it was asking?    All reports.     Oh and then that’s the only report you then gave?     So it said all reports and not necessarily preliminary report and final report?    Oh okay and then you just gave him what you understood to be the only report?     Yes and did you immediately check with Khuba whether there was any report in the light of the letter of the Minister’s talk about all reports?     Ja but let me go back to my question, did you talk to Mr Khuba to say, the Minister has asked for all reports, I just want to make sure that there are no other reports other than this one, are there other reports that you know of, did you ask him anything along those lines?     Yes, okay no thank you.  Mr Pretorius I see we have gone...(intervention).    Yes let’s take the short adjournment.INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes you may proceed Mr Pretorius.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius before that let us go back to paragraph 7.      Where the Minister says   And then he says   That you may have to be suspended?    Which would be before he may have writ – before he could write you any letter saying tell me why I should not suspend you?  I understand him to be talking about the period that would have preceded that time namely the time when he wrote    He did not do that?    Inviting you to.    Yes.    H’m.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay.  No no that is fine.    Just to – for – in terms of what I am really interested in in terms of my    So at this stage all I want to know is whether prior to him writing to you a letter along the lines that he was contemplating suspending you, make your representations had he invited you to explain any conduct on your part regarding what he had dealt with above?    That had not happened?    And you are sure about that?    Okay in the letter where he was asking you to make representations is that is how he put it did he – did he include any complaint that he invited you to explain some conduct before and you did not explain anything?  Was that included in that letter as far as you recall or you cannot recall?    Yes.    Yes.    Oh no I am sorry this is the letter where he is asking you for representations I see at the end of the letter.    This is the one – ja.  So – so obviously when he says in paragraph 7so this is not the letter of suspension.  I thought it was the letter of suspension.    This is not the letter of suspension this is the letter where he was in effect saying to you he was contemplating suspending you.  He was inviting you to make representations?    So obviously in paragraph 7 when he says he invited you to explain your conduct regarding the above obviously he is talking about something that must have happened before that letter if it did happen but you are saying you are clear that prior to this letter.    He had never invited you to explain any conduct on your part to him?    Regarding – regarding the events he is dealing with in this letter?    Okay alright thank you.    Mr Pretorius I made the mistake of thinking that this was the letter of suspension.  The letter of suspension would be the one that actually suspends is it not?  This was a letter saying I am contemplating suspending you.  I just do not want any reader to think when you are talking about paragraph 8 on this letter you are talking about paragraph 8 on another letter that actually does the suspending.    We need to – to make some distinction.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    No that is fine.  I am just saying be alive to avoid confusion.    In case there is a letter of suspension later on.    This is the one that we have talked about and paragraph 8 is at page 187.    Yes ja.    He seems to say in paragraph 8 if I understand him correctly.  His complaint seems to be you should not have written to the Portfolio Committee about this issue while the investigation by Werksmans which he had commissioned was pending.  That is what seems to be his complaint.  So in other words he might not be complaining about you writing to the Portfolio Committee as such but he seems to be saying while Werksmans had been asked by him to look into among others this issue you should not have done so.    So is part of your comment that arising out of the independence of IPID and the fact that it was duty bound to account to Parliament and that Parliament was – is different from the executive if there was an issue that you believed the Portfolio Committee should be informed about as head of IDIP you were within your rights and maybe you will say you may have been obliged to actually bring it to the attention of the Portfolio Committee and ask for an opportunity to brief the Portfolio Committee.  That is part of what you are saying.    Hm okay.    Summonsed who?  I am sorry.  Summonsed who?    Oh, okay.    So are you sure therefore that in that meeting he did not extend to you the invitation that he talks about in paragraph 7 of the letter?    He did not?    Yes.  Okay.    Yes.    Hm.  So if I understand you well the first part of what he said to you at that meeting was abusive?    But the last bit which he said to you was like he was just joking withyou?    Yes, okay.  Thank you.  Yes Mr Pretorius.    Actually you were not – you had not started at IPID by?    February 2014?    Because you only started in March.    Yes.    When you explained to the Minister in that meeting when General Ntlemeza was there the circumstances under which you had taken possession of the device from General Sibiya’s office did he seem to have anything he was not accepting about that explanation?  Did he seem to not to believe what you were saying?  Did he seem to have any problem or did he seem to accept?    After you had given the explanation/    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Was that device relevant to the investigation that General Sibiya may have been conducting in regard to General Mdluli as far as you understood what you were told by?    Sibiya?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  [Intervenes].    I am sorry Mr McBride I am interrupting you.    But the question is you said in the letter that the Minister was aware at all times and the question is on what basis were you saying as at 12 March 2015 that he had been aware at all times of the two reports.    Yes.    Yes.   Hm.    In the High Court application?    Ja, but the – if it was an attachment to the High Court affidavit it would have been written either before the High Court affidavit was done or on the same day.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    So what was contained in the High Court affidavit cannot explain the basis on which you said the Minister had been aware of the two.  So I think what is more important is to look at prior to the writing of this letter what it is that gave you the basis but you have said that his letter had said – maybe if that letter is here we should go to it once and for all.    Yes.  Oh, okay alright.  Is there anything else that makes you – that would have made you believe as at the time you wrote that letter that he was aware atall times of the two reports or is it only what he wrote in his letter?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    It is the same office?    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.     Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Okay.    Just – so, so part of what you are saying is if one appreciates the distinction between the evidence that is in the docket which – the evidence that is put into the docket after investigation and the report.    If one appreciates the distinction about the status of these two.    Whatever may have been done whatever a report says in the end really should not make much different - and you must just tell me I am testing whether that is what you are saying – should make one you know much difference if in the end you look at the evidence in the docket and you are the person who must make a decision because your decision must be based on the evidence and not so much on the report?    Yes.    Yes and that would be your position whether we are talking about the interim or preliminary report of the final report?    Is that correct?    But in the end it is the evidence that must count?    And what is said in the report whether you are the prosecutor in theNPA who must make a decision or you are the Minister in the end really your final decision about what should happen or what is being said should be what is in the docket by way of evidence?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    And prosecutes.    Yes.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Okay.    And, and as a general proposition do not blame me for my opinion.    That is – make your decision on the evidence.  If you want to have regard to my opinion have regard to it but in the end remember that you must make your decision on the basis of evidence.   That is part of what you are saying?    Ja.    In other words you, you might have a situation where you do not agree with my opinion.    But that does not necessarily mean that I am wrong.  That does not necessarily mean that you are right and it does not necessarily - it might not necessarily mean that my opinion is based on incompetence on my part.    But there may be situations where the opinion I give is so bad that you think it reflects incompetence in which case you might be concerned about that and there may be a way as to how that should be dealt with?    Hm, okay.    Have you moved to another bundle Mr Pretorius?    Are you moving to another bundle?    Y, B for Beatrice, okay.    The page number again.    448.    Okay.    Four years hey – four years.    You said few.    I’m not going to make a note I assume you might hand something up that reflects that...(intervention).    In due course, that’s fine.    No, no I’m saying you can say it but I won’t make notes here.    Later on you can give me something that reflects that.    But you can just tell us.    Ja that will be helpful.    Ja that will be helpful.    Your junior is being very helpful to you, yes.    Ja it’s very interesting it’s around Christmas time.    Ja thank you.  We’re going back to Exhibit YA...(intervention).    And this was on the same day that you went in to give your warning statements, your arrest?       Okay.     Are they withdrawn on the same day, first appearance or second or later appearance?     Okay but you can’t remember whether that would have been second, third or fourth appearance as such.     Okay.    Yes thank you we will take the lunch adjournment. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Well I wanted to ask you something along those lines.  Do you know or do you not know whether the police and the prosecutor in regard to the criminal charges against you had any statements from witnesses?    And I think you said either yesterday or today I think yesterday that you tried to obtain or you requested certain documents that are normally given to an accused person but these were denied to you, is that right?    Yes.  So as you sit here you do not know who may have signed any statement that the prosecutor or the police was in possession of at the time?  You do not know whether there were or there were no statements?    Yes.  Okay alright.  And you did ask for statements?    Yes.  And was the request in writing do you know?    Yes.  But it was as far as you know it was a written request rather than a verbal request maybe on the day of first appearance or anything like that or youdo not know?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    YEs.    Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.    Are you pursuing this part Mr Pretorius or it is another part?    In regard to the criminal charges or not really?    Oh.    Okay maybe I should just say to the extent that Mr McBride may be saying that the criminal charges really had no basis whatsoever and that it was part of something more than just a genuine laying of charges by whoever.  It might be good toknow exactly what was there.    Within – ja in the docket because obviously if there was nothing other than the Werksmans Report it might mean a certain thing but one would normally expect that there will be certain statements by some witnesses.    Ja.    Yes.  Yes okay alright.    I am sorry Mr Pretorius before you go there.  Still in 35 you – you take issue with the allegation by Minister Nhleko that he had received the two reports from IPID.    But I understood you earlier on before lunch when you gave evidence and we posed questions with regard to I think paragraph 7 of the Minister’s letter to you about intention to suspend you.    Where you said – no, no I think we were dealing with our response to his letter.    Where you said he was always aware that there were two reports.  You remember?    We asked you questions what was the basis for you to say the Minister was at all times aware that there were two reports.      Now I understood you to be saying to us one to be saying among other things that you that is IPID had given the Reference Group everything that youhad given to the NPA.    I undertook that to mean that therefore you would have given to the Reference Group documents which included the first report to the extent that the NPA may have had that.  And if my understanding is correct then is the position not therefore that the Minister may have got that report from the interim from the Reference Group?    Oh okay.    But other than that the one that was given to the Reference Group was not signed was it otherwise the same report in terms of content as – or …    Or you did not have a chance to check the contents?    Ja.    Okay, okay.    Well this has now reminded me of a question I wanted to ask earlier.  I hope I did not ask it and I am repeating it.  Is there – was there anything in what we have been referring to as the first report now and from what you say it could be that it is a number of documents you know not just one document.  Was there anything that if somebody read or saw in that first report that could tell him or her this is not final or this cannot be final?  Or was there anything that one could pick up which could clearly say but this I cannot rely on this, this is not a final report?  Or is it – or you are not sure?    Yes.    Yes.    YEs.    Yes, ja.      Ja okay thank you.    Exhibit Yc?    Yes.    I think 1266.    And that email seems to be dated what 20 May 2015?    Oh.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes no that is fine.    Are you back to his statement?    Oh.    I am not sure if you did announce.  I thought you were taking us to another page on Yd?    ja.    Okay.    Okay.    Maybe before he answers Mr Pretorius it is important for those who are not looking at the document to mention that the words “two reports” are in quotes.    Well maybe, maybe let me say this because I hope I am right in thinking I understand this.  Mr McBride we talked yesterday about first report and a second report and we said the first – when we are talking about the first report we are talking about one that was signed by Mr Khuba only?    And we said that it was sent to the NPA?    And there was then a second report which we also refer to as the final report?    And that one was signed by three people?    It was signed by Mr Khuba.  It was signed by Mr Sesoko.    Sesoko, yes and it was signed by you.  So that one had threesignatures?    That is the one that you regarded as the final report?    Yes and here in this paragraph you talk about two reports and you put that in quotes?    Saying that the Minister appointed Werksmans to investigate the “two reports” which you say he falsely alleged he had been given by IPID.  As I understand what you are saying is you, you say – when you say that you gave the Minister, IPID gave the Minister one report you are talking about a report that was signed and the one that was signed that IPID gave to the Minister is only the one that was signed by three people, yourself, Khuba and Sesoko.  That is the only signed report you gave to the Minister?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.   Ja, let us, let us leave out for now what the Minister, which one the Minister relied upon.    So we know that you gave the Minister the report that had three signatures?    Okay and that is the one you regard as the final report and that is the report that you provided to the Minister after he gave you a deadline of two days, okay.  You have also said that you gave the Minister at the same time – I think – at the same time an unsigned report that came from Mr Khuba’s computer?    Is that right?    And, but you said as I understood you earlier - I do not know now - as I understood you, you were saying that you did not include the report that was signed by Mr Khuba only that bore his signature alone.  That one you did not include when you were sending the final one to the Minister?    Yes and, and that is why you said at some stage to the extent thatthe Minister may have received the report that was signed by Mr Khuba only.  He could only have received that from the NPA?    Yes.  Okay, now I understand.  The only question I have arising out of paragraph 35 in the light of that is if as you say the report that was unsigned that basically came from Mr Khuba’s computer which you sent to the Minister together with the final report.    If as you seem to suggest it was really nothing to attach much importance to why did you send it?    But I would have thought that if your attitude was anything unsigned is - has no status as you say I would have thought that you, you would not wanted to send him something that has got no status.  You would have, you would have said look the only report that really is official is this one that is signed by three people.  Anything else is really, has no official status and there is no point in sending you anything like that.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, but to the extent that the Minister may have been saying he was given two reports by IPID to the extent that he may – he regarded or may have regarded the unsigned report that you sent him as a report when you said two reports if he meant the one with three signatures and the one with only two - with – and the one without any signature.  Then he would be correct in that regard to the extent that in his own mind it was still a report even if it was not signed?    Then it would be correct?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes, but you said you did not – IPID did not give him the signed, the?    The one signed by Khuba only but if he is talking about reports that he got from IPID.    His statement could only be correct if he regarded the unsigned report as also a report?    Okay, thank you.    Yes.    So you, you – is the position that you have reservations that the errors with the, your email address were bona fide.  Is that what you are saying?  You think it was, it may have been more than a genuine error.    Because it could be a genuine error on its own.  So I am just wondering whether, whether how much point you want to make out of it and I am not saying do not make whatever point you make and I understand the bigger picture of what was happening with you schedule but I just want to know ultimately how muchpoint you want to make about it.  So that I know if there is quite some point or if you simply say I cannot go beyond simply saying I am putting a question mark.  That is all or you might say no I go beyond that actually blah, blah, blah, blah.    Yes.    And you do not take it beyond that?    Hm.    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Okay.    That is fine.    Yes.  No, thank you.    I see that in that paragraph namely 41 you say that   I saw that while there is a separate appointment authority in regard to the Director - Executive Director of IPID.  It looks like everybody else at IPID is appointed by the Executive Director.  Was I right in understanding it that way?  In other words the Executive Director gets appointed in a certain way by whatever body but everyone else under the Executive Director gets appointed – when I say gets appointed by the Executive Director I am sure there may be other people who below the Executive Director who appoint other people but I am saying there is nobody outside of IPID who is given the power to appoint anybody below the Executive Director.  Is that right?    And I would then imagine that when – if that is the case I would imagine that the decision to suspend anybody at IPID other than the Executive Director or Acting Executive Director would be a decision to be made by somebody within IPID not outside of IPID?   Yes, no, no I accept that but you say here it was the Minister who instructed him to suspend and my question is why would the Minister get involved in giving instructions what the Acting Executive Director who he should suspend and who he should not suspend?     But the – part of what you are saying is that Mr Sesoko wanted to challenge the role of the Minister in his suspension, is that part of what you are saying, as far as you understand?     But in terms of your saying that this was – the suspension of Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba that, that was done on the instructions of the Minister of Police, were you basing that on what you heard from Mr Sesoko?     Talking to you about the conversation he had, had with Mr Kgamanyana, is that right?     Oh so you could hear what the discussion said.     Okay, alright thank you.     Yes, okay thank you.    Sorry Mr Pretorius what you have just said are you making two points, maybe one point with two bases namely that even if the Minister was not dealing with an entity that has a special status of independence such as IPID, it would have been wrong for him to get – even if he was dealing with any other government department as Minister he would have known that it was – it would have been wrong for him to get involved in those operational matters but you say because of the special position of IPID in terms of its independence that it was not right, it should have been even much more obvious.     Okay.     So given what the further investigation that Mr Khuba had done on your instructions, given what he had got, what you are saying is that unless somebody were to challenge what Mr Khuba got as fabricated or wrong, unless somebody could challenge the correctness of that they should have not quibble with the fact that – with the conclusion of the second report.     You should only quibble with it if you don’t accept the correctness ofwhat Mr Khuba came up with in the further investigations.     Otherwise you’re quibbling with the conclusion of the second report without challenging that, without saying that information is wrong, it’s difficult to understand.     To consider that there may be something that you did not understand.     Yes.     Well I would imagine that if you have, before you documents on the basis of which you must make a decision and somebody has given an opinion in regard to the information that is placed before you.  You’d look at the opinion, you’d look at the information and  you may agree with them you might not agree with them and you -  particularly if you don’t agree with them you try an understand their reasons for theirdifferent view so that you can test that against your own and given that if having received an opinion in a certain direction subsequently there’s an opinion that is in the opposite conclusion it seems that it will be natural for you to want to say, what’s the basis for this different or latest opinion and therefore you look at the material on which it is based and you may agree with its – the conclusion of the second opinion you might not agree but you would need to look at that.  If you just look at the opinion and you don’t go beyond that, it will be strange.  Do you know whether the Minister or Mr July who were questioning the correctness of the material that led to the second report, in terms of the discussions you had with Mr July in terms of any communication, correspondence with the Minister, did they ever say, but that information is incorrect on the base – which was obtained after you had arrived?     Yes.     That relates to the conclusion reached in the second report.  If there was an alteration to the extent that there may have been an alteration, a physical alteration of the first report, if that alteration was meant to reflect the latest position after the second report there ought to have been no problem with that if nobody had aproblem with the basis for the second report’s conclusion.     So in the interview that you had with Mr July what did he say, if he did say, he found wrong or he thought was wrong with the alteration in the first report?     (Indistinct).     It was simply whether it was changed.     Why it was changed, what grounds were there whether they were good grounds, that was not discussed or he did not – he was not looking into that?     Yes.     Was the concern about the alteration of the first report directed at the recommendation, in other words was the concern more about in effect, I don’t know whether other people said this but you see now,  in the first report – in the first report you said prosecute now the second report says don’t prosecute was that the focus or not really it was just the mere alteration or both?     And in this regard I remember that yesterday you said Mr Khuba said or either Mr Khuba or Sesoko said that the acting Executive Director at the timebefore you had given instructions that Mr Sesoko should be bypassed, is that correct?     In relation to the so-called rendition investigation.      Okay.    Sorry Mr Pretorius, Mr McBride I’m going to put a question to you just be careful when you answer it because you need to answer it, you need to be clear about answering it.  Is your evidence that – does it go so far as to say that anybody who was aware of the additional evidence those – that cell phone analysis and had read it and who was not challenging it, who was not saying it was incorrect, who was not saying it was fabricated, could not really have concluded that there was a problem with the second report or with the – with such alteration as may have taken place, if it was to reflect the outcome of the second report are you able to go that far or not really?    Okay.  I think you – I think your last sentence you are quite careful about how you are putting it.  Thank you.    Thank you.      What page again?    Thank you.      No.    That is fine.    We will adjourn at four o’clock today but next week we will see sometimes we will take a – adjourn later than four o’clock sometimes start earlier.  So I hope that we will all be able to accommodate the various changes.  Thank you very much.  So on Monday shall we start at half past nine?    Ja.   Ja.    Yes, yes.  Would that be fine with you Mr McBride if we were to start at half past nine?    Yes.  Okay then on Monday let us start at half past nine.  We will then adjourn until Monday.      We adjourn. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Noted thank you Chair.      Yes we are ready Chair.  May we continue?    Thank you.    Mr McBride before we adjourned yesterday afternoon we were at paragraph 27 of your statement.      You were explaining to the Chair that you had certain concerns that you wish to raise with the oversight body of IPID.    The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Police.  You said that you had contacted Mr Francois Beukman the Chair of the Portfolio Committee and requested that you be allowed to address them to clarify certain issues.  You told the Chair that Mr Beukman declined your offer to speak to them and in support of his declining your offer he cited the sub-judice rule?    Whether that is an appropriate recourse to the rule of sub-judice is another question we need not go into with you now but is it correct as you said that subsequent to your request the Minister actually addressed the Portfolio Committee?    Would you tell the Chair about that please?    It is at page 1333 in bundle Yd.  It is the first documents in File D, page 1333 right in the front.    Yd.    1333.   You go and help him.      Perhaps we should deal with the background before you get to the detail.    Just those first three paragraphs on page 1. If you could place those on record and then deal with the detailed answer that you give.    Mr McBride my invitation was just for the first page you can deal with the paragraphs that you want to deal with now.  I am not sure it is necessary to go through the whole presentation unless of course you want to?    That against the background in terms of which you were refused an offer to address the Portfolio Committee which is the direct supervising body Parliamentary speaking of IPID, is that correct?    Alright.      Can I ask you or may I ask you Mr McBride to go to Annexure J page 448 that is in bundle B.  Yb.      Page 448.    I am told very sternly by my junior Chair that it is not J but I will check that independently.      Quite justifiably Chair.    Let us just go to J where is it?    If you would bear with me a moment Chair?    Okay.  Then I have got to go to 448.  I will come back to those references Chair.   Yes please.    Let us go then for the moment to paragraph 29.    You talk there of your suspension by the Minister.  Who replaced you in an acting capacity?    And would you tell the Chair please about how the Werksmans Report came into being?    Alright you fast forwarded in your statement to a significant degree.  We will come back to that.      If we could just follow the sequence in your statement.    Particularly at paragraph 29.  You refer to the Werksman investigation in the record of proceedings before the constitutional court, is that correct?    So if we could go to page 875 please?      Yes Chair.    875.    Yes it is Yb.    Chair there seems to be a problem with the pagination.   That may have been changed.    And I would need to check that.  I will come back to these references in due course.    So I will not go there now.    Yes please.    You take issue in your statement with the compilation and outcome of the Worksmans Report?    And you go in your statement to some detail and to some trouble.    To justify your view.    Of the Worksmans Report and its outcome?    Now I am not sure whether from the point of view of the legal team that that detail is relevant to the bigger issues that you wish to place before the court because or before the Chair rather because they are in a sense your opinion of a written record?    But I do not want to deprive you of the opportunity of telling the Chair what you want to tell the Chair.  Do you have any comment on the division between the detail and the big picture?    Your microphone please.    Right.  Paragraph 30 you talk about communications or attempted communications between Mr Khuba and a person in Minister Nhleko’s office.  Would you tell the Chair about that please?    Alright let us just…    Chair we were to come to that but perhaps it is convenient that it be dealt with now.    Just by way of background you are dealing in your evidence with two separate sets of facts.  The one is the so called “rendition” saga?   Which ultimately led to the termination of services in one form or another of Generals Dramat and Sibiya?    And you are testifying to that set of facts.  You are also testifying to certain facts which led to the termination of service or the suspension of yourself and Messieurs Khuba and Sesoko?    That is a separate set of facts which revolves around what IPID did or did not do in relation to its reports?    And that is separate from the Crime Intelligence investigation, the Crime Intelligence Reports, the NPA and what the NPA did with all the evidence.  It seems that you were called to account for your participation in that chain of investigations and activities regarding the “rendition” saga investigation but those are two separate issues.  The Werksmans Report as I understand it dealt principally with your role and function in relation to the IPID investigation or the IPID participation in the investigation or the IPID part of the investigation into matters related to the “rendition” saga?    The terms of reference appear at page 1375 which is Bundle D.    YD.    13.    75.    They appear in paragraph 5 of page 1375.    Alright.  My apologies Chair.  You have paragraph 2 headed “Introduction”?    And then paragraph 2.1 “Terms of Reference for the Investigation”.    And then in “paragraph 5”.  I am sorry I should have been clearer.    Which reads.    “Your Terms of Reference in the Investigation…”    “…are the following”.    Would you like to put that on record please?    We can and it may be necessary because you have made.    Fairly strong allegations in relation to this report and the signatories to this report deal in some detail with the content of the report.   We may have to go there.    We will consider it as a legal team, but just for the present to fast forward to page 1443.    In essence you have given evidence that further investigation was done and a complete report was signed by yourself and presented to the NPA or the DPP within the NPA.  Do you recall that evidence?    And what Werksmans were asked to investigate and did investigate was essentially the differences between what has been termed the provincial first report and the second report.    And how that came about and whether there was any misconduct in relation to the changes between the first report and the second report and secondly whether there was any criminal conduct in existence in relation to the changes between the first and the second report or the additions.    At paragraph 6.4.5 on page 1443 you are mentioned?    The report concludes   Right.  There may be some other basis but.    It may be necessary to go to some detail into who is right and who is wrong.    In the report.    Whether that affects the other evidence you have given at a higher level is open to debate.    Yes.  Chair in fairness to Werksmans of course it may be necessary to interrogate the whole issue in a little more detail.    But we will come to that.    Yes.    But just at the higher level your evidence relates to a - a matter of general import to the terms of reference of the Commission and that is the manipulation of procedures and processes in order to.    In essence you say in your evidence “Capture the Law Enforcement Agencies”.  At a higher level the Werksmans Report was the basis for criminal charges against you?    What happened to those criminal charges?    Alright.    Yes.  These events eventually also led to your suspension?    Not necessarily the Werksmans Report but the events which Werksmans investigated.    Yes.    [Intervenes].    Yes.  That is why I say.    The events which were dealt with in the Werksmans Report.    In fact led to your suspension although youwere suspended before Werksmans dealt with the issues in their report.    Yes.  No, I understand that.  That is what I am saying.    So Werksmans dealt with certain events.    In their report.  Forget Werksmans for the moment.  Those events led to your suspension.  Are you following – am I making myself clear or am I not making myself clear?    Yes.    Let us just summarise.  You have testified about the “rendition” saga.  You may revert to it in due course.  Correct?   IPID investigated that or was part of an investigation?    The “rendition” saga.  During the course of IPIDs work a so called first report or preliminary report was prepared?    You have explained the circumstances in which a necessity for the preparation of a final report which you signed.  Is that correct?    Whether by way of addition or whether by way of deletion, whether properly or improperly we know that the second report differed from the first report?    Okay.  Let me put it this way.  The second report differed from the first report?    At issue is whether that was done properly and lawfully?    Right.  You have given extensive evidence to explain your view that it was lawfully, properly and necessarily done?    In fact you have gone so far as to say that had the second report not differed from the first report that would have been unlawful andimproper?    Now that is an issue for debate which we may have to go into because there are different views on that.  The investigation resulted in the first and second reports ultimately the facts relevant to that lead not only to criminal charges being brought against you but also to your suspension.  Am I correct?    Right.  Now you have said that in relation to the criminal charges they were withdrawn because you say the prosecutor’s view was that there was no case.  Correct?    Now I am interrogating the suspension aspect, right.  The suspension for the reasons that we have now clarified the suspension was ultimately declared invalid by the Constitutional Court for a number of reasons?    Principally that given the Constitutional independence of IPID the Minister of Police would have had no power to suspend you at all.  Correct?    Right.  Did anybody else then purport to take disciplinary action against you?  In other words did the Minister say then I have been told by the Constitutional Court that I cannot suspend or discipline you but someone else will.  Did anybody else take up the?    The cudgels against you?   Chair indeed that is the plan and that is as itappears in the statement.  My concern was with some potential alteration in the numbering of those.    Next steps that I was going to put.    Particularly to.    Put Dramat in the proper sequence.    But the purpose of this evidence is somewhat difference.    It is - or the purpose of the questions are somewhat different.  It is just at a high level to place the Werksmans Report in its proper context.  In other words to say that even given the Werksmans Report and even given the suspension and laying of criminal charges against Mr McBride they ultimately came to nought.  That is just.    The point I wanted to make.    I understand Chair.    I understand.    But the sole purpose.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    The judgment of Prinsloo J in the matter between Helen Suzman Foundation and the Minister of Police at page 439 in Bundle YB is a useful record of the time sequence in relation to General Dramat    448.   In paragraph 10 the judgment which is a recordal of events and you would know these facts from your own knowledge.  The    Alright.  Just help him out.    448.    Paragraph 10 – it appears that   Are we on the same page?  Apparently not.     Is it correct that the precautionary suspension was at least initiated on 23 December 2014 in respect of General Dramat?     Do you know from all the litigation and your own facts which or firstly whether the Minister relied on any IPID report and if so which?     Do you know whether the Minister relied on the – at all on the signed report or the report signed by you as the final report?     Now there will be direct evidence of this later Mr McBride but would you go to page 490.     Perhaps before we return to the sequence of events I’m going to hop out of that sequence Chair to deal with the notice of suspension about which you’ve asked.     That appears at page 186 of the first bundle in which your statement is, Bundle YA.     186 Chair.     Alright I’m going to ask you because although this is at a level of detail that may or may not affect the general points you are making in your evidence to read it onto the record and to comment on each paragraph that you wish to comment.  I know it’s going to take time Chair but perhaps it’s necessary.     Would you start at paragraph one and dealwith it please.     Right now this is some months this letter is sent, it appears on page 188 on the – or it was signed at least on the 10th of March 15, some months after General Dramat’s precautionary suspension, you see that?     Yes some months after.     Yes so if you could go back please to paragraph two on page 186.     Yes paragraph three.     Right that’s 8 March 2014?     Right if you could go to paragraph five.     Paragraph six.     Right and paragraph seven.     Right now let’s just stop there, what the Minister refers to here is a communication from IPID to Lieutenant General Dramat and Major General Sibiya, was such a communication delivered?     Right and your responded?    Rightly or wrongly for the moment paragraph six, it’s apparent that the Minister was referring to the first report and in a sense relying on the first report.    Yes thank you Chair.    You will bear with us Mr McBride the facts and the sequence of events as related in the various court applications in your statement and in the various annexures are to say the very least very complex.    They involve as we have said two levels of issue one is the purpose of your removal that of Dramat and that of General Sibiya, right and why that occurred and what the outcome was.  And then there is the complex set of facts underlying that.  Unfortunately we have to delve to some extent in those sets of facts so we know that on the 22 December 2014 or thereabouts General Dramat was placed on precautionary suspension?    I am going to come to that in a moment.    Perhaps out of sequence because we fast forwarded now to March 2015 when you were suspended and we are dealing with your suspension letter.      And having glanced at your suspension letter there are a number of allegations made in that letter which do not seem to bear any relationship to the outcome of the Werksmans Report it seems that the issue is dealt with here I am not sure – form the basis of the recommendation and the Werksmans Report which led to the criminal charges.  But be that as it may…   Let us just go through the letter.    In paragraph 7 the suspension letter says and    Culminating in the final report.  Did the Minister speak to you before your suspension and invite you to explain your conduct?    Alright.  Then he refers to the Sunday Times breaking the story or dealing with the leaks.  What is said in paragraph 8 if you could put that on record please?    To put the notice that we dealing with in proper perspective it appears from paragraph 6 that the Minister is saying there is one report which recommends criminal charges against Generals Dramat and Sibiya and there is another one which does not recommend criminal charges and those are two self- standing reports purportedly of equal status.  Your evidence as I understand it is that there was a progression of reporting and investigation ultimately and the final report as you put it effectively exonerated Generals Dramat and Sibiya, is that correct?    Alright.  You also say that any changes in anyreports.    In the progression of reports.    May well have been and in fact were perfectly justified by the results of further investigations?    And you say that that fact has never been given proper consideration?    Alright.    Yes.  I am going to put a timeline before you which has been very usefully prepared for me.    During the break.    Just to put things in a time context to make all the evidence that you give from time to time more understandable but let us stick to the letter of suspension for the moment.    In paragraph 8 the Minister refers to the Sunday Times story breaking about the existence of two IPID reports?    Well I will bear that in mind Chair.    And we will get to the next letter in due coursebut this one sets out a number of reasons that are relevant.    Or not relevant as the case may be.    Or relevant in the sense that they are not relevant.    Yes I understand.    Let us…    Yes to be absolutely clear Chair at page 186 or bundle Ya is a letter addressed to Mr McBride the Executive Director of IPID dated or signed on 10 March 2015 and it is headed Notice of Intention to place you on precautionary suspension with full pay.  We will come to later correspondence later.    But the motivation for the issuing of this notice is what we are dealing with and have been dealing with short adjournment I hope that clarifies it Chair?    Then in paragraph 8 the Minister says   Right.  It reads   Right.    “When you addressed a letter to the Portfolio Committee aforesaid you knew that I had already commissioned Werksmans Attorneys to conduct an investigation on the existence of the aforesaid two IPID reports and your conduct was designed to undermine my authority and oversight responsibility as the Minister of Police.  Further that such actions from your side put the commissioned investigation in jeopardy.” Now one can argue objectively about whether your letter to the Portfolio Committee to give you an opportunity to explain to IPID’s supervisory body certain facts that had emerged in the press is improper interference with the separate investigation.  I do notwant to go into that argument it is on the face of it, it can be dealt with quite simply.  But what do you say about that?    Yes.    In a – put differently what the Ministers appears to be saying in paragraph 8 is that the duty that you have as head of IPID to report to Parliament in terms of the oversight mechanisms and the constitution is somehow suspended because he is conducting a private investigation?    And of course the chorology of the Minister’s attitude is that he is entitled to interfere with that oversight process at his own behest by appointing a firm of private attorneys to conduct an investigation.    But anyway those are arguments we can…   Deal with later.  It is just that there are – those are the various sides of the story the Minister’s side and your side as I understand it.    Yes.    Correct.    And we will come to that in due course.    Perhaps I was unfair to you to say your side of the story.  It is not a story of fact you rely on constitutional provisions and the application by the constitutional court in relation to those provisions.    Then in paragraph 9 he says that – oh and of course what is interesting is that although Werksmans has been appointed to provide a report on the very facts which are the subject matter of this letter this letter pre-dates and the conclusions in this letter pre-dates the issue of the Werksmans report?    In paragraph 9 a different matter is dealt with would you put that on record please?    I am not sure which investigation is being referred to here but perhaps you could explain your response and understanding of what is being said here?    Did he finally participate?   Right so is it correct that you did not grant Mr Khuba permission to meet with the investigators?    And you have given your reasons?    Then paragraph 10 it says   The event described in paragraph 10 is alleged to have taken place during the week of 15 February 2014.  Is that correct?    You were summoned to the office of the Minister together with General Ntlemeza and one other a few days before March 2015 you say?    That is almost a year later.  Am I correct or am I missing something?    Ah, okay.  So.    Alright.  Well that explains my own difficultythere and in any event what is said in paragraph 10 is that it was your intention to tamper with evidence that might incriminate Major General Sibiya, yourself and/or it says Lieutenant General Dramat.  Do you have a response to that allegation?    Your reply to the letter is dated 12 March 2015.  Do you see that?    I do not want to go through the whole of the reply.  It may be that the real issue here is that on whatever basis the suspension was found by the Constitutional Court to be undue interference in the independence of IPID.    That is the more general issue but in paragraph 3.3 of your letter or let us start with paragraph 3.  You summarise your response in paragraph 3 and you refer to the affidavit that you have deposed to in court proceedings to contest the notice of suspension.  Do you see that?    Paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 are general denials of improper acts on your part.    But 3.3 you say   We are looking for it Chair.    Yes.  We could spend a long time debating the merits or demerits of any particular charge or contemplated charge or reason forsuspension.  I just want to return to the point.  Were any of the reasons given in any notice of suspension or in any disciplinary charge or in any allegation in any report or in any finding of any report finally successful in relation to the termination of your services or the prosecution on a criminal basis of you?    Right.  In any event you say in paragraph 3.3   You have been questioned by the Chair in that regard.  You mentioned the Reference Group.    That group had access to and investigated all the documents relevant to the IPID investigation I presume including the docket in the possession of the NPA?    Alright.    Yes, but in any event on proper investigation one could have reference to the contents of the docket and everything is in the docket nothing is concealed in the docket?    So just to summarise that point because it does deal with a lot of these questions at a level of principle and may allow us to spend less time on each and every detail in the report may, I stress may for the present.  We will have to consider the position but in essence what you are saying is IPID collects evidence and provides for the use of the NPA an opinion which is the report on that evidence?    The responsibility for prosecution, the responsibility for assessing the evidence in the docket and the final decision on whether or not to prosecute remains with the NPA?    Alright.  In the following paragraph on page 190 of your response to the notice you deal with the instruction to your subordinates within IPID not to deal with the Minister’s investigation.  Do you see that in paragraph 3.4?    In fact what you say is   So the Minister wants to prevent you from reporting to IPID and your response is well you are not going to cooperate with the Minister’s investigation?    Ultimately you did though?    Yes and ultimately Sesoko and others testified before Werksmans?    Alright.  If we may then deal with what I intended to deal with earlier and my apologies if it is out of sequence and in a moment I will deal with the timeline drawn up in haste but expertly by my junior Chair.  Let us go to page 448 and this is merely a resort of convenience to the summary of facts in the judgment of Prinsloo J relating to Dramat.    The contemplating disciplinary action against General Dramat.   I am sorry Chair.    I am Chair.  It is at page 439 Bundle YB.    It is the second bundle Chair.  It should be.    448.    Well perhaps we should just place this in context and deal with page 439.     I’m not going to go into detail in relation to the application, merely to refer to the facts summarised in that application, about which in any event there will be direct testimony in due course, but this is important for the major points that you wish to make at the higher level.  At page 439 we have the judgment of Prinsloo, J in the matter between the Helen Suzman Foundation (applicant) The Minister of Police, Lt General Dramat, Major General Berning Ntlemeza and the National Commission of the South African Police Service, this was a challenge to the disciplinary proceedings or contemplated disciplinary proceedings against the second respondent, Lt General Anwar Dramat, is that correct?     I just want to go back to paragraph 10 on page 448.  At issue in this particular case, firstly, was the locus standi or the standing of the Helen Suzman Foundation to deal with these issues at all and that’s largely where thejudgment goes but there’s a summary of facts on page 448 and before and after but in paragraph 10, just to remind ourselves, on the 23rd of December the Minister wrote to Dramat informing him that he was placing him on precautionary suspension with full pay and benefits with immediate effect and then there’s reference to the powers under which that is done which we needn’t deal with at the moment but in paragraph 11 the case in summary of Dramat as at the 24th of December 2014 is set out.   He says in a letter addressed to the Minister, amongst other things what is quoted in paragraph 11 of the judgment, he says, “I have for several months reflected very carefully on the issues that have unfolded in front of me, I have consulted my legal representatives and I have  been advised of my legal remedies.  I respectfully point out that the tactical back-pedalling from the initial notice and the current reliance on the Public Service Act and Public Service Regulations and sms handbook is a clear indication to me that no matter what steps I take to defend my position, a decision had already been made from the outset to remove me from my position”. We needn’t go into that background it will be explained in due course but it seems that at various times different statutory powers were relied upon by the Minister.     Paragraph four,  “Having seen our country enter into a democratic phase, I felt that I could contribute in a meaningful way and continue to develop the principles which I fought for and for which I was imprisoned, paragraph five, my appointment as the head of the DPCI, that is the Hawks, I perceived at the time was based on my credentials, my level of expertise and the fact that I respectfully believe that I have always acted with integrity in the manner in which I deal with people and investigations.  Paragraph six, no doubtedly, as it says you are aware that I have recently called for certain case dockets involving very influential persons to be brought or alternatively centralised under one investigating arm and this has clearly caused massive resentment towards me.  Paragraph seven, I can unequivocally point out that I’m not willing to compromise the principles that I’ve always believed in, I am not willing to be agreeable or compliant insofar as I would be acting – I would then be acting contrary to my own moral principles and also contrary the position in which I was appointed.  Paragraph 10.1 the quotes here skip a few paragraphs of  the letter, the so-called Zimbabwean rendition investigation is a smoke screen there are no facts whatsoever that indicate that at any given time I’ve acted illegally or unlawfully, most certainly there has never been any evidence whatsoever that I have in any way interfered with any potential witnesses or attempted to jeopardise the investigation against me during the past few years”. And then he takes issue in the following paragraph...(intervention     Past four years did I say few years.     My apologies past four years, then he reserves his rights, he contests the validity of the notice of precautionary suspension, he then says in paragraph 12, “I am also aware that in the next two months there will be a drive to remove certain investigations that fell under my watch, reallocate certain cases and that, unfortunately, certain sensitive investigations may even be closed down.  This is something that I have to live with”. He then comments again on the investigation into the rendition case and then he says that he wishes to reply to the National Commissioner to approve early retirement and then writes a joint consensus seeking process.  Firstly, did you know of any investigations in which General Dramat had been involved which were of a sensitive nature at the time action was taken against him?     Alright we will refer to another document shortly which deals with that and do you know whether General Dramat ultimately accepted a deal involving early retirement?     Alright, there’s further evidence recorded in the judgement but I’d like, at the moment, to deal with another matter, although it’s a press report it does refer to other correspondence and there will be direct evidence of these facts in due course but it’s important to place them into context now.  So would you go to page 490 please?     There’s an interesting commentary there on matters raised in the opening, the demise of the Scorpions and the comparative performance of the later institution, the Hawks but under the heading “What is the story behind Hawks Chief, Anwar Dramat’s suspension”, the reporter says at the end of paragraph two, “Dramat was investigating high level corruption and was becoming an inconvenience to those with something to hide.  Dramat himself has argued that the accusations of illegal renditions is just cover for his investigations into high level corruption”. There will be evidence in due course as to what General Dramat was investigating but let’s go first to page 491, there is a quote from a Mail & Guardian article which states, in the middle of page 491, In his December 24 letter to Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko following his purported suspension, Dramat wrote “ No doubt you are aware that I have recently called for certain case dockets involving very influential persons to be brought or alternatively centralised under one investigating arm and this has clearly caused massive resentment  towards me. The report continues, new claims have emerged suggesting the controversial security upgrade at President Jacob Zuma’s Nkandla homestead was at the apex of the investigations Dramat perceived as highly sensitive.  AmaBhungane has been told by a source familiar with the matter, that in December 2014 Dramat called for the Nkandla dockets currently under the control of the Divisional Commissioner for detective services Venish Moono? to be transferred to the Hawks.  The South African Police Services never denied this allegation, merely stating that National Commissioner Riah Phiyega and Dramat never discussed the Nkandla investigation.  A Constitutional Court ruling, two weeks earlier made it clear  that Dramat alone has the authority to decide which cases the Hawks should take on.  The source said that following his suspension, Dramat told colleagues that his first notice of the intention to suspend them arrived barely two days after he had asked for the transfer of the Nkandla dockets”. Do you know anything about those facts?    Then there’s reference to the litigation which followed which we needn’t go into now but that is just to place, in context and in sequence the evidence which you have given and which will be given in relation to the rendition saga, the investigation into the rendition saga and the reliance on those investigations to deal with the employment of General Dramat that’s a piece of evidence about which there will be testimony in due course.  Chair if I may then intervene before we return to the statement to place before you, which may be useful, I hope it is a timeline, the notice...(intervention).     Yes we’ll have it typed out and perhaps even by 2 o’clock...(intervention).     It’s not necessary to put it on record or do you want me to put it on record?     Yes sure I understand.     Indeed Chair.     Thank you.    On the 9th of December 20 – oh and by the way this doesn’t purport to be a comprehensive chronology and perhaps it’s a goodidea, Chair to prepare one for you so that all the evidence...(intervention)     Over time would be better understood and placed into a time sequence and context.     But for the present – oh I have a note here which says, I will update and type the timeline, so your mind was read.     On the 9th of December 2014 there occurred the notice of intention to suspend Dramat on the 23rd of December 2014 the notice of suspension of Dramat was actually issued.     Yes two days before Christmas.  On the 23rd of February 2015 Minister Nhleko appointed Werksmans to conduct the investigation.  On the 10th of March 2015 there was a notice of intention to suspend Mr McBride, on the 24th of March 2015 the notice of suspension was actually issued.  On the 31 st of March 2015 Minister Nhleko visited IPID and addressed employees at IPID, we have a record of that, we will deal with that in due course.  On the 17th of April 2015 Mr McBride was interviewed by Werksmans, on the 23rd of April 2015 Mr Khuba was interviewed by Werksmans and the final report of Werksmans was issued on the 24th of April 2015.  Thereafter criminal charges were laid against Mr McBride and on his appearance in court they were withdrawn but that is a chronology that will be expanded on and presented to you.     Yes YA at page 7 Chair, the final event whichI’ve just mentioned to the Chair is dealt with in paragraph 31 to 33 of your statement.     What happened on the 15th of March 2016?     And what were the charges?     You say here that those charges arose out of the recommendations of the Werksmans report, have we got the correct dates here, 15 March 2016 which is almost a year after the Werksmans report was issued.     You say that – well our chronology says that the Werksmans report was issued on the 24th of April 2015.     And you were finally charged on the 15th of March 2016, is there any explanation for that delay, were you in litigation at that stage?     If I can just explain, after Werksmans report was a disciplinary process immediately after so that would be May, maybe first week in May and Charges were laid in May, criminal charges by Minister Nhleko and a officer from the Eastern Cape, Colonel Gwayi? then opened up an enquiry and he was from CATS, Crimes Against The State against myself, Khuba and Sesoko and it was – it took a year for this to be brought to court and during the period -  I just need to mention it so the Commission can understand the invasiveness and the malice attached to what went on.  At the same time, my understanding is that charges were also laid against – I’m specifically looking at timing in 2015 in the, I think it was March or May I’m not sure butin that period I think even within 10 day period was laid against – and it’s out of my purview but it’s – Mr Gordhan at the same time, I’m coming back to the hypothesis which we developed amongst ourselves a consensus of affected people in terms of a timeframe, things had to happen by certain times.  That was our impression and circumstances seemed to bear our suspicions out.  In any event it was a year it took for us to be charge, there was a warrant of arrest issued for us before we had given warning statement and we were asked to give warning statements and to come into the Hawks’ office.  Now I just want to give context which might not see relevance now but what was in our minds. At the same period in which we were asked to come in and give warning statements, it was roundabout the time where I think, the then – Minister Gordhan had said he’s not going to give statements.  So we were asked to come in at that same period but the warrants of arrest were already prepared for us between Mahema and Dr Torie Pretorius, indeed it is Dr Torie Pretorius who took the decision to prosecute us and we were unaware that there were warrants of arrest when we went to provide our warning statements and it could have been a Wednesday or a Thursday just preceding the day of a arrest and we provided the warning statement in the form of all the litigation that’s taken place between myself – ourselves and the Minister and the disciplinaries and the fact that even the Labour Court had – or the Labour Court was seized with the idea of suspending disciplinaries until the Constitutional matter had been resolved if I remember the correct sequence but we gave every document to General – sorry it was then Colonel Khlaba we gave him everything and in the warning statement, one makes provision for the warning statement, we referred to all of that, I think it was four or five lever arch files between myself, Sesoko and Khuba.  So this is the context to understand that there is litigation about these issues and there’s constitutional issues about this.  So be aware of it and the explanations have beendealt with in these various affidavits and you will find them there.  By Sunday, a few days afterwards, in my experience and my view, insufficient time to go through four lever arch files, we were told we must appear on the Monday, that we will be charged and we went to court and we were told to go to the client/customer centre, previously known as the charge office where were charged and put in cells until we appeared in court a few hours later.  So it might seem like a wonderful nice thing to do and normal course of events but we were in essence the  main stay of an independent organisation that exercises investigative oversight over the police of South Africa and this is what was done to us...(intervention).     Can we come back to paragraphs 31 to 33 after the adjournment Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Mr McBride if you could go to paragraph 31 of your statement.      Just to summarise you have told the Chair that you Messrs Sesoko and Khuba were charged with fraud and defeating the ends of justice and you say that that arose out of the recommendations of the Werksmans Report?    Perhaps you could closer to the microphone.      You state your view which you have already told the Chair about in paragraph 32 but perhaps you better – you should place that on record and the relationship in time between the bringing of the charges and the constitutional court hearing.      When were the charges withdrawn please remind us?    Right.  You mentioned that one of the reasons was stated to be that Mr July of Werksmans who had conducted the investigation would not give evidence?    Now I just want to ask for your comment on the one of the reasons given about what you have testified was that Werksmans would not provide evidence.  You have said that – you have already told the court that they had a disclaimer in regard to the use of their report in their report but my question is somewhat different.  The evidence on which Mr July would have relied in order to produce his report and make his recommendations existed quite apart from anything Werksmans did or did not do, is that correct?  In other words if Mr July had given evidence it would have inevitably been of a hearsay nature as to what he was told?    Right.  And all the evidence upon which he relied and on which a criminal court would have to rely existed quite apart from Werksmans itself.  In other words the fact that Mr July of Werksmans did not or would not or could not give evidence would have been irrelevant to whether a successful prosecution could take place or not.  Am I understanding it correctly?    Well except that Werksmans Report was based on evidence or not evidence or the absence of evidence.  What I am saying is whatever Werksmans relied on existed in a docket or in fact somewhere else and its quality could have been judged by any criminal court if it had been worthwhile proceeding with the prosecution?    If we could go back briefly to bundle D.    No it about documents and disclosure of documents.    In regard to confidentiality or non-disclosure of documents generally.    But I can hold that back for the moment.    We will attempt to obtain it.    I will not say that I am not entirely hopeful at this stage but we will report back to you.    Just finally in relation to the criminal charges the prosecutor what unit was he seconded to or …?    The PCLU?    You deal in paragraph 34 and following with the Werksmans Report.  At this stage Mr McBride we need to deal with the report and the reason is not so much for all its detail and content but the fact that you have made certain allegations in relation to Werksmans and those facts therefore need to be explored to the extent that Werksmans may wish to respond to your evidence.  I take it that that will occur during cross-examination and you can deal with it then.  But our concern as a legal team is that your allegations against Werksmans and their answer may not be directly relevant to our terms of reference.  Because what is relevant to our terms of reference is at a much more general level which goes to the general reasons for prosecutions and the like.  So if you would just bear that in mind when we gotthrough your evidence because I certainly do not want to restrict your evidence and we cannot do so but having said that just bear in mind that our terms of reference may not extend to whether you received emails or not and that type of matter.  But there are certain things that need to be put.  Your view is set out in paragraph 34, what is that view?    Right.  So apart from the last sentence what you are saying is that the report was used or misused by the Minister to justify the actions taken by the Minister, is that correct?    In paragraph 35 you say that Nhleko appointed Werksmans to investigate the two reports which he falsely alleged he had been given by IPID.  What is the position there?  And that is the Minister who had alleged he had been given two reports by IPID.  What is your position there?    To whom had that report been given if anyone?    Of the NPA?   Then in paragraph 37 you talk of attempts made…    Perhaps just to deal with that answer if you would go to page 1266.  It is Chair it is in bundle Yc.    Yes Exhibit Yc page 1266.      This is an email from Anthony Mosing of the NPA to Mr Khuba dated the 28 February 2014.  Do you have that?    Sorry 1266.    1266.     It reads   It appears to be…    Alright and it was forwarded later to another party on the 20 May.  And then if you would go to page 1234 please.      That is where this email is referred to where Mr    If the court would – I mean if you would bear with me Chair for a second?    My apologies Chair.  It is the first time in a year.    I think the point that you make or it appears that the point that you make in paragraph 35 if we can move on insofar as it is relevant to our terms of reference anyway.    Yes Chair.    Sorry.      No only that page.    Only that paragraph.    To put that email in context.   If we may return to paragraph 35 then.  Mr McBride I think the point you making is not whether or not two reports existed or who gave the Minister which report it is that the Minister said he had been given two reports by IPID and you appear to say that IPID gave the Minister only one report, is that what the point is?    Right.  And the other report being the first or preliminary report whether the signed or unsigned version or whatever report in sequence must have come from elsewhere?    Well what report was – then I do not understand paragraph 35 and I think we may at odds with each other there.  So let us just clarify.    Insofar as it is necessary to do so.    The point you make in the first sentence is that whichever reports they were two reports were not given by IPID to the Minister.  That is the first point.    No, but I am sorry Mr McBride.  I am getting    So why is the statement that he had been given two reports false?    Yes.    Well I understood it to read and that is what I understand the plain meaning to be that the Minister said he received two reports by – from IPID and you then say IPID only gave the Minister one report.  Is that correct?    Alright.  Then you say the report compiled byKhuba had been given to the NPA.  Which report was that?    Which signed one because there were two reports that were signed?    Alright.  So the report compiled by Khuba we must read that as the report compiled by Khuba - because he compiled both - and signed by all three signatories.  Is that right the final report?    Alright.  My sympathies going out to anyone trying to follow this and it may be entirely the fault of the person who wrote yourstatement down and paragraph 35 or entirely ours for not accurately following the evidence you have given.  It seems that the Chairs ability to grasp after lunch on a Friday is far greater than mine.  Let us take a step back.  Which two reports were Werksmans or was Werksmans directed to investigate?    Right.    Alright.    Yes.    But my question is not what Werksmans thought they were mandated.    To do.  Is as a matter of fact do you know which two reports Werksmans were asked to investigate.    Right.  Now as I understand what you aresaying in paragraph 35 or what has been said on your behalf and I do not wish to point fingers there at anyone.  Nhleko appointed Werksmans to investigate the two reports.  Let us accept the two signed reports.  One signed by Khuba, one signed by three officials of IPID.    Which the Minister falsely alleged he had been given by IPID.  Now you say that the signed report signed by Khuba and the signed report signed by the three officials had not both being given to the Minister by IPID?    And the Minister was incorrect at the very least when he said that that was the case?    Alright.    Right.  So if the two reports that Werksmans was required to investigate which I understand to be the case were firstly the one signed by Khuba and secondly the one signed by the three officials.  Then it is correct what you say he had not received both of those from IPID?    Let us move to the second sentence. “IPID only gave Nhleko one report.” Which report was that in your knowledge?    Right.  The report compiled by Khuba had been given to the NPA.  I take it that that is a reference to what we have referred to as the preliminary report or the report signed by Khuba before you came onto the scene?    Right and that is the only place you say in the last sentence where Nhleko could have obtained that report from?    So we are on the same page.  It took some time, but.    I am perfectly willing to take all the blame for that.  Let us move on to paragraph 36 then.  You say that several attempts were made by July of Werksmans to interview the IPID National Head of Investigations, Mr Sesoko and IPID Lead Investigator, Khuba.  Khuba was contacted by July and Khuba indicated his willingness to cooperate but asked that the request be sent via email and be directed to me.  He also provided the relevant email addresses.  Now you have given added evidence in regard to that.  That it was your instruction that Khuba should not at least at initial stages give evidence to Werksmans?    And you have given your reasons for that.  So what we know from first sentence here is that Mr July made attempts to obtain evidencefrom Sesoko and Khuba but they were directed to go through you and then you make some comments about emails and the addresses of emails.  Again I am not sure whether our terms of reference extend to these details but you have said it and just tell the Chair what you say please.    Thank you.  I have been handed Chair two emails from Werksmans Attorneys but I need to investigate.    Their timing.    And the addresses which I am told are the correct addresses but I am not sure that they are.    So let, let us investigate that and.   I will deal with them later if necessary.    Who was appointed – thank you for that Mr McBride and let me stress what the Chair has stressed.  We do not want to prevent any evidence that you wish to give.  We do want however to concentrate on matters within our terms of reference if that is okay.    Okay.    We will be very grateful to do that.  Paragraph 37 you talk of the person appointed to act as Executive Director in your absence and due to your suspension.  Who was that?    Right and you say in paragraph 38 that in relation to the Werksmans investigation he took certain steps.    Is that correct?    Right and when did you testify or speak to Mr July as part of the investigation in relation to your suspension?    Right and what led you to change your mind?    It was indeed on 17 April according to our timeline.    Chair I have a rough draft.  I do not know whether you wish to have it now.  Perhaps we better prepare it a more final or less unfinal draft.    In any event we know for present purposes at least that Werksmans produced a report and that report was strongly contested by you.  [Intervenes].    Was it also contested by Messieurs Khuba and Sesoko?    Was the report leaked to the Sunday Times?  Do you know or do you suspect?    Are you referring – what transcripts are you referring to?    Of the interview.    With Mr July?    Were steps taking against Messieurs Khuba and Sesoko after the release of the report, the Werksmans Report?    Just to assist you because it is a matter of record paragraph 41.    Of your statement.    Alright.    So the nub of the charges against Khuba and Sesoko were entirely the same or was entirely the same as the charges against you?   Right and we have been to the    Right.     Given the Constitutional independence of IPID and according to your knowledge of the Constitutional Court judgements and the judgements of the High Court that preceded that judgement would it be proper for the Minister of Police to direct that a Executive Director whether acting or otherwise of IPID, dismiss subordinates appointed by the Executive Director?    I’m going to move on to some other matters before we go further in your statement Mr McBride but in paragraph 42...(intervention).      You say in paragraph 42 Mr McBride that – consistently with evidence you’ve given to date that you did not know about the existence of the provisional report that was supposedly altered as it pre-dated your appointment as IPID Executive Director and I’ve added the word provisional just to identify the report, that is correct is it?     Right okay but even if you had known of a firstreport, word document, unsigned, a signed report that had been given to the head PA what difference would that have made?     If after the issuing of the first report or the provisional report by whomever signed even if it had been signed by the then Executive Director, further evidence had come to light which fundamentally altered the recommendation or the opinion in the report, would it have been proper to exclude that and not address it?     Thank you Chair if we may just summarise then, you’ve referred to the circumstances surrounding the production and delivery of the two reports and you’ve given evidence that the first report, the provisional report or the one signed only by Khuba, however we define it that, that report was firstly informed by Criminal – Crime Intelligence Investigations and was delivered under pressure from the NPA both of which would feasibly constitute interference in the work of IPID.     And that evidence is on record and Mr Khuba will confirm it and we will place that evidence before you as well.     The second point that arises by way of summary is it’s one thing to have said to you, Mr McBride you have the first signed report it was in all respects satisfactory, you then went out and fabricated evidence and produced a second report in order to exculpate Messrs. Dramat and Sibiya that would be a different story here that would justifiably require criminal charges.     Yes that’s on record.     In fact what happened between the first and second reports was that you directed an order to complete the investigation that the cell phone records be analysed.     And those cell phone records clearly had some impact on the contents of the final report.     Sorry the analysis had some impact.     In that respect has anyone ever alleged or put to you that, that cell phone record analysis was false or incorrect or questionable in any way?     Had you withheld that cell phone analysis from any final opinion or report given to the NPA would you have been acting properly?     Alright, now there is some talk, finally by way of summary that in the report statements might have been altered to the extent that parts were omitted, you’ve just referred to that now.     Yes now that’s a very important distinction that I’d like to put to you.  If the report had contained a different review of statements in its second version from what had originally existed in the first version of the report wouldthe statements have remained in the docket?     They were unchanged?     And I take it the work of a prosecutor in the NPA who is diligent is not merely to piggy back on the opinion of an investigator but to make an own informed decision based on his or her own reading of the statements.     Alright let’s just move on to another topic if we may and that is in fact...(intervention).    Thank you Chair.  Just to go back a step if we may before we move forward once more.  In paragraph 39 at the top of page 9 of your    If we could just take a step back there please Mr McBride.  It would be one thing if the Sunday Times had a leak report and based their reports on the contents of the Werksmans Report for example and you take issue with the contents of the Werksmans Report so to that extent you would take issue with the content of the Sunday Times.  But what is not clear from paragraph 39 is whether you are saying that the media reported on what they received and what they received by way of information was incorrect or false.  Or whether you are saying they deliberately distorted information and created themselves a fictitious or false narrative.  Do I make – is that clear?    Nuanced.    Yes.    So I understand from your answer Mr McBride two things.  One that we can exclude the Sunday Independent from paragraph 39 of your statement, can we do that?    Right okay.    Alright.  And secondly I do not understand you to be saying that the media deliberately fabricated information and published it but rather they – that they acted in a way that you believe was irresponsible in merely publishing the leaks that they received.  Am I correct?    Maybe you would use a stronger word than irresponsible but – or deliberately mischievous I do not know – I do not want to put words in your mouth but I just want to make that distinction clear.    Okay.    Thank you.  If we could go then to bundle Y or Exhibit Yb please at page 883.  That is a transcript of your interview on the 17 April 15 with Mr July.      Page 883 of Exhibit Yb.    It is right at the end of that bundle Mr McBride.    If you could just identify the document as the transcript?    Right if we could go then to page 886 unless Chair you want me to take it slowly and deal with the preliminary matters.    It is probably appropriate to go directly to 886.    On page 886 would you tell Chair what you said in the fourth paragraph?    Yes.   Alright.  That seems to be the outcome or result of issued that you had raised with Mr July about the failure of communication?    That preceded your interview.    Okay.  If we could go to page 888 please.      Yes.    There you raised with Werksmans the issue that a private law company is investigating a government investigative agency albeit an independent one before the National Prosecuting Authority has made any decision about the relevant matters subject of the report.  Would you just read onto the record what you say there please?    From – then also the fact.   Line 8.    Alright.  As I understand it you were raising with Mr July as you have stated in evidence IPID is an independent body subject to parliamentary oversight?    It is not subject to the executive control of the Minister?    Yet what the Minister has done here he has appointed a private firm of attorneys to investigate IPID and actions of officers of IPID?    Right.  I do not want to take the legalities any further but what is clear from the constitutional court judgment which we will deal with in due course is that the Minister does not have the power to institute or take disciplinary proceedings against the executive director in IPID.    And that is a constitutional matter?    Alright.  Then at the bottom of page 888 you    And then at the bottom of page 889 you say   The second issue was that    “Do not report to Sesoko.”    And we know that Sesoko was the immediatesupervisor of Mr Khuba.     “This is what I was told.” You continue to say.   “Then he was also told and that is presumably Mr Khuba then also told that he must work with the crime intelligence guy and the crime intelligence guy also linked him up with Advocate Mosing.” And then you say in paragraph 1 on page 890 at line 5. “So for me already independence in the investigation was compromised the way it had been said.  In other words bypass the head of investigations those were my issues immediately that was my concern.”    On page 890.    From line 5.    Well line 1 to 10 basically, 1 to 9.    If you would just read that confirm that is what you said and that is what you still told.    Alright.  So by way of background you make it clear to Mr July that when you were briefed you had clear concerns based on facts that have never been disputed as I understand it you had clear concerns about the propriety of the investigation, its competence and its independence?    You also told Mr July at line 10 you say   Let us just pause there a moment.  That rest as it is there r-e-s-t should presumably read arrest?    Or the transcriber might have picked it up but be that as it may that is not an issue of any import.  It is clear that what one is talking about there is arrests.  So you tell Mr July firstly crime intelligence was involved.  Mr Khuba the investigator was told that he must not report to his superior and that he must work with crime intelligence operatives.  And he must work also with Advocate Mosing of the NPA.  On whatever version a direct manipulation and interference with theindependence of IPID?    You say then in line 10. “You were also concerned because it became apparent that crime intelligence operatives were involved in the arrest of the Zimbabweans themselves.”    So insofar as crime intelligence was involved in the investigation they were to put it bluntly investigating themselves?    And some or one or more of the crime intelligence operatives had in fact been arrested, is that correct by Sibiya or am I wrong?    Against that background had you simply said to Mr Khuba, well you may have submitted or not submitted a report I am not sure but there is nothing more we can do?  Would you have been acting independently and properly?  Or how did you regard your duty as to investigate the IPID investigation?    Why did you say that?    Sesoko out?    This is the questioning of Mr Khuba?    Alright.  Let us just summarise there before we hopefully conclude for the day.  Basically you have a number of what on the face of it at least appeared to be genuine concerns about the propriety of the investigation concerning which you have been asked to be briefed?   They involved concerns which seriously impact upon the independence of the investigation and its propriety?    So you go back to square one you say what is happening here?    What crime are we talking about, what are its elements?  And it is on the basis of that that further investigation takes place on specified topics and which ultimately culminates in the report signed by three IPID officials including yourself?    That is the background to your evidence to Mr July.    Alright.  Chair it is well now four o’clock may we adjourn?    I am in your hands Chair.  What I was intending to do was to review our preparation as a legal team in relation to detail and to discuss it with the witness to see whether there is some way..    Of making very sure that we finish on Monday.    So there is preparation time involved but I am    Thank you. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is right.        Yes sir I have.    “Your terms of reference…” This is Minister Nhleko to Werksmans. “…who and under what circumstances was the original report altered or how the second report came about with both reports signed by the same person, Mr Khuba.” And the second one. “Were there any misconduct or offences has been committed and if so by whom?  Whether there is a prima facie evidence of misconduct and criminal liability by Lieutenant Dramat.”    Yes.    Hm.    It is fine.    I have that Chair.    That is correct, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    What the report is saying is because we do not know let us charge all of them.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.    Yes.   Ja.    That alone Chair is a problem.    But the other issues, whether it was changed lawfully or not is irrelevant to them.    Whether not to have changed it.    Would have been a bigger problem.    Is irrelevant to them.    The fact that something was changed.    And from our investigation we cannot see who changed what.    But unwritten word is well we cannot really name McBride here.    Even in our own misunderstanding.   Let us charge them all.    We will cast the net wider.    Even from their own misperceptions.    Which and if you – if you also look at the other recommendations I mean they should not be involving themselves in what the NPA does.    As a private legal company.  What the NPA does and a private legal company does not recommend criminal charges.    To – to state officials whose job is – is to investigate.    So they are – they are double thinking the investigation.  They are questioning the investigation carried out by an independent body whose task it is to investigate with limited knowledge and in strange circumstances where they come onto the scene.  Now I am quite aware that Werksmans is an international company.  It does a lot of good work.  It is well respected and all of that but my view in this instance they got it wrong and they jumped to conclusions and it clearly to me and now we can go into the details it was a hurried report and it appeared there is a timeline and things needed to be done on time and that is why the Minister was even phoning Khuba.  I was on suspension when I offeredto go before that panel of Werksmans and answer questions and the lawyers at Werksmans asked whether I would not require a lawyer and I said I do not need a lawyer.  I have done nothing wrong but the tension in the room was palpable – you could feel.  It was tangible and we based on how we reached the – myself, Khuba and Sesoko we were suspicious the whole Werksmans Report.  This is just a process to ultimately nail us in the end.  So we did go there with apprehension.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    I hear you.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    Chair they were withdrawn as the – and the words ofthe prosecutor were to the effect there is any evidence to say sustain a prosecution.    Why were we charged in the first place?  In addition there is a disclaimer on the Werksmans Report.  The author of the Werksmans Report refused to testify and his view was well it is hearsay of hearsay and I have got a disclaimer saying it is not to be used in any litigation.  So ultimately what was the purpose of the report if it could not be used in litigation and even though there was that disclaimer those who decided they are going for us and they will charge us and discipline us did not care and so it was withdrawn against us?    Hm.    Sir I was suspended before.    The Werksmans interview.    I was on suspension when I did the Werksmans.    Ja.    Ja.    No Chair.  I was suspended before Werksmans Report.    Ja.    Yes.    At the time they were requested to – when they were given this brief I was not yet on suspension.    A month.    Ja.    No Chair except the purported attempt to make contact with me.   Through a defective email.    It came out after the – the interview was in April.    And.    That is correct sir.    And the report was leaked to the newspaper the weekend before I was going to appear in my first disciplinary.    That is correct Chair.  It is – there is a – so I was suspended before an investigation.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes that is right.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Could you kindly repeat the last part?    That is correct.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Indeed Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct, yes.    Hm.    No Chair.  After the Constitutional Court decision the Minister attempted to scupper my return to – to IPID through two ways.  One is the – in fairness – the provisions of the Constitutional Court judgment was such that independence does not mean insolation from accountability.  So to make the whole process fair if there is a case for the Executive Director to answer we will give the Minister and Parliament 30 days – working days – to deal with any disciplinary that is required.  Parliament did not deal with it.  So that is the one issue.  The second issue is the Minister made a complaint or sorry the Executive – Acting Executive Director made a complaint to the Public Service Commission about this matter and other matters in which they then tabled their report of the Public Service Commission to Parliament.  Ultimately that report and its recommendations was withdrawn by the Public Service Commission.    Hm.    That is correct sir.    Sorry Chair I do not – I do not have the correct page.    I have it Chair, thanks.    (No audible reply).    It is 447.   448.    Okay, I have it.  I have it.  I have it now Chair, thanks.    I have it.    Myself Chair.    When I arrived at the office I was made to wait outside and there were two other gentlemen with me.  I could sense they were police but I did not know them.  I did not – had not recognised them and then all three of us were then invited into the Minister’s Office and the Minister’s desk is about a distance away from his, from his board, boardroom table and as he got up he made us sit and wait a while.  In fact coffee was ordered and he carried on there doing whatever he was doing on his table.  Then he got up from his table and started verbally abusing me all the way until he reached the board table and sat down and continued to say anytime you conduct a raid you have to inform me beforehand.  I listened through it all and then when he had finished and he had ventilated enough and he was out of breathe.  I then asked him who these gentlemen were in front of me that you are abusing me in front of and then he momentarily cooled down and said oh I thought you knew each other.  This is General Ntlemeza.  That is my first time meeting General Ntlemeza and we spoke and I explained the circumstances to him of how the device in General Sibiya’s office was taken and I explained to him that it was then handed over to the State Security Agency.  He then seemed to relax and he said myself and General Ntlemeza must worktogether.  So General Ntlemeza gave me his phone number and I exchanged my phone number with him and it was at the period where I think it could have been a Thursday when I met with him and then the Wednesday there was – at Parliament there was a jamming of cellphones.  Then he – as he was putting on his coat he made a joke to me and said I know what you have done with that device that you took from Sibiya’s office.  You went to Parliament and you jammed all the cellphones.  So I had relief.  I though okay it has been resolved.  It is a joke now.  He accepts my explanation.  The next thing was this letter.  So it was – I thought it was okay.  I was actually – I even went back to Mr Sesoko and said I think it is going to be okay now and very soon after maybe two or three days this letter came, ja.    Absolutely Chair.    He did not.  He spoke only the raid and the device in Sibiya’s office.    And he seemed to be happy and satisfied with my explanation.    When he left.    Absolutely.    Yes sir.  That was my distinct impression.    Yes.    That is correct.  I might have the number of days not accurate but it was certainly in terms of sequence of events after the device was taken into possession and before this letter of 10 March.    No sir.   It is – he has made a mistake at paragraph .  It should be 2015.    2014.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    There is no basis for it.  It is – he had got my explanation when I gave him the explanation of the circumstances of taking into custody of this.  I am not sure how would I implicate myself with General Sibiya in anyway.  I was not at IPID when the invest - or ICD when the investigation into “rendition” started.  Communication with General Sibiya was through his lawyers.  I met him in 2014 once on a joint investigation in the company of other people in the boardroom.  So I am not sure – there is no basis for this.  I think that is – paragraph 10.  He was again interfering in any event in the work of IPID.    Chair the person who got up from his chair and moved towards the boardroom table abusing me by the time he reached there and continued is a different person who left the room.  So.    Yes sir.    Yes.    And my impression was that General Ntlemeza hadcomplained taking the, the device.    From General Sibiya’s office because perhaps they had wanted the device.    For some purpose.    But they should have done it and not get General Mdluli’s people to do it.    And they should have provided paperwork like we did.    To take possession of it.  We even signed a receipt when we took the device.    Yes.    Yes Chair because that was the concern from General Sibiya via his lawyer.    That that is - they are concerned about.    That a crime is about to be committed.   It certainly was in no way connected to IPIDs investigation into “rendition”.    Because the final report by February 2015 was already submitted.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.    If memory serves me correctly the affidavit that I had prepared for the High Court was also given to the Minister and that is why it refers to – and also the fact that in the Ministry we had sent an info note on my first week at work as to the status of the report on “rendition”.  So it was my info note that was given to then Minister Mthethwa.  So there would have been in the Ministry that report but in addition I included in my, my application to the High Court which was launched on the same day and if I remember correctly I would have included, I would have included the affidavit to the Minister [intervenes].    Ja.    One of the reasons was that in his letter requesting it a few months before – requesting a document he had referred to preliminary reports and, and final reports.    In his letter.    In November.  I think it could have been 24 November 2014.    And also the fact that we, we attached this letter.  So this letter is I see written there was an attachment to the affidavit.    That is correct sir.    That is absolutely correct.    Because the application.    Was a few hours even simultaneously.    With the letter to the Minister.    There would be and I am just – I cannot remember specifics.    But in the letter in which I am replying to he talks about two reports.    He writes to me asking for two reports.  The info note sent to Minister Mthethwa.    Talks about preliminary and final reports.    And the fact that the investigation is complete but the evidence has been finalised.    Now the Ministry is the Ministry.  It is not the Ministry.    In my understanding.    Yes.    After Nhleko comes.    The practice is and we wrote what we call handover reports.   We prepare for Ministers when it is.    When there is a change of administration.    And there is a new person.  It would have been included in there.    What – this whole saga is to say they existed preliminary or first reports and somehow attached a sinister motive for its existence.    And that is the narrative that has been pushed including through the media.    And that is the narrative we refer to when we make our joint statement that is Dramat, Ivan Pillay and myself.    We talk about this modus operandi of.    Which we explain in here and which occurred in other institutions, anti-corruption institutions.  So ja in essence those would have been the reasons why I would and then would have come to the conclusion he knew.    In any event he had received a report from the Reference Group.   Which we briefed about the final report.    And the communication with Mosing.    And what are they doing in essence Chair is clutching at straws even those straws, the straws do not exist.    So it is make an issue out of something.  So initially he used to write a letter to me about the “Rendition” Report.  Later on he used to tell me about a device that in the course of our operations were taken into possession.    It is now as if they are making it up as they go along.    So, so find the reason.    And, and that is what and it grows.    Later on by the time I do disciplinary there are about eight charges or something if I remember correctly.    So the initial reason which gave me notice of intention to suspend me starts growing as in a very short space of time - two or three months.    Never, never Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    I, I cannot comment on.    What they knew or what they had access to the NPA.    That that is correct.  If I can just add also.  There is also a misunderstanding about how the Criminal Justice System works.  From the Minister and his people because the docket contains the evidence and exhibits and reference to the exhibits.  That is the decision upon which to prosecute or not prosecuterests and they are splitting hairs.  They are trying to find something - and that is my impression anyway.  So, thanks.    Yes.    Ja.    That is that is absolutely correct Chair.    That is my position.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Absolutely.    Yes that is correct.  Regardless of what the opinion.    Of an investigator is.    It is the evidence.    That decides.    As I said earlier very often an investigator has a particular position.    As a final report.    The final report but the NPA does not agree with it.    Or vice versa.  In certain circumstances they say do not prosecute.    The NPA goes ahead and prosecutes.    That is their job.    So to answer your question directly it is the evidence upon which a decision is made.    Not the interpretation, misinterpretation.    Misunderstanding of the value of the evidence.    By an investigator.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    That.    That is correct Chair.    And even to take it further.  If I am incompetent as an investigator then I must get trained not persecuted.  That is really the.    Ja.    Yes.    That is correct sir.    Yes.    I have it sir?    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes, I did in that last sentence. “I remained willing to engage with the Minister in respect of the investigation and specifically to ensure that there are sufficient safeguards to protect IPID.”    That is correct.  We, we were interviewed by Werksmans, Mr Khuba, Mr Sesoko and myself.    Yes sir.    If you regard the unsigned Word document that was sent when he requested as a report then I agree with you but if the one that you had torely on which would bear any weight is one that is signed otherwise it is, it is not a report.  Bearing in mind that reports were toing and froing on email between Khuba and Mosing and sometimes Mosing changed it and sent it back to Khuba.  So the point is as I mentioned to the Chair the issue is the distinction between the signed report which to some extent corresponds to the unsigned one but the unsigned one having no status.    Yes.    I think Chair that is that is why it was put in quotations.  I am sorry I should have gone into greater detail making the distinction, but the report that he relies or could possibly rely on is only a signed one.  That is why we say we do not refer to that one as a report.  We put it in, in quotation marks.  I should have clarified that earlier and that might be the cause of some confusion.    Yes that is correct.    The signed one.    But not signed me and Sesoko.  The one signed by Khuba only.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Sesoko.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Perhaps I caused the confusion with [indistinct].    Chair the Minister received he asked for a preliminary report.    And he received it.    And not the first report.  There is a distinction.    The first report is the one signed by Khuba only.    In January.  So that one was included to the progress report, the preliminary report in the Minister’s language.  So the unsigned one which was on the email is regarded as a preliminary report.  Whereas the Minister relied later on a signed report which to a large extent corresponds to the preliminary report, but it is not identical.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.    That is correct sir, because I had not seen that one yet.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  It is because the Minister asked for a preliminary report and a final report in his letter to me on 24 November 2014.    The fact is Chair is that it was sent.    Because he had requested it.    It had no status but he had requested it.    And, and this is of course November.   2014.    But the one which he then relied on dealing with me on.    Realising that that one has no status.    Someone must have advised him or we responded to it in.    In the media that it is unsigned.    Was the signed one.  So somewhere they had fished a signed one out from.    So his notion even that he was not aware that there existed some preliminaries is not, is not correct.  I think that is the point I was making earlier.    On the preliminary reports, but in our own minds a report that is not signed does not have status, but if it is requested you give it.    And even at the stage where the signed one then surfaced I asked Khuba about it and Khuba said he had forgotten that he had sent asigned one.    That is correct.    That is correct.    But he would not have been correct after.    He started relying on the signed one.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you Chair.    To be fair to everyone I think Werksmans was not sure which one they were busy with.    So by the time Werksmans started interviewing us the signed one had resurfaced which was a status that they as lawyers could place any significance on.  Bearing in mind they are doing an investigation on behalf of the Minister.    To ascertain wrongdoing.  They would not place any reliance on a document that is not signed.    And went to [indistinct].    Ja.    Okay.  Thank you Chair.  In my mind at the stage of them interviewing us they had the, the two signed ones.  One signed by Khuba and one signed by the three of us.    Hm.    Yes, thank you.    Yes.  He was – sorry Chair if I can explain this.    And I am sorry to do this – to go back.  The Chair made a point that the Minister could have thought that is not what he meant.  Then why would he make such a fuss of it right from the beginning.    So, so I am saying it is not only that he had a position on it.  He was clutching at straws and - but the signed one of Khuba only he did not receive from IPID.    That is correct.   The three – the one that was signed by three people.    That is correct sir.    Yes that is correct.    My apologies.    That is correct sir.    Thank you.  Chair the, the point of this is my concerns which I raise in paragraph 34 is amongst others was based on firstly that Werksmans had tried to contact Khuba only and then when he was requested by Khuba to put it in writing and also address it to me the email was sent to Khuba and Sesoko using .gov.za but the one that was sent to me was .co.za and then Sesoko picked up on that and alerted Werksmans and then they resent it and included me except misspelt my name.  Now against the background of what has happened is Dramat is knocked out.  Allegations are turned on us.  The Minister is phoning Khuba directly.  Sandile July is contacting Khuba directly and these problems with receiving the email to me we were under the impression and our impression has not been yet placated if I can put it that way and that was the importance of this and all I can say about this is that perhaps next time that any legal company gets an instruction from a Minister to investigate an investigation of an independent they should be more careful.    Hm.    Chair in the bigger scheme of issues I, I raised what my concern was.    And I risked it.    And I do not take it beyond that.    I just think the issue on the bigger level is private legal companies especially with a good reputation like Werksmans should not easily take upon cases that impinge on the independence of constitution created bodies.  That is all I would say is just to exercise a bit more caution and circumspection.  I will not take it further than that Chair.    That is fine Chair and if I may add at some stage perhaps I will buy Mr July some coffee and we will talk it over.    That was Mr Israel Kgamanyane.    Yes.    Chair just to add that he instructed then Sesoko and Khuba to attend the interview of Werksmans.    It would have been in April.  I think it would have been 17 April I think it is.  I am not 100 percent certain.  So it would have been – to answeryour question after my suspension.    Hm.    Yes.    I, I had a remote or I had the idea that there is a remote possibility that if I speak to them and give them context perhaps the undercurrents and feeling might be lessened and that is why I thought it is important to explain context, time and where different things happened at different stages.  I, I clear did not explain it to them as well as I should have.    That is correct.    That is correct.    It was, it was leaked to the Sunday Times at the stage – we are not sure by who because Sandile July was approach by a journalist to saywhy did you leak the report and he said no he did not.  He gave the report to the Ministry and I remember during the period of the litigation there was some discussion between it.  In any event the report did not include or refer to the transcripts of the conversation with Mr Sesoko.    Of the interview Chair.    Interview of Mr Sesoko.    With Mr July and his team.    Indeed they were suspended.    41.    On 21 May Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko were suspended by Kgamanyane on the instructions of the Minister of Police for allegedly altering the IPIDs Progress Report into “rendition”.    And that that date should be 2014, not 2015.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    Hm.    That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIU:  It has taken a long time to get there but you will forgive me for that Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
