CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning everybody.  Well you will have to switch on your microphone otherwise I will not hear you.      Okay alright.  We deal with the – Mr Gama’s application for leave to cross-examine Mr Todd.  I did have a look at the supplementary affidavit yesterday I am not sure whether it should have been filed but it does say that it was just to err on the side of caution.   Yes you can – you may start.    Ja you can – you can take it that I do not have difficulty with condonation.    Ja.     I will – I will tell you what I am really interested in    I am very interested in whether there are any disputes or fact between mattes dealt with by Mr Todd in respect of which he has personal knowledge and matters that Mr Gama wish to dispute or deny in terms of – in terms of press.  So that is the one thing. The second thing and that is not because it is less important than the first one actually it might be more important. I need you to address me on why I should grant Mr Gama leave to cross-examine that is if there are disputed facts between him and – and Mr Gama – Mr Todd.   Why I should grant him relief in circumstances where he says in his founding affidavit that whether or not he presents himself to give evidence will depend on the outcome of the application.  In other words he is not committing himself to giving evidence before the commission unequivocally and unconditionally but says depending on the outcome of the application and I think he says also depending whether it is desirable that is one of his last paragraphs that is what he says he may then make himself available for – whether to give evidence. Now I would be disinclined to grant leave to any person who says well if you rule against me I will not subject myself to the processes of the commission.  In other words I want to cross-examine other people but I do not want to be questioned.  So I would be disinclined to – to grant such a person leave.  That is my understanding of what he says towards the end of his founding affidavit.  What do you say about that?    Maybe just to be to be sure that you know what I am talking about.  I am referring to paragarph3    Can I take this issue.  Is the position that you are saying definitely there is no intention on his part to make his cooperation with the commission and the giving of evidence that he is supposed to do dependent on whether his application for leave to cross-examine is successful or not that that is not the intention and that is not his position.    Okay.    Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  And then I think the next thing is what the disputed facts are.  You mentioned the issue about fraudster.  Well just deal with the issue of what are the disputed facts or are disputed allegations of facts between the two.    Ja, no, no I will tell – I am not sure that I would need it I would simply look at his founding affidavit.  I would look at Mr Todd’s response and the reply because what the disputed facts are that cross-examination is supposed to resolve should appear from those affidavits.  So – so I struggled a bit as I was reading them but then maybe there is something I did not understand where the disputed facts are.  Okay.    Yes.    Well start – start – start in the founding affidavit if you – if you do not mind.    Ja but…    I will be disinclined to grant leave and then the whole thing gets expanded to issues that really were not made clear in the founding affidavit because I mean the commission has very – has serious constraints on time.  If I grant leave I will want to be sure that it is in respect of clear issues that have been covered in the papers.    Yes but what – what I expect you to do is to start with the founding affidavit and say here are the paragraphs where we raise disputed facts that will be resolved by cross-examination.  Then to the extent that – and then go to the response or answering affidavit to say this is what he says and then if you need to go to the replying affidavit you may go but the founding affidavit is important as a starting point.    Okay do not speak too far away from the microphone otherwise I will not hear you and the record will not have – okay you said 22 to?    I am sorry the starting point must be this is what Mr Todd said in his evidence or in his affidavit that I challenge.    Ja Okay.    Ja. ADV    What did Mr Todd say about that email?    Yes but I want to start …    I am sorry.  I want to start in – in  your client’s founding affidavit what does he say in his founding affidavit Mr Todd said about that affidavit that memo or email that he dispute?  Because when I was reading…    When I was reading the affidavit I will tell you what my challenge was.  I struggled to understand whether the issue was that Mr Gama was saying Mr Todd says I wrote that memo or email or – and I did not write it or whether he was saying Mr Todd accepts that the email was written by – or was drafted by somebody else but for me and I just signed.  So I think when he goes to his replying affidavit he may be using the word created – Mr Gama to say I did not create that memo or email.  So – so – and I tried to look for the email I could not – I could not find it immediately because I wanted to see whether this is a situation where he, the email on the face of it or memo came from him.  It has got his name on but he was simply saying somebody else created it.  It is somebody else’s idea but I just had to – had to be under my name for whatever reason.  Or whether he was saying I was copied on it and that is all that there is to it, you know my connection with it.  So I was struggling.  What is the position as you understand it about that memo or email?    But let us start – let us start with what did Mr Todd say about him and that email.    But what is …    What did he say that you interpret as sensationalising – what did he say about that email and Mr Gama that is seen as sensationalising?    Okay.  Okay I see that in paragraph 22.1 Mr Gama says that Mr Todd said…    I am sorry.      Yes okay alright.  No I say I see that at paragraph 22.1 of Mr Gama’s founding affidavit where he deals with the issue of this email.  He says Mr Todd said he was copied in the email.    So in other words that is what he says Mr Gama said.  Now he – he confirms in the next sentence that he was copied.  So that is common cause.    And he says he was copied since at the time he occupied the position of Chief Executive Officer of    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    But that context …    But that context should have been in the founding affidavit as well is it not so that Mr Cop – Todd could deal with it and the legal team could deal with it properly.    To say in – to say this statement by Mr Todd that I was copied in regard to this email must be seen in the following context and then the context is set out.  And to say that is why we say he was seeking to sensationalise matters.  Yes.     Ja.     H’m.     Ja. ADV     Yes.     H’m?     H’m?     H’m?     Yes but hang on one second.  I think we have dealt with the issue of the email that he says Mr Todd said copied on.  He admits he was copied but he says he sought to sensationalise his evidence. What other allegation of fact is disputed between the two of them?     No, in relation to another point.     So I am not...  Ja, other points ...[intervenes]      Ja, ja.     H’m.     I am sorry.  I am sorry.       Paragraph 23?     Oh, okay.  Yes?     You see, it is going to be more helpful to me if you start telling – if you start by telling me this is the allegation Mr Todd made according to the founding affidavit here on page – paragraph 23 that Mr Gama takes issue with.     Yes, so in other words, what is the allegation made by Mr Todd against Mr Gama in paragraph 23 that Mr Gama takes issue with.     So under paragraph 23, what you are saying to me is that, there is no positive allegation that Mr Gama relies upon which was made by Mr Todd against him but his issue is that Mr Todd did not include in his affidavit or evidence what transpired in the meeting that he held with Mr Brian Molefe.  His issue is the fact that he did not say anything about the content of the discussion.     Ja.     H’m?     Ja.     H’m?     H’m?     But ...[intervenes]      Ja.     H’m?     H’m?     Yes.     Of course, if Mr Todd has said nothing about the content of the discussion and your client has evidence about what transpired, then his evidence would be unchallenged by Mr Todd.     So ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.  Okay alright.       And then, is there another disputed fact between ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Well, if you tell me where they are to be found in the founding affidavit then that would help.     But I remember that you know – I was reading the founding affidavit.  I thought possible too but you say there is a number.  I must have.  So let us identify them in the founding affidavit.     Ja, h’m.     Ja, h’m?     Ja, let us start in the founding affidavit.  Tell me which paragraph you ...[intervenes]      24 what?  What is the allegation it says Mr Todd made against him?     Well, he is not sure ...[intervenes]      He is not sure if Mr Todd makes that allegation but he says in case he does he denies it.  On the face of it, it seems to me that could be dealt with when Mr Gama gives evidence and says, well, if that is what Mr Todd intended to say, and I am not sure he intended to say that, that is not the case.     H’m?     You must remember that the...  In terms of the rules, you know, when I look at an application for leave to cross-examine, I must think of the work of the Commission and the interest of the Commission.   It may be that for a particular individual it might be very important to cross-examine a certain witness but it may well be that it will not advance much the work of the Commission in terms of its Terms of Reference.   It is some point that the individual affected might think it is quite important for him but in the end I must look at the interest of the work of the Commission and that interest right now also takes into account the limited time that we have.   So if I grant leave, I must be satisfied that with the limited time we have, it is really appropriate, important.     H’m.     Okay.  What I will do now.  I mean, obviously, this is quite important for your client.  I propose to limit the time.  Is it fine if I give you ten minutes and I am not going to interrupt you much?   Ten minutes to make all your submissions you want to make.  Is that time fine?     Okay alright.  Let us try and do that.  I just see that it has been over, I think, 40-minutes if I am not mistaken.     Ja.     Okay.     But I have asked you questions.  So that has taken some time as well.     He could have initiated that.  He could have – he was the CEO.  He could have requested it.       Yes.     But that is just a matter of interpretation of the settlement agreement.  Is it not?     No, no.  But the settlement agreement settled the dispute on certain terms and those terms are in the settlement agreement, is it not? ADV     There might be different interpretations of what the agreement means.     That the ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Well, before you sit down.  There is still about three minutes.  One of the things I want to raise with you is this.   That it may well be that I should wait and not make a decision on the cross-examination application and let Mr Gama take the witness stand, give his side of the story so that – and let him be questioned by the evidence leader, as Mr Todd has been questioned, and see whether at the end of that how much is still there that really requires to be resolved by cross-examination because if at the end of his evidence it becomes quite clear that really there is not much in terms of dispute between them, there might be no need.   You might not be pursue the application yourself.      H’m.     [Indistinct] Ja.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.     Adjournment.     Yes.     Yes, yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  Mr Myburgh, is that fine with you.     Okay let us take a five minutes’ adjournment.  Just a five minutes’ adjournment.     Yes, I...  We are back.       H’m?     H’m?     Yes, yes.  No, I think that is good.  So we would defer the application to after he has given evidence and then we can take it from there.     H’m?     H’m?     H’m?     Yes.     Yes.     You say that is an application for?     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, yes.     No, okay that is fine.  I think what we will do is that we will defer this application.  That is one.  Two.  I would think that we then proceed – continue with Mr Molefe’s evidence but at some stage you and Mr Myburgh could approach me about that other issue relating to the Fundudzi report.  At some stage.  Maybe later today or whatever time.  That is what I think or did you want to talk to me now before we continue?     You think so?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes. ADV     Yes.  Okay.  Let us do that then.  Let me adjourn and then the two of you can see me and then we will take it from there.     Otherwise, this application is then deferred to – and will be dealt with at a later stage after Mr Gama has given his evidence.     Ja.     Okay alright.  Okay we will adjourn for seven minutes.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Are we ready to continue with Mr Molefe’s evidence?     Yes, okay, let us continue.  The affirmation you took yesterday, Mr Molefe, will continue to apply today.     Thank you.     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, just some housekeeping.  I do not propose to take another tea break, to take tea break, so I propose that we proceed until one o’clock.     If that is fine with everybody, but if an urgent need does arise people will let me know.     Okay.       We are at bundle?     Bundle 6, okay.     Have you got a copy of the same notes?     To do what?     Oh, you have made notes on the notebook.     Yes, you say the notes are both on the phone and in the notebook.     Same notes?     Yes, okay, then Mr Myburgh is simply saying then if they could have copies of the notes that you are going to use.     Ja, as you going to rely on them in giving evidence.     If you are not going to rely on them obviously you do not have to share them.     Well, Mr Myburgh, do you want to…     At lunchtime.     Well, it is innocuous like that, therefore you would not have any problem even if you were to share it but Mr Myburgh has requested me to allow you to look at them and then around lunchtime – at lunchtime there can be a discussion, there can be a discussion about the use of the notes.     It will be 405 point?     96.     Yes, bundle 5, page 405.1.     I am sorry, you said 105, is that right?  Oh, 405.     Okay, point?     Did you say 405.16?     Oh, okay.     I am sorry, Mr Myburgh?     You have lost me or I have lost you.  405?     Point 7 or 17?     7, oh.       Yes, I have got it.     Yes, I have got it, thank you.     Yes.  Mr Myburgh?     Yes?     Ja.     Well, if he is prepared to share, is there any problem, Mr Myburgh?     Yes.     Ja, initially, yes.     Yes.     Ja.     No, no, no, that is fine.  You do not have copies, you just have notes but you tender them or …[intervenes]     Ja.     Ja, ja, ja.     Ja, ja.     Ja.     No, no, no, I think it is resolved now.     Yes, I think it is resolved.     Well, maybe it will be why – at the time that Mr Myburgh will refer you to those notices, why.  But I think the issue of you using notes is now resolved.  As I understand it, there are no copies readily made available but you are ready if somebody from the legal team, technical team, wishes to make copies then those can be made.       Okay, alright.     Ja.     Yes.   No, I [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes, I do not think there really is a problem.  What he has put to you is a question that says do you know who the transaction advisers are that are referred to in – is paragraph 1.1, Mr Myburgh?     Or paragraph 1?     Ja.  Now it helps to start by saying yes, I know.  If you want to elaborate we can take it from there, but yes I know or no I do not [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Ja, ja, what …[intervenes]     Regiments.     To Regiments.     So you wanted to say …[intervenes]     Ja, you wanted to say it is confusing, I do not know what the answer is.     Ja.  Okay, alright.     Ja.     Ja, before the actual cession.   But the cession referred to …[intervenes]     Ja.     The effective date.     Okay, him say what he said and let us take it from there. ADV MYBURGH     Sorry?     Yes, but let us hear what he says.  He said, because I do not know whether he completed his sentence before Mr Molefe…[intervene]     No, that is fine.  One, if we need to check the record, it can be checked but let us here what Mr Myburgh says he said.     Yes, no Mr Molefe that is fine but remember what I said, I think yesterday, that each witness comes and gives answers to questions that the Evidence Leader is not obliged to, at this age necessarily accept that as true.  He is entitled to probe further, to test it if he thinks it should be tested, as long as you are given a chance to deal with what he puts to you to try and test it.  So he mentioned yesterday, if I recall correctly, that one of the issues as he sees them, in regard to your evidence or your role, will be whether despite the fact that you had a certain relationship with Mr Ajay Gupta or the Gupta family.  The position is that you might not have known of certain things that the Gupta’s and their associates may have done in relation to Transnet or whether you knew, and therefore you may have been complicit, or it was a question of negligence.  And then I think he said, or whether the question is whether they were too smart for you to pick up what they may have been doing.  So when he was putting this to you, he wanted to make sure that as he puts questions as we go further, you know that these are the things his trying to deal with so that you can answer knowing the context, you know.  So that in the end, if I ask him the question when he makes his submissions or presents argument at the end, if I asked the question on this evidence, can it be said that Mr Molefe knew what the Gupta’s or their associates were doing?  He can say, I put these questions to him, or he gave these answers and I did not just accept that I probed further, and these were his answers.   Based on his answers, my submission is that he knew, or my submission that he did not know.  So that is what he is trying to do.     Okay, no that is fine.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, well, let me say this you will have noticed that in terms of the rules of the Commission, there is a rule that says the Evidence Leader is entitled to ask questions to get to the truth of the allegations or the evidence.  So you say he should not be interrogated but what I am sure you agree is that when he gives evidence as it should happen with all witnesses, if the Evidence Leader wishes to probe further, to test the veracity of that evidence, the Evidence Leader should be entitled to do that, as long as Mr Molefe as a witness is given a chance to respond to that, what would not be right is not to give him a chance to respond to it.     Okay, I am sorry, let me deal with one, when I deal with your counsel, let me deal with your counsel, yes.     Yes, no, no.     No, no, I think we all appreciate that we want to make sure there is fairness but we want to make sure that there is proper understanding of what the evidence is and the way it needs to be tested, it is tested, but there must be fairness throughout.  Okay, alright.  Your counsel spoke, Mr Molefe do you - you look like you want to say something.     Ja.     But you understand what I said earlier on about the probing and so on?     Ja, okay, Mr Myburgh.    I am sorry did you say 8385?    Okay.  I have got it.    Treasury?    Not Treasury.    Of course if any service provider says to you please let us revise my remuneration package or let us revise how much you are going to pay me because I have saved you so much.    Before you agree to the revision you would need to satisfy yourself that the statement that they have saved you so much is factually correct.    Yes.  So are you saying that in this particular case you – you did not do that.  You accepted their word or not really?    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes.    You – you did not say to them I guess that flows from your evidence that you accepted their bona fide’s.  You did not say to them you know this is a huge saving you talking about.  Is it R2, something billion?    Yes.  Keep saving please come and show me how that has come about you need to go that far.    Ja.    Ja.    My Myburgh.    Well I understand that answer to be saying you – you do not know as a matter of fact but you were told by somebody you trusted that there were such savings and you accepted that.    Ja.    You say she reported to you at National Treasury?    Yes.     You wanted to be a like a judge.     [laughs]     I am sorry.  You are referring to what paragraph?     Okay.     Just repeat that.     H’m.     Let us just to say 135 at MEM-33.     H’m.     Well, I would imagine that if it...  I would imagine it would depend on what regime you have in the organisation.   You have a regime that says the CFO must have a discussion with his or her staff on matters that must come to you and as the head of that department, he must then give you his view and if he chooses to let you know that there is a view different from his, in his department, he must know he is taking the risk that now that you are told about this other view, you might find it attractive.   And if it is the correct view, I would expect that you would not – you should not be prevented from taking the correct view just because it might... as the head of the department. But another regime might be, you are the head of the department.  You bring to me the outcome of the discussion with your staff.  And that regime might mean, there might be disagreements within his staff but he must take a view and that is the view that comes to the Group CFO.     Would you agree with that?     Collaborative?     Ja.     Ja.     And they did not find each other.     And then you decided    Ja, you did not implement ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes. MR     [Indistinct]      Ja.     No, I understand.     Affidavit.     Oh, ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Consensus.     Okay.       No, that is fine.  Mr Myburgh.     10.6 Directive.     Ja. MR     I thought ...[intervenes]      On Eskom?  Eskom?     H’m.     H’m, h’m. ADV MYBURGH     Well, I just want to say.  It must have been in the other venue where Mr Pretorius would have been leading the evidence of ...[intervenes]      In the Commission.     Ja.     [laughs]  Ja, ja.     Ja.     Yes.  Okay.  I think let us take the lunch break.  We will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS  INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue. ADV     Maybe you could move your mic towards you a little bit.     Okay.     What is the page number?     Oh, okay.     Mr Myburgh, you appear to or sound like you are saying MM each time you …[intervenes]     MEN.     Yes, yes.     Well, I just wanted to say, Mr Molefe, sometimes the drama is necessary so that one has a good picture of how the atmosphere was in that room as something was being discussed.  So I just wanted to say sometimes one needs it, sometimes not.  Okay, alright.     Yes.     Ja, okay.     To prepare, to prepare, rather than to implement, you mean.     You say you have no recollection of having instructed anyone to prepare the memorandum in one day.     Ja, ja.  And I am just mentioning because you said implement in one day so but I am saying prepare in one day.     Oh, okay, as opposed to preparing a memorandum in one day? MR     I thought it was the preparation of the memo …[intervenes]     No, I may be mistaken, I thought it was just the preparation of the memorandum.     Well, I see in paragraph 74 of her affidavit that she talks about (the approval) so the approval was to be in the same day, I think.     Ja, okay.     Ja, well I wanted to say I think his position in relation to the proposal being completed in one day or executed in one day was he could not remember whether he gave such an instruction or not, is that correct?     Ja, okay.     Okay.     Let me just ask this to clarify.  We know that in her affidavit Ms Makgatho says this came – that Mr Singh came to her with this proposal.     Did you get that from her affidavit or from when she was testifying or is the position that when she came to your office she also said that?     That it was Mr Singh who came with the proposal to her but he had said you had given the instruction.     No, but I was – what I wanted to clarify is whether when she spoke to you, Ms Makgatho, in your office, when she came to your office and she was very irate, whether she did mention that it was Mr Singh who gave her the instruction to complete the – or prepare the proposal.     Oh, okay.     Okay, alright.      Do we keep the bundles that we were working with?     That is the Transnet …[intervenes]     And then bundle 5 continues to stay?  Okay, alright.     Okay.       I think it is better to always refer to the bundle, Mr Myburgh [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     129.     Well, let me make sure that I have got the right one because I might not be having the right one.  The one I have on the spine, on the spine is written Transnet Exhibit BB2.1(a).      That is not the one?     Okay, alright.     Ja.     What was the page?      Okay, thank you.  Yes, I believe I have got it now.     Switch on your mic Mr Molefe.     Will somebody please help the witness, so he doesn’t have to stand and look for a file?     It might be better, Mr Myburgh if you just summarised or tell him the gist so that the public can follow, also, when he gives an answer.     Yes.     1283.     Ja, okay.     26.     Page 1285.     Sorry, what do  you think was not necessary, understanding the need for confidentiality or is it something else you’re talking about?     Oh, okay.     Okay.     Mr Molefe, let him finish, Mr Myburgh.     No, I’ve done so before, even yesterday so I protect each one of you from each other.     You can’t divert everything to me.     [Laughter].    Well maybe Mr Myburgh before you continue let me just go back a little bit I wanted to ask something about the fact that Mr Singh presented himself in that memo as the compiler of the memo.    Whereas we have seen other memos where he was recommended.    So the question I wanted to ask you is whether – where a memo that lands on your desk for you to provide approval for something has somebody who has compiled the memo but there is no indication that that person recommends that you should approve.   Whether the compiler is taken as somebody who is recommending or not necessarily he is just a compiler and it means that you have approved if you do approve you have approved without there being anybody recommending approval.    You – you swallowed the last word.    Oh yeah.  You have it or you are looking for it?    Do you want Mr …    Did you say D or E at the end?    A – oh okay.  Okay just continue.    Oh the one with compiler?  The memo?    Oh Mr Volmink’s affidavit.  Mr Myburgh do you want to help Mr Molefe.    Yes I am at 65.    Footnote at 65 yes.    At page 64 footnote 75 you say?    The 2013 version of the PPM applied to the McKinsey confinements.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Okay before you go far I know I think you probably have my question in mind and Mr Myburgh’s question in mind.  What you have just said I think I understand within the context of Mr Myburgh’s question but for me the only question I was asking is whether compiler was taken to be also recommending or not necessarily?    No, no I understand that insofar as you mean.  You did not need to have it recommended by somebody?    I understand that part.    Is that supposed to mean compiler means just compiler and not necessarily that (inaudible).    Yes.    Yes okay.    Okay you could approve without so to speak a recommendation?     Ja okay.    Okay alright.    Prescribed.    1286?    Is that BB2.1.d – not on the spine?  Is that Exhibit…    On the spine what is written?    D for Delta.  Okay.  And then page 1286.    Okay I have got it.  Yes.    Well I am sure Mr Myburgh is going to ask you how.    Confidential of course means …    Only a few – ja only a few people should know about it.    Well if you – I take it that if it is said that certain confinements must be confidential the requirement of confidentiality is there to protect certain interests that is what I am thinking.    Ja.    Hm okay.  Mr Myburgh.    I do not want to disturb you.  I just mention this and Mr Molefe you can say something if you wish to but you do not have to.  It may well be that that requirement of confinement was put in there for Transnet’s benefit.    And not for outsiders because it is the confinement that must be confidential.  So you want to …    Hm.    That is just the confinement.    Ja I understand that part ja.    Well you see I think when you talk about it in that context.    Then the requirement for confidentiality is not necessarily for the benefit of Transnet but it is for the benefit of the person who has got some proprietary rights.    Whereas the proposition I was putting to you earlier was that it may well be that the requirement in Transnet’s policy that there should be certain confinements that are confidential was put in there for the benefit of Transnet not for the benefit of outsiders.    Ja.  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh.    Did you mention the page already or not yet?    Thank you.      Which bundle should we go to?    Oh okay.    Okay.  Okay do (inaudible).    If you – you let us know once we do need to go to any particular bundle.    BB22 can go for now?  I take it can go – can be taken away for now?    Ja.  Okay.  Yes.    It was before?    Oh okay.     A 100 and 21?     Oh, okay.      And the page where we are going, would be?     H’m?     Mr Callard’s one is a different bundle?     It is a different bundle.     Do not speak away from the mic.     In the course of...?     Oh, okay.     Would we ...[intervenes]      Okay?     That they are relevant?     I guess what we should do is.  Have you got copies for the legal team or not really?  Do you have ...[intervenes]      Did you get a chance to have copies made for the legal team or ...[intervenes]      Okay but you can ...[intervenes]      Well, maybe you can make them available to ...[intervenes]      ...to the legal team and they will in due course have a look at them and see what should be made of them.     But ...[intervenes]      If you need to refer to them in your evidence, I am sure that can be dealt with.     Well, it would be important to see if he has got any correspondence to that effect or he can give people’s names, but what I can say is that, for some time knowing that our last pen is limited.  We have been seeking to make sure that we are careful in terms of our – the importance of evidence that witnesses will give, who will come will give. But if there is any correspondence, I am not aware that necessarily anybody has made any decision on that but it may well be that what he is talking about is that he may have been in communication with either some members of the Legal Team or members of the Investigation Team and they have not said they would ...[intervenes]      H’m     H’m.     Somebody from Transnet?     Ja.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m?     Well, all I can say is that, if he has been in communication with the Commission and he believes he has information that would be helpful to the Commission and has supplied any information or has not supplied but would like to supply, he should write to the Secretary or if he wishes to take advantage of the fact that you met each other recently, he gives it to you to give to your lawyers to send to Mr Myburgh whatever information, he may do so. All what I can say is.  There will be people who would have wished to come and testify that will not have the chance to, simply because of the reality of time.   Some of the people, if they had approached us much earlier, they may have been accommodated but others might not be because they may been approaching us late but certainly what we would want to do is look at the information that anybody brings and assess its importance.   As we speak, we are two and a half weeks away from we were supposed to end with oral evidence.  So that – and there are a lot of people ...[intervenes]      ...to try and accommodate.       Well, can we say ...[intervenes]      ...speak to Mr Jiyane.  If he does not mind, then maybe if he can channel whatever documents through your lawyers to Mr Myburgh and then we can take it from there.     Ja.     Yes?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes, okay.  No, thank you.     Okay.     Maybe Mr Myburgh, we could take a break now.  I see we are at four o’clock.  Maybe we could take a break.  Are we still on the understanding that we will continue and see how it goes?  What is your assessment of how much time?     Yes.     No, no.  That is fine.  Do you have an assessment of how long that might be, without saying that I will hold you to that?     Yes.     Okay alright.  I must say that for some reason something tells me that I may have arranged for some evening session this evening but hopefully I did not.  If I did, we will see what the people ...[intervenes]      Ja, when we ...[intervenes]      Yes.       Ja-no, there may be that there is not, you know.  I do not know why I was feeling like we would have that problem.  So we will take the break now and then we will continue and see how it goes.  Okay alright.  Let us take a ten minutes’ break.  I am saying ten minutes.  We are at eighteen minutes past four.  Let us return at quarter past.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Okay, let us continue.    Just remember not to be too far from the mike.      Ja, alright.    I am sorry, I thought you said page 60.  Mr Myburgh?      Maybe this is the wrong file.  I think, is that the memo that on page 60 has the heading methodology of scoring and meetings held, on page 60.  Is that the one?      No, I think I do not think ... let us get, what is the bundle.  Is it Exhibit BB4(f)?    Okay, and what is the page?  If you just tell me the page, not the exhibit number.  Just the page.     Oh, is that so?  I think that is what maybe ...[intervenes]     So it is not sequential.      I am not sure of the file.  Okay, so I must go to behind, after the second divider?    Well, the dividers are numbered.  There is one, two, three, four, five.  So is it the second one?      Okay, let me ... let me see where is, this is the reason why I have been insisting that the ...[intervenes]     The bundle or the divider?    Let me see.      That is why I insisted the pagination should be sequential from the first page of the bundle up to the end, so that when anybody says page so and so, then we all know there will only be one such page.      Oh, okay.  Now I think I, there is a memo here at page 47.  This is page YLRESP047.    Is that the one?    Okay, alright.      Yes, I have got it now.     I have got BB8(b) point 1 and (b) point 2.      Ja.     Of course, of course even if you are talking simply about estimating anything.     There will be parameters.  You say if somebody says what is, what do you estimate what the price will be of that bottle in front of you, if somebody suddenly says a particular figure, everyone will say no, that is just out.  So but if there would be certain amounts, if people give different amounts within a certain range, it is taken that that is reasonable.  You accept that?      Ja.     Ja, but maybe we should not spend too much time on this.  I mean ...[intervenes]     Yes, no what I am saying is it might differ in terms of what you are talking about, but if somebody is going to come and say they estimate that bottle in front of you to cost R20 000-00, you know many people are going to say that is completely out.   Just an empty bottle you know, so it might depend on a number, but if they say maybe R50-00, R20-00 you say maybe that is within a certain range, R5-00, R10-00, but there comes a time when you say but that is too out.     Ja, ja.  Mr Myburgh?    Remember to speak not too far from the mike.    Ja, ja.    I am sorry, Bundle 5 you said?    Yes.      Okay, no I did not realise it is right in front of me.     It has been a long day.  Did you say 22?      Okay.     Was adequate?    Yes.     You might not be having the right one.  The one that Mr Myburgh referred to, does have reference, you might be looking at the wrong one.  I think Mr Molefe had it, I had it and ...[intervenes]     Yes.     Ja, yes.     Apart from the Eskom one ...[intervenes]     I think he also said he got ...[intervenes]     [indistinct – 00   So you might be having one, one of them but not the one he was referring to.      Are we going to go back to PSB any time soon or can I ...[intervenes]     Yes, so they can take it away.      Just for the record, that is Transnet Bundle C and it is at page 177?      117, thank you.     Just repeat that ...[intervenes]    Oh.    Gossip?    Okay.      Do not speak away from the microphone.    Four years you mean you said 2010 – 14.    You said the award was made in 2010.    And this was 2014.    It has been a long day.    Okay no he – he – the question was Mr Molefe after you and Mr Singh had changed the case.    From Mitsui to CSR.    Did you ask Mr Singh – instruct Mr Singh – tell Mr Singh to share that document with Mr Gama and whoever else?    Ja did you do that?  Did you – ja.    Ja.    Are you talking about your power?   Your power to approve without a recommendation?    Okay.    Hm.    I thought Mr Myburgh said Mr Volmink’s point in regard to that was that you only had that power in cases where you are dealing with a confidential confinement.    And not just a normal confinement if I can put it that way.    Ja.    So this – this one – was this one not – is the position that here you were not dealing with confidential confinement?    Ja okay.      Yes.    No, no that is understandable.    Yes.  No that is understandable.  Mr Myburgh.    I think…    I think so or – I think you said you are already exhausted?    So you would like that we adjourn?    Ja.    No I think that is fair enough.      Ja  ja, ja.  Let us talk about what should be the way forward.    Yes, ja.    Yes.  And would your estimate of time be something like what three hours or more?    Ja.    Ja.    Ja. No, no, that is fine I just wanted to have an idea.  Now subject to both Mr Molefe’s availability and his legal team’s availability and whatever arrangements may have – may exist would you propose that we continue with him tomorrow morning or would you propose to go to the next witness give him a break and then he comes back or?    With his evidence yes.    Yes.    Ja    Ja.    Yes.    Ja, ja.  So you would propose that we continue tomorrow morning with Mr Molefe?    Yes.    Yes, no that would be fine from my side.  Would that be fine with you Mr Molefe?    Yes.  Your legal team is fine as well I guess?    You okay.    Yes.    Yes.    No that is fine.  So let us then adjourn and start at ten o’clock tomorrow.  Ja okay alright we will adjourn now and then we will resume tomorrow at ten o’clock in the morning.    We adjourn. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Morning Mr Chair.     Thank you Mr Chair.  So insofar as the application for condonation is concerned I submit with respect at the outset that …     I am indebted Mr Chairperson.      I will then proceed to deal with what I term to be the merits of the application and at the outset I wish to make reference to the opening statement of the legal team of the commission and in particular at    As you please.    Chair I – I submit that there is that possible interpretation If I might address the two questions posed to me by beginning with what Chair poses at the tail end.    I am fully alive Mr Chair to what is contained in that paragraph so it was not necessary for me to consider it as it features in the papers and I can immediately respond. Perhaps to a certain extent it is praised regrettably ineloquently that is my starting point.  There is to be read into that caption nothing whatsoever which suggests that my testimony before this commission is dependent on whether in fact I am granted to leave to cross-examine but I hasten to add this Mr Chair and it is indeed so that my client has been preparing an opening statement and I do not want to make a submission on which I am contradicted at a later stage and I do this purely so as to be cautious in my approach to what I submit to Mr Chair. It is in fact correct that Mr Gama wishes to cause the cross-examination of Mr Todd because he believes and to deal with Mr Chair ’s first question I am going to refer and cite a perfect example of where he is accused by Mr Todd of being a fraudster.  There is a stark dispute of facts in relation to that allegation yet will with respect focus on the GNS contract and what transpired particularly and in essence during the disciplinary hearing of my client before Antrobus SC who was the Chairperson to make such a statement in the context of joining him almost to a conspiracy, a common purpose if you wish with people like Khanye and Senemela and to describe the trio as fraudsters should never have been condoned.  In fact if that was not an absolute allegation then my learned friend Mr Myburgh ought to have corrected it. I will refer in a moment to that but I do not want to dwell that for too long I want to return to the second question if you will permit me Mr Chair? So perhaps ineloquently phrased but it is not conditional only.  The rules do not permit for that and I as Counsel would not permit that situation. So with respect Mr Chair must please not interpret that there is a conditional undertaking to give evidence in these proceedings.   My client is a compellable competent witness as is by the way Mr Todd.  He will comply with the processes and we have already indicated and there is an informal arrangement as to when he will take the stand so to speak. So if that answers the question it is not conditional.  I know I sound repetitive but I want to make the position very clear.  My client would not take that disrespectful stance towards Mr Chairperson and it is not his intention. So I think what he is trying to perhaps illustrate is he would be better positioned to during his evidence refer to certain aspects not necessarily contradictions per se perhaps admissions that are elicited during the cross-examination of Mr Todd if you will permit that and it will permit him as far as he sees it as a lay witness to advance perhaps more eloquently and efficiently his testimony before this commission. Mr Chair if that then addresses the second aspect so…    Absolutely not.    So it would be I repeat it would be disrespectful of him to do so and that is not his intention,.    Mr Chair with respect I will address that issue but before I do so we – we have not having been traded with a copy of the commission’s bundle and I am not pointing fingers I am simply saying I understand that to be protocol so as to enable Mr Chair to follow my reasoning and arguments we have prepared a bundle and with Mr Chair ’s leave I would like to hand that up so that you can follow more easily.  I do not have the page numbering in the commission’s bundle prepared for this application so we have not been able to cross-reference.    Thank you Mr Chair.    So I – my submission with reference to this fraudster issue is to be found in the transcript which is – which is an annexure to his founding papers.    This aspect – this particular aspect is dealt with in an overarching way during – in other words where we say we take issue with how he has presented his evidence for instance that our client is implicated but it does not feature per se in the application it is of overarching nature.      Like…    Very well Mr Chair.  I will then commence with a reference to paragraph 4 and the way I have prepared this is to have regard to the replying affidavit in which we consider not only the founding affidavit by my client but also the answering affidavit deposed to by Mr Todd.  If you will permit me. There is a cross-referencing and I will deal with that.    As you please Mr Chair.  We might as well commence with paragraph – there is a reference to paragraphs 22 to 32 that is from founding affidavit page 10 to say not only…    At paragraphs 22 of the founding affidavit it is responded to by Mr Todd at paragraph 7 of his affidavit and it is then dealt with in the reply at paragraph 3 continue with paragraph 4. Paragraph 22 which does not deal exactly with that first point in issue but it says that he sensationalised and he came before this commission with a motive to implicate him and in certain respects implicate him falsely. It is a denial by our client.  Our client says that there is no merit to this kind of an allegation.  It places the entire context of…    Mr Chair I will then move on from that aspect.    It proves a little challenging because it was not quite how I planned to present this – this application but if we go to the very first aspect then.    He said – Mr Chair he says in para 22.1 of his affidavit Mr Gama states that I sought to sensationalise matters by pointing out that he had been copied in an email which in turn attached a copy of a memorandum from Mr Mtetwa.   He then goes on and he provides an exposition of why he says this is not sensationalism.    (Inaudible)    Mr Chair.    Chair – Mr Chair Mr Gama says he was not the author of that memorandum.    And that is just the point I want to advance before you with respect we should not remove it out of context because what we are saying is sensationalise and sensationalised in this sense that my client was there to influence certain committees and in particular the Risk Committee where Mr Mtetwa ultimately made a submission. We are not privy to what that submission was.  So what is Mr Todd doing?  He is sensationalising.  He does not know…    He does not know.    He is entire evidence if you consider it in context with respect is to suggest that my client had a hand in and was party to influencing the powers that be at the – at the board level, at committee level and that my client was instrumental in that. Now in the ordinary context when one says he was copied in it would suggest at best that the person copied in if he had read and considered the contents to the body of the mail would have acquitted knowledge. But in this context it is something very different.  My client did not have a hand in the creation of that memorandum and in the ordinary course Mr Todd ought to know this protocol requires that memoranda are prepared and seen here as certain perks so the senior person signed off.  That is the context Mr Chair and I want it in cross.    I am not following sorry Mr Chair.    Para – so I am not following you I apologise.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Chair.    It is with respect the same.    However.    We are losing sight of context.  That really is the nub of my client’s complaint in this paragraph and the cause for him wanting to have Mr Todd cross-examined.  And we should never leave – lose sight of the context.    And that is exactly that context that prevailed throughout the various witness statements five of them – five witness statement.    Witness statements.    I think…    I think in the commencement and the fact that our client was served with not only Rule 3.3 Notices and 10.6 Notices which required that to consider this evidence and this is perhaps my answer to that. The fact that he was served with a Rule 3.3 Notice in relation to the testimony of Mr Todd and I want to add this in some instances he was never given that prior period what we term to be reasonable notice that was not there but certainly in the context of the 3.3 Notice that says Todd is going to testify and he is going to implicate.  In that context we say and that is to be found when we deal with these aspects at the commencement of his founding affidavit that is the purpose with which Mr Todd came to testify before this commission and then we say and then he proceeds to sensationalise.  It is all with respect in the context of exactly that.  One should not lose sight of the context which is at the commencement the party is coming and he is going to implicate you.     And by the way, with respect, before I allow that submission to disappear under a mist of obscurity.     He did just that.       Because it all is aimed at one thing Mr Chair and I do not want to reinvent the wheel.       It is all aimed at one thing.       Gama was described as one of the three architects of state capture.     If we consider that allegation alone...     In relation to that point or might I continue with the affidavit?     Oh ...[intervenes]      I am indebted ...[intervenes]      Thank you.     So if we then in turn deal with what is contained at paragraph 42 of the founding affidavit.  It deals with the participation by Mr Todd together with a partner of his at the law firm, Bowmans ...[intervenes]      Paragraph 23 Mr Chair of the founding.     Indeed.     What happens there Mr Chair.  Mr Chair will recall this evidence by Mr Todd where he     What Mr Gama takes issue with ...[intervenes]      He takes issue with the fact that there is no disclosure as to what transpired at that meeting.  Mr Molefe is presently the subject matter of his evidence before the Commission.  We do not know that that aspect has been dealt with.  I do not think it has been raised with him.  So my client is in the dark but this is what we say.   Mr Chair, I hasten to add this.  The purpose, with respect, to cross-examination is not merely to elicit contradictions.  The purpose is to elicit to concessions, particularly, in circumstances where Mr Todd has created a perception.   We want to disturb that inference that may flow from that perception having been created by means of cross-examining him and eliciting certain concessions.  In this instances I am ...[intervenes]      Mr Chair, partly.     That is partly correct.       With respect.  However ...[intervenes]      ...again, I emphasise, the context with in which this evidence was given.     Because you see it is in the context of undue untoward influence.     No rational basis ...[intervenes]      ...the halting of that litigation against     The point, really, is this.       What we later on learn is that there was good reason, there is what we call the Harris Newton Molobatse report that says but here are facts advanced during our investigation which show that there was work performed by Abelose.       So it is in the context of that, that we     Tell us.  You cannot talk about things which we have not seen.  Which we are not a party to in the context, again, of you implicating our client in the so-called undue attempt to stop the litigation.     Mr Chair, he does not have that evidence and this is what we seek to explore in cross because ...[intervenes]      ...if we cross Mr Todd on this point...  Forgive me Mr Chair.     If we cross him on the point and we establish that that at meeting Mr Molefe conveyed to him the reasons why this litigation was halted.  Well, then it flies in the face of his testimony before this Commission, which was that there was no rational basis, at least not to his knowledge, for this litigation to have been haltered.  Mr Chair, that is my respectful submission.     Thank you.     There are number.     There are number Mr Chair.  I do not want to waste your time.     Yes.     Chair...  Mr Chair, it follows.  There is this theme that runs throughout the founding affidavit, with respect.     And it deals with these issues.  And if you just have regard to the very next paragraph that follows.     The one which we just dealt with.  It is again this perception created of this undue influence because you will recall the testimony of Todd...[intervenes]      Paragraph 24.  It says ...[intervenes]      To the...  I quote    And ...[intervenes]      Mr Chair, with the greatest of respect to the Commission.       The purpose of cross-examination, again, is ...[intervenes]      Mr Chair, I fully appreciate that.     But I simply want to make this one response.  It serves – it will not serve this Commission’s interests to have two competing versions in circumstances that neither of them or at least not that of Mr Todd’s has been tested under cross but I get – I fully appreciate the sentiment expressed and I respect that.   Mr Chair, so we go – we go further, paragraph 24 and again the context within which there is reference to it and there are two separate memorandums here, but again and just so that we do not waste time, it is said in the context of my client having had a hand in this so-called undue influence.   I want to cross-examine Mr Todd.  I want to ask him where is your evidence for this because you did not disclose it then.  He says things, like, my client took certain steps.  What were they?   You cannot give evidence-in-chief, as I term it, without making a full disclosure.  With respect, we ought to be able to test that version.       I am a long distance runner with a long breath but I am going to do my level best Mr Chair.     As you please.     Thank you.     Mr Chair ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Mr Chair, I am going to commence then by doing that, by having regard to paragraph 25.  It is an aspect that deals with condonation.  You will recall the testimony of Mr Todd, how he told you that he could not see, as though he was an expert witness, he could not see how condonation influenced the process.     My understanding of the process and the protocols works, you must be given leave to apply for condonation.  It is common cause that he was not give leave to apply.   And what is particularly of significance Mr Chair, that aspect, it would appear, is something that persuaded not only the chairperson of the board in the form of Mr Mkwanazi but also the board as a whole with one or two disciplines, to then find that the interest of justice, the probabilities – and we have regard to the Morton Rose     ...do not permit me to dwell too much on that aspect.  We have paragraph 26 of my founding affidavit  It refers to the report by the Deneys Reitz Attorneys and it is very important that I simply tell you what this report says Mr Chair.   That there is a probability, not possibility as Mr Todd contended for, but probability and we know in law that the one has more prospects of happening than the other. The probability that the bargaining council or the court considering the appropriateness of the sanction of dismissal of Mr Gama may reach the conclusion that dismissal was not appropriate having regard to the challenging sanction advanced by him.  That instance, the court may either award compensation to Gama or find a lesser sanction ought to have been imposed and therefore... reinstate him. It is not a thought there is no reason, no motivation, no rationale for his reinstatement.  To instruct a firm, a well-respected firm of attorneys, one of the biggest in the country, to give you an opinion and that opinion leads to this conclusion.  Just like Mr Todd is a partner of one of the biggest law firms in this country, so was Denys Reitz prior to it being incorporated into Norton Rose.   They sought the opinion, they received it.  Whether we sit today, and as Mr Todd did, he is not an expert witness and this is the crux of my submission.  He comes before you, with respect Mr Chair, and he wants to sit and interpret.  He was not a party to the negotiations.  He was not a party to the advice sought and obtained. You do not come and give this sensationalised     That is his interpretation Chair.     Yes, yes.     This is our submission.  I am not a commercial lawyer but I can say this.  The little knowledge I have of commercial work is there is a thing that when you interpret the conduct of parties, which is contract by conduct, the conduct we have, Eskom paid.  I beg your pardon.  I am also seized there with the...  Transnet paid.   Mr Chair, but this is important for your purposes.  That one million and sixteen thousand rands payment which Todd tells you.  It is bizarre.  There is no cause.  Let me tell you Mr Chair.  It is not true.   That payment, following the high court order where my client lost his application in his bid to stop the proceedings, that was a payment which my client made, by the way.   And when the settlement agreement was concluded that money was paid back to him but I am going to continue with the affidavit.     Mr Chair, I think, and I say this with respect, that is a very wise proposal by Mr Chair as to the future conduct of in particular this application is concerned.     But Mr Chair will appreciate, no doubt, that I am creature of instruction and ...[intervenes]      ...if you permit me in circumstances where I can say to this Commission ...[intervenes]      ...my client feels very strongly about this application.     If I am permitted a very short adjournment ...[intervenes]      A few minutes ...[intervenes]      ...to canvass this issue.     It would be naughty of me not to do so.     And return to a concession in that regard.     If you permit me that opportunity.     It may be a wise approach to the matter.     Might we take that short ...[intervenes]      ...adjournment so that I can consider it because I am not anywhere near conclusion.     But I do understand that there are time constraints.     Thank you Mr Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS FOR A SHORT BREAK INQUIRY RESUMES AFTER SHORT BREAK     Mr Chair, we have taken instructions.     We concur with the view expressed by Mr Chair.     And then we propose that there not be an ultimate termination of this application until such time as you have suggested.     There is, and I do not want to appear to be opportunistic.     There is potentially an application of sorts concerning the evidence of Mr Gama, particularly, as it pertains to the Fundudzi report.     But it is something that I have discussed with Mr Myburgh.     And the suggestion very early this morning, as discussed between, was that we approach you in chambers ...[intervenes]      ...for that purpose.     And I am simply requesting that we be granted that opportunity.  We will be very brief.     It depends in part.  The relief is two-fold.  One that Mr Gama not be interrogated concerning the Fundudzi report.     But that he continues with his testimony.     And that at a later stage he will be given an opportunity to deal with the Fundudzi report and he may for that purpose be recalled upon receipt of a further supplementary affidavit from him.  I make this submission before your Mr Chair in the context of this application will also be held over until that final termination.     As it were.     There is a measure of urgency to what I want to discuss ...[intervenes]      ...in the sense that if there is no compromise ...[intervenes]      ...we are going to serve our application and I do not want to do that because ...[intervenes]      ...it is going to lead a whole new set of consequences.     So if we could.     If Mr Chair will indulge us for a few minutes now.      I am indebted.     As you please Mr Chair.     Thank you. 
OLDWADGE: Which is paragraph 23. Sorry paragraph 22 of the founding affidavit and it is referred to in paragraph 10 of Todd’s affidavit and then in paragraph 4 of the replying affidavit.  What we say in paragraph per the   Through much speculation and conjecture through sensationalism and as I will demonstrate later if time permits me to do so with evidence that is not factually correct.  So we say with respect Mr Chair.  I have regard to what Rule 8.3 says.   All I want to advance before Mr Chair is that this Commission will be in a better position to determine where the truth lies, particularly, when you have regard to paragraph 22.1 when it says...  Well, it is sensationalised in the context of him coming to implicate me.   I, by no means – I am not ...[intervenes]    We would really, respectfully, appreciate that approach. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   [No audible reply] [Microphone not switched on.     I am talking about at the time Mr Molefe?     Could you please just answer my question.     Fair enough.     So then, at paragraph 1.2, it says    I think we understand that content.     So sub-three    Sub-four    Sub-five    Then if we go through the background…[intervene]     Certainly.     Then we get although, as I understand you to be saying at the time, you did not know of the agreements and the background.     Alright and then if we go to the     So that is how things started.      That I think we have we have gone through yesterday.     Three    Four    Five    Six    Yes, no absolutely.    “But the entire scope of the  engagement was allocated to Regiments, with McKinsey only responsible for the business case and limited technical optimisation aspects.”     So then, what I want to do is to take up please to paragraph 10 and that you find at page     It talks here under the heading value created by transaction advisor and then it deals with Regiments.     “Regiments assisted Transnet in  computing the effects of hedging and escalation based on the original delivery schedule, compared to an accelerated scope revised delivery schedule. As well as optimising the foreign exchange hedging and guaranteed bond pricing.”     11    If you could then drop down to paragraph 13, it deals with the allocation of locomotives dealt with in the previous paragraph.  “This allocation resulted in an increase in the cost per locomotive due to bidders having to allocate more of the overhead cost to a smaller batch.”     And then you say at 17 or it is     And then if you drop down to     And then under the heading triple     So that is no doubt why it was brought to you by Mr Singh.      And it was really on that basis that the contract value increased from R51million to R119million.      Through this additional payment of R78million.     Okay, then the budget implications.     No then I think that you and then see eye to eye on this. I mean, effectively, the change in remuneration model, you are right, the original model would not have allowed this, but you reflected on the saving, and you agreed to change the model, and therefore agreed to pay them the R78million for R2.8billion. But and we are going to come to the technical aspects and of course, you did not have to do this.     But that was not the original model and have a look at paragraph 22…[intervene]     If I can just ask you to go to paragraph 22, just so that we understand and I will then     And you accept that you did not have to do that it was quite generous.     So it was generous of you.     Yes, but I am saying it was generous of you.  I mean, you could have said, I am just holding you to the comment there was no - Mr Molefe there was nothing in law that was compelling you to do this.     Alright, well, do you know what happened to half of this money?     No, you do.     You do know what happened to half of the money Mr Molefe, that is the issue.     Well, it was paid to Mr Essa.      You see, that is why this is placed under scrutiny because you I think, have accepted that this was generous.  You did not have to in law do this, you decided for business reasons to do it on your own.     And what is the answer to that?     But I think that that as you know is…[intervene]     Because now you want to think, you want to say that I was paying R78million or half of it to Mr Essa and that is not true, I deny that in the strongest possible terms.      I understand that but what you can understand why this contract is being placed under scrutiny, and of course, whether or not you knew what Mr Essa was up to you really needs to be decided when it has gone through all the facts one cannot deal with it now.     But we have been through that Mr Molefe, you did not know him but you had a seat at the table at the Gupta’s…[intervene]     And they were the beneficiaries of this money laundering, he was their money laundering, Lieutenant you knew them that is the problem.      I said, you knew…[intervene]     Let me just retrace my steps if you do not mind.     Mr Molefe, I was trying to explain in fairness to you why one needs to from the Commission’s perspective, place this memorandum under scrutiny, just bear with me.     No, that is not what I said.     I said…[intervene]     Well, I would really like to cut through this, I mean, as far as you concerned, you did not know.     Alright, and what I was trying to get at is when I referred to Mr Essa, you said you did not know him.  I then pointed out to you that you actually knew the Gupta’s, that is where I am going to, but if you say you did not know this, that answer must be accepted, now, let us move on from this document.  But I am going to come back to the issue, ultimately and I told you right up front, that ultimately whether you knew or not, and I am sure you must accept, must be determined once one's gone through all of the evidence, and then you look back on it, not one single thing would be determinative of that question.     Thank you, Mr Molefe could I ask you please to go to the MNS Report, bundle 6, exhibit BB27 and could you please turn to page…[intervene]     385.    It says and I direct your attention towards the foot of the page paragraph 2.5.9.    Surprisingly on 16 April 2014 Mr Singh wrote a memorandum to Mr Molefe to approve a change in the remuneration model of Regiments and that Transnet pay Regiments an amount of R78 million.  You see that?    We dealt with that.      385.    Mr Molefe I suppose there is one thing I have not finalised.    No I am going to come to that if I could just ask you to confirm.  You signed the memorandum you received from Mr Singh the next day?    On the 17t h of April.    Yes do you want to comment on 259?    Yes sure.    What MNS then do at paragraph 2.5.10 and 2.5.11 is they essentially summarised the memorandum we need not deal with that.    But could I ask you please then to go to 2.5.13 you have confirmed that on the 17t h you approved that request.    Correct?  And then what they refer to is a memorandum from Mr Edward Thomas.  Do you know who he was?    I understand that at a time he was the Chief Procurement Officer.    Might he have been?    And it talks about a memorandum of his dated the 23 rd of April and this is what he said at paragraph 11 from the memo. “The benefits that Transnet obtained from the transaction although is a contract was as a result of the contracted or deliverables being provided in terms of the current fixed fee agreement Transnet has with the service provider.    So in other words he is saying well that is what you contracted for.    And then goes on to say   I am coming to that now Mr Molefe. MR    And I was going to come to that Mr Molefe.    Why – Why?    So let us – no of course not but let us first deal with the sentiment expressed.  I am so – I accept it records you did not get it but I…    Alright.    But what about the proposition that I want to put to you that it was part of the deliverables that they had contracted for.  That is what he is saying.    Yes. MR    Right.  If I then take you to the next paragraph and you are quite right in an interview with Mr Thomas he confirmed that he had drafted a memorandum to Mr Gary Peter objecting to Regiments payment on a risk shared basis however Mr Thomas could not confirm whether Mr Peter shared the memorandum with Mr Singh or Mr Molefe.  As I understand your evidence.    Alright.  And what is your view of that now seeing this – seeing the concern that he raised?    Alright.    Who was – what position did Mr Peter occupy at this time?    And if Mr Thomas had written this memorandum to him would you have expected Mr Peter to provide you with the memorandum?    Right.  I am not sure who was it that it was addressed to?    I beg your pardon?    I can find out for you.    On the reading of it it seems to me it was addressed to Mr Peter.    So as I understand what your evidence is is that if it was one of those multilevel.    Memos it would have got to you but otherwise as I understand your evidence correct me if I am wrong it would have been up to Mr Peter to decide that.    Alright.  And then if we just carry on there is just I think two other points I want to look at.  2.5.16 on 24 April 2014 Transnet and Regiments concluded the first addendum to the MSA which provided for a fixed fee of the R78 million.  Correct?    Yes.    Yes.  And what we do know…    Yes.    Alright. Well it is those very points that you raised that obviously also things that concern the commission but we need not go through all of that.  If I could just direct your attention to paragraph 2.5 18 or just ask you to confirm that on the 30t h of April Regiments was then paid the R79 million.    And you might then have seen at paragraph 2.5.20 that MNS having investigated the matter found that there were in fact no savings that Regiments secured for Transnet.      Thank you.  Just so that I understand it when you say you trusted your colleagues it was – are you referring here to Mr Singh?    I mean there was no one else.    Did you when you received this memorandum did you engage with Mr Singh?    You may have?    In the process of doing that did he indicate to you when the McKinsey MSA was signed.    And there was a session.    Did he bring all that to your attention?    So let us go back to the MNS memo and just I do not know if you know this.  You know that Mr Sedumeni you know the author of this – when I say memo the report has testified in the commission.    Mr Sedumeni.    Ja you know that he has testified?    Alright.    Aright.  If we go back to paragraph 2.5.20 there were no savings that Regiment secured with Transnet in that one.  JP Morgan hedged the financial risk which Regiment purports it arrived.  A significant savings for Transnet too.  Idea to transfer the FX risk to the balance sheet of the surprise came from Transnet and not Regiments and three the performance guarantees did not result in savings due to the small amounts used and the majority of the bonds were market related.  I – as I understand it you say you did not – none of it.  Or perhaps I could just ask you to comment on that?    You, yourself do not know whether that saving was effected as I understand your evidence.    It was told to you yes.    Well I just wanted to ask you I mean you see that on this memorandum there are not various levels of authority and Mr Singh is writing directly to you.    Is that right?    And what was my understanding of you evidence correct that you did not ever have an occasion to question Mr Singh’s trustworthiness?    So we started out yesterday dealing with the procurement of consulting and advisory services and so far what we have been dealing with really is the 1064 revisory contract.    I want to change to another topic albeit related but it the next contract that I want to look at and that is the China Development Bank loan.    Now let me perhaps just summarise Mr Molefe the – the – some of the evidence that I can get you to the point where you and I can engage one another about what I would like to ask.   What the evidence shows is that after the 1064 locomotive contract was awarded to the four OME’s Transnet of course knew this.    Oh yes I beg your pardon.  Transnet needed to secure funding for this about R50 billion expenditure.    And the two Chinese bidders CSR and CNR they had included letters of funding support from the Chinese Development Bank and that is what brings me to this topic.      Now Ms Makgatho she was –     Makgatho.    She was your head of Treasury is that right?    She gave evidence about a trip that she took to Beijing with Mr Singh in July of 2014 to meet the Chinese Development Bank and she went on to testify that upon her return from Europe where she did some international travelling there at the end of July 2014 her evidence was that she was shocked to find out that Regiments were – were on the scene and negotiating with China Development Bank.    That is the rough background.    No when she came back.    And that then brings us to the 4t h of August 2014 when she sent you a memorandum.    Setting out her concerns.    Perhaps I could take you to that memorandum and let me take you please to – just give me a second?  Could I ask you please to fish out Exhibit BB10(a)?    Could I ask you please to turn to page 31 NEM31?      So at paragraph 126 she talks about returning from Europe and she was shocked to find out that the CDB was now communicating directly with Regiments and that Eric Wood was leading the negotiations.  And this was in parallel to Transnet furthering negotiations with the CBD.  I just want to then take you to paragraph 127 over the page.    She said   And do you accept that you received that email from her on the 4t h of August?    Right.  She goes onto say in her affidavit at paragraph 131 this is at page MEM33.    That you organised a meeting between Transnet and Regiments to resolve the CDB pricing proposal impasse and that meeting was held she says at the Melrose Arch Hotel.  Transnet was represented by Mr Singh and yourself and herself and Regiments by Eric Wood and Niven Pillay.  You confirm that?    She says that   Do you want to comment on that?    You stuck in the middle did you say?    Oh I beg your pardon.     Alright.  And then, what we know at paragraph 133 is that after that Melrose Arch meeting, she then sent you ...[intervenes]      Paragraph 133.     At MM...  Sorry, MEM-33.  Are you there Mr Molefe?     She said she sent you a further email.  Perhaps you can go to that?     That is page 240.     I am not going to take you through this but she put forward her position in some detail, correct?     And in fact, in the first introductory paragraph after “I trust that you are well...”, et cetera.  It     ...Once-off Arrangement fee.  Which, of course, there was a fee to be paid for this.  That fee would go to Regiments.  And then under the heading     “...may be classified as PFMA violation given the information...”  So that was her view.     There was another view held by Mr Singh, as you have said.       Alright.  And then, if you have a look at paragraph 135.  It reflects that Mr Singh then writes a memorandum in response. Can I ask you to just ...[intervenes]      Yes, thank you Chairperson.     That memorandum you will find at MEM-285.  Could you go there, please?     258, yes.     And this – I would ask you to confirm, is Mr Singh’s response, correct?     He puts forward his case.  And if you go to MEM-297 ...[intervenes]      ...you will see that what he asks you     Yes.     That is why you noted it.     Right.     So if you go to paragraph 136 at page MEM-33.     You will see there at the foot of the     Thank you.  Mr Molefe, that I think takes us to the 28 t h of August 2014 when you noted the memo.  So you have got these two conflicting views.     What we do know is that an agreement was concluded with China Development Bank on the 4 t h of June 2015 but by this time, as I just ask you to confirm, you had been seconded to Eskom.  Is that correct?     And ...[intervenes]      I will ask you if you go, please, to page MEM-34?     Ms Makgatho then carries on with the chronology.  She talks about a presentation made by a Mr Singh.  And then at paragraph 140, over the page, at     Yes.     But as you say, you never, in the course of your term, put a stop to the potential Regiment’s ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Alright.     So Mr Molefe, you have read, no doubt, that Regiments were paid 166 million as success fee for securing the CBD funding facility and their advice to split the capital raising between CBD and the so-called ...[intervenes]      Have you read about the fact that they have got ...[intervenes]      the success fee?  Yes?  Have you read about that?     Yes.  And certainly, on the money finances, half of that money would have found its way into a process of money laundering but as I understand it, your case is that you do not know about it.     Alright.     Mr Mohammed ...[intervenes]      ...in addition to this, Makgatho also gave evidence about this loan.     And his evidence was to the effect that Treasury had sufficient expertise to enter into the loan transaction.  He was of the view that there was no need for external support and that there was no need for the loan agreement fees to have been incurred.     Arrangement fees.     Do you recall that evidence?     Do you want to comment on that?     So can I just ask you.  Do you agree or disagree with the – Mr Mohammedi’s view that he gave here before the Commission?     Well, it was simply that there was no need to incur the loan arrangement fees paid to Regiments.     Alright.     Alright.  And perhaps just to conclude this, I will just put to you what he said in evidence that he gave on Day 93 and this you will find at page 144 of the transcript.     Yes.     And you feel comfortable saying that despite the fact that this was an agreement concluded after your time?     What you have just said about Mr Mohammedi.     Oh, I see.     Just so that I understand it.  You were issued with a lot of 3.3. Notices ...[intervenes]      ...in this case, correct?     And never once did you exercise a right, your right to put in a statement deposing what people said, correct?     And never once did you exercise your right to cross-examine anybody, correct?     You can go ahead Mr Molefe.     So ...[intervenes]      So do I understand you to be saying, as you sit here now, that you do not feel that you have been implicated at all in any wrongdoing?  It is different between guilty of wrongdoing.  Is your sense that you have not even been implicated in wrongdoing by ...[intervenes]  MR     Well, you have received all the 3.3’s.     Mr Chairperson, I see that it is one o’clock.  If this is a convenient time.     I think put differently it is the last form in file insofar as that might help.    Your registrar.        PSV1283.     Thank you.  Mr Molefe do you have page 1283?       Alright so this is the ...[intervenes]      So, this is the – my shorthand, the coal confinement, is that right?     And I just want  to take you to page1289, it’s recommended that the Group Executive approve sub (1) the resourcing strategy and remuneration model for the coal line and then (2) confine and award services for support to the internal team, to McKinsey & Company and its BEE consortium partners, you signed off on that, correct?      And then – that’s just for the sake of the record, because I understand that none of this is an issue unless you tell me differently.  Will you please, then turn to the second confinement, PSV1291.     And of course, on each of these confinements you set out your grounds for confinement, that we see as we page through, at the end of this is 1297 and you approved, again, confine and award services or support to the internal team to McKinsey & Company and its BEE consortium partners, correct?     Proposed by Mr Singh, like the previous time.     Or compiled by Mr Singh, I suppose is the correct word.     And approved by you.     Then, if I can ask you please to go to page PSV1299, is the Manganese confinement, if I could ask you to fast forward to page PSV1305 and there’s you’ll see similarly at 40.2, confining and awarding the service to support the internal team to McKinsey & Company and its BEE consortium.     That, we see you approved on the 3 r d of April 2014, correct?     And then the last contract or the last confinement the NMPP, that you find at PSV1307.     If you would then go to the end of that contract or that confinement rather you find that at 1313, it’s the same language at paragraph 41.2, confine, and award services for support to the internal team to McKinsey & Company and its BEE consortium partners approved by you, again, on the 3 r d of April 2014, is that right?     Now, just by way of contrast could I ask you – and we may come back to this, to go to page 1273, this is a different contract, it’s not amongst the four that I’m dealing with now, it’s a different confinement rather, I beg your pardon, it deals with capital optimisation and implementation support, do you see that?     PSV1273, are you there?     Just by way of contrast if I could ask you to go to page 1280, you’ll see that this has various levels of recommendation. There you have Mr Mahomedy, Mr Pita, Mr Singh, Mr Molefe and also – then recommended separately, it seems by Mr Volmink, do you see there?     What I’m saying to you is, here the various levels of authority and recommendation whereas in respect of the four confinements that I’ve taken you to, there we see compiled by Mr Singh and approved by you.     Well, it’s a different – and my language is wrong, you’re right it’s a different approval mechanism?     Okay, now, Mr Volmink gave evidence about these four confinements that you approved,  could I ask you please to go to Exhibit BB2.1 and you can, perhaps leave that file open.  I want to take you to a different  Exhibit, Exhibit BB2.1 but little (a), Mr Molefe?     2.1 (a).     Could I ask you please to turn to page PSV57.     Mr Volmink says, and you would have seen this, in the interest of time I’m not going to take you through all of it, he deals with grounds for confinement, paragraphs 125 through to paragraph 131 at page PSV60 and his evidence was that there were no proper grounds for confinement.  If I could take you to 126 at page PSV58 he says, “The confinement memos rely mainly on two grounds, urgency and that services are highly specialised and largely identical”, And then he deals with that and he provides a criticism.     Now, you’ve seen this Mr Molefe, what is your response to Mr Volmink?     So, what Mr Volmink says at 127, “Where urgency was evoked as a ground for confinement the case for urgency was based on revenue related risks and you need to deliver on the MDS.  The memos further stated that if the mitigation plans were not put in place, the corporate plan, capital plan and funding pre-requisites would not be met which would place the entire MDS at risk, however, as already indicated in part one above, the PPM makes clear that confinements will only be considered where a genuine, unforeseeable urgency has arisen”,  And, ultimately, the point that he makes is it wasn’t – the submissions you see in the middle of the next paragraph over the page, the submissions do not explain why revenue risk was unforeseeable, do you want to comment on that?     “Must be genuine unforeseeable urgency”.     He says, the submissions do not explain why the risk was unforeseeable.  Mr Molefe you’ve looked at all of this before.    Those were in little d, I think I asked you keep that file open if you wanted to.      Ja the first one is, I think at 1283.  Mr Chairman, if I may just place one thing on record?     1283, Mr Volmink here, deals with these four contracts and he motivates why the confinement of the four were inappropriate.  We must, however, just bring to your attention, you will recall the evidence of Deirdre Strydom, her evidence was that she considered the confinement of the Manganese contract to be appropriate, so I just don’t want to be taken for misleading the witness, I need to make that qualification.     In respect of one of these contracts, another witness, Deirdre Strydom, gave evidence, the Manganese contract that she considered that the confinement was appropriate.     Mr Molefe perhaps…[intervenes].     Sorry, what paragraph?     Yes.     So, do I understand you to be saying, that different to Mr Volmink that you consider the confinements to have been properly motivated?     So, it was a memo presented to you?     Well, I think what he’s saying is, he doesn’t believe that the requirements for confinement were met.  As I understand you to be saying, well, if you look at the memo what was presented to me was a memo where, on the face of it, those requirements had been met.     Alright.     Can I take you please – are you – you have Mr Volmink’s affidavit still open there?     So, this is Exhibit BB2.1 (a) would you go to page PSV63.     Ja.     You’re in the wrong file Mr Molefe, 2.1 (a) is it not that one that you have in front of you?     Can I direct your attention to paragraph 143 under the heading, “confidential confinements”.     143 yes at page PSV63, are you there?     It says, “Because of the potential for abuse of the confinement process the PPM introduced multiple levels of review and control to service safeguards.  First the end-user department and the operating divisions, Chief Procurement Officer had to submit the request for confinement to the OD’s divisional acquisition council and the OD’s CEO for prior written support. If a request for confinement was poorly motivated the submission would be sent back for re-motivation.  The submission would be sent to Group for sign-off only if it was supported at OD level, it goes on to say at 144, at Group level, the submission had to be reviewed by the Group Chief Supply Chain Officer, GCSCO and the Group Finance Officer, CFO. The practice at Group was that confinements were first sent to the SC and governance for review before they were signed-off by the GCSCO and the GCFO”.      Over the page PSV64, paragraph 145, “If the GCSCO and the GCFO supported the confinement it would be submitted to GCE, the BABC or the Board itself for final approval, depending on the value of the transaction. The process for the approval of confinements is more fully described etcetera.  At paragraph 146, these levels of review were introduced as safeguards to ensure that confinement submissions were subjected to a robust review before they were submitted to the GCE or higher for sign-off.  These safeguards serve to protect the integrity of the confinement process and provided assurance to the ultimate approval authority that the confinement memo was properly considered before being sent to him or her for sign-off, that being the GCE”.     147, “However, for reasons of confidentiality some of the McKinsey confinements such as Manganese, NMPP and iron ore transaction did not follow the normal review and sign-off process.  This meant that the confinements were taken to the GCE with little or no input from reviewing bodies”, You see that?     Now, we’ve seen, in relation to those contracts they were compiled by Mr Singh and you signed them.     I beg your pardon?     “The 2013 PPM states that, in  instances where a confinement is confidential the GCE may approve such confinement without the confinement requests being routed by any other authority.  This was base on a provision in the 2013 DLA framework that allowed for confidential confinements.  There are a number of concerns with the manner in which confidentiality was invoked in the McKinsey confinements.  First, as already stated, multiple layers of review were bypassed as a result of invoking the confidentiality provisions”.      Yes, but perhaps I could ask you if you wouldn’t allow me to also go to another paragraph in the affidavit.     So, firstly, it says there, a number of concerns and he talks about the multiple layers, I understand your answer to that then he says, “Secondly the confinement memos contained very little, if anything that explains why the submissions were confidential”.     Why were these contracts – why were they confidential because there could be a bypassing of the process, potentially but then of course it would need to be confidential.  What was confidential about these four contracts?     So, what page are we on now?     1286, yes.     Sorry?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, so what you’ve explained …[intervenes].     Yes, but those reasons – and that’s Mr Volmink’s point, those are reasons A and D why you go the confinement route, they don’t deal at all with confidential confinements.     Yes, but why does that make it a – the need for a confidential confinement?     Did you?     Sure, I’m asking you, did you understand it at the time.     Mr Molefe if I might just say that I interjected asking exactly the same question as the Chairperson, I simply didn’t understand what you said.  You’re more than at liberty to answer the question.     But you approved this by yourself, these four contracts, you did it yourself.     Yes, but the point is …[intervenes].     Well, that’s really what I’m getting at.     Mr Molefe wouldn’t  you let me speak.     Well, that’s it – you can do what you want but the point is, do you accept that…[intervenes].     You’re probably much worse off if the Chair was asking the questions, so let me rather ask them.     And I mean, in some respects you could help us understand this.  In relation to these four contracts, and you must tell me if my understanding is wrong, from what I’ve seen, you approved them yourself, I mean Mr Singh, it wasn’t a recommendation by him, he compiled it, he gave it to you, and you approved it.     Alright, we’ve seen one other contract – I beg your pardon, confinement that went through multiple layers of approval, also of a confinement, correct?     Now, as I understand what Mr Volmink is saying, is that, really you don’t have the power as the Group Chief Executive to, yourself, approve any confinement.  The only time that you might be able to get close to doing that is in the case of a confidential confinement but even then, he explains that it needs to be reviewed by other parties.  I just want you to assist us with understanding how did you come to – you know we talked about these one-man acquisition councils, how did you come, in the absence of confidential to approving these contracts.    Okay.    Alright so then I need to – and before I move on Mr Forming …    Yes.    Yes you will find that – we were at page 64 last time of Exhibit BB2.1(a).    Sorry PS ja PSV64 that is where we had stopped or in fact I think we had stopped at PSV65.      Whereas Mr Myburgh’s question related to whether you could approve something without it being recommended by somebody else?    Chair I am just going to ask one question really and that is – we have got a lot else to deal with.  But Mr Volmink deals with that and he says in effect you make out a good case for why there should have been a confinement but you make out no case for why it had to be confidential.  Because it is only confidential confinements that you are allowed to – as you point out approve without rooting to any other authority.  But I am not sure there is anything else that needs to be said here.  Do you want to add anything more to your answer?    Yes I just wanted to perhaps to put to you I mean is a good example not of a confidential confinement really where you did not want anyone to know within your organisation you were doing something that needed to be secretive because if people knew about it that it would undermine them.  I mean one can think of many examples I suppose but is that not really what – when you would invoke…    Yes.    Sure.    But I am just trying to engage here would you agree with me – I am trying to work out when would you invoke a confidential confinement presume it is because you do not want other people to know.  You do not want it to go around the organisation because that could itself then breach the confidentiality.    Alright – yes.  So I do not think I can it much further just to repeat that Mr Volmink is saying in response to what you say is that you have made out a good case as to why there should be a confinement on grounds a and b but not one as to why you should invoke the extraordinary confidentiality confinement provision.    I beg your pardon.    Sure and it seems that you at loggerheads there    You have different views when it comes to that.    Oh okay.  Now let me move on – I have then dealt really with so far a whole series of contracts, consultancy contracts, advisory contracts involving Regiments.    Thank you.  Could I then take you back please to Bundle 5 Exhibit BB22 your exhibit.    I think you can keep those – just keep them for the moment.     130 Chairperson – 130.    Let me direct your attention to two other contracts that you were involved in.  At paragraph 51 on 9 September 2014 deadline for submission of the SWAT 2 bid of McKinsey and Regiments.  This is another contract that has been awarded for McKinsey and Regiments on a confinement basis without competitive bidding and which is later discovered to have been used by Regiments to launder Transnet’s payments through Homix and other Gupta laundry vehicles designated by Essa.  You recall that you were one of the signatories to the SWAT 2 confinement?    We will come to that now.  And then the next paragraph 52 we see on the 24t h of March 2015 there is a – was an entry in Mr Sagar’s diary for a meeting with Mr Essa and Wood – you can leave that out for present purposes.  On the same day 25 March Brian Molefe issues his recommendation for the GFB contract to be awarded to McKinsey and Regiments on a confinement basis without any competitive bidding.  This is another contract which is discovered to have been used by Regiments to launder Transnet payments through Gupta laundering company.  You see that?    Perhaps I could just take you to those two contracts quickly.  We are back in Mr Volmink’s bundle Exhibit BB2.1(d).      And this confinement appears at page 1273 or one of them does.  1273 and it is signed at 1280.    And that goes through various layers correct?    And then the GFB contract I think we find at page 1314 or 1315.  PSB 1315.  Is that right?    Yes and it is signed I think through multiple layers at 1322.    Mr Gama, Mr Singh, Mr Molefe this time.  You see that?    Alright so just to summarise Mr Molefe what we have been dealing with for the better part I suppose of the day is the – the 1064 transaction advisors contract that we started out with yesterday.    We have dealt with increases in the scope of that contract.  Increases in payments to Regiments.  We have dealt with the allied China Development Bank loan and payments to Regiments.  We have dealt with the four confinement contracts or confinements that were entered into in four days.  And we have also dealt with these remaining two contracts SWAT 2 and GBF.    That is what we have been dealing with for the better part really of a day.    And as you know certainly according to the money flows team.    All of the or half of the remuneration in effect that was earned by Regiments in respect of those contracts working alongside McKinsey and sometimes by themselves went to Mr Essa and there was then money laundering in favour of the Gupta’s.  I just wanted to put that to you so that you understand the extent of the money laundering.  It ranges through all of those contracts.  You appreciate that I know by now?    Alright.  I want then to turn to the next topic and that is the procurement…    Thank you.  So Mr Molefe I want to now move from the procurement of consultants and advisors to the procurement of – of locomotives and I am going to ask you some questions I am sure as you can imagine in relation to the 95 locomotives, the 100 locomotives.    It is not one discreet bundle.    Chairperson.    And you also want to undertake a bit of housekeeping for that …    I am going to start by going to Exhibit BB3(a).  That is Mr Mahomedy’s bundle.      Yes Chairperson.    Now Mr Molefe I am sure you will appreciate that I am going to have to try and focus in relation to the locomotives onto the core issues otherwise we could literally be here forever.  So you will bear with me.  I am not – I am not trying to be – to trick you or not tell the whole story I deliberately want to try and focus on what I consider to be the key issues.  And in relation to the 95 locomotives I want to start off by just dealing with one discreet issue if I may. And if I could ask you please to turn to Exhibit BB3(a) that is Mr Mahomedy’s exhibit and ask you to turn to page NSM203.  You will see at pages 203, 204 and 205 there the effect of series of emails which I just want to ask you one or two questions about it if I may?    The – we know that the RFP in relation to the 95 locomotives was issued on the 6t h of December 11.    The RFP was issued.    On 6 December 2011.    Is that correct?    Now if you have a look at the email at the foot of page 203 it is from Mr Gary Peter to someone at     So do I understand that at the time that you met with CSR you knew that you were on the point of issuing an RFP?     So it must have been a few days before, on your version?     Yes.     Yes.     And then if you go towards the top of the page, there seems to be ...[intervenes]      What we see at the top of the page, there seems to be a response from CSR on the 19 t h of December.     Yes. “Thank you for your email.  We were pleased to have a chance to meet with your Group CEO, Mr Brian Molefe, at the beginning of December...”     Yes. “We expressed our interest in your tender for 95 electric locomotives in the South African market as well...”     You confirm that?     Alright.     And then ...[intervenes]      Could I ask you then to, please, go to page MSM-205?     Now it seems that what happens there is that the email at the foot of the page comes from CSR. “Dear Mr Molefe.  Please be kind to check attached letter which has already been sent to you, sent by fax to you...” Do you see that?     Do you see the email that I am referring you to?     On the 19 t h.  And do I understand at the top of the page, is that your response?     Yes. “Thank you for your letter.  I forwarded to Mr Gama.  We will process and respond to your request.  Thank you for the interest shown in the tender...”     And can you recall what that letter had said or provided for?     Alright.  I would like now to move to the 100, 21 E-electric locomotives.  Alright?     A 100, 21 E-electric locomotives.  Perhaps just for easy of reference, a hundred locomotives Chairperson.     I think we are going to start getting into Mr Callard’s exhibits now.     Uhm...     Yes.  It is, yes.     Mr Callard is BD-4a.       Alright.  Again, I am going to summarise some of the evidence so that we can try to get to the point.  You will remember that in relation to these locomotives, there was an improved Business Case for confinement to Mars which it also referred to as Mitsui on occasion.       Ja, but we can ...[intervenes]      Yes, okay.     I mean, should I call it Mars or Mitsui?  Which would be the better term?     Okay, let us use Mitsui then.  But we know that ultimately - and we are going to come to the detail – we know that you withdrew this and you recommended instead confinement to CSR.  Correct?     In a memorandum to the board dated the 21 s t of January 2014.     And I take it that you would accept that several grounds for confinement in the Mitsui memo were then reproduced in the CSR memo?     Now you accept also that Mr Callard was the author of the Mitsui Business Case?     Ja.  Alright.  But I think we agree with one another.     And I see you have some documents there.  Do you want to refer to them or what...?     You want to refer to those documents now or do you want to do so later or...?     Alright.  I would like to take you, please, to page FQC-216.       Alright.  So on the 23 r d of January, Mr Callard writes to Mr Gama.     And it seems also to – is it Mr Jiyane, it would have been?     Who is Thammy Jiyane.     Sorry?     No, I am asking you.  It says    Alright.  He says    Alright.  So I would want to take you, if I may, to page FQC-219.     Mr Gama and Mr Callard sent the email to Mr Gama on the 23 r d of July – sorry, January – at     It says    Yes. “The 20-E locomotive is a 22-ton...” This really mirrors what Mr Callard had said. “The 20-E locomotive is a 22-ton per axel locomotive suitable for GFB while the 19-E locomotive is a 26-ton per axel beast suitable for the coal line. The two locomotives types are not inter-operable while CSR can make additional locomotives in China in a very short space of time to mitigate against MDS volume loss. This will be counter to localisation strategy and would have to be spelt out. The 85 locomotives to be assembled by... has not yet commenced. We cannot yet make any argument that this would reduce the risk. In an argument, therefore, on the 20-E ought to have been a GFB argument which then means we accelerate GFB but we need to go out to tender for wanting E-type locomotives.   The 20-E Loco is not heavy haul locomotive but is a less powerful loco than the 19-E...” So would you accept that what Mr Gama really does, is he forwards to Mr Singh the same concern raised by enlarge Mr Callard?     Sorry?     Yes.  And ...[intervenes]  MR     No we certainly are going to ...[intervenes]      Refusing?     Alright.     And did he indicate to you that he is happy to give evidence?     Certainly.       Thank you Mr Molefe.  So just so that I understand it.  When you say that Mr Gama – because we know that we are going to have Mr Gama here.  We will, in time, deal with these locomotives with him but just so that I understand it.  You say you also go the wrong end of the stick?     Yes.     And just so that I understand it.  At this point in time, was presumable Mr Gama was the CEO of Transnet Freight Rail?     He was presumable a rail expert.     Yes.     Well ...[intervenes]      So really Mr Callard was an expert.     Alright.     Okay.  Mister ...[intervenes]      So Mr Molefe, what I just wanted to do is to carry on with this email stream or string.  If you go to page FQC-222.     I have quite a lot still to get through Chair.     But I am going to try my best to focus on what I consider to be the key-issues.     Well, I would think, probably, past seven o’clock.     Six, seven.  I do not know.     Or perhaps you will tell us that when we convene.     And then we can tailor things accordingly.     I mean, we would like to finish today but if we cannot, I suppose that is not the end of the world.    Mr Molefe, I was just dealing with these emails and we have dealt with Mr Gama’s email.  Could I ask you please to go to FQC222 and you see there it appears that Mr Singh then says to Mr Gama on the 24 t h of January, quite early in the morning at 07H02, let us discuss this morning.     Now we know that you then go or there is a memorandum that you signed, that is presented at a BACD meeting.  That is on the 24 t h of January, correct?  The same day.     24 January.  Could I ask you please to go to page FQC244?      And this is quite a lengthy document, it ends at page 267.    And you see that that was not signed by Mr Gama.  Can you explain why not?      Alright.  Then let us go to the BADC meeting on the 24 t h of January where this memorandum served.  Those minutes we find at FQC228.      Yes.      The attendance reflects you and Mr Singh as being present and partial attendance only by Mr Gama, correct?        Now at this meeting on the 24 t h of January, were the concerns of Mr Callard and Mr Gama raised and discussed?      I beg your pardon?      Well, did you raise them?    Yes, but I mean the point is that the concerns raised by Mr Callard and Gama, were they discussed at this meeting, yes or no?    Alright, thank you.  Now let us go to the affidavit of Mr Callard, and could I ask you please to turn to paragraph 49 at page FQC12?    FQC12, yes.  So Mr Callard at    Alright, any other comment?    Alright.  Then you see at 53 that the hundred locomotives were confined to CSR.    And then on the 4 t h of February Mr Callard receives an SMS from Mr Gama in response to his email of the 23 r d of January, stating I have just seen your email.  I would explain to you the GCE’s thinking.  He says that was not followed up. Of course he had seen it before because he    Why did you just not stick with Motsui?      So just as I understand it though, you were in favour yourself of confinement to Motsui?      And you motivated it on a series of ground saying it must go to Motsui.    Subsequently you were in favour of confinement to CSR.        And you motivated on the same grounds.      Right.     And the only thing that caused that as I understand it, is you say a concern was raised about entrenching monopolies.     And who raised that concern?      But had it not been for that, the tender would have been awarded obviously to Motsui.    Yes.     Yes.  Now let us deal with another issue.     I want to turn then to another topic relating to the hundred locomotives and that is the increase in the ETC from 3.8 billion to 4.8 billion.    3.8 to 4.8.  So the evidence seems to be that ...[intervenes]     If tender was awarded to CSR on the 17 t h of March 2014, would you confirm that?     And what Mr Lehur said and he was part of the negotiations, he said that during negotiations an offer was made by Transnet of 38.5 million per loco.  The counter offer from the suppliers was 49 million and you agreed then to 44 million. Does that roughly accord with what you remember?    Yes.      Now ...[intervenes]     Mr Molefe, what happened then according to Mr Lehur.    Mr Lehur.    Is that Mr Singh requested him to prepare a memorandum explaining why the price had increased from the business case submission, effectively to justify what had been agreed, and then he went on to say that on the 23 r d of May 2014 you approved the memorandum to the Board of Directors for an increase in the ETC from 3.8 to 4.8. Let me take you to this document that Mr Lehur prepared together or an instruction of Mr Singh.  That you find in Exhibit BB4(f) and then 2.  So it is quite a complicated ... BB4, you will find in Exhibit BB4(f).   I do    And I would like to go to page 46, in fact the memo starts at 47.      YLRESP, 47.  So hopefully we all have the same thing.  Mr Molefe, do you have there a memorandum at 47 to the Transnet board from yourself?    And if we go to page YLRESP60, there you find the signature page.      And that reflects that you, it was recommended by you on the 23 r d of May 2014, correct?      Ja, you are correct.  Mr Singh, so it is three levels of recommendation.  Mr Singh, Mr Gama and yourself.      It starts at page 47 and the document, the memorandum is signed Chairperson, at page 60.  YLRESP060.      The memorandum that we are looking at, starts at page 47 Chairperson.      BB4(f), yes.    The page is 47, but there is two dividers.  There is a first statement and a second statement.  One needs to get to the second statement, because it does not seem to be consecutively numbered.      Ja.     Not throughout the file, no.    That is correct Chairperson.    In fact mine are numbered differently so, perhaps I could ask my ...[intervenes]     Mr Molefe has divider number 25.  Do you have a 25 Chairperson?    Divider number 25.     Or it is Exhibit 25.      You will remember Chairperson, it seems that this was in the very early days of the commission.    That is correct.    Yes, thank you.    Alright.  So this is the memorandum that we have been speaking of and what I have done, is I had taken you to the signature page just so that DCJ can, Chairperson can see now that he has, we all have the document.     At YLRSP060 ...[intervenes]     There is the ...[intervenes]     There is the recommendation by the three of you Mr Singh, Mr Gama and yourself, and the recommendation 89(b) at the end, is the BOD approves an increase in the estimated total cost for the acquisition of the hundred equivalent class 19E dual voltage electric locomotives or the export coal line from 3.87 billion to 4.840 billion. You confirm that?    Alright.  Now evidence has been given by Mr Callard to the effect that this increase of a billion rand was excessive and unjustifiable.  You know of that evidence?      And also, perhaps more importantly, there was the evidence of an expert in the form of Mr Tjabi who also testified that the increase was excessive and unjustifiable.  Have you seen that evidence?    So what Mr Tjabi said and we can go to his report, is that an increase to 4.1 billion from 3.8 was reasonable but he considered the additional 800 million to be not justifiable.  Have you seen that evidence?    Well, let me take you to that.  You were I think previously given this, but where you will find it, if you will just give me a second ... is in Exhibit BB8(b).    So it is BB8(b) and that is divided into point 1 and point 2.  There are two reports by Mr Tjabi contained in BB8(b).      So Chairperson, do you have Exhibit BB8(b)?  Then you have a point 1 and point 2.      That is right.  If I could take you please to, if you could please go to (b) point 2.  It is the second report in that file, right towards the end.      And it starts, the first page of Mr Tjabi’s report is page and these are only red numbers AOC100001.      It is actually the first page, not ... Mr Molefe, you have the report?  It starts at page 1, are you there?      You have previously been provided with this and you have seen this before.     Alright.  It was actually in fact attached to your, it is one of the annexures to the request for you to file an affidavit.     But let us not worry about that for the moment.  Are you at page 1?     Could I ask you to turn to page 20?  Under the heading conclusion at 5.33 in concluding, having built up the price of the E20 dual voltage electric locomotives provided by CSR as at April 2012 to March 14, allowed for design modification costs as at March 14 to meet Transnet’s 19E dual voltage electric locomotive requirements and mitigated for risks such as foreign currency and inflation, a reasonable stroke acceptable price ETC for the transaction would have been 4.1 billion. The excess of 739 million could not be justified on the basis as explained above.  Have you got any comment on that?      Okay.  Let us then and why do you say that?      Yes, I just really wanted to make the point that Mr Tjabi is an expert.      Yes, he gave expert evidence and you have seen his report before.     But you were given this report before.    Correct?    You did not go to your own expert to get a contrary view, you just want us to accept that look, this is an art, not a science?  I mean that is essentially what you want the Chairperson to do.     Alright.  Have you got anything else to say about Mr Tjabi’s expert opinion?    I just want to take you to something in your ...[intervenes]     I beg your pardon Chairperson.    Bundle 5.    Exhibit B22.  I just want to take you please to the Regulation 10(6) notice, which you will find at page 12, or sorry page 14, black numbers.      Bundle 5, Exhibit 22.    Page and now we are referring to the black numbers on the left hand side, page 14.      Yes.      There, perhaps I can ask you to turn to page 17 and I would like to refer to paragraph 1.6.  Just to confirm that you were asked about the opinion of Alistair Tjabi, at page 17, that the increase in the ETC of a hundred locomotives from 3.8, I paraphrase to 4.8 was unjustified, your attention being drawn to his statement dated the 26 t h of November 2019, Exhibit BB8(b)2.  You were given this report?    Right, and whilst we are on that, there is something I have wanted to ask you some time ago.  If you have a look at paragraph 1.9 on the opposite page, page 18, you see there you were asked a series of questions about McKinsey and Regiments.     Sub one, the confinement and appointment of the consortium including McKinsey, Letsema, etcetera.    Then the decision to replace Letsema.      And Nedbank with Regiments.     The session and the payment of the 78 million, things we have gone through already.  The confinement and the appointment at paragraph 194 of McKinsey on those four contracts that you were involved in.    And also the confinement and award of the GFB breakthrough.    Those are things that you have already dealt with in a lot of detail.    But what I wanted to ask you Mr Molefe, is where do we find in your affidavit your response to all of these issues dealing with the McKinsey and Regiment contracts?  Your affidavit we know, starts at page 28 of Bundle 5, Exhibit BB22.   There is your affidavit.  Perhaps you could just page through it.     Yes.     It has been a long day Mr Chair.     To 28 is Mr Molefe’s affidavit.     So unless I have it wrong and you can correct me, you do not deal with McKenzie or Regiments at all, or do you?      You do not?    Let us ...[intervenes]     Mr Molefe just understand, that in your affidavit nowhere do you say that there is certain topics that I have not dealt with or I have not had enough time.     Yes, I think my learned friend perhaps ...[intervenes]     Mr, we might not be on the same page literally.  Mr Molefe was issued with two different, two 10(6) directives.     I am referring to ...[intervenes]     Yes.     I am referring to the second one.     Alright.    Alright, well let us leave it at that.  So just so that I understand it Mr Molefe, before we move on.  Did you then forget to deal with McKenzie Regiments or did you deliberately not deal with it because you did not have enough time?      Yet you did not mention that in the affidavit?    Alright.  Could I then please take you to Exhibit 27?  That is Bundle 6.      No, I do not think we are Chairperson.    Could I take you please to page 117 of that exhibit, Exhibit 27 in Bundle 6?  This is the Fundudzi report.     117.      Are you there Mr Molefe?    I would just like to draw your attention to some paragraphs in this report.  It starts on page 117 with paragraph 5.6.4.8.  Are you there?  In about the middle of the page.  Mr Molefe?    It says   Do you have any comment on that?      And then ...[intervenes]     And then at paragraph 5.6.4.11, at the    If you go over the page please to 119,    Then towards the bottom of the page,    But it could have been him?    You cannot presumably rule out that it was Mr Sharma?    Then over the page, page 120.  The    Point 9.  So he supported the confinement to CSR.  Well, presumably he must have because he was the Chairperson of the BADC.    Yes.  Then if we can go over the    And then if we can ...[intervenes]     Could I take you then please to page 123, and to the heading the BADC of 21 October, and let me draw your attention to the last two paragraphs.  Paragraph    Could I then please take you to page 124.    At the top, paragraph 5.6.7.2.3   The first paragraph at the top of page 124.      So they indicated that they opted to withdraw, because after the initial confinement there were press reports, alleging that Motsui had entered into a 1.4 billion locomotive procurement secret deal that was concluded without being put out to tender, which the then special advisor to the former Deputy President Mohlante was said to benefit from.    Well, it says management represented by Molefe, Singh, Peter, Difito indicated that upon reflection they opted to withdraw because of this.     Then at paragraph 5.6.7.2.6   And then sub paragraph 8 under that   Next sub paragraph   “During our consultation ...”    In the next sub paragraph   And then sub 13, two paragraphs    Alright and then if I can move onto…    Now I want to move on to page 126.    Under the heading Memorandum to confine through CSR dated 21 January which we have dealt with and go to paragraph 5.6.8.10 the second last one on that page. “We determined that after Singh received the memorandum from Gama he either changed it or had it changed from a confinement to Mitsui to a confinement to CSR.  This is based on the fact that a confinement of the said document signed by Singh and Molefe on 21 January 2014 and 22 January 2014 respectively had the name of the entity for confinement changed from Mitsui to CSR.”    I think you have accepted that.    And then the last paragraph on page 126, 5.6.8.11 “Gama indicated that the memorandum presented by BADC sorry to BADC by Molefe to confine through CSR did not originate from TFR.” Could you take issue with that?    Well where did it originate from?    Ja.    Yes no we know that.    Yes but then there was a change from Mitsui to CSR.    Yes.    Who affected that change?    Yes well precisely.    It did not originate from TFR.    Yes.    No I think we perhaps do on this occasion.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.  And that came from TFR.    But what did not come from TFR was the motivation for confinement to CSR.    Correct.    Okay.  That was done by Mr Singh and you as you say.      He further stated that he made the said conclusion based on the fact that none of the TFR officials signed it and further that TFR recommended a confinement through Mitsui and not CSR.  I presume there is not an issue there.    And so…    Yes.    Myburgh.    It is late in the day.    Mr Molefe.     Sure.    14.    Alright and then if we could go please to page 127 paragraph 5.6.8.12 the top of the page.  You will    I see.  And then if you go to page 129 towards the middle of the page at paragraph 5.6.9.3 this is Mr Jiyane the gentleman you mentioned.  According to Jiyane “The confinement of the 100 locomotives to CSR was brought to his attention by Singh on 24 January 2014 before their attendance to BADC meeting of the said day.”     “Mr Jiyane and Singh – Jiyane and Gama.”    Yes.      But it is – it is consistent with the fact that – that you and Mr Singh were involved in changing the name as I understand it.    Late in the day.    So it is possible that these people did not know about this?    But if you could understand this – this is Mr Gama the CEO of TFR.    Right and Mr Jiyane occupies what position at this time?    But what position did Mr Jiyane occupy?    But it is recorded as them saying it.    Yes.    Yes.    So…    Alright but I need to of course then…    But further Mr Molefe that I understand but you will appreciate that if we had to run that way the commission would never come to an end.  I need to put to you what they found and we are going to get Mr Gama here you know and we will deal with this.    Surely.    I am not accusing you of anything.  I am simply saying…    To you.    Yes.    Let me put the question another way.  Are you …     Are you – are you able to help the Chairperson with the question of whether you think Mr Gama knew about the change before the BADT meeting do you know whether he knew yourself?    Okay.    When you changed the business case you and Mr Singh the – from Mitsui to CSR did you tell Mr Singh that he should distribute that business case to Gama and Jiyane?    No that is not my question Mr – please Mr Molefe.    My question is when you – when you affected the change you and Mr Singh.    To the business case the name – the party Mitsui to CSR did you tell Mr Singh that he must send that revision or new case to Gama and Jiyane?    So do you feel you have answered my question?    But my question had nothing to do with that at all.      No.    It was a very simple question and that is when you changed the party in the confinement/    In the business case from Mitsui to CSR you and Singh did you tell this to Singh that he must send that new thing – that new document to Jiyane and Gama?    That is all it is.    But when you – when you told us about your discussion now right at the end you said you had a discussion with Singh you never mentioned Gama.    No.    Okay.  Alright.  So then I have taken you to paragraph 5.6..3 at page 129 let us go to the next paragraph. “Jiyane further indicated that he was not provided with the memorandum to confine to CSR before the BABC meeting held on 24 January.”    5.6.9.3 it is just below.    He says   Any comment on that?    And then I must then put to you perhaps finally in that regard two paragraphs below that 6.5.9.6 “Jiyane indicated that he was not certain that CSR could manufacture the 19E locomotives as required by TFR because they had not supplied the 19E locomotives to TFR before.”    And then two last paragraphs if I may at page 130 in the middle of the page paragraph 5.6.9.10. “We determine that as per the procurement procedures manual version 2 October 2013 requirement the end user in this case TFR should be the one motivating the procurement process to be followed ie confinement or tender before the memorandum may be taken to Transnet Group for recommendation to be BADC.  We determine that Gama and Jiyane as the end users did not motivate with the confinement of 100 locomotives to CSR.” You did and Mr Singh did.    What is your response to this?    But this is not – this is not a Gama and Jiyane thing.  You have accepted that you and Singh motivated.    The point is that what MNS is saying is that is in breach of the PPM.    An oversight not to include the people from TFR?    Yes alright.    And then let us go to the last paragraph I want to take you to 5.6.9.11. “We determined that paragraph 15.1.5 of the 13 PPM states that “the submission for confinement must be fully motivated in writing by the end user and the operational division Chief Procurement Officer TFR to operational divisions main acquisition council AC and the operations division Chief Executive Officer for prior written support of the recommendation to confine. The submission should be submitted on the relevant template undercover of a memo.” Any comment on that?    So you think this may have been an oversight as you have said?    You have said it could have been an oversight as you put it?    If I may just take us – a moment?    Yes absolutely.    Of course one is dealing here with the high volume or high value contract – massive contract, correct?    Alright let us then move on to the procurement of the 1064 locomotives.    Well I assume that Mr Molefe says he wants to call it a day now.    Or does he want to take a break?    Ja I really do not think that is unreasonable at all Chairperson.    Chair just to perhaps outline what I have still got to deal with.    We must deal with the 1064 which I think will probably take as much time as dealing with the 100 an hour or two.  Then what we need to deal with are some procedural issues in relation to that.  Then we have got to deal with some of the Neotel and T-System contracts and then a number of miscellaneous issues and of course we have not got yet to Witness 1 and 3.  So there is quite a bit that still needs to be traversed I am afraid.    I would certainly try my best to finish Mr Molefe in the morning session.    If we were to start at ten or half past nine by one o’clock.    I do not think it can be done realistically faster than that Chairperson.    So I would prefer and I am in your hands Chairperson to finish Mr Molefe.    But as you know with Mr Gama there is some flexibility because we..    Have agreed to reduce the issues that would be dealt with.    It may be that we can even confine them    To a greater extent.    So that we do not disturb the schedule too much.    Yes with your leave.    Mr Chairperson.    What it would also enable us to do is I mean the documents the four documents that Mr Molefe has introduced it is obviously important.    That we get the Secretariat to add those formally to the bundle.    And they will be paginated and added to all our files and he can then address them.  I do not want it to be seen that we are not giving him opportunity to discuss those documents.    Thank you Chairperson. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, thank you, DCJ.     Thank you, Chairperson.  Good morning, Mr Molefe.     I just want to go back a little before I go forward.  Yesterday we dealt with the session by McKinsey to Regiments, do you remember that?     Was on the 16 April that Mr Sagar of McKinsey advised Mr Singh that McKinsey with effect from the 5 February ceded its rights and obligations to Regiments.  I just want to – I think you might have raised the point with me as to whether there was anything wrong with that cession from McKinsey to Regiments.  I would just want to refer you to …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chairperson.     Thank you, Chairperson.       So I just want to raise one thing with you or show – point out one thing to you, could you please go to bundle 6 to the MNS report.  So this is then volume 27.     Bundle 6.     EXHIBIT 27.     Page 383.     I just want to point out one thing to you, if I could ask you to look at paragraph 2.4.20.  In dealing     Ja.     Mr Molefe, I notice that you are reading from something on your phone.     I do not necessarily have an objection to that.  Protocol would be that you would then have to share with us anything that you reading from that is in writing.     As I say, I have no objection to that but the protocol is they should be shared with us.     I would not like for the questioning to be delayed perhaps it is something that we can try and deal with at lunchtime.     And if you could perhaps on that basis permit  Mr …[intervenes]     Alright.  Chair, just a simple point, I mean, I am just pointing out to you the finding, you can deal with it if you want or not.  They say that the cession was invalid because the LOI had expired.  It is really as simple as that.     Alright.     Yes, yes.     Mr Molefe, just so that I capture your evidence, you say you dispute that point because you say the LOI had been extended.     Alright, now you do not, fine.  So let us then go please – we added the page, remember when I read to you about Regiments Capital’s replacement of Nedbank.  I read you a letter yesterday.  Now that has been inserted now into bundle 5, EXHIBIT 22, your exhibit, could you please go there?     Page 405.96.     Yes.  So that would be after – right at the end of the file, after the CIPRO reports.     96, Chair.     So this is the letter that I read yesterday, you see it is from Mr Singh dated the 19 November.     And ultimately – we have been through this before, it is really just a matter of placing the letter properly on the record.     The letter ends by Mr Singh saying    Yes.     McKinsey chose Regiments.     Are you aware of the evidence in relation to Mr Sagar at McKinsey?     That there seems, as we went through yesterday, there is a possibility that he – you can go back to the report, was dealing with Mr Essa.     Mr Essa.     But you confirmed that Regiments Capital then replaces Nedbank as per this letter.     Alright.  Now …[intervenes]     Yes, we are going to come back to that.  Now I also yesterday gave you the opportunity  to reflect on two memoranda overnight.  We had not dealt with the one but we had dealt with the first one.     Can I ask you please to go back to page 405.1?     Of bundle 5.  405.1.     So, Mr Molefe, just to orientate you, this was the memorandum that you approved, where you approved of the replacement of Letsema.  Is there anything that you want to, now having had the opportunity of studying it, is there anything that you want to say more than what you dealt with yesterday?     The memorandum you see at paragraph     Is there anything you want to add?     Yes, I know that.     So who picked up the conflict?  Not McKinsey.     Yes, who.     Was it you?     Yes, well I am asking you, was it you?     So you do not have firsthand knowledge of this?     Well, you did not pick it up but you say it was brought to your attention, presumably.     You see, Mr Molefe, you said something quite important, you said this was picked up during the bids and then I think you sought to correct yourself because of course it was not picked up because what we know, and we went through this yesterday, we know that on the 27 July the contract was awarded to the McKinsey Consortium including Letsema.  Now what we see on the 22 of August, about a month later, is a decision in terms of which Letsema should be removed.  So – sorry, if I am just going to press you, I am going to ask you only one more question.  You do not know who brought this to your attention and you do not know why it was not picked up during the bids, is that correct?     Yes.     Yes, that I know.     Yes.     So I want to just confirm two facts before I move on, you confirm that it was something picked up by Transnet.     Alright and secondly you do not know why it was not picked up during the bid adjudication process.     And thirdly, you do not know who brought this to your attention.     Right.     We can ask Mr Singh, I suppose.     Can we then get to …[intervenes]     Can you then go to the next document and that you find at 105.7?  I just started dealing with this yesterday when you indicated that you needed more time to reflect on it and we then adjourned early to enable you to look at is.  Now I want to go through this …[intervenes]     Yes.  What you did confirm yesterday …[intervenes]     405, I beg your pardon, DCJ.     Point 7  So if you could just – if I could take you please just to get you to confirm again what you dealt with yesterday.  If you go to point 15, 405.15..     So you noted that Mr Singh had sent this to you on the 16 April 2014.     And we confirmed that that was the same date that Mr Sagar had advised Mr Singh of the cession to Regiments, correct?     405.15.     And yesterday you confirmed and we went through the documents, Mr Molefe, that that is the same date that Mr Sagar of McKinsey advised Mr Singh that McKinsey had ceded its rights and obligations to Regiments.     Yes but it is exactly the same date.     So let us then go through this document, if we may, in more detail and let me not just go to the conclusion.  Now just to locate and perhaps remind the Chairperson the net effect of this because ultimately there was approval for payment to Regiments I think of an additional R78 million in fees, correct?     Let us go through how that came about and let us have a look at this …[intervenes]     Yes, we are going to deal with the memo and we will get there.     Yes.  Yes, it is a changed model.     It was proposed on the same day that McKinsey fell out with all its rights and obligations ceded to Regiments on the same day, correct?     Alright.  So let us then go to page 405.7.  Now let us go through this thoroughly because it – I think you were right yesterday when you indicated that it is certainly deserving of this because of course we know that you approved of this.  Now let us have a look at paragraph 1.  “The purpose of this memorandum is to request the     405.7.     Bundle 5.  Point 7, DCJ.     7.     It is a memorandum to Mr Molefe from Mr Singh.     Just hang on a moment?  Do you have it, DCJ?     Yes, Mr Molefe?  Who is the transaction adviser referred to here?     I just want to make the point that this is something that you were asked to deal with in your affidavit.     No, of course not, because that was the whole point that I made out the outset.     I understood that Mr Molefe had decided he is not going to refer to his notes.     If he now wants to refer to them and they have been typed out then perhaps it is best that we just get a copy.     Especially if it deals with this.     I am going to take Mr Molefe, though, and I am going to point out to him the 10.6’s that were mentioned to him where he in fact, to the best of my recollection was asked to deal with this but Chair, we are in hands, if you wish …[intervenes]     Certainly.     So, Mr Molefe, as I say, let us sort that out over lunchtime, maybe the notes can be mailed to someone at the Commission and we will then print them out.  Do not have any difficulty with you referring to your notes if you wish to on this.  Alright?  Now but before you tell us what is in your notes, I am going to take you through this memorandum …[intervenes]     I want you to please answer my question.  Paragraph 1.1, when it refers to …[intervenes]     The question is, who is the transaction adviser referred to in paragraph 1.1?     Who is it?     Right.     Are you able to tell us before you go into a long explanation who the transaction is or not?     Mr Molefe, I am happy to allow you to explain yourself but are you able to tell us who the …[intervenes]     Yes and …[intervenes]     1.1.     Yes, so the short answer is you do not know.     When you read this – because, of course you approved this, a hugely important …[intervenes]     Sorry, do you mind if I could just finish?     When you read this document before approving it, who did you think the transaction adviser was there?     Thank you.       Before lunch we were dealing with the China Development Bank loan.  I had wrapped up on that but I just wanted to ask you this.  Did I understand your evidence to be that generally when it came to Mr Singh and Ms Makgatho that you did not take sides or choose one above the other.     Alright.  Could I perhaps in that regard ask you to turn to page 18, MEN18, so that is EXHIBIT BB10, Ms Makgatho’s exhibit.  I want to ask you a few questions in that context around the so-called R5 billion proposal which she deals with in her affidavit.      MEN18.     Mr Chairperson, in EXHIBIT BB10a.  Now if I could direct your attention to paragraph 68 and I am not going to deal with the whole paragraph, I am just going to use the first sentence to locate us in time.  She     I beg your pardon …[intervenes]     MEN, it is important, because of course MM is Mr Mohamed, I do beg your pardon.     MEN19.  Are you there, Mr Molefe?     At paragraph 71 she says    Do you want to comment on that?     Okay.  She goes on to say at paragraph     Does that job your memory at all?     Sorry?     Urgently, alright.     So if we could go then over the page to MEM20, paragraph 73.  “The proposed facility was priced much higher than normal facilities or similar loan facilities or domestic bonds.  My calculation indicated that Transnet would have to pay an additional 150 million per annum in interest payments over and above what Transnet pays for similar facilities.  This translated into potential losses of 750 million over a five year period.  I shared my analysis with Anoj Singh and indicated that I do not recommend the proposal given potential excessive costs in interest payments.”      “He responded saying that it is an instruction from Brian Molefe and that I should quickly complete the memorandum for approval the same day.”     She says in the next paragraph    Paragraph 75    Look, Mr Molefe, just can we – I am going to come to paragraph 83 if you would like to.     But let me first deal with paragraph 75.  Do you have any comment on it?     But do you remember this meeting where she said if we recommend this, if we do this, we are going to go to jail for stealing money.     So you do remember that?     So had you given the instruction that this funding proposal be completed and signed off in one day?     Okay, so let us then go to 76    But, of course, the question arises is how could you ever have required Ms Makgatho to sign off on this in one day, firstly.     And sorry, if you will let me finish.  And secondly, on this version how possibly could you have sought to endorse this type of proposal?     so you do not have any recollection of that?  This was a proposal …[intervenes]     Yes but that does not – that is not an answer to what I am probing with you, if you do not mind.  This was a Regiments’ proposal, is that right?     Ja, she says at 72    And what would the arrangement fee typically have been?     Yes, I am asking you typically what would it have been for a loan like this?  You dealt with Regiments and McKinsey in other context like we have been through.     Are you able to give us any insight from the position of Group Chief Executive what – well, what sort of transaction arrangement fee would you have expected Regiments to levy for this sort of loan facility?     So how much would that have translated into?     Yes?     Right.  And the other thing I wanted to indicate to you, how could you – but I think you accept that what you dispute is you did not require this to be done in a day but you were effectively looking to implement this loan agreement.       Is she wrong?  Is she wrong when she says that.     Oh.     Right.     But Mr Singh’s evidence is it is what you wanted or play her version of what Mr Singh says is that it is something that you wanted.     Now that I understand, but was it still your proposal? I understand that you did not …[intervenes]     So insofar as she is saying that Mr Singh told her that that – I suppose we will have to canvass with Mr Singh.     This paints you in a very – potentially a bad light, does it not?     Does it not?     So …[intervenes]     I am just wondering why you never put in a statement contesting this.     But, Mr Molefe, the fact something is not done does not mean that it does not reflect potentially very poorly on you.     But then why did you not at least put in a statement to say that or something?     Yes.     Oaky, so just so that I have this because of course Mr Singh is going to give evidence.  Do you, as far as you are concerned, was this Mr Singh’s proposal.     And she did not tell you who the instruction had come from?     Oh, so you now – it was Mr Singh.     Her evidence, when you point to that says that Singh says it was your proposal.     Ja.     I beg your pardon?     No, it is not semantics, Mr Molefe, I am trying to get to the bottom …[intervenes]     I want to simply ask you and I am going to move to another topic then.     You understand that it was Mr Singh’s proposal.  You say it was not your proposal.  Did you understand from your interaction with Ms Makgatho that it was Mr Singh’s proposal?     Well, who would have the authority to make such a proposal?     To ask Ms Makgatho to approve such a proposal in one day.  Who would have been able to give her such an instruction? MR     Anybody else?     Would anybody else have been able …[intervenes]     So on the face of it, it seemed – did you assume that it was Mr Singh or not?     Thank you, Chairperson.  Alright, I would like to turn then to a different topic.  Still under the heading of procuring consulting or advisers.     No, that bundle can be put away.  If I could ask you please to retrieve, Chairperson, bundle 5.     EXHIBIT 22, yes.     EXHIBIT 22, yes, thank you.     Now what I am going to deal with, Mr Molefe, are the – what I refer to as the McKinsey/Regiments consultancy contracts.  But perhaps I could start by asking you to go to page 129 of EXHIBIT 22.  Bundle 5, it is your exhibit.     Bundle 5, EXHIBIT 22, page 129, Chair.     Thank you.  I would like just to draw your attention to a chronology set out – this is the first money flows report and we will come back to it later.     But it is paragraphs 44, 45 and 46 on page 129.      You will see that it is recorded that    Then    And then if you could go to paragraph 49, that is over the page, you will see there they record     And whilst we are here, perhaps I could ask you to turn to page 330 in the same bundle and at 330 you would find the bid by McKinsey, also included Regiments we will see in a moment and this related to the coal line.  Do you see that, at 330?     If I could ask you please to go forward to page 345?  You will see there that there is a piece on McKinsey and Company and then at the bottom of the piece on Regiments.  Do you see that?  At 345.     Then over the page to 346 there is a     And then …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Did you ever see this document?     And then if we go to page 350, this is a similar bid dealing with the …[intervenes]     350 is the cover sheet, you are right.  351 and 352, you will see it deal with the bid in relation to NMPP.  Do you see that?     Contains the same content if you go to 361 in relation to McKinsey and then over the page 362 you will see this time the third bullet point under the     So the long and the short of the money flow streams work reflects that we have four contracts concluded on a confinement basis in four days and then there were bids submitted by McKinsey and Regiments, they indicated, that Regiments, that they would be appointing Homix and Albatime as their skill development partners and money flows say that ultimately what happened is that Homix, the Gupta laundering vehicle was ultimately paid more than R100 million from the proceeds received.  Do you see that?     Now, as I understand your evidence, Mr Molefe, and I do not want to make you angry after lunch, as I understand your evidence, you say you knew nothing about this.     Ja.     We are going to come to that now, I just want to understand, you knew nothing about, as you said repeatedly, the money laundering.     The money laundering.     Okay.   So could I ask you please to go to EXHIBIT BB2.1(d).     Just give me a second please?     Ja, 1283.  You may have the wrong file, so it is BB2.1(d).  I think you may have preceding number.     D for Deidre, ja.     No.     No, you need small letter d, so Mr ...[audio cut] ... in regard to Annexures A, B, C and D. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chairperson.     Good morning.       Yes.     Yes, which page?     382.     I also note that the cession was not approved by Transnet.     And that the cession was only approved the following year in April.  Sorry, in May.  The LOI was …[intervenes]     Yes.     It is my notes that I made last night.     I have not made copies of these notes but it is just handwritten notes on the form.     Can I use my notebook?     To read from.     On the notebook or on the phone, it is the same notes.     Yes.     Yes.     The copies of my – of the notes that I made on my notebook as I was …[intervenes]     But I am just going to go …[intervenes]     No, but Chair, these notes are to remind me exactly what is written in this document and where it is.     But, Chair, if I see a section here that I want to refer to and then I wrote on my notebook that paragraph 2.4.2.1, must I then share that...     Okay, I will not use the notes.     Yes but the LOI had been renewed several times.     And what I was just about to check now, because I did make a note about it, was in the three times, it was renewed three times, but I think it was also renewed – the MSA was then entered into at some point.     So I just wanted to check exactly when and how …[intervenes]     No, I wanted to verify it for myself, Chair, but now if I cannot use my notes – alright, I do not dispute it.     Regiments’ letter?     In bundle 5?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Nedbank was conflicted because they wanted to do the funding as well and McKinsey confirmed that Nedbank was conflicted.     And my understanding is that Regiments had a choice as to who should replace Nedbank in that consortium and they chose Regiments of their own volition.     Yes.     Which part of the evidence?     With?     No, I am not aware of that.     I confirmed that McKinsey then replaced Nedbank with Regiments.     And that is MNS.     Yes.     Of which bundle?     Bundle 5?     Yes.     You say this memorandum approves the appointment of Letsema?     Yes, Letsema …[intervenes]     Letsema had a conflict.     Because Barloworld, which was advising them, was also building engines for Caterpillar which engines were used by EMD and EMD was a bidder, so Letsema had a conflict.  What then happened is that McKinsey was informed of the conflict and then asked to appoint somebody else instead of Letsema.     I think it was Transnet.     But the conflict was real, I am not sure who picked it up.     No, I say I am not sure who picked it up.     No, it was not me.     Of the conflict.     It was brought to Transnet’s attention.  This conflict must have been picked in the process of receiving the bids or, I do not know, but they knew that EMD, EMD’s engines were going to be – sorry, EMD’s engines were Barloworld engines from Caterpillar and so EMD was bidding or intended to bid for the 1064 and so there was potential conflict and this was raised and then after it was raised – unfortunately, I do not have the piece of paper where it was raised.     No, no, no, not during these bids.     Not during the appointment of the transaction adviser but after the appointment of the transaction adviser.     I cannot recall how but yesterday, last night, I did jog my memory.     And remembered that Barloworld Engines, Caterpillar Engines, are used by EMD, which is an American company and EMD was going to – had expressed an interest to bid for the 1064 and, as I recall, Letsema was in partnership with Barloworld and so it was pointed out actually this is a conflict, Letsema cannot advise on the award of the 1064 when the engines for one of the bidders was coming from Barloworld. ADV     So, unfortunately, because I am not at Transnet, I do not have access to the documents but as I was sitting and remembering the situation, this is what came to my mind and it actually just came back very clearly.     Yes.     I do not why it was not picked up during the bid adjudication process.     I cannot remember who brought this to my attention.     But, Mr Myburgh, if you are interested you can certainly ask Transnet to provide information on this.  I am sure that there is information at Transnet.     You can ask Mr Singh.     But it would easier to get the documents from Transnet.     105.7 in the same bundle?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Yes.     Yes, with effect from the 5 February.     Yes.     Correct.     Have you just asked me a question?     No, I was just going to say the correct terminology would be that this document is a model for the remuneration of the transaction advisers.     Yes, this is a new model.     Yes.     Chairperson …[intervenes]     I did make notes and I would request that – and actually they are typed out properly and I would request that when we get an opportunity to print them that we share them, but that I be allowed to refer to them.     I did.  No, not in my affidavit, yesterday.  Yesterday when I got these documents.     I have the notes and soft copy, Chair.     My understanding is that I am here to assist the Commission.     And give evidence to the best of my ability.     And that is what I am trying to do.     And I am saying that to do that I need to refer to what I wrote last night.     After the discussion that we had last time.     I do not understand why it then becomes necessary to refer me back to the notices that were given me some time ago because …[intervenes]     But they are not – are you going to allow me to answer the question that …[intervenes]     But there was a question before that.     Yes.     That is why I wanted to refer to my notes.     If you will allow me, Chair.     The MSA was not concluded on time.     Chair, I am really trying to help the Commission with information.     That I have.     And if Mr Myburgh is going to interject and pin me into answers that are not helpful, I do not think it is good for the Commission, I do not think the objective of the Commission of arriving at the truth will be achieved.     I think Mr Myburgh must exercise some patience and listen.     But give 15 seconds to say what I want to say.     Which is that on the 21 February the MSA was concluded with McKinsey, on the 21 February.  Now the reason this is confusing is because later on on the 16 April McKinsey then says that no, we are ceding everything to …[intervenes]     Regiments.  And yet from the 5 February, and yet McKinsey had signed MSA on the 21 s t, on a date after it had exited the transaction exposed to a date that is preceding.  So as I was reading this, I myself got confused and wondered why the legal people never picked this up.  So the answer to Mr Myburgh’s question, I do not know, it is not a straightforward answer because McKinsey signed the MSA which made them the transaction adviser and then later on they ceded it to – they ceded the …[intervenes]     The agreement to Regiments.  On that date that is before they signed so actually it is not a straightforward answer.     So even as I am sitting here, I am confused, I do not …[intervenes]     I do not know what the answer is.     Because it is confusing.     And even if I was going through this I was wondering myself but perhaps the legal people who were drafting these agreements and who were involved from a legal point of view on these matters should explain what really happened here because I was not even aware of this until I went through it last night and get proper timelines about who did what where.  But what then happened is, I was – the MSA was signed by McKinsey on the 21 s t.     Before the actual cession …[intervenes]     The cession was before the date.     Ja.     The effective date was before the date that they actually signed.  So I do not know actually that even on this day, if we had a transaction adviser because then on the 21 s t, when they signed, in terms of their cession, they were no longer the transaction adviser, so I do not know who the transaction – it is a question that would require the legal people that were involved to explain.     I do not know.     Yes, after …[intervenes]     Yes.     When I read ...[intervenes]      At the time yes, yes, Mr Myburgh I was talking about at the time, I do not think it was necessary to remind about that it was at the time.  That is exactly what I was trying to say, please do not put words into my mouth Mr Myburgh.     Could you please allow me to answer it.      When I read this at the time, this was a model of how the transaction advisory services, I mean, the transaction, as I call it, the remuneration model for the advisors would work.  And when I read this model, it was at the time it was with the understanding that we have appointed transaction advisors, I was not aware of all this contract, legalities of contracts that had transpired in the battle. I thought that what was presented to me was that we have advisors, and this is how we are going to share - how we going to - the remuneration of the transaction advisors is going to work.  So this was an approval of a remuneration model of the transaction advisors.     Yes.     Yes, and my understanding of that was that McKinsey as the main contractor is allocating some work were done by Regiment and of course that is normal in the context of sub-contractor.  So I was not aware of what I had explained, I have explained earlier, that in fact, they had been, in fact, the session that happened on the day that the memo was sent to me, as well as that it was on the fifth and that they had fined the MSA on a later date.      Yes.     Yes.      Yes.      Just to add, Myburgh.     I had no beef with those with those intentions of the stuff.     Yes.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes, and then that letter was amended three times.     Yes.     Yes.      Yes, but this does not say that McKinsey is no longer in the picture.      It is not just about the distribution of work in the consortium.      As I say this was a this was a split of the work in the consortium.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.      Yes, I saw it last night when I was reading it.     Yes. ADV MYBURGH     Yes.      Yes.      However, I am not sure if you understand Mr Myburgh that what this memo actually says is that for reason stated in the memo, Regiments managed to save us when R2.8billion. So they made - they saved us R2.8billion at Transnet and for the bringing into the kitty R2.8billion, it was being recommended that they should be paid R78million for the R2.8billion that they had put in.  And the memo says that, well, it is not possible to pay them the R78million, because the original remuneration model does not allow it.  This is despite the fact that Regiment had protested in the beginning, that they prefer to be remunerated on a different base, and now Regiment was coming back and saying, guys, I have already saved you R2.8billion.  So please, can you reconsider the remuneration model that would effectively allow me to be paid another R78million and what I simply did, I looked at the situation, I thought R2.8billion is not bad for R78million, and I approved it, that is in English, that is what happened.      Chairperson, I did not have to but one of the things that was uppermost in my mind was that if these people have done what they say they have done, and they have saved us, R2.8billion you really have to incentivise them to do more, because by refusing, they will just stick to what – to doing what they get paid to doing.  And that is not necessarily in the interest of the company.  So it is a well-known principle in business, that remuneration should be linked to the benefits to the company.      No, the original model did not anticipate the situation.       Yes, because of the R2.8billion that was on the table, or whether or not I mean, R2.8billion that is purported to be on the table I was prepared to reconsider and say, well, if these people are performing so well, we should consider paying them R78million out of the R2.8billion.      No, we did not have to.      But we could.      Mr Myburgh I am telling you, that the reason I did it, I did not do it, because I like Regiment.  I did not do it, because I have a particular dislike for anybody or whatever. I did it because there was R2.8billion on the table.  I do not know if you understand what R2.8billion means, for a company like Transnet, which made in 2016, a net profit after tax of R4billion. It was not insignificant and I think for R78million, I felt that this could be done.  This is a decision that would typically be taken by a CEO in my position.  This was nothing out of line, Mr Myburgh.      I do not know.       Hey?      Did you say I do? ADV MYBURGH      No, I do not know what happened to half of the money.       I did not know that at the time, even now I do not know it other than the fact that you said it.       I think your question Mr Myburgh would be fair, if it was, had you known that half of this money would go to Mr Essa, would you have taken the decision?       And the answer might be different, I do not know what I would have thought at the time and I do not want to speculate on it.  But that is not what was on the table at the time, we were confronting objective facts, and the objective facts are that there was R2.8billion on the table.  The people were asking to be remunerated for it and I thought that for all purposes of ensuring that in future, we can even have more savings if we can encourage them to do these structures that they did, we should pay them R78million, what you came up with yesterday and what has come up in this Commission are things that were not in my knowledge at the time,      Just to Mr Myburgh I actually did not know Me Essa.      Ja, but you are saying that money was paid to Mr Essa I did not even know who Mr Essa is.      No, I knew when, where do you get the evidence that I knew?  I mean, is it evidence that has been presented to the Commission or is it your own evidence that I knew?  Where do you get it, so why do you make such a wild irresponsible accusation?      No, you cannot say that I knew that they were going to use it for money laundering unless you are a…[intervene]      Which doctor?       I do not mind what you going to – what you are trying to explain.  I take exception to the fact that you say that I knew.      What did you say, I mean?      Maybe we should ask for the record to be read again.      No, he said you knew what was happening.       Yes.      Yes, but I hope Chairperson that we are not in this commission to entertain Mr Myburgh’s preconceived conspiracy theories.  I hope that we are here to listen to objective evidence that is not tainted by what Mr Myburgh may have read in the newspapers, may have read in other affidavits and so.  I am not here to answer what is in Mr Myburgh’s head or to confirm his conspiracy theory.   I am here to give evidence and my objective evidence is, I have approved this because there was R2.8billion on the table, and that I did not know that Mr Essa was involved.  There is nowhere in this document that says that this money will go to Mr Essa.       Chair, my evidence is that I did not know, in the interest of progress let us move on.      Chairperson, I agree, but I do not think…[intervene]      No, I did not want to say something Chair, no, I did not want to say anything Chair I accept what my counsel said, we can lay the matter to rest as long as we remember that my understanding is that this is not an accusatorial hearing.      It is here to extract information to get to the truth.  Now the moment we start pointing fingers and said you knew despite the fact that I say I did not, I think it is problematic.      Yes, no I understand Chair.      Which page number?     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh I – are we done with that paragraph?    Yes.    Yes.    It does not have the context that I put here.    To say that the R78.4 million was in recognition of the fact that they had saved us R2.8 billion.  So the R78.4 million on its own make it like this – looks like a lot of money, it looks like unreasonable and it would surprise people with an untrained eye like MNS but if they had put it in context it might have not surprised me at all.  So that is the comment that I want to make that this is actually misleading because it does not put everything into context.      Yes.    Yes.    No I do not know who he was.    Yes.  Yes.    Yes, yes I do not remember meeting him.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr Myburgh I do not why – I do not know why you choose to leave out what is in the MNS Report about Mr Thomas when he said that he wrote on the 24t h of April a memorandum objecting to the revenue sharing model.  He wrote a memorandum which you are now referring to.      No sorry I was under the impression that you just ignoring it.    I thought you are sweeping it under the carpet.    No – I would – I would prefer not to comment on Mr ….    Thomas’ memorandum because it is a memorandum that never reached me that I did not have at the time a fair chance to consider.      Well the representations.    I would have preferred that you start there.  To say that Mr Thomas did write the memo but that memo did not go anywhere and that for whatever reasons it did not go anywhere.  It never came to the attention of Mr Molefe however Mr Thomas feels that the payment was not necessary.    No Chairperson I can only talk about what happened at the time.  What I feel now I mean I feel that perhaps if I had seen Mr Thomas’ memorandum I may have reconsidered but I did not.    And the objective facts are that I did not and that I at the time was convinced that the payment R70.8.4 million was justified.    Mr Peter was very senior more senior than Mr – I suspect Mr Peter was Mr Thomas’ boss, yes Mr Peter was in the finance department I think not responsible for procurement but responsible for I cannot remember the terminology now.    No, no.    I remember now – Supply Chain – no I am not sure but he was – he was in the procurement space.  He put together the procurement transactions.    Well it depends on what – to who the memorandum was addressed.  If it was addressed to me by Mr Thomas with the intention that it should go through the different levels until it reaches me I would have expected it to reach me.  But if it was a memorandum that he just addressed to Mr Peter then – then perhaps the fact that it did not reach me should not surprise anyone.    Who was it addressed to?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    The way the system works – worked if Mr Thomas wanted to bring anything to my attention he had to write a memo to Mr Molefe and at the bottom say that the – I have compiled this memo and these are the issue in the memo recommendation and so on.  It would go to his boss.  If the boss was not obliged to agree with him but he was obliged to pass it on to Mr Singh and then to myself and so it would arrive at me with memo compiled by Mr Thomas not recommended by Mr Peter, not recommended by Mr Singh but nevertheless brought to me for my attention it was addressed.    Yes.  Now that adds to the confusion of who signed the MSA that I referred to earlier which is a legal conundrum that has now just come to my attention.    Because now Transnet and Regiments conclude an addendum to the MSA and yet the evidence was on – I MNS Report that the MSA was signed by – by    And – and can I tell you something also.    That also flabbergasts me genuinely is that when payments other – for example the payment of that R78.4 million the finance division before they make a payment they have to see the agreement on which the payment is based.  So my question then on reading this was so what was used?  And those things were outside of my knowledge Chairperson.    Yes.    Well that is news to me because as I say at the time of signing that memorandum I did not trust the bona fide – I did – I did not question the bona fide’s.  There was nothing that would have made me to be suspicious that this is indeed not the case what has been represented.    Yes.    Yes.    No it was recommended internally.    So the people that had engaged with the service providers.    Then sent it to me.    That everything is fine.  However – however this statement of MNS may be disputed as well.  Perhaps when they come here they will say we do not agree with MNS that this was indeed the case and they will say that there were seen.  All I am saying is the representation that was made to me was that there were savings and I had – and I trusted the bona fide’s of my – the people that I worked with – my colleagues that this is in fact the case.    R2.8 billion.    No I did not Chair.  You know…    We were – my attitude was when you are a Group Chief Executive of a company they have to trust your colleagues – you have to trust your subordinates.  So if they tell you that it is raining outside you do not take out your hands through the window and check if it is raining.    And – and unless that trust is broken at some point but I remember in team building there was an exercise that we used to do where we all hold hands in one line and everybody is blindfolded except the people – the person in front so you have to trust that person even if walking in water.  But you have to say okay he can see I cannot see and that is how it works because in a sense from where I see it this was not the only issue that I was dealing with and I had to trust the people that were giving me information on this particular issue.    Yes.    Yes.    I think we may have had a discussion one on one where I asked him to take me through the memorandum and explain to me what it is about and he did and that I was (inaudible).    I may have yes but that is not recorded anywhere and – but I seem to recall that we did that.  That I said Anoj what is this about?  And then he came into my office and said explain – took me through the memorandum point by point and said they have saved us R2.8 billion and then …    No.    No I do not remember.    When they discussed – the discussion I just wanted to understand why we are paying Regiments R78 million.    Who?    Sedumeni.    Yes he has testified.    And I was forced to take both the report and as well as their testimony here with – with just a little bit more than a tablespoon of salt when it emerged in the press that in fact they were possibly involved in a bribe as MNS and although the press ombudsman had ruled that there was no substance to the allegation the press ombudsman did publish a conversation between one of their partners and somebody at Transnet where they were really – were talking about the payment of – of what appeared to be a bribe.  And so – and so even – even now when I read this report I – I read it in that context that these were possibly people that were not objective.    Yes I cannot comment on that – perhaps the people that had written the memo that has an opposing view to this if they come here perhaps they will give evidence to the extent that this is not correct.  But like I said coming from MNS tablespoon of salt.    No I know it to the extent that it was represented to me.    Before.    Yes.    And over and above that Chair I trusted that we have quite a robust internal audit and what I considered to be a robust legal department and that it was not possible for something like this to land up on my desk that was not – that was not correct.    Yes.    Yes.    No.  No.  It could have been drafted by somebody from Mr Singh that did not put their name.  There – it did not reflect that it had been recommended by anyone else but the fact that Mr Singh had recommended it was sufficient for me.  In any way if it came to me with Mr Singh’s recommendation and that is what I looked at.    Hm.    CDB loan yes.    OEM’s.    Yes.    Yes    No Makgatho    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Were in China?    When she was in – oh when she returned yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Again Mr Myburgh you started the story right in the middle and went to the end to paint a particular picture.      You started it.    Yes.  I do not know for what end but the story is that there was ongoing disagreements between Mathane Makgatho and Anoj Singh.  Mathane Makgatho and I had worked at the Treasury.  She reported to me at the Treasury when I was a Deputy Director General Assets and Liability Management.    Yes.    When I was Deputy Director General Assets and Liability Management she was Chief Director responsible for foreign funding.  I have huge respect and knowledge of the international capital market as well as risk management and structure and the bond market.  She – her knowledge is very superior.  She came to me to complain before this incident about two times about Eric Wood and Anoj Singh and their proposal.  And on both occasions I said to her okay I hear you I will deal with it.  And on both occasions I followed her advice.  I did not do what Anoj Singh and Eric Wood had been proposing,  but when it came to this, there was a big debate.  I saw Mathane separately and I saw Anoj separately.  And they both presented their cases.  Chair, when you are doing a transaction like this, there are numerous views about how to approach it.  And Mathane had a view, Anoj had a view.  And Anoj... The advisors that were advising Anoj on the transaction with Eric Wood and Neville Pillay.  And my feeling about that was that... thousand ideas... let us get more ideas.  There is no harm in getting different perspectives.  And Matane disagreed...   And instead of just dismissing what she was saying.  I called a meeting which happened – to have     I wanted to be like...  I wanted to be like you.     [laughs]  Since you are the only one who is holding this position.  Are you prepared to say their position which is held by these three is something that you could go along with?       Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes. ADV MYBURGH     Yes.     Yes.     It was her view and ...[intervenes]      Yes.  The only thing that I did not do and which maybe may have resulted in being misunderstood was that I never chastised Mr Singh in front of Ms Mathane(?).     I never chastised Mr Singh in front of Ms Mathane.       So I never in the presence of both said to Mr Singh you are wrong and she is right.  And even when she came to me, I never spoke bad about Mr Singh because Mr Singh was her boss.  He was her superior.   And what I – the advice that I gave to Mr Singh is that you must take the disagreements on your staff very seriously.  Listen to them.  And please, I do not want this thing that your staff disagree with you and you are having to come to me on conditions where your staff disagrees with you.   This was a private conversation that I had with Mr Singh.  Please make sure that you sort out your house so that when you come to me you come with one position.  But because of the disagreement, Ms Mathane’s concerns, none of the structures that came that she objected to was implemented at...     258?     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes?     Yes.  So he wanted me to take a side.     Ja.  So I did not approve it.     I just noted ...[intervenes]      ...that that is his position.       Yes.     Ja, actually, she is also not correct.  I did not take her side.  That is what my – what my noted...  I did not take a side.  So I did not...  Me saying noted, I was not taking a side because my advice to Anoj has always     Yes, ja.     Ja, except that it is not called a regime in the literature(?) style, management style.  Management style.  So my management style is collaborative.     Collaborative means we do not suppress views irrespective of from how junior the person may...  but why we do not suppress views, you acknowledge that the executives that these people report to, if you like ego’s(?), and that you...   So you have to find a way of accepting a view from a subordinate in a manner that does not create tensions in the organisation with the superior.  So it must be collaborative.   And Chair, I did not care how long it takes.  I had resolved that they have to find each other ...[intervenes]      ...and come with a common position.     They have to find it.     And they were not finding each other.     Ja.  And I did not implement ...[intervenes]      ...any of their propositions.     I agree that at some point I would have had to make a decision.     We are not in a crisis.     Ja.  So it had to be collaborative.     And so...  Ja, in fact, when you read through her ...[intervenes]      ...affidavit.  You will see that there were tensions.  There were tensions.     ...sensitive to that.     But I must repeat Chair that I did respect Ms Mathane Makgatho...     It is just that the situation that if she had been reporting to me and came with those structures ...[intervenes]      ...and I would also – and one of her subordinates had disagreed with her, I would have asked her to go back ...[intervenes]      ...until there is a ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.     Ja, I will not express an opinion on that agreement but, ja, after I had left then it went in a particular direction.     Yes.     I had left and perhaps it is up to the board and Mr Singh and the people that signed the agreement to come and put their case ...[intervenes]      ...as to why they thought it was in the interest of the company.     No.  That is why – I did not see it as a Regiment’s thing.      I saw it as a disagreement by professionals ...[intervenes]      ...on how to structure a particular role with the China Development Bank.  And I also acknowledge that the China Development Bank...  You see,  Mr Makgatho and myself, we did transactions for the National Treasury.   We funded the fiscus on international capital markets and domestic capital markets but we always funded the fiscus from loans sourced from the Western world, from Europe, from the United States and sometimes we ventured into Canada and then we did Japanese loans.   There we were very good.  We understood how that works.  The US financial market, the... markets, the institutions and the US, how they work.       When I went to China to have a meeting with the CDB, I discovered that actually they were...  And even as I was leaving the Treasury, sourcing funds from China was a new thing.  There were some several markets that were different than what we were used to. One of them was China and the other one was Suko(?), which is an Islamic – I think it is Islamic roles(?) with no interest.  So we were exploring these as a – I do not want to use the word exotic but as alternative sources of funding but that are very different from what we used to. So even in this disagreement, I was aware that, well, you know, part of the problem is that the CBD operates slightly different from a multi-lateral institutions in the Western world.       Yes.     Is this ...[intervenes]      Not particularly.  I mean, I never look back at what was happening but in the context of the Commission, yes, it appears that is what happened but when I had left Transnet, I did not try and do anything from the...     Yes.     Yes...     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     On reflection Chair, I think that perhaps where I failed Ms Mathane.  Maybe what I should have said to her was, when we go to the meeting at Melrose Arch, bring two people with you that agree with you because then she can now argue that it was loaded against...  Maybe she felt that way although that was not the intention.   The intention was to have a mature adult debate about this loan but perhaps on reflecting and on reading Mr Mohammed’s comments, I felt that perhaps I should have asked her to bring two people that agree with her so that we can have a proper debate.  That did not, unfortunately, happened but...   Yes, it is one of the regrets that I have.  Maybe that is what I should have allowed to have happened at the time. However, the disadvantage of that is that Mr Mohammedi worked in the Treasury and was even – was reporting to Ms Makgatho.   So that would have – I mean, that would have, like, being bringing two people that are two or three levels below Mr Singh to come and argue with him.  Sometimes that does not build...  It is not that he is assertive.  She would have stood her ground.   But, ja, maybe I should have said she can bring two people but then at the same time, sometimes people when the GC is present, the CFO and the Treasurer and there is an argument, either just freeze and keep quiet.  They do not want to take sides against anyone of those people because...   Ja, which is another reason why I feel that the evidence that you get from people that are still at Transnet and Eskom, you must treat it in that context Chair that they feel like if they do not say what they think the Commissions wants to hear, they may lose their jobs.   Ja, I am aware that there a lot of people that are seen as Brian Molefe-people that were... because they were – they may – most people have not done anything, really.  They were very professional people.   Unfortunately, they left.  They had to leave because I have been painted as by the Public Protector as somebody who was potentially corrupt and so it had a rippled effect on innocent people whose mission in life was just to look after their families.       What was his view again?     No, I cannot comment on it Chair.     Because it is a debate that happened after I left.     H’m.  Is that here in the Commission?     Ja, I have experienced how the Commission and wants to make you say things that you feel at some point you are compelled to say just to get out of the situation.  Unfortunately, it is not all of us that are assertive.  So I would say that...   I mean, especially if you are still working at Transnet.  Coming across a person like Mr Myburgh who says you knew and he knows that this means that – it could mean that he is going to lose his job.  Then he will say anything.   So I will take what he said with – well, not a tablespoon, just a pinch of salt and say that do not – and say that be careful to interpret that as an honest statement.  We do not know what his real honest statement would have been if you remove the circumstances that he finds himself in.       Saying what?     Ja, I am just saying that Mr Mohammedi may have been influenced by other factors.     Yes.  So it may well be his true feeling but I am just saying discount it and know that I know that there are a lot of people that have come here and said things that I know they would normally not say...  It is like...  They call it a fishpond thing.  It is like a fish in a pond that is aware that it is being watched.  He behaves differently...       Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Because...  You want to know why?     Because, actually, going through those 3.3. Notices, I cannot recall, I may be wrong, but I cannot recall anyone implicating me in wrongdoing.  In wrongdoing.  None of them implicated me in wrongdoing.   And this morning when I came in here, I was listening to an application to cross-examine and I was listening to the criteria that the Chairperson was using that in – the Chairperson is in a hurry to finish.   So if nobody has implicated me in wrongdoing, there was – then there is no need for me to come and waste the Chairperson’s time.     There was just once that mister...  I got an instruction from the Chairperson to respond to Mr Jabu Mabuza.  Mr Jabu Mabuza who did not know what he was talking about, who had no idea what had been happening there and I responded to his, I think it is a Section 10 something notice that I got.     Was it a 10.6 Directive?     My response, the other day I submitted was very, very brief.  And I never heard anything from the Commission after that.  Even when we were – even my cross ...[intervenes]      On the Eskom evidence.     His evidence was not referred to at all, just like Ms Madonsela’s evidence was not referred to in the Eskom...     So nobody...  I cannot recall that anybody implicated me in wrongdoing.     I cannot recall that anyone of them implicated me in wrongdoing.  Ja, they talked about me.  I mean, I have got a 3.3. relating to Mr Pravin Gordhan who said that Mr Brian Molefe thought that the nuclear deal could be funded.  Of course I did.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  It could be funded.   He had to be corrected by Mr Pretorius in this     No, what I am saying is.  No, my – I mean, like, in the ...[intervenes]      Ja, in this home, house.     Ja, this hall is not a house.     It is the people that...  Yes.     Look, I mean, I cannot be categoric in answering that question or be absolute but generally, as a matter of style, I prefer to be collaborative.     Yes.     Yes.     I cannot recall that I had needed an instruction to be executed urgently.     Yes.     You say the Regiments will facilitate a five year R5 billion loan?  Yes.     No, what I could not recall was that I had said it must be executed urgently.      Yes.     Yes.     No, I do not recall that there was such an instruction from myself.     Yes.     I do but I wish you could jump to paragraph 83 and just leave all the drama and go to paragraph 83.     Oh, okay.     No, no comment.     Yes, yes, I remember that discussion.     Yes.     Which is why I was asking you to go to paragraph 83 and leave all the drama.     Yes.     Yes, Chair, the bottom line is that I agree with her.     That the structure was never implemented.     I just said I …[intervenes]     I have said to you I have no recollection of asking anyone to implement a structure in one day.  I am not sure where it comes from.     Come again?     In one day, yes.     Yes, to execute.  I mean, this was a request to execute in one day.     ...was prepare the memorandum and execute.     Perhaps it is myself who is maybe mistaken, Chair, but my recollection is that she came to my office …[intervenes]     Yes.     But I do note that she does say that I said  to her that the structure should not be supported.     Was it?     Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, her evidence says it was Regiments’ proposal.     I do not recall, Chair.     No, it depends on what it is.     So the capital amount is at 750 million, maybe marching on 2 basis points.     Two basis points is .002%.     Times 750, 35 million, thereabouts.     No, no I …[intervenes]     Yes.     Maybe that is the impression that was created.     For her, to her.  I remember her bursting into my office and say this cannot be done and so on and so forth and I said what is it and then she explained to me and I said do not worry, I will not support that structure.     Well, I say I do not recall asking for anything like that.     Yes, yes.     Well – yes, yes.     No, it was not my proposal.     You have to canvass with Mr Singh.     No, it does not.     No.  No, it does not.     If I had said to her we must do it.     Because it was never done.  Paragraph 83.     It does not reflect on me because I do not recall such a …[intervenes]     I deal with the evidence of Ms Makgatho .     In my affidavit, I cannot recall what I say     I do not know whose proposal it was, Chair, I have no recollection of the origin or where this thing came from.  All I remember is Ms Makgatho  coming into my office very irate, explaining to me what was about to happen that there is a structure that needs to be done in one day and saying that it is just never done and I said do not worry, I will not support it.     No.  She said Mr Singh, she said …[intervenes]     But she said – that is her evidence.     Ja, ja, ja, ja.     It was – the person that she spoke to was Mr Singh.  I do not know what is the point of your semantics.     I say I do not know what is the point of your semantics.     Ms Makgatho  spoke to Mr Singh about this structure.     Yes.     Well, let me just say I do not know whose proposal it was then.     I do not know – to have such a proposal, to make such a proposal?  I do not know.     Mr Singh was her superior.     Not to my knowledge.     To tell you the truth, I did not apply my mind to this, it was just a something that was just not going to happen in one day.     Yes.     No …[intervenes]     Well, her evidence, paragraph 81, says she had lost patience with Anoj Singh and Eric Wood.  So it those two people that she had a discussion with.     She said she had been in a discussion with Anoj Singh and Eric Wood.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     What is this document, by the way?  Is it their bid.     It is a bid document?     Yes.     No, no, I never see …[intervenes]     350 does not have – 351.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I never saw bid documents.     But do you have the contracts?     I knew nothing about?     Yes.     Yes.     I want to take you to the confinements.  So we have four contracts, four confinements, coal, Kumba, Manganese and NMPP.  Could I ask you to turn firstly to page – and these are the typed page numbers, PSV1283.       This goes on to 838.     Little d for Delta?      [no audible response]        Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes. ADV MYBURGH     What do you mean it’s a different type of confinement?     Yes, but it’s not a different type of confinement it’s just…[intervenes].     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     So, the issue is urgency or the advisability of revenue risk.     Yes.     To be quite honest here I am thoroughly confused. The names that you were talking about earlier but, by the way, I think it’s in [d].     Yes, but the first one, what page was it, 1273?     1283?     What’s the qualification?     Ja.     If you look at the first one, 1283, and you go to page 185 and paragraph 26 dealing with the grounds for confinement it says, “Appended below for ease of reference...[intervenes].     26.     “Appended below for ease of reference is.  an extract from the current procurement procedures manual which sets out the grounds for confinement”, And it has ground A, B, C and D and then over the page it says, “We are of the view that this matter complies with grounds A and D as set out below and specific emphasis is placed on ground A and D due to the potential business risks associated with approaching the market on an open tender process as well as the credentials listed above, And then in paragraph 28 there’s a table there that sets out confinement considerations.  So, I’m not sure which of these in these memoranda that – or even in this memorandum that Mr Volmink specifically found offensive.     Yes, because I can only go with the memo that was presented to me and not Mr Volmink’s subsequent interpretation.     Yes, the memo presented to me has grounds for confinement, paragraph 25 to 29 so I wonder if there is any of these paragraphs that Mr Volmink considered offensive.     Yes, because it sets out what are the grounds for confinement, it actually quotes verbatim the procurement procedure manual and then it says, which of the grounds in the procurement procedure manual are applicable.     Which is A and D and then it goes on to take the grounds for confinement as per the procurement procedure manual and then gives in tabular form the confinement considerations.  I mean I can go through everything and read it as it is in the memo.     Yes.     63?     Yes.     Yes.     143?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Please go on to read 148?     Please go on to read 148?     Yes, no, not my point was – or it could be done in terms of the 2013 PPM but also if you look at the footnote, on page 64, Mr Volmink says, “The 2013 version of the PPM applied to the McKinsey confinement”.     Yes.     Yes.     If you go to the memo, itself, in the memo it says that the …[intervenes].     1286.     Ja, it says, “We are of the view that …[intervenes]”.     1286, paragraph 27.     “We are of the view that this matter.  complies with grounds A and D as set out below and the request for confinement is therefore fully supported”.     Now, E in page 1285 says, “When goods or services being procured are highly specialised and largely identical with those previously executed by that supplier and it is not in the interest of the public or the organisation to solicit other tender offers as it would result in wasted money and/or time for transfer.  When this particular ground is intended to be used as a ground for confinement it is important to note that all pre-requisites must be satisfied.  That is, the goods or services must be highly specialised, almost identical”. And then, in paragraph 28 at the bottom in the table, “Any new service provider would have to develop its own methodologies and tools as well as obtain operational experience within a coal …[indistinct] environment.  Due to the specialised nature of the work, the new service provider will be required to understand the intricacies of Transnet’s operations, capital programme and overall NDS”.      Those are the reasons I could advance.     But it’s supplied in there,  “The specialised nature of the work, the new service provider will be required to understand the intricacies of Transnet’s operations, capital programme and overall…[intervenes]”.     No, the question is, did I understand that, at the time.     Of understanding Mr Myburgh, please be patient with me.     No, I don’t think that was necessary because I was explaining.     No, Mr Myburgh interjected as I was answering and said, did you.     And I felt that, that was not necessary.     My understanding is that in terms of this memo that was put forward to me the reasons – the grounds for the confinement were stated and the grounds for the confinement referred specifically to the procedure procurement manual, paragraph 16.1.2 and that they were elaborated on and I saw nothing untoward at the time of signing.  So, when Mr Volmink, exposed afterwards, says that no it did not cover confidentiality sufficiently, well I must say that that was not a concern that I had at the time.  The fact of the matter is that the grounds for confinement are in paragraphs 25, 28 and at the time of signing this memorandum I had no issues with the grounds that were advanced, in fact I felt they were sufficiently articulated.     I approve everything by myself.     After recommendation.     Ja. ADV MYBURGH     No, but Chair when he does the same you must also tell him to let me finish.     Yes, I think it will be better if we address the Chair.     Yes.     Yes.    No I do not agree with you.    That there was an absence of confidentiality.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Chairperson if we go to Mr Volmink’s – Volmink’s affidavit.    If you go to Mr Volmink’s affidavit.    It is on…    Exhibit BB2.1(a).    A – A for apple.    Which page was that Mr …    No Mr Volmink’s affidavit.    He has visit before.    65.  Now Chairperson first look at the footnote 75 at the bottom of the page.    64- ESB006 – it says there 2013 version of the PPM applied to the McKinsey confinement.    Yes.    Ja.    And in paragraph 148 it says that 2013 PPM stated that in instances where or confinement is confidential a GCE may approve such confinement without the confinement request being rooted via any other authority.    Yes.    So it was possible to do what you were doing.    And – so the question becomes did we consider it – did we consider these confinements to be confidential?    And then I fail to…    Well these things…    Ja but it says without the confinement request being rooted via any other authority.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja it could have been a compiler, it could have recommended.    Or he could have compiled.    Yes.  Ja.    Yes.    Although it is a recommendation – oh ja okay let us just say even if it is not a recommendation.    So now the question becomes do these qualify from the point of confidentiality to be treated in the manner that the 2013 EPM     Envisaged – prescribed and what I said is – alright okay fine.  Now where are those things Mr Myburgh – oh here.  If you go to the memo the – the memo on PSB1286.    Yes PSB1286.  So if you look at 1286 in that table – PSB1286.    It is PSB1286.    BB2.1.d for Delta.    1286.     Now – so now we are trying to determine whether these things can be considered confidential.  So the second – the second block D – Goods and services being procured is highly specialised and largely identical.  Now the – on the right it deals with the speci – this specific case.  The left if what the procurement manual requires.  So there are bullet points there amongst them. “The skill requires specialised management skill in managing operations within a coal rail environment.  McKinsey has a proprietary coal demand and supply models as well as key operating philosophies that Transnet can use.  The tool is available from only one supplier that is McKinsey.  We have satisfied ourselves that there is no new entrant who can perform the work through the following manner. These philosophies and tools have been implemented and delivered.  Increases in volume tempo at desired levels in the past.  McKinsey has provided this type of service in the past to Transnet Freight Rail.  Any new service provider would have to develop its own methodologies and tools as well as obtain operational experience within a coal rail environment. Due to the specialised nature of the work a new service provider will be required to understand the intricacies of Transnet’s operations capital programs and overall market demand structures.” So what it is saying there is that McKinsey has done this work they have a proprietary ownership of the models that they have used.  A new entrant would either have to take Mc – use McKinsey's models or develop their own.  And then they would have to understand Transnet’s business operating model, capital program and overall MPA. I think that this satisfied the confidentiality.    Secret.    Oh about the memo?    Yes.    In this instance it was the proprietary coal demand and supply models.  I agree they were not in the memo but I understood – my understanding of confidentiality was that we are dealing with confidential Transnet information and in this instance the confidential information of McKinsey of the proprietary models of McKinsey.  So that is where in my understanding confidentially – confidentiality kicked in in this instance.  That was my understanding it may have been flawed but that is how I understood it at the time.    But the PPM said confidentiality.    It did not say within the organisation.    Ja.    No in this understanding I am saying my interpretation of confidentiality means the confidentiality of the tools and the information that a supplier would need to have.  So it is not confidentiality within the organisation but confidentiality in – as I understood it here confidentiality in as far as if other suppliers came in.    He is entitled to his view.    He is entitled to his view.    Sorry.    Ja it would appear that we have different views.    Yes.    Yes the reason for the confinement Chair is that where you cannot source the goods or services anywhere else then you can confine.    Let us take …    Ja that is just the confinement.    Ja so let us say that – let us say that the – the – what the required is a Mercedes Benz C Class you will not get it from BMW.  Now part of the reason you cannot get it from BMW is that Mercedes Benz has proprietary assets – proprietary knowledge of the Mercedes Benz C Class and that is secret.  That is confidential to them and therefore for reasons of confidentiality you cannot go out and say I would like for example Kentucky Fried Chicken with its secret recipe from everybody.    Yes.    Yes.    Well the PPM did not go that far.    So we can put away this one?    Bundle 5.      Yes.    Ja I may have been do you have the agreement.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    1315?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Before we close that if I may Chair?  I think the discussion of these contracts clearly show that the contracts were awarded in terms of Transnet policy and that I was involved in the award of the contracts and that there were clear recommendations for the award of the contracts and the grounds for the award of the contracts was clearly set out in the memorandums and that on the basis of what was presented in the memoranda for the award of the contracts they were awarded.  However what was not – was not shown was that I knew that part of the payments would go to Mr Essa or that there would be money laundering involved.  That has not been shown.  Or that I knew or intended that the contracts should be used for money laundering by Mr Essa.  It actually starts with the fact that I do not even know Mr Essa.  But – but I do not think it was shown in this exercises that I knew or intended that the – and so just to close the comment I also deny any suggestion that I knew or intended that these contracts would be used for money laundering or any other purpose other than what is contained in the memoranda that I have signed.    Can I just…    Yes.    6t h of December.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    My – my recollection was that it was before the 6t h.    The 6t h – before the tender was issued.    Yes.  But what actually happened the meeting was organised by the I think it was the Chinese Embassy and they said that there is a company that manufactures locomotives in China and they have never done any business with Transnet and that they would like to come to South Africa to have a meeting with Transnet to understand the Transnet’s business.  So they came quite a big delegation and they – they made a presentation about their company and they manufacture locomotives and who their clients are and so on and so forth.  At the beginning of course we made speeches about how the people of China and the people of South Africa have always worked together and the brothers and so on so it was a very nice diplomatic meeting.  And at the end of the meeting I said well if you are interested we will soon be having a tender for the acquisition of locomotives.  You are more than welcome to bid.  And I think that either Gary Peter was in that meeting or I must have said to him afterwards this company, maybe I did not even give him a profile - is interested in bidding for the 95 locomotives.  Please contact them because they did say that they are interested.       Yes.  Yes.  And I mean, that was in the MBS.     I think it was a few days before because Gary Pita says here in early December.     So it was maybe a few days before but it was definitely before.     Because I remember saying to them we will be going out to market very soon and if you really keen on starting to do business with us, maybe if you start by submitting a tender.     And Chairperson, encouraging people to submit a tender is not a bad thing because it improves the competitive tension in the tendering process.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  I think that, like I said, out of the – about mister..., this may be – this sentence may be a reflection of how they would have put in Chinese but not to write it in English, to say that...  Ja, I do not know.  We are interested in this.     Any assistance would be welcome.  Or something like that but it is not elegant.     It is a reflection of a...  It is something that is done by people who are second or third or fourth language, English speakers like myself.     Yes.     Come again?     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I think that letter was a – may or may have been a request to visit our facilities, our TFR facilities.  And all I did was to send it to Mr Gama firstly because he is the Group Executive for TFR. And secondly.  In this, people who are bidding, the bids were being evaluated from TFR and so they will deal with the fact that if this guy is a bidder and is making contact, what are the implications. So I did not do anything with this letter other than to forward it to TFR for them to deal with as they see appropriately.  And what I did was to inform them that is what I did.     I do not know ...[intervenes]      So we are done with this one?     [No audible reply]      There was an approved Business Case for confinement to Mars.     Mars is Mitsui.     Yes.     Oh, either one.  As long as you understand that we are talking about Mitsui.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, you see, Mr Callard was the author of the Business Case for the confinement of 100 locomotives.     [No audible reply]  ADV MYBURGH     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Callard ...[intervenes]      Well, before you are going to ask your question.  Mr Callard says that he did not know about the confinement to CSR.  And I have, firstly - and the reasons for the confinement to CSR.  Firstly, I have documents here Chairperson that I got also in the course of the last one or two days.     I said, firstly, I have a few documents here that I got in the last – in the course of the last ...[intervenes]      In the course of the last one or two days.     Ja, I have got some more documents with me.     And these are documents – and these are -- and these I have not seen before but somebody who is at Transnet came to me.     And said that I am aware ...[intervenes]      ...Mr Callard is saying that he did not know about the confinement for the 100 and the reasons for not confining to Mitsui.  But these are reports from engineers that detailed the failures of the Mitsui locomotives over a period of time. In fact, what this guy was telling me was that the train drivers and the engineers on the coal line were relieved but eventually did not confine to Mitsui.  And these are letters and emails to Mars to the – Mr Ravi Nair, acting Chief Executive of Transnet Freight Rail...     Chairperson ...[intervenes]      I do not have copies.     But I do not mind parting with these copies.     Because after today, if somebody says Transnet to me...     But what ...[intervenes]      ...there is that ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      Yes.     Come again?     Ja.  That is Mr Jiyane as well.     Did you say he writes to Mr Jiyane?     That is Mr Jiyane.       No, I just saw it recently.       [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes.     The same misinformed concern.     I say, the same misinformed concern.     [Indistinct] I met Mr Jiyane socially somewhere and he said to me that the Commission is refusing that he comes and gives evidence.     Yes.  Those were his words.     He said    He said the Commission.  I do not know who it is but ...[intervenes]      No, he showed me correspondence from – before he left Transnet.     From an acting Group Chief Executive, not the current one, but the guy who was acting before.  I cannot remember his name.     Email, which specifically forbid him to come to the Commission.     From Transnet.  But also on his own volition, he made contact with the Commission.     And was given a cold shoulder.     And Mr Jiyane(?), Chair, was at the centre of these locomotive’s acquisition.     He was quite central.     He is the person that the newspapers – or Mr Popo Molefe in his evidence here said that he replaced somebody with 17-years’ experience with a teacher.  Mr Jiyane is that guy who is called the teacher.   He started off as a teacher but ended up with two degrees in business.  So it was not correct for Mr Popo Molefe to say that a teacher replaced the Chief Executive of Transnet Rail Engineering. That was Mr Jiyane. I think it is key and should be listened to by the Commission if you really want to know what happened to the locomotives’ acquisitions.     Mr Gary Pita ...[intervenes]      I will give him your cell phone number Chair because the Secretary is not very helpful because he has issues.  I think it has to do with the fact that he once lost a tender and lost a court case.     [Indistinct]      To Mr Myburgh?     Chairperson?     We really thank you for the offer and we will make use of this offer.     We will contact Mr Jiyane and compile all the information relay it to Mr Myburgh.     And... the Secretary of the Commission.     Thank you very much.     I think from reading this.     Yes.     Yes.     Mr Gama?     No, the engineers are the experts.     Mr Gama was like me, he was a Chief Executive.  He was just an overhead expenditure like me. ADV MYBURGH     ...were doing the work.  The experts are the train drivers and the engineers.     No, Mr Callard was not an expert.     Except the people that wrote those letters that say that the Mitsui locomotives were failing on the coal line.     Mr Callard, Chairperson, is also conflicted because he works for MNS, I think Fuluzi or MNS.  He was hired by MNS in – as part of their forensic investigation.  And I think in the process of this Commission, he was at pains to explain or to show how useful he could be to the MNS people but he was a hired hand.  He is missionary(?).    Yes.     On the?      Yes.      Yes.      I cannot remember why Mr Gama did not sign.      FQC228?      Yes.      Yes.      I cannot remember that they were, but like I say, raised by who?      I say were they raised by whom?    No, those emails were not me.     No, no.  I cannot remember that they were.     FQC12?    Yes, the Chinese had a heavy hall locomotive that in fact was even above the standards that were required.  So that is not correct and I even have a model of bad locomotive.  So that locomotive did exist.    The Chinese manufacturing facilities would be used, because manufacturing these locomotives in China would give us the hundred locomotives very quickly.  On the coal mine, which was in dire straits because the coal producers, so this takes us back to what I had said in the Eskom stream, because the coal producers had been complaining that their coal is not being taken to Richards bay. So we said we can get the locomotives very quickly, but you have to sign take or pay agreements and then there was an incident with Glenco and secondly the GFB, because we would take one hundred locomotives from the GFB from the coal mine GFB to revise the GFB business. So the GFB business required the locomotives and in as far as I am concerned, the confinement was in compliance with the procurement procedure model.    Yes.     I do not know.  Maybe, I do not know.  I do not know what he was, what it was that he was going to explain to him, but I suspect it may be what I have just told you now.     Because they were failing, number one.  Number two, there had apparently been several confinements to them.  There had been confinements to them in the past and a view had been expressed that we should try not to have existing suppliers that have been supplying locomotives.  So they had won the tender quite a few years back and there had been a few confinements in between, and so there was a concern that we would be entrenching monopolies.  Yes, those are the words.  Entrenching monopolies by using suppliers that won a tender a few years ago and then we just mandate creep or scope creep. Every time we need locomotives we just confine to them.      Yes.      Yes.      Yes, when ...[intervenes]     On the same grounds.     Because what we needed, was a hundred locomotives.     Entrenching monopolies.     I cannot remember but it was in the context of the BADC.      Might have been awarded.    But subsequent to that, and this I had forgotten.  There had been complaints that the Motsui locomotives had been failing and I had actually forgotten that until I was reminded.    Okay.    From?      Okay.      Yes.     No, what I remember is that the base price of the locomotive was 28 million per locomotive.  That was the base price of the locomotive.    Now the thing about locomotives, depending on where you buy them, is that there are other costs and the other costs include the, the lifetime cost of the locomotive, which is a cost of maintenance and maintaining it or the lifetime. But also the cost of financing as well as the costs of hedging the purchase price of the locomotives.  So in this instance and in the other instances as well, our preference was to get a fixed price.  Fixed price means irrespective of what happens, there is exchange rates to interest rates and to inflation. This is the price that we will pay.  So if we are not entering into a contract where after a few, a few years or even a few months a supplier will turn around and say you know that the price three months ago.  Since then the price of steel has gone up, interest rates, differential between the countries.   Our countries is widened and that the exchange rate as you can see has moved.  So we prefer the fixed price.  Now when you go for fixed price, typically the suppliers would make you pay for it, and this differed and was a subject of negotiation.   So the important thing is to know that the base price was 28 million and then the other fields put it up and those other fields would differ depending on where you buy.  You are buying from China and buying from Japan and buying from America is not, the thrills are not the same.     But what was comparable is the base price.    According to mister?    Lehur.     Yes.     46?      Yes.     Yes.     Yes, by Mr Gama and Mr Singh.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.      Yes, I may have seen it in the papers, yes.     Both from MNS?      No.      Come again, which ...[intervenes]     Ja.  Which page number?      What is the page number?    100 001?      Yes.  Yes, I have got it.     I cannot say that I have, but ...[intervenes]     Yes.      Ja, yes.     He is talking rubbish.      Yes, let me come to why I say that.  Chairperson, if you look at the memorandum in RESP049,    Yes.     No Chair.  We were in class when the lecturer demonstrated this, and he took a wine glass.    And he filled it with tic-tacs, small sweets and we were about 15 in class, and he says please walk around this wine glass and estimate the number of sweets, and write down your estimate.  From 15 people, the range valued from about 75 to 400.   He says that is your lecture for the day on estimation.      It does not mean anything, because what you do not know is what is in fact the wine glass.     Yes.     Mr Tjabi is an expert?    Is he expert to you?  I mean, I do not consider his work to be the work of an expert.     Yes.     Yes.     That is what I am saying.  I am saying that the estimation is an art, not a science.  So Mr Tjabi cannot come here with definite numbers when all he did was estimate.     No.     Yes.     Bundle 5, yes.     Yes.     One four?    Yes.    Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No, I do not.     No, I do not.  I think that it was an error Chairperson.     And please, remember that this was the 20 t h, the 12 t h day of November 2020 and this notice required us or me to deal with this, with all of these issues within seven weeks, and then on the same day there was another directive that said that, which was an Eskom directive, which required me to deal with quite substantial issues within 30 days.  On top of that Chairperson, I am actually a student.  It was in the middle of my exams.  If I put away all of these directives, and finished my exams, then I was under pressure to finish the 30 day directive.  I even think I asked for an extension. While I was still busy dealing with it, there was a subpoena to appear on the 15 t h of January.  The subpoena came with its own issues and the 15 t h of January was about the same time as, as this affidavit was due.  So there was a lot of pressure and what I did is I dealt with it to the best of my ability, and I must apologise if in the process I may have neglected to deal with the McKinsey issues.  However, having said that, I would hope that my dealing with the issues today, was ...[intervenes]     Give them justice, yes.  I hope that we dealt with them adequately and that there is nothing that I have said today that I would not have said, had I had sufficient time to prepare and finalize my affidavit properly.    I think I did not deal with it because I did not have time.     But as you may have noticed from the way that I have dealt with it today, had I had time to deal with it, I would have dealt with it exactly as I dealt with it today.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No.    I have no comment, other than to say that price was not the reason why we did not go for Motui as I said.     No, I have no comment.     Yes.     I cannot quite recall exactly who it was.     I cannot quite recall exactly who it was.     It could have been.    5.6.4.20?    And I would also presume that he was not the only one.     Ja, I cannot recall why I would not have signed it, and perhaps ...[intervenes]     Because, because the standard practice is that if I do not approve, I say so.  That it is not approved.  So if something is brought, I either approve or I do not approve or as in the case of that memo with Ms Makgatho, I say noted or I make a comment.  But that I did not even express an opinion or sign at all, I cannot recall what the reason was.    I cannot recall that this was discussed in the formal meeting and I cannot recall who raised it.  I do recall something like this, but I remember just thinking that look, this is not something that we should involve ourselves in, and that we need to decide whether we are going with Motui or not, and we have to find reasons why we are not going with Motui if we are not going with Motui and why we could go with CSI. Ja, I just remember vaguely this allegation and I cannot recall that it was in the formal meeting.  So I do not know if it is in the minutes or whether it was raised on the side of the meeting, but there was I think in the township    Gossip yes, gossip.      It is not even saying here who raised that issue.      Yes.     Sorry, where are you reading?  Which paragraph?    124?    Who said this?    Well, I was never a part of talking about that secret deal.    Yes.     I cannot comment on that.     No, I cannot comment on that.  I, ja I cannot comment on that.     Well, the minutes would reflect exactly what happened at the meeting.    Well, ja.  This is now become stranger than fiction.  So there was a memorandum that I did not sign, that never the less …[audio cut] BADC is that – I do not know is that what happened because if I had not signed it it could not have gone to BADC and if it did it would have been irregular. And as I have said before that memorandum was not signed and it did not indicate whether I disapproved or approved or had reservations.  I did not give reasons.  A normal practice would have been for me to sign but then indicate, bring the matter to finality one way or another.    So – so if it was a memorandum that I had not signed it is a memorandum that does not exist.    Yes.    Yes.      So whilst it was determined that we are not going through Mitsui with Mitsui as I say the business case did not change.  So the business case for getting 100 locomotives for the coal line was still there and so the reasons were still the same.    I – I cannot comment on that.    Well the – the paragraph before says that it was the same as the Mitsui memorandum.    So the business case for the 100 locomotives.    It comes from TFR.    Ja it was a change in the party.    And not in the …    I think it was between myself and Mr Singh.      Yes.    No the origin – well – well maybe …    We do not understand each other because …     Ja.  Ja the memorandum for Mitsui was a – a motivation.    For the acquisition.    That came from TFR.  In that sense it originated from TFR.    Yes.      And that is what I am saying here.    Yes.    Yes.    So now Mr …    I forget your name now.    Myburgh.    Yes.      Yes, yes.  As I say over the weekend I got things that jogged my memory and these are reports from engineers.    I said as I say that I got things that jogged my memory and these are reports that came from the engineers that the Mitsui amongst others – the Mitsui locomotives had been failing.  But this was 2000 and – 2000 – was it 2013?    14 the tender had been awarded in 2010 and between – for fourteen years in between there had been confinements.    No it was not 2010 it was – it happened for quite a long time.    Yes I made a mistake.    It was before that.  It was before 2010.  But for quite a number of years and I cannot remember exactly when it was awarded I can find that out.  For quite a number of years the – the tender had been awarded quite a long time ago and in between there had been confinements.  Ja so there was this issue of entrenched monopoly number 1 and number 2 the locomotives had been failing.   Yes.    Yes I cannot comment on that.  That is what Gama said.    I cannot…    Ja I cannot comment on that.  Is that what Jiyane says?    Ja I cannot comment on that.    Yes.    Yes.    It is possible but I cannot comment on it.  I cannot say for sure that that was indeed the case.    Yes.    Well this is not them saying it.    No this is not them saying it.    It is – it is – who was it?  MNS.    Saying that they said so.    Yes.  So I would rather that they come here and say so.    So let us wait for their evidence.    Because – because what – I think because this is what – what MNS says they said.    No I would rather that I – I am not accused of things.    In the interest of time.    No that…    No just saying that – well Mr Gama was the CEO of TFR and he did not know about it.    Now I must comment on it and as I say I cannot but Mr Gama will come here and he will have an opportunity to find out exactly what …    If Mr Gama repeats this and confirms it as true then it is fine then I can come back and answer to it.     Well that is something that would have been internal to Mr Gama.     It is difficult for me to say.  And he is the best person placed to talk about that.    As I say we have reports here that say that the locomotives were failing.    Oh sorry what was your question?    Ja.    No I think – I think there was a discussion.  We felt that the fact that we were not going to get the Mitsui locomotives and that the TFR people were happy with the Mitsui locomotives we would put the market demand strategy at risk.  I was explaining yesterday to the Chairperson that the – the funding of the MDS 70% of it had to come from operations – from improved operations.  This exercise would have improved the volumes and operations by injecting 100 locomotives and into the coal line improving the efficiency of the coal line and taking the old coal line locomotives and putting them onto the GFB business and improving volumes and generating revenue of to fund the MDS.   So in deciding on the confinement we had to do something that was practical and that could work.  The fact that we were going to buy a re-confined to an entrenched monopoly and when there had been reports that the locomotives are failing may not have helped our case. So the concern was to move with speed so that we can improve the operations of the business and generate the money that we need for the MDS. The MDS was not just about rail I see the commission’s concern is just rail but there were – the MDS included the ports, it included the pipelines, it included a project to manufacture our own locomotive that would be made in South Africa.  In – in business – in – not business development but in technology development at CSIR so we needed the money desperately to make the MDS a reality. And I remember having this meeting with Mr Singh and saying we must just decide and move on.    Yes.    Oh it did not.    What was it about?    Yes.    No.    My answer was it was a discussion and I gave you the context.    Did you say – when I – when I had a discussion with Singh did I talk about Gama?    Yes.    Yes.    Oh.    Shared with – ja.    No I cannot recall that – I cannot recall that we did that.    5.6.9.3?    Yes.    Yes I think…    I think that this is what MNS is saying about Jiyane and I would rather that he comes here and explains.    Chairperson Jiyane would have to come here and on this one I am quite confident that he would disagree with MNS that this is what he said.    Yes.    I would rather Jiyane and Gama answer when they come here and …    Yes.    Ja Chairperson this may have been an oversight on our side.    On – on the – the need for the locomotives had been determined.    Ja.    This is the 2013 PPM.   Ja it may well have said so but as we discussed earlier it also said other things.    Come again.    Ja it could have been an oversight but now reading this if the reliance was on the 2013 PPM what I am saying is that MNS is quoting this part of the PPM but not – does not quote the sections that we were dealing with earlier of the PPM that allowed for exactly what happened in the end.    Yes.    Yes.    That was in the 2013 PPM.    As we discussed it.    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.    Ja and then…    Ja perhaps Chairperson that technicality could be sustained.    Yes.    Yes Chairperson I have a request and my request is that I am really exhausted.    And..    And I do not think that I will do the 1064 justice if we could …    Yes.    Yes Chairperson especially that last night.    I have to stay up and read the documents.    Yes I also prefer to finish with Mr Myburgh. 
MYBURGH: So just that we can move on …[intervenes]   Thank you, Chair. Mr Molefe …[intervenes] 
ADV MASUKU SC:   Chairperson?     As I understand it, Mr Molefe does not have any problem with the hearing – the notes that he had last night for the purpose of this hearing.     I do not know why should it be difficult for this hearing to accord him the opportunity to refer to the notes because he is prepared to share these notes with …[intervenes]     Chairperson.     Can I just once more, just put it on record so that if it is possible, we can be able to move on.       Mr Molefe has already said yesterday and today.  He has never met Mr Essa, he does not know Mr Essa.  So, whatever Mr Myburgh may be having against Mr Essa cannot in any way be imputed to Mr Molefe, that is number one.  Number two, Chair I want to request that the Mr Molefe should be given an opportunity to testify freely in this Commission, he should not be interrogated and we have observed this from yesterday.   Firstly, he was patronised on a few occasions and he had to bring this to the attention of the Commission.  And secondly, it is as if his in an interrogation room, I thought the purpose of this proceedings is to get information and the witness should be able to do so freely, he should not be harassed when he has to give answers in this Commission, that is our request.     No, that is clear Chairperson as long as ultimately Mr Molefe is not going to feel intimidated.     But how questions are also posed to him is very important, because if he feels attacked, then he is going to respond in a particular way and I think we need to get to that point. 
ADVOCATE FOR MOLEFE:    Chairperson.      Chairperson, the record will reflect that, Chairperson he said he knew. 
MOLEFE: No but Mr – Mr Thomas says the memorandum did not reach me.  In fact he says he – it never reached Mr Singh or myself.  So yes he wrote that memorandum and in fact maybe if I had seen it at the time I may have reconsidered the decision that I had taken.  But the fact of the matter is that I do not know why you are – you are leaving paragraph 25 – 2.5.15 of the MNS Report where he says Mr E Thomas could not confirm whether Mr G Peter shared the memorandum with Mr A Singh and Mr B Molefe.   That had been made to me in the memorandum of the revenue sharing of the remuneration was that there had been savings of R2.8 billion and that those savings were not – were over and above what was required to be done.   So if you say to me that the – well that was part of the deliverables then you are then suggesting that those representations to me were misrepresentations which at the time is not something I was not doubting anybody’s bona fide’s at the time.   But I felt at that point had not ...[intervenes]      Ja.  The only 10.6 Directive was Mr Mabuza.  It was very surprising because Mr Mabuza’s   I cannot recall. Maybe you can ...[intervenes]    I do not know, my understanding …[intervenes]   Well, Mr Singh would because …[intervenes]   No, the people that recommend…[intervenes].   Their understanding was that he confinement to CSR was for a GFB locomotive and not a heavy haul locomotive.  And in fact, Mr Callard may have implied that CSR does not have the capacity to manufacture a heavy haul locomotive but CSR did have that capacity to manufacture the – a heavy haul locomotive. In fact, the heavy haul locomotives that they manufactured were much, much more powerful for our requirements that were in operation in China.  And also, the speed with which they could manufacture the locomotives, I mean, I – their production line is very impressive in how they can turn locomotives out of their production line. So I think that to the extent that Mr Callard and subsequently Mr Gama think that CSR was incapable of manufacturing heavy haul locomotive, they were not correct but I think that you may have to speak to Mr Gama himself and to Mr Jiyane. 
UNKNOWN:  Chairperson, if I can be helpful in this regard?    The Regulation 10(6) notice that was brought to our attention, which was signed by the Chairperson dated the 12 t h of November 2020, has specific areas which required Mr Molefe to prepare his affidavit on and this Regulation 10(6) notice makes no reference to McKenzie.    Okay, thanks Chairperson. 
WITNESS:  Yes, that is true that it was never investigated.  I am not aware that there was an investigation. 
 MR MOLEFE:  Of 100 locomotives. 
ADV MASUKU:  We are – we okay tomorrow Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
