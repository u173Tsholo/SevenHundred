CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.     Thank you very much.     Good morning Ms September.      Yes thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    How come you have Exhibit 2 to Exhibit Z2 to Exhibit Z5 without Exhibit Z1?    How come you have Exhibit Z2.     Up to Exhibit Z5 without Exhibit Z1?     Ja.    Okay.  We will just have to try and sort that out because otherwise I could or anybody could look for where is Z1, am I missing Z1.  Okay alright.    Actually why do we not fix that now?  If you have got – if the lever arch files are Exhibit ZA and ZB this should be ZC to Z whatever is it not?    That is more logical to me.    ZC.    And Z3 will be Z4.    Ja.    Well you see you people need to be consistent.  When  we were – we had Exhibit Y we had Exhibit Y, Exhibit YA and Exhibit YB so now if we change now to have Z1 and Z2 instead of ZA and ZB it is not logical.  So what is the change?  So if you have kept AB with theothers  it is better to keep it – to stick to that.    Unless there is any particular problem that I am not aware of that you want to tell me about?     Are you talking about referencing that has alreadyhappened in existing statements?     No when we – well if we change now to whatever whether we change to Exhibit Z1, Z2 and whatever the witness will be told and his will have been changed to that and he will g ive evidence using those exhibit numbers.    All I was simply saying is it is better to keep consistency.  I have no particular liking for ZA, ZB or Z1 or Z2 all I am simply saying I must not have a situ ation where I look at this and I think I am missing Exhibit Z1.    And then in fact I do not miss anything.  So shall we just make it – we were making them ZC which is – was Z2, is that right?   And Z3 becomes ZD.    And then Z4 becomes ZE.    And Z5 becomes ZF.  Okay the witness’ ones mus t also be marked like that so that we are all on the same page.  Registrar do you want to assist the witness?     Yes thank you.  Should the Registrar administer theoath?    Are you ready? ADVOCATE VERUSHKA    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.   Yes.    Yes.  Well I guess you should not say ring -fenced because if you say ring-fenced it is like it is being made secret.  Nobody must have access to it.  As I understand the position it is – the – the arrangement between the legal team of the commission and t he witness is concerned in the light of the discussion was it last week?  Isthat until I have received submissions with regard to what should happen relating to in regard to evidence about certain disciplinary hearings that Mxolisi Zondo chaired we will w ait until everyone who has that evidence as far as the legal team knows who is going to testify has it and if I am going to end up hearing it then I will hear it.  If somebody else will hear then that person will hear it.  So I just wanted to say it is not like ring-fenced as if nobody must see it.  It is just – it is evidence that is before the commission like any other evidence and it is not treated in any special way. Okay.    Yes.    Ja, ja, no it is just that it will be dealt with later because there is still the issue of who must hear it that must be dealt with first.    Ja.    Will not be dealt with at this stage.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Thank you.     Well the legal team may or may not have decided it – it may be important just as an announcement was made as to what the position of the – of Mr McBride was and Mr Sesoko was it may that each witness who has something to say about evidence that will be dealt with later is also announced but it could be that it could be announced later when the evidence is given.  So I leave that to the legal team and the witnesses concerned.     Okay.      Well before Ms September starts I heard her saying or rather Mr Pretorius say Major General Booysen and Ms September saidGeneral Booysen.  I must just confess that I get very confused with police and military titles so maybe let us start by you clarifying is it Major General, is it General?     Okay no that is alright I just thought I would confess my – my ignorance just on a lighter note talking about Major General Booysen and General Booysen when one of my sons was much younger and I was Judge President he asked me who is higher, is it JudgePresident or President?  So I told him that the President of the country is the highest office.  So with Major General I also would not know whether it is the General or Major but I understand it must be General I do not know.  But thank you very much.  I wanted to say thank you for coming forward to assist the commission.  We appreciate it.  You probably know that we have been calling for people who have b een heading departments or heading units and other people to come – please come forward and share with the commission and with the nation what they know in terms of things that have happened in the past in their departments and elsewhere that relate to sta te capture, that relates to serious corruption that falls within our terms of reference.  So I really appreciate it that you have come forward.  Thank you very much.    You may proceed.   Thank you.    Thank You.    Well before that I see in your statement that you also mentioned that you were also Deputy Provincial Commissioner in KZN at some stage?    Yes.   Hm.    Yes.  That position of being Deputy Provincial Commissioner was it linked to the Police Provincial Commissioner or was it in relation to the HAWKS?  I am just trying to see whether that puts you as either the second in comma nd of the police in the province or one of the Deputy Provincial Commissioners in the whole police service or whether it was simply Deputy Provincial Commissioner in relation to the HAWKS?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.   Yes thank you.    Is there a slide you want to show?     Okay let us see.    Oh we already have it I remember it ja.    Okay.    Ja.    Okay.    Well you asked him whether he highlighted certain entities or sections and on the  slide that you were showing then we could see come some that seemed to be highlighted or darkened and in the one that you are showing now we can see some that are darkened. Do you want him to just to confirm whether the ones he highlighted are the ones that have been shaded or something?     Okay thank you.    Under you?    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.    Let him just articulate it.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm, thank you.    Well in relation to the point you articulated earlier on you said you believe that the evi dence you will give will support the statement you have made about certain sections of the Law Enforcement Agencies being captured?    Thank you.    Can you arrange for me to get a hard copy of the same thing because I do not think I have got it here?     Oh, okay.  I missed that.  Thank you.     Okay, thank you.  Yes you may proceed.    Okay.  I am sorry.  Before you proceed just remind me again as at that date as at that year 2010 what your position?  Were you at that stage?    You were Head of the Hawks Provincial Office?     Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Ja, you may proceed.    Did you say he had also given a copy of the same report to the Provincial Commissioner?     The Provincial Commissioner?   And who would have been the Provinc ial Commissioner at that time?     Oh, okay alright, but the meetings that you are talking about in the mornings are the – are meetings that in her ca pacity she would attend as well?    Okay, alright.    Yes.    So you say you took the report that was meant for her?   Ja.    Ja.    And you took it?    Okay, yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Oh, okay.    Okay.    And the same people who have accessed to what you called – did you say?    How do you spell that?    Oh.    Oh, okay.  The same people with access to that system also have access to the registration of inquiries?     But they do not bother most of the time?     Ja.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Ja.    Okay.  No, thank you.    So you asked a?    Brigadier?    Lategan to investigate and report back to you on this issue?    Ja.    At SAPS, S-A-P-S?    Yes, okay.    Yes.   Hm.    Yes.    I am, I am sorry.  I just want to understand what went into the books of somebody in Umhlanga Rocks?     Yes.    Can approve [intervenes].    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes, but you were making an example about if somebody from national was visiting the provincial offices of SAPS and you were saying something about the Hilton Hotel.     Hm.    Which was outside of the processes - which was not in accordance with – which would not be in accordance with the normal processes?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Of your concern?    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.  Okay, thank you.  I just wanted clar ification.    Now when she said you must stop this investigation which one was it?  Did you understand her to be talking about?     Now she referred to it when you asked her which one because there are lots of investigations that are ongoing.  Sh e said the supply chain management one.    That is how she described it, ja.    At that stage was the investigation that you gave to Brigadier Lategan the only supply chain management one – investigation – that you were busy with or people under you were busy with?    Yes.    Yes supply chain.    Yes.    Yes.  So, so there can be no doubt which one the twoof you were talking about?     Okay.    Thank you.    You were, you were the Provincial Head of the Hawks at the time.  Is that right?    And you - at that time was it during the time where you were supposed to report both to the Provincial Commissioner as well as the National Head of the Hawks?     Yes.  So technically speaking could she tell you tostop an investigation by virtue of the fact that you reported to her or is that something that even with her ranking above you and the fact tha t you reported - she was one of two people to whom you reported – is the position that it was she could not under any circumstances instruct you to stop an investigation?     Yes.  Certainly in terms of what you had seen in the report that you were given by I think Brigadier  Kemp you saw enough to justify that an investigation be done at least preliminarily and then you would take it from there but she was saying stop that?     Yes and you say she did not give you a chance to respond to her instruction?   Immediately, ja.    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    And that meeting was she there the Provincial Commissioner?    Not at this one, okay.    So you asked him to bring back the file?     Yes, okay.  Did you ask him whether he knew  how the Provincial Commissioner might have got to know about theinvestigation, Brigadier Lategan, did you ask him whether he had any knowledge as to how the Provincial Commissioner got to know about the investigation?    Oh those were the people who were assisting Lategan?    Yes, in the investigation.    Somebody then ...    Okay.    Yes.     So your idea was to have the file brought back while you think about how to handle this situation?    Yes, because if the file didn’t come back Brigadier Lategan and those assisting him could be taking further steps and then the Provincial Commissioner could hear that the investigation has not been stopped and she could come back to you before you had made up your mind as to how to handle the situation?     Can handle that situation.     Yes, ja okay.    This was, I see you say this was on 8 May 2010, about how long after the first call, was it a we ek or a few days or two?    Yes.    Oh okay, no that’s fine.    That should be correct?    Okay thank you.    And you never got to know what it is that may have made her think that the investigation was still going on?    Thank you.    Who was that coming to you to ask?     Okay.    Yes.  So normally the monitoring of the investigation would have been done by you, but now there was Nkosi but you said he was in inverted commas, so I assume that you mean on record he was the one to monitor because on record you were not going to beofficially or formally, but you would still have something to do with the investigation is that right?     Yes okay.    It’s time for the short break, okay.  We will take the short break and resume at twenty five to twelve.  We adjourn     You may proceed Ms September.    Oh yes.    Yes you overlooked them.    Yes okay I think they must just place themselves on record.    Yes.  They did already meet with me .  Thank you.    Good morning. ADVOCATE KAVITHA    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes thank you.    Thank you.   Morning.    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.  Thank you very much.   Okay.    Yes you may proceed.    Around what time of the morning would it have been more or less?    Yes okay.    Yes.    I am sorry when you came into the meeting had the meeting started already?     Not yet?    It had not started but you found that all of those people you have mentioned were already there [indistinct]?     Yes.  Before the meeting started or when the meeting started was it announced what the meeting was about?     Yes.  And you – you did not know about this meetinguntil you were – you got a phone call from her – somebody in her office?    Yes.  So the first thing that happened was she started speaking and she effectively was speaking to Brigadier Kemp?     Yes okay.    Okay alright no that is fine.  Continue.     But let us – let us – if you are able to let us get more in terms of what she said at that meeting as far as you are able to remember – what were – you have said that she if I can put it in my words.  It seems that you are saying she really was attacking Kemp or she was upset with him but I would like to hear exactly what she was saying if you are able to remember?    But –     Oh it had …     Okay.  And the discussion had nothing to do with that investigation that you told us about?  What she was saying at the meeting to Kemp?    Did not concern the investigation that you told us about?  The supply chain management investigation.     It did?    Yes.    Okay.    Yes, yes.    And you say she was upset?     Okay.    So at this time you – you decided or you had already decided that if an occasion arose you would – you would indicate yourconcerns about – your concerns about these irregularities.     Yes.    Yes.    Same investigation?  Same investigation that you or your people, your team, people under you were busy with and now actually were under General Dramat as well?     Yes.    But at that stage she did not know about Dramat’s arrangement?   That – ja okay.    But did it make sense to you that on the one hand at the same meeting and before she had said and was saying the investigation must stop but then now she was saying the investigation must be done by somebody other than the people who had already started on the investigation?     Oh did you that strike you as – as a kind of normal time within which to start and finish an investigation like or there was nothing wrong with that time?    Okay thank you.    Okay maybe before we talk about what happened after.  Was – did the meeting end on the basis that Ntanjana was goingto do the investigation?     That is the basis on which it ended.     Okay thank you.    And this was about how long after the meeting - the other meeting?    Okay.    And it appears or it starts at page 5 of Exhibit ZE.  Okay thank you.    Ja I guess you are not going to require asking him to read the whole report?    You can just talk to important features or what he is able to make out of the report?     Which ones?    Yes.  Okay and which one?     Okay.  Those are shorter.   That is fine.    Ja that is fine they are short.     So having read the report at that time when you got it, it was clear to you that the persons who had compiled it were making some progress in their investigation and that they were getting to know that there indeed appeared to have been certain crimes that had been committed and they say at the end of their report they were confident that if they were given time to investigate more and their investigationwas unhindered they were confident that they could prove certain crimes including fraud and maybe corruption?     Thank you.    What page of EXHIBIT ZA?     72, okay.  Yes.   Yes, but before we get there having read the report that you – parts of which you read a few minutes ago did you do anything about, about the report or the request made by those who prepared the report to say we would like to have an unhindered investigation to take this forward?  Is there anything you are supposed to do about – is there anything you did arising from being aware of the report?    Ja.    Yes.    But what was it two weeks after the first call from the Provincial Commissioner when you were on the road or was it twoweeks after the meeting, the meeting that you talked about?     Okay.    Okay.    Okay.  So you have been given this report.  It can be said to have been part of pursuing the arrangement that was made with General Dramat to say the investigation should continue and what role  you would play and so on.  That was part of that?     Yes.    Ja.    Oh, okay.  Okay.  Ja, I remember that paragraph was in a wrong, wrong place.  Alright.  Ja, it was not in the right place.    Okay, continue.    Ja.    Hm.    Ja.    Yes.  Okay.   This is a very poor copy.  If it all possible maybe arrangements could be to get a better copy but if attempt s have been made and this is the best we – that can be obtained that is okay.     Hm.   Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.   Hm.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    So this might be the best that we can have?     Yes.    Yes, okay.  It may be that in the end one can read everything that is in it which is the most important thing.  Okay.  That is fine.    Ms September I do not know whether your voice hasbecome softer than earlier.    I do not know if the people at th e back hear but maybe you can try and raise it.    Hm.    Ja.    Well I am not sure if I follow.  We are presently  dealing with the report at page 7 – starting at page 73 of EXHIBIT ZA.  Now part of the report one of the paragraphs talk about a report thathad been apparently given to the Provincial Commissioner.  Is that what you are talking about?    Okay.  So what is the question?     Huh-uh.    The earlier report that we dealt with would have been given to you in May?    Ja and this was beginning of June, 4  June?    So were there monthly reports that were being given to you about the progress of the investigation?    Periods.    So it.    Ja, okay.  So what are the important feature s of this second report – this report that you want to highlight in terms of the reports were to you and obviously seen what progress was being made.  You were to decide whether there was anything you needed to do or you simply needed to allow the investig ation to continue?    Yes.  If you think it links to that - to this you can talk about it.    Yes.  So let us do that.  How do we do that?  Where do we go in order for you to testify about something that you w ant to testify or will you be guided?  Ms  September do you know what he is talking about?    Yes.    Paragraph?    Okay, alright.  Yes.    Yes.    So the report that you talk about in paragraph 23 of your affidavit is the report that we find in EXHIBIT ZE?     Yes, okay.  Go ahead.   Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Answer.    Hm.    And that was about two weeks after that meeting that you told us about?    Okay.    The two weeks that he had been given, Ntanjana?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Yes, okay.  Thank you.  You asked to deal withthis in response to – because I had asked you the question what you did after reading the second report from Soobramoney.  The report that is in EXHIBIT ZA starting I think at page 73.  So my question was whether arising from reading that report there was anything you did.     Not from your side, but the report was directed to you.  Is that correct?    Yes and, and it would have been given also to General Dramat or you do not know?     Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay, but why would you not have doneanything arising out of it in the light of what appears to be a repeated plea.  I think starting from the previous report to say we need to be afforded an unhindered investigation.  I would have thought that you would have wanted to go back to Soobramoney and I say hear that just like in the first report you gave me you are still concerned that you are not getting an unhindered investigation.  This is what I have to say about it.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    But you did take certain steps is that r ight?    Yes.   Ja.    Yes.  Well Ms September you may have to make a judgment call.  Certain things belong to certain events and the timing and so on.  So I leave it to you whether the things that he is talking about should be dealt with now or later, but it is logical that if you get a report and people report to you, you should talk about what you may have done as a res ult of that report.    But I am – you have your own plan of how you want to deal with this.  So I am just alerting you that some of the most naturalquestions that arise might need to be addressed e arlier than how the statement has been arranged.    Hm.    Okay.    I am sorry.  Paragraph 28, did you say paragraph 28?     24.  Okay.  Tell us what happened sometime in June.     Hm.    Hm.    Tasha?    Okay.   Hm.    Hm.    So the Provincial Commissioner asked that the two of you proceed to the boardroom?     And in the boardroom you met the three persons who you have mentioned.  So, so it was now in that boardroom yourself, the Provincial Commissioner, Advocate Mkhize, Ms Giyapersad and there was somebody else as well, Panday.     Toshan Panday, ja.  Okay, ja.  Proceed and what happened?    Up to, up to the time you entered the boardroom you still did not know what the meeting was about?     Why you were called?    Okay.    Alright.  Okay tell.   Tell us what happened when the meeting started.     But hang on.  You have been called by the ProvincialCommissioner and, and she takes you into the boardroom where there are the people who you have mention ed.  The meeting is supposed to open, to be opened and everybody gets told what the meeting is about and one would expect that the Provincial Chairperson would be the person – the Provincial Commissioner would be the person who would do that.  Did she do that?    This was not an ordinary meeting.    Hm, but did he say what the meeting was about or did he just start asking you questions?     Hm.    But had you been told why each one  was here and so on?  You had not been told?     And what their role was?     So there was an attorney.  There was an advocate.  There was a suspect.  There was a Provincial Commissioner and yourself.    Yes.    So the attorney was Panday’s attorney?    And was Mkhize his advocate?     Okay, alright.  Continue.    Ja, finish with the meeting, ja.   That was the end of the meeting?    So let us try and get the gist of what was said.  There were allegations that you people were investigating without a mandate.  Is that correct?    But what was the basis given for that allegation, wasthere a basis given why that allegation was being made?     The Chairperson?    Ja.    Yes, did the Provincial Commissioner say anything during that meeting?    She just sat there and listened.    And Advocate Mkisi did he say anything?    Yes.    Oh, okay.  So the one allegation that was made wasthat you people were investigating without a mandate, but I’m not sure if that makes sense to me, I mean that allegation, the police are there to investigate, who is supposed to give the police their mandate they are there to investigate.     Yes so the one allegation was that you people were investigating without a mandate, another one was that Soobramoney was demanding money for them in order for them to stop the investigation extortion.     Yes.     Yes and you say that you responded – you tried to respond in general without specifics?   Ja and then the meeting was over.       And the meeting ended on the basis that insofar as they were accusing Soobramoney of extortion, you said they must give you an affidavit and then you would be able to look into that.      Ja and after the meeting did you have a chance to say to the Provincial Commissioner what was this all about, what’s going on?  Yes okay thank you.       So the – so what you’re saying is there was anindependent forensic audit report from Price Waterhouse which reflected that Mr Panday had paid a certain amount of money for a birthday – for the birthday party of the Provincial Commissioner ’s husband and that the amount mentioned was about R30 000.00?    Yes so this report was confirm ing something you had heard?       Okay thank you.      Oh it’s something that happened during the same year when you started the investigation?      Okay.     I’m sorry just to connect this, if the birthday party happened sometime late in May 2010 it means it happened – it means that when you were called for the first time by the ProvincialCommissioner when you were on the road in your car and when the second call also came and when that meeting happened, in all probability arrangements for that party were happening because it’s the same month?     Okay thank you.    Isn’t that the one where he said the Provincial Commissioner was quiet throughout, is that not the one?      Yes what’s the question then?      She confirmed that the investigation should be stopped?     That it had stopped?    Oh okay so just before you get into the boardroom she says to you the investigation has stopped.      And your understanding would have been that the investigation that she was talking about that she was saying hasstopped, would be the investigation by Ntanjana because she had said Ntanjana was the one who was going to investigate.     Oh okay.     Oh but was she asking you whether it had stopped or was she telling you tha t the investigation had stopped?     Oh okay now I understand.  Okay but then – okay when you get into the meeting she doesn’t tell these people that the investigation has stopped instead the people are bombarding you with questions but you also didn’t say but the investigation has stopped, you didn’t say that either?       Yes but she also didn’t?      Yes okay thank you.     Well let him do the testifying let him testify about these events don’t – yes.   Now to the – you were called to the Provincial Commissioner ’s office again.    And this time who called you, did somebody phone you this time?     Oh okay alright you were in the same building you were on the 14 t h floor and she was on the 18 t h floor.       Hang on, hang on you just told us about a meeting that happened where you got call ed to her office and you went into her office she was alone and she said the two of you had to go to the boardroom which is adjacent to her office or from her office you go into the boardroom, you went into the boardroom with her and found certain people there.  Now are you saying that now there was another meeting where more or less the same thing was happening, you go into her office, then she says you must go into the boardroom, she asks you about the investigation whether it has stopped, you confirm it has stopped and then you go into the boardroom, is that what you are saying?   And in-between from the previous meeting there had been no interactions between the two of you?      Yes but did she try to make contact...(intervention).     I’m just wondering why when you had told her beforethat the investigation had stopped she would call you up and she asked you again, has the investigation stopped and you say yes and then – it’s like a repeat of the previous meeting.      The truth was it had not stopped.     Called the meeting.      Okay alright so I stopped you as you were saying you went to her office and then the two of you went into the boardroom but before going to the boardroom she asked you  whether the investigation had stopped and you said yes and then you entered the boardroom.     So at this meeting the Provincial Commissioner, onceagain, did not say anything?     And...(intervention).      Oh in the meantime?    Without your knowledge?    Yes but you did...(intervention).     Oh they told you ja.     Ja well – so was she not surprised that just before you entered the boardroom you had confirmed that the investigation had stopped but now in the meeting you’re saying actually the investigation had been upgraded to the opening of a docket it w as nolonger an enquiry.  I would have expected that if she had believed you when you said the investigation had stopped, if now at the meeting you say actually a docket has been opened she should have been surprised.     Yes so what impression did you get of what the purpose of this meeting was from what was discussed?     So – but at this meeting what allegations or what was said really by the Panday side if I can call it that by the attorney or the two Advocates were there or him...(intervention).      Yes and how did this meeting end or what was the basis on which it ended?     Yes and did you do as you had done in the previous meeting in the previous similar meeting that after the meeting you didn’t want to speak to the Provincial Commissioner, you left or did youhave some discussion with her about this meeting?      Okay that’s why she treated you differently?    Yes, yes, she wouldn’t shout at you like...(intervention).     Yes that’s quite strange yes.      That would be Mdladla, I can’t remember if he writes it without an h but if he writes it with an h then it would be Mdlhalha, but I don’t know what your recollection is how it’s written but it’s not Madlala, it must be Mdladla.    Oh yes, we need to take the lunch adjournment, it’s already five past one, and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn     Thank you.  Ms September you  may proceed.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay long after it had been written?     Okay which makes you think it might not have been prepared with you in mind?  It might have been prepared for somebody else and then that is why you got it much  later?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    Yes well when I asked you the question I was asking you precisely because of that because my understanding and it may have been a mistaken understanding because of how some of th e events are dealt with in the new affidavit.  My understanding was that it – because of the role that you were supposed to play at a formal or official level after your discussion with General Dramat in Pretoria that it may be the report was meant for Gen eral Dramat and you were just being given it at a – on an unofficial basis.  That is what I was thinking and you are not sure?    Okay thank you.    So just to summarise to see where we are.  You got a report from Brigadier Kemp which he intended to give to you and to the provincial commissioner but you took the one that was meant for the provincial commissioner before she arrived and you subsequently instructed is it Brigadier Lategan to investigate after you had had a look at this report that you got from Brigadier Kemp.  And Soobramoney and Kemp were to assist Lategan, is that correct or o nly Soobramoney?    Oh okay.  Okay so Lategan was not the – the lead investigator?    Oh but he remained part of the investigation team or not really?    Oh okay.    Yes okay, okay, okay.    Okay that is what you did and then they began toinvestigate and at a certain stage while you were driving you got a call from the Provincial Commissioner who was quite upset and did not give you much time to respond to what she was saying but effect ively she wanted you to stop the investigation relating to the investigation that you had asked Lategan and the people under him to investigate.  And then subsequently you got or you told Lategan that the investigation should stop because that is what you had been told but in your own mind you wanted more time to think about how to handle the situation.  And then – and thereafter the file was returned to you by Lategan and a week or two after that you got another call from the ProvincialCommissioner, is that right?    And that is when you were or on that occasion she asked whether the investigation was still going on or that is what she talked about.    And you told her the investigation had been stopped and then after that you – a week or two later you got a call you were asked to come to her office to the Provincial Commissioner’s office, is that right?  And that is wh ere you found that she took you to the boardroom and there were some people there.     Yes.    I have missed out yes.    Yes.    Oh that is the one I want to talk – I am talking about.  Is it before where I am?     Yes that was the first meeting.  But it was after thesecond call from the Provincial Commissioner?     Yes, yes, yes.  And then – oh that was the first meeting?  And then later on there was another meeting.  You were called to her office and from her office you went into her board – the boardroom with her.  Before you got into the boardroom she asked whether the investigation had stopped.  You assured her it had stopped.  That is when you met Panday, his attorney and Advocate Mkeza and you told us what happened on that occasion.  After the meeting you went away.  Sometime later you were called and there was a similar meeting.  You were called to her office, she took you to the boardroom.  There was a similar meeting but the participants now were Panday, his attorney and two advocates who had not attended the  previous meeting and Advocate Mkeza who had attended the previous meeting was nolonger there.  So the advocates now were Advocate Chaudhary and Advocate Sticks Mdlala.  And you have told us what happened and the argument that you had with Mr Panday’s attorney.  That is how far you told us so far?    Thank you.    And did anything come out of that or you cannot remember?    Yes.    Yes.    The changes to the Law Society?     Okay and nothing happened after that?     H’m okay.    So – so the effect of what – of what General Cele was saying to you was that one the investigation should continue?     And the investigation he was t alking about was the one that the Provincial Commissioner had said should stop?     So you stopped?    And he was saying that the investigators should report to you?    And not to the National office. Not to General Dramat?    Is that – that was what he was saying?     Is your understanding that what he was saying in terms of the investigators reporting to you and not to General Dramat was your understanding that he was insisting that the reporting lines be the way they are supposed to be?     Okay.  Thank you.   I am sorry and I know Ms September that you said some parts of the statement are not where they are supposed to be.  I do not know whether what you are asking him about is a way from what he may have done subsequent to receiving these instructions from Commissioner – from General Cele whether what General Cele saidshould happen was  effected – implemented?    So I am saying I do not know whether you are moving away from that because I would like to know that whether as a result of maybe let me ask him.  As a result of or subsequent  to the instruction from General Cele was he – were his instructions then implemented in terms of 1. The continuation of the investigation.  2. The reporting lines. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Had never stopped ja.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Okay alright. Thank you.    After the instruction you got from General Cele saying the – about reporting lines and the continuation of the investigation did you speak to the Provincial Com missioner to say I have actually received an instruction from the National Commissioner of the Police to say the investigation must continue or did you talk to her about it now at all?    You did not.   Okay.  Okay.    Yes.    So you had obtained search and seizure warrants, is that right?    In respect of the people and the premises that you have talked about?    Okay thank you.   That is the provincial legislature?    Yes.    As you – the plan was that as you were entering the building of the provincial legislature?     That is when you would so to speak get the wind ofthe offices being searched that was the plan?     Okay.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    An instruction?    Yes.   Yes.    One of the suspects?     Yes.      The reports?    Yes.    Ntanjana and the Provincial Commissioner.     Yes.    Ja as if this was nothing serious.     Okay thank you.   I am sorry.  By the way is that the first report the one that you got from Soobramoney?     Yes okay.  That is – that is the report a copy of which was found at one of the suspect’s premises, residence?     Thank you.    What is the question?     Well he might not need to read but just to say if he knows but if he does not know he can read it to simply say some of th e new facts that were – that I referred to are the following 1, 2, 3,4 but if he does not know then he can – he can read.    Ja that was my understanding from what you said as well.    Yes.    Yes you were aware of it.    Okay alright.   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Did you mention that figure there?  I think it is 1  894 or is it 18 million?   Number 5.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.   Ja, okay. You may continue.    Were you concerned about whether we got the – whether he got the number correct?     Okay.  Well it is written – the first one or the second one on seven?    Ja.    It is R1 795 million.    Ja.    Okay.  That is how – that is how it looks.  Why is there a problem with this?    What is your leader saying?     Oh.    By the witness?    Oh, okay well I think he does say now that whatever he may have said the amount is R1  795 million.  Is that correct sir?    Ja, okay.    Thank you.    I, I know that you did say that you would be jumpingaround in the statement.    But it is a little frustrating because one is not able to follow exactly what the story is.  I do not know whether it is because I do not have something that says these are the events that  we are going to be following because if there is a statement you just look – one looks there.  I am not sure whether you would be able to help me or not but the jumping around seems to be making it difficult to follow the story.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja, okay.  Well.    Okay.  Maybe you might just – I do not know if it would help just to say these are the events that we will follow then from this event we go to this and we go to that.  That might help if I, if I know, but you might not have that ready.  So that might make it difficult.  Do the best that you can?     Huh-uh.   Hm.    This?    Ja.    Would it be more convenient if we gave these blocks numbers?  Then you can say.    You go to block to number so and so then we all know.    Somebody will need – I think you need to explain what you are doing to the witness but I gue ss we will mark one with the first one that says timeline Panday investigation.     And then we go on that line to the left.  Major General Booysen maybe you – I am sure you will be able to.    To follow because we might use.   Number so and so later on.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and it is quite comprehensive.     Crop up.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    The way it should be.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    No, I think probably this will help.  It is just that I did not understand then tha t it would – it would form the guide of what we start with.  So- but I am just marking them - the blocks one, two, three so that you can say we are now at block whatever.  Then I know whichone it is.    Yes.    So it would be one, two – one up to six and then the second line starts from seven to 12.     And then they continue.   Yes.    I have ended up on block 30.    Is that correct?  Okay, alright.    Thank you.    Okay.  Now we can proceed at least.  I will – I should be able to – yes.    Okay.   Is that because we have covered all the other blocks before that?    Okay, alright.  Thank you.    2010?    Yes.  As the conversation between you and Mr Edward Zuma was taking place your friend was there present?     Okay, thank you.    Who was it from?    You got a call from somebody.  Who was that?     Yes.    Yes, okay.    Yes.    So it appears that the call was just about him wanting to greet you?    [Intervenes], ja.    Yes, but ultimately the discussion was nothing more?     About – nothing more than just greeting?    Okay.    So maybe before we proceed.  Just to go back to the R50 million.  Before Mr  Edward Zuma’s visit to your office there was – you said there was an amount of about R50 million which you had discovered was about to be paid out by SAPS?     Had to be paid out to Mr  Panday’s company?    Yes and you had given instructions that that should not happen?    Yes.   Yes.    Oh, okay.  Thank you.    And who was that, Khulubuse?     Okay.   Yes.    That was the nephew?    That is your understanding, yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Did your friend who accompanied you know what the purpose of the visit was?  Let us talk about the first visit.     Yes and - and you had asked him to facilitate the meeting?    And when you left for Nkandla your understanding was that the meeting had been facilita ted and that the former President was expecting you or would be expecting you to arrive?    Yes, but when you arrived at his residence – in Nkandla – you said you never entered the room  or you did enter?    The first time you did enter?     You remained in the yard or?     In the yard and your friend entered a certain room?    And he emerged later on?     And made a certain report to you about what his discussion inside the room was?  How it went?     Yes, but you left without meeting the former President yourself?    Yes and the report that you got from your friend was that the former President did not want to get involved?     Yes and then sometime later you – there was another – you made another trip to Nkandla another visit?    And that one had been facilitated by your friend again as well?    Same, yes.  On that occasion you did enter the room.     And at some stage in the room were yourself, your friend and the former President but for a set period of time the former President and your friend move into another adjacent room?    And you were left in the other room?     And then they came back later on and you talked about other things but not about the purpose of your meeting?     Ja and later on your friend told you that the former President did not want to be involved and said maybe you people could speak to Khulubuse?    That is the report you got?     And then you went to see Khulubuse?     And Khulubuse’s attitude towards that he would talk to Mr Edward Zuma but from what you said it is like he was disapproving of something about Khulubuse.  Is that right?  I thought you said something like nonsense.  I thought you said something that he must stop his nonsense or whatever?     Yes.  Was that coming from Khulubuse?     Ja.    Oh, okay.    Okay, but now you had gone to – you had wanted to see the former President because you believed that he should know about this – the involvement of Mr Edward Zuma?    I assume with Mr Panday?    That is what you wanted to?     To alert him to.    So you ended up alerting Khulubuse and he said he would talk to Edward Zuma?    Was your understanding that he was going to talk to him with – with the idea that he must stop something or stop being involved with somebody or what was your understanding of what the purpose was going to be of talking to him?     Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    I’m sorry before you get an answer to that, I think you have got the spelling for Khulubuse Zuma incorrectly there, there is no “a” instead of the “a” there, there should be “u” and the “h” before the “e” at the end should not be there.     Yes.   It’s quite leading when you ask him that in that way but it’s okay, what did Panday do in regard to these investigations?       But when the person you referred to, did you say Moses?     Oh Mostert.   That was a colonel in the SAPS?     A warrant officer in Gauteng?     Oh okay so he got a call from Mr Panday at a tim e when he was with you?      No he was not with you when he got the call?      Oh so he just reported to you about this call?    And when he reported to you, he had already met withMr Panday...(intervention).        Oh okay so you say that after he told you what – after his discussion with Mr Panday had gone, you said he should actually have handled it differently so that you could possibly do a Section 205 subpoena?     Yes okay and what does that involve?      Yes so this is to make sure that if it is legitimate there is proof.     That which otherwise is criminal?      Yes, yes okay because if you don’t have it then you can’t say it was legitimate.   Ja okay so – but – so that was arranged and in order for this to work Mr Panday and Mostert were supposed to meet and Mr Panday was supposed to get into the car that would have be en wired, I think you said, and then the conversation that they would have had, would have been recorded but that recording didn’t take place because Mr Panday didn’t want to get into the car?      Ja and you say that they did engage in a conversation outside of the car but Mr Panday – Mr Panday was speaking on the basis that he had no recollection of the previous discussion.     Ja okay, alright.    And was this a few days after the first encounter that the two of them had, had when Mr Panday had made this request to Mostert?     So there’s no way that Mr Panday would have genuinely forgotten about that conversation?     Okay.      And if that is so clearly he had either got wind of something or he had looked at the whole thing and thought that there was something that Mostert was up to.     Okay thanks.    And just remind me again, I think I may have missed the name, who is the person that was coming t o you together with Madhoe?     Oh okay.     In private.    Did you say that the pictures that he was showing were pictures of dead people?        Oh okay so he opened this laptop before he could say anything after the other person had left the two of you?      Okay.     Was he opening the laptop in such a way that you should see the pictures or you just happened to see the pictures, they were not meant for you to see?     Oh he was showing you the pictures.      Okay.     So he was saying that you are in a possession of a certain police investigation report?    Ja okay.     The first or the second?      Yes.   That’s now him and who, Mr Panday?     You say that is when they had an application to set aside the 205’s?    Ja so I’m asking who they is?      But he was one of them?     And Mr Panday was one of the people who were behind the application or you don’t know?      Okay.     But was he not asking you to put a date on the report that would have been prior to the 205’s.      But how would that invalidate the 205’s?    Oh okay.    Oh okay okay okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay thank you.    But what was the point about these pictures of dead people that he was showing you?  Was he trying to intimidate you or threaten you, what was the point?     Okay so in the end the request he was making to you was that you assist him and whoever by putting a date on the report that on the second – on the first report that you got from Soobramoney put a date that would have been prior to the Section 205’s and if you had agreed to do that that could have led to the invalidation of the 5’s?    Yes okay.  But you parted on the basis that you said you would speak to somebody – to the investigators?    Yes okay.    Yes when you talk about invalidation all you mean is because there was a court application pending.     It would have helped the case of those who wanted the court to set aside these 205 applications that is the point you are making?    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    252 being the operation that you and Moste rt tried with Panday and it did not work?     Ja a similar kind of operation.     Yes.    That is in Pretoria now?     Ja.    Just before you proceed.  Was it strange that somebody at his level would call you to come to him downstairs or was there some previous discussion?     Yes.    That is what I thought was strange.     But you went anyway?     Okay.    Because I assume you were still going to contact him in order for you to make arrangements where you would meet so that you could execute your 2052A?     Ja.    Yes.    When you came back.  Yes so – but when he called you and asked you to come downstairs you were ready t o use your operation already or not really?     But you went there.    Okay.  Okay.   Yes.    So he gave you a brown envelope and said that report that he was talking about is inside the envelope?     Okay.    Who was saying that now?     Ja okay.    Ja.    Yes.  So you had – you had opened the envelope that Colonel Madhoe had given you?  At some stage y ou opened it?    You did not open it?     You gave it to…     Yes as it was?    Oh okay but somebody did open it at some stage?     Yes okay.  Okay.  So they actually found the report that he was talking about inside or what?     The same report ja okay.    Thank you.    Did you send Madhoe the figure that yo u had promised to send?    Oh you did not respond immediately to the – to themessage from Madhoe?    Yes.    Okay.    Okay thank you.    Okay I am sorry I know that you said that the interaction between the two of you is captured and is in some docket.  Do we have that anywhere here or it is somewhere else and we will get it some other stage?    Is current?    Ja.    Yes.  Okay well we – we need to find a way of leaving out what we get and what we might not get out of that.  We just need to find a way of connecting the story.  You had received a message from Colonel Madhoe and at some stage I assume you reverted to him and then something happened.  Are you able to say, I did revert to him and subsequent to that we have had another engagement or something like that?  I just want to see even if we are not going into the contents.     Of the messages.    Yes.    In the building?    Yes.  You get the message.    The engagement is in a meeting form or just talking on the phone?    Sorry?    Oh okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Of dead people?    Oh and I guess this time do you ask him what is the point about this or you still do not  ask him?    Yes,  ja.    Did you pretend you were scared?     Did you pretend you were scared by this?     Okay.    Two bar?    Ja what was your understanding of what that …     Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Chair it continued I had a number of meetings w ith him and the day before we did the actual sting operation one of my detectives was shot and killed and I attended the funeral.  He alsocame to the funeral.    Around those days?    And we are around mid-2010 or where are we now?     August 2010 ja.    Just to go back if I may.  The message that you hadreceived from Colonel Madhoe when you were with General Dramat where there was a two is that the one that made you think he was talking about R20 000,00.    At that time.    Oh okay, okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Oh 2011 ja okay.    To backdate the report?     H’m.    The backdated report?     At that stage you had no t backdated – you had not backdated it    Ja.    You are now having this conv ersation at the basement of…    You are still in the car?     Okay.    This now the arrangement b etween the two of you that is yourself and Colonel Madhoe was that you were going to go to the casino the following day?     Okay.    And you cannot at this stage remember the date or you have got the date somewhere?     8 September 2010?    2011 ja okay.    Ja redeploy the people.    He said/    Ja, okay.    Then the indication.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    [Intervenes].   Hm.    Hm.  Yes.    Of course even if he had gone away with the document and when – and he was not arrested there and then on thespot with you having taken photos with – you had a camera with you.  You would have been able to show the circumstances under which you had backdated that document and his - his picture would have been on the camera when he showed you the money in the basement and all of that.    Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.  No, no I understand, ja.  I am just saying it does not look like it would have been the whole operation would have been defeated but obviously you were better off having him arrested there and then?    Ja, okay.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    This is now on the same day?     Oh, before he came to the building, before Madhoe?    So - so he got this call on his way to the building?     To meet you?  Ja, okay and you hear this conversation subsequently?    Yes, okay.    Hm.    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.  Thank you.   Yes.    Hm.  I guess that we should at least go up to half past.  Would that be fine with you?     Yes.  Let us go up to half past I think.     Yes.    Hm.    No, let us use the – let us the 15 minutes.  We will stop whatever and then we will proceed tomorrow.     Of the second?    The second report?    Ja, okay.  Thank you.    Registrar.    Thank you.  I just want to – oh that is much better.  So I will just replace this one with the new one.  Thank you.  You may proceed.    I am sorry.  You say September.  I see that in paragraph 40 he has got 8 August 2011.    Oh, okay.  So it is September?     Okay, thank you.    Okay.    Okay.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Hm.    It is like he is getting worried now?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    Hm.    82?    It is page 82 of EXHIBIT     ZA?    Rather than 82 of his affidavit.    Yes.  His affidavit goes up to 70 something.   Okay,thank you.  82.    But the document actually starts at 83.  Is that right?     Or not really, at 82 ja.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Hang on one second.  Are you asking him to read t he whole transcript?    I do not think that is really – he should read the whole transcript.  He had listened to the conversation and he has readthis.  He should just tell us what the main features of the co nversation is and one can read this later.    Okay.  Let me ask him.  You listened to the conversation.  Did you not?     And you have read this transcript, have you?  This transcript have you had a chance to read it?     Yes.  What are the main features of the conversationbetween the two people?     Hm.    Okay.  Okay, alright.    No that is fine then, okay.    Ja, okay.  Read it then.  It is, is it four pages?  Okay, read.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Ja.    Hm.    Important part okay.    So some of the close corporations which were the subject of the investigation were – or two of them – were close corporations in which both Mr Panday and Mr Mzobe were involved.    Okay.    The Provincial Commissioner?     Yes.  Is there something you can point out in the conversation that.   That you say suggest that it was the [intervenes]?     Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes, okay.  Thank you.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Which you understood to mean what?  What did you understand them to be meaning when they say you needed to be clipped?    Huh-uh.  So at that juncture you were not sure.  Is that correct?    But subsequently you attached a meaning to it?    And what is the meaning that you attached to it subsequently?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  So you could link that to this clipping of wingsthat the – that was referred to in the conversation?     Okay, thank you.    And this was still 2011, second of half of 2011?     Okay.  Thank you.    By the time he was arrested – that is Mr Panday – Colonel Madhoe was out on bail or not yet or you cannot remember?     Okay.  Thank you.    Hm.    Okay.  Okay.  We are – we have just gone past half past four.  I think we may – we can – we should adjourn now and then tomorrow Mr Pretorius shall we start at 10 tomorrow as well?     Yes and we talked about half past nine.     Yes.    Yes.  I think maybe let us s tart at 10.    Ja.  Okay.  We will adjourn at this stage then and wewill start at 10 o’ clock tomorrow morning. We adjourn.

The first is Exhibit Z2 which contain s the first supplementary affidavit of this witness.     The next is Exhibit Z3 whichcontains a timeline and diagrams to orientate this witness’ evidence.     Exhibit Z4 contains his second supplementary affidavit and Exhibit Z5 contains a third supplementary affidavit plus additional documents.     Excuse me.    Yes.    Chair I have been – I have been informed that ZA and B     As it pleases Chair.  Chair there is one preliminary issue.    I am guided by – by you.   Okay.  If that is so then Exhibit Z2 as you direct would become?     Chair as a…    Would it be possible at all to propose that the Exhibit ZA and Exhibit ZB referred to Exhibit Z1 please?    Okay I am led by your direction Chair.    The only challenge while I am guided by Chair ’s direction – the only challenge that may encounter is through referencing to the documents based on the evidence as it is to be presented.    No problem.    No problem Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Thank you.      I just wish to highlight a point and that is in particular relation to the Exhibit ZF     Which is the last one.    Chair this particular exhibit has been prepared to ring-fence a preliminary issue and the evidence in relation to the preliminary issue.     Concerning additional evidence that Mr Booysen intends to present to this commission regarding Advocate Mxolisi Zondo.    Who is your younger brother.    And it is certainly not secret.   And in line with the approach of the DCJ particularly in relation to McBride’s evidence we w ill then accept that this – that particular evidence which is contained all in Annexures Exhibit ZF.    Will not be dealt with…     During these proceedings.    And it will be considered and determined once the conflict issue in relation to McBride’s evidence has been determined.    Of a similar nature.    Thank you Chair.    If I may then request that this particular witness be sworn in please?    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  May I address you as General?     Thank you.  If I could ask you to look at bundle ZA which is the one of the lever arch files befo re you?  And if I can ask you to turn to page 1 of that bundle?  Do you recognise this document?    If I can then ask you to turn to page 70 of the same bundle?  Do you recognise t he signature on thatpage?    And is it correct that you deposed to this affidavit on the 2 April 2019 before a Commissioner of Oaths?    Thank you.  If I can now ask you to turn to and please bear with me on the change of Exhibit numbers but it would be ZC.  In doing so can I ask you to turn to page 1 of this affidavit?  Do y ou recognise this document?     Please identify it?    And that was on the 9 April 19, is that correct?    Okay.  This particular affidavit corrects certain typographical errors in your main affidavit.  If I can askyou to turn to page 2 of it and in particular paragraph 5.1.  Is it correct that at paragraph 30 of your main affidavit the date was incorrectly stated as May 2011 and ought to have been reflected May 2010?     Thank you.  If I can now ask you to turn to Exhibit ZE please.  Likewise please turn to page 1 and kindly identify the document?     Thank you.  And that – sorry and this particular affidavit was signed on the 15 April 2019, that is correct?    If I can ask you to turn to page 2 of the same affidavit and paragraph 6 in particular.  There are further typographical corrections that have been made.  Is it correct that you retired in the year of 2017 and not 2016 as re corded in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your main affidavit?    Thank you.  As you would have heard for purposes of your evidence today you need not refer at all to Exhibit ZF.  Turning to page 1 of your main affidavit in File ZA is it correct firstly that your affidavit which is your main affidavit your first and your second supplementary affidavits are all true and correct?     Thank you.  In that instance can I ask you to please in your own words inform the Chair about your career in the service?    Please you are welcome to.    If I can just ask you to pause there.  Please indicate the Chair which Commissions of Inquiry to gave evidence at?    During your term serving the South African Police Services can you just at a higher level indicate theranks that you have held and the capacities in particular that you have held during your service?     Chair at this particular point it may be helpful to ask that slide 1 be placed on screen?     Yes Chair.    This particular slide is in fact found in your – in bundle…    ZD.    ZD in fact contains all of the a timeline and diagrams that will be referred to at different intervals.     During Mr Booysen’s evidence.    General – General Booysen if I may?  The slide that you see before you, is it correct that this slide was given to you by the commission to consider?    Yes there is certainly another slide.    To be shown now which is…    Your one in particular.    Okay thank you.  The slide is really just to orientate the evidence that you are about to give.  If I can then ask for Slide 2?  Is it correct that after considering Sli de 1 you had highlighted certain entities within the structure that your evidence addresses?   Just to orientate this particular diagram when we look at the police cl uster if I may?  Thank you.  Can you for the record inform the different entities or positions that your evidence to be dealt with at this hearing will address?     Do you confirm that…     Thank you.  In particular there is a slight variation to this particular diagram as compared to the one that you were provided with which is at Slide 1?     Can you please identify the difference in structure and why you highlighted a difference?     Placed themselves on record.    I humbly apologise.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you for the indulgence Chair.    General Booysen before the short adjournment you gave evidence in relation to the phone call that you had with the police commissioner on the 8 May.  We are now on page 6 of your affidavit where you describe in paragraph 19 a meeting that you had during mid-June 2010.  Please describe the events of thismeeting to the Chair in your own words?     What then happened at this meeting?    Following that meeting were you provided with any form of an investigative repo rt from one of the investigators in the Toshan Panday investigation?     While you do refer to this particular report much later in your evidence I think it is prudent to consider the report at this stage.  So in this regard I ask you to turn to Exhibit ZE which is a soft blue folder.  And in particular I ask you toturn to page 2 of that affidavit.  In paragraph 5 on page 2 of this affidavit you mentioned that the progress report which was attached to your main affidavit was not in fact the actual report that you had intended to attach and so with this affidavit you attach the actu al report which is the report that you now speak of in your evidence as the Report of Colonel Vassan Soobramoney.  Is that correct?     Can I then ask you to turn to page 5 of the same bundle, soft bundle and because of the importance of this report to the entire investigation and the evidence that is yet to be presented I ask you to read through certain paragraphs into the record.  Can I ask you to read through the sec ond, third and fourth paragraphs please?  And before you do so for the record this particular report is titled Preliminary Report of Investigations Commercial CrimeInquiry 07/05/2010.    Thank you Chair.    Yes.    Thank you.  Paragraph 5 at the bottom of this page refers to a particular bed and breakfast, can you please identify the name and location of this bed and breakfast ?  It is in the actual heading.    And then what follows on the next page if you could start reading from the second lin e which begins with the first claim to give particularity to the natures of the claims thatwere lodged?    To give credence to that summary you have mentioned I ask then that you deal with readin gparagraph 6 and 7 please.    Of the same report.    No Chair.    If – as it pleases Chair.  There is just two more paragraphs if I may?     And paragraph 16.    Paragraph 16 and 17.    And 17 and the first sentence on paragraph 17.    Paragraph 16, 16 on the same page.    And then the first sentence on paragraph 17.    And in conclusion on page 9 the requirements of the investigators is noted in the last paragraph.  Can I ask you to just read that last paragraph please?     Correct.    Thank you.  Is it thus correct to just summarise what you have r ead.  That Mr Toshan Panday was the director of the claimant for all of these claims for Gold Coast Trading CC?    Is it also correct that there were essentially the following people who were involved in these particular transactions such being Mr Toshan Panday?     Colonel N Madhoe?    And Captain A Narainpersad if I…    If I have pronounced that correctly.  Is it then also evident from this report that the issues relating to the claim concerned false claims submitted to the SouthAfrican Police Services?     Is it also correct that there was an inflation of costs for the claims that were submitted to the South African Police Services for payment?     Thank you Chair.  GeneralBooysen you mentioned that there is a certain correction that you need to make in relation to evidence that you had given earlier on the Soobramoney Report.      I did say earlier on it was directed at me but I am not a hundred percent sure whether it was forme or for Dramat.    Okay.  If I can take you to pageparagraph 32 please.     You missed out.   And that is the – that is the one meeting that she had with Kemp, Madhoe, Ntanjana.     Thank you Chair.  Following the last meeting that the Chair has just eluded to where you had an exchange of words with Tasha Giyapersad did you take any further steps subsequent to that specific to Tasha Giyapersad?    If I can then take you to page , paragraph 32 of your main affida vit.  Mention is made in youraffidavit of an engagement that you had with national police commissioner General Bheke Cele, can you please inform this commission about that engagement?     Turning over to page 11 paragraph 33.  Did Mr Toshan Panday challenge the Section 205 subpoena’s that were sought against him?     I leave it.    In that instance during the continuing investigation did Toshan Panday challenge the Section 205 subpoena’s at all?    If I could then take you to page 12 paragraph 41.  Did the investigation result in any search warrants being obtained and if so against wh om?    Can I just interrupt you and askyou to clarify which premises were then being targeted for search and seizure?    In that regard can I quickly take you to soft file Exhibit ZE.  And in particular JB1.1 which is – starts at page 5.  Is this in fact the report that you were now referring to in your evidence?    Can I ask you …     Some important facts that were investigated obtained through investigation is referred at paragraph 3 to paragraph 7 of that report.  At page 10 of that same bundle.  Some important facts that were investigated obtained through  investigation is referred at paragraph 3 to paragraph 7 of that report.  At page 10 of that same bundle.    There were certain facts that were discovered through the investigation which went t o the gravity of the investigation itself.  Can I ask you to please from paragraph 2 to 7 to read that into the record?    This – this appears to be the first report.   This is the first report.    Please proceed.    Can you please then place this detail on record by reading in paragraphs 2 to 7?     If I can just ensure I too understand the evidence that you have given.  Is it correct then that it was Mr Toshan Panday’s bank details which founded or rather was important to the investigation at hand?     Thank you.  Is it then correct that a Section 205 was necessary in order to obtain such bank details?     Is it then also correct tha t the request that was being made to you by Colonel Madhoe to predate the report would have had the effect to invalidate those Section 205 subpoenas?    And would it then be correct to say that the invalidation of the Section 205 subpoenas would have compromised the entire investigation?     Thank you Chair.  What then transpired once you had this meeting with Colonel Madhoe?     Your discussion with Colonel Madhoe entailed you providing a number can you please give more detail in relation to what transpired thereafter?     Please proceed.    You are on page 12 paragraph 39.  Alternatively we could look to…    I say it is block 23 or that particular paragraph but please continue.     If I could…    If I could take you to paragraph 40. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Effectively constitutes asExhibit Z1.    Chair if I am – if I may?    No Chair it is through the presentation of evidence.    Before…    In that – thank you Chair.  I therefore apologise for the use of word ring-fenced because it was actually intended to mean that the evidence in relation to the conflict issue is to be dealt with separately.     To set clarity for all other matters.    If you turn to page 4 of that same bundle.    Thank you.  You mentioned that you retired from the South Africa Police Services during Sep – during February of 2017.  How does that date compare to the date of your retirement?    Thank you Chair.  Before we proceed with the continuing evidence of this witness I need to humbly apologise to my colleagues in the audience who have not    So following that meeting …     So if I could ask you to readout the unnumbered paragraph 2, 3 and 4 which has the sub -paragraphs in them.    Paragraph 13 which is on page 8.    If I may then – if we could go back to where you ended off just before the long adjournment.  Youwere speaking about a Section 205 subpoena that was sought in relation to information that was required to be obtained.  Can you please in very simple terms explain to the public at large exactly what is a Section 205 subpoena?     Thank you very much.  And  that is in fact the procedure that was followed in order to access Mr Toshan Panday’s bank accounts in relation to the investigation against him?     Now for the evidence going forward I am going to ask you to just bear with me I am going to hop around a bit in the affidavit itself with no disturbance to the sequence of events or the timeline.    Can you please explain then the circumstances of how those search and seizure warrants were executed?    Are you aware of these facts Sir?    Block 23. 
SEPTEMBER :Before the oath is administered. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience?    Do you swear that the evidence that you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.     Thank you.    All rise. 
BOOYSEN : Johan Wessel Booysen.  Chair the investigation bar the week or so that the fi le was lying on my table and in cognisant of the fact that the investigators were still continuing the investigation never really stopped.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   No.    Yes.    So help me God.    Thank you Chair I am not rank conscious but you can  either address me as just General or Mr Booysen or Johan if you want to thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair.    You may thank you.    I do Chair.    I do Chair that is my signature.    I do Chair.    Chair it is a supplementary affidavit that I deposed to.    And the signature that appears there Chair is my signature and it was made under oath at the Garsfontein Police Station.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is also correct Chair.    Chair that is a second supplementary affidavit that I deposed to and which I signed on the 15 April at Midrand and it was commissioned in the presence of aCommissioner of Oaths.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is indeed so Chair.    Chair I joined in 1976 as a constable where I was a patrol person, a patrolman and I retired as I said February 2016.  During my career I acquired certain academic qualifications I do not know if it is necessary to go into that?    Chair the first one I keep on forgetting the name but it relates the killing of eighteen ANC members at Shobashobane in 1995.  There was a subsequent Commission of Inquiry in which I testified.  I later testified at the Alexander Commission of Inquiry into taxi violence.  And more recently I testified at the Mogoro Commission of Inquiry.     Chair…    That is correct Chair.    Chair if I may just clarify that?    When the – with the advent of the establishment of the DPCI known as the HAWKS     The Provincial Heads were appointed as Provincial Heads and also they also became Deputy Provincial Commissioners.  Subsequent to that there was the Glenister issue in – that went up to the constitutional court that had changedsubsequently but during my time I was also the Deputy Provincia l Commissioner for KZN.    Chair I elude to that later on in my affidavit but if I can explain it now?     What happened is…     We were all appointedas Deputy Provincial Commissioners and I think that was t o circumvent the problem where there were other Deputy Provincial Commissioners as well that – so it obviated us reporting to them.     So at that point in time we – I had two people that I reported to.     I reported to the Provincial Commissioner and to the National Head of the HAWKS>     But much later there was the Glenister challenge in the high c ourt that eventually ended up the constitutional court where the constitutional court held that I should report directly to the National Head of the HAWKS who in turn would not report to the National Commissioner at the time but to the Minister of Police.    I am not too sure if it is the same one that I altered.    Okay.    Okay I –     I concede this was given to me by the – by the commission.    That is indeed so Chair.    Those are my highlights Chair.    That is so Chair.     Chair I don’t have an independent recollection of whether I asked him that or not, but what I do know is, which emerged later on was that Van Loggerenberg and Soobramoney started to make enquiries in Supply Chain Management.     Chair I arrived at my office that morning just about after seven and then I received a call from the secretary of the Provincial Commissioner to come up to her office.  To me it was strange in a sense that she was never at the office that early.  She would invariably arrive late at work.     Chair that was about quarter past seven.    But invariably for – even for the management meetings which started – it was supposed to have started half past seven which she changed to eight o’clock but she invariably would come late for even those meetings.    That particular morning about quarter past seven I got the call to come to her office.  I then proceeded – I was situated on the 14 t h floor and she was on the 18 t h floor.  So I proceeded to her office and then on entering her office I found her there as well as Major General Bongani Ntanjana who is responsible for support services in the province comprising supply chain management, financial services and h uman resource management.  He is now deceased.  There was also Major General Fannie Masemola.  He was the provincial head of operational responsedealing with amongst other things the deployment of police officers in the province.  General Masemola is curr ently I think the Deputy National Commissioner at the rank of Lieutenant General.  Also seated there was Brigadier Lawrence Kemp whom I referred to earlier on as the head of financial services in the province as well as Colonel Navin Madhoe who was from supply chain management.  At the point was one of the subjects of the investigation who would allegedly colluded with Toshan Panday.      Chair it was quite an uncomfortable meeting.  General Ngobeni aimed her frustrations towards Brigadier Kemp and it soon became clear to me that she had either been misled or there was something seriously wrong because she went hammer and tong for Kemp and she accused him of b eingmore concerned about finances, money than the lives of – of the citizen – citizens.  And then the more Kemp tried to explain to her the more she interrupted him and she would admonish him and there was some argument – well not argument, some discussio n between the two of them relating to some reports that he had sent to national office and that – she almost out of control and then she had a go at him for communicating directly with head office which I could not understand what it had to do with what we  were busy with.  And the conversation carried on and eventually she – I just kept quiet.  And the reason why I kept…   No.    No, no Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Not at all Chair I did not have a – I did not even have an idea what was going to happen when I – when she called me.  I did not know what she was calling me for.    That is correct Chair.    She was speaking to Kemp but I got the feeling she was talking to me as well.     But not directing it at me.   Chair the main reason I did not want to say anything was the mere fact that one of th e main suspects in the investigation Colonel Navin Madhoe was part of the – of the meeting so I just kept quiet.  Then she at one stage said to me Johan what do you say?  So I said to her, General I feel uncomfortable talking – I will talk to you later.  And I do not know if she sensed why I felt uncomfortable but she then excused Kemp and she excused Colonel Madhoe.    What I recall Chair was that she – and that is why I felt she had either been misled by someone or else she knew what was going on and tried to make this thing off as if we – well she was talking to Kemp but by implication to myself as well that we were concerned about finances as supposed – as supposed to that we should be concerned about the lives of citizens.  And I – it did not really make sense to me and that is why I did not say anything.  And then…    There was adiscussion between her and Kemp about a report that he had sent to national head office.  I cannot recall that particular report did not have anything to do with our investigation.     No.    That is right.    No it did Chair.    Ja I think she – I do not know whether she confla ted two issues intentionally.   Or whether – but that whole meeting was – made no sense to me.    But it was evident to me that it related to the investigation that we were busy with.     Because we…    She was visibly upset.   That is correct Chair.    And that is what I tried to explain to her.    Now I – I do not know whether she tried to pretend that she did not know what was going on or whether she – well that was – those were my thoughts at the time whether she had been misled or whether she did not really grasp whatwas going on.  That is why I explained to her.  We are not concerned about the actual deployment what we are concerned about is the acquisition of the accommoda tion for the deployment.  Because it all seemed to go through the books of Toshan Panday.  Her response was once again the investigation must stop and then she said to General Bongani Ntanjana who is now deceased that he should commence with an investigation.  Now it did not make sense.    That is correct.    Chair.    No.    So Chair so she told Ntanjana that he should take over the investigation.  It did not make sense to me because General Ntanjana had not been a detective for many years number 1.  Number 2 is he did not have the capacity to deal with such an investigation.  He did not have the investigators to deal with such an investigation. As it would turn out later we had to employ forensic auditors.  So and in my mind it did not make sense to me that he should do the investigation.    Chair I – to me and my view that was a ruse.  It was a ruse to try and pacify me to indicate well there will be an investigation we are not going to sweep this under the carpet.  That is my view and it was actually my suspicion s were confirmed later on which I would allude to later on in my affidavit.  Sorry Chair and then she gave – she said to Ntanjana he must conclude his investigation within two weeks.     Chair there is no ways that even myself with the resources at my disposal at the time a number of investigators whose sole  function is to do investigations.  Whereas Ntanjana had none of those resources.  There is just – it is just impossible to conclude or finalise an investigation of that magnitude in such a short period of a time.     That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair about two weeks later Colonel Vassan Soobramoney then provided me with a follow-up report which is much more detailed than the initial report th at I had received from Kemp.  And from a reading of that report it was – it was very clear that there were irregularities and I would go as far as to say that those irregularities related to possible corruption and even fraud and perhaps other crimes as well.  So he provided me with – withthis report.    Chair it was about two weeks later.    This is the report Chair.    Chair I just want to confirm there are three paragraphs that are not numbered and then there are one set are numerically numbered.     Should I read 1?    Paragraph 2. “It is alleged that supply chain management from PHQ which will be Provincial Head Quarters Kwazulu Natal has from October 2009 to date utilised the services of Gold Coast Trading CC and settled claims in excess of R15 million.  On the little information given by  Brigadier Lategan we were required to determine a link between Toshan Panday and members of supply chain management from provincial headquarters.  However on Thursday the 6 May 2010 we were instructed by Brigadier Lategan to return the investigation file to provincial headquarters after he had received instructions to halt the investigations. Thus far our investigations have revealed the    It is called Tozers Bed and Breakfast at Bergville KwaZulu Natal Chair.      “The first claim was from 24 December 2009 to 6 January 2009.  The claims submitted and settled by SAP was for R113 400,00.  However the actual cost of the accommodation at Tozers Bed and Breakfast was R29 400,00.  The second claim from 6 January 10 to 22 January 2010 [6 nights for 6 members] for R172 800,00 was settled by the SAP.  Obviously the police.  The actual cost of the accommodation at Tozers Bed and Breakfast was only R33  600,00.  However with regard to the second part of the claim Toshan Panday made use of Tozers Bed and Breakfast to accommodate the members and no further members arrived as an addition to  the man –probably the main power requested for the detached duties.  However in the second part of the claim he submits that two late comers were accommodated at a cost of R43 200,00.  This amount is included in the R172 800,00 settled by the SAP.  Our i nvestigations revealed that only six members were deployed at Eskort for the required duties.  It would appear that this claim is false.”     Of the same report?    Paragraph 6. “In respect of the above deployment of six members to Eskort the total cost that the police would have incurred had they made bookings directly at Tozers B&B would have cost R63  000,00.  And then it says in brackets [R29 400,00 plus R33 600.00].  However by making use of Gold Coast Trading CC the SAP had to fork out R286 200,00 and then in brackets [breakdown of R113 400,00 plus R172 800.00]. An over expenditure of R223 200,00.  A statement has been obtained from the owner of Tozers Bed and Breakfast who submitted that he had chargedR350,00 per person per night.  However Gold  Coast Trading CC had billed the SAP R1  350,00 per person per night for eight members and not for six as submitted by Ms Tozer.”     In paragraph 13. “Our investigations has also revealed that Gold Coast Trading CC has submitted a tender of R55 million for accommodation for SAP members for the duration of the 2010 World Cup.  This tender needsurgent investigation.”  And which is the next paragraph?      “Our investigation also revealed that – that Gold Coast Trading is not registered as an agent to provide accommodation for [the grammar is not so]for co-operates thus qualifying for a com mission.”    Which starts with it is our submission?     “It is our submission that we would be able to prove fraud and or corruption in this matter.  We requireunhindered investigation in this matter and the call up instructions for all detached duties including the written request for the accommodation and other items mentioned above that was sourced by Gold Coast Trading CC.”    From reading the report Chair that is my interpretation.     That is correct Chair.   That is correct it was Aswin Narainpersad.    That is indeed so Chair.    I would go further than that Chair they were drastic infla – those prices were drastically inflated.    The longer version.    The Chair asked me if that report was directed at me.   Which I confirmed.    Although I am not a hundred percent sure whether it was written for me.     Or written for Dramat.    But be that as it may I only obtained that report at a much later stage.     From – from Soobramoney.    That is right Chair.   I am not sure.    I will have to speculate Chair.    I am not a hundred percent sure of that Chair.    Chair a Section 205 subpoena is which we acquire normally.  If – and I think it is originally written for recalcitrant witnesses who d o not want to testify so basically that Section 205 subpoena means you subpoena a person to come and answer questions to a prosecutor in a court of law.  But normally we also use the same Section 205 to acquire bank statement and alsotelephone records and whatever records we might need to legitimise the institution handing over those documents or files to us we have to obtain a Section 205 certificate – subpoena in terms of The Criminal Procedure Act.    That is so Chair.    Okay.    No Soobramoney – it was Soobramoney and Van Loggenberg.  Soobramoney was the lead investigator that stage.   Chair he was – he was actually the direct commander of the Commercial Crime Investigations so he was – he reported to me.    So I did not at – it was like following the protocol.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    that is right Chair.    Chair there is just something that I think …    Masimolo and myself.    That was the first meeting.    That is right Chair, that is right.    That is correct Chair.    I did Chair.  Between myself and some of the investigators that worked with me I cannot recall exactly who drafted the letter but we did report her conduct to the Law Society at the time.    Chair – Chair subsequent to that she did something else which I perhaps sequentially talk about later on.    Which was also reported to the Law Society and it is now a couple of years ago I was informed about a month ago to come and testify in Durban.  Two days before I had to go to that hearing I was told no they have remanded it indefinitely.   Because of the new     That is correct Chair.    Nothing happened after that Chair.    Chair at the time the current Minister of Police Mr Bheke Cele was the National Commissioner of Police.  I received a phone call from him and he enquired from me as to the interference that I was experiencing with the investigation.  So I briefly told him but I did not go into any detail because we were still busy with the investigation and he said to me that I should not entertain any interference and that I should continue with the investigation and he also said that the reporting lines should be the way it is defined in the police struct ures and that the investigator should report to me.  I suspect that General Dramat perhaps had brought that to his attention that there might be interference.  And that – that phone call gave me a lot of reassurance that I can – we cancontinue with the investigation unabated.    That is correct Chair.    That is the same.    That is the same investigation Chair.   That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That was the impression I gained Chair.    That is indeed so Chair.      Never stopped.    But what did change was the reporting – the reporting lines.    But as I said those were for just to get the pressure off me from the Provincial Commissioner.    That they reported to Brigadier Nkosi.    And the instruction from Mr Bheki Cele at the time who was the National Commissioner number 1 the investigation must cont inue that I should not entertain any interference and number 2 that we should adhere to the reporting lines within the police.    Yes Chair at some juncture during the investigation obviously that was after the issue about the Section 205 subpoenas had come up he challenged the validity of the Section 205 subpoena’s in the high court in KwaZulu Natal.  We obviously between myself and the investigating officers we opposed it in the high court and the court ruled in our favour that theSection 205 subpoenas were legitimately acquired.  Upon the initially filed notice of intention to appeal but he never prosecuted the appeal.     No I did not Chair.    I did not.    Chair that is indeed so.  So what happened is as a result of the information acquired via the Section 205 subpoenas the investigators were in a position to obtain – to apply for search warrants for the residences of  Toshan Panday, the businessman, Colonel Navin Madhoe, Captain Aswin Narainpersad and also for the Provincial headquarters in which I was based namely for the financial department, for the supply chain management department and for the department responsible for the deployment of police officers for instance in the World Cup soccer.  Those search warrants were obtained and I realised that if we were going to execute those warrantswith the Provincial Commissioner and the building that – that all hell might break lose so I – we – we devised a strategy and Chair it was very difficult with this investigation because information kept on leaking out.  No matter what precautions we tried to take.  So I instructed the investigators to assemble a team because we wan ted to do all the premises simultaneously.  Because once you start with one by the time you get to the last one all the incriminating evidence had been disposed of.    So it was the business premises of Toshan Panday, his residence – his – where he lived.  The residence of Madhoe, the residence of Narain Prasad and also their offices.  But as I said Chair also the financial department where we wanted to seize documents and also at the ORS that were responsible for the deployment of police officers.     That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair as I said that I was a bit concerned that if this whole team descended upon Provincial headquarters and started searching the offices it – there might be a small little nuclear explosion in the building so we devised this plan and what we did is we assembled a group of detectives from the DPCI and I instructed the investigators not even to tell the m what was going to be searched the following day.  They assembled the night before andwe targeted a specific day on which the Provincial Commissioner wanted me to accompany her to a parliamentary lekgotla. So the plan was…    The provincial one Chair.    So the plan was that I would accompany her the following morning and on entering the building I would get wind of the story that the offices are being searched but that was a plan that we had decided upon beforehand.     That is correct.    That was the – that is correct Chair.      So I would then inform her.    And I knew by then it would be too late because she cannot tell the politicians I am going now.   I have better things to do.    So what happened is the night before in spite of the fact that I told the guys not to tell them who we are going to search, whose residences we going to search the following day they assembled the foll owing morning at six o’clock. They waited for me to give them the…     The sign that we are about to enter the Lekgotla and that is when they started with the search.  I then informed the PC th at there was a search underway but by then we were both bogged down with the politicians.     So she could not do anything.    But in spite of the fact that we tried to keep it secret somehow and I had instructed the night before that they do not tell the searchers who was going to searched and in spite of that they told him although the people were selected.  The following morning it was clear that at least Mr Toshan Panday had been alerted that there was going to be a search executed on his premises.  In any event Chair all those premises were searched.  Whenthey came to Panday’s premises he was nowhere to be found at his residence.  They then phoned h im and he said to them no he was in Newcastle.  Chair Newcastle is probably about three and a half to four hours’ drive from Umhlanga Rocks. When the investigators indicated to him that they are going to wait there for him he arrived there about a half an hour later.  So he must have been in the vicinity and that is why we suspect he got wind of – well someone must have informed him that we were going to do those searches.  But be that as it may Chair a number of documents were seized from the respective pr emises, files, documents and computer files were confiscated from SAPS, from the various departments but one of the concerning matters was that the report that Vassan Soobramoney gave me, the – that is now the first one which I had given to the PC. She had  asked me for the copy and I had also given a copy to Ntanjana.  That same document was found on the – at the premises of Colonel Navin Madhoe.     One of the suspects Chair.    But Chair as I said earlier on I was – Soobramoney had given me the     The report.    He was not going togive it to the suspects.  I most certainly did not give it to the suspects.  The only two people I gave it to was …     And the Provincial Commissioner that is correct Chair.    I then first I approached the – Ntanjana and he assured me that he had nothing to do with it and even showed the copy that he still had.  I then went to the PC and I said to her lo ok this is what transpired and I feel very unhappy about it.  And she was very dismissive and she said ag anyone could have given it to them and she just like dismissed me as if …     That is the report Chair.    That is correct Chair.   That is correct Chair.    Chair as I said earlier on this second report     Sorry?    Okay.     Okay.      Okay so Chair what is contained in this – in this report I cannot recall the detail.    But I was aware of this.    That is correct Chair.    In paragraph 2 “Mr Toshan Panday owing to the vast amounts of profit generated from his dealings with the SAP managed to purchase a 2009 model Ferrari California at a purchase price of R2 million R2.5 million.  He paid a deposit of R510 000,00 the purchase of his car was done in the first week of May 2010.  A brief perusal of the Nedbank bank statements of Gold Coast Trading obtained via Section 205 reve als startling activities.  The bank account was opened in 2007 but the request forthe statements from January 2009 to 17 May was done.  The activity between January 2009 to October 2009 shows that Gold Coast Trading was actually struggling financially with several cheques returned unpaid or deliberately cancelled by the drawer.  However from the first payment received from the SAP on 20 November 2009 the financial woes of Gold Coast Trading came to an abrupt end.  It appears so profitable that from the 20 November 2009 to the 24 December 2009 the SAP paid R2.75043 million into the account of Gold Coast Trading.  The accommodation for during this period from the Nedbank account totalled R475 188,00.  On the 5 January 2010 the SAP paid the total in one payment of R1 303 460 that must be million into the account of Gold Coast Trading CC. On the 1 March of 2010 the SAP paid a total in one payment of…    So Chair the information on the report itself was information about that you could only have acquired by means of a 205 because it was…     So if they gave me a progress report with their bank details and I received it before the date of the application for the 205’s.    That means they already had the information.    And then they appliedfor the 205’s.    Chair I think it was asubtle means of trying to intimidate me.  He comes from supply chain management so I do not know.  I have seen plenty dead bodies I do not know how many he has seen being from supply chain management but I – like I say the photographs that I saw were all people that had been either shot by police or that were normal murder scenes.     That is correct Chair.    I told him I will speakto the investigating officer Chair.     Chair when I left that meeting…    I think it was both Panday and Madhoe’s bank details t hat was important.   Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is my view Chair.    Ja.   Which were vital toour investigation.    Chair when I left the meeting and as I said my office was basically two minutes away from there I immediately phoned the investigating officer well the – Soobramoney and Van Loggenberg and asked them to come to my office.  I also phoned Captain Pelser but Captain Pelser sits on the same floor that I – which I am sitting.  He is the coordinator for the Section 252A authorities.  So I told him meet me in my office I am on my way.  So on my arrival at the office Pelser was already  there and the investigators joined soon afterwards.  I explained to him exactly what had transpired at the Elangeni Hotel.  So I said to Pelser go and contact the DPP’s office so long and get us authority for in terms ofSection 252A of the CPA.  Now Chai r what normally happens with sting operations with the drug related matters we normally get verbal authority and then invariably I will get a call from the DPP’s office they still waiting for the affidavits.  In this particular instance I immediately went and sat down and drafted my affidavit as to what had occurred at the hotel.  It was sent through to the DPP’s office Advocate Nel who then authorised 252 engagement with Madhoe onwards.  I also told…     A very similar one.   That is right.  Because I did not know what would come of those initial di scussions about me assisting them.     I also said to the investigating officer that he should document everything that had transpired at the hotel in the actual docket for later references.  That same afternoon the DPP had authorised the Section 252 authorisation – it authorised the engagement with Madhoe.  Chair the following day I had a meeting at National head office and I first went…     I am now still inDurban.  So the following morning I first went to my office and cleared my desk and then to go to the meeting when I received a call and one of my other warrant officers from my office picked up the phone – my phone – my cell phone and he gave it me and he said to me it is Colonel Madhoe.  So I took the phone and Madhoe said to me I must come down to the basement of the building where our cars are parked.  So I went down and when I arrived there he was there in his car.  So I got into the car with him and he then said to me did I find my report?  And I lied to him, I said no I cannot find my report.  The one that they wanted me to alter.  So he lent over backwar ds and took an envelopefrom the backseat, a big brown envelope which he handed to me and he said to me the report – that report that you are looking for is inside this envelope.  The one I now had to put the date stamp on.      It is – no Chair that is – it just does not work like that in the police.     Where a Colonel calls a General down to the basement.    Ja.    Because we had the 252A’s in place.    Ja Chair the meeting happened on the day.    And early thefollowing morning I was preparing for a national meeting so that was not forefront in my mind.      I intended engaging him when I get – when I got back from Pretoria.    Well Chair depending what emanated from there a lot of things could have happened.  I did not know why he had called me down there.     But be that as it may we had a 252 in operation so.    It would have covered any eventuality that would have flowed from there on.     That is right Chair.    Chair then I – we had a general discussion I said to him you know things does not alwayscome for free or so – words to that effect and then he said no, no …     I said that.    Then he said to me, no Panday had – I think he said – ja Panday had two bar available for me for my cooperation.  Oh no he did not say that at that stage.  First what he said is, he said to me how much do I want?  Now Chair in my whole police career no-one has ever asked me what I want or something like that.    And it was very difficult to say the words.  So I said to him look what I am going to do is I am going to send you a text message and then I am going to put a figure there and then you can add a couple of noughts to which weagreed.  And then I left.  I then phoned the investigating officer and I said to him to come to my office immediately and I  gave – because I had my report.  I had lied to him about not having had it.  So I said to the investigating officer this Van Loggenberg I said to him, Hans take this thing send it to forensics see if you can find DNA or fingerprints on the envelope or what is inside the envelope which he did.  About a week later Van Loggenberg phoned me that the fingerprints found on the envelope was not those of – well now the fingerprints found inside on the document were not those of Madhoe the Colonel who had given it to me.  So I said to him, look where can we get a set of fingerprintsfrom Toshan Panday?  And he said to me come to think of it when they searched his premises earlier on there were a set of fingerprints lying there because he had applied for a firearm licence and they had taken that.  So I said to him well send that to the fingerprint department let them compare that.  And I think it was about a week after that he phoned me back and he said to me – it was late in the afternoon he said to me the report had  come back.  The fingerprints on the document – my progress report which was in the envelope the fingerprints matched those of Toshan Panday.      No.    No Chair I never opened it I gave it…    Just like that.    Ja I never opened it.    It was opened at the local criminal record centre by the fingerprint experts.     The same reportChair.    The same report.    No Chair so what happened the followed morning I then left to go home and back my bags and fly to Pretoria.  I flew to Pretoria and then the following morning I was actually sitting with General Dramat at – in the venue where we were having the meeting when I received a text message from Colonel Madhoe and he typed like the kids type nowadays with theseshort abbreviations.  Hi General did not know you had gone when you back that funny language and he said – and then he ended off the conversation with a 2 in brackets.  And then I – by then General Dramat was – had been alerted to my engagements with Madhoe so I still went and showed him the text message that I had just received.  And we actually joked about it because I thought they – they thought I was cheap because they were going to give me R20  000,00 for a R60 million investigation.  Chair okay after that I went back to Durban after the meeting.  I do not know if you want me to proceed after tha t?    Chair I did and all those conversations have subsequently been captured.     Between him and myself it forms part of the evidence in the docket.     The actual sms’s, the timelines have all been captured.    I am trying to find out where I am now.    Okay.  So Chair after that I…    Sorry?    So Chair and another engagement that I had with Ma dhoe and I must mention now simultaneous to my engagement with him we are also running the Act 70 interceptions.  So Colonel Padiachi from Crime Intelligence is tellingme exactly how they discussing – how they have…     Chair the docket that I am talking about …    That is the – and I am going to talk about that later in my evidence because that docket became a big issue eventually.    That docket as we speak is with Advocate Wendy O’Brian from the Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Durban because my understanding is that they are nowpreparing after seven years a prosecution in these matters and Chair it is vast volumes.    Okay.   So Chair the first meeting is at the hotel.    The second meeting is the following morning where he gives me the report in the envelope.     I then go to Pretoria.    Subsequent to that we had another engagement.  Most of the engagements were initiated by him.  And at a follow up engagement when we discussed now…     No it is in cars.   It was always in cars Chair.    Clandestine there in the basement.  These meetings took place in the basement.     There were other subsequent meetings that took place at McDonalds but this particular one took – also took place in the basement.   After I had returned from Pretoria I engaged with him again also in the basement.  He then gave me another hard drive in which he said there are more photos on the thing.      That is correct Chair.    No, no I was playing along with there Chair.    In terms of the 252.    Sorry Chair?   No not really Chair I just …    Chair and at one of these subsequent engagements he said to me,  no Toshan Panday had two bar available for my cooperation in this matter.     Two bar.  So I know what two bar is.   But I thought he does not know what two bar is because I – I mean no-one gives you R2 million.  So I thought maybe he is thinking R200  000,00.    So my understanding from the beginning was that they were going to give me R200  000,00 to sign that document and put a date on.     It was all in the space of a week, week and a half Chair.    The 2010 August 2010 Chair.    Then I thought it was R20,000,00,    Only put the 2 there Chair.    But then when he subsequently told me 2 bar then I thought no this man does not know what 2 bar is.    Maybe he is meaning R200 000,00.   Just one correction this is now in 2011.    Ja but he wanted a specific date.  And I took this very pen which I always carry with me and I took it out and I said to  him give me a piece of paper.  So he took out his wallet and he gave me a piece of paper and he gave me the date which I wrote down on the piece of paper.  So he said okay no that is fine.  Okay so now I will not forget.  When I left – when he left turned the piece of paper around and it was an ATM slip from his bank account.    So on my return back to my office I called the investigator and I said to him take this ATM slip and we can use it as an exhibi t later on because where would I have gotten his ATM slip?  So the investigators took that.  Chair the day before the actual sting operation I met him for the last time atMcDonalds at Gateway in Durban North.  I think we sat in my car and then we had a discussion as to where we going do this now?  Where they going to give me the money and I am going to give him this document.    That is right Chair.    Not yet Chair, not yet Chair.   So he wanted again he said to me I think he said we should go to the Japanese Gardens which is right next to Hyper by the Sea where the Jaypore Restaurant is.  So I said to him no let us rather go to the casino in the basement of the casino.  And the reason why I did that is because I know the people at the casino and I knew that they would be coope rative for us to use their CCTV footage.  And he agreed to that.  Then I said to him okay now how are we going to do this?  Now first of all he indicated to me that during one these discussions they could put the money in my kids account or put it in my fr iends account and I knew if we do a sting operation and money gets transferred to my account there is going to be no – no direct link.  So I still said to him no I wanted cash.  And I said to him at one stage I want it in R200,00 notes.  He later came back  and said to me no they – there is a problem with the R200,00 notes atthe bank which at the time was indeed so but I established later on that there was a different reason why they could not give me R200,00 notes.  So he said no they could only get R100,0 0 notes and R50,00 notes so I said it is fine.  And then the day before we said okay how are we going to do this?  I said – he said to me he is going to put it in a duffle bag.  I said no, no do not put it in a duffle bag why do you not rather get some photocopy boxes from your office put the money inside there.  And that is what we agreed to do.  And then I said to him okay what I will do is I will give you the document in the morning then you give me the 150 and…   No, no this is now at McDonalds.    In the car Chair.    So I said to him give me – you give me the 150 I will then give you the document then if you are happy with it you can pay me the balance of the 50 in the afternoon.  Then he said to me hey I said R2 million what did you think?  Then it dawned upon me he is act ually talking about R2 million.  Then I said no, no that is what I thought.  But I really thought it was R200 000,00.  Then it really dawned on me it is actually R2 million.  So Chair then we departed.  I left from there I went straight to the casinowhere I spoke to a Mr Christo Van Rooyen who is in charge of surveillance there.  I told him look we are busy with an operation they must make sure that those cameras are all working and we agreed everything.  Chair the…     That is correct Chair.    So after I hadarranged with Mr Van Rooyen at the casino I went home.  During that week the Provincial Commissioner was away in Pretoria and I was the – being the Deputy she had appointed me as the acting Provincial Commissioner so I was wearing two hats in the – during that week.  I have to add Chair every single meeting that I had with Madhoe was done by prior arrangement with the DPP’s office.  They were informed except the one time when he called me down to the basement there was not time to – but I immediately informed them afterwards.  But every other engagement before I would go I would inform Pelser, Captain Pelser he would inform the DPP’s office they would record it accordingly and I would inform the investigating officer in the main corruption docket.  After I had engaged with Madhoe I would once again phone Pelser back and gave him feedback verbally on the phone and I would phone the investigating officer and tell him to diarise in his diary exactly what had happened on that day.  On the day that the stingoperation was set to be done that – I think that was the one and only time that I engaged him, the initiative came from me.  So I phoned him in the morning I said to him look I am ready for this now, meet me in the basement.  So I met him in the basement of Provin cial headquarters, police headquarters.      Ja it is on the 8September Chair.    2011 now Chair.    So Chair now I – I had to play with time because I had to get people in position and  unfortunately – well why I had to get people in position we were ready to go to the casino.  He then tells me all of a sudden no, no, no he does not want to go to the casino because there might be cameras.  So it put – I was off guard now because now I had to change my plans very quickly.  So he once again suggested the Japanese – I said – the Japanese Gardens.  I said hey why do we not just do it here in the basement?  And he said to me are you okay with that?  I said no I am okay with that.  So I said to  him look I am the acting Provincial Commissioner I am very busy so let me go up and just sort out thecorrespondence and the meeting and then I will phone you when I am ready.  But the idea was for me now to get all the detectives in place.     That is correct Chair.  So in the building where I work if you stand across the road you can look up into the basement area.  It is not closed off.  So I said to him I am going to reverse my car in so that would make it easier for whoever is going to observe us from the bottom to see what was happening.  So I said I am going to reverse my car in and then you reverse in next to me and then we can do the business in the basement.  And he agreed. I went upstairs at that stage Colonel Len Sheriff he dealt with that particular operation.  I phoned him I said to him Len you guys need to get in place we are not going to the casino any longer this is going to happen in – at Provincial headquarters in the – in the basement.  So they hurriedly had to change their plans.  They got people into position on the fire escape, at the exit to the building and they also had people across the road to observe now how the transaction takes place and then it was roundabout 12 o’ clock when the Sheriff phoned me and he said to me they are in place now.  So I phoned Madhoe and I said to him okay I am ready to come down and meet you and I thought he – I thought he was still some distance away and he said to me no, no, no.  I am here already.  So I thought I hope he did not see all the activity around the building but fortunately it is a very business/business area.  So he did not pick up the activity of the people getting into position.  So Chair just before I left the office  my brother who is a privatedetective walked in and he said to me – I said Marius I cannot talk now. I am busy with a sting operation and he is one of these gadget guys and he said to me have you got a camera and I said no.  He said do you want one.  I said yes and he gave me a key holder with a camera in and there was no time to do a crash course in how the camera worked.  I just said switch it on and leave it on.  So I took this thing and I walked obviously now with the document which I had endorsed whic h I put in an envelope.  Got into the lift and one of the Generals was in the lift with me.  One of the ladies not the PC and she was talking to me on the way down and my mind was somewhere else and we both exited onthe same floor and we walked out but as  I walked out I noticed my car is standing there and his car  is not next to mine.  So as I got into the basement I looked to my left and his car was standing there and he was halfway out of the car.  So he alighted from the vehicle and the General walked to her right and he said to me it is safe here and I knew if we were going to do it there the people across the road would not see us because I was going to touch my head as a single for them to pounce.  So I just carried on walking towards my car and I sa id no, no come and park your car next to mine and I had this camera on the whole time and so he reversed in next to my car and he waited for this other General to disappear from our sight.  He then got out of the car, walked to the boot of his car, opened the boot of his car.  I opened the boot to my car.  He then took out which appeared to be a brand new suitcase.  So he put it in the boot of my car and because the arrangement was that he would come with boxes I still asked him - and that is all recoded.  Isaid where did you get this and he said I bought it and the way he spoke I could not.  I said what.  He said I bought it.  He bought it.  I said okay but now I am scared that they were going to try and bamboozle me.  So I said to him he must open the sui tcase I want to see the money because I was scared there might be bricks or something else in the suit – he had a little lock and he opened it – he opened it and it was packed with notes.  So I said to him okay close it, closed my boot and I took the envelope and I opened and I slid the piece of paper out like that and it is all on camera and I am actually holding the camera in his face now and I read the date and the stampthere to him and he said to me hundreds as we.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair.    Chair as I said I joined in 1976 those days you had to write exams to become an officer as opposed to today where you have to apply for a certain post so I went through the – the processes of writing the necessary examinations.  I eventually bec ame a commissioned officer in 1987.  Subsequent to that your promotions are according to where you finished off on the candidate officer ’s course.  With the new dispensation in 1995 there was a different process.  I held the rank of aLieutenant Colonel just prior to the new democratic institution.  A few weeks later I was promoted to the rank of full Colonel and subsequent in the new dispensation I was promoted inter alia to the rank of a Brigadier and a Major General.    Chair if one could go back to the previous, the previous slide.  It actually shows the lineation of the actual command structure isolating from the National Head of theHawks to his National Office.  Under him at National Office he had certain component heads whereas in the second slide I delineated the rank structure from National Head to myself as a Provincial Head and then the different components in the Province that reported to me.     That is right Chair.    Mr Chair in my view the one cannot do without the other.  They all form very important gears in this big machinery and if anyone of those are absent the whole Justice System will be compromised in my view Chair.     That is correct Chair.    Chair I was just prior to that appointment the then Scorpions were dissolved.  I was then the Head - at that particular time I was the Head of Organised Crime in KwaZulu-Natal and prior to that I was the Head of Serious and Violent Crime.  Serious and Violent Crime and Organised C rime eventually amalgamated and I was then the Head of Organised Crime prior to my appointment as Head of the Hawks.    That is indeed so Chair.    Chair if I may just clarify that.  In police parlour we refer to support functions Human Resources, Finance - Financial Departments etcetera which I was also responsible for.    But there were other sub components which I would rather call them that resorted under my command.    Which are inter aliaSerious Commercial Crimes, Serious Organised Crime and the Asset Forfeiture Investigation Units.  Although the Asset  Forfeiture Units were actually ran by an advocate from the National Prosecuting Authority they also had an investigative capacity which reported to me.     Chair with regards toSAPS.  Crime Intelligence is a component of SAPS, of the South African Police Services and so are the Hawks, the DPCI.  They are an integral part of SAPS where supposed to IPID.  They are not an entity of SAPS.  They are an independent e ntity and they work on their own.    Chair I regard my evidence that I will give to this Commission as being part of the police structures for about 40 years of my life until I retired and more specifically to events more recently from around about 2010.     Chair it is my view that for reasons that I will elaborate on further in my evidence.     That certain elements – and not all of them – certain elements within the La w Enforcement and the National Prosecuting Authority had been captured for.     For reasons of own interest and in other cases to, to promote or to follow a particular agenda or narrative.    For – at the behest of political – people with political power.    Or in some instances from politicians who were directly involved.     Chair I regard myself as a born policeman.  It was my passion my whole life.  It was not a jobfor me.  It was a passion.  I had an unblemished career.  I had received numerous national awards from the various National Commissioners in the previous dispensation and in the current dispensation.  I have received a number of awards at Provinc ial level and I was also recognised by the previous Head of Interpol and up until the events that unfolded roundabout 2010 I had an unblemished career.     Indeed Chair.    Chair I have no doubt in my mind that the trigge r for the change in my experience in the police came about roundabout 2010 when I initiated a corruption investigation relating to the business of a wealthy businessman in KwaZulu-Natal by the name of Toshan  Panday and his links with certain senior police officials.    That is correct Chair.    That is so Chair.    Chair normally at senior management level we have management meetings every morning at provincial level.  During those meetings those meetings are chairedby the Provincial Commissioner, so Deputies and then all the senior officers from the respective components for instance the Financial Department.    Chair at that stage I was Head of the Hawks.  At the rank ofGeneral.    During those meetings it is first a general meeting regarding the crime in the province the previous night and the previous day and thereafter we discuss financial issues, human resource issues, supply chain management issues etcetera.  On 28 April just before the meeting commenced I was approached by a Brigadier  Lawrence Kemp who was the Head of Financial Services in KwaZulu-Natal Province and he indicated to me that they had discovered that there appears to be some irregularities with regards to an acquisition of certain services.  So I asked him at that meeting could he prepare something in writing for me and then give it to me.  The following morning before the same meeting he came up to me and he gave me a copy of a report that he had compiled and he had also placed one in front of - at that juncture the ProvincialCommissioner had not arrived at the meeting yet.  So he had al so placed one in front of her – her empty seat.  For some reason I took that one away and I asked Kemp to just let me have a look at it before we, we actually distribute the report.     Chair he actually – she was late that morning.    That is right.   That would have been Lieutenant General Mmamonnye Ngobeni.    That is right Chair.  That particular morning she was late Chair.    And what.    So while we were standing around he gave me a copy of the report.     And he placed one in front of her empty chair.    So.    So I took that one.    And I said to him Lawrence just give me a day or two to see what is going on here because I quickly read through it and I said just give me a day or two to see what is happening.    Nevertheless after that particular meeting I went back to my office and I called in Brigadier Andre Lategan who was the Head of Commercial Crime in the province at that point in time.  So I gave him the report and I said to him he should have the matter investigated and then inform me what, what was going on.  So he – Chair also what we do is in the police normally when a case gets registered it goes on what we call the CAS system.  That is when a docket is opened, but what we do in the police especially with your more covert investigations beca use police officers have access to the CAS System they can establish when corruptioncases or any other case for that matter in which they could possibly be implicated in if a case had been registered.  So what we sometimes do we register on the same syste m an inquiry.  Without, without specifying what it is all about.  So once all the evidence is eventually gathered to convert it to an officia l docket we will then convert that inquiry into a criminal investigation docket.    Although the enquiry is actually also part of the criminal investigation.     The CAS System.    C-A-S.  So Criminal Administration System.    They, they would Chair but what. Because of the requirements in registering a criminal docket.     You have to fill in every aspect of.    Of what is required to have the docket registered.    As opposed to an inquiry.    You do not have to go into that detail.  So it is very difficult for a policem an who wants to go and see if there is a case being investigated against him or her.     To go and fish around to see if there is an investigation.     Chair so.    Brigadier Lategan.    Lategan.   That is correct Chair.    So what he did Chair is he booked the investigation out.  At that point it was to a Colonel Hans Van Loggenberg and Colonel Vassan Soobramoney.  They were the two lead investigators in that particular investigation.     Chair on face value and looking at the initial report from, from Brigadier  Kemp.  On face value it was clear that there had been some irregularities in supply chain management at provincial level in KwaZulu -Natal.    That is correct Chair.    The indications were that all transactions during the World Cup  period preceding the World Cup and even after the advent of the World Cup just about every transaction had gone through the books of one particular businessman in KwaZulu-Natal which was Toshan Panday.    I work with supply chain management.  It was part of my function and financial management.    So it just looked odd and suspicious.  I mean blankets, television sets, accommodation.  I can give you perhaps an example.  Police headquarters – the Hilton Hotel is situated about two blocks away from police headquarters.     When a senior officerfrom police national head office had to come and visit in KZN  although the hotel was right next to – well two blocks away from where we were it still went through the books of the businessman in Umhlanga Rocks.  So it just seemed out that.    So what happened is Chair the procurement process is defined in the Treasury Regulations, over and above an amount you have to get tenders.     There is a certain amount which people at different levels can authorise themselves.     And then there is also a lower level and I cannot recall what it is called.  It  is not tenders.   Quotations that is right.  We have to get quotations and then you need to – and then also there is a database in terms of BEE so it gets allocated.  So there are certain processes.   That must be followed.   And it appeared from that initial report that those processes were not  followed.    If I can give a practical example Chair.    In my capacity as Head of the Hawks.  If I wanted to visit any place in the country I fill in an itinerary.  I will send it to at the time the National Head General Anwa Dramat.  He will authorise it and off I go.  My secretary will do my booking at the hotel.  She will do my transport arrangements etcetera.  In this particular instance officers visiting from national head officetheir accommodation was procured and acquired via the busines sman in Umhlanga Rocks.    Chair strictly speaking I would not have had a problem if it was one or two occasions.     Because invariably we also make use of especially when it comes to travelling.    Certain agencies.    But in this particular instance it appeared that everything from buying of television sets for police stations, blankets for the cells, cell mattresses.     Accommodation for people coming from national head office.   But the actual problem related to the acquisition of accommodation for the deployment of police officers during the World Cup, the World Cup So ccer.    That was the majorpart of.  Of the concern because although it went through the books of one or two close corporations.  Those close corporations were all registered in the name of one person.   Which wasToshan Pandya.    Chair at that juncture he had already registered the en quiry and I was continuing with my daily tasks and there were different departments reporting to me.  So obviously there are a number of investigations which are reported to me but over and above that I am also seized with other matters such as human resource management like I have explained before.   The two chief investigators as I said was Colonel Hans Van Loggenberg andColonel Vassan Soobramoney Chair.    Chair the registration is actually an administrative function. So I do not know whether it was Lategan himself or either the two investigato rs but that was just an administrative function although I mention in my statement or this diagram that Lategan was responsible for that.     Chair I can recall this vividly.  I was driving in my car.  I just exited the city and I was on, on the freeway on my way home in Amanzimtoti which is on the South Coast when I received a call from the then Provincial Com missioner Mmamonnye Ngobeni and I could hear from her voice she was irritated and she said to me Johan what is this investigation you are busy with and I said to well General which one are you talking about.  There are a number of investigations that we ar e busy with and then she said no the supply chain management one and then I started explaining to her but she kept on interrupting me and she said to me no, no, no.  We already have these problems at Mountain Rise Police Station.  The police are – it is an embarrassment to the police.  Now she was referring Chair to - at that point in time there was an investigation pertaining to the manipulation of police statistics which eventually culminated in the prosecution of a number of senior officers at Mountain R ise and it wasquite prominent in the media.  So she said to me no we already have this problem at Mountain Rise and now further investigation – we are just going to embarrass the police more and that you must stop the investigation.    It was clear in my mind that she was talking about this particular investigation against Toshan Panday.  She then abruptly terminated the call Chair and that is basically what happened on my way home.  She told me to stop theinvestigation.    No, no.  Well ja that is what she said.    That is right.  That is right.    Chair maybe at that point I had only been in that position for about two or three months.    So that was the very first.    Or only supply chain management or investigation that I  had been involved in.    Relating to our own department.  Absolutely.  Absolutely not.    Chair.    She did not Chair.  As a matter of fact she hardly gave me time to speak.  As soon as I would start to try and explain she just cut me off and she was  adamant.  She just said no the investigation must stop.  She did not ask me what it was about, what the magnitude was or what it involved.  She said to meI must stop.    That is correct Chair.    That is indeed so Chair.    Chair she, she had the right to give me instructions but most definitely not to stop an investigation.  That in my view was an unlawful instruction.     That is correct Chair.    Not when we had the conversation.    Chair not when we had the conversation in the car.     Chair it’s quite simple, once a docket had been opened it can only, it can be closed invarious ways, and I’m going to try a nd keep it as simple as possible.  If there’s a housebreaking case it gets investigated, fingerprints are taken, witnesses are interviewed but if no suspects are identified and it’s a dead-end case the case will be closed by a police officer as undetected, and it remains open for a period of time depending on the nature of the investigation, if it’s a housebreaking case after five years they might destroy the docket, if it’s a murder case it remains open indefinitely.  When there’s a suspect in the matter l ike in this particular instance where names are mentioned of people that had ostensibly committed criminal offences there is no authority within SAPS to close or stop an investigation, that docket must be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority to a  Prosecutor who will then weigh the evidence and decide whether he is going to prosecute a person or an individual or not.  If he so find that there are reasons, lawful reasons why a prosecution should not proceed, for instance if there was a case ofassault but the person acted in self defence that Prosecutor may then decide to noli prosecute or decline to prosecute in a manner, and he will endorse a docket as such.  The docket will be sent back to the police station and the Branch Commander of a certain r ank will then close that docket, so with regards with closing of dockets where there are suspects it must be by the – consequent to a decision of a prosecutor.  No police officer has the authority to summarily close a docket or stop an investigation, unles s if there are suspects indicated indicated in the investigation.     Chair the next day after the management meeting in the morning I called in Brigadier Lategan and I said to him Andre we’ve got a problem here, the PC ...(intervention)      Not at this meeting.     So Chair so I called in Lategan to my office and I said to him Andre we’ve got a bit of a problem here, and in police parlance we refer to the Provincial Commissioner as a PC, I said the PC has given an instruction that we must stop this investigation so we need to stop the investigation and he frowned and couldn’t understand based on what and he questioned, andI said well Andre let’s – bring back the file and then let’s see how things develop and he left my office and he was obviously not happy, I suspect at a later stage and I think Lategan and even Soobramoney and a few other people also thought that I was in cahoots trying to suppress the investigation, nevertheless he left the office and he later on came back with a file to my office.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s right Chair.     That’s right so it emerged during the investigations that they’ve made enquiries to Supply Chain Management and at the Financial Department so we suspected that ...(intervention)     Well some of the people at Supply Chain Management formed part of the investigation and we suspected that they perhaps alerted her that we were busy with this investigation.    Chair as I said in my view that was obviously an unlawful instruction and you have to understand and I saw Mr McBride also testifying about it yesterday, in the Police if something like that is going on and you go in the opposite direction you’re dead in the water.  Although in my mind I was never going to stop that investigation, that’s why I said to Lategan let’s see how this thing develops because I also know that the  National Head of the Hawks at that juncture was Dramat, Anwar Dramat, and I had no doubt in my mind that he was not going to be party to having the investigation stopped.     So I was banking on his support later on, but initially I had to take the file back from him.      That is so Chair.    Chair it actually went beyond that, what would happen is, and in this particular instance it did happen, people like Brigadier Kemp, Lategan, anyone who had been involved with that investigation would be ostracised by the ProvincialCommissioner and she would take it out on them and not everyone has ...(intervention)      That’s right Chair, so I in a way I had to protect my investigators, but that did not mean that I was in agreement that the investigation should stop not at all.      Chair I was in my dining room when I received a call on my cellular phone from the same Provincial Commission Ngobeni and she was very irritated and she actually shouted at me, she said to me “Johan I told you people to stopthis investigation” so I said to her but General it has been stopped and she said no what’s wrong with you people, or words to that effec t, and she said no the investigation – so I tried to convince her no the investigation had stopped and then I said look let me phone Brigadier Lategan and confirm with him, so we terminated the call, I phoned Brigadier Lategan and I phoned her back and I s aid to her look I’ve spoken to Lategan and he says they’re not continuing with the investigation and she appeared to be happy with that response.      Chair the first call in my car and then the second call?      Chair I would have to guess, it’s about between two and three weeks.      That’s correct Chair.     Chair I had no idea but I suspected at that juncture was because certain individuals from Supply Chain Management, such as a Colonel Navin Madhoe, who had a close relationship with the Provincial Commissioner, I suspected that he got wind of the story that there was an investigation and that he had alerted her to the investigation.  It later emerged during the investigation that there was a particular motive for her actions in that regard.     Chair I don’t get the question.  No I did not immediately Chair.     So Chair we often have national meetings for various reasons, and I can’t recall the date but it was not too soon after what had occurred that we had a NationalMeeting with a component, well with the Provincial Heads with General Dramat at the Burgerspark Hotel in Pretoria and we started the meeting and at the first tea break he came and stood next to me and we were h having tea and he asked me what is this story about this investigation that’s been stopped ...(intervention)      Dramat, General Dramat.     So I assumed at thetime that, and I suspect, not that I blame them for that, that it is either Van Loggerenberg or Soobramoney, and Soobramoney later told me that it was indeed him, I don’t know whether they phoned him or whether they went to see him and told him about what had happened, so I said to him well General I am a bit of a pickle here because the Provincial Commissioner is adamant that we stop this investigation and he wanted to know from me but why and I couldn’t explain why.  Then  I made a suggestion to him I said, although – and I said to him there’s clear indications that there are irregularities and then I said that’s on the one hand and on the other hand she is adamant that we stop the investigation.  Then I made a suggestion t o him that we continue with the investigation, that – with the same investigating officers, but that they should then report to his office ostensibly whereas I would surreptitiously remain involved with the investigation, to which he agreed.  He then appointed a Brigadier Nkosi, who at the time was working at the office of Serious Economic Offences, to “monitor” the investigation, so – but I suspect in any event that Soobramoney and Van Loggerenberg had in any event continued with the investigation, because when we got together again it was clear to me that they had actually continued with it.     That was the case Chair and the idea with that was if I had any further problems with the Provincial Commissioner trying to interfere or to stop that I could just tell her look it’s not in my hands, you have to speak to Dramat, and I knew she would never confront Dramat  with something like that.     That’s correct Chair.    When she excused Kemp and Madhoe I said to her, General I do not think you understand what is going on here.  We are not concerned about the deployment of police officers because that is the impression that was being created that we are concerned about paying for the deployment of police officers.  I said to her we are not concerned about the actual deployment of these police officers what we are concerned about is what concerns us as investigators it would appear that all the acquisitions of – of accommodation and other issues as well were going through the books of one businessman In Umhlanga Rocks.  And I said to her it is clear that there is = there is something amiss here.  Her response to that was once again…     Paragraph 16. “The invoices submitted by Gold Coast Trading CC do not have a VAT number and could possibly not be registered for VAT. This matter has to be reported to SARS for investigation as well.”     Navin Madhoe that is correct Chair.    Absolutely Chair.    [Intervenes].    That is correct Chair.    Chair the first report that I have just read out from.   That was submitted to me by Soobramoney two - about two weeks after I was told to stop the investigation.    The fact that he had given me the report imputes that we were still on the same score that that I was still supervising the inves tigation albeit surreptitiously.    It was two weeks, two weeks after the meeting Chair.    Where she – where Kemp and company were present and she told Ntanjana to investigate.  So.    This report came two weeks after that.  Chair I thinkAdvocate September had alluded to it earlier on that whilst I was preparing the statement of mine that I was writing it from my recollection of what occurred.    And sometimes things are not perfectly in sequence here.     So I – if my memory serves me correctly I only spoke to Dramat a bit later.  If my memory serves me correctly. Chair if I could perhaps just assist.    These reports – and I will perhaps speak to this later on in my evidence.     A number of reports and statements had gone missing from the dockets.     And a number of these reports I had to acquire from the investigators.  Some of them who subsequently required a number of the documents that are attached.     Were documents that I duplicated at the time which I kept.     In a safe location.    So the only way thatwe will be able to get.    Unless they go to the prosecutor who is currently seized with this matter in KZN and ask her.     But I understand even from her that various documents and reports have gone missing from the - those dockets.    Paragraph 13.    Paragraph 13.“It has also been established that the target at Provincial Headquarters has the authority to sign off acquisitions to the maximum of R200  000.”  That could be Colonel Navin Madhoe.    Paragraph 14, the third sentence. “The target at Provincial Headquarters manipulated the system by ensuring that the claims were split as not to exceed the R200 000 limit.  In actual factGold Coast Trading CC submitted a weekly claim for long detached duties.  A schedule of payments is available to prove this theory.”     Paragraph 15   Have we gone – have we actually discussed that meeting?     Chair I am not so sure.    I am not too sure if we have covered that yet.    Of, of the same report?    Paragraphs 16 and 17?    Paragraph 16   “In order for any success to be achieved the investigation team must be allowed to investigate  this matter unhindered and also to report directly to Lieutenant General Dramat or any senior officer appointed by him.”    That is so Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair there were no prescribed.    Periods on which they.    We – it was done in a solitary fashion.    Chair I do not know whether I have covered this in my evidence or not yet with regards tothe earlier report which I received two weeks.     I would just like to clarify that first before I go into this report.     So Chair the report that I am referring to there is the report in EXHIBIT ZE.     Page 5.    That is correct Chair.    Now Chair that report when Vassan Soobramoney gave me that report I wanted to use that report to exert pressure on the PC, Ngobeni.     So I went up to her office with this report and I said to her General I have got a follow up report from the investigating officers – from Soobramoney – and it is clear from this report that we cannot just sweep this under the carpet.  She then asked me for a copy of this repor t and I specifically mention this which will become evident later why I am mentioning this now.    Unless the evidence leader wants me to deal with that now.     So she says to me give me a copy of that report.    Now Soobramoney gave me – Soobramoney is the IO.  He has compiled the report.  He gave me a copy.    So she says to me she wants a copy of the report.    Ntanjana – by thenshe also summonsed Ntanjana because I said to her because I suspected that Ntanjana had not done anything.     About the so called investigation.    She summonsed him to her office.    Asked him how far theinvestigation had gone and he had some obscure.     Explanation he is waiting for a document, but it was clear that absolutely nothing had been done about the investigation.     Then I told her.    That is right.    So.    Ja and it was clear to me that he had not even commenced with anything whatsoever.    So - and I made it clear to them that this re port from Soobramoney.    We cannot just leave this.  Then she asked me for a copy of the report and so did Ntanjana.     I made two copies.  I gave one to Ngobeni and one to Ntanjana.    No not from my side Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I, I suspect and I am speculating.    I think Soobramoneyat this juncture thought Booysen is also in with the PC.     So he – I suspect that he gave this to Dramat.    Because I think they suspected that I am also involved in covering up.     The investigation.    Chair various events unfolded after this which will become clear in m y evidence.    And my interactions with Soobramoney.    And I do not want to pre-empt what my evidence is going to be later on.  With regards to meetings I had with the PC and instructions that were given with regards to, to Soobramoney.    But.    Soobramoney knew that I had their back.  All those investigators knew that I had their back.   And I made it abundantly clear to them.     That I will, I will protect them in the investigation and I think I have proven that throughout the investigation.    Can I just check where about we are in my, in my statement?     That is correct Chair.    Chair.    Chair I was called to the Provincial Commissioner’s office.    And so I took the lift and I went to her office and she has an office with an adjourningboardroom which are separated.  There is a door between the two and I entered the office and she asked me to go with her into the boardroom.     So she go up from behind her desk and I got up and she opened the door.  We went into the boardroom and on entering the boardroom I notic ed a lady who was introduced to me as Tasha  Giyapersad.    Giyapersad.    She was an attorney.  Then there was another gentleman whom I recognised as being Advocate  Mkhize.    I recognised.    It is G-I-Y-A-P-E-R-S-A-D.    The one gentleman there I recognised as being Advocate  Mkhize and I had engaged with him before in police matters – in High Court matters.  So he obviouslyknew me and he stood up and greeted me and then I was introduced to a gentleman by the name of Toshan  Panday.    That is right.    Toshan Panday. Chair during this meeting and I felt very uncomfortable during this meeting because I now realised that Toshan  Panday was one of the main subjects of this investigation that we were busy with and it was almost as if he chaired the meeting.  He accused.    No.    Not at all.    Not at all Chair.    Not at all.    Chair this was no ordinary meeting.    That is why I say it almost like Toshan Panday was chairing the meeting.    No they started by – obviously everyone by now knew about the investigation.    So he started by making allegations that – and his attorney started talking and then he would interrupt her and they were asking questions about the investigation what mandate do we have and they even said that.     No Chair.    No.   Chair I felt a lot like I had been ambushed.    That is how I felt.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    And they levelled these allegations and I was for lack of a better description trying to do some shadow boxing around the allegations and I just wanted to get outthere.  One of the allegations that they came up with was that Soobramoney was extorting money from P anday.  So to my amazement the Provincial Commissioner who had already instructed me to stop this criminal investigation now tells me to investigate – she tells me to investigate my investigator - Soobramoney – for the so called extortion.  So I indicated to the people that I can only investigate if they give me an affidavit which Giyapersad undertook to supply to me. She did subsequently – well maybe if I could just finish with this, with this meeting Chair.    So during this meeting as I said I was peppered with questions and I had to negotiate my way through trying to avoid talking about specifics.  I dealt with the accusations and told them well I cannot see them accessing b ank statements etcetera unlawfully because they would not be able to utilise that as evidence at a later stage and that is after instruction was given that I should investigate Soobramoney the meeting was then.     That was the end of the meeting Chair.     That’s correct Chair.      Chair as I said Panday was carrying on there like he  was the ...(intervention)   The Provincial Commissioner.     And he was going like this and he said to Giyapersad, I want you to sue th em, I’m going to sue you, it was actually quite, I was actually quite annoyed with theway in which he carried on there as if he was the Provincial Commissioner.     No she didn’t.     She sat there and listened to a suspect interrogating me about an investigation.      Chair I had quite a cordial relationship with Mkisi because of our previous engagements.      But he was merely a spectator and I must say – and he also passed on subsequently.     Chair it didn’t make sense to me, either at the time and still doesn’t make sense to me, he – they said we had no mandate to investigate, I don’t know what he meant by that, whether we had to seek authority from the Provincial Commissioner or whether we had to get prior authority from whomever to investigate but they said that my people did not have a mandate todo this investigation.    That’s correct Chair but there was another accusation as well and that was that my investigators were accessing bank statements unlawfully.    And I made it clear to them I doubt that they would do something like that becaus e they would then not be able to utilise those bank statements as evidence in the Court of Law.       That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair it was starting to become clear to me that something was amiss, so I – as a matter of fact I didn’t even want to talk to her after that I just excused myself and went to my office.     Paragraph?     Chair I refer to a forensic audit report by Price Waterhouse Coopers which is anindependent firm of accountants whom we had commissioned to do a independent forensic investigation into the financial aspects of the procurement and the payment of the money but even before I acquired this report from Price Waterhouse Cooper the investigators had reported to me – and that was during the same period that the investigation was being stopped and I think it was late May that there had been a birthday party for the hus band of the Provincial Commissioner, it was a surprise birthday party and the investigators informed me that this party had been paid for by Toshan Panday, it was a lavish party in a hotel in Umhlanga Rocks.  So those reports hadalerted me that there was something amiss here.     Chair the figure quoted was R30 000.00 but there were other statements in the investigation which indicated that the party actually cost R20  000.00 and when Panday paid for it with his credit card he asked for a receipt of R30 000.00 I don’t know wha t his intentions were to obtain a receipt for a higher amount but it would appear that the actual amount paid was R20 000.00 whereas the receipt obtained by him was for R30 000.00.     That is correct Chair but before I had this report the investigators had already indicated to me that there was this party for which Panday had paid.      That’s right.   I think it was towards the end of May Chair roundabout the 29 t h of May.     That’s right Chair.     Chair what I can say about that there’s another witness who had deposed to an affidavit that – it’s one of the secretaries of the Provincial Commissioner and she made a statement, which I have a copy of and which she says, I think it was on the 26 t h of May, the Provincial Commissioner, during the morning meeting, I wasn’t present at that meeting, then indicated therewas going to be this party – surprise party for her husband and that she would invite certain individuals and she apologised to those present that she could not invite all of them for obvious reasons and she still indicated to one of the brigadiers, according to the statement, Brigadier Winkelman that it’s not because I don’t like you if I don’t invite you it’s because of other constraints but the significant part of what occurred there was what happened after the meeting because the secretary then went to the Provincial Commissioner and asked her th ose that’s going to be invited, are the spouses also invited and it’s at that point where the Provincial Commissioner looked at the minutes and saw that she had recorded the issue about the party and then she remonstrated with her for having recorded that as part of the minutes and that was on the 26 t h.  So it would appear that there had been preparations for the party prior to that.     Which meeting are we referring to Chair?  Not during the meeting Chair but before we met, and I omitted to mention it before we went in she confirmed with me that the investigation had stopped before...(intervention).  No that it hadstopped.      So I confirmed with her that it had stopped because it did not but that’s just before we entered the boardroom.     That’s correct Chair.     No Chair I think she was referring to the investigation that we were busy with that, that had stopped.    Because we were now going to enter into a meeting with Panday and company and I think she just wanted to get clarity from me before we entered there that the investigation had stopped.      No by then she had already told me on more than one occasion to stop it so before we entered she asked me has the investigation – has it stopped so I saidto her yes.     No I did not say that Chair.     No she didn’t.    That’s correct Chair.     Chair then she said to me that I should investigate Colonel Vassan Soobramoney.   I did Chair, I requested then for an affidavit and I think it was a day or two laterTasha Giyapersad, the attorney arrived at my office w ith a statement, just like a half page it wasn’t even a full page but it was one of these nonsensical statements that – taken from Panday obviously that he had received this anonymous call and someone extorting a million rand from him but they couldn’t ide ntify the person.  So I took that statement and there was nothing – no-one else that I could approach to confirm so I confronted – well if I say confronted I say that in inverted commas, Vassan Soobramoney and I told him about the investigation and I obtained a warning statement from him and I presented the docket to the senior public prosecutor who then went through the docket and hedeclined to prosecute the matter.     That was the same Soobramoney Chair.     So Chair I was – about a week later I was called to another meeting this time around same scenario, go to the office...(intervention).   That’s right Chair.    So what would happen Chair the Provincial Commissioner’s secretary would phone my secretary would then tell me the PC wants to see you.      She was on the 18 t h floor so I get into the lift, go up to her office, exactly the same thinghappened, go into her office, she’s alone door closed to the boardroom she confirms with me that the inv estigation had stopped, I confirm the investigation had stopped she said come with me, we go into the boardroom, same scenario but this time...(intervention).     That’s what I’m saying Chair.      I tried to avoid her Chair.     Not that I can recall Chair.     I suspect what could have happened is, Panday and Mandoe are subjects of the investigation obviously had a network and they knew that the investigation hadn’t stopped because witnesses are now being approached from a respective bed & breakfast, so although I’m telling her the in vestigation had stopped...(intervention).   And it could not be concealed because we had to approach – Chair in the end there were over 200 affidavits obtained in that inves tigation so somehow it must have gotten to Panday and Mandoe that, look, that in spite of the assurances given by the PC this thing is still proceeding and I think itwas at their behest that she...(intervention).      That’s right Chair, she entertained them.     So I went into asecond ambush Chair, now this time around because of my engagements with a number of High Court cases, I knew  most of the counsel in, especially Durban, so I walked in and there again I encountered Advocate Choudree SC whom I knew and Advocate Stix Mdladla whom I also knew.  So we exchanged greetings and then with them was again Tasha Giyapersad the attorney and Toshan Panday. More or less the same scenario unfolded that had occurred previously but this time around by then the investigators had reported to me that Giyapersad had been interfering with the investigation.  What had happened is, statement had already been obtained and I can recall one specific one from Bongola it was at, I think, Crocodile Lodge, Crocodile Creek or something called like that...(intervention).      That’s right CrocodileCreek Guest House, now the owner of that Guest House was Edward Ngwenya, the investigators reported to me there were at least two witnesses – I recall this specific one which had been approached by Panday and in this particular instance when we did further investigations or the investigators did further investigation but I then phoned a captain in – so what had happened is Edward Ngwenya had already made an affidavit to the investigators and there was anot her guy by the name of Singh I cannot recall so they report to me that these same witnesses who had already deposed to affidavits have now been approached by Giyapersad and I know specifically with regards toNgwenya that I sent a captain there to confirm it and he phoned me back and he said to me no, he’d spoken to Ngwenya and Ngwenya said no, because of the dealings that he’d had with Gold Coast Trading, invoices were coming to and fro and he had to sign documents, they’d send him a document which he had to sign which he did but the document that he had signed, according to the investigators was an affidavit which conflicted what he had said in his affidavit to the investigators.  So I took issue with that and I said at the meeting – so I thought let me have a go at them and I said to Giyapersad, listen, you’re not at liberty to go and interview witnesses that my investigators had already interviewed and that developed into a bit of a heated argument between myself and Giyapersad and then in the end Advocat e Choudree said to Giyapersad I think the general is right just leave this and we left it at that.     No she did not.   Chair one correction at that stage I – and I cannot recall exactly at what stage I indicate – because we were running the thing on an enquiry and I think the investigators Von Loggenberg, I think it was Von Loggenberg I think they were getting fed up and they went and registered – converted the thing to – the enquiry to a docket to an actual criminal docket.     In the meantime.    Without my knowledge.     But they told me that.     And I think it was at that meeting where I said to the PC that a docket’s been opened now it’s been converted to a docket and then she said, well then she can’t interfere but I think she was merely stating the obvious.      I suspect she was surprised Chair because she said, well there’s a docket open then I cannot interfere but my take on that was she was merely stating the obvious, she knew she could not have interfered from the word go.      Chair I’m going to speculate as a detective it was – it was evident to me that there were communication between the PC, Panday and Mandoe,  now Mandoe being the middleman within the same building that we work he’s involved with the dealings of Toshan Panday, I think he’s the in -between person between Panday and the PC, so they were alive to the fact that we were – the investigation was ongoin g.  I think there were – it was either they wanted to put pressure on us to stop with the investigation and as I will explain later on in my affidavit they went to other measures as well.  Some less drastic others more drastic to try and either (indistinct) or compromise the investigation.      It was the same as atthe first meeting, that we’re investigating unlawfully, we’re making use of unlawful methods, it was repetition of the previous allegations.      Obviously Chair, after my heated discussion with Giyapersad the atmosphere was a bit thick and the meeting was called off by the PC and I left.      No Chair I didn’t but what was obvious to me after those engagements with her, the PC had a very aggressive behaviour in management meetings and General Ntanjana, General Masemolo?, General Jula whose another PC in Cape Town will bear me out here, the way she sometimes spoke to them,  I would cringe and me being the only white general there I – from that time onward I basically got away with murder.  I would sometimes – because her meetings could carry on for hours and hours and I would just stay away from the meetings, they dared not stay away from a meeting or come later at a meeting and she would have a go at them and she basically left me and – what I sense from that is, I think she was scared of what we were busy with.      I was treated muchbetter than any of the other generals.      No Chair and if I stay away from a meeting she woul dn’t even ask me where you were like she would do with the rest of the generals.   Just one last question to close up this point.  You mentioned that at this particular meeting you were accused of unlawful methods of investigating. Paragraph 28 of your affidavit alludes to a method of investigating, can you please explain what you meant by unlawful methods that you were accused of?     Mdladla, thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    That is right Chair it relates to the second report.    No he was not Chair Soobramoney was.    That is correct Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Then paragraph 6. “On 28 April 2010 the SAP made two payments into the account of Goal Coast Trading for R5 million and R536 780 respectively.   On 11  May 2010 the SAP made two payments of R1  795 million and R108 000 respectively into the account of Gold Coast Trading.  The back statements have to be  analysed in order to trace all the funds received and transfers are paid out as there appears to be a great deal of activity on the account.  At this stage the only income into the account of Gold Coast Trading CC has been received from SAPS.  All otheraccounts of Gold Coast Trading the personal accounts of Toshan Panday and his spouse have to be obtained and further analysed.”     That is how I read it Chair.   That is correct Chair.  Chair the investigators indicated to me that the total sum that appears to have been fraudulently procured/acquired was R60 million of which R45 million had already been  paid out to the company of Toshan  Panday and there was R50 million which was about to be paid out to him.     Chair.    Yes to make.    Chair maybe I can explain what happened here.    When I drafted the statement.    A lot of it comes from recollection and my memory.   And in sourcing the documents.    So I spent quite a period of time preparing these statements.     And while you are doing the statement there are a number of issues that happens simultaneously.    So when I.    Consulted with the advocate.   She suggested that we put up this timeline.    Which is our display.    So in the statement.    The sequence are notexactly.  According to the dates.    Whereas the.    This document here gives the exact sequence.    In terms of timelines.        Yes Chair.  What happened is my secretary told me that she had received a call fromaccording to her the brother of the then State President Mr  Jacob Zuma who wanted to meet with me.  So I said to her in connection with m e and she did not know in connection with what.  So I said to her where, where does – where do they want to meet me and she said know she will find out from them but it sounded like they wanted to meet me away from the office or he wanted to meet me away from the office.  So I said to my secretary look if I am going to have a meeting with anyone it is going to happen in my office.  Subsequent to that she told me that there had been another call but she then took ill and she was admitted to hospital and I think she was off six for probably about a month or so and no sooner had she returned she received another call from which she said was the brother of the then State President Mr  Jacob Zuma.  So I said to her Elaine look if they want to see me they can make an appointment and it has got come through the office to make it legitimate which she did.  I do understand that she did record that inher diary as well.  I think it was roundabout the beginning of June then.     2010 Chair.    She set down the meeting for I think it was the first week in June and then the gentleman arrived at my office.  Another friend of mine was present at the office at the time.  He just happened to drop by this friend of mine and then a gentleman came in and introduced himself as Edward  Zuma who I then realised was not the brother of the then State President.  It wasactually the son of the then State President, Edward  Zuma.  Now after we had exchanged greetings and incidentally Edward knew the friend of mine who happened to drop by in my office and they joked about a few things and so eventually we got down to business and we started talking and he started talking about the R50 mil lion which I had frozen and then he asked me if it is possible for me to unfreeze the money.  So I said to him but what is your interest in this money.  He said to me no he is a silent partner with Toshan Panday and he is not getting his dividends because I had frozen the money.  So I said to him but did you invest into the business of Toshan  Panday and he said yes.  I said how much did you invest.  He said no he had invested R900  000.  So I said to him look let me give you some advice and go and approach Mr Toshan Panday and tell him you want your R900  000 back and take your money and walk away and never look back again and we laughed and he said no that is what he was going to do and I made it clear tohim I cannot unfreeze the money because I will make my self complicit in the commission of a crime and that will be corruption in itself.  Unless it is – there is legitimate documents to release.  I cannot do that and we spoke awhile about generalities and after that he left.     He was present Chair.    Chair a couple of months later there was a traditional or cultural/traditional event at Nkandla and this very friend of mine who happened to be in the office he was invited to the cultural event.  I got a phone call – well from the event but I did not know it was from the event and it was this friend of mine and he said to me hold on someone wants to speak to you.     So.    From the same friend of mine.    Who was in my officeon the day.    When Edward Zuma visited me.    So it was a couple of weeks later it could have been a month or two later.  I received this call.  He said to me I here at Nkandla where I am attending this cultural event.  So he said hold on someone wants to speak to you.  So he handed the phone to someone else and it was Edward  Zuma and hesaid hello Booysen and we laughed and joked and I said I hop e you heeded my advice and he laughed and he said no, no I heeded your advice.  So we joked and laughed about it but it became clear afterwards he never heeded my advice and then we said goodbye to each other.    I do not know who initiated the call.    If it was my friend or whether it was him Chair.    No.    That is it Chair.    Chair what happened is at some stage this thing leaked into the media – the main.  So initially he admitted that he had been there and denied the conversation.  Then later on he denied emphatically that he had been to my office.  So I do not know which one of the two but the last time that I heard him going public he denies having been to my office.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is right.  I wrote to our Financial Department Chair and I told them not to release the money.    Because it is subject to a corruption investigation.    And I indicated that if the money should be paid out that that could be another form of corruption.    Which page?   That is correct Chair.    Chair it is a statement by Elaine Regina Latchanah who at the time was my secretary.     This is.  So this is the statement from Elaine Latchanah. “According to my recollection a person whoidentified himself as Mr  Edward Zuma requested an appointment with Major General Booysen.  Mr Zuma called several times to secure an appointment.  A date which I do not recall was agreed upon after consulting with Major General  Booysen.  Mr Edward Zuma did not inform me as to what the meeting was about.  Mr  Edward Zuma did arrive on the day agreed upon and me with Major General Booysen in General Booysen’s office.  I do not recall how long the meeting was and after themeeting Mr Zuma left.”    That is correct Chair.    Chair what happened is this friend of mine who I had mentioned earlier I request him to seek an audience with the then State President to enlighten him to what hisson was up to.  So he arranged this meeting and I travelled with him to Nkandla.  I had two meetings.  So I will describe the first meeting.  So the first meeting we arrived there at Nkandla.  I was asked to wait outside and my friend obviously being privy to what Edward was up to he went in and he spoke to the then State President Mr  Zuma.  A while later he came out and I greeted the President and I did not have any discussions with him.  So we got into my friend’s car and we left - departed for home.  So I said to my friend what happened.  He said not the President does not want to get involved.  So I left it at tha t.  Much later I again said to my friend I want to have another meeting with thePresident.  He arranged a meeting again and if I recall correctly I think it was a Sunday.  We left very early in the morning.  So we arrived at Nkandla and this time around I entered the actual house where we found the then State President Mr  Zuma.  We exchanged greetings but there were no discussions about any formal issues.  He and my friend then excused themselves.  They went into an adjacent room and I got up but I walked outside and had a look at the area there.  About 15 minutes later they came back.  They called me back into the lounge.  In the lounge we sat and the Edward  Zuma matter was not discussed at all by myself.  So we sat around and once again we spoke about the  politics of the day and a few other issues and I think we still – I think I still posed with a photograph with the, with the then State President and we left.  When we got into my friend’s car he said to me look he had spoken to the President about it – about his son’s toys and we should go and speak to Khulubuse.   That is correct.    The nephew.    That is correct.  But I have met Khulubuse before that Chair.    On social occasions. I have met him once or twice.    So I said to my friend okay but where is Khulubuse.  He says no he is in one of the places here in Nkandla.  So we drove there and it was like a big rondave l and we knocked on the door and he was busy also with a cultural story where he had to seclude himself from, from society.  He was laying on a mattress on the bed and we walked inside.  We greeted him and my friend explained to him what the President had said and then Khulubuse said look he will speak to Edward to stop his nonsense.     But the reason why suspects the President did not want to engage Edward himself isnumber one they were not on good terms at that point in time.  For two reasons the one being that Edward was drinking too much.  I assume drinking too much alcohol and the second reason being that Edward had bought a house in the Durban North area and he had not invi ted his father to the cultural opening of the residence and then he said no he will go and speak to Edward to stop his nonsense, but that is where it ended.    Chair I think it was important.  Here you have the son of a State President getting involved with – with serious corruption issues within the police and I felt it incumbent upon myself rightly or wrongly so to alert the State President what his son was busy with.    He did both – on both occasions he did Chair.    I did Chair.    That is correct Chair.    The first time?    No the first time I did not enter.  I waited outside Chair.     In the yard Chair.    He entered.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is the case Chair.    That is correct Chair.  The same friend Chair.    [Indistinct].    That is correct Chair.    That is so Chair.    That is an accurate description Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is so Chair.    That is correct Chair.  Chair it was a discussion between us.   I might have used it that he must stop his nonsense .    So he agreed to that.    That is right Chair.    That is right.    That is right Chair.    That is right.   That is correct Chair.    You see Chair what happened is in that period there was a lot of speculation in the media.  He had been to my office no he had not been.  Then he started making public statements and I wanted him to back off.  Th at was now Edward and stop his nonsense – if any- if he still had any connection with Toshan Panday.    So my understanding with Khulubuse was that he will tell Edward.     Leave this nonsense alone.  That was my understanding.     No Chair.     He did Chair.     Chair I was busy attending a seminar in Kempton Park on domestic violence when I received a call from one of the warrant officers at the Cato Manor Unit, Warrant Officer Paul Mostert.  Mostert informed me that he hadreceived a call from a person by the name of Tosha n Panday who wanted to meet up with him and he had told Toshan Panday he was a bit busy, he says an hour or so later he received another call from this person, introducing himself as Toshan Panday who said to him, no he’s close to their office, Mostert’s o ffice and that he should meet him at the garage which was just around the corner, which he then did.  He then arrived there where he met the gentleman, Toshan Panday.  Toshan Panday then said to him, look there’s been a search on our premises and the police confiscated some files and he referred to one specific file being the most important file but he knew exactly how many fileshad been confiscated and he said to him, these files are being kept in an office in Field Street and then he said to Mostert, I w ould like you to steal those files, failing which you have to set the building alight and if you do that you can name your price.  So Mostert said to me, he then told Panday no he couldn’t get involved in something like this, so I still said to – we call him Mossie, I said Mossie you should have actually engaged him and we could have gotten Section 252(a) authority, by that I mean authority from the Director of Public Prosecutions to proceed with an ostensible unlawful activity. I said to him, look why don’ t you phone him back and say to him, you thought about it, you’ve got a price and then let’s see if we cannot organise a Section 252 operation.  I then immediately phoned the DPP’s office, what I normally do is, the Captain, Captain Hennie Pelser at my o ffice who co-ordinates all the Section 252(a) operations in the province, so I phoned him and I said, look you should immediately get authority, 252 authority from theDPP, I’m flying to Durban from Johannesburg and they should get all the paperwork done.  I then also phoned Colonel Karl van der Vyfer from Crime Intelligence and I said to him, I’m flying back, we’ve got Section 252 authority, that they should rig up one of the vehicles, by that I mean, they should wire tap it so that we can record the conversations, which they did and the following day Mostert phoned Panday back to tell him, look here, he re -thought his position and he’d like to meet him – they did meet again but I think Panday must have gotten suspicious, he wouldn’t get into the vehicle an d the way he spoke to Mostert then, according to Mostert was that he was almost like– he couldn’t even remember that the previous meeting had taken place so I suspect he knew we were up to something, so nothing came of that Section 252 operation.     Mostert we call him Mossie Chair.     That’s right Chair.  A warrant officer Chair.      No, no in KZN at the Cato Manor Unit.   No.      Ja he was at the office in Cato Manor which is just outside Durban and I was here in Kempton Park.     That’s correct Chair.     (Indistinct).     No, no Chair we wanted to do a Section 252(a) operation.      Chair normally we get Section 252(a) authorisation to engage in a criminal activity,  for instance if I can give you an example, if we want to buy drugs from a drug dealer we have to apply for a Section 252(a) authorisation from the DPP – there’s a designated Advocate from the DPP’s office who will then give us that authority and the reaso n for that being, policemenwould sometimes engage in criminal activities and when they get caught they say, no I was busy with an operation.    Ja so it legitimises which ...(intervention).      That’s right Chair.      That’s indeed so Chair.   That’s indeed so Chair.       That’s right Chair.     That’s what I suspect what happened and that’s why he would not enga ge with Mostert on that particular day Chair.     No it was the following day Chair, I immediately flew back, I excused myself from theseminar and I immediately flew back to be here.      No Chair.     Chair later on in my evidence I will – Panday was always very suspicious of certain events that took place and I’ll perhaps elaborate on that bit later in my evidence.     Chair what happened is – and during the investigation we applied for Act 70 interceptions and for the benefit of the public Act 70 interceptions is where we, as investigators through Crime Intelligence apply to the designated Judge, of which there’s one, I think he’s based in Pretoria where we have to put in a motivation to legally intercept the communications  of a suspect under investigation.  At the time there were investigations – there was an application for such interceptions and Panday’s communicationswere intercepted at the time and Crime Intelligence who dealt with these interceptions, then informed me , that a certain conversation had taken place in which they intercepted a call between a colonel that had worked under my command, Colonel W S Mahlangu and I actually listened to some of the conversations and I in fact, at a later stage had confronted W S Mahlangu, the colonel with certain discussions that took place between him and Toshan Panday.  He obviously knew he couldn’t deny it because I mentioned specifics to him and he said to me no he had phoned him because they were comrades in the ANC but as far as I’m concerned that was nonsense.  So W S was one of the colonels that reported to me but he had also worked in the same building where the investigators had worked. The significance of that Chair is, the exhibits that were seized, I did not even know where they were kept.  I only established much later that they were kept at – because the colonels that were involved with this investigations someof them were ex-Scorpion members so they still had an office in Field Street, and that’s where they kept the exhibits.  So I didn’t even know that the exhibits were kept there until Mostert had told me the exhibits were there.  So we concluded from our investigations that the only person that could have told Panday where those exhibits were kept, must have been colonel W S Mahlangu. There were other communication intercepts between the two as well which related to compromising this very investigation.      Chair yes, when I became the head of the Hawks in KZN there was a project, and I cannot recall what it was called exactly, where I had to authorise his secondment to the National Prosecuting Authority where they were going to try and find people that were murdered in the Apartheid dispensation which I authorised. So he spent quite some time working with the NPA but it was common cause amongst the investigators that he had a close relationship with Advocate Moipone Noko who was the DPP or she later became the DPP she was first acting and later then became the DPP.  During – well much later in events that would follow, at the time that Advocate Mxolisi Nxasana was appointed as the NDPP I was informed that W S Mahlangu was clandestinely  trying to find dirt on Advocate Nxasana and that information of mine was confirmed in a statement which I obtained from a person by the name of Terrence Joubert from the National Prosecuting Authority.  If my memory servesme correctly, I think that state ment was attached to an affidavit deposed to by Advocate Nxasana in a High Court matter in the Western Cape, I speak under correction but in that statement Terrence Joubert states that W S Mahlangu had approached him to find dirt on Advocate Nxasana at the behest of Advocate Jiba.     I do Chair.     Chair it’s an affidavit by Terrence John Joubert and it was signed – it appears to be his signature, I don’t know him personally, it was signed in Durban on the 25 t h November 2013.    Paragraph 3, “on the 18 t h of September 2013 I was on duty and was supposed to fetch Advocate Jiba from the Ushaka International Airport, after making the arrangements I got a call from Advocate Jiba’s secretary to say that she would be fetched by colonel Mhlangu on instructions from the DPP KZN. Colonel Mhlangu is currently seconded to the NPA’s Missing Persons Unit that is headed by Debra Quinn in the Province and by Shaun Abrahams at VGM.  Their job is to assist members of the NPA to obtain information by interviewing witnesses to conclude theinvestigations.  Shortly after the meeting between Advocate Jiba an d Colonel Mahlangu he, Colonel Mahlangu came to me in my office and told me that the new guy, referring to the new NDPP, Mr Nxasana does not like Advocate Jiba and Advocate Mogwebe.  His aware that I do have a great relationship with Advocate Mogwebe and h e was playing on my emotions. I asked why he thought so and he said that he was sent by Jiba as she’s convinced that this guy is not the right person for the job and that we should try and find something on him as they did against Mr Gumede.  Mr Gumede was  the first person that we had heard about who would have been appointed the NDPP, the DPP hadthen insisted that Advocate Makosi (prosecutor) make a statement against Mr Gumede concerning the matter in which he, Mr Gumede, had ill treated her.  This instan t gave us indications as to the kind of people we were dealing with and to what lengths these people would go to get their way.  Mahlangu was instrumental in immobilising people to gang up against Mr Gumede”.     “I told him that this would be playing with fire as we all – are all small fries, when elephants fight the grass suffers was my comment to his suggestion.  Mahlangu ensured me that their efforts would not be in vain as Jiba had said if this man (Mr Nxasana) is removed then she would be appointed again.  The plan was not whether Mr Nxasana is guilty but the mere fact that they wanted to embarrass him and insist that he be removed”.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.  Chair I was approached by one of my warrant officers at the time, warrant officer – well he was a sergeant then he’s a warrant officer now, Dina Govender and he indicated to me that Colonel Navin Madhoe, the guy that we’re investigating seeked an audience with me, he wanted to see me.  So I said to him, I don’t have a problem with him, he can come and see me...(intervention).   That’s correct Chair.   So Chair the following day he again phoned me and he said to me that Colonel Madhoe would want to see me, actually he sounded a bit agitatedbecause he said that Madhoe had phoned him and accused him of not –for not wanting to facilitate a meeting between the two of us, so he said to me, can I meet Colonel Madhoe, I said no I’m fine I can meet him.  So I asked him, where would they like to meet and he said to me no at Jaipur Palace which is halfway between Durban and Durban North.      A restaurant, that’s right Chair.     So I said to him nolet’s rather meet at the Elangeni Hotel which is pretty close – walking distance from my office and we agreed.  So I immediately got in my car and it took me about two minutes to get to the Elangeni Hotel and on my arrival there they hadn’t arrived yet.  So I went upstairs, one floor up where I could see down into the reception area of the hotel.  I waited a while and I didn’t see them coming so I phoned Govender back – Dina Govender back and I said to him are you guys still coming but as I was speaking to him he said, no we’ve just arrived and I saw them coming, him and Colonel Madhoe.  Mad hoe was dressed in a leather jacket and he had a laptop bag in his hand.  So they came up to – up the staircase and exchanged...(intervention).     It was Warrant OfficerDina Govender, he also worked under my command at the time but he had nothing to do with them, I think he was friends with Madhoe.       Chair so once we had sat down there was a bench and the two of them sat across from me and we spoke for a while and then Madhoe said to me he wanted to speak to me on my own, now I don’t know...(intervention).      In private so I don’t know if it was pre-arranged between Madhoe and Govender thatGovender would then excuse himself but when he said that Govender just got up and he walked away out of earshot distance from where we were.  Madhoe then took out his laptop and opened his laptop in front of me, started setting it up and he switched it on and he turned the laptop and – now if you look at files, those little red squares there then he would prompt one of those little squares and up came a picture of a person that’s obviously dead and then he’ll press another one, another person dead but it was obvious to me that all those photographs came from police files they were people...(intervention)      Yes Chair.     That’s right Chair.    So he would go to a couple of photographs like that but then it didn’t make sense to me because all those photographs were photographs that clearly ca me from police files, from police dockets because you could see the police cordoned tape was there and the cones were there and the circles and the spray where they marked exhibits.      No he showed me the pictures.   He showed me the pictures.       Then I said to him but these are normal police photos, what’s this all about, then he said to me, no, no but he can get more pictures, I said, well get more pictures and then he said to me – he started by saying there’s a lot of stress at home, obviously referring to the ongoing investigation and then he said to me is it possible for me to assist them in the investigation.  So I said to him, how do you mean assist you in the investigation – I was taken aback because, I mean, in my position for a colonel to approach me to – and he’s a suspect and the subject of theinvestigation to approach me to assist them in the investigation was unheard of.  So I said to him and how can I help you in the investigation.  He then said to me that I’m in – myself, I’m in possession of a report by the investigators, Chair so what happens in the police...(intervention).     That’s correct Chair.    Chair if I can justexplain, normally in the police it’s a police habit, especially if you’re in a management position, when you get a document on your table we normally take the date stamp, stamp it and initial it, that’s an indication in the future when you received it, when it landed on your table.  So he said to me I’ve got this report – a progress report and he ac tually named the report that was the same one that Vassan Soobramoney had given me.   The first one Chair, so he said to me that document hasn’t got that stamp and that signature of mine on.     And he said to me – and the report itself is not dated, he said if I would take that report of mine and anti-date it to a date before the application for the Section5 subpoenas went in, that would mean that the information in that report was acquired before the Section 205 subpoenas were authorised and at the same time they had this – that was more or less at the same time that they had the High Court application for the 205’s to be set aside.     Listen...(intervention)      That’s correct Chair. Chair I cannot remember who deposed to...(intervention).      Ja he was one of them, I cannot remember who deposed to the founding affidavit and who made a supplementary I cannot recall that but be that as it may there was this application to have the 205’s set aside...(intervention).      Chair as I said I cannot recall who deposed to the founding affidavit and who made a supplementary.    So Chair so the ideawas for me to anti-date this which would have invalidated the actual 5’s and when we had the 205’s that put the investigators in a position to acquire the search warrants and the seizure of those exhibits, so it had the potential, if I’d done that, it had th e potential to compromise the entire investigation.        That’s what he did Chair.    Chair…    So two bar in my mind is R2 million.    He said hundreds meaning 100 percent.    And I handed him the document.  He then got into his car and I started walking towards the lift now and I was expecting – I never realised that they had placed detectives on the fire escape.  I thought they were going to arrest him or block him when he emerged from the building with his car.  So I.     I touched my head and then I thought I hope these people and I was actually slapping myself of frustration but I carried on walking and then as I am about to get in the lift I just heard this shout wow and then I looked to my rightand the guys had jumped from the fire esca pe.  So they took him out of the vehicle.  I carried on walking.     Got into the lift, went upstairs.  At that stage I had never done something like this before.  I was shaking a little bit.  So I composed myself and I went down again.  I did not go – by then they had taken him out of his vehicle and taken documents out of his vehicle.    And I called - I think itwas Sheriff - and there was a beehive of activity around his vehicle and I said to him there is the key to my car.  Do all the forensics that is necessary in the car.    And I went back to my office.    I think they counted the money that evening and although the arrangement was that they would give me 1.5 million the money actually counted in the – in the suitcase was 1.3, just under 1.4 million.     Rand in cash.    Yes Chair.  It was R1 372 million in cash.    Chair as I said the day before the agreement was that they would give me 1.5 million.    In exchange for the document.    And then when they are happy with the document that same afternoon they would pay me the balance of.    Half a million Rand.  The R500 000.  The problem with that scenario was once I had allowed them to get away with the document.    And they did not keep their side of the bargain.    They could have used that document and compromised the  whole investigation.  That is why I arranged that we arrest him there and then.     I could not allow him to get away with that document.    Chair that is indeed what happened.    My main concern was and I have dealt with a number of High Court cases.     Keep it as simple as possible to have gone to a second transaction.     I knew that there wasenough evidence.    To arrest him at that juncture.  I did not want to take a chance to let him get away with that document.    That is correct Chair.   Chair I could just perhaps add here.  Simultaneous to this where the [indistinct] is running.  So listening to the intercepts afterwards and we had this done scientifically where we plotted exactly where they were at diffe rent times.  So it is clear from that that Toshan  Panday and Navin Madhoe had met at the Japanese Gardens.  That is where the money was transferred from Panday to Madhoe’s vehicle.   Madhoe then proceeds to my office.    About 10 minutes into the – into the process of going to my office and I would say about a half a kilometre to a kilometre away from my office Panday phones Madhoeand he says stop the vehicle.  So Panday stops the vehicle and he says okay I have stopped he vehicle.  So he says okay go and open the boot and take a cloth and wipe the suitcase.  So that is obviously to wipe off his fingerprints if any were on.    On the suitcase.    Same day Chair.  So what happened Chair.    That is right Chair.  That is right.    That is right.    That is right Chair.    Well subsequent when we listen to the intersects.    He says to Madhoe stop the vehicle.    Wipe the suitcase.   To wipe any possible fingerprints there.    Of his that could be on the vehicle.    On the – on the suitcase.    I am fine Chair.    Chair subsequent to the engagement we listened to some of the telephone conversations intercepted conversations of Panday.  So obviously he had now sent Madhoe with just under R1.4 million to my office.     And he is now waiting for Madhoe to return with this document that is going to assist them.     And he does not come back.  So he makes a number of frantic calls.  Some to the Provincial Commissioner who does not take his call and we suspect she might have  been busy in Pretoria.  He phones a number of senior police officers [intervenes].    He is getting very worried.  You can hear he is frantic.  He cannot – he does not know where Madhoe is.    The money or the report.  And then one particular conversation I think it was late in the evening Chair wasbetween him and a person by the name of Deebo Mzobe.    Deebo Mzobe from my understanding is a nephew of the - or a cousin – I am not too sure – of the then State President Mr  Jacob Zuma.  And there is a conversation between Panday and Deebo where Deebo  Mzobe – where Panday says that I am acting – Booysen now – I am acting like the mafia and.    But I am now standing in the way of everything – words to that effect.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is right Chair.  That is the conversation I am referring to Chair.     Chair male one in this conversation will be Toshan  Panday and male two will be Deebo Mzobe.    I did Chair.    I did Chair.  Chair with your permission I would like to read this because this is the nub.     Of where I think my problem started.    If the Chair would allow me to read it.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Male one - that is now Toshan Panday. “Howzat.     “Male one   It is being televised.  “That whatever White bastard and I told my sister do not trust this White bastard but s he said no send itthrough because he is going to play ball.  He will do this.  He will do that and whatever.  [Speaking simultaneously the two of them] and that is what he    Male one will be Toshan Panday and male two will be Deebo  Mzobe.    Chair it emerged from the investigations that the investigators were doing that Toshan  Panday and Deebo Mzobe are two – are both registered partners to different close corporations.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair the inescapable conclusion that I come to is that they were referring to the PC.     That is correct Chair.    Oh Chair the mere fact.    Because I am - sorry Chair for interrupting you.    Chair was indeed in Pretoria.    With a meeting with crime stats.    And he refers to our lady being in Pretoria with the crime stats.     That could only have been Navin Madhoe Chair.  Chair myinterpretation of that is that I need to be clipped.     I do not know having been a member of the Hawks whether they want to clip my wings, but they wanted to clip me somehow.    Chair at that juncture it could have meant anything, but subsequently it was clear to me wha t that clipping meant.    I was not sure.    I did Chair.    Chair subsequent to that events unfolded that led to myself being targeted.     Ostracised.    Eventually arrested.    Definitely Chair.    That is indeed so Chair.  I think about a week or two later after further evidence h ad been gathered by the investigators they managed to apply for a warrant of arrest for Toshan Panday.  At the time he happened to be out of the country.  He was flagged at movement control and on his return from abroad – if I say abroad I think he had gon e to the DRC – and on his return at O R Tambo Airport he was arrested at the airport and brought to Durban.    That is correct Chair. Chair I cannot remember.  I suspect he was still in custody.    I think it was forcorruption Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMB ER:  Is it also correct that in paragraph 40 of your main affidavit the date of 8 August 2011 ought to have been 8 September 2011?

ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This particular slide talks to – if I could use the term cluster, various clusters.  Such being Police, Justice, Intelligence, Finance, Governance, Parliament and thePresidency.  To what extent are these different clusters dependent upon each other in the chain of the Criminal Justice System?     Thank you.  It was your evidence that you were appointed as the Prov incial Head of the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal and that you held at the time the rank of Major General and that you were also the Deputy Provincial Commissioner in KZN at the time.  That is correct?     Just talking to your particular slide it was prior to this appointment or rather let me ask the question.  What position did you hold before that particular appointment?    Is it correct that you were also ceased with other departments which were support functions to the core units?   Can you please indicate what those support functions were which is actually referenced in paragraph 11 of your affidavit?    Thank you.  Looking at the four blocks in that particular diagram on your sli de two under the cluster of Police - for those of us like me who may not fully understand can I ask that you just explain the relationship in simple terms between Crime Intelligence, SAPS, the Hawks and IPID please?     Thank you.  So from what position do you give evidence today?  Is it one of a civilian or is one based on your professional experience in the service?     Thank you.    At paragraph 12 of your affidavit you make a particular assertion in relation to the capture of individuals. Can you please explain your?     Please.    Major General Booysen how would you explain your record of work during your service since you started in 1976?    Thank you Chair.  You said that there was a change that came about in your record.  What was the trigger in your view for the change in the unblemished record that you had during your service?    In that instance can I ask for slide three to please be displayed?  For your ease of reference you will find that particular slide in EXHIBIT ZD.    Chair you would find it in EXHIBIT ZD.    And it is page 3 of that bundle.    Thank you.  This diagram represents a timeline of your evidence in relation to the Panday investigation or rather the investigation into the businessman, Mr  Toshan Panday.  Isthat correct?    Is it also correct that this diagram in fact consolidates in time order which may not be exactly reflected in time sequence in your affidavit, but that the way in which it is described in the timeline is in fact correct?     So if would then start in the first block and you could use then this as your guide to giving the evidence in relation to this investigation.  Plea se explain to the Chair what happened on 28 April 2010 and in your own words amplify your evidence?    Before, before you continue if I could just interject there for a second.  Can you just give clarity to exactlywhat this investigation concerned please?   What was the nature of the investigation?    Thank you.  General what did you do once you considered the information that was given to you by Brigadier Kemp on 3 May 2010?    Thank you and who was allocated the investigation?    Thank you and who registered the inquiry?    Thank you so much.  What then happened during early May  2010 as you were travelling home?    Did the Police Commissioner during that call ask you any details about the magnitude of the investigation, the role players involved or any other factual detail in relation to the investigation?    Please then clarify what is the normal procedures and protocols to stop an investigation?      So you received this call from PoliceCommissioner Ngobeni, what then happens the next day?      Based on the evidence that you’ve given that the process of stopping the investigation was improper why did you proceed to inform Late gan to return the file and stop the investigation?    On the 8 t h of May, while you were at home, you received another teleph one call.  Can you please share with this Commission what transpired and who called you on that particular day?     Just to clarify you mentioned that the first call happened during early May 2010 and the second call then happened on the 8 t h of May 2010.     Thank you.     General Booysen what was theinvolvement of Lt General Anwar Dramat, if there was any involvement of him at all, following the last call that you received from the Provincial Commissioner?      Okay, so after the last call that you received from the Provincial Commissioner Ngobeni on the 8 t h of May 10 did you raise this issue with any of your superiors?      Okay, when did you raise this issue with any of your superiors?      Thank you.  Just one clarity on the date as you mentioned earlier, if you turn to page 10, paragraph 30 of your affidavit, is it correct that the meeting that you had with Lt Gen eral Anwar Dramat happened during late May of 2010?      As it was corrected in your supplementary affidavit.  Chair if I may, I understand it’s time for abreak?    Thank you.  If I can then ask you to quickly turn to Annexure JWB1 which is in your – in file ZA and that is at page 7 [intervenes].    72.    Is it correct that this was in fact a follow up report that was done pursuant to the first report that was jus t referred to now?    Or earlier, sorry.    Correct.    If I could perhaps assist.    Due to the change of date which was rectified through a supplementary affidavit the date being changed from May 2011 to 2010.    It shifted in sequence.    But it was during late May  2010 as the General had given evidence that he met with Dramat in Pretoria.     Just as an update then in terms of what this progress report stated which also is necessary for the evidence to follow.  Can I ask you to turn to page 75 of that particular bundle?    As it pleases Chair.  My copy is similar.  I would certainly request the investigators to assist.    In obtaining a clear report if possible.    If I can then ask you at paragraph 13 to just read the first sentence of th at into the record please?     I apologise.    Apologies Chair.    General Booysen if I can ask you to read the first sentence of paragraph 13 at page 75 into the record please?    And who would this target be as referred to in the report?    If I could then ask you to read from the second sentence in paragraph 14 please to the end of that paragraph?    And then paragraphs 15 and 16.    And that team last sentence refers to the engagement that you had then with the Provincial Commissioner to which you have already given evidence at which you provided her and Ntanjana with a copy of the report.  Is that co rrect?    You – the evidence that you gave isthat you gave a copy of this report to two people such being one the Provincial Commissioner a nd two being Ntanjana.  Okay.    Yes Chair.    Let me rather retract the question.     If I may.  If I could then just ask you to read paragraph 16 and paragraph 18 int o the record pleases?    Of the same report.    Yes please.    Not that paragraph the next one which is paragraph 18 please.    And it is correct then that this report has been compiled by Colonel  V Soobramoney dated 4 June 2010?    What is apparent from this report according to the evidence that you have given relative to the report isthat unhindered investigation was necessary.  Is that correct/     Okay.    Yes Chair.  The page number is page7 of his main affidavit.    And it is paragraph 23.    23.    Please proceed.    As it pleases Chair.    As it please Chair.    In fact he is about to address some of the queries that Chair has now raised.     And to that end it was during late June 2010 that you were once again summonsed to the Police Commissioner ’s office.  Is that correct?    You can turn to page 8 paragraph 24.     Please explain to the Chair what had then transpired at this particular meeting and who was present.     Paragraph 24.    If I can.    Sorry, sorry to interrupt you, but just for the record can I ask you to spell Tasha  Giyapersad please?    Thank you.     On your suspicion as your evidence entails that something was amiss, can I ask you to turn to page 17 of your affidavit – main affidavit in Bundle ZA at paragraph 55.      55 so it’s page 17 at paragraph 55, reference there is made to an independent forensic report can you please inform the Chair about this in the context of the evidence that you’ve given so far?    And according to the report what was the amount of money that was spent on the birthday party for the husband of the Provincial Commissioner at the time?      Thank you.     And just to clarify, that birthday party happened, approximately when?      So if I can just quickly take you back to the meeting that you had in late – if we can go back now to paragraph 24 on page 8 of your affidavit.      If I could then just quickly take you back to  page 8 of your affidavit which then details – at which you then address the evidence that you had already given in relation to the meeting that you had late June 2010, can I just ask what exactly was the Police Commissioner’s attitude at that meeting towards continuance of the investigation?     The one at paragraph 24 at which you have already given evidence where Mr Panday, Mrs TashaGiyapersad and Advocate Mkisi was present.     Yes Chair that is indeed.     My question is was – did the Police Commissioner indicate her attitude at all to continuance of the investigation?     Thank you Chair, thank you for clarifying that point and it was then at that meeting that you were – you mentioned that Soobramoney was – or rather allegations were made against him in relation to extortion from Mr Toshan Panday, that’s correct?  And what was the Police Commissioner ’s direction to you in relation to that allegation against Mr Soobremoney?     And did you?     And this is the same Colonel Soobramoney who had authored the r eports that you have submitted to this Commission...(intervention)      Thank you, about one week later you were summoned to another meeting...(intervention).      You mention it at paragraph 29 if I can direct you there.  They were accusing the investigators Chair, of accessing their bank documents and other documents that could possibly incriminate them unlawfully.  Now Chair what happens is in practice it does happen from time to time where investigators would, through their contacts in th e banks, acquire information and then ex post facto obtain 205’s.  When they accused my investigators initially of doing that I engaged with them, I called them to my office and I said to them, chaps I don’t want any of this and they assured me 100% that every single cell phone record, bank statement that they had acquired were lawfully done by means of Section 205 subpoenas from the Criminal Procedure Act.  They were saying that my detectives did not have 205’s and hence they were –because the reports, an d it will become clear later why they would say that because the information in the reports contained information that could only have been acquired from the banks by means, either from a 5 or unlawfully but they were saying we acquired – or my investigators acquired it unlawfully. I see that in your statement at paragraph 27 one of the advocates that you say were present at the meeting that you talked about just now is written as Advocate Stix Madlala, I think it’s Mdladla.      Thank you for the correction Chair.      Chair I note the time, and I have been informed that it may be prudent ...(intervention)      Thank you Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS  INQUIRY RESUMES     Hm.    Chair the number that he sought to clarify at paragraph.    Appears to be 1 303 460.    And the number at paragraph 5 if I am reading correctly is 1  894.    200.    Chair I am not sure if it is, if it was stated correctly but just to err on the side of caution the num ber at paragraph 7, the first number which is on 11  May SAP made two payments R1 795 million and R108 000 respectively into the account of Gold Coast Trading.    Thank you.    Yes Chair.    The first one Chair.    Which is one million.    Yes.    Thank you Chair    I am [intervenes].    I understand that reference was made to 1 795 million.    Which is.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.    If I can then take you to page 15 paragraph 48.    Yes Chair.    No problem Chair.   The approach of jumping around Chair.    Was on the direction of.    Farida, but having said that C hair.    As it pleases.  Chair if I may the timeline that was prepared which has been EXHIBIT DZ.     In fact consolidates all of the  events in sequential order.    Relevant to the affidavit that has been given and the supplementary affidavits that have been given.     Yes Chair.    So if I could point you in the direction with your leave to the third block on the far right hand side.  Ittalks to during the investigation.     No problem.    No problem Chair.    Yes Chair.      So to just ensure my block numbering is exactly the same it would be six blocks on top.  Is that correct Chair?    Thank you.    In.    Would that be in reverse?     Thank you Chair.    3-0?    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you so much Chair.  So now you are on block 19.    In relation to the R50 million.    Correct Chair.    Correct.  In relation to the R50 million payment that had not been made at that time.  Do you have any comments in relation to the payment of those monies?     Has there ever been any issues since that visit by Mr Edward Zuma about him attending your office on thatparticular day?        Has Mr Edward Zuma ever denied having visited you on that day?     Can I ask you to turn to page 88 of your main affidavit?    If I can take you to page 88 if you are there?    Page 88 of your main affidavit.  It is Annexure JWB4.  Is it correct that this is an affidavit that the Commission’s investigators obtained?     Please identify the document.    And if you could read from this    I will appreciate that.    Now this is in fact an affidavit that was deposed to on 23 November 2018.  Is that correct?     Just for the record Elaine is spelt E -L-A-I-N-E.  The second name which is Regina is spelt R -E-G-I-N-A and the surname which is spelt L-A-T-C-H-A-N-A-H.  There was – okay.  There is one particular event which is not included in this particular timeline and to that extent I would like to take you to  EXHIBIT ZC and in particular page 3 of this bundle.Paragraphs 7 todocuments/events that took place after Mr  Edward Zuma attended your office.  Can you please inform the Chair of such events?         What informed your insistence to seek an audience with former President Jacob Zuma?       Did anything result from your visits to Nkandla?     If you can then move on did Mr Toshan Panday do anything to try to derail the continuing investigation, and we are now on block 20?      Yes thank you so much Chair apologies for that.       Please provide details in relation to it...(intervention).     So it’s your evidence that Mr Toshan Panday must have suspected something, is that correct?   General Booysen did ...(intervention).     General Booysen did you establish any reason for how Mr Toshan Panday may have suspected something?      Did colonel Mahlangu have any relationship with Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba?     In that regard could I take you then to page 78 of your affidavit please – main affidavit. Do you recognise this document?     Please identify the document?     For the benefit of the record, can I ask you to read paragraph 3 and 5 into the record please?      And the last paragraph being paragraph 5 please.     Thank you and just for the avoidance of doubt, this is the affidavit of Terrence John Joubert?      Thank you, moving on to block 21 of our timeline and if I may perhaps start off, my understanding is that Section 252(a) processes are referred to a “sting operations” is that correct?     Okay was there – or rather what happened on the 24 t h of August 2011?   And if I can interrupt you, Colonel Madhoe is the person who was being investigated in the Toshan Panday investigation is that correct?      Please proceed.     Is that a restaurant?     Thank you.    On that score can I just direct you toparagraph 40 of your affidavit which informs of the actual amount you may be referring to.    and just one point for clarity.  You mentioned now that there was one 1.5 million that out to have been paid but your earlier evidence was two bar which you understood to be 2 million.  Can you please clarify?     Thank you.    Chair if I may.  Two points, my attention is being drawn to the time.     Which is now quarter past four.    Chair if I may.    The next segment of his evidence would likely take longer than 15 minutes.     But if you – if you are happy for us to proceed on that basis that is fine.   As it pleases Chair.  I have also been handed a better copy of.    [Indistinct].    Correct Chair.    Which is JWB1.   With your leave if I may hand it up.  Thank you.    Thank you.  We are now block 24 of the timeline.  On the very day that Colonel  Madhoe was arrested on 8 September 2011 a certain telephonic exchange took place.     Correct Chair.  That was in fact corrected through one of his supplementary affidavits.     Yes Chair.  It is September.   And that was actually correc ted in paragraph 5.1 of his first supplementary affidavit.     EXHIBIT ZC.    I had mentioned that on the very day that Colonel Madhoe was arrested a certain telephonic discussion took place to which you were made aware of.  Can you please inform the Chair about such exchange?    If I could perhaps just take you then in line with the conversation that you now speak of to page 82 of yourmain affidavit.    82.    Z.    A.    Apologies Chair.    Thank you.    Yes.  On 80.    On page 82 is a transcriber’s certificate which appears to be dated 8  September 2011 and it has been transcribed by Shweta Typing and Transcription Services.  Is that correct?    Apologies.  It in fact appears to relate to.    The transcription of an event that took place on 8 September 2011.   And is it correct that that is in fact the same date on which Colonel  Madhoe was arrested?    If I can then ask you to turn to page 83 which runs until page 86.  Is this in fact th e conversation that you were referring to?    Okay.   Can I ask you to then identify - or rather the document talks to male one and male two – can I ask you to please identify who male one is and who male two is?     In that instance I am going to ask you to read this transcript into the record, but in doing so to identify what male one says relative to what male two says.     Yes Chair.    Okay.    Thank you.  Just to reiterate, pleaseidentify again for the record who male one is.     Do you know what the relationship is between Toshan Panday and Mr Deebo Mzobe?    Reference in this discussion is madeto a person who appears to be a woman.     In your understanding who was that woman that they were referri ng to?    The conversation also refers to “the guy who was arrested”.  Who was the guy they refer to?     And then mention was also made in    Were any subsequent arrests made after Colonel Madhoe was arrested?    Do?    Do you recall the charge against Mr Toshan Panday for which he was arrested?     Okay.    As it pleases. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Thank you Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS    INQUIRY RESUMES  
ADVOCATE KAVITHA BHEEMCHUND:   Good morning Chairperson.    Instructed by the offices of thestate attorney Kwazulu Natal.    Major General Ngembe is one of the implicated persons who was served with the Rule 3.3 Notice.     We reserve our rights to apply to cross-examine Mr Booysen depending on the evidence presented.      Thank you Chairperson. 
BHEEMCHUND:My name is Kavitha Bheemchund from the Durban Bar with dual membership at the Johannesburg Bar.  I represent Major General Nomf azi Ngembe. 
ADVOCATE JOHAN EKSTEEN :  Morning Chair.    My name is Johan Eksteen.    Of the firm BDK Attorneys.    We are here to represent Major General Jan Mabula.    He has also received a Section 3.3 Notice.    And we also reserve the right for cross-examination or [indistinct].    Thank you Chair. 
AJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:So after the introductions I was basically peppered with questions from Panday and Giyapersad.  They accused the investigators of not having a mandate and they are investigating unlawfully and they were almost on a fishing expedition to try and I had to negotiate my way through this meeting  trying to avoid answering certain questions because I was not going to give feedback. 
CHAIERPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBR:  If I can then take you to paragraph 47 which is on page 14 of your statement.  Apologies, your affidavit.  During the investigation were any monies paid to Mr  Toshan Panday? 
ADV VERUSHCHKA SEPTEMBER :   At paragraph 20 of our timeline my question to you is, did Mr Toshan Panday do anything to try to derail the continuing investigation against him?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOY SEN:  It was information pertaining to the bank statements.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSE L BOOYSEN:  So I said to him I do not know how far this investigation had gone but what I will do I will speak to the investigator officer.  And that was the agreement and then we left.    Chair on the day before we did the actual operation which I will refer to as the sting operation or two days before that I cannot remember I met him at the funeral.  Well he came to the funeral.  And after the funeral he came up to me and he said to me I must not forget to write and he gave me the date.
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  Ja that is one point Chair and another point is in terms of the doctrine of the fruit of the poisonous tree.  Once a 205’s failed the search warrants would have failed and the seizure of those exhibits would have been – we would have had to return thos e exhibits.    I played along Chair.
now you know.  Male two:  [Indistinct].  Male one
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Chair we did discuss it during the adjournment.    The choices are 09   Or 10 for two hours.    As you please Chair.
