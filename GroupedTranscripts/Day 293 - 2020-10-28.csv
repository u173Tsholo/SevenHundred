CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Kennedy, good morning everybody.  Thank you.  You may be seated Mr Mlambo.  Yes are you ready?    Yes do you not need assistance Mr Mlambo there?  I think he needs assistance.  You trying to get used to how to handle it.  Okay, okay.  Okay alright.  The oath you took yesterday will continue to apply today okay?  Alright.  Thank you.    I am sorry.  I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  Do you happen to know by any chance what it is that Mr Saloojee says was the solution that he thought was the solution to your concerns?  Do you know what it is?    Or you do not know?    Yes, no but my question is whether when he says he engaged I think with certain people within Denel and he thought a solution had been found to your concerns do you know what he is talking about or do you not know but you – you speculate?    You actually do not know.    Yes.    Okay alright.  Are you surprised that any solution to concerns raised by you would have been found without involving you?    Yes.    Hm.  Is there nobody whoever came to you within Denel or DLS to say – apart from what Mr Burger wrote to you – is there anybody who came and said and we actually have found a solution and this is the solution to your concerns?    No-one ever did that.  Okay alright. Mr Kennedy.    To which problem?    Okay.    I am sorry what page is it?    Oh okay.    What is the page number?    Okay thank you.    Mr Kennedy this cannot be the document that Ms Malahlela said was amended had come from her but was amended without her knowledge he?    That one must be another one?    Okay alright.    Yes.     That is Mr Burger?     H’m.     Eight, zero ...[intervenes]      I am sorry.  Which part of those minutes reveals Mr Burger’s support for LMT?     Is it 809?     Ja?  Is what is in the...  The chairman     Yes.     Okay.  H’m.  Okay.  Mr Burger(sic).     They were trying to answering(?) you about entities.     ...and not individuals.     H’m.     And it is interesting that he obviously thought it was important to mention a particular individual under Elgasolve, Mr Salim Essa.  But for the rest, he does not disclose any individuals.  He just gives entities, legal entities only.     Because if it was... if he had accepted that it was important to give the identity of the individuals in regard to Elgasolve, why did he not think it was equally important to give the identity of individuals in regard to the other entities?       H’m.       Where are you now?     Oh.     You did not get a response for this one?     Yes.     H’m.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.  Yes.  Ja, when I saw this ...[intervenes]      I suspected that he would not have got an answer for it.  I am just saying, when I read this email of Mr Mlambo to Mr Aurora, somehow something told me that he was unlikely to have gotten an answer.  [laughing]       You may proceed.     Okay.     I see the time seems to be for the tea break, Mr Kennedy.     Yes but if there is one question you want to finalise before?     Ja, okay.     Yes.     Ja.     And you know his handwriting?     Yes.     Do you – what was your understanding of what he was approving because based on where he put – he wrote approved and put his signature, one does not know on the face of it whether he was approving your comment that DVS and LMT must submit proof that they cannot meet the requirements prior to the contracts being awarded to VR Laser or whether he was furnishing his approval of what Ms Malahlela wanted in her memo.  What was your understanding of what he was approving?     Okay, so …[intervenes]     Yes.  Okay, alight.     Yes.  Okay, alright.  So he was overriding what you had just said in that note?     Ja, okay.  Alright, we are going to take the tea break.     On a light note, I just want to declare that I did not communicate with Mr Kennedy or Mr Mlambo or Registrar Mr Mfeka about the colour of the ties we must wear this morning.  I did not talk to anybody, I do not know about the three of you but I did not talk to anybody.     We adjourn.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     I found that there is another culprit, one  of my protectors is wearing a similar tie.     Okay, thank you, let us continue.     Just before that, Mr Kennedy, neither you, Mr Mlambo nor Mr Ntshepe indicated the date when you respectively signed on this page.  Do you have a recollection of whether you go this memo on the same date which is 29 October 2015 and you made your note then or that you got it maybe a day or two after and you made this note there?     You cannot recall.  You cannot recall also how soon after receiving it you made the note?     Yes.  Okay, alright.     Well, it is the second time that it looks like somebody who is going to testify here who relied on this provision does not seem on the fact of it to understand what impractical means.  I did have another witness here in relation to the Free State evidence, the then CFO of the Department of Agriculture said she relied on this provision for supporting that a certain job should not be sent out to open tender but I asked her what her understanding of impractical is and it seems here – I mean, when you look at Mr Burger’s reasons, there seems to be nothing that shows that it was impractical to invite bids because that is what this provision says, you know, if it must be impractical to invite other bids before you can invoke it.  So that is the point I think you make in your last reason but Mr Burger will come here, maybe he will persuade me that actually it was impractical.     Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.     In other words, you cannot rely on how good a particular service provider is to justify invoking this regulation, you cannot say they are so good, they are international, they are this, they provide, you know, excellent service.  That is not a reason to invoke this …[intervenes]     Yes, because …[intervenes]     Ja because when you look at the reasons that Mr Burger gives, he says one, it is unparalleled expertise on fabrication of complex engineering systems.  That is just about how good it is in his view.  Then he says it is a key supplier and strategic partner of DLS, that says nothing about impracticality.  He says it offers the best value.  That says nothing about the impracticality.  And then he goes on.  But, as I read this it just seems to me that he may have I misunderstood what impracticality means in that provision but he will come and he will explain and maybe he will give us a certain perspective.  Yes, Mr Kennedy.     Ja, I see at 839 there is something written Mr Ntshepe overruling Mr Mlambo’s rejection.  I guess that is what he said, 840, I assume.     No, I said 839.     Ja, it says Mr Ntshepe overruling Mr Mlambo’s rejection.     Then 840 I think must be the annexure where – okay, no, no, I am sorry, 840 is something else but there is a note at 839.     Oh, yes, yes.     Yes.  Well, I am looking at 841 where Mr Ntshepe wrote “Approved” and then put his signature.     So that must be overruling that is being referred to.     Ja, okay.     722?     Okay.     Do you remember whether Mr Ntshepe was Acting Group CEO or Group CEO at the time?     Of November 2015.     On suspension. MR     September 2015.     Ja.  Okay, so he was acting.     Yes and I think Mr Saloojee left sometime in 2016 or early 2017, I cannot remember.  Ja, okay.     So it was quite a serious financial detriment.     Prejudice to the entity.     Okay.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     No, that is fine and if that is found later he could possibly just do a supplementary affidavit and confirm what he knows about it.     Okay.     Intellectual property.         Yes, I just want for the record to confirm that when you say IP you refer to intellectual property.        Okay.      So you faced disciplinary action in regard to this one incident what about other incidents in which other people seems to have been involved which appear to have been problematic?      Oh.        So are you saying that you were told that Bowman’s had conducted an investigation and had concluded that the letter was fake but you never actually saw the report from Bowman’s.           But you say you yourself had communicated with the company and sort confirmation that the letter was authentic and they had provided that confirmation.        Yes, and that was before you were dismissed or was it after you were dismissed.       Oh you were never dismissed.      Oh you resigned.      Yes.        Okay, Mr Kennedy.          No that is fine.       Yes.       Mr Kennedy.                         Yes, okay. Thank you very much Mr Mlambo for coming to assist the Commission we appreciate it very much and if we need you we will ask you again and I have no doubt you will come back if asked.  Thank you very much.         Yes.      Thank you, you are excused.      Mr Kennedy.      Yes.     Yes.      Okay.      Okay, alright.      Ja, okay they can bring him up to the witness chair. Maybe I should take a five minute’s adjournment while you sort out everything.      Yes, we will adjourn.   INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Yes Mr Kennedy.    Yes.    Before he is sworn in Mr Nkosi where is your jacket?  Where is your jacket?    Hm.    You did not wear a jacket?  You should wear a jacket when you come to a forum like this.  I think somebody is going to give you a jacket.  Thank you Mr Nkosi and to those who have assisted you.  Now you may take the oath or affirmation.      Thank you; you may be seated Mr Nkosi.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes thank you.    Please raise your voice Mr Nkosi.    The statement/affidavit of Mr Phumlane Nkosi starting at page 4 of this bundle is admitted as Exhibit W13.    Yes okay.    Ja.    Ja no that is fine.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, yes, ja.      Yes.    We are at one o’clock Mr Kennedy.    Shall we take the lunch adjournment until two?    Okay we will take the lunch adjournment we will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.     Oh, somebody must just organise water for him.     I am sorry.  He informed you of...?     Do not be too far from the mic but do not be too close either.     Okay.  [laughing]       Come closer to the mic again.       You are too far.  So you say it would affect people sitting at the back.     What about people sitting in the front?  They would not be affected?     What I am trying to find out.  You know, when you talk about the people at the back, one supposes that at the back, there could be people at the front.     Yes.     Yes.       But does it mean that they would be safe?     Ja, chances of being injured are... there are less chances of them being injured compared to those who sit at the back.     Yes.     H’m.  If it fails, one ...[intervenes]      ...just like four people at the back.  Do you then have to take it back and they look at everything including people who would sit in the vehicle and in the front?     So in other words, you do not have to do all because ...[intervenes]      ...one is enough.     Okay.     Okay.     Ja.     Ja.     But wait.  In terms of which one you test whether it is people at the back or in the front, is it like a sample?  You just take anyone ...[intervenes]      The manufacturers never know whether you test people in the front or people in the middle.  You just take anyone.  And if it fails, that is it.   Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr Kennedy.     Okay.     [No audible reply]      I am sorry.      Does it say that they tried to criticise the test?     Okay.     Now you say the inadequacies of the test.     Now that might mean the test was flawed not the vehicles.     Was it the test that had flaws or the test was fine by the vehicles were not manufactured according to the required standard.  That is why they failed the test.     Eight point four...?     Yes.     Oh, okay.     Okay, okay.     Okay.     Okay.  Now I understand.  Thank you.     Is the position that Armscor issued the certificates on the strength of the test done by the CSIR or did they also do the test or supervised the test and ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Not to oversight?     H’m.     H’m, h’m.  They did not do this, that here?     Okay.     Armscor did not do it?     Oh.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     It sounds like a cut and paste job.       Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.       Did you say 138?     H’m.     Would Armscor...  Would that be a signature from somebody from Armscor there, even though on the face of it, it appears to be CSIR document?     Yes.     Ja, okay.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     But the absence of a signature from somebody from Armscor ...[intervenes]      ...it reflects  different - it is not what it should be.     It does not carry the same status.  It is not valid.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     So the absence of Armscor would weaken the weight of this document.     In this instance.     Ja, ja, okay.     Ja, okay.     But what do you say about that explanation or reasoning?     Not have agreed to that.     But he seems to have been told and what he seems to have agreed to does it not amount to not doing your job?     Well, you cannot say you cannot say it because you are his successor, you know – would it not be your job if you are faced with the same situation?  Would you not be derelict in your duty if you did what he seems to have done.     Ja.     Ja, but on the fact of it…     It would be a dereliction of duty as far as you are concerned and it is not something that you would do.     Ja, yes.     Okay.     Mr Beetge.     Oh, okay.     But the norm is that when those – when such certificates are issued generally, do they – are they valid for certain specified periods or are they valid forever?     Forever.     Ja because it relates to a particular time.     Okay.     Are we on the same page?     Oh, I think we are on 302.     Yes, ja.  Ja.     Just come closer to the mic and raise your voice a bit?  Yes, okay, just start afresh, explain?     13.4 is at page 20.     You are lowering your voice.     Just go closer to the mic and try and raise it.     The more you lean back the more I do not hear you.     Ja.     Was that change of attitude maybe because of your role that you were now playing in this whole thing which obviously you did not play in 2005 because you were not there?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, your voice goes down, Mr Nkosi.  So maybe you should keep much closer to the mic that would be normal.     Ja because I think you easily slow down and then you become, your voice becomes …[intervenes]     The fixing of a problem that would have occurred or problems that had occurred in 2005, would that be a basis to suspect that maybe there was an attempt to conceal something or that would be going too far?     You are not sure.     Okay, but certainly it was an attempt to fix the problem whether correctly or not correctly might be another issue.     Okay, alright.     Thank you, Mr Nkosi, for coming to assist the Commission, if we need you to come back and assist us you will be asked but thank you very much, you are now excused.     Yes.     Ja, okay, let me take a five minutes adjournment while everything is being prepared.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Are you ready Mr Kennedy?     Yes.     Okay which bundle?     Okay please administer the oath or affirmation.     You may be seated.  Oh Mr Kennedy this is the witness who made a request?     And he understands?     Okay, alright, we appreciate if you understand Mr Mlipha.     Okay, alright.     The statement/affidavit of Mr Xolani Mlipha starting at page 4 is admitted as Exhibit W12.     You may proceed.     Yes.     At what page Mr Kennedy?     12, okay.     I think Mr Kennedy wanted to what P stands for and what L and A stand for, isn’t it Mr Kennedy?     And the A?     Oh, okay.    But are you saying it introduced or are you saying the risk was always there but it increased the risk?    It increased the risk.    Yes.    Okay.    And this – and in this case they – should they have been met by 2012?    Yes.    Yes.    Must – must mean that there is something that – is there something that went terribly wrong that by  they have not been met?    Yes.    Serious challenges.    Yes.    Okay.      Now as we speak in 2020 bearing in mind that the requirement should have been met in 2012 is there – what is the projection of when the requirements will be met if you are able to say?  Or is there no light at the end of the tunnel?    So if you look at Armscor’s view of what requirements have been complied with and what requirements still have to be complied with what is the projection of when all the requirements that Armscor regards as important to be complied with are likely to be complied with?    That – that gives me the impression that it is not known when all the requirements that Armscor regards as important will be met?    That is from your point of view?    I can see you are very careful. But I just want to have an idea this is something that should have happened by 2012    I mean in a different work stream or – of the commission I was dealing with certain government issues relating to communications and certain set boxes were supposed to be you know installed in houses or something supposed to have been done already in 2008 or thereabout and by last year that program was nowhere near.   So now I am coming across another one where some things – you know all the requirements should have met in 12 and we are in 2020.    So I am wondering whether it is just one of those where there is just no light at the end of the tunnel as to where it will end.    You do not want your superiors to…    Ja.    Ja okay.  No that is alright.  Mr Kennedy.    Yes, no I have seen there are quite a lot.    Yes Mr Kennedy.     Page 20.       Does that mean they were deviations which were supposed to be exceptions were, ended up being regarded as the norms?     Yes, yes.     Because they are supposed to be exceptions.     Not all the time.     Yes.     Okay, okay.     Okay.     You must help me now in case I have missed this somewhere.  Industrialisation would mean what in a lay person’s language in this context?     H’m.     Oh, okay.     So if we go back to the example you gave earlier on of the bottle... this water bottle.     That is something you do after you have go ahead that the bottle needs all the requirements for the purpose for which it is made?     Now you can go and make more bottles because you have to make them in accordance with these requirements or specifications.     Okay alright.  Okay continue. You are dealing with industrialisation and I interrupted you because I just wanted to make sure I understood what it means in paragraph 21.1.       You might need to remind you of Mr Kennedy of the question he was dealing with because I interrupted him now.       [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Mr Kennedy will ask you a few things.  The details are important.  Ja, continue.     H’m.     These vehicles cannot be used if there is that risk.     Yes.     What do you do with them?  What is the purpose of having them?       H’m.     But what would have been the... would there have been a useful purpose for these vehicles to be manufactured if they would not meet that requirement?  I mean, how do you get into a contract for the manufacturing of those vehicles without including that requirement?   Or is the position that it is so obvious that even if you do not include it, the manufacturer should never think that they should build or manufacture vehicles like this without that requirement because it is such a fundamental requirement.  Or what do you think is the position?     Could it be said that a vehicle that has been manufactured without meeting that requirement is fit for purpose?  For the purpose for which these vehicles are made?     Yes.     You cannot...     Yes.     But you...  It is possible that some people might think it would not be properly fit for purpose.  But maybe others would say it is fit for purpose.     It is like there is room for these different views.     Yes.     Yes.     But even those who might say it is fit for purpose.  In saying so, they would not be... they would have to accept that there is a serious risk to the passengers.     Yes.     Ja, ja.     Okay alright.  Mr Kennedy.     The purpose of the report is to state your position and people may have... other people may have their own views about the issues that you cover in the report but it reflects your position.     Okay.     Okay, ja.  Alright.     Thank you, Mr Kennedy.  Thank you very much, Mr Mlipha for coming to assist the Commission.  We appreciate it very much.  If we need you to come back, we will ask you again but thank you very much.  You are now excused.     Thank you.  Mr Kennedy.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     I think that ten o’clock will be a problem.  But I have indicated that tomorrow to sitting until beyond five might be a problem.     But I think as I see this situation now, we could sit up to six tomorrow.     So there is room for that unless something changes.     So in terms of starting let us start at ten.     But there is a possibility of being able to go up to six if necessary. ADV KENNEDY     If we have to – if you cannot go beyond five we will adjourn at five but in that event I would be willing to explore the possibility of starting quite early on Friday.     And when I say quite early, depending on everyone’s situation, maybe started at even half past eight.     On Friday.     Half past eight or nine, depending on where we will be because on Friday also we need to – we will not be able to use the whole day because of my commitment.     So we could explore how early we could start.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.  No, tomorrow morning we cannot start before ten.     But on Friday we could start earlier than ten.  If there are problems obviously in the afternoon for counsel to be here beyond five or thereabouts, so even if I am available we will accommodate counsel.     Ja, okay, alright.  So the witnesses for tomorrow, who have we got?     Okay.  No, that is fine.     Okay, we will adjourn for the day.  We adjourn. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  If we may proceed with Mr Mlambo’s evidence that he started yesterday?    Mr Mlambo you gave evidence yesterday about a process in which you were asked to give approval as the – as the Group Executive Supply Chain Management for a particular transaction relating to 217 or 183 items of equipment – the armoured hulls for the Hoefyster contract and we got to the point where you had explained your correspondence with officials and – and then you escalated it when you were not satisfied with the process by sending emails to Mr Saloojee and Mr Wessels and others to express your reasons why you were not prepared to approve the transaction pointing out the serious irregularities.    Now you – we touched yesterday on your points that you did not receive any response from Mr Saloojee or anybody else that you had sent the – the email to.  Mr Saloojee has been asked to give further evidence before the commission to deal with issues that have been raised by other witnesses against him. And I just want to put to you the version that Mr Saloojee intends to give before the commission which as I understand it is the – is to the effect that he received your email; he noted it; he did not respond to it directly to you instead he discussed it with his colleagues including Mr Wessels and he understood that there was a solution found that resolved these issues and that is why he did not respond to you. Do you have any comment on that?    Now you started just before we adjourned yesterday.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Mlambo you mentioned as you were finishing your evidence yesterday afternoon the position paper and then I said to you that let us leave that until the morning because that is going to take a little time.  Could you please turn in that bundle to page 793?      Is this the – is this the position paper that you were referring to yesterday?    And may I ask you please to turn to page 795 it bears your name and title Denis Mlambo Supply Chain Executive Manager.  Is that your signature?    And are those your initials next to where the person has – has amended the date?    Mr Wessels.  So it is also signed apart from yourself by Mr Jan Wessels the Group COO and Mr Mhlontlo the Group Financial Director?    Please tell the Chair how it came about that this position paper was prepared?    May I just ask?  I am sorry Chair if I might – sorry for interrupting you.  Was that the – was that arising from the email that we looked at yesterday addressed to them and Mr Saloojee and others saying this is the problem with awarding the contract to VR Laser?  Was it in response to that that Mr Wessels came to you and said there may be an amicable solution to this issue?    If I can take you – I am not going to go through all the reasons for your recommendation that  that LMT be given this contract but if I can start at page 793 you see halfway down a heading Evaluation.    And just read to the Chair please the first two lines.    Just immediately after the word evaluation.    Now you mentioned yesterday that one of the concerns was a group policy to try and supply in-house where you had a subsidiary or a division that could do – could do the work.  Was that what informed the point here in your position paper?    Now you then express   And then your second point is that LMT has already manufactured some prototype hulls – does have a nominal experience base line from where to work and improve.  You refer to them having real operational capacity and managerial challenges at LMT as identified by DLS management.  What did that relate to without going into detail just at a broad level?    And then your next arrow says   Now on the next page that is page 794 if I can just read out I think it is a sentence. “It is our considered position that given Denel’s strategic relationship with LMT and despite the challenges at LMT the intended sub-contract for the supply of the hull and accessories specialised doors and related mechanisms should not have been placed on tender but rather directly negotiated with LMT being a 51% Denel owned subsidiary.  However given the current status of supply chain process followed in this matter we advise that the tender process not be withdrawn and since no selection or pronouncement has yet been made DLS simply implements our preferred way forward as suggested in this paper without further communication.” So that was the recommendation and then you refer to certain improvements further down where the arrow points are set out.  This – this recommendation that you then prepared and it signed by Mr Wessels and Mr Mhlontlo when the word recommendation appears there who was it a recommendation to?    Do you know whether it went to Mr Saloojee for approval?    Thank you.  Did Mr Saloojee have any discussions with you about this proposed solution?    And the upshot of this decision if it had been implemented would that have meant that VR Laser would or would not get any work for this project – for this part of the project?    Right.  Did you believe that it was resolved on this basis?    Now your affidavit refers to your being shocked about what you learnt thereafter.  Can you tell the Chair please what you learnt and why you were shocked?    And apart from the input you had previously given in the emails and your discussions with the officials – your email to Mr Saloojee etcetera and the position paper had there ever any – been any opportunity given to you prior to your learning that there was this award to give input?    May I take you please to the same bundle page 797.  It is one of the attachments to your affidavit.      797.    Do you have that?    What is this document?    Is that the – is that the procurement that we have been dealing with yesterday and today?    And what is the outcome of this document?  What does it record?    Now if we look at the signatures page 804 there is a recommendation from DLS EXCO.  It has the signature of Ms Malahlela who has already given evidence in relation to this recommendation and how she came to sign it.  It is also a recommendation from – is it Ms Africa.    [00   And then we see the signature of Mr Saloojee on page 806 for the approval of the recommendation.  He will give evidence that he did sign this as approving it as Group CEO.  Now you have raised a couple of difficulties in relation to this process. Firstly that you were – this was done behind your back as it were.  Is that a fair representation?    Yes including Mr Saloojee’s.    You have indicated to the Chair that you should have confirmed compliance with the processes before such a contract could be approved.    And you had specifically said it did not comply with the processes?    And also you have said that the board’s approval was required but it was approved instead by Mr Saloojee?    Yes we…    No it is different.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.  Mr Mlambo can I just put to you a point that Mr Wessels has indicated to us as a team where he – his version diverges from yours to an extent.  What his version is; is that the – the solution that was found was suggested by him to this dilemma and it meant that work would be split between VR Laser and LMT.  And LMT would only do certain components such as the rear door and VR Laser would do the rest.  Is that – was that discussed with you?  If I can just take you back to your position paper there seems to be a reference to rear door work being done.  Page 794.      If you look at – if I can just take you to the place and then you can continue.  794 the second    Were the doors not part of this contract?    So am I understanding you correctly that the – that the hulls that were – that were recommended for approval to go to VR Laser you had objected to? MR    Right.    So the solution that you found with Mr Wessels as you understood it reflected in the position paper was that VR Laser would get no work under the hull contract.  That work would go to LMT because it was an in-house company and it was good on price and capacity and so forth.  Management and performance issues would be resolved and in addition LMT would get further work on top of the hulls such as the doors?    Now to the extent that Mr Wessels or Mr Saloojee may tell the commission that this was a solution – this was a compromise VR Laser would get – would get – get the main part of the work – LMT would get some other work and that this resolved the concerns that you had raised.  Do you believe that your concerns and objections were answered or not – properly answered or not?    Now if I can take you please to your affidavit page 711.  Paragraph 3.16.    711.  Top number.     On this page, on the following page in your paragraphs 3.16 and 3.17.  You refer to what seems to be some history, background about the acquisition of LMT or the acquisition of a majority shareholding.   Is there anything that you want to add to what you have said to the Chair yesterday in relation to LMT and why it was significant in relation to the award of this business, to LMT, the Hull contract?     Mr Mlambo, may we now turn to a section of your affidavit, paragraph 4 which is headed into interference by Messrs Burger and Thebus with the integrity of the procurement process at DOS.   And you refer to a number of emails that the Commission’s investigators had shown you that were exchanged between Mr Thebus and Ms Malahlela and Mr Thebus.     Dealing with why they felt that VR Laser should still get what Thebus, in particular, and Burger felt that VR Laser should nonetheless be awarded the contract.  You indicated that you had... you were not copied in on those emails at the time.       May I ask you now please to turn to page 809?  It is 808, in fact.     In our affidavit, as I have pointed out earlier, you deal with the history that goes back to the acquisition of LMT.  So these are minutes of a special DLS board meeting.  Now that is the Division Board.     On the 31s t of March 2011.  And why is this significant in your view, particularly if you have regard to paragraph 6 of the minute?     Thank you.  May I draw your attention to the very last small paragraph in that column. “The new investor is also buying in on the basis of the future value of the combined businesses of the three parties and from more strategic reasons than financial reasons.   The proposal is that DLS and Denel should exercise the option within one year.” Now you mentioned earlier in your evidence yesterday that there was a strategic reason that Denel felt persuaded by to acquire LMT.  What was your understanding of that strategic reasoning from a group point of view?     And was there an importance attached to having that capacity brought in-house, as it were, as a partly owned subsidiary of Denel?     Now Mr Mlambo, may we now turn to paragraph 5 of your affidavit?  You do not need to go to it yourself.  I am just giving it as a guidance of the Chair.  You deal with the enquiries submitted to VR Laser Services regarding the identity of its individual shareholders. And you referred to Ms Malahlela taking certain action in that regard and she has given evidence on the enquiry she made.  And then you say you engage in correspondence with Mr Aurora of the Managing Director of VR Laser.      How did that come about?  How did it come about that you were aware of it and you started intervening or taking action?     May I take you now please to page 822?     Yes.  That is a letter from VR Laser’s Chief Operating Officer, Mr Jiyane and that confirms that the shareholders in VR Laser were Elgasolve and Craig Shaw and gives the percentages, 74.9% and 25.1%.     That they are the shareholders.  They do not have any involvement or conflict doing business with Denel or the shareholders or directors of private individuals who do not work for government.   It did not disclose though who the shareholders of those companies were and that was your concern.  Do I understand your earlier evidence right?     If I may take you please to page 817?  There are a number of other emails.  It seems that you corresponded not only with Mr Aurora but also Mr Van der Merwe of VR Laser.  But I can take you to ...[intervenes]      817.  817 – 8, appears to be an email from Mr Aurora apologising for his failure to do something.      And then it says    And then he says    Now page 816, you sent an email back     Right.  This appears to be an email from you back to Mr Aurora thanking him for his response     Sorry, apologies Chair ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  So now that was correspondence I November 2014 and prior to that.  You have indicated, you did not get a response.  If I can take you now to page 820?       The email about halfway down the page appears to have been from you in March 2015.       So this is four months after your email, more than four months after your email as of 21s t  of November and you address it to Mr Aurora and you     Is that correct?     Yes. “We are a last month of our financial year-end and the audit process may uncover inconsistencies in Denel’s interactions with its suppliers.”     And he does not give you the answers     Yes.  If you look on then previous page, 818.  That is the letter that came from Aurora and his initials are JP.  So you believe that is who he is referring to?     Page 818, the previous page.     Right.  So you understood Mr Van der Merwe to be referring to Mr Aurora ...[intervenes]      ...when he says JP.     So he says    And then he asks his questions. “In order to provide you with the correct details, can I assume you need the following documents details?  Details of shareholders, percentage shareholding in VR Laser, details of the shareholding of the shareholders in VR...” And then other items that he sets out relating to the directors as well. And you then respond on the 2n d of April 2015 in the email at the top of this page.   “Thanks for your response.  You have indeed interpreted my request quite well.  In light of the request, it is imperative that the claimed one hundred percent black shareholding in VR Laser Services be confirmed through the evidence you will submit.” You confirm that you repeated your request for this and its importance?     Now the evidence has been that by this stage in March/April 2015, the contract had already long since been awarded to VR Laser in the process that you have indicated did not meet with your approval.     Were you aware of that when you sent this correspondence?     What were you trying to achieve by getting this information?  Were you still under the impression that no contract had been awarded?  I doubt this information was relevant to the award of the contract.  Was that your approach?     Can I take you back to page 801?     This is part of the document we looked at earlier that was signed by various executives by not by you which ...[intervenes]     801, yes.      It is the table.  I am just guiding you.  This is part of the document that you confirmed earlier that was signed on the 16t h of October by executives excluding yourself, we see that at page 805, we looked at that earlier.     As part of this submission that was approved excluding you.  They have referred correctly at page 801 to the breakdown for scoring purposes and you see just above the table, basis for comparative offer price, 25%, technical 45%, BEE 30%.  So 30% of scoring would actually come from the BEE perspective.     Even more than the price.  So your enquiries in relation to the BEE credentials of VR Laser, how important did you regard this as important for purposes a proper evaluation of tenders before they were awarded?     Thank you.     Thank you, I would like to turn to a different topic now and a different contract.  Mr Mlambo, you do not need to go back to your statement at this stage, just keep the – just move now to page 824.     Just for the Chairperson’s guidance, he deals with this, Chair, in paragraph 6 of his affidavit from page 715 and following.     Now you deal there in terms of your heading, Mr Mlambo, with a topic which you described as a single agreement entered into between DLS and VR Laser Services in 2015.  Now we have already dealt with the hull contract.     Yesterday afternoon and this morning.  Now this is a different contract, is it?     It was entered into in 2015 and it related to a single source appointment of VR Laser Services by DLS, correct?     Now I would like you please to look at page 824 and 825, it is a memorandum that comes from Ms Malahlela as executive manager in DLS supply chain department and it was sent addressed to the Denel supply chain executive.  Am I right in understanding that that was yourself?     What did you understand from this memorandum, was the purpose of it and what were you being asked to do?     Now she refers in her background section at the top of the text on page 824 to approval being given for the deviation from the normal procurement processes, etcetera, to be used for the T5 demo and group supply chain executive gave an instruction that DLS must first explore how Denel Vehicle Systems, Gear Ratio, that is what is being referred to elsewhere as DVS, is that right?     That is a sister division of DLS.     And then she refers also to this relating to LMT which, as you have indicated already, was a partly owned company controlled by Denel with a 51% shareholding.      So she seems to be referring to a previous decision by group supply chain executive, in other words at head office level, to prefer DVS and LMT for the supply of items on the basis that they were in-house, as it were, provided they met the requirements for quality, price and delivery.  Is she here reflecting what you were referring to yesterday?  Is she correctly reflecting what you understood the group policy to be?     Then her next paragraph says    And she refers to the group policy     Yes.  And where we looked yesterday at the delegation of authority and there was a reference to consultation with you as the group supply chain executive or manager, as it was called there, was that subject to this special provision saying you must not only be consulted if there is to be – if there is a to be a deviation from this, you must also give your approval that it is for sound business reasons.     Then she says in the third paragraph     And then she continues    And then what she is saying is, she is saying what has actually happened has been that VR Laser, a non-group entity has been awarded this contract already and there is a contradiction between that and the policy and Exco has said they want you to approve it.  Is my understanding correct of his memo?     And we will get to why in a moment but the main point that you had to use as a test for whether to not to give approval was whether it was for sound business reasons not to give the work in-house but to give it to an outsider.     That was the test that you had to apply.     So let me – I am sorry.     Oh, I am sorry, I did not realise, sorry, Chair.     Perhaps I can just finish this thought.     Because he has just mentioned his notes.  Thank you, Chair.     For the record, may I then, Chair, just read into the record – Mr Mlambo, your note that you are referred to, is that the handwritten note slotting MB?     And is that your handwriting?     If I can just read it out    Okay, if I might just have one further question?     And you say that that proof has to be given by the in-house companies prior to the contract being awarded.  It seems from the body of Ms Malahlela’s letter in the second last paragraph on page 824 that she confirms that DLS had already signed the memorandum of agreement with VR Laser in May 2015, five months before they were asking you to approve it.  Any comment on that?     Are you referring to his signature, Mr Ntshepe’s signature on page 825?     And above his signature someone has written in the word “approved” is that your handwriting?     Thank you, Chair.     We follow judicial precedents.     It is spreading like a virus, Chair.       Thank you, Chair.  Mr Mlambo, we were talking about the refusal by you to sign Ms Malahlela’s memorandum where she conveyed Exco’s request, DLS Exco’s request for you to approve the award of the single source contract to VR Laser which you say was overruled by Mr Ntshepe as CEO.  Can I take you now to page 837?     Thank you.  May I then turn to page 837?  This is a letter from Stephan Burger, DLS’ CEO, it was addressed to you and at the end of the letter there is a blank space where it says approved by, approval Dennis Mlambo, Group Supply Chain Executive.  So was this an attempt by Mr Burger to get you to again to give approval?     And here the document has the date in small print on page 837, 29 April 2016.  So this is long after the date of Ms Malahlela’s memorandum that the Chair has just been asking you about.     And then Mr Burger starts by thanking you for a meeting held at DCO with Mr Odwa Mhlwana and yourself on the 28 April 2016.  Do you confirm that you had such a meeting?     And then he says in paragraph 2 that he confirms you discussion that a single source supplier agreement, the MOA had been entered into with VR Laser on the 19 May 2015 pursuant to a motivation being submitted to DCO.  It was recommended for approval by both the then Group Executive Business Development, Mr Zwelakhe Ntshepe.  Is that the same person who later acted as Group CEO when Mr Saloojee was suspended?      There is also recommended by the Group COO, Mr Jan Wessels, was then approved by the     Is it binding on Denel?     Then to continue in Mr Burger’s letter     And the earlier part of the letter referred to the previous award of the contract without your approval to VR Laser of the single source provision.     So he asks for your approval and you have indicated that you refused that.     Are those the reasons in the handwritten portion next to the letters NB?     Below the blank line that was meant for your signature to approve you instead refused to sign that and instead set out your reasons for refusal.     And again is that you signature at the bottom right after this handwriting?     If I may read for the record your     And then paragraph 4 sets our your     Yes, thank you.     Yes, he will be giving evidence at a later stage, Chair.     And he will be asked to deal with that.     May I ask the witness, Chair, to just give an example of what you understand would constitute the type of emergency that makes it impractical.     Thank you, Chair.  What was the outcome of this – your second – the second time that you were refusing to give your approval or a contract that had already been awarded?  What then happened with that?     Yes.  Yes, you are right, you do say that.  Let me just get you the …[intervenes]     Sorry, did you mention 849?     839, thank you.     Yes.     Yes, Chair, may I just indicate, his affidavit, the witness’s affidavit refers to this annexure as being showing that Mr Ntshepe overruled.  This, of course, is the same document that we looked at a bit earlier.     And that was at page 824 to 5.  It is exactly the same document.     Yes.     Yes.     May I just ask the witness to confirm that?  Mr Mlambo you have referred to this at 841 as being the overruling by Mr Ntshepe.     Right.     Right.  Okay, thank you.  Now we can move off this contract.  So we have dealt with now the second contract which is the VLS contract awarded for a sole supply – single supplier to VR Laser.  Now is it correct that there was another process followed by DVS, Denel Vehicle Systems to award a similar contract for their product needs to VR Laser as a single source supplier?     Now you deal with that in your affidavit.  If I can just give the Chair the reference, that is from page 722, Chair.  Now may I take you …[intervenes]3     722, yes.     May I take you now, Mr Mlambo to a document that you referred to in your affidavit that relates to this.  If I can take you please to 843.     843, that is correct.     Now the first email there seems to be an email from a Mr Johan Steyn, is that correct?     Who was Mr Steyn in the Denel Group?     So he was the equivalent of Mr Stephan Burger in the other division, DLS?     Alright.  Now I am just going to read     Now can you tell the Chair please what was being proposed in relation to DVS?     Thank you.  And were you asked for your approval from the supply chain management executive’s perspective for what was being proposed?     Was there any financial detriment?     You refer in your affidavit to Mr Steyn discussing a higher cost that would be involved with VR Laser.  Do you recall that?      What did he tell you?     By how much?   15%.        May I just have a moment, Chair?  Alright, may I just mention, Chair, at page – Chair, may I just indicate this – well, perhaps I should take the witness to it.  Can I take you in your affidavit please, Mr Mlambo, to page 722.  You refer in paragraph 7.1, 722 is the page.     Yes.  7.1 and 7.2 refers to Mr Steyn saying he had received the instruction to put an MOA in place for DVS with VR Laser and he expressed his reservations and the 15% is there mentioned and then you     Sorry, DVS, not the DLS that we were referring to earlier.  Do you in fact have that document available to you?      Alright, thank you.  Chair, may we undertake that we will produce that for your records.     To have it admitted.     We just need to - it is not an annexure to another witness’s affidavit.     We are not quite sure at this stage.     We will do that, thank you Chair.       What then happened with this project to award a sole supplier contract for DVS’s requirements to VR Laser, that was instructed by the now Group Chief Executive Mr  Ntshepe, which you were asked to approve, which you refused to approve, what then happened, was it ultimately awarded?     Okay, but you do not have personal knowledge as to that?     Alright, thank you.  Now may I now turn – leave that contractor the DVS contract to another contract which is referred to as the Chad contract in your affidavit.  Tell the Chair please what was this Chad contract for?      Chair, thank you.  Mr Mlambo you have dealt briefly now in the last few minutes with a number of topics all of which are set out in some detail in your affidavit the Chad contract, the Bowman’s report, the authenticity of the letter, your approach to – your concern about the intellectual property not being established and then also and I do not propose Chair unless you would like me to go through any of that in any detail…[intervene]     Because I think he has covered very usefully the broad outline.     And Mr Mlambo you confirm all your evidence in your affidavit specifically in relation to that and also the annexures that you put up in support of that?     The appointment of the auditors was that the appointment of Ernst & Young that is referred to in your affidavit?     I am sorry yes it was Kopano was it not who was actually awarded.      Yes, but just summarise in a sentence or two if you would for the Chair ’s assistance.  What was the difficulty in relation to the appointment of the auditors? MR     Thank you Chair may I just conclude these questions by asking this, had you started with Denel in 2004?      And you worked continuously there until you left in the circumstances that you have just outlined to the Chair.       In 2019 so it was 15 years afterwards.  How did you feel when you left?  How did you feel about the circumstances in which you came to leave?      Thank you those are our questions Chair.     Thank you Chair may we call our next witness.     May I just indicate the next witness is not the person who directed email correspondence to the Commission that was the subject of discussion earlier.     Now his situation will be clarified and dealt with on a later date.     We propose now to call as the next witness Mr Nkosi, Mr Phumlane Nkosi who I believe is present.      May I ask that he then come to the witness Chair and then be sworn in?     As you please Chair.     Thank you Chair I confirm that our next witness who is now in the witness box is Mr Phumlane Nkosi.    May he be sworn in please?    Thank you Chair.    Good afternoon Mr Nkosi.  Mr Nkosi is it correct that you have provided at the request of the commission an affidavit which is – it should be in front of you in the bundle.    Chair for the record the bundle that I am referring to is Denel Bundle 03.    And it is Exhibit W13.    Mr Nkosi would you please look at the document – you will see that there are various page numbers look on the top left hand side of each page you will see page numbers – do you see that Denel -03-004?  You have that?    For convenience we will just refer to the number here as being 4 – we will not read out the whole thing.  You confirm that this is – it is referred to as a statement but this is in fact your affidavit?    And may I take you please to page..    And try and just look towards the Chair if you would not mind even though the questions are coming from me just so that he hears you clearly.  And can I ask you please to turn to page 27.      Is that your signature above the typed Phumlane Nkosi?    And you signed that before a Commissioner of Oaths whose details and signature appear on the following page?    You confirm that this in fact sets out your evidence in written form of an affidavit?    And do you – have you been through this affidavit to confirm that you are happy with the contents as being true and correct?    And – right.  Thank you Chair we would ask then formally for leave to have this affidavit and its annexures admitted in – as evidence of the commission Denel Bundle 03 Exhibit W13.    Thank you Chair.  Chair I propose with your leave to go through particularly the introductory parts very briefly and to lead the witness on issues that are uncontroversial.    Mr Nkosi you are a Mechanical Engineer is that right?    You hold degrees of Bachelor of Science as well as an MSC in Leadership and Innovation?    And then you have various other qualifications.  You are employed where at the moment?    Armscor.  And when did you start?    2009?    Your affidavit refers to your being initially at Armscor as a trainee engineer in 2000 to 2002 and then you moved elsewhere to CSIR, is that right?    And then you joined BAE Land Systems South Africa?    Is that the entity also known sometimes as BLSSA?    The current DVS?    Yes.  Previously was owned by the British Arms Group BAE but it was acquired later by Denel.    And then it is now known as DVS Denel Vehicle Systems, is that correct?    So you worked there for what years?    And is that when you moved then over from Denel to Armscor?    And in what capacity?    Right.  And then you were promoted to what position?    Team Leader?    For what?    And is that the position you hold currently?    Now your affidavit if you can look at page 6 again look at the top left hand numbers.  The last digit is 6 paragraph 3.  You set out there your roles and responsibilities.    Now I am going to just leave it on the basis that obviously the Chair has the affidavit before the commission and has the opportunity or has had the opportunity to read through all of that detail.  I do not believe Chair with subject to your guidance that it is necessary for us….    To take him through that.    Mr Nkosi you deal in the body of your affidavit with a number of issues relating to standards that had to be met and RSA Mil – M-i-l standard 37.  You deal with a number of tests that are referred to as TP2 and TP3 tests.  Before we get into that just explain your role as an Armscor Official in this particular job that you hold now what role if any do you have to play in relation to testing arms – items of arms or components of arms and weapons?    Yes.  Now you refer in your affidavits and again we will get into the detail in a moment to a need for tests to be done for certain items relating to the Hoefyster contract.    You confirm that?    Right and what were those items?    Yes I am asking sorry to interrupt.  What items are we talking about?    The vehicles?    These are armoured vehicles?    Under the Hoefyster contract?    And were these being purchased by Armscor from Denel?    And Armscor would supply whom with those armoured vehicles?    SANDF?    Right.  And is it Armscor’s function to test the vehicles for something specific?    Can Denel or its divisions or entities do their own testing or do you – are – is Armscor ultimately responsible?    Right.  Now again Chair subject to your guidance I am going to be very brief in trying to get the witness to explain.    In very layman’s terms lay person terms.    Some technical issues and Mr Nkosi can you just please bear in mind that we are – we are on the legal side rather than the mechanical engineering side so please assist us in our – certainly in my ignorance on technical aspects such as this.  Were you in your capacity that you have described personally responsible for testing these armoured vehicles in relation to the Hoefyster contract or at least ensuring that proper tests were done?    Yes.  So long before you joined there were certain tests that were done?    And you have indicated in your affidavit concerns about the adequacy or the correctness of the tests that were done.    And were they specifically done on armoured vehicles that were being manufactured as part of the Hoefyster Project?    Thank you. How many tests were done – are you aware of in 2005?    Three tests?    Okay. And your affidavit refers to a Mr Frans Beetge.    Who was he or is he?    So you replaced him?    In what year?    Yes I understand what understudy means.  Now Mr Beetge you have recorded in your affidavit has sadly passed away.    Did – and – when he left the employ of Armscor how did he leave the employ of Armscor?    Right.    Okay.  Now Mr Nkosi was he the person occupying the position you later took over at the time of the tests – the three tests that you have referred to as having been done in 2005?    And did he – did he convey to you information about what tests have been done?    Did he provide you with documentation in that regard?    Alright thank you.  Now you refer in your affidavit to a standard that is referred to as RSA-Mil standard 37 if I can take you to page 8.    Your paragraph 4 has a heading Summary of the RSA-Mil standard 37 issue 3.  Now am I right in understanding Mil there means military?    Okay.  Now can you just very, very briefly Mr Nkosi I do not want you to go into considerable technical detail but can you just explain to us in a sentence or two what the standard is, who lays it down, what is its purpose?    Right.  So is the – is the main object of a test to ensure that the vehicle has sufficient protection against the damage that might be caused if the vehicle came into contact with an explosive device such as a landmine?    Right.  Now you refer in your affidavit to two tests.  You refer to them as test piece 2 or TP2 and I am going to use the abbreviation and test piece 3.    TP2 and TP3.  Were they tests that were part of this RSA-Mil standard 37 issue 3?    Yes.    Do you have any issue with any test relating to these vehicles in the Hoefyster Project that relate to the TP1 test?    TP2 and TP3.    And is that is why have dealt with those in your affidavit rather than TP1?    Okay.  Now what is the – what specifically does TP2 test seek to test as compared with TP3?  Again very briefly from a technical point of view.  What is TP2 test?    Right.    Right.    Sorry did the Chair – I think the Chair wants to ask something.    Thank you may I proceed?  Thank you.  May I just ask Mr Nkosi page 10 paragraph 4.6 until 4.9 on the following page.  Does that set out in more technical terms the different elements of the TP2 test?    Thank you.  And have you employed the same approach in relation to the TP3 test the details are set out in paragraph 5 page 11 to 12?    Just explain to us though in layman’s terms TP3 test how does that compare with the TP2 test?    The final one.    Right.  So before you get to a TP3 test you must have passed the TP2 test?    Right.  And once you have passed that then you can be considered further for the project but that is subject to a TP3 test being passed?    Right.    Now is it possible to supply to the end user in this case the South African National Defence Force who will then allocate human beings to sit in these armoured vehicles.  Is it possible to supply to the SANDF an armoured vehicle which has not passed the TP2 and then the TP3 test?    Would that be because just correct me if I am wrong and my layman’s understanding.  The TP2 and the TP3 tests are there to ensure that the vehicle – the armoured vehicle is sufficiently compliant with requirements to try and minimise damage to vehicles and destruction or injury – sorry destruction of vehicles or injury to humans or their deaths    Yes.  Right now let us get to you involvement in relation to reviewing information regarding the landmine tests.  You deal with that in your affidavit from page 12 paragraph 6, correct?  And so you have already testified that the two tests in question were done in 2005.    Sorry three tests I beg your pardon correct.  In 2005 many years before you even joined.  So you were not involved in those tests but what was your involvement in relation to those tests?  Your affidavit refers to your discussions with Mr Beetge who had been involved in the tests and were you required then as your heading suggests paragraph 6 to reviewing information relating to two tests in question?    Right.  And from the information you obtained from Mr Beetge presumably both what he said and what he provided in the form the documentary evidence that you refer to were you able to satisfy yourself that a test had been conducted for TP2?  Let us leave aside whether it was a proper test – whether it was passed or not.  Had there been an attempt to undergo a TP2 test for the vehicles in question?    For TP2 tests?    Did you say?    Sorry I just did not hear you.  And what about the TP3 test was that done?    Thank you Chair would this be a convenient time?    Thank you.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Nkosi, we were dealing with some backgrounds ...[intervenes]      Sorry?     Water?     Can someone help with water?     Now Mr Nkosi, you have explained to the Chair before we took the adjournment about the difference about the TP2 and TP3 tests, both of which had to be passed. And particularly the TP3 test as being the ultimate test before products could be supplied to the end user.  In this case, the SANDF.   Now you have referred to a number of tests that were done before you started in your current... in your position, taking over from Mr Beetge.   What, in very broad outline, did you discover?  How many tests were conducted for TP2 in 2005?     Right.     With who?     The CSIR?     Which came first?     By Armscor?     And ordinarily, would Armscor conduct these tests itself?     Yes.  You mentioned in your affidavit, you have touched on this earlier, that in Armscor, in fact, has a legal authority, a legal status in relation to the certification of arms components or items such as this.  Is it in fact as the statutory authority, the legal authority to pursue?     Okay.     And then there were two... so there were two processes that you have just reminded us of in 05, had three tests done.  Is that right?     And was any TP3 tests done in 2005?     Just explain to the Chair what a baseline is, please?     And did you discuss with Mr Beetge what the outcome of the first test was in 2005?     Is it?     Okay.  What was ...[intervenes]      Okay.  Well, we will get to that  If you can just ...[intervenes]      And if you could please just try and remember.  I know it is difficult but try and look towards the Deputy Chief Justice, the Chair rather than me even though I am giving most of the questions.     Because it will be easier for the Chair then to hear and it will also pick up on your microphone in that direction.     Okay.  So what was the outcome of the first test?  Did the vehicles...  These are called Patria vehicles, is that right?     Did those Patria vehicles, in fact, passed or failed the first test?     Is it correct that there are different elements to the tests?     Okay.  So ...[intervenes]      Yes.  And you deal with this in some detail in your affidavit which the Chair will be able to go through.  Can you just confirm?  So some of the elements of the first TP2 tests that these vehicles were subjected to, some of those have passed and others not.     Okay.     So what was the overall outcome of the test itself ...[intervenes]      So it failed the hull...?     Hull shot?     Alright.       And how important is that as an element?     What is the significance if you fail that particular element of the TP2 test?     Okay.     Now ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  And did Mr Beetge discuss this problem with the very first test that he had been involved in with you when you were... when he was handing over to you?     Now you refer in your affidavit to a report which came from the CSIR documenting the requirements of Armscor from the test.  This is the... I just want to confirm.  Yes, that is the first test.  This is in your affidavit, page 15.  If you look at the top left numbers, 15.       Paragraph 8.2.       You refer to the report referring to LMT and not Patria as the provider of the item to be tested.  Do you know...  Can you explain that?     Okay.     And then you refer to an executive summary of the report in 8.4.     The third line of 8.4.   “The test team passed the wheel-test but failed the hull-test due to great than thresholds.” What is the... the ...[indistinct] forces.   “This objects prevailing the interior of assessed item and penetration of the hull by the blast.”     So was this your understanding of the reason why it failed this test?     Yes.     Alright.     The end of ...[intervenes]      Let me just have a moment to clarify something, please Chair.     May I take you please Mr Nkosi to page 254?  Sorry, 255.       Yes.       Do you have it?     Please turn to page 255.       Please just go to the page number I have given you.     Is this the CSIR report that you are referring to which was done for the first test with Armscor?     Is that the second test?     That is the third test?     Yes.     Yes, but you filed the various reports in your... as part of your annexures to your affidavit, not so?     Okay.  Sorry about the wrong reference, Chair.     Right.  Then the...  You then deal with a second test also conducted in 2005 on these vehicles, correct?     That is the third.     But we know that it is not the first.     You have clarified that.     Thank you.  May I just take you back to your evidence so that we do not jump ahead to the third test.  Let us get back to the end of the first test.  That was a catastrophic failure.     As you put it.  Now then there was a second test and that you deal with on page 16, your paragraph 9.     Again, it was conducted in 2005 long before you joined?     And what was the outcome...  Sorry.  Who submitted the vehicles for the second test?     It was LMT?     Just speak up, please.  And try to look towards the Chair.     So the question was, who sent it for a test?  The answer is LMT did.     And but did not involve Armscor?     Should it have involved Armscor?     Now where the first test that resulted in a catastrophic failure, you indicate in your affidavit, paragraph 9.2 ...[intervenes]      ...that the...  It is not documented why the Patria vehicle was allowed to undergo the second test after there was a catastrophic failure of the first test.  Why is that?     Okay you do not know.  It was not explained there.     But if I were to submit a vehicle for the TP2 test and it results in a catastrophic failure, does that mean I have to close down that business?  I can never carry on.  I can never improve or correct it?     Okay.  Now what was the outcome of that second test?     And from your study of the documents, was it appropriate that they passed the test?     Okay.  And then in 9.3 you say    Who in Armscor interpreted the outcome of this test to be a TP2 test?     Your... Is that Mr Beetge?     Okay.  Did he raise any concerns about the outcome of this thing?     Now ...[intervenes]      Thank you, Chair.  So am I right in saying that in understanding that the TP2 test involves a number of elements?     And are you saying that some of those elements were not even tested?     They were not even tested in the CSIR.  So they did some but not others?     Now you set out a number of technical issues from 9.3.1 ...[intervenes]      ...to 9.3.21.     As being discrepancies that were identified.     What are those discrepancies?  Does that refer to elements of the test not even being tested?     Is that right?     So in other words, the test was...  There was a test done but it was not a comprehensive test.  They only tested for a few things.     And whatever ...[intervenes]  MR     Okay.     Yes.  Now as a result of that test, was any certificate issued by Armscor?     Even though that they should not have been bypassed by LMT going directly to CSIR?     And even though, also, the test by CSIR was not a comprehensive test and many of the elements were not even tested?     Okay.     Can I ask you to turn in the bundle to page 46?     Just have a quick glance at that document and just confirm.  I want you to indicate whether you are able to tell us whether this was the CSIR report for the first test or the second test or anything else.     Yes?     So this was before the first two tests?     So this was not the first test?     And maybe if I can ask you please to turn to page 138?     That also seems to be a CSIR report.     138.  Yes, Chair.     This one is dated the 14t h of June 2005 which is a little after the other test we just looked at.     Yes.  Is this the test report for the first or the second test that you referred us to, the TP2 test?     Or ...[intervenes]      Of the first test?     Right.  And if I can ask you now please to turn to page 255?     That is also dated 2005.  August 2005.  Are you able to indicate whether this was the report for the second ...[intervenes]      Was this the third test?     That is page 256?     Yes.  Okay.       Thank you.  But did Armscor later accept this test as having been passed?     Was passing the TP2 test a requirement of the contract in a sense of if you do not comply then you are in breach of contract?     Alright.  Now you have said that you are not sure why Beetge acted in the way he did.  Did he express anything to you as to whether he was happy with how he had acted?     Yes.     So am I right in understanding what you are saying that he was fairly relaxed about agreeing that the passed the TP2 test because he took comfort from the fact that well, if there are any shortcoming they will be picked up at the TP3 stage.     And you cannot deliver vehicles to the customer unless and until the TP3 test has been passed.     Okay.     May I just put to the witness a version that will be given by …[intervenes]     Dr Nell.     From LMT.     Who has given us an affidavit and he has been referred to your affidavit and your comments you believe, as you have said in 9.4 of your affidavit, it was incorrect for Armscor to issue certificates for landmine protection.  Dr Nell will say before the Commission that at the completion of the LT – sorry, the TP2 test, Armscor congratulated LMT and issued certificates. That was before your time, correct?     Yes.  Does that give you any reassurance was to what was done, whether it was good or bad? MR     Okay.     Right.  So you have testified that Armscor did issue a certificate despite the fact that there were shortcomings in the test, how it was done, as you have indicated.  Do those certificates last forever or did they last for a limited period? MR     Yes.  So you deal with that in your paragraph 10.     They were reissued in 2009.  What I am really asked for is an answer to this question.  Does there have – is there an automatic expiry of a certificate?  Why were the certificates reissued?  Why were they not just continuing?      Okay.     Mr Nkosi, may you please turn to page 302?   Do you have it?  I think that appears to be an Armscor certificate of product validation.     It says that it certifies that the mine protected Patria TP2 hull has been validated against an 8 kilogram TNH surrogate landmine underneath the crew compartment.  It gives the test number, it says it has been verified by Armscor in accordance with test procedure and it give the particular test procedure.     And then it says – it gives the certificate of validation number for land mobility technologies LMT (Pty) Ltd.  Is that the LMT that you have been referring to?     As the representative of Patria vehicles.  It was issued on the 7 September 2005.     Was that the first certificate that you were aware of arising from the TP2 tests in 2005?     304.     VO4 is dated …[intervenes]     303, right?  So 303 is dated the same date.      The 7 September 2005.     So there were two certificates issued in 2005.  Correct?     Yes and both of those certificates you felt were wrongly issued.     I see.     Okay.  So was that the one at page 303?     So it passed that?     Right, but the other one it did not pass and yet Armscor gave it a certificate saying it had passed.     Yes.     Okay.  And then the next certificate at page 304 is one issued in September 2009, 7 September 09.  Is this the certificate that your affidavit refers to as having been reissued?     Yes.     Okay.     Now …[intervenes]     Right.  Now was a further test actually done by LMT for this vehicle before the reissuing of the certificate in 2009 from what you were able to learn from Mr Beetge or from the documents what were available to you?     There was no test.     What – you have a comment on whether it was acceptable or not to reissue a certificate where there was no further test?     You are referring to the test procedure on page [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Sorry, hold on, Mr Nkosi, please do not talk over when I am putting a question to you.     Because the Chair will not be to hear and the microphone will not record if we are both talking at once.     So can I just put the question, you are referring on page 302 to the number DEF.     2005/166 or 504.     Sorry, which one?     I see two numbers on this page, Mr Nkosi.     Both start with DEF 2005.     The first number refers to /166 and the second to 504.  Which one should we be looking at for your purposes?     Yes, which one?  Is it 166?     Mr Nkosi, will you not please …[intervenes]     I was putting to you questions relating to 302.     Okay.  So on 302 which one should we look at?  The test number which ends in 166 or the test procedure which ends in 504?     Sorry, which one is the test number?  Is it 166?     Right and where did they change it?     Yes, just show me where they changed it.     You said they changed it somewhere.  Where?     303, yes?     Yes.     159.     So that is the change …[intervenes]     166 instead of 159 that should have been the same?     Yes, I am not getting to 304 yet.     Yes.     So 302 we can ignore because that is the hull test?     Okay.     Okay.     So what was the problem with 303 that they needed to change? MR     Okay.     Okay.     So it was …[intervenes]     Okay but it was not because they had retested the vehicle.     And it was now passing.     It was because they wanted to change the number for reasons you do not know.     Okay.  Thank you.     Now in your affidavit you have a lengthy section that deals with your interactions with Mr Goosen, internal memorandum, a desktop study conducted in 2009 and a landmine blast analysis in August 2016 and then you go back to the internal memorandums.  In fact later internal memorandums between you and Mr Goosen on a landmine protection issue.     Now I would like you – you deal from paragraph 13.4.     I am giving you that in a moment.  Just bear with me, if you would?     Thank you, Chair.  From page 20 you deal with internal memo 1 and then memo 2 and then the affidavit goes on for some pages to deal with a whole lot of memos and so forth.      I do not believe, subject to the Chair ’s guidance, that it is necessary for us to go into all the detail of the memos, they are all available and you have analysed for the assistance of the Commission.     Can you just tell us, if you would please, Mr Nkosi, what is being dealt with at a very summary level?     What was your process or interaction with Mr Goosen?  What did the desktop study involve and all these memos?  What was the purpose of these communications?     He was what?  Worried.     Worried, yes?     Try and speak up a bit please and please …[intervenes]     What position does – is Mr Goosen still employed by Denel – by Armscor, I beg your pardon.     He left.     Okay.  Ja, just try and – if you can, just try and direct your answer to the specific question.  My question was not why he left but I said is he still there.     So no.     So he has resigned.  What position before he resigned did he occupy when you were dealing with him in these meetings and the memos that are referred to in your affidavit?     Okay.  And if I understood your evidence earlier correctly, but please correct me if I am wrong, these communications suggested to you that there were attempts to try and fix up a problem that had had already started as far back and 2005?     To ameliorate it?     Yes.     Try and keep your volume up please, Mr Nkosi.     Just like I am keeping my volume up.  Try and keep it up, sometimes you start loud and then you sink down.     Okay.  What position did he hold at the time?  You said programme manager.     Was he trying to fix up problems with the TP2 certificates or was he trying to get a TP3 certificate at that stage?     Without testing the vehicle?     Why do you say you think that is the case?     It is based on what?     Now legally is it possible to – sorry, in fact we have dealt with that.  Sorry, Chair, may I just rephrase it?  Has Denel in fact been manufacturing these vehicles without a TP3 certificate?     Now when it – and in fact your affidavit records also your confirmation now that Denel has been – has started manufacturing platform hulls.     You refer to DLS, is that Denel Land Systems?  Are they manufacturing the hulls?      You are not sure.     Thank you.  And as we sit or stand here today has there yet been a TP3 certificate issued for these vehicles?     And you refer – if I can take you in your affidavit to page 27.  Could you read for the Chair please your paragraph 14.6?  In fact, sorry, 14.5 to the end.     Yes, carry on?     Carry on?     And your last sentence?     Can you give just in a sentence maybe to the Chair your feeling as a citizen, as you put it earlier, and as a highly qualified mechanical engineer responsible for important issues in Armscor, can you just give you overall conclusion as to how you feel about this issue relating to the certification of these vehicles?     Just ask a final question on the same topic.  You suggested earlier that some of these changes or efforts that were being made, for example, the change in a certificate test number and in some of the efforts to re-programme things to see if they could achieve progress in relation to a certification.  From a practical point of view what – are there significant implications that would flow, if it were true, that people are manipulating things, changing things inappropriately or is it just simply a question of paperwork and test number not really mattering?     Importance of a test.     Okay.     Right.  Chair, we have nothing further, thank you.     Thank you, Chair, may we now turn to call, with your leave, the next witness?     Who is Mr Mlipha.  Do you want to take a short adjournment while…?     Thank you, Chair.    Thank you, yes we are Chair.     So with your leave may we call as the next witness Mr Xolani Mlipha, for the transcribers’ benefit it is M-l-i-p-h-a, may he then be sworn in?    Chair it is Denel Bundle 02 and it is Exhibit W12.     Yes that has been resolved Chair, I have explained the position to the witness and ...[intervenes]      He understands the situation and will proceed, thank you Chair.     Good afternoon Mr Mlipha.     Mr Mlipha may I just ask you to look towards the Chair, rather than me, even though I am going to be putting most of the questions and try and keep up the volume of your voice and try to be clear and very brief if you may.     Thank you.  May I just for the record confirm with you is it correct that you have signed an affidavit at the request of the Commission?     May I take you in the bundle that is in front of you, that is Denel Bundle 02, Exhibit W12, there is a statement, it is called a statement, if I may ask you to look at the top left hand corner of each page for the page number, you see that.     The page number on the first page of your statement ends in the digits 004.     But we are not going to use the zeros, we will just call it four.     You confirm that this is the beginning of the affidavit that you signed?     Can you turn to page 42.     Is that your signature above your name?     And you signed that on the 16 t h of October in front of a Commissioner of Oaths.     Is it correct that you have been through this affidavit and you are satisfied that the contents are true and correct?     Thank you.  Chair may we then ask formally for the admission of this affidavit with its annexures, Denel Bundle 02, Exhibit W12 the affidavit of Mr Mlipha.    Thank you Chair, may I then proceed?     Thank you.  Mr Mlipha your affidavit is very helpful in that it gives a lot of clarity and detail, I am going to try in the interests of time and also to avoid unnecessary reference to detail to focus just on particular areas with the Chair ’s leave and subject to his guidance may I take the witness just very briefly through his background.     His professional background and his employment background.     Thank you Chair.   Mr Mlipha you are a mechanical engineer by profession?     You hold as I understand a national diploma in mechanical engineering.     And you originally worked for Naschem.     And Naschem from there you moved to DLS to Denel Land Systems.     When was that that you moved to DLS?     Right, and how long did you stay there?     And where did you go from there?     And is that still your current employer?     So you joined when, in January 09?    And what is your current job title at Armscor?      When you were still at DLS between 04 and 2008 did any of your duties and functions involve the Hoefyster project?     Just in a sentence or two please just be very brief, explain what sort of role you played in relation to the Hoefyster Project.     Am I right in assuming that the ammunition segment is different from the hull element of these vehicles?     Were you part of the negotiating team from Denel in relation to the contract for the project Hoefyster being signed in 2007?     Okay, now just tell us what in very brief terms your role at Armscor now in your current capacity?     And this is the contract that was awarded by Armscor to Denel in what year?     Now in your affidavit you refer, and here Chair may I just refer to the page number, in your affidavit Mr Mlipha you deal at page 12 with two stages, two phases rather for the Hoefyster Project, or Hoefyster Contract I beg your pardon.     12.     And you distinguish between two phases, you say that the Hoefyster contract was divided into two phases, the development phase and the production phase, just in non-technical terms if you are able to just explain briefly the difference between the two, what is the development phase?      And the second phase?      Is the production phase, what stage is the project at, at the moment?     And what is required to achieve that baseline still?     That’s a PDM?     PBL, I beg your pardon, now PBL is that specified anywhere as to what it requires?      And where would one find that being specified?     Right, if I can take you in your affidavit to page 16, one six.     You refer in paragraph 11 to products baseline, is that the PBL concept that you were referring to earlier?     Won’t you please read out to the Chair what you say in paragraph 11.1?     Sorry, we are page 19, paragraph 11.     It follows the first line of paragraph 11.     Thank you.   Now the – am I right in understanding that the product baseline, the PBL, is just one of various baselines that have to be satisfied, if we look on the same page above the product baseline there’s paragraph 10, there’s allocated baseline.     And then below paragraph 11 you will see 12, manufacturing baseline.     If we page backwards take one page back, we will see also that there are two other baselines, paragraph 8, a requirements baseline an RBL, and a functional baseline, FBL.     And you have helpfully explained what each of these terms means.   Now may I take you again – I am sorry Chair – yes page 14, paragraph 5, it deals with the systems acquisition management process     SANDF in this context – correct me if I’m wrong – I understand is the customer in the – ultimate customer in the Hoefyster Project?     So it is Armscor ’s customer, correct?     But you are in turn procuring these items from Denel?     But the SANDF lays down a DAP1000 policy, being their standard.   How is that used, what is that meant to achieve and how is that used?     Right, and you then set out some detail about milestones, phases and then you get the project baselines.   We are going to be looking specifically again in a moment at the product baseline, the PBL element  that is one of these various baselines, is that regulated by  the SANDF DAP1000 policy?     Is that referred to in your paragraph 5.1 page 14?     So am I right in understand there are – there is a policy together with other standards and they include the Standard 3, the RSA military standard 3 that you referred to?     Right, I interrupted you, and how does the PDL, does that relate to the standard, Mil Standard 3 standard or what?    Right.  Now I would like to go back to the idea of the PBL and you – take you to page 20 of your affidavit.     Paragraph 15 is headed DLS’s tailored system acquisition management process leading to increased risk for Armscor.   Now before we get to the risk for Armscor can you just explain to us please what the tailored element is of this.  Who tailored what and why?     Just give us that again, what PB?    PBLA?      Right, and what does that stand for?     I did yes thank you Chair.     And the A, so it is the same PBL we were talking about earlier?     Okay, now ...[intervenes]      Now was a PBL specified by Armscor before it was tailored?     Yes, now the contractor with whom you contracted at Armscor or our colleagues did is DLS?     Now is it normal and permissible for contractors to tailor a process relating to the PBL element?     And to what extent are contractors allowed to tailor these items such as a PBL, did they have to comply with minimum standards or can they – is the sky the limit in relation to how they can tailor?     So the PBL that is laid down in the Mil 3 specification is the standard generally applicable one but that may be tailored by a particular contractor from time to time?     And when a contractor such as DLS does tailor the PBL is that subject to approval by Armscor?     So a contractor is not at large to simply tailor unilaterally?     Sorry Chair if I may have a moment.  Now in relation to the Hoefyster project and the contract between Denel Land Systems and Armscor has there in fact been a tailoring that has been done?     And was that done with the permission of Armscor?     Can I take you in your affidavit if you can turn please to page 20.     You say in your affidavit, para 15.1    And that was part of the contract?     Now if I can continue in your      Now is the untailored version the PBL?     So is it the timing of those specific steps that have to be taken under the PBL?     Yes and that is the standard PBL not the one that was later introduced in Denel?     I think you mentioned earlier that the one that was tailored and produced the Denel specific variation was called PBL A?     Right.  So there are differences between the PBL 1 and PBL A?     Were they significant differences in your opinion?     And we will get in a moment to why you say that and the risks that you expand on in your affidavit but you have mentioned that both the PBL A and the PBL 1 were specified in the contract.     Now if there are differences between the PBL A and the PBL 1 which version did Denel, DLS have to comply with according to your understanding?     Sorry did you say earlier than?     So are you saying that there had compliance with PBL A once that was achieved only then could they then be complying with PBL 1 they had to go through both steps.     Yes, so the fact that there was a PBL A that initially had to be complied with before PBL 1 is of less significance to you at Armscor, you are concerned really with the PBL 1 as it was called?     Okay, now I would like to take you please, because we need you to explain his, page 20, paragraph 15.4.     This was my opinion at the time, I think it means it was my opinion at the time that the risk had significantly increased for Armscor as payments were linked on the yellow block deliverables whereas the hardware progress was lagging behind.  It is however no longer an opinion as the risk has indeed materialised in the sense that development was scheduled for five years ending in 2012, but it is currently 2020 and development is still not yet completed.    Can you just please explain that to us in practical, simple terms if you would.   You were indicating that, if I understand it, you were saying that by tailoring the PBL to PBL A introduced something which brought about risk, risk for whom, for Armscor or for DLS or for whom?     Did it introduce risk for the achievement of the Hoefyster Project itself?    Yes.    And in what sense did it – it change the timing for the – for the payment of particular items?  Was that brought about by the introduction of the PBLA?    If there had been – if it had simply been left at PBL1 rather than tailoring it to PBLA would that have improved the situation?    Right.      And do you believe that the issues that you have raised and are – will still raise in relation to the PBL tailoring has contributed to that?  Has that been one of the challenges or the reasons for the delay in completion of the project timeously?    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Nkosi you mentioned earlier that there was a risk for Armscor in relation to making payments at specific stages.  Am I right in understanding that you – that what you were saying was that there were changes brought about by PBLA which would have the potential that Armscor would have to pay for something before enough progress had been made or enough deliverables had been – had been delivered.  Is that and I may be oversimplifying it and I apologise if I am.  Is my understanding correct?    We will deal with an elaboration in a moment.  Has Armscor in fact – has the risk materialised?  In other words has Armscor in fact been paying what might be regarded as prematurely in that it is paying too much up front for something that still has to be delivered?    Yes.  And but Denel has benefitted from that?    Yes.  Now I would like you please in    Now just before – I am not going to take you through all of the individual example or instances that you give but just explain to us why would this delive – why would this increase the risk of delivering the Hoefyster Project itself?   Is it not just a question of Armscor is having to pay a bit early but if they get the items does it really matter?  The Hoefyster Project will still be delivered.  Or is it actually a more serious problem?    Now may I take you through some of the instances that you have identified in your affidavit?  On page 21 you set out reviews and audits paragraph 16 and you give us one of the instances 16.1.1. system requirements review.  Now just explain to us please what the purpose is of the system requirements review?    And you then refer in 16.1.1.2 to your having realised something as recently as 2018 DLS was developing the product to meet its badger development specification not the Armscor specification?    Right thank you.  Then if we may turn by way of another example to paragraph 16.2 page 25 to 26.    Physical Configuration Audit PCA.  Chair I am afraid there are – there is more and more acronyms that keep coming up but I suppose that is the modern way.    Just explain to us again in layman’s terms if you would – lay people’s terms PCA? MR    Now if I can take  you please Mr Mlipha to paragraph 16.2.2 just read out that paragraph please.    Now so DLS – DLS’s PCA’s are – have been done in an incorrect way.  Incorrect if we can go back to the idea of the PBL1 and the PBLA.    What has been adopted by the parties themselves not just Denel but Armscor as well by adopting the PBLA is Denel complying with PBLA in relation to the sequencing and planning and conducting of these PCA’s?    What I am really asking for is; is the problem that you identify in 16.2.2 the incorrect planning and sequencing of the PCA’s by Denel?  Is that attributable to the fact that the PBL was tailored to become PBLA or is this a separate problem?    Now you say in 16.2.3 the following   And who bears the cost of that?  Is it an unnecessary cost to Armscor or Denel or who?    And your annexures also bear out that you have sent various memoranda and emails and so forth?    Yes.  Have you reached a resolution within the organisation – within Armscor?    Who is that?    Erasmus?    Right.  But is it correct that you have not reached unanimity within Armscor?  There are different views.    Right.  I have skipped through a number of the other examples that you have given is there anything specific that you feel is of major importance that you would like to highlight to the Chair before we move off these examples?    The critical?    Yes.    Yes where do you deal with that here?    Is that 16.1.4 at the foot of page 22 going onto the next page?  Is that what you referring to page 22 to 23?    Right just explain to us what these critical design reviews involve?    Alright.  Then in paragraph 17 on page 27 to 28 you deal again with the PBLA not existing in the RSA-Mil standard 3.  You appear to here be referring to the point we have already dealt with that PBLA does not appear in the RSA-Mil standard 3 document but tailoring is permissible.  It was agreed to with Armscor.  Your problem though with the PBLA is that it has increased the technical, financial and other risks in relation to this project.  Is that right?    Right thank you.  I am going to just touch very briefly on paragraph 18 the training system.  What does this relate to?  You are referring in the text here to a training simulator just explain to the Chair why you have dealt with this in your affidavit?  What is the concern that you have raised here in relation to training simulators?    Okay thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Paragraph 19 is headed PBL has not been achieved.  Again I am not going to go into the detail of this.  Here are you referring to PBL1 or PBLA it is not ...[intervenes]      Paragraph 19, page ...[intervenes]      And you have set out your reasons for     Okay.  Now again, just briefly, could you sum up your evidence relating to paragraph 20 from the foot of page 32.   “Concessions and deviations used as a means of justifying non-compliance.” Who is non-complaint?     Now Mr Mlipha, may we then turn to paragraph 21?  That refers to industrialisation.  And industrialisation is particular stage.  Is that correct?  Once development test and evaluation has been successfully completed.     Yes.     The phase?     Thank you for the correction.     Now is there a problem in relation to this aspect of the Hoefyster Project and the relationship between Armscor and Denel?     Yes, thank you.  So in relation to industrialisation, is there an issue currently between Armscor and Denel as to industrialisation?     May I ask you now please Mr Mlipha to look at paragraph 22 which refers to the manufacturing baseline.       Is manufacturing baseline different from the concept of the industrialisation phase or are they the same?     And you refer in paragraph 22.2 to a criticism that make you of DLS.   “It is establishing two baselines at the same time, termed hitting two birds with one stone.” Which of the two baselines?  The manufacturing baseline and what else?     And were they suggesting that the two should happen at the same time?     Have already been achieved?     And you then... your paragraph 22.4 says to this date, the project has not reached the PDL, let alone the MBL.       And you say that the MBL must come after the PDL?     Okay.  Now I would like, if I may, to deal to just touch on the next paragraph, the Patria vehicle selection.  You have referred in some of your paragraphs here to the testing and deficiencies and shortcomings in relation to the Patria vehicle not passing the Landmine Protection Hull Tests in the year 2005.  You were not involved or were you?     Yes.  And the Chair has already heard evidence earlier today from Mr Nkosi in relation to that.  Is there anything specifically that you want to raise that you believe is particularly significant for the Chair to know, bearing in mind that he will have the opportunity to read all the detail of your affidavit in this regard? MR     Thank you, Mr Mlipha.  May I just touch on one final aspect before we end our questions of you.  Can you turn please to page 408?     Do you have that?     This is headed with the Armscor logo and the heading is Functional Configuration Audit Report, Project Hoefyster.  And under summary, the heading     And if I might just draw your attention to a couple of passages.  Page 416.     Yes.     Just before we look at the text that appears there.  What was the... what is the purpose of the document and basically, what were you trying to achieve in undertaking this audit and setting out the report?     Thank you for that.  I just want to take you to two brief references in that body of your report.  Page 416.       Yes.  Half or two thirds way down the page, your report says Appendix A contains detailed breakdown of the score by Tables 1, 2 and 3.  4.1.1.1 – Observation. “Development was conducted against an updated batch of development specification which was no longer in line with the contracted development specification, SU3.  Corrective action, DLS was advised to reflect their development against the contracted batch of development specification.   3.  Observation.  Most deviations were requested after DLS had failed to meet requirements implying that these deviations were applied for after the fact.” Is this the reference to your earlier evidence in this regard?     And then the other examples I would just like to take you to.  Page 417, the next page, non-compliance.       You refer there to catastrophic.  And did you make any findings in your audit report as to whether there were any catastrophic non-compliances on the part of Denel and DLS in particular?     Thank you, Chair.  A final question from, if I may Mr Mlipha?  What has happened to this audit report that you have prepared?     Thank you, Chair.  We have completed the questions we wish to put to this witness.       Chair, we are at a stage now.  It is quarter to five.  We do not have another witness immediately available.       We initially planned in the original schedule to have somebody to follow today.     But there has been an issue which I would like to raise with you in chambers.     In relation to some logistical problems.     May we put you on that score?     And then ask in the meantime that we adjourn for the hearing to resume tomorrow?     We have scheduled three witnesses tomorrow.  Would it be perhaps...  I cannot remember Chair if you indicated the starting at ten o’clock would be a problem for you tomorrow because ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.     At ten.     Yes.     On Friday?     Yes.     Yes.     Certainly, Chair.  On tomorrow’s situation, if you – I know you have other commitments and challenges later in the afternoon.     And there are other counsel involved as well, I know.     We are amenable, if it suits you, Chair, to start early tomorrow perhaps at nine o’clock if that suits you and that may give a bit more flexibility for your other commitments but we are in your hands.     Okay.     Thank you, Chair.     Mr Drevin, he is a programme manager of DLS.  Mr van den Heever, also from DLS, Production Planner, and Ms Carene Geldenhuys who was at the time – she was still employed there, she has left, she was then the DVS Legal and Commercial Executive.  So they will deal with specific aspects of the DLS or the DVS procurement processes.     Thank you, Chair. 
MR MLAMBO:  That is correct Chair.    I do not believe that the decision that was taken was actually a solution to the problem.  My view was that the business was supposed to go to LMT.  I could not think of any sensible reason or sound reason as to why the business had to be given to VR Laser. Because that was going to have an adverse impact on our financials as a group and my view was that as one of the Group Executives I had the responsibility to contribute towards the success or profitability of Denel. And taking business away from Denel did not contribute to that objective.    I am assuming that..    The solution would be in his view that I had actually found common grounds with the CEO of Denel Land Systems and my other colleagues at Corporate Office.  And to me that does not constitute a sound solution.    I actually do not know.    Yes I am speculating.    Ja.    No I should actually have been confronted with alternatives.  I believe in robust basis there are challenges.    And if I am convinced that they are putting on the table sound solutions then I would actually retract my position and then accept what I think is in the interest of the business.    No-one ever came to me Chair.    Yes I have found 793.    Yes indeed it is.    Yes it is Chair my signature.    No it is not.  It is Mr Wessels initials.    That is correct.    Mr Wessels actually approached me based on the feedback I had given to the Executive team of DLS and my colleagues at Corporate Office.  And he believed that we could actually find an amicable solution to the problem.  And we discussed the issue…    To the problem of awarding the business to VR Laser.    Yes it was a response to that email and others before that very email.  And we had a meeting the three us.  Mr Mhlontlo, Mr Wessels and myself we looked at the merits of the decision and also spoke about the flaws in the process.  And in the end they concurred with me that yes it was definitely in the interest of Denel to give the business to LMT which is what this position paper is actually saying.  But it is also looking beyond just that opportunity that we talking about right now.    Huh-uh.    793 Chair.    The bullet – first two bullet lines.    Oh. “LMT is a Denel subsidiary.  51% owned by Denel and 30% owned by Pamodzi a fully black owned company. Denel has management control that also means management accountability for LMT.”    It certainly was the reasons and in fact the mere fact that we were persuaded as I pointed out that I was a member of the DLS board.  We were persuaded to acquire LMT – because it was a strategic company especially insofar as the execution of the Hoefyster contract I was concerned.  So it just did not make sense to me that all of sudden we must deviate from that position.    That is correct.    Ja there were some management issues but they did not all emanate from LMT.  Someone actually did an assessment of the problems and they identified that the problems were in both DLS and LMT.  There were some lapses in governance which I believed we could address as Denel with that management accountability.  And we worked on that and I saw some improvement because I was in constant contact with the CEO of LMT Doctor Stephan Nel.    Yes indeed.    Let me just correct one thing.  The author of the document was Mr Wessels and I gave my inputs and so did Mr Mhlontlo.  And this recommendation was actually supposed to go to the Group CEO so he could actually apply his mind and see if he could persuade the CEO of Denel Land Systems to reverse his decision.    Well Mr Wessels had committed to present – to present it to him.  I am not aware whether he presented it or not.    No we never actually had any discussions on this issue with Mr Saloojee.    It effectively meant that the work was going to be given to LMT a subsidiary of Denel which would have made me happy.    Well I assumed that because I had the support of two key executives the Group COO and Group FD that Mr Saloojee would actually have no choice but to accommodate this proposal.    I was actually shocked to learn a few months later that the business or the contract on the Platform hulls had actually been approved on the 16 October which was the following month and awarded to VR Laser.  That was without my knowledge.      No in fact the award to VR Laser was actually kept a secret because it was a few months later that I became aware of that.  And that boggles the mind because as a group you know supply chain executives had given the quantum of this contract I should actually have known about it.  And initially this was above R200 million and I would have been required to present in support of Mr Saloojee the proposal to the board.  Because anything above R200 million had to be presented to the board.    Yes I do.    This is a submission or do not know- Supply Chain submission for the approval of the Platform hulls.    Yes it is Chair.    Well the outcome of this document is that approval was granted to give the contract to VR Laser for the manufacture of 183 Platform hulls.  But what is actually notable here is that I was deliberately left out because of my position and in – in terms of the Delegation of Authority I was actually supposed to be the one that approving before the Group CEO could sign.    Mr –     It is correct Chair.    Ja it is true because I learnt late after discovering that this contract had been awarded to VR Laser.  But there was a meeting as you can see all the dates – all the dates are on the same day the 16 t h.    Yes.  So there was a meeting – the reason why I was not invited to that meeting baffles me.    Indeed.    Yes that is correct Chair.    That is my understanding. I am not aware that this approval was presented to the board.    Which was initially over R200 million.    No what was actually agreed was that LMT in addition to the hulls would actually be given the contract to manufacture the doors as well – the rear doors.    No, no the doors were actually a separate contract altogether.    There was ample capacity at LMT and if there were any production related issues and governance issues it was our responsibility as the executive team of Denel to address those without having to take the business away from the LMT.    Yes I was actually not prepared to compromise.  In instances where there was capability and capacity within any of the group divisions of subsidiaries there was no question about going out on tender.  And it was also quite explicit in the group Supply Chain Policy.  I think that is quoted in other parts of this evidence.      No certainly not.  Basically that would also mean that we would have to go back and amend the Group Supply Chain Policy to say there are instances when even if we have the capability and capacity we could actually outsource the work.  And that effectively means from a governance point of view – because if you amend the policy it has to be presented to the board that the board would have to approve that.  And it is a long process.  And I saw no reason why we should even debate the issue about giving work a group division or subsidiary.  To me it is just common sense.  It must be done.    711.     This paragraph ...[intervenes]      Ja, in my case, as board... former board member of DLS, Mr Burger himself is the one himself that presented the proposal that Denel must seriously consider acquiring LMT.   LMT has got those strategy capabilities that Denel needs particular insofar as the execution of the Hoefyster contract was concerned. He actually went on to say without LMT, Denel would have serious challenges executing the Hoefyster contract.  So that was his presentation.   So he is about ten – it actually horrified me and I thought something was actually amiss.  There is something that just did not make sense in what he suddenly decided to pursue.     That is Mr Burger.     H’m.     Yes, that is true.  Although, I was horrified by the content of some of those emails but when I thought about the ones they had actually exchanged with me, it actually made sense because it was the same line of reasoning. They were engaging, Ms Malahlela on the process whilst it was still on to establish where the process was and what the prospects were of VR Laser getting the business. And also, one of the comments that Mr Burger raised in one of the emails was whether the inputs from Patria which had actually conducted an onsite assessment of the three companies, was incorporated into the evaluation process. In fact, Ms Malahlela should have said to Mr Burger at     Eight, zero...  Yes.     Yes.     This is one of the sets of minutes that confirms that Mr Burger was actually extremely supportive and very enthusiastic about Denel acquiring LMT.  So it is one of those sets of minutes that confirms my position. It is unfortunate that the others with actually more specific details that we could not get hold of because I have already left Denel.     That is part 6 of the minute.     809.  That is right.     And also selling a stake to Kamozi.     At the time a black owned company.     Well, one of the critical strategic points that we were looking at, was that LMT had the capability to design vehicles, which in our case was not that much work.  So that was a plus.   And the other capability was that LMT could actually manufacture and assemble vehicles.  And Platform House actually make up part of that pool of products that LMT could manufacture.     Yes, it was actually critical to have that capability for Denel but because we were only looking at future opportunities offshore at the time.  And LMT was well-placed to actually help us access those opportunities.   When we applied LMT, it already had contracts in the Middle East.  And we actually felt that the Middle East was a growing market for Denel and that was priorities for us but we needed to have all the critical capabilities to be able to take advantage of that market.     Yes.     Well, I was concerned that despite the fact that each time I receive any correspondence from DLS, there was this reference to a hundred percent black owned company, 25.1% black woman owned company but I did not have any evidence.   When I requested evidence, initially what I was told was that Elgasolve owned 74.9% of the VR Laser and Craig Shaw Investment owned 25.1% of VR Laser. And the presupposed that 25.1% was black woman owned.  I wanted to know exactly who that individual black woman was but to this day, I never got an answer. The only answer that I received was that, Salim Essa owned the 74.9%.  And my instruction to DLS Supply Chain Team was that we should desist from using terms that are actually misleading or that are totally unfounded. When you say a company is black owned, you must have evidence that it is indeed black owned.     822.  Yes?     H’m.     Yes, and that is why, yesterday when I was asked a question about the conflict of interest that I had referred to in one of my emails.  DLS was actually of the view that because they had received these two declarations that, you know, the problem had been solved.   And I had said but there is no mention of all the directors of VR Laser.  Even on the document that they had accepted which was supposed to be a valid CIPC document and it was not.  They believed that that was correct.       Telling me about entities ...[intervenes]      ...when my question was quite explicit that I wanted to know the individuals behind that shareholding.     One, one...     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is the one.      No, certainly not.  I did not want to know the corporate shareholders.  I wanted the individuals.  Because BBBEE’s certificates actually base their assessment on the individual shareholder.   You have to unpack that.  You cannot simply accept that Westdawn is hundred percent black owned when you do not have that evidence.     H’m.     Ja, it is because that I saw.     Page 816 Chair.     No, I actually never received any response.     Ja.  I think it was actually putting him in a bind at the time.  He realised that he could not disclose.  There were some serious issues, I suspected.  Because under normal circumstances, this type of information is readily available.   And that begs the question as to whether the verification urgency that declared VR Laser as hundred percent black owned, actually saw the evidence.     Ja.     I was actually tempted to write to the Accreditation Board ...[intervenes]      ...to actually interrogate that.     To say you have the right to exercise that oversight over the performance of these accredited verification urgencies.     [No audible reply]      H’m.     [No audible reply]      That is correct.     Yes, that is correct.     JP was... or Mr Aurora.     Page?     818.  Yes, yes, yes.  Ja, that is correct.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, it is correct Chair.     That is correct, Chair. ADV KENNEDY     Ja.     No, I was not.  I was totally in the dark at the time.     Well, my reference to the end of the financial year has got this significance.  Each division is actually evaluated on its progress towards increasing the number of black owned companies in its supplier base. So a deal as we still had VR Laser that was listed as hundred percent.  There is other correspondence that... similar correspondence that I sent to other companies when I was actually in doubt about the correctness of what they had stated as the black ownership. So that would actually distort the report if at all DLS would claim that since the beginning of the financial year, they have actually increased their black owned suppliers by this percentage, if at all that was not verified. So I needed to be sure that whatever company that was listed as black owned was indeed black owned so that I could actually give grade where it was due. Because there was this ill fate competition amongst divisions that are actually liked(?).  And then I would obviously shower those that were doing well without compromising on quality, of course, in terms of increasing their black supplier base. Especially, insofar as the core business of Denel was concerned because typically what you find in South Africa is that most black owned companies are actually suppliers that on the peripheral of the business.  They provide doing services, catering.   My focus was on the core business of Denel and VR Laser happened to be in that pool of suppliers.       [No audible reply]      801?     That table?     Yes, yes, yes, that is correct.     That is correct, Chair.     It was critical because one of the elements that we looked at was ownership.     And then also the profile of employees and their skills development, how much the company was actually spending on the training and development of black employees and then procurement from black owned companies.  Those are the four critical categories or elements that we looked at that time.     Page 24, okay.     Yes.     Yes it is, indeed.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct. ADV KENNEDY     Yes, I did, Chair.     I was actually being asked to approve the single source status of VR Laser to essentially supply 00.04.10 parts and steel components to VR Laser and this was not just limited to – I beg your pardon, to deal as – this was not just limited the Hoefyster contract, that essentially meant that if at all they had any fabrication requirements or steel component requirements they would go to VR Laser.     That is correct.     It is a hundred percent Denel-owned company.  We acquired DVS from DAE Systems.     H’m.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, the focus at group level was policy and divisions could actually customise their processes to be aligned with a policy.     That is correct.  This is actually a quote verbatim from the group supply chain policy.     Ja, that is precisely, yes.     Yes, that is correct, Chair.     Ja, that is correct.     Yes, that is actually the gist of the request, for me to approve the deviation from policy knowing full well that there is capability and capacity within the group which I thought was ridiculous.     Yes.     Ja, that is correct and if in-house we did not have enough capacity, you could have such instances and to avoid a programme slipping and with the risk of having to pay penalties, sometimes it would make sense to outsource part of the work to an external company but that must be properly motivated and that is the reason why I noted here that if DVS and LMT could furnish reasons as to why they cannot execute this work, I would approve the deviation but that never materialised.       That is correct, Chair.     It is my handwriting.     Yes, I needed to be convinced that they did not have the capacity and there was a risk that we could actually miss our delivery deadline which is a very serious thing in the defence industry.  If you miss your delivery milestones you could actually lose the entire profit on that contract because of that so you have to have sound programme management in place.     Ja, it is also one of those dodgy contracts that they entered into and to my surprise, at the time it was Zwelakhe Ntshepe who was the Group CEO, Mr Saloojee had already been suspended and he actually overturned my decision, as you can see his signature over the – without even consulting with me.     Yes, that is correct.     No, I rejected this, so it was actually Mr Ntshepe himself who wrote approved.     Yes, it is his handwriting and it is his signature.     He was the Group CEO at the time.     Chair, he was actually overturning my decision and approving the request.     Without even consulting with me.     So his loyalty was outside Denel.     That is correct, Sir.     Actually I cannot recall the date.     But I would imagine this was shortly after the 29 October 2015.     Yes, it is true, Chair, but they had actually added other products that they wanted me to approve, the fire compartment module and the outer shields were added here.     That is correct, that is correct.     Yes, Chair, that is true.     Yes, that is correct, Chair.     Yes, it is actually an instruction note from National Treasury. I am very much familiar with …[intervenes]     Yes, all Schedule 2 and 3 companies are bound by that.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes, I always made sure that if I rejected something I gave reasons in writing and those are the four reasons that I gave.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes.      Basically what I was saying, Chair, is that I am not going to entertain this because I was not party to the memorandum of agreement.  Those who entered into that agreement are the ones that must actually approve future transactions which were at any rate going to be irregular.     It is correct, I can read the rest of it.     “The paragraph in treasury regulations that has been cited in the motivation memo is relevant because it was not impractical to test the supply market.” This instruction note deals essentially with emergency procurement.  If emergency procurement you do not really have the luxury of getting quotes but in this particular instance it was actually quite possible.  Assuming that we did not have the capability within the group it was possible to go out and find a suitable supplier at a competitive rate.     Well, if there is a thunderstorm, it blows off the roof of a house and you actually need to protect the assets within the house you can actually justify going out to one service provider or roofing contractor to do the work because you cannot wait seven days or three weeks before you get the work done.  If life is actually threatened or your assets are actually threatened in the process you are justified in going to just one service provider but the expectation is that you must keep a record of that so that when you are audited you can prove beyond any doubt that indeed this was an emergency, you did not have valuables to wait for two weeks or three weeks before you could have the problem addressed.     Certainly not otherwise that would nullify the notion of going out on tender.     Because the very reason why we go out on tender is to actually establish who of the tenderers or bidders is the best in terms of the work that is required or the service that is required and the price, you know, to do the job.     I seem to recall it may well be in this – in my evidence that this was also overruled.     841, yes, that is Mr Ntshepe.     Overrule or overturning my decision.     That is correct.     To page 843?     Yes, I found it.       Yes, it is.     Mr Steyn was the Chief Executive Officer of DVS, Denel Vehicle Systems.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Mr Ntshepe, who was at the time the Group CEO, had instructed Mr Johan Steyn, CEO of DVS, to enter into a similar agreement with VR Laser and this is what Mr Steyn is describing as a surprising instruction.  DVS and LMT basically have very much similar capabilities and that is why in some of my rejection notes I mentioned the two companies as to why they are not being contracted to do the work instead of VR Laser.     At the time if it is – 2019 he was already …[intervenes]     2015 he was Acting then because Mr Saloojee was …[intervenes]     September 2015.     Ja and he was appointed as the Acting Group CEO.     Yes, Chair, I was actually approached about that and I actually rejected that proposal and I seem to recall that Mr Steyn had actually been told by Mr Ntshepe that you are reporting to me, you cannot take instructions from Mr Mlambo.  That is what Mr Steyn told me and he said to me what can I do?  I said do what is right for the business, I am not afraid of anyone.  He must confront me and let me know why he actually insists that you have to outsource work that you can do yourself because Mr Steyn actually pointed out that by outsourcing that work, that was actually going to cost him about 15% more to do that and it just did not make sense and I said to him then do what is right.  I have made it very clear, it is in writing, I am rejecting that, you are not going to outsource that.  But then he is the Group CEO and he felt that he had all the rights to overturn my decision and he did just that to the detriment of the business.     Ja, there was – at that time there was surplus capacity at DVS which could not be utilised because the Group CEO, Mr Ntshepe that time, insisted that the work be outsourced to VR Laser.  So that definitely had an adverse impact on the financials of the group.     Yes, I do recall that.     That it was going to increase his costs by at least 15%.     15%.     That is correct and typically we do not even make that kind of profit in the defence industry.  If you make 7% it is an excellent net profit on a contract.     Yes.     Yes, Chair, it was very serious.  That is why I believe that even if he actually told Mr Ntshepe that he was not going to do it, if he got fired or disciplined he would still have his integrity intact.  In fact he would later be proved right, that he was acting in the interests of the group.     722.  Yes, I found it.     DVS.     Unfortunately I do not have it but I had actually requested the investigators to request that document and the unfortunate thing is that I have already left Denel and I could not have access to the documents that I had received.     I am not aware that it was awarded, but it is highly likely that it was awarded, because just like with the others they were awarded without my knowledge thereof.     No, I do not.     Well Denel entered into a contract with the Chad government, had to supply 40 vesper vehicles at a cost of I think around $18.2million.  What I know about the contract is that Mr  Ntshepe is the one that approved the contract but it was later mentioned in one of the EXCO meetings that the approval of that contract was detrimental to Denel because it was actually below cost and it was going to cost Denel money and there was also an issue of what we normally refer to as a technical advisor that had actually been paid but there was no evidence that the technical advisor had actually done any work for Denel.   And Denel had already been committed to deliver those 40 vehicles and what turned out was that the IP which is something that really surprised me in the motivation it was mentioned that…[intervene]     The IP for the Casper vehicles belongs to VR Laser.     Intellectual property, that’s right.     I was told that it belongs to VR Laser and for that reason I was requested to approve giving the work once again to VR Laser to manufacture the 40 Casper vehicles.  I rejected that request on the grounds that I was convinced that the intellectual property belonged to Denel and no one could actually furnish any sound reasons as to why it was now in the hands of VR Laser.  I requested proof that Denel had actually followed a due process to sell the IP to VR Laser and in my view that would have been well documented if that had happened and I also wanted to know what were the reasons or what was the rationale behind selling the IP when there were lots of opportunities for Denel to supply Casper vehicles not just to Chad but to other countries.   And all I got was that yes it was but no proof to authenticate that yes we had sold that and one of the things that was said in the motivation was that VR Laser had undertaken at its own cost to actually make improvements to the Casper vehicles and it was for that reason that you know they ended up owning the intellectual property.   And my question was how could they do that without an order from Denel because under normal circumstances when you place an order on a company to improve a product you’ve paid for that improvement the IP remains yours so I did not understand why in this particular instance the IP ended up in the hands of VR Laser.  So I rejected that request and in the process we learnt that VR Laser had been placed under business rescue and that actually forced us to look at our own internal capability and capacity and a decision was taken that we would do reversing the engineering in this case because we did not have the latest data pack because that if you do not have the IP you could not possibly have the latest data pack.  So that was the reason and DLS motivated that another company could actually supply some of the products because that is the chassis in particular.   The chassis had already been used successfully before according to the motivation from DLS and they submitted the letter to myself from a company called Sinotruk which is a Chinese company that letter confirmed that the accredited representative was a company known as ENNE7 and no one else could supply that chassis except that company and it was on the letterhead of Sinotruk.  And on the basis of that I actually approved the designation of ENNE7 as a single source supplier because there was evidence in this particular case.   And it later turned out that there was a Bowman’s report that had investigated the whole saga and found that amongst other things that were wrong that the so-called letter from Sinutruck was not authentic it was a fake letter and I had to face disciplinary action for having approved that and I went out of my way in fact once again after the event to verify the authenticity of that.  I wrote to the managing director of Sinutruck and sent a copy of that letter to him and asked him whether it was an authentic letter and he confirmed in writing that it was indeed an authentic letter.       Well I actually saw this as a ruse or as an excuse to get me out of the way because I was a difficult person I wasn’t towing the line and at that time the Group CEO was Mr Danny Du Toit because Mr  Ntshepe had already left.     And I actually thought that it had something to do with some previous disagreement also relating to the award of a contract to a company an auditing company that they actually believed had to be awarded that contract.  But the evaluation process did not support that and I rejected that and because I was now facing disciplinary action for having approved something that was authentic I requested a copy of that report from Bowman’s and to this day I never received that report, each time I got excuses.   There are a number of emails that I exchanged with Mr Du Toit and I never got that until I enlisted the services of an attorney Mr Fisher who challenged that, requested the documentation and that never happened and Denel actually backtracked after that.     Ja, precisely Chair.     That is correct Chair.     No, I was never dismissed.     No.     What happened I actually decided to leave the company because I thought the situation was such that I could not continue working for Denel I applied for a VSP, voluntary severance package.     It was actually approved but after the mention of that Bowman’s report I was told that it was going to be suspended pending the outcome of the disciplinary hearing. But when I sit back and thought about the circumstances that led to that it was blatantly clear as we will discuss that or we will present evidence later that my refusal to approve the appointment of Ernst & Young actually triggered that because I based my decision on the evaluation teams report in this course.  I interrogated that and I was satisfied that they were objective, impartial, fair and they did things in accordance with the requirements of the policy.       That is correct Chair.      Ja, Ernst & Young was not the winning bidder.  The winning bidder…[intervene]     Ja, but Kopano was actually second on the list I do not know where the evaluation report is here it is one of the annexures.      That is correct Chair.      In 2019.      Well it was actually sad because I had actually invested a lot of time and energy in making sure that together obviously with people who believed in the future of Denel to make sure that Denel is a viable and successful organisation.  When I joined Denel I joined one of the divisions which was at the time the biggest division in the group that was known as Kentron but it was later renamed Denel Dynamics.   I did quite a lot, Denel was lost making that time it was in a dire state.  My key role at that time was to implement a management systems to comply with the relevant ISO standard, ISO of 9001, 14 001 and 18 001 and there I managed to get Denel Dynamics which was the biggest division at the time to be ISO 9000 and 14 000 accredited because one of our biggest clients at the time which was Armscor it is not one to do business with companies that are not ISO certified.  And the next big project that I handled was running with development and implementation of the strategy that we dubbed voyage to excellent.  And at that time Mr Wessel’s was actually the CEO of Denel Dynamics and very supportive I think he did a sterling job at that time supported me and even got me to actually be part of the team that approved the appointment of key individuals in the group with a view to driving a transformation because as a high-tech organisation we employed a lot of engineers and scientist at Denel.  And we managed through the right interventions to get a lot of black engineers into the group and in that period the division was actually doing well people were very motivated and it was regarded as strategic.  In fact, they used the term sovereign, sovereign capability which is above strategic status because there is no other company on the entire continent that has got the capability to develop missiles and UAV’s and Denel Dynamics had that and in the southern hemisphere as well it was the only one that could do that.   So we were very proud of what we have achieved and the company started doing well financially and you know the group and with the appointment of Mr Riaz Saloogee the company did even better.  I think it was during his era that Denel did exceptionally well and it was showed quite constantly with the label of the best governed SOE because we had good governance, we were just doing well.  Our processes were great and then it was actually sad to see Denel in the State it was in being unable to pay salaries most of the time, depending on tenders and we were losing a lot of critical skills because the focus had been lost, we were not focusing on the things that actually make a business to hum.   So it was actually sad to, for me to see that happening but what I am hoping to see because I still believe Denel is a very strategic and critical business not just for the State but for the country.  It is important to find the right people in key positions that will turn the fortunes of Denel around.  I think it is still possible they can still get back some of those lost critical skills and just get people that will focus on the things that matter in a business.     My pleasure.     Thanks for giving me the opportunity.      Okay. 
MLAMBO:  Yes and that remained my position throughout.   Suspended in – I think it was …[intervenes]   The tender was actually for the appointment of an internal audit company.  After the evaluation as per our process the evaluation team presented their report.  I was actually quite happy with their report initially they had recommended that the company known as Nexia SAB&T something.  But it turned out that that company had actually not disclosed some contravention, it was guilty of issuing a BBBEE certificate that they were not supposed to issue and the BBBEE Commission was involved in that.  So that was a serious contravention and on the basis of the representation to myself by the acting group financial director and also in that report he mentioned the Chair of the audit committee Mr Taliep Sadick that he had actually expressed concerns that evaluation team had overlooked that.   I saw the evidence and on the basis of that evidence I concurred with him that yes it was the right thing to do to disqualify that company which I did.  And I said then we have to as per policy award the contract to the next best company it was Kopano and the argument that was raised after that was that they did not know Kopano it was the acting Group CFO was supported by the Group CEO and they actually claimed that even the head of the audit committee did not support the idea of Kopano being appointed because they did not know it and my argument was that you do not have to know the company.   After all the three companies are large companies and that pre-supposes that they have enough resources to execute the contract and if I look at the head count of the three companies there is no way that they would not be able to execute that contract and I said we do not actually appoint companies on the basis of who we know in those companies.  I look at the evaluation report and on the basis of that I approve or reject if I find that there is any anomaly in that report.  And then they raised another argument that the company in question was doing work for the Auditor General, I investigated that and even spoke to a senior manager in the Auditor General’s office and that senior manager confirmed that almost all the companies, audit firms that are in South Africa are doing work for the Auditor General and I said if that is the argument I am not going to entertain it.  The award will go to Kopano as per the outcome of the evaluation process that was rejected because the Group CEO and the Group CFO were supposed to also sign as approving that.   They rejected that and ultimately the contract was cancelled but one of the things that did not happen.  When you cancel a contract that was advertised on the eTender portal, the National Treasury’s portal you have to furnish reasons and post on that website as to why you are cancelling that tender that was not done.  But then unfortunately during that period that is the time when I left the company but a subsequently learnt that the tender was re-advertised and the outcome was in favour of Ernst & Young the company they wanted to appoint.   So it would be interesting for the evaluation process to be investigated and see whether a proper process was followed in awarding.  I do not think it is a coincidence that the contract ended up going to Ernst & Young that is what they wanted to do right at the outset.                     
MR NKOSI:  Oh I have – I am [Not speaking into microphone].    [Not speaking into microphone].    Phumlane Nkosi.    No.    Yes.    So help me God.    Correct.    Correct yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Yes correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Armscor.    I started in 2009.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    It is the current DVS Denel Vehicle System yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    From 2005 until 2009.    Correct.    I was a Program Manager at Armscor.    To a Team Leader.    Yes.    In Program Management Support.    Yes.    Yes. ADV KENNEDY    Yes.    Yes.  I am a blast specialist what was then referred to as a RSM new standard officer.  That entails basically ensuring that all the vehicles that go to the SANDF are properly tested and certified.    Correct.    Correct.    Basically before the vehicle can be issued to SANDF according to the RSM Mil standard that is a clearly specified – it has to be [intervention]    It is – it is the vehicle itself.    Yes.    Armoured vehicles yes.    Yes.    Correct.    SANDF.    Yes.    It is Armscor’s function to test that before it is given to the SANDF.    Armscor is ultimately responsible they are the National Authority.    I only became responsible from 2011.  The tests happened in 2005 as per CV has indicated that I was at CSIR at the time.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    In 2005 there were three tests that were done.    Yes.    Yes.    Frans Beetge is the – is the previous incumbent of the position that I am currently holding now.    Yes I replaced him.    Basically I was his understudy from 2011 basically getting all the background information for his work because it is a critical skill and a critical work as specified by Armscor and hence it is not a work that can be – you need time just to get a ground until you get acquainted with the work.    Yes.    Ja unfortunately he was ill – he could not carry on anymore I think he retired just before – before turning 65.  He must have been around 62.    So he felt he needs to spend enough time with his family.    Correct.    Yes he conveyed and provided all the evidence on all the tests that were done.    Yes I have documentation, I have videos, I have files and the pictures basically.    Yes.    Correct.    The standard’ s purpose is to ensure that the vehicle that ultimately goes to service by the SANDF has been properly tested as it involves basically those vehicles are subject – could be subjected to landmines in the area of operation.  So basically that – that standard lays down on all the processes that one has to follow until the vehicle can be issues to the SANDF.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes they are part of that.  There is also a TP1 a test plate 1 whereby it is just the preliminary stage of the whole process.    So – so basically they are part of that standard test.    TP1 test is basically a test plates that you still sort of like trying to find out scientific evidence or maybe the    Yes.    Correct.    A TP2 test basically it is the critical test whereby if there are bidders on a particular contract of supplying armoured vehicles.  It is an entry test whereby you actually trying to ensure that the vehicle that you are going to accept has a minimum structural integrity to be able to be considered for – for the contract.    Yes.  So basically the understanding is that the vehicle is not being properly developed yet because it is still a bidding phase.    Ja.    Correct.    Correct.    The TP3 test it is after you have basically had a confidence that the vehicle has the bare minimum requirements.  The TP3 test is the final test now whereby the design has been fully developed.  So it is – you can then test but having a TP2 test actually prevents an issue whereby you go to a TP3 and there are issues.  So the TP3 test is the final test basically.    The manufacturing base line has been reached.  Just before you begin to manufacture it has to pass a TP3 test.    Correct.    Yes.  The understanding is there is still some development issues that still have to be tackled but by and large you have – you have met the basic requirements.    Not according to the RSM-Mil standard. ADV KENNEDY    The consequences are quite severe.  One could    Correct.  If I may further elaborate.  Basically if you having all those tests you have evidence that you have done basically – all the necessary things just to ensure that the soldiers are safe.  For future legal ramifications if there could be loss of lives you know that you could actually refer them back to all those tests results and tests data that you obtained to show that you have actually done proper engineering judgment.    Three tests.    Yes basically I had to review the information and look at the data just to acquaint myself with the work as it was on-going at the time.    Yes basically there has been – there is evidence that tests were conducted for a TP2 test.    Yes.    Yes.    No it was not done.  It was not done.     Sorry.  Sorry, Chair.  Just water, please?     Water.     Yes.     Okay.  I will repeat again.  It is three tests that are conducted for TP2 tests, three tests.     There were two sets of tests that were done.  One done by the auspices of Armscor.  The other one done by LMT on their own accord.       With CSIR.     Yes.     The one that was conducted by Armscor.     Yes.     We conduct it together with CSIR as they are our technology partner but it is important for Armscor to be there so that they keep a record of the hull configuration amongst other things.     I am not sure about that but it is Armscor’s task as responsibility.  I am not sure as in terms of the statutory requirements.  But it is their... they are obliged to do so.       Yes.     Correct.     No, they would not have done that because at the time the baseline had not been finalised.  So it is a... it was just an entry test.       Basically, again, it is a entry test so that Armscor makes a due diligence to make sure that if some modifications are happening to like the baton(?), then you would have done max the bare minimum requirements.   The bare minimum requirements test, with the understanding that – because we wanted additional things on the hull.  There will be additional things that are still going to be finalised for the process, for the procurement of that.     Yes, I discussed with him the outcome of that.  And he basically told me everything that he had to.     Yes, that he had.     Ja, he informed me of everything else and all the intricacies that were involved in the projects and some of his misgivings as well.     Okay.       Okay.     Okay.     Correct, sir.     Let us start with the first test.  It is a wheel-short-test.  They passed the wheel-short-test.       Yes, there are different elements that those tests actually entail.     Ja, it depends on the complexity of the vehicle that is being tested.     Yes, it is a series of tests, basically.     Yes, h’m.     The overall outcome.  The first test, it was a wheel-short-test.  Generally, by enlarge, with my experience with the tests, the wheel-test generally passed because it shows you...   It sorts of like simulates one the ...[indistinct] that will hit a landmine with the front tyres or the rear tyres.  So basically because of the... it passes generally but the most important test that fail is the hull shot.     The hull shot.     Yes.  Basically, where the occupants sit at the back.     Ja.     Well ...[intervenes]      Basically, we get human readings on the...  We put a dummies.  From pics.  Just devices on that, the dummies.  And we basically get a threshold values with...  Threshold values from international literature and studies that have actually show that if it was a human who sits on that vehicle, if it is above a certain threshold, then they will either pass...  They will either die or being amputated, basically.  In just simple terms.  But the hull test failed because the readings were just a bit too high.     Yes.     Okay.     It depends.  When we...  That is why it is important for Armscor to be involved at the... on the test because we are an independent body with an interest of the SANDF at heart.  We look at the vehicle to see where... which area is likely to actually cause damage.  That is where we put the landmines, basically.  We look at the worst case scenario.       Yes, the drivers.       There is normally a driver and there is normally the crew commander.  There is people operating the vehicle as well.     And ...[intervenes]      It does not mean that they will be safe but we have to take the ...[intervenes]      Basically, we look... we could either put it at where the drivers are because the landmine can actually explode...  In actual sense, we should be testing all the areas where people are sitting, just to be sure.       Yes, basically, on this particular test, according to my predecessor, they actually intended to look at various critical positions because of the nature of the vehicle and the complexity of the vehicle.   Because we include the tarot as well where human lives sit as well.  But because we... it is just on the second test, it just failed the hull test.  But the intention was to look at other strategic positions within the vehicle to see if it passes or not.     Yes.     Yes.     Depending ...[intervenes]      If you are failing in one, it is enough.     because all the lives on the vehicle matters.     Only one is enough.  So it would mean that, basically, the potential bidder ...[intervenes]      ...will have to go back to... going back to the drawing board.     Go back to the tricky one and do simulations again and do their own test outside of our test before coming back to us again with confidence with the ...[indistinct], basically.     No, but ...[intervenes]      Yes, that is why it is important for Armscor to be the people who choose that because you do not want a situation whereby maybe potential... be it the particular area, knowing very well that you will be testing that.   So it is a decision by the national authority.  Armscor together with the CSIR would sit and look at the critical part within the specific vehicle.  At which point can they actually hit.     Yes, he discussed everything.  I saw the footage.  The beauty of it...  That is why if it is under the auspices of Armscor, we are... we have Armscor quality as well which is a critical division within our Armscor as well that that offers independent quality check of the vehicle.   You need to check the baseline of the vehicle, the drawings.  Sometimes actually you need to measure.  You need to measure the weight of the vehicle.  You need to go and take pictures of all the angels.   Wherever you can so that you can put it on your requisite for any possible ramification that had come after in years to show that you have done... you have taken pictures, you have done, you weighed the vehicle, this is the correct baseline and everything like that.       Yes.     15, 8.2.  Yes.       Basically, the vehicle was provided to us by LMT.  I guess maybe the relationship with Patria, that I am not party to ...[intervenes]      ... a sample was provided to us by LMT.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, it is basically, is that.  Just, if you look at 8.5, the test was actually classified as catastrophic.     Because there was fire(?) inside the vehicle.  The hull ruptured actually.     So it means that if it was a human being that was there, it would have been the end of their lives.     Yes.     255?     Where is the page?     255, where is the page?     I have... okay, 255.  Okay thank you.     255, okay.  Yes.     I just have to look at the document itself.  This is not the one here.  I think this is the second one that was done by CSIR.     That is the third test.     Yes.  This is the one that was requested by LMT on their own accord.     ....to by the CSIR.     Yes.     Let us be specific.  It is the third test because there are two tests that they ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Because they failed the Armscor test, LMT on their own accord.     Yes, on their own accord, they fixed the vehicle, basically.  They retro-fitted the vehicle that failed and they moved to the ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes.  They basically removed... they retro-fitted the vehicle.  They removed the part that was blown apart.  And apparently increased the thickness of the hull and went back to the CSIR to basically test the vehicle on their own accord without Armscor’s presence in terms of verifying the baseline, looking at the vehicle, taking the masses, as it is a requirement by the standard.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes, according to the standard, they have to involve Armscor because as we stand currently, Armscor does not even have the correct baseline of this particular vehicle that was tested.       Yes.     Yes, I do not know why... why was this... does LMT allow ...[indistinct] on the test.  Maybe it was before my time.  I am not sure about that.     Yes, yes, yes.     I am not sure on the contractual conditions but on the documents that I have seen on the critical criteria, on the documents that I have seen, it means that the company has actually failed.  They need to restart again or maybe the whole process to actually restart again.       Yes, the second test.  Unfortunate to have someone who was part of the rest, who was... he was a ...[indistinct] at the CSIR who was part of it.  They passed the test.       Not according to France and not according to the CSIR because they have provided them with the specimen that was not even documented or recorded or weighed or even established on the adequacy of that particular test item that was on the vehicle, to present it.   But with the CSIR, they have clearly stated that if you provide... if you bring the vehicle to them and say test, they would test scientifically and according to the RMS Standard.   But they are not sure on whatever thing that you provided because they did not really spend time with the vehicle, look at the data fact, what changes were made.   Because if it fails, like the Armscor test, they are supposed to go back to do the TSP1, provide the simulation results to show that now they are ready again to test, provide the engineering test which is what the second... the third test was supposed to be.   It is an engineering test just for them to get confidence again so that they can resume that they have actually failed.     Yes.     It was my predecessor.     Yes.     Yes, he actually raised so many concerns because from 2009 up to now, you could see that there was quite a lot of the movement because once they realised that this test was actually not correctly done according to like RMS Standards.   So they tried to apply it in all the hulls that are missing on that test so that it might look legitimate on an eye that does not delve on the details of it yet.     Yes, Chair.     No, no, no.  Basically, after realising the inadequacies of this particular test that passed, there was later attempts to try and legitimise the hull operation by doing other additional simulation tests, basically.     On the vehicle.     Yes, inadequacies.     Yes the ...[intervenes]      Basically, if you do the test, there are many components on the test.  You look at flying objects.  As you can...  If I can take you back to 8.4.2.  On the test ...[intervenes]      8.4.2.     Yes, basically, inside the vehicle, there are objects that once the vehicle is subjected to a landmine-test, they fly around.  Those are critical ...[intervenes]      They can never remain ...[intervenes]      ...or skewer the people inside the vehicle.     All those particular items were removed on that test.  Yes.     Yes.     They were not even tested.     Yes, they did some but not the others.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, basically ...[intervenes]      ...they requested them to test.     Yes, unfortunately, the certificate was issued by Armscor.     Yes.  How they did it, I do not know.     Correct.     No, they were actually invited as guests.     Yes, they were there as guests.     Not to oversight.  To actually see the whole process.  Because what normally happens before the test.  You actually go to the premises of the vehicle, the manufacturer, you... the exchanged document, the data packs.  You have sent the data packs.  You weigh the vehicle.  You take pictures just as evidence.  As evidence.  That is critical in the whole process.       Yes.     No, no.  They might have done it with the CSIR, I am not sure.     But Armscor,  currently ...[intervenes]      Armscor, currently, does not have that evidence.     What vehicle was actually tested.  Because on the CSIR report it was evident that basically what happened was.  They basically took the vehicle that was blown catastrophically and basically cut a section that was torn apart and retro-fitted a thicker... And took the vehicle back again to the test with the tarot baskets that have actually ...[indistinct] after the first test.  I am...  I wish, maybe, you could have actually be exposed to the pictures that actually happened on that test.     So you can see how catastrophically the test was.     So basically it was just ...[intervenes]      Cut and paste job, like...  Honestly, it was a cut and paste job.     I would not want to further describe it.     But it does not follow engineering principles.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.  Page 46, basically, before the tests were taken, LMT or Armscor rather.  Armscor requested CSIR...     Apologies.  Armscor requested the CSIR to do a theoretically evaluation of the specimen before the test that happened, the first two tests that happened.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      138, yes.     Yes.     This is the...  If I look at it, if you can look carefully, approved by...  It is important to have an Armscor signature there.  There is a ...[indistinct]  Unfortunately, this one is unsigned but I can actually get you a copy of the signed one.  This should be the tests results of the first two tests that actually happened that were under the auspices of Armscor.     Yes.     255, yes.     Third test.     Yes, that is an engineering test that was conducted by CSIR on behalf of LMT.  If you can look carefully on the signature page as well.  There is no Armscor involvement there.      If you look at page 256, yes.     Yes, as it is the case with the test that we... that was conducted with Armscor being there.     So we work with CSIR as our technology partner.     So that one would have a CSIR page as well.     The other one would...  Even if for...     You can have Armscor person there or not.     Depending on who requested the test.     Yes, it ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Not necessarily.    Not necessarily, but for the SANDF vehicles, Armscor signature has to be there.     Because Armscor quality, you have to [indistinct] 00.00.20 to take place, Armscor Quality having to oversee the process as well together with Armscor acquisition as well.     Yes.     In this instance.     Ja, I will have to be specific in this instance.     Because CSIR on their own - they do validate that on their own and then issue certificates.     Yes, my predecessor accepted it which is a decision that he actually regretted because if you can look on some of the annexures, CSIR as well, together with Frans Beetge, they had actually – it is Dr Izak Snyman and Dr Frans Beetge, they actually they wrote in their misgiving on the test that had actually happened but why did he sign the certificate I do not know because that certificate was a critical requirement in placing the contract, was a critical requirement in placing a contract if we have to put it on record.     Correct.     No, in principle he told me everything was  actually involved.  It is a matter of he says, she says, but basically the bottom line, whoever convinced him to sign I cannot divulge the names and things like that.  Basically he had promised that because the standard anyway still requires the TP3 test to be conducted.     He should not worry about that because there is field, it is mining phase whereby this vehicle will still be tested and his reasoning for signing was based on those assumptions.     Correct.     Correct.     For me if we were together I was not going to actually issue the certificate.     I would not have agreed to the certificate because there is a lot of omissions that were not done on that test.      I cannot say that.     Ja, it would have been – it would been tantamount to that.     But I do not know the reasons that actually compelled [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     On the fact of it …[intervenes]     It is not something that I would have done in his position.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, correct.     Ja.  It does not mean that necessarily that they have been given a go ahead that you are the heroes of the revolution.     Yes.     I am not sure.  Maybe they picked up there was an issue – there was an error in the certificate that was issued in 2005 that I was not party to.  Fortunately, one of the persons that still – that issued his signature is still there, he still alive, maybe he can answer to that question why.  But, my understanding, there was an error with the Casspir(?) report that was stamped on the certificate so they were trying to rectify that.     It is a certificate that is valid – valid …[intervenes]     Ja, valid forever, basically.     So one would ask himself because if you sign the certificate you need to have proper documents in front of you, would make sure that what appears on that certificate is genuine as according to like the test, so whatever reasons that they actually changed, I do not know.     Yes.     Correct.     Correct.     Okay.     I will tell you now if – the first one that was issued was the VO.  If you turn to page 304.     Yes, that is the chronology, you start with the VO.     Sorry, 303, 303, sorry.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No, no, no, the wheel test passed, the test that was conducted by Armscor.     It passed.     Yes, 303, that is the one that Armscor have all the necessary information.     It passed the wheel …[intervenes]     The other one had failed the hull test.     And subsequently they did an engineering test that Armscor converted to a TP2 test.     Yes basically – they basically reissued the same two certificates, 303 and 304.     So basically  303 now has been converted to 304, if you can page on the document.  There is the wheel test.     Ja.       And then the 302 has been – is the – ja.     There was no further test.     Yes.     I think the reason for reissuing this statement was apparently having to do – to correct the test number.   If you can look at the test number on page 303 and 304 they are different.  They are trying to align that for whatever reason.     If you look at the test number.     Alright, fine.     Correct..     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, exactly, so it was …[intervenes]     Yes, the test number was subsequently changed to reflect that one for whatever reason.  Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     I am specifically zooming at the test number, if you can …[intervenes]     The 159.  I am looking page 303.     Yes, I am on page 303 and 304 now.     302, correct.  Okay, ja.     Yes, they changed the test number.     It is 166, yes.     This is the wheel – this is the hull test, this is the hull test.     Okay.     If you look at page 303.     On the line test number.     Yes, it is DEF 2005/159.     Yes.     That is the change, yes.     No, it is not the change.  The change – if I may just take you baby steps.     Look at page 303 and page 304.     Yes.  Those are, if I may explain?     They are the same – they are the wheel tests.     Yes.  303 and 304 are the wheel tests.     Yes, that is the hull test.     That is the point that I was trying to make.     Yes.     As you can see there is change on that, it says – say it is a wheel, it is a front wheel, on 304 they changed the test number on that.     Ja.     Basically they were trying to realign for whatever reasons that I am – that I was not party to.     No, not.     No.     Yes.     Correct.     Correct.     Page number?     Yes, yes, yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Basically I believe once they realised that there were some flaws on the tests they tried to conduct other desktop studies and simulation studies to try and move away from conducting a TP3 test and actually classifying the vehicle has actually reached a manufacturing baseline. So from 2014 Mr Beetge came to me, he was absolutely worried now …[intervenes]     Worried.     Because there were rumours, there was a groundswell of evidence that there is manufacturings happening across the country for whatever reason but they have actually not reached the point whereby …[intervenes]     Yes, can you hear me now?     Yes, can you hear me now?  Yes, can you hear me?     Yes, can you hear me now?       Mr Beetge, whilst we still – I was still his understudy, he was actually worried with whatever is happening across the country when whereby there was a go-ahead being given to start building the hulls on the vehicle that has not been tested.   So he was worried now that you know what, looks like they are busy building the hulls but we have not tested – we have not certified the vehicle.   So that is why I was now busy writing the memo that Phillip, I still need the vehicle test before you can declare that reached the manufacturing base.  We have to test the vehicle.   So basically that was that because we tried to also introduce a simulation to show that the vehicle is – can be fit for people to use but the RSM was going to disappear, you cannot use simulations to certify.  So basically all the communications was to actually try to get the vehicle to Armscor to test be that is a phase that was – that has not been completed.  That, as an engineer, as a South African, I could not let that slide because it is our soldiers’ lives that are actually involved.  So that is why I was quite vociferous on that, that you cannot – not under my watch. It could have happened in 2005 whereby the TP2 had a lot of unanswered questions but on this specific one, because you will never know, it could my child who is actually on that vehicle and then I had given it a go-ahead without giving it a go-ahead.  So basically I – we fought, together with Frans Beetge because he realised that the tide now is actually moving towards the right before time. There was euphoria and excitement on the manufacturing before we had actually given the go-ahead that we have tested all the necessary points to now bless the manufacturing [indistinct – dropping voice]     Yes, the role now it will be Phumlane Nkosi’s name that had actually led such is a critical requirement on the RSMA standard to be ignored so I could not allow that, together with Armscor. Armscor with my divisional manager, we started writing memos.     To test the vehicle.     Because testing the vehicle cost a fraction of the entire contract, it was – it is the right thing to do, so that we know we have done due diligence as Armscor employees, as engineers, as South Africans.     No, no, no, I think throughout these interactions I think somehow he decided to leave the employ.     Ja, he left the company I think towards the end of 2017 for whatever reasons, I do not know.     Yes.     Correct.     He was the programme manager for the programme [indistinct – dropping voice]     Yes, they busy trying to ameliorate that.     Yes.     But putting things that are not scientifically proven to actually provide safety for the soldiers.     Yes.     That is fine, I will do that.     Okay, can you put that question again?     Correct.     I think he was trying to get a TP3 certificate at that stage without actually testing the vehicle.     Correct.     It is my opinion because they were …[intervenes]     It is based on what has been happening on Denel when there was apparently manufacturing baseline that has been reached that we are not familiar to.     My involvement is largely on the landmine protection.  If I may just answer it like that.  There has not been any TP3 test that has been done.  So you are correct that Denel has been manufacturing vehicles without a TP3 test.     Yes, I will be going too far, I am not sure.     Yes, I am not sure.     Yes.     Yes.     That is what I heard, yes.  That is what actually spurred Fran Beetge to tell me that you know what, you cannot let this thing to happen because I am just about to retire, it cannot be – they are not supposed to be manufacturing the hull at this point before we actually give them a go-ahead by testing the vehicle, by certifying the vehicle to [indistinct – dropping voice] ADV KENNEDY     Basically there was a groundswell of evidence that …[intervenes] ADV KENNEDY     I am not sure.     Ja.     Nope.     “In short, TP3 test is a fundamental test, it is  fundamental to test and evaluate all design changes implemented since the structural TP2 platform tests and to assess secondary fragmentation risks and reparability.”     The RSMA standard TP3 test on the section  variant would address the critical aspects of evaluating the assessed worst case scenario for occupant survivability of the Hoefyster family of vehicles in order to secure the best results for the SANDF and the future users and operators of the Badger systems.  Lastly, it will ensure compliance with this RSMA standard as required by the SANDF.”     “A TP3 test which was not addressed on the  system specification document, Armscor has committed that they will allocate funds in order to conducts these tests.  In November 2013 Denel committed in complying with the request to conduct TP3 testing on this vehicle.”     Yes. “I am aware that Denel has started a manufacture platform hulls despite the fact that the vehicles have not been certified in the TP3 test.”     Yes, for me the results of the fight that started on the memos on 2005 culminated in paragraph 14.7 where Denel with the assistance of DVS Vehicles Systems they acknowledged the importance of this test and they had actually put a plan in place to make sure that this vehicle is actually tested but now the question remains, with all these hulls that have been manufactured, what will happen if the vehicle fails?  But if it passes then everyone is happy and there will not be issues but it is important to actually test. As a South African holding this position that I am holding, I would not have allowed this thing to slide without proper tests being conducted. Let alone whatever happened in 2005 with the TP2 test which was – it is important to bring the world-defined baseline to be tested because the vehicles [indistinct – dropping voice] like the SANDF.     I am not at liberty to complain – to comment on the implications on people who are trying to do this or do that but what I can actually comment on are the importance of the test.     Yes, whether people were trying to hide or not, it is not my business to compare.     As an RSMA standard officer, as a Plus Specialist we have to conduct that test before we give it to our users.     Thank you.

NKOSI: Just that whatever thing that they ...[intervenes]    Congratulations can mean anything, congratulation can mean that maybe thanks for having made – passed the engineering tests, see you again on the TP2 that is administered by Armscor.  Congratulations can basically mean anything.   The certificates, oddly, the actually subsequently requested to be changed again in the year 09.   They changed the test number – unfortunately I am not party to the reasons why did they change the test number. 
MR MLIPHA:  Xolani Lincoln Mlipha.     I do not.    Yes I do.     So help me God.     Yes Chair thank you.     Good afternoon Mr Kennedy.     Understood.     That is correct.     Yes.     Understood.     Understood.     I do.     Yes.     That’s correct.     That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.      That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Correct.     Correct Chair.     It was in 2004, right.     I stayed there until 2008 end of year, December.     I joined Armscor.     That’s correct Chair.     That is right, on the 5 t h.     Systems Engineer.     Yes.     At Denel I was part of the compilation team, I was working on the ammunition segment where we prepared the offer to submit to Armscor and on behalf of Denel to do the job.     Yes it is different, correct.     No.     Chair my role is to do the systems engineering work on behalf of Armscor and that basically entails checking all the verification against each requirement that the contract has requested from Denel as the contracted agency, so I ensure that requirements are met and I check that it is correct.     In 2007 if I am not mistaken.     Page 12.  Yes Mr Chair?     Chair development phase would entail work that would be done to really start at times from scratch, at times not from scratch as you have heard that the vehicle was sourced from a different country, from a different company and we would make it suitable for South African needs, that is development work and then the – this other phase, that is the development phase, the other phase is the production phase where now what has been confirmed through development, the requirements that have been made are now producing many numbers of that particular product.     Apologise Mr Kennedy, I thought – yes second phase would then be ...[intervenes]      At the moment we are still in the development phase Chair because we have not obtained the baseline that says development is completed.   Chair what is required is to obtain a baseline that is referred to as the product baseline, abbreviated as PBL.       PBL, Papa, Bravo, Lima, PBL.     It would be – it is specified Chair yes.     Obviously in the contract it is also specified Chair but also in accordance with the established engineering standards that definition would be given.     I am there Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Apologies Mr Kennedy, 11.1?     Okay, I will read.     Yes I will read. “The product baseline is an approved set of data items, typically the product specification, integrated support plan, audit reports and results of reviews, which consolidates and documents the results of the design and development phase.”       That is correct Chair.     Correct.     That is correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Absolutely correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Chair that policy defines and provides guidelines as to how the acquisition is to be executed within the defence, particularly our defence industry.     Chair the policy cites other standards, so the next applicable document that it cites is the RSA Military Standard Number 3.     That is correct Chair.     Absolutely.     Yes Chair PDL is reference are the same as Standard 3 as one of the baselines that have to be achieved as part of doing projects acquisition.     Page 20, yes.  I am there Chair.     Chair stemming from RSA Standard 3 it states that a contractor, or anyone, whoever is doing the job, they are allowed to tailor, they may tailor.  In this instance the contract allowed and they tailored for a PBLA, let me call it that way and it is specified like that in the contract, so that is what was tailored.     PBLA.     Papa, Bravo, Lima, Alpha.     It stands for they call it – it was a risk reduction before the authentic PBL that Armscor would require.     Apology Chair, P stands for Product, B stands – B and L stands for baseline.     Yes Mr Chair, it is the same PBL we were talking about it is just now this is a tailored one.     The A is just a subscript that they – the A is a subscript that was provided to differentiate it from the one that we would want as Armscor, they call that one PBL1.     Chair I would say yes because RSA Standard 3 is an applicable document as part of this contract and one is supposed to do acquisition going through all these baselines yes, though one may tailor of course.     Correct chair.     Yes it is permissible I suppose it is not only limited to a PBL as the contract also did not just limit the tailoring to PBL, there are other baselines, ADL, that were also tailored, they tailored yes Chair.     Chair there is no prescribed way of tailoring but I would say it goes without misunderstanding that risk is part of tailoring that one must address firstly.     Correct Chair.        Yes Chair.     That is correct Chair of course it would have to be accepted.     Yes there has been yes.  Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.     I am there Chair.     Chair this SEMS, Systems Engineering Master Schedule is a document where the contractor plans at what point they would do engineering activities and this is where it is evident and one can see that from the onset at contracting that amongst others this tailored baseline was included.     Correct that was part of the contract Chair.     Yes, in particular I don’t know whether the SEMS is in front of you Chair, in particular there are reviews that were happening at a later point and audits that were happening earlier, that is what I attempt to show here, yes that is what I am trying to say that one has to juxtaposed it with what is in the normal standard that is untailored when we compare the tailored version to the untailored version.     Yes, in the untailored version that RSA Standard 3 one will see that there is a PBL there, and then Chair you will also notice that there are audits the FCA functional configuration audit and the physical configuration audit it is important to for one to note when they happen.     That is correct Chair, the sequencing is important.     Yes correct Chair.     The tailored version includes PBL A but also Chair, maybe I was clear, it does include the PBL 1 and PBL 1 would be the one that is equal to what Armscor would desire.     Correct Chair.     They are Chair.       Correct Chair.     Denel is compelled to comply with both of them, it is the – the PBL A is earlier than the PBL 1, PBL A is earlier than PBL 1, the reason for it is that they said they were reducing risk.     Ja it would happen earlier than PBL 1.     Correct Chair, they are both part of the contract.  Of course achieving PBL A then they would do work to also achieve PBL 1 and PBL 1 is the one is the one that Armscor is interested in.     For me from the technical perspective PBL 1 is important because that signifies as we read the definition earlier that signifies the achievement of requirements and the end of development.    Okay Chair.       In my opinion it introduced, it increased the risk for Armscor.    It is my opinion correct yes Sir.    Correct Chair I think you sum it well.    The risk was there, the attempt was to reduce the risk.    Unfortunately it increased the risk for us because as it is said that I – as I stated that activities were linked to payments.  Lines were linked to payment activities so at execution of any line that released cash whereas the solution seemed to lag behind or the achievement of the requirement seemed to lag behind and now as we find the situation today yes.    Chair I have to be clear.  The contracting was set out from the start and it executing any activity or a contracted line the project had to – had to be followed. So the – at executing any activity it meant that – and if it was correct it meant that payment had to be made.  So that was – that was established as part of the contract.  It is in the contract.    Well my understanding is that if I can answer that in a way that I understand it to be technically correct is that what is – what we are interested in is achieving the requirements.  Unfortunately I do not deal with the project management side of works.  I am interested in achieving the requirements.   So for me I am really interested that there should be point where requirements are met and that would be a PBL1.  I hope that clarification.    It is correct Chair.    That was – the development term was set until that time.    There were indeed challenges Chair.    There were…    Ja.  Technical challenges indeed yes.    Yes, yes, yes.    Chair I – I – It is my opinion Chair that ja although I am not responsible for planning and phasing the project I think it contributed in the sense that financial planning is – or financial activities are coupled to those activities and yes as part of also the contract I read that PBLA was one of the major decision points.    Chair I think August this year we – oh ja I think end of August this year we sat with the contractor and went through the compliance against requirements and the team or Armscor and DLS have merged towards a position where we agree what is – what is achieved and what is not achieved because we had a serious dispute relating to what was – what was complied with and what is not complied with.  So I think – ja in August we got to that point and the activities now are really trying to sum up the PBL1 that Armscor is interested in.    Chair there are serious requirements that are not complied with as we heard that have been put on the table to be discussed with higher authorities but at my level on technical level these are critical requirements that are not met and we have at least now with the contractor agreed that these are not met whereas in the past we were not agreeing.    Chair I am careful maybe to speak…    Yes.    Yes.    Chair the reason why I am careful is because I do not want to…    And also the contractor has maybe made mention that they have exhausted their efforts so they are coming to declare what they have achieved and – so that is why I am saying.    As early as August we have reached now an agreement of what we know.    That is correct unless you want me to elaborate.    That is correct that is my stand point.    In the sense that they were saying they do the work and they have to be paid – yes that is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Chair it becomes – Chair it becomes a serious problem if I can make example of one.  If for example we do an audit prematurely – an audit of an item that we say is now ready to proceed into the next phase of the lives of the acquisition process.  Let me make example of a physical configuration audit.  If we audit the physical item and say this is now the one before it has finished its development life we run a risk of repeatedly checking or auditing an item that is still evolving in its development life.  That is one of the issues for an example.    Chair the system requirements review is the review that if I can sum it up is the review that says you – one has the – the contractor or the developing – the developing agent understands the requirements that have been contracted to them.  And they will endeavour to achieve them.  So this review really goes into detail of saying you have captured all the requirements; there are no requirements that are missed.  That is the essence of this system requirements review.    Chair this is true.  I prefer to speak in pictures because it is much easier.  At a higher level there is – there is a requirement specification and the developing agency – the contractor has to meet these requirements.   And now in meeting these requirements a developer will maybe say okay they will compile their own specification which they will name a development specification that says each requirement is going to be made in this manner.  This is what they will do.   Now with regards to what I am stating here is that when that was done as recently as 2018 in one of the reviews I learnt that Denel informed us that they are not DLS; they are not developing to meet the Armscor spec – bless you Chair – they are developing to meet the Armscor spec but the development specification.   This to me was an issue in the sense that obviously there would be a delta between the two and we must now make sure that this delta is covered in the sense that if the contractor is saying, I am only meeting my specification; yours you must now check whether having met the development specification you are satisfied as Armscor.  That was for me the issue.    Yes.     “I have reviewed the PCA’s which were conducted by DLS and it was noted that all PCA’s are planned and conducted sequentially incorrect.  This defeats the purpose of a valuable PCA where there is no value in the configuration as the design is still evolving.”    Yes Sir.    Chair they would not be in the sense that the PCA that would be done for PBLA – PBLA is a point or a base line where functionality has not been achieved or requirements have not been achieved.  So for one to be interested in those PCA’s in my opinion not everyone will differ with me – in my opinion defeats the purpose.    It is both Chair.  It is not – it is also attributable to that but also it is a problem in the understanding of the – the engineering sequencing and the essence of auditing something that is not yet fully developed.    The significance of what I am trying to highlight here is that firstly it was before the PBL1 as per contractor language or PBL as per Armscor language.  It may have happened also before or after PBLA but what I also highlight is that so much money has now been exhausted in auditing something that does not have a product base line in Armscor’s understanding.    Chair I am careful with this because it is contracted but technically if you ask me it helped – it did not help me. ADV KENNEDY    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Yes Chair I received support from my immediate superior with particular to this one where he also agreed to say this is not in line.    Mr Dave Erasmus.    Yes.    At – yes – yes correct Chair.    Would it be pertinent to mention the – the critical design review?    Design Reviews the CER.    The review.    I see it is..    Yes.      Chair this is also one of the points that are – of contention in the sense that when one reads the standards or when one looks at RSA-Mil standard 3 I hope Chair has a picture of the process one will see that the CDR is pictorially painted close to PBL.   One who maybe does not read the wording may understand that this review is conducted to close out the development phase meaning that it is the last review before achieving PBL which is not correct.   The CDR as the word says it is the critical design review but when one reads the definition of it it is very easily for one to understand that – to misunderstand that they are talking of production.  Whereas the critical design review is – is referring to the permission to build now the test item that will undergo testing.   Now the words that are used at times there is fabricate – permission to fabricate. Now one may misunderstand it and think it is now talking – it is now permission to go into production whereas no it is not that.  It is just permission to – to build the test item.   Later we show it is – that is what we would call an engineering development model.  That is the one that will face now qualification.    Correct Chair.    Chair as part of the complete project with all elements that have to be delivered it was stipulated in the contract that there should be a training segment.  Now the training segment includes – in fact the contract also stipulated that there should be a training simulator.   A training simulator Chair is a training tool.  It is a tool that enables one to train on a replacement product instead of the actual product.  In this case they computerise it, they make it out of computers and it is listed in the contract what they are supposed to deliver.   The issue that I tried to raise here is that though one is supposed to deliver these training tools the training requirement as a whole – the training system is not limited only through a training tool but one should address the whole requirement regarding training.   And at the time when – very early on when I was also asked to be a Project Manager for one of the variants I had an issue that the contractor was going straight into simulator building without really compiling as I said earlier there is a requirement and there is a development specification that says how one will meet these requirements.  This training development spec was not there.  In fact it was compiled much later.  That was my one issue.   And then the second issue is that these training tools, the simulators were now running far ahead of the actual product.   Now one has – will have a problem that now you have to correct the training tool if the product is still – to a point that the tools – the simulators are delivered.     Sorry, Mr Kennedy.  We are ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Correct, yes.     Correct, Chair.     Chair, requirements, if they are not met, we classify them as non-compliant.  Now what transpired.  Until recently when it was addressed with the help of our management in support, was that.. It is my understanding that whenever Denel was facing challenges of meeting the requirement, they would put in a deviation.  People would differ with me.  It is my opinion.   Now, deviations were used in a way of reaching an end to say now they meet the requirement.  Now in normal language, deviation means you are not... its otherwise of what you are supposed to get.   However, in engineering it is that but it also means that one must... whenever one requests a deviation.  Firstly, one should request a deviation before testing.  If you do it after testing, it is now after the fact.   And if you request a deviation, it is also understood it is temporary.  It is not a permanent state to say now I am not required to meet this requirement or because I got a deviation, I now meet the requirement.   That was the strange understanding.  And that is what, in essence, I am trying to explain to say.  Deviations were used in a way of saying they meet the requirement.       You can put it that way, Chair.     Yes, yes.  You can put it ...[intervenes]      Not only ...[intervenes]      Not only... if I check... if I may check, Chair?  Exceptions, yes, as you put it that it is just for this instance.     You are expected to correct this issue and come back and meet the requirement.     Ja.     H’m.     You may call it that Chair.     Phase is the correct term.     Yes.     H’m.     Yes, Chair there is a problem in this issue because for one to industrialise, you would want to industrialise a product that has met the requirements.  Now if one would industrialise a product that has not met the requirements, you run the risk of repeating the ...[indistinct] [laughing]     Apologies Chair.       Industrialisation means in, for example, in this type of this project, you have to now set up a factory.  You have to set up production lines ...[intervenes]      You have to train or you have to get process engineers that will build the ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     Chair, you ...[intervenes]      Chair, you are absolutely correct.     [No audible reply]      Chair, there is an issue.  In fact, Denel approached Armscor and they said they would like to declare both the product baseline and at the same time confirm industrialisation on the enter production.   Now at one particular meeting, I asked the question to say it cannot be.  And in particular, with regards to the vehicle hull that if there are now industrialising and preparing to build many, what floor are they building or what product?  Because we have not verified everything.   Ja.  Yes, so there is that dispute and... Yes.     [No audible reply]      The baseline is a culmination of the industrialisation phase.       They were referring to the product baseline, PDL and the MBL.     Yes, they said the two have been achieved.     Ja.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     I was not involved Chair, yes.     408.  Four, zero...  Ja, 408.     I have it.  I have it, sir.       Correct, Chair.  This is the document that I compiled recently.     416?     Yes, I am there Chair.     Yes, Chair.  As I assumed that you have the acquisition process in front of you.  Firstly, the functional configuration audit is a document that is an input to the audits that is conducted by Armscor Quality Division. It is an input to that audit, QES.  They refer to Quality Engineering Services.  Because that division will say that the baseline is indeed correct and has been established. The issue ensued when the contractor was stating that they have audited themselves and they say they are good.  Now I think it is understandable that one cannot audit oneself because you will be biased in auditing yourself. So then as part of the reviews, we said as the minimum – because referable there should be an independent body that audits.  As the minimum, we will compile an audit that we will share with the contractor and inform them this our official position. That is the reason why I compiled the document.  It is now not the norm...  [cell phone ringing]  Apologies Chair.       Sorry Chair.     It is not the norm for one to... for Armscor to write audits and share with the contractor.  QES Division gets involved and does that.   But because of the technical disagreements that were happening between us, Armscor and Denel, I felt it important, together with the Armscor Team, that let us compile a report. And audit the report and share with them that this our position, official position, so that we could inform our leadership to say this is where we stand. This document I compiled with the permission.  I informed my immediate manager and I informed also the leaders to say we as the project, we will write the report. And we share it with the contractor and the contractor did not object heavily to it.  Yes.  That is the history of this document.       416, yes.  Yes, Chair.     It is correct Chair.  This is now as a summary of what now had been happening over the years and to say now we are putting it in this audit report.  And just showing to them that this is what we will compile in our report.  Yes.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.     The outstanding requirement with regards to crew protection liability and others...  I do not know if am at liberty of going into the detail of the requirements?       Okay.     Yes, there are requirements that are critical and may result in catastrophic outcomes.  So yes, those definitions, I included there as a means of guiding everyone.  Because we had to now guide everyone to say what is meant by catastrophic events, what is meant by a critical event that... et cetera.   If the product is not meeting such a requirement.  If the requirement is of a critical of catastrophic consequence, what does that mean.  For an example, the crew survivability in the event of a landmine threats.   Now the details surrounding that issue is that the contractor does say that they were not contracted for TP3 as you heard earlier Chair.   Now it becomes a bit problematic for my side, technical compliance, in the sense that now, now will we address this crew survivability requirement?  Because...       How do... Yes, Chair.     How do we – what do we say?     Yes, Chair.  What do we say.     [cell phone interruption]  Sorry, Chair.  Yes.  Well, then the contractor said they...  Since that requirement is not yet contracted, they are willing to do the test but they want that requirement to be contracted now to say ...[intervenes]      Chair, the position from the contractor is this.  They have met the first lower level requirement as you heard earlier of protection against hull breach anywhere under the vehicle or wheel shots.  They have met that one.   The TP3 is that requirement that is now equivalent or will verify the crew survivability.  Now if it is not done, how would one then now say the crew inside the vehicle is okay?   Because we have not done this test to really see if, for example, items that are mounted inside the vehicle are dislodged and they become projectiles towards passengers that they hit them.   Or as earlier, you heard that there even may be even be skewered by or stabbed by certain...  Because one must appreciate the environment that one is in.  It is a very confined environment inside the vehicle.  So ja, I...   Chair, when you asked me that, I also do not know what you say because it is such a critical requirement.  Although, I must highlight Chair that as part of negotiations, contract negotiations way before I was involved.  It was stated that a TP2 test would be used to validate the vehicle.   Now as you have heard earlier Chair.  A TP2 test is a lower, is of a lower level and may not be used to really confirm that the crew is safe inside.      Chair, I would be careful to say that without objective evidence supporting that.     So I would be inclining to say ...[intervenes]      One must be careful then.     Yes.     Yes.     You are correct Chair.     There are divided camps.     And the fact of the matter is that when we look at requirements clinically, there is that requirement who would say this requirement has not been verified for crew safety.     Yes, Chair you are absolutely correct.     There is a serious amount of uncertainty.     Yes.     Chair, as I mentioned that Denel, DLS responded obviously with objections and I did inform them that we... I accept their objections in particular the reference to the landmine that they are not contracted to it.   But as the report says, then that we are sitting with the dilemma of not being in a position to classify the vehicle in terms of safety or not.   And we are leaning more towards saying that one has to be careful as you heard from Mr Nkosi.  And that is where the report is and the intend of the report, as it is stated earlier, is that it will be submitted to the...   It is an input to the QES audit.  And once it is received by that division, they will then consider everything that is on the table and they will make a decision.     Correct, Chair.  Amongst others, for example, compliance.  The compliance...  The contractor was saying, they achieved 99% compliance against our requirement.  As you see in the report, we disagree with that.   And we went into numerous workstations where we have now, for example, we removed all those, the compliances which the contractor said they complied because they have deviations.       Ja.     Thank you, Chair.   
XOLANI LINCOLN MLIPHA:  [duly sworn, states] 
 MR MLIPHA:  I am… 
MLIPHA: I shall attempt. The PCA Physical Configuration Audit is an audit that says this bottle of water if I can – is – is made to contain so much water and it does meet with requirements that were set out.  So the PCA in essence is an audit that is done after having achieved the functionality that is required.   It is an audit that leads one into saying now you may build more or make more of these items.  So actually it is an outcome of an industrialisation process not a development process.  An audit that is applicable to the development process is the functional configuration audit for reasons I have explained earlier I say that if one would be concerned of doing a physical configuration audit on an item that is still evolving in its development life one is not achieving much because the contractor would be allowed to change the design if the requirement is not met.   Chair, the essence goes with the requirements that were set out from the onset and the fact that this requirement – in fact, it is split into two.   It is at a lower level, it refers to a hull or and wheel detonation as we have heard previously.  That the hull or the shell of the vehicle should not rapture and hit... a landmine hit under a wheel should also not result in a rapture. Then the second level of requirements refers to the crew survivability when the vehicle is exposed such a threat.  It is a requirement that the crew should survive.  It is a requirement.   So that for me is the essence of it.  And then when one now goes into the criteria or the criteria that was set from... as part of the contract to say which is a critical criteria. A critical criteria is to be understood as that criteria that one has to meet and not meeting that requirement, the person should be disqualified.   And from reading evidence that is presented or that we had to do as also part of my work of the requirement verification and thorough work and seeing that with authenticities achieved here. One observe that the first test for this landmine was failed as you heard earlier Chair.  Now at that instance, it is my understanding that because it is a critical criteria, that there should not have been any progress.
