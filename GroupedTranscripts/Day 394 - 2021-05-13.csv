CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Good.  Good morning Mr Zwane.    Good morning.  Thank you for availing yourself and thank you to your legal representative for all the cooperation.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Are you ready Mr Seleka?   Okay alright please administer the oath or affirmation.    Thank you.  We may proceed.    Yes.    Yes.    Are we – I see his sworn statement at 201 not 51 – did you say 501?    351 is the first one.    Let me see.      Okay well…    That cannot be the first – ja.    The first one must be the one at 201.    Ja.      Ja.    Ja.    353.?     I guess we must start by admitting that is it not?    Ja.  Go ahead.    Yes.  The affidavit of Mr MosebenziJoseph Zwane that starts at page 353.219 will together with his annexures be admitted and will be marked as Exhibit U41.3.    No, no that is fine but I wonder whether it would not be convenient to finalise everything connected with emails.    And I know the emails will go all over the place.  They will – they will touch upon all the items I think you mentioned but it might be convenient to just deal with that – get it out of the way even if after that you can thenfocus on specific topics.    If that is not going to disturb your plan.    Ja last time.    Ja.  Ja.    Just tell us first where to find that.     253 or 353?    Okay.  Ja okay.    Have you found the page Mr Zwane?    Okay alright.    Okay.    Alright.      Of course you – you say you were one of those three.    Ja.    By the way who was Ms Matau [?] just remind me?    Yes.    Office manager.    In your office.    Oh okay.    I am sorry.   So is your version Mr Zwane that the fact that you and the choir travelled in the same flight to India was just a coincidence or you say no it was planned that let us go together but we were going for different purposes and we were not being paid for by the same source.  I was being paid for by the Department and I do not know who was paying for the choir.    Yes but it does not answer my question.  My question is whether it was just a coincidence or it was a plan – it was planned that you – you would travel in the same flight with the choir.    Yes.  So as far as you are concerned it was a coincidence.    Okay alright.   Mr Seleka.    And where is the affidavit?    308.   Paragraph 27.    On page?    315.    Okay got it.    Ja continue – finish.   My understanding of what Mr Dlamini is saying is that they as the intended beneficiaries of the projects had been promised training.  Now if the training was to take place in India maybe that would not be surprising because the evidence is to the effect that, and I think it is the evidence of Mr Talete(?) is to the effect that he had undertaken a trip to India, I think he had also gonethere with Mr Maria(?)     Ja.  And as I recall, the – his evidence, the purpose of the trip by him was to go and see how the Indian company, I forget what it was called now ...[intervenes]      Paras.  How they dealt with what you wanted to do under this project in the Free State because he said it seemed that there was something to be learnt asto how they dealt with that(?).  So he went there and of course as we know, according to his evidence, ultimately that company was part of the project in the Free State, according to his evidence.There is a suggestion that that company denied that but let us leave that aside.  According to his evidence that was the company was part of the Estina Project and of course people who were brought in to work on the project were from India.      Ja.     Okay.  Mr Seleka.     What is the name of the choir?  Let us call it by the name.     Umsingizane.  Ja.     Yes ...[intervenes]      Ja, well, Umsingizane is a Zulu word.     It – Umsingizane is ...[intervenes]      ...part of grass.     So...  But I do not know whether that is what they had in mind.     It may mean that the choir was intended to be well-grounded, well-rooted.  [laughs]  Do you know ifconnect with what I am saying Mr Zwane or is there something else?     Or maybe it is not Zulu.     [laughs]     [laughs]     That name.     H’m, h’m.     Ja, ja.     H’m, h’m.     H’m, h’m.     Yes, ja. MR     Ja.     Ja, yes.     Well, I think you know more Umsingizane than I do.  [laughs]     Okay alright.     Well, I was going to say.  Anyway, this is the only choir we are talking about.  So if you forget the name, if you say the choir ...[intervenes]      ...wel will know which one.     The organiser or the conductor?     Okay.     That are connected with the choir.     Okay.     Thomo.     Ja.  He said Mr Thomo would organise.     And Thomo is t-h-o-m-o or -t-o-m-o?     T-h-o-m-o, ja.     And you remember his name or not?     Mfanafuthi?     Okay. [Indistinct] [laughs]     That is the Zulu version.     [laughs]     You cannot change them.  [laughs]     [laughs]  Well, I have – I suspect that he is not the firstborn in his family because when you are given that name, it means that there is a boy or boys ahead of you.  [laughs]     So the parents say    Ja.     Girl, ja.     Ja.     [laughs]    Okay alright.     Yes.       353.129?     Okay.       Oh, Mr L Thomo.  I am saying mister but it does not mister but it is F L Thomo.     That should be the person?     Okay alright.     H’m.  So this is an email from Ashu, whom I take to be Ashu Chawla, simply because there is an Ashu Chawla that is connected with Sahara Computer because his email is ashu@sahara.co.za.  So he sends an email on the 13 t h of October12 to nareshkhosla@susindia.com(?) and he says room-sharing but before that, there is an email from mzwane@gmail.com.  I think you have accepted that that is your email address.  And it is on October 13, 2012 and it is     Ja.     By the way, I think you said you gave it to an official in your office to help her – help them.  Is that right?     So it was sent by an official in youroffice.     Or in the department.     To Ashok Narayan.     As this – yes.     Ja.     Ja, ja, ja.     Yes. MR     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, yes.  So.  And you say that you never told anybody that you were going to be on this trip and that you would be one of those who would not be sharing rooms?     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, no, no.  I understand that.  I am trying to get to understand how your name came to be here.  So you are clear that you never the official who – to whom you gave your gadget that you were going to be part of this trip?     Of the choir.     Yes.       And you never told them that you should be put in the list of those who would not be sharing rooms?     So you do not know where they got this from?     You have a recollection whether on the occasion you gave your gadget to the official, there was a member of the choir who was there in your office at thetime or who was going to be with the official who used your gadget?     You cannot remember?     H’m, h’m.     Well, you came to the Commission on a public holiday, Mr Zwane.  So.  [laughs]     Ja.    In that function?     And it was a departmental function?     Okay.     H’m?    H’m.  Okay.  So, would the answer be that there would have been member of the choir with the official or you are not sure?     But you know that they were performing?     Ja.     Okay no that is fine.  Mr Seleka.     Must be attached to your affidavit, is it not?     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Well, maybe – let us do it quickly.     At page two – 353.235.  What document is that Mr Zwane?    Transaction log sheet.  Do you know what it represents?  It is written surname in English as Zwane, M J.  A cell number is given and then the date given is 07/12/12 and the transaction code is given there and another code and the badge.  What document is that and what is it supposed to show?     H’m?  Well, what – that date of 7 December 2012, what does it represent?  It is a date for what?  Do you know?    Ja.     Ja.     MEC’s.     Ja.    Ja.     Yes.     Well, the reason we have to ask is because you attached them to your affidavit.  So that is why we have to ask you what do they represent.     Let us go to page 353.236.  What does that document represents?  It says, in the heading,     Okay.  And there is reference to advance taken and then there is an amount and that is – what is written there is 729504.  And then next to that, there issomething handwritten and it is like divide by three and 30(a)(?).  And then on that column, there is 729504 and the total is 729504.  Is that the amount you claimed for SNT that is R 729 504,00?     Ja.     H’m?     Yes but do you know whether the amount is what are indicating here or is it perhaps seven thousandtwo hundred and ninety-five Rand four cents or is it seven hundred and twenty-nine thousand five hundred and four Rand?     Well, you must remember [laughs] you SNT claim for what ten days or whatever could have gone up to seven hundred and twenty-nine thousand Rand?     Seven thousand?     H’m.     And four cents.     Ja.  Okay, okay.  Alright.  And I see that it is stamped 6 December 2012.  And you simply have signed on the 16 t h of November 2012 ...[indistinct] signed also.  Yes. Mr Seleka, do you want to say – ask any questions...?     Maybe for the sake of completeness, Mr Seleka, you can also just check when the choir came back.     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Zwane?    The first question is that according to this document that we just dealt with namely the one at page 353.236 your trips to – you left on the 15 t h or the SNT claim relates to a period starting from the 15 October 2012 and ending on 23 October 2012 whereas Mr Seleka says the choir left on the 13 October two days before this and I think that question is being asked in the context of the fact that you – it is your evidence that you did travel in the same plane as the choir.     Ja.    Ja.     Ja, okay.  Now but your recollection is that you came back from India on the 23 October.     Yes.     And the choir – Mr Seleka says the choir came back on the 22 October.  Is that correct, Mr Seleka?     Yes, I can see that, I do not know if Mr Zwane can see it, 21 October 2017, 17.00 arrival at Mumbai Hotel, pick up intercontinental and relax for the rest of the evening, 22 October, 8 o’clock breakfast at hotel.  9 o’clock checkout – that is now 22 n d, checkout fromthe hotel and proceed for [indistinct] India, lunch outside nearby and going towards an Orbit Mall, shopping and dinner and after that straight proceed for airport to fly back home.     Luxury [indistinct] required at Mumbai International at 8 a.m. for the whole day [indistinct] and drop at airport at 10.30 p.m.  That must be 10.30 p.m. on the 22 n d, I think?     Up to 12 hours and 120 kilometres [indistinct] hour.  Well, that – if that – in terms of that itinerary, the choir could not have arrived back on the 22 n d.  I think.     Because they were still going to spend a day there but do we have anything that shows when they actually arrived back?     And not in – there is nothing that indicates…     Ja.     Well, it say here at page 353.131    So if they were going to – if that is on the 22 n d, which much be evening, I guess, then they would have arrived in South Africa on the 23 r d.  A flight from India to South Africa, if you leave in the evening in India, you would arrive on the 23 r d, would you not?  Mr Zwane, you know you did fly.    Yes, yes, yes.  I think we must just check, see if there is something concrete about when they arrived.     Ja.  Of course what this does raise, Mr Zwane, which you obviously appreciate, I think, is it seems that your stay in India was for more or less the same duration as the choir.     Ja.  So you have a situation where    Ja.     Oh, yes, yes, ja, yes.  Do you want to deal with that?    On what I am saying.     Yes, ja, there is a difference.     No, no, I accept that, that is why I said almost.     I said it is for almost the same period.     353.241.     Ja.     Let us get there, 241.     Sorry?  243?     Oh.     Okay, just say it again, I am getting confused.       353 point?     Okay, I am there.     Let start – first say this appears to be a letter from Mr M Peter, head of department for Agriculture, addressed to the Premier, Honourable E S Magashule, Free     Yes.  Yes, yes, 2.3 says – that off that     Okay, alright.  But you accept, I guess, you accept that – you accept the things that I was observing to say – except for saying if the choir left on the 13 t h, you left on the 15 t h, but you accept that it is almost the same duration.     Ja.  Okay, alright.     Ja, almost exactly, ja.     Because you could not have been on the same flight with them to India and be on the same flight with them from South Africa to India again on the 15 t h.  So either your department has got it wrong about the 15 t h or somebody else who says the choir left on the 13 t h got it wrong, it is not the 13 t h, it is the 15 t h.  But in the end itmight not matter whether it is the 13 t h or the 15 t h if it is accepted, as you do accept, that you were on the same flight to India with the choir and indications are that the choir must have arrived back on the 23 r d as well.  We are not sure but we suspect based on that itinerary.  If the choir also arrived back on the 23 r d then your period of – or the trip with the choir is exactly the same, if that is the position.  So you accept that, those facts, except that we are not sure that the choir arrived back on the 23 r d but it looks like it, that is what we are saying.     Yes.  Okay.     Must change that.  Ja, okay.    At the expense of…     Guptas, ja.     No, I think, Mr Zwane, the point you make is an important point, namely that you are dealing with the allegation that your trip was paid for by Guptas at all.    You are saying I have checked with the department, here are documents that support my version that I was – this was an official trip and it was not paid for by the Guptas, it would have been paid for by the department.  But the other aspects, that we have been dealing with, may be related to the issue that you said that you may have been in the plane, the same plane, was just a coincidence, you were not involved in the planning of the choir trip, that it might go to say was it all a coincidencebut you are right to say the issue of who paid is an important issue for your trip.  Ja. Okay, alright, let us take the tea adjournment, we will resume at quarter to twelve, it is nearly twenty five to.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let us continue.     I think we have exhausted this email, ja, let’s continue.     Page 353.22.    Look at the black numbers, remember to look at the black numbers on the left corner of each page.    353.21, and that is Mr Theron’s affidavit as I understand the position.     Ja, you found it?     Okay.     I’m sorry, Mr Seleka, don’t forget the question or point you wanted to pursue.  Can we go back or no, we don’t need to go back?     What was the purpose of your trip to India on 15 October to 23 October 2012?     It was two Ministers, is that right?     I think when I looked at that letter from Mr Thabethe to the Premier, it was two Ministers is that right?     Yes, the one was Minister of Agriculture the other one – or they were Ministers of Agriculture from different states?     Okay but both were Ministers of Agriculture?     In Paras, yes.     Yes.     H’m.     That meeting with the CEO?     Okay.    Yes.     H’m.     H’m.     So, was the purpose of the trip, therefore – of your trip, therefore, to meet with the twoMinisters of Agriculture, from different states and to visit the Paras part or head quarters, is that right?     Those are the three important things you were to do while you were in India, as far as the department was concerned?     Okay.     Let’s go – where is that letter from Mr Thabethe?     241?     Oh, it was three?    Okay the one was Mr Rawat, Singh Rawat and the other was Mr Yadav.      And the other was Mr Patel, Mr Patel was on the 22 n d, yes.  So, on the 16 t h of October, Mr Rawat, on the 18 t h of October, Mr Yadav and then on the22 n d of October Mr Patel.  Okay and then, Paras was supposed to be on the 19 t h yes, okay, alright, thank you, Mr Seleka then we can…[intervenes].     Ja.     We can go back to the – oh you are pursuing something…[intervenes].     Ja, okay.     Ja.     You were going to check Paras capacity to do what?     H’m.  Do you remember whether Mr Thabethe’s trip to India preceded yours or you preceded his?     But you do know he did go to India?     Ja.     Ja, and he – I would imagine when he came back, he would have given you a report?     Yes, that’s if of course it did precede yours…[intervenes]. MR     He would have got all the information.     Yes, yes.     Yes, so it seems to me, and I want you to comment on this, it seems to me that the Paras meeting wouldn’t really have been essential for you if, indeed, yourDG or Head of Department had been there because he would be the operations man, he would be the one who would have got all the information, in order to be able to make an assessment whether Paras could be a partner but it may be that, because you were going to be in India anyway, you might have thought, if we are going to have – if my department is going to have a working relationship with Paras I may as well see them so – but in terms of it being essential, it probably wouldn’t have been, would you agree or would you not agree?    Ja, you think it was very essential?     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Okay.MR     Okay.     Mr Seleka, in interrupted you.     Well, if that is so, my recollection is thatby October a lot of ground had been covered in terms of this Estina project.  So, your meeting wouldn’t have been an essential meeting because by then, if my recollection is correct,  the decision to partner with Paras had long been made, I may be mistaken, but I’m thinking there was an agreement that was concluded in June or July, I think there were three contracts. I think the one was July 5 if I’m not mistaken July 5 I know that there was one…[intervenes].       7 June, and so on so, the relevant decisions had long been made if that is the case.     Yes.     Yes, but you can’t verify whether they exist when you have already signed an agreement with them, you should verify that before you sign agreements, isn’t it?     H’m?     You say, even if they’ve signed, I want to see.     Ja.     What is happening there?     H’m.     Okay.     H’m.     Okay.     Mr Seleka?     Yes. ADV SELEKA     Ja, no, that’s fine but the one point which is of interest is that I read his affidavit, paragraph 9to mean that you were the one who recommended that he undertakes this trip together with Mr Ashok Narayan.  Now, if I recall from his evidence, when he was giving evidence, and I may be mistaken, but I seem to think that he said that when you told him about him going with Mr Narayan to India, that he said, you said, that came from the Premier.  I hope I’m not wrong, but he certainly said it was – the fact that he had to go with Narayan who wasn’t something that came from him and he seems to have said, you told him, you mentioned it to him, but if my recollection is correct, it seems that you might have got that from the Premier.  Does that jog your memory at all?     Ja, ja.    So, what you say – I think you say will be done by him, I found it strange that it was done by him in regard to you. I would have thought that if an MEC wanted the Premier ’s permission to travel overseas the MEC would write to the Premier rather than an official writing to the Premier asking the Premier to release the MEC.  I can understand him writing in regard to officials of the department, but I found that a little strange but, maybeyou say, no that’s how we used to do things.     H’m.     H’m.      Okay, no, that’s fine, Mr Seleka?     Well, I see, in Mr Thabethe’s affidavit,paragraph 10, you don’t need to go there, that he says, on his trip to India with Mr Narayan he did meet with the CEO of Paras Dairy for some reason he said, who’s name will be divulged at a later stage and he explained the whole chain of milk production in India.  He says there were also staff members of Paras who were further accompanied by the Indian delegation to visit the processing plant and in India I brought back my presentation from the Paras.  It is on our return from India, that is paragraph 11,  “that I then developed an Executive Council’s reportcarrying recommendations into the concept of a dairy project identified in India as Siyata ...[indistinct] MPPC’s.  After the Indian trip Mr Narayan went back to the office of the Premier as he was not part of my team save for the sake of accompanying me to India.  The executive council upon receiving the report on recommendations of the MEC from the Department of Agriculture then approved  – approval document is ...” I am just mentioning that that is what I have just ...[indistinct] in other words even though you may not have met the CEO Mr – Mr Thabethe had met the CEO of Paras. Okay.    Mr Seleka.   Mr Seleka.   Yes that is true.    Well maybe let us start with this.   You accept that no agreement – I just hope I am right now.  No agreement was ever concluded between the Department of Agriculture and Paras in regard to the Estina project.   Ja.  And when you discovered that the Department had never concluded any agreement with Paras what did you do in circumstances where – when were all along you were under the impression that the department had an agreement with Paras?    2013.    2013.    Okay but when you discovered was it afteryou had left the department when you discovered that…    Okay alright.    Replaced by another one in July.    Yes but hang on Mr Zwane we understand that.     The question is really relates to Paras.    So you have said that you did get to know at some stage that the Department of Agriculture had not concluded any contracts or agreement with Paras but you say you only got to know that after you had left thedepartment.    Because you say you left the Department of Agriculture in March 2013.    Now did Mr Thabethe the HOD of your department tell you that there was a contract between the department and Paras? Is that where you got the information from or where did you get the information from that the – there was an agreement or contract between the department and Paras?    But the question is did Mr Thabethe tell you that the department had concluded an agreement with Paras or did he not tell you?  Where did you get the impression from that the – there was an agreement between the Department of Agriculture and Paras?    Yes but was it your impression or did he tell you as the HOD?  Remember that this is somebody that had undertaken a trip to Paras in India.    And you knew about that trip.  You obviously approved the trip as the MEC – when I say    Yes.  So your impression that there was an agreement between the department and Paras was based onwhat?    Your impression.    Did you ever ask Mr Thabethe for the agreement with Paras because you were under the impression that the Department had an agreement with Paras, did you ever ask him to show you the agreement?    But how are you going to play your oversight if your department has or you understand the department to have contracts with another entity involvingmillions and millions or rands and you never even want to see this contract?    But my questions – you said as MEC you – your role is play oversight.    Over the department over the HOD.  You take the trouble of wanting to make this CEO at – of Paras wanting to go to Paras and meet them because you want to even verify whether this Paras exists or whatever you want to verify.  One would have thought that if you want to do that the least you would do is let me see the contract that the department has.  How do you play oversight in regard to a project where you have no idea what the contract says aboutthe project and the partnership?    But then you – if you do not do it that way – you do not ask to see the contract when you see the contract you might not need to go through every clause but at least you can look at the main clauses or features there might be a memorandum that explains to you the main features of the contract but at least you see it.   Now when you do not see it and you do not call for the contract the result may be what happened namely in October 2012 you are under the impression that your department has a contract with Paras.  You are in India –you want to meet with the CEO of Paras and I suspect you are going to say to the CEO of Paras I know that we have a contract with you and then he would say what are you talking about?   You would feel embarrassed I would imagine.  Because you did not have – the department did not have a contract. But then the question that arises is even the trip that Mr Thabethe undertook to India even whatever expenses if any may have been connected with your meeting with him maybe there were not any because you were going to be inIndia anyway or other meetings they could have been   Wasteful – fruitless and wasteful expenditure because why are going to India to meet an entity with whom you have no contract?  You understand.  Whereas if you asked for the contract you would have been told there – the department would have failed to give you a contract and you would have said but why – what kind of partnership do you say we have with Paras is we do not even have a contract.  You would have raised that question is it not?    Ja.    Yes I am there.    No, no, no nobody says – nobody says you were not – you are saying you were under the impression that the department had a contract with Paras    You said you are not in a position to sayMr Thabethe told you that the department had a contract with Paras. Okay.  Nobody says your impression – your evidence that you were under that impression is wrong.  So nobody is saying your – you were – you did not have that impression.  You understand. So – so I asked you what gave rise to that impression and you may legitimately point to among other things the fact that in the letter that the – Mr Thabethe wrote to the Premier he said you were going to meet – you were going to have a meeting with Paras officials or whoever.  There may be other things that he said to you that made you gain that – that gave you that impression.  But what is strange to me is that also Mr Thabethe when he was giving evidence before this commission if I recall correctly I certainly understood him for quite sometime to be saying we were working with Paras.  But one was looking for the contract.  So where is the contract with Paras?  Because we can only see an agreement between the department and Estina and Estina is not Paras.   And then he said if I recall correctly he was under the impression that there was an agreement between Estina and Paras that Estina would be assisted by Paras or something like that.   But the whole project I think was promoted on the basis that Paras was part of the project but there wasnothing in writing that had been signed by Paras with the department to say Paras was part of the project.  That is my recollection.  Does it accord with your understanding?    Ja.    Ja.    Your understanding.    Hm.  But now what did you know Estina’s role to be in this project as at October 2012?  Did you know about Estina at all?   You did not know about Estina?    When did you hear about Estina being involved in this project for the first time?    So do you recall around about when it was that this…    Transpired.    Were you still in the department?    So by the time you left the department in March 2013.    You had not heard about Estina being involved in this project.    Mr Thabethe had never told you about iteither in writing or verbally.    Well that – this is very strange or interesting but then Mr Zwane you have to concede that there must have been something wrong with how you were performing your oversight function over the department and over the HOD.  If for at least a year 2012 because MrThabethe went to India to see – to visit Paras in February 12 you left the department in March 2013. If for a whole year you were under the impression that in regard to this project Paras was the department’s partner it had a contract with the department on this project and you had heard nothing about Estina which was the entity that actually had an agreement with the department then there must something that was terribly wrong with performing oversight functions.   Whatever it is we might not be able to detect that maybe but any oversight where your own HOD – where your department can give you the impression that it has a contract with an entity a involving millions and millions of rands on a certain project when actually it only has a contract with b and you are – you are not aware of this entitycalled b then there must something that is not going well.  It should not be like that is it not?     Mr Zwane, the proposition is.  There must be something terrible wrong in the performance of oversight if it leads to a situation where the MEC of the department thinks the department has a contract with a company in India ...[intervenes]      ...and it turns out, he even wants to goand meet with the CEO of that company in India and it turns out that his department never had a contract with that company, number one.  Number two, if it turns out that its – his department had a contract with a local company, Estina, and for a whole year it did not know about. I am saying there must be something terrible wrong if performance of the oversight function by the MEC does not enable him to discover that.  Do you disagree?     Yes.  Why?  You think oversight – the oversight function would be performed quite well if such challenges would arise?     H’m?     But you call for information as well.     You must just rely on what officials give you.  You must have an understanding that will enable you    You say ...[intervenes]      You say it is fine if – are you saying that as an MEC in playing – in performing your oversight function over the department, you must only look at what the officials give you?  You must not call for otherdocuments that they might not be giving you which are important or relevant for your oversight function?     Mr Seleka, let me allow you to put questions to mister.     I know we are four minutes to one but I think let us adjourn for lunch at quarter past one.  Let me give you a chance to...     Ja.       [laughs]  No, that is fine.    I am sure, Mr Zwane, you can see this is not – the picture that you emerges is – you are going all the way to India to meet with somebody that you believe is the CEO of the company that the department has an agreement with, actually that is wrong.  There is no agreement.  But here it is Estina locally.  You are not...  [laughs]  You do not know about them.  You do not go and do oversight there.  [laughs]       Yes, Mr Seleka.     So what did you ask the CFO to do?     What issue was that?     So it was about R 84 million not the R 30 million?     For your department?     For the project?     Ja.  H’m?     H’m?    Ja.     H’m, h’m.     H’m.     So the – to your knowledge the meeting to which you were sending the CFO was to discuss money for the Estina Project?     [laughs]     I have never heard it called Paras Project.     Ja.     Or Vrede Dairy Projects.  Then you can...[intervenes]      ...it will suffice.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.  But you see, Mr Zwane.  Okay, letme ask this question.  I take it that you reported regularly to the Executive Council about how this project was going as well as other projects in your department?     Yes, yes.     No, no what I mean.  Once it had been approved ...[intervenes]      ...going forward up to the time you left the department.  I take it that you reported regularly at certain intervals to Exco ...[intervenes]      ...as to how the project was going.     Is that right?     And would that have been maybe – what?  At least once a month or once every three months ...[intervenes]      Or is that?     Ja, okay, okay.       Ja.     Ja.     H’m, h’m.     It was an important project?     Regularly.     H’m, h’m.     Okay, okay.     So in other words.  You should be up todate?     Because you can be asked anytime.     Yes.     Yes, yes.  You see the – it is just difficult to understand how it is possible that on a project that was so important to the province and to Exco and to your department and on which you could be asked anytime, you could be asked questions, you may have to report anytime.  How it is possible that throughout the period of February 2012 up to March when you left in 2013(?), you could not have known that there was Estina playing a role in the project unless the head of department made aconcerted effort that you should not know about Estina.       Ja, ja.     2012?     H’m?     Months by months?     H’m.     And what was brought to you by – or what was told to you by the HOD, Mr Thabethe, did not include him telling you that the company that the department had a contract with or had an agreement with was Estina?  That is not part of what he told you?    Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka, I know I said I was giving you time.  Would you like to go?  [laughs]     But ...[intervenes]ADV SELEKA     You have five minutes before we take the lunch break, ja.     [laughs]     [laughs]     Please tell me where to find it?     398, okay.     Continue.     Well, I see that Ms Dlamini later in her affidavit at page 353.415 ...[intervenes]      Okay.  [laughs]  I think I know why.    Okay, let us take the lunch break.  We will resume – it is now nearly twenty past one.  We will resume at twenty past two.      We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     I will now let you ask your questions.     What is point 60, is that 353.60? ADV SELEKA     Are we moving away from…?     Hang on one second?  You said we should go to 353.60.  That is where I am but I do not see a paragraph marked 4.     353.360?     Okay, alright.     Mr Seleka, do you recall whether in terms of the agreement between the department and Estina there was provision to say the prepayment should precede their actual commencement of the work.  We have called it prepayment.  I do not know whether that is what – thatcomes from the contract or not.  Do you remember what the position was?     But in terms of anything along the lines of it happening before any work was to be done, did you come across anything like that?     If it comes – ja.     No, that is fine.     You see, what I picked up in Ms Dlamini’s affidavit, Mr Zwane, I think it is the last page, if I am not mistaken – if you need us to go there we can go there.  What she does say is that there was urgency for the project to start or she posed it as kick-start the project.  Now I am understand the impression that you also spoke about urgency in regard to the project but I may be mistaken, am I right?     Yes, okay, okay.     So I am wondering whether the position is not that this payment of R8 million has to be made before the project could start because if the arrangement or agreement was that it should be paid first, it may be that it was urgent because the other party to the contract, Estina, which you thought was Paras, may have taken the position that we cannot start the project until you make this payment.  You understand what I mean?     You do not know what the position was.     Okay.  Mr Seleka?     It is Ncongwane.     You wanted to say something, Mr Zwane?  Say it?     Mr Seleka can I just interrupt you because I do not want to miss that and I am going back to something we dealt with before lunch, but I do not want to forget it.  I have been looking at the affidavit of Ms Elzabe Cornelia Rockman in the same, in this bundle, it starts at page 353.378.  What I am going to raise with you Mr Zwane and then we will go back to what Mr Seleka is dealing with.  Is your evidence that you only heard about the involvement of Estina in this project after you had left the Department of Agriculture.   You see Ms Rockman says she was the DirectorGeneral in the office of the Premier from September 2010 until 11 March 2013.  Now I am reading from paragraph 5 of her affidavit at page 353.379, and then she says in     H’m?     You do not recall?    Yes, you see, the interesting thing about this is this, that if contracts were presented at the Executive Council meeting of 13 June 12, those contracts could only have been between Estina and the department.  They could not have been contracts between Estina and Paras and therefore, if you were at that meeting, you would have become aware of Estina at that stage at the latest.      Yes, but remember that is not on myquestion.  My question is simply that, do you agree that if contracts relating to Vrede Dairy Project were presented to the Executive Council, then on what you know now, those contracts could only have been between Estina and the department, they would not have been a contract involving Paras.  Do you accept that that would have to be the case?     You see, Mr Thabetha’s evidence, if I recall correctly, was characterised by him talking about Paras being involved and being behind Estina or Paras having some arrangement or relationship with Estina at least at a certain stage he was talking along those lines during his evidence may have formulated what he was saying differently. But either at certain stage or throughout he was talking about there being a relationship between Estina and Paras but I think at some stage, the question was, wasthere a contract or agreement between the Department of Agriculture and Paras?  And if I recall correctly, none could be sure, there was an agreement between the department and Estina, you see.   So what I am suggesting to you, is that on what you know, now, it seems to me logical that you would agree that if contracts pertaining to the Vrede Dairy Project were presented at a meeting of the Provincial Executive Council on 13 June 2012.  That those contracts could not have been or have included any contract between thedepartment and Paras. On the contrary, they could only have related to the department and Estina.  Even though you say it was not normal to present contracts at Eskom meetings, but if indeed they were present on this occasion, for whatever reason, those could only be relating to Estina logically it seems to me.      Ms Rodman.     Ja, ja, you see - and then I moved from that page which is 353.381 to the next page in paragraph 2.2.5 Ms Rockman says the following.  You see, what we    Yes, yes, let me finish so that you can deal with everything.  What I want to suggest to you is that here are people in other offices other than the Department of Agriculture.   Mr Venter in the office of the Premier he has documents that come from your department, which talk about Estina being involved.  Here is, Ms Rockman who is Director General, in the office of the Premier is getting documents from Mr Venter talking about Estina in regard to this project. How would it be possible that you are the only one from whom this information about the involvement of Estinais withheld when everybody else is getting documents that mention Estina.     Yes, but you see, it goes back to what Iraised with you earlier on.  It should not be just what you are given by officials, you should also be asking for information to make sure that you know that things are under control and particularly if you talk about laying oversight, performing oversight functions but we have dealt with.  So I wanted to just - let me just mention I think two other parts or documents, you see at page 353.383 paragraph 2.27 Ms Rockman says, let me start at 2.2.6 which is at paragraph 353.382 she says;“I responded to Mr Venter that I had been informed that a meeting of the Treasury Committee was scheduled for 19 June 2012 on the matter of the Vrede Dairy Project.  Advocate Detierra[?] issued correspondence to the Chief Executive Officer of Provincial Treasury addressed to Ms Anna Fourie on 19 June 2012, making reference to a consultation between Provincial Treasury and legal services, legal services being office of the Premier, that took place on 18 June 2012 and suggested among others that, 3, it appears that the procurement process was not followed.  The contract may be invalid due to a number of reasons or we suggest that you propose to the Treasury Committee that the agreement and the procurement documents be sentto us for review.”    Ja    Ja he said that ja.    Let me – let me make sure you understand what I said about what Mr Thabethe said.  I said that I might not be putting it accurately but after lunch what I did say to you is that I am not sure whether throughout he was speaking like this but at some stage he was speaking on the basis that he understood Paras to be behind Estina. So in other words Mr Thabethe never said he did not know about Estina.  He knew about Estina but all he was saying is at least at a certain stage that his understanding was that there was some relationship between Estina and Paras but he may at some stage or I may have understood him to – to say this project was really between the Department of Agriculture and Paras but then there would be a time when you say butwhere is the contract between Paras and the department?  But he never said he did not know about Estina.    He had never said – he acknowledged that Estina was there.  So – so you are not even on the same level as him because you are saying you were not aware of Estina at all until after March 2013 whereas he knows the involvement of Estina from beginning to end.  It is a question of what was the role of Paras in this whole thing?  He does not say Estina was not known to him.     Ja.    Ja.    Okay you – you are not able to add – it is what you have said    Okay alright.  Mr Seleka I know I interrupted you but I think – I thought it was important.    And also to be fair to Mr Zwane if I pick up something.    To put it to him so that he could comment on it.    Yes okay.  Mr Seleka.    Were – were you ever told by Mr Thabethe or anybody where the money was going to come from to finance of fund this project?    Ja but the question is whether you were ever told by Mr Thabethe where the money would come from to fund this.  Did he say it was all going to come from the department?    Did you get to know or did you know at the time this is 2012 now how much the project was going to cost – what was the estimated cost of the project?   Which was going to be over R300 million.    That is right over three years.    Now in terms of where that amount of over R300 million was going to come did you have an understanding whether it was going to come- all come fromthe department including money that may be – that could be contributed from other provincial departments or did you have any under – or what understanding did you have?    So your understanding was that all the money to fund this project was going to come from the provincial government.    Yes.  Did you – did Mr Thabethe never tell you that the arrangement or agreement was that the entity that would be involved whether it was Paras or whatever was also going to put in – inject some money into the project – millions of rands into the project?    He never told you that    Could you be mistaken about this or you are sure he never told you?    Ja.    Yes.    But you – you do not recall.    Ja.    So Mr Seleka.    Well let us confirm with him.   Is your understanding correct?    Ja.    Ja.    Oh and so the…    The balance would come from other departments.    In the province.    The balance to make 84?    Oh okay – 30 plus.    Okay alright.  Yes okay.    Do you want to repeat to him what you say about that?    The 30 million.    The 30 million ja.    That is the Department’s officials you are talking about.   Ms Rothman.    Oh okay.      Okay let me see.    Ms Rothman’s   .381 okay.    Yes.      What paragraph are you reading from?    I am sorry 3.1?   Oh ja okay right.    He is saying his impression is that you were the one saying to your officials reprioritise in terms of budget.  So is his impression of your evidence correct or not?    But coming from you.    Or not coming from you because that is all he is asking.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, ja.    Yes.    Convey to him.   So can I take it that you – your answer is therefore that  1. You know that EXCO did give an instruction that the department should reprioritise. 2. You are not sure whether you did say to the HOD and the officials of the department that they should reprioritise but if you – if anybody says you did say you can understand that you would have said if necessarybecause that was the instruction of EXCO.    Okay.  Alright.      Let me – Mr Seleka I see that in putting in Ms Rothman’s affidavit into this bundle.    The annexures were not put in.    They may prove important.  Is it possible for somebody to quickly obtain those annexures because I am keen to look at some of them.    I do not know how many there are – I see there is one that says 50 but it is – it may be that they wereexcluded because they – it was not thought they might be material but I think they may be – or at least some of them maybe quite important.      If somebody can try and obtain them while we are continuing.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja, ja that should be easy to obtain.    Ja okay.    Ja if – if then copies can be made that can be slotted into everyone.  Now if there are too many it may be that it is necessary to look at them and see what is important.     I know what I am looking for so if I am given I can have a look.   Okay alright.  Let us continue.    But just from that Mr Zwane it seems that this project was being embarked upon without any proper planning – proper and adequate planning in terms of budget because if it had been properly planned and budgeted for you would not be having to reprioritise on the budget that has already been made for projects that had been there because when you reprioritise what it means as I understandit is some project or some things that had been allocated budget to say they will be done suddenly they will not be done because money is taken away from them in order for this project to be funded.  What do you say to the proposition that even that shows that the project had not been the subject of adequate and proper planning including budgetary planning?    But how would you know there would need to be a reprioritisation in circumstances where there are proper grounds of urgency.  Why – in other words, as to why the project cannot be subjected to proper and adequate planning first before it is implemented because this was in 2012.  The concept had been raised in 2011.  The agreements with – between the department and Estina were concluded in June/July.  Let us meet here,     I do not want you to speculate.     What do you – you are the MEC.  I want     Mr Seleka.     Mr Seleka, I know your challenge.     But I think we are going to have to find another day for Mr Zwane.       [laughs]     Mr Zwane ...[intervenes]      I am hoping you are not going to say    Ja.     H’m?     Ja, ja.     H’m.     No, no you have been cooperative.     Ja.     No, no you cooperate Mr Zwane.     You cooperate.     Yes?    Ja.     Ought to be the last day.     [laughs]     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Well, look – well, the one thing that is true that Mr Zwane is that you have been cooperating.  That cannot be taken away from you.  You – even at short notice, you have been cooperative.  You are here on a public holiday.  So whatever arrangements happen must not detract from the fact that we know you have beencooperating, okay?  That is the first point.The second point is.  Know that the Commission would never abuse your cooperation.  It would never do that.  Three.  Your – to the extent that you may wish to finish today, that is also understandable, okay.  As you know, I think we said – Mr Seleka said in the morning, we thought today would be the last day also.But part of the reason why, when there are some issues that have not been dealt with properly, one may think about another day.  It is really to be fair to allconcerned including you.  To say it might not be the best way of dealing with things.  To let you go and the issues being decided in circumstances where there is still a need for clarification on certain issues.So it is in good faith.  It is not to abuse.  But the point you make in terms of your cooperation and wishing this day to be the last one are legitimate points.  They are legitimate points.  It may well be that what we should do is.  Let us go up to five because we have another session, evening session.And what we can explore is whether whatever remains can be obtained from Mr Zwane by way of affidavits or not.  Maybe we could explore that.  So I just want you to understand Mr Zwane.  Nobody wants to abuse your cooperation.  Even those who do not cooperate withthe Commission, the Commission does not abuse them.  So you have been cooperating.  That must go to your credit.  So let us continue and see how far we go but the bottom line is, we do not want a situation where when decisions are made about what really the evidence     Yes, say something, ja.     Ja.    Ja, okay.     No, that is fine.     Ja.  Okay.       Yes, you did not know it then.  That there was no tender or ...[intervenes]      Okay.     Well, maybe you should say by whom?     Yes, he had said so Mr Seleka.     Ja.     Mr Seleka, just to looking at the question of how much still ...[intervenes]      ...remaining.  If I recall correctly.  The main matters on which the Commission wanted to hear Mr Zwane’s evidence was on Estina.     On his involvement in the trip to Switzerland.     And is relationship with the Guptas.     So was there – we did the trip toSwitzerland the last time.     We have done Estina.  I am not sure there is much left but you might have a better idea on Estina.     Ja.     Ja.    Ja.     Yes, ja.     Yes, ja.     Ja.     Yes.     No, no that is fine.  Well, we – I think, for example, when the banks closed how his role there.  That should not take long.    Ja, ja.     Okay let us continue.     Let us continue.  I am sure we can, whatever we have not covered by five ...[intervenes]      We may be able to cover by way of written questions and him answering by way of affidavit.    Ja.     You see, Mr Zwane, we are not unreasonable people.     Okay.  No, that is fine.     You did, yes, yes.     H’m?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, yes, yes.     That is fine.     Okay.  No, I think what we do in the light of what this latest discussion.     Let us – we can look at that later.     And if there are questions, they can be by way of written questions to Mr Zwane.     Ja.     Okay.  So we do not need to look at them now.     Oh, okay.    Okay.  [laughs]     H’m?     I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  I may just say so that your junior can hear me.     I would, nevertheless, like to see them this evening, the annexures.  Okay.     Alright.  Let us continue.     Even if my evening might start at eleven.  [laughs]     Okay alright.     Tony Gupta.     Ja.     Ja.     H’m.  So what you are saying is.  Youwere not friends with him?  But you interacted with him ...[intervenes]      ...to your work?     Okay.     [laughs] No, just continue.  I will ...[intervenes]      I will go – I will come in without the dropping(?) in if I need to.  [laughs]     And the date is 11 September 2014 and     So this is Ashu Bayi not Ashu Chawla.     Another name?    Oh, but is the same, it is Ashu Chawla.     Oh, that is what you [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Oh, okay.     Oh, okay, okay.  Continue?     Okay.     Thank you.     Yes, did you travel from South Africa to Dubai on Saturday 13 September 2015, Mr Zwane?    Yes, yes.     Oh, okay.     After today.     No, that is fine, that is important.  To theextent that you are able to respond, do so, but where you feel that you need to go and do some homework, check some records or whatever and maybe file an affidavit to respond, that will be allowed.     Yes, okay.     Ja, no, no.     Yes, ja.     No, thank you.     Okay.     No, that is fine, ja.     Yes, the documents.     Ja, ja.     No, no, that is fine.  I understand you to be saying the trip referred to in this ticket at page 353.135 did take place on the dates given and to the places indicated but you are saying it was an official trip.     And as far as your concerned, your knowledge is that – or assumption is that it was paid for by the department.     Which was Economic Development at the time.     Is that right?  And – but you have not had the opportunity of trying to obtain documents that might show the position and you will continue to try andobtain those.     Yes, yes.     Yes, okay.    Okay and therefore you are saying you never yourself communicated with these travel agents.     And asked them to make bookings.     And …[intervenes]     Ja.     Ja.  Ja.Okay, no, that is fine.  Arrangements when we stop, we will talk about when you could file – let us have an affidavit that might refer to whatever documents you are going to be able to get because, as you say, you would not get enough time to look at even the affidavit that you got yesterday.  So we will talk about that when we stop.     Thank you, Mr Zwane, that will be helpful.  Mr Seleka?     Ja, he will continue to try and see whether documents can be found.  I would say from the Commission’s side, the Commission should also try and find out.  So let us all try and find out what is there that can assist to establish what the position is.     Because what he is looking for are documents that may show that this too was an official trip.    Like the first one that we talked about in the morning, was an official trip and whether there would be documents that show that it was paid for by the department.     And whether now in the light of what we saw in the morning whether there are S & T  claim documents that show that her claimed for S & T  because it was an official trip.     So the legal team must also be in touch with the Economic Development department in the Free State to try and get that – I hope it is still called that because if the name has changed one could get lost as towhich one would have those records.  Do you know whether it is still called that, Mr Zwane?     Okay alright.  So I think you try from your side and the legal team will also try and obtain.  But from your side, we will fix the date, try and obtain and you will give us what you have obtained and the legal team, whatever it obtains, it must also share it with you.    Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?     Ja, you can refer to it, if you want to.     What page did you say it is?     261.5?     Ja – okay, yes, you refer to what you wish to refer to.     Well, no, it is fine, read the whole page.     Ja, it is important.     Ja, start from the beginning.     Ja, I have been saying Chawla, I think I have pronouncing it wrongly.  It must be Chawla.     Hey?  Chawla?     Oh, okay.  No, she must be right.     Okay.     Well, that might not be the only question. The other question is if Ms …[intervenes]     Allalla, Hallana.     Yes.  If she says, as she does, under oath, that she made these bookings for four people, including you, Mr Zwane, and she says – and there willsay, correctly so, she has never interacted with you.  She says she had never corresponded with you.  She says she has never met you.  She says, as I understand her, she got all this information from Mr Salim Essa.  In other words, it is Mr Salim Essa who said he must make bookings for the four people, including you, for this trip.   If that is true that Mr Salim Essa asked her to make the bookings which have related to, among others, you, the question is – and if it is accepted, as it should be, that you did travel on this date to the placed indicated in the ticket and came back on the day indicated there, how did Mr Salim Essa know this information about your trip or how did Ms Allana know this information so accurately without having spoken to you?  You see, those are the questions that arise and then, of course, the question who paid butapart from who paid, the question – there are these other questions.  How did she get to know you were going to travel to Dubai on such and such a day and from Dubai you were going to travel to India?  And, actually, that is where you travelled, that is where you went, and how did she know you would come back on the day on which you did come back without speaking to you?  She on her side says she got the information from Salim Essa. So those are the questions that arise.  But with regard to Mr Salim Essa, I think you said last time you didnot know him, is that correct?  You may have met him once or something or you did not know him at all?     If you want to answer all of them you can answer all of them.     Ja.  And I guess from your point of view if the department asked this travel agent to make a booking for you then that would have been between the travel agent and the department but, of course, she does not say that, she says it is Salim Essa but if that was the case, that would be the case.     Ja, ja, you just do not know, ja.     Ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka?    Take us there.     Ja, take us there.     Writing to Mr Ashu Chawla?     Ja.     And she says    Yes.     Maybe let me ask this question, do youknow whether Tony Gupta was on the plane, on the same plane as yourself when you went on that trip from South Africa to Dubai?  At least you had met him by that time as I understand it.     Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka?     The next page is page 353.261 what?     Okay.     H’m.     Let’s start with this, you accept that the destinations are the same, the places where you went? MR     Yes according to this.     But in terms of your recollection of your own trip as well you have said that from here you went toDubai, from Dubai you went to India, from India did you go back to Dubai?     That is the route ja.  And do you remember whether you went to Zurich or not?     You did go to Zurich ja.  And from Zurich back to Dubai.     And then back home from Zurich straight or from Zurich back to Dubai?     Oh, first went to Dubai then to South Africa.    Okay.      No, no, no, that is fine ja, no that’s fine, ja.     Yes..    Ja.     You have checked it is the same?     Ja, ja.  And the flight is it the same flight?     H’m.     Okay, okay we can always check and when you have time you will also have a look and to see whether they flew according to this on the same flights as yourself and then you will then deal with the issues in an affidavit that you will file and if you, by then we will haveseen some documents which you think are important could be for the Commission you will do so.      No, that is fine, ja, thank you.     I think we must stop here because we have reached five o’clock.     So the arrangement therefore is that further questions can be put to Mr Zwane in writing and he will respond by way of affidavit but even before he receives any questions he has got some homework to do to see what he can get in terms of documents that throws light onthe issues and the legal team will themselves also approach the Economic Department of the Free State Province, to try and see what information the documents can be obtained.   Today is the – what is the date today?     13 t h.     Of May, if we say try and let us have the affidavit by 25 May do you think that will give you enough time Mr Zwane?    You will do your best.        Ja, or maybe I just say on or before the – Monday is 31 May, 29 will be, 30 will be Sunday, Saturday will be 29, on or before Friday the 28 t h, or let me give you more time.     No, no I am saying that’s fine, because you are still going to put questions to him, remember, we will give him that.   Your attorney is fine with that?     Yes, okay, we will give you enough time,and – but in the meantime you I think try and make sure  you have given him questions by when?     By this weekend?     Oh okay, alright, okay alright, and then he will – the affidavit will deal with everything, okay, alright.Thank you very much Mr Zwane for your cooperation and thank you to your attorney also, Mr Dendafor your cooperation, thank you.      Thank you very much Mr Zwane.  We will adjourn this day session now for 15 minutes and thereafter we will resume and start the evening session and that will relate to Mr Koko’s evidence, is that right?     Ja, in regard to Eskom.  We adjourn.     Once again good afternoon Mr Seleka,good afternoon everybody.     Good afternoon, are you read?     Yes.     Yes, please administer the oath or affirmation.     Thank you.  Yes, let us continue.     Okay, page 811.112 in Bundle, Eskom Bundle 14.  Eskom Bundle 14, page 811.112.     Sorry, before you proceed Mr Koko, the December that you talk about in terms of when the award was made is ...[intervenes]      Okay.     Ja, the writing was on the wall was mentioned around February/March or something.     Or March/April.     That appears on ...[intervenes]      Oh okay, well I recently asked them whether they have got what I simply called the document that should tell me who had what responsibilities or obligations in the processing of invoices and they assured me that they have got that.  So that may or may not necessarily be what you are talking about but I am just saying I have just been calling on that, but I think they have got everything now, or is it – Mr Seleka?     You do ja.     Okay do let me have copies, I don’t know if they are already here in advance because I do want to look at those documents.    There is no contract?     Oh, that you can’t pay ja.     Ja, you made the point last time I think, at least the approach of Eskom is that if there is a contract but there was some irregularity as long as the outside, the other party has ...[intervenes]      ...satisfactorily then they should be paid and then Eskom can deal internally with its own officials who may  not have done what they were supposed to do.     Okay, okay.     Ja.     Why people, what is the [laughing]     You must go and say ...[indistinct] and they decide how to deal with you?     Ja.     Okay, I think it might be – that might be a very fair approach in the sense that if the other party to the contract acted in good faith then – and it has done its party, it has performed the work, they get paid because sometimes when just because of some irregularity and sometimes no matter how small the irregularity then a party refuses to pay yet the other party has performed, maybe spent money to perform as well, it can be quite unfair sometimes.     Was party to the irregularity.     Ja, no, no, that is fine.   Well Mr – we will let Mr Seleka ...[intervenes]      Oh he is going to deal with it now.     Ja okay.     You can reach for the file if you want to.     Okay, okay, right.     Okay.     Yes, yes okay.     H’m.    But let’s start with what is it that we are looking for, because if Mr Koko says this policy says in fact the mere fact that a contract is irregular doesn’t mean thatEskom must withhold payment to the other particular contract even though the other particular contract has acted in good faith and has performed to the satisfaction of Eskom, unless you say no that is not what it says, I don’t need to look at it now, I can look at it later.     And he goes on to say he says Eskom must pay if the other party has acted in good faith and they have performed their side of the bargain to Eskom’s satisfaction, so if that is uncontested we don’t need to really go there, I can look at it later, but if it’s contested then I will look at it.     Yes.     Okay.     Is that ...[indistinct]?     Okay.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.     Well an irregularity I guess depending on the circumstances could go to process, it could go to substance, it would depend, I don’t know here, but I don’t think all irregularities just go to procedure or process, I think some might go to process.     Okay.     Ja.     Yes.  So there needs to be condonation first, then there could be payment?     Well if you say they are important maybe we should ...[intervenes]      Ja.     The irregular procurement must be dealt with as follows, involving three separate but simultaneous steps.     Okay, continue.     What are you relying on to say that?  What qualifies it?     Unless?     The qualification you are talking about the one based on that part of the page where it says to the extent that Eskom – that says it is required to approve the payment to supply against a valid invoice and to the extent that Eskom has a valid contractual obligation to pay for the excess goods or services.    And of course – ja – is it – that is the one.   Yes.  But …    Well – well you see ordinarily is the position not that between two contracting parties if there has been non-compliance with something in terms of a contract or non-compliance with whatever else in certain circumstances the party who otherwise would be able to rely on the non-compliance not to perform his or her part can waive that for whatever reasons or condone that – that wouldbe within their – their power.  If they want to take the point they take the point and of course there can be litigation after that.   And of course if the one party has already performed then issues of unjust enrichment and all of those things at common law would arise but in recent times is the position not that we have seen particularly with regard to contracts, tenders and so on involving government departments and SOE’s where even if the contractors declared by court to be unlawful the court would nevertheless say what would be just and equitable in the circumstances.   You might recall the cash pay master contract and the decision of the constitutional court in regard to that. So where it is accepted it the contract was unlawful but nevertheless to say at a practical level if we just say itwas unlawful that is the end of everything it might work out an injustice on the other party or on a party as in the case of the cash pay master services that related to social grants it could affect innocent people you know.   So the court says it was unlawful but for a certain period of time we will un – accept – we will allow this unlawful contract to be continued with and for – to be dealt with as if it was lawful.  So one has those things.    But those are legal issues.   Those are legal issues.    Which one maybe could leave until later.    But from your side you can obviously as you – what you believe you want to pursue – to explore all options – all I am simply saying is…    The – it may be that to the extent that Eskom may have taken the approach that just because there is an irregularity does not mean we will never pay.  We will check whether the other party has acted in good faith. We will check whether the other party has performed its part to our satisfaction and if it acted in good faith and it hasperformed its part of the deal in good faith to our satisfaction we will pay and deal with our own employees or officials in terms of the irregularity as a way of being fair because we have benefitted from their services.  So – so – but I think maybe something that can be looked at.    At – at later but you might wish to say something before we move on.    Deal with it some other time.    But generally speaking my impression is that if you are supposed to follow a procedure or if the procedure was legally binding and you do not follow it thatshould result in a negative.  If it is a procedure where that was not legally binding that might be different.  So – but let us move on.    And – but you can then explore whatever you wish to explore.    Mr Koko you do not – you cannot resist.    No, no, no your counsel will be able to make an input.   But – ja – say something.  Ja say something ja.    Ja.    No, no you can say something.    2015.    Ja.    March – February/March 2016 yes.    You must wait until he says so otherwise you could spend a lot of time on the – only to find that he is (talking over one another).    But when he does say you can deal with it.    2015    2016   Ja okay.    Ja.    Okay.    Ja no that is fine.  Mr Seleka.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    No that is fine.  That is fine.  Okay let us continue Mr Seleka.    Page 811.8170.    I am sorry 811.170   Of Eskom Bundle 14.    Have you got it.    Okay.    Okay.    When you came back.    On the 23rd October.    They moved out of your…    Oh out of your life.    Ja.    Ja.  Okay.    So – I am sorry just to – to get final clarification.  Would that mean that those people who werereporting to the finance department or the CFO when – during the restructuring.  Does that mean that before your suspension they were reporting to you.    Okay. MR    So something happened while you were on suspension.    They began restructuring.    When you came back some of the people that had been reporting to you before suspension were now reporting to the CFO and that restructuring continued until the 23r d when it was completed.    Ja okay.    For a straight question.    No.    Ja no that is fine.    Point 168?    Okay.  Yes.    Okay.    Oh okay.    Ja okay.    Yes I remember you made the point last time.    Okay.    Okay.      Mr Seleka    Just remind me what are the topics that still remain to be dealt with in Mr Koko’s evidence?    At the moment it is transactions that you are dealing with.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja. Ja.  No that is fine I just wanted to have an idea.    So we are busy with McKinsey.    And then there is the issue of the travelling.    And then it is Tegeta.    Okay.  No that is alright.  Continue.    Okay.    Alright.    Well Mr Koko is following his counsel’s advice.    Ja.    On Instruction 3 or Section3.?    Okay.    Sorry.    Ja.  No, no, no the one thing that I have noticed is that you read Mr Koko – you read these documents and you know where – what is what.   Ja.    20 July    You said you sent an email to?    The Chairman.    Ja okay.     So is your answer that    Ja.     Ja, okay.     Ja.     H’m.  Okay.     Remember you were saying, when you were giving evidence at some stage, that you raised I think the issue with him and you said you listened to you very attentively ...[intervenes]     And once he saw your point, he ran with it.     Okay.     Ja, okay.     H’m?     But that does not necessarily mean he did not send an email to him or ...[intervenes]   Or discussed with him as the chairperson of the whole board.      Yes.     H’m.     Yes.     What you may wish to do Mr Seleka ...[intervenes]      Ja, ...[intervenes]      what you may wish to do if there is an issue about what Mr Koko may have said or did not say in his evidence about his discussion with Mr Ngubane or theemail would be that maybe your junior look it up, check that.  If necessary, Mr Koko is coming back on Monday, is it not?     Yes.  That can be ...[intervenes]    ...clarified on Monday.  Or even by way of a written ...[intervenes]      Ja, okay alright.     So maybe your junior can make a note and it can be sorted out on Monday.  In the meantime, she can look it up.     So that we make progress, ka.     What is the page?    So you say when the mandate was originally given, the value was zero?     But later on, there was this amount of R 475 million ...[intervenes]      ...and that was ratified later?     Ye.     H’m.     Yes.     H’m?     Whereabout are you reading from it – point 39?     The one starting with ...[intervenes]      ...McKinsey has not accepted.     Oh, okay alright.  Okay continue.    Is maintained for Eskom, hey?     H’m.     Well, remember what your counsel said?  Straight answer.  Yes or no?     Okay, alright.  [laughs]     Ja.     Ja.     H’m?     Yes.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja-no, that is fine.       Mr Seleka.     Is that point 40?     H’m?     I am sorry, I am sorry.  I thought you were already reading on page – point 40, were you not?     You... reading there yet.     H’m?     Yes.     It is just that you said on the next page.  So ...[intervenes]      ...for me that was the page we were on.     Ja, okay.     H’m?     Yes?     The process is currently in progress.     Ja.     Okay.  Now, Mr Seleka, I thought you were not so convinced that there was ratification as Mr Koko said.  So I thought you were taken us or are we on our way there?     Ja, I know you have said that but I...[intervenes]      But I thought Mr Koko was saying – was kind of questioning whether the ratification was for that or something like that.     Well, the way you lost me, it looks I may have misunderstood you Mr Seleka.     The ratification of 475?     H’m.     Ja.  You remember whether you were questioning that or not?     Oh.     Okay, alright.     For the sake of completeness.  Can you tell me – can you show me Mr Koko where the ratificationis?     Of the BTC?     Look, if you do not find it immediately, it is fine.  I thought you might just ...[intervenes]      Ja, there are minutes that I see at page 830 but that must be the board because I see it was checked by Dr Ngubane.  No, it is fine.  We can find it ...[intervenes]      Okay no that is fine.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.    Ja.     Ja, okay.     Okay.     Let us continue then.  If he has found it, you can have a look quickly.       Ja, do not worry.  We will find them the minutes ...[intervenes]      Ja.     H’m.  Okay let us continue.  We will see after the break.     Ja.    Well, Mr Koko ...[intervenes]      I do not know what exactly you are talking about but to the extent that you are talking about this document that we are dealing with and the fact that you signed it at page 829.44.  There is nothing I see on this document or even next to your signature that suggests that you signed it or any reason other different from the reason why the others signed it.  Because the last paragraph is 4 and the heading to 4 is Recommendation     Ja?     Ja.     H’m?    You have no problem with that?     Ja.     Yes, okay.     Okay.     But you see what you are saying may well be so if you say not necessarily in terms of what is written in this document but in – on the basis of what is written in Eskom policies or regulations.     To say, in terms of those internal documents, when I was the Group Executive signs any document such as this, I am not signing to say I go along with what they are saying in substance.     I am signing to say there has been compliance with A, B, C.     Which, of course, I will not know.     Ja.     Ja, h’m.     No, no.  I understand  I think what should happen in that situation is that something should be written to indicate that that is what you are signing for     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     H’m.  Okay.     Ja.     Ja.     Okay no that is fine.     Mr Seleka.     Just repeat that Mr Seleka. ADV SELEKA     Repeat from the question, from the beginning.  I have missed it.     H’m?     Mr Seleka?    Okay.    Ja.     Well, the Matshela Koko who appears in that picture does not look very much like the one in front of me.     The fault must be with whoever took thepicture.  Yes.     Mr Seleka?     Mr Barry?    Mr Seleka?     He is nodding?     I am sorry.     Is that so?     Okay, maybe they were not passed on toMr Barrie.  Ja.     Okay, okay, so maybe that is what happened.     Okay, alright.     Yes, okay, alright.     Hang on one second, what I wanted totry and remember…     Is whether, Mr Koko, you accepted that you received those emails but did not respond or whether you disputed that they were sent to you.     Yes.     Well, except that if she says she met with you when you know – when you knew you did not meet with her you could respond and say what are you talking about, I never met with you.     Ja.     But the point that I am putting to you is that if you knew that you did not meet with her and you receive an email from her saying that she met with you anddiscussed those topics with you that would be all the more reason why, if you did receive such an email from her, it would be necessary to write back and say what are you talking about?  I never met with you.     Ja.     No, no, except, of course, that if there are matters that are raised that happened while I was there and he or she was to verify whether that is actually the position, that person can ask me or refer and say I want to respond this but it happened during your time, what is the position?  And then I can say I never had a meeting with that person.  That part you understand?     No, no…[intervenes]     But is the position not that even though you may have moved out of one position or department toanother you still use the same email address and therefore the emails would still have come to you if they were sent to you?     Mr Seleka?     Yes, well, yes, if the emails say that is what you met to discuss on a particular occasion it would be the author of the emails.     I am sorry.  Do you want him to read the previous one?     Because you want to listen to it properly?     Read it, Mr Seleka.     Well, Mr Seleka, I think he wanted to refer, as I understand it, to refer to the fact that she says she met with you.      But I think he wants to go to another one, I do not know whether that is the one.     Ja, okay.     Mr Seleka?     Never gave me?     Mr Seleka?     Well, did Ms Mothepu say that she discussed the topics that Mr Koko says were neverdiscussed with him?  Did she say in her evidence or any email she discussed those topics with him?  Let us get that clear.     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka?     Ja, ja.     Mr Seleka?     Okay.     Ja.    Well, the Matshela Koko who appears in that picture does not look very much like the one in front ofme.     The fault must be with whoever took the picture.  Yes.     Mr Seleka?     Mr Barry?     Mr Seleka?     He is nodding?     I am sorry.     Is that so?     Okay, maybe they were not passed on to Mr Barrie.  Ja.     Okay, okay, so maybe that is what happened.     Okay, alright.     Yes, okay, alright.     Hang on one second, what I wanted to try and remember…     Is whether, Mr Koko, you accepted that you received those emails but did not respond or whether you disputed that they were sent to you.     Yes.     Well, except that if she says she met with you when you know – when you knew you did not meet with her you could respond and say what are you talking about, I never met with you.     Ja.     But the point that I am putting to you is that if you knew that you did not meet with her and you receive an email from her saying that she met with you and discussed those topics with you that would be all the more reason why, if you did receive such an email from her, it would be necessary to write back and say what are you talking about?  I never met with you.     Ja.

No, no…[intervenes]     But is the position not that even though you may have moved out of one position or department to another you still use the same email address and therefore the emails would still have come to you if they were sent to you?     Mr Seleka?     Yes, well, yes, if the emails say that is what you met to discuss on a particular occasion it would be the author of the emails.     I am sorry.  Do you want him to read the previous one?     Because you want to listen to it properly?     Read it, Mr Seleka.     Well, Mr Seleka, I think he wanted to refer, as I understand it, to refer to the fact that she says she met with you.      But I think he wants to go to another one, I do not know whether that is the one.     Ja, okay.     Mr Seleka?     Never gave me?     Mr Seleka?     Well, did Ms Mothepu say that she discussed the topics that Mr Koko says were never discussed with him?  Did she say in her evidence or any email she discussed those topics with him?  Let us get that clear.     Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka?     Ja.     No that is fine, because I am trying to make sure we don’t spend too much time on something that might not be an issue.     Ja.     H’m okay.   Mr Seleka?     Ja, but if it doesn’t say what is in issue why do you read it, because as I understand it, one, Mr Koko doesn’t deny that he had interactions with Ms Matshepo and that they even met.    All he is saying the two of them never discussed this specific, those particular issues, so if whatever email doesn’t say they discussed those issues, I am not sure whether you need to read it.     H’m.      Ja.  Mr Seleka?     Tell me first what it says before ...[intervenes]      It is addressed to Mr Koko?     Okay tell us where to find it and ...[intervenes]      Where do you find it first?  What bundle?    Ja, and what page?     811.256     Well it is an email from Masilo Matshepo to Mr Kokomm@eskom.co.za Mr Eric Wood is copied, the subject is Eskom initiatives, the email was 5 December     Okay, of course it doesn’t say there discussed, but it clearly is an email that from her side she contemplates could be a subject of a discussion if Mr Koko wished that.     So that is a different email? ADV SELEKA     It must be different because this one is five to seven.     Ja, but do we know whether that one of the 5 t h talks about discussing, that they discussed those topics?     Of the 7 t h.     Ja.     I think they  might not have that intent, this is where – ja.     Ja.     That’s not the one of the 5 t h of December because that’s ten past nine.     H’m.     He had made?     Ja, ja.     Ja, that is the one I was asking about ja.     H’m.     Ja, no, no, that’s – but Mr Koko we talk about ones that he is alleged to have made.     Okay, have you got the 7 t h December one.     Okay, let’s look at the – in the ...[intervenes]      ...email.     278?     Yes.     And that of course is an update fromTrillian.     Or Regiments.     Whatever.     And not one made by Mr Koko.     Hang on don’t speak at the same time.   Mr Seleka.     Yes, from Ms Matshepo’s side?     Okay Mr Koko?     H’m.     What does it mean?     You can’t translate it. Okay [laughing] but the actual ...[intervenes]      No before that, here is an email that maybe ...[indistinct] to what Mr Seleka seems to be lookingfor, same bundle, page 811.303, it is an email from Ms Matshepo to you Mr Koko, subject is updated proposal an     But I think to say the least what some of the emails suggest is that she wanted to discuss ...[intervenes]      Ja, reading from what?     [laughing]     Okay just read ...[intervenes]      Just read it.    Ja, okay.     Ja, but you say there was no discussion ...[intervenes] .     On the topics.     Okay.    Ja, ja.  Okay, we have finished two hours, let’s take a ten minutes adjournment and then depending on what you have Mr Seleka maybe we should make progress and move on.     Ja.     When we come back.     What did you want to ...[intervenes]      Yes, ja.    H’m.     Just repeat what transcript this is on, so it can be checked.     Right.     Ja.     Ja, when ...[intervenes]      You remember when I read that email I said when she talked about the meeting at two I said I don’t know whether she meant a meeting with Mr Koko or with somebody else.     But is it true that from her evidence it appears that she met with the technical team?     Is that correct Mr Seleka?     Okay let’s take the adjournment and then I think when we come back let’s try and make some progress.     Ja, okay.  We will adjourn for ten minutes.  We adjourn.     Okay let’s continue.     Which ones are we putting aside?     So we just need to do the best we can to make progress, tomorrow we must finish, not tomorrow Monday     On Monday, Mr Koko is still looking for the right file, in fact bundle 16?     16[b].  What about this one that you have got this side of your desk, is it not that one?  Will somebody help ...[intervenes]      Ja.    Please remind Mr Seleka what is the point about all of these?     And ...[indistinct] if he was involved in it and then what?     And of course he was not in the finance department.    You would need the finance department for that.     You need people in that department.     Why would you accept if he says I wasn’t involved in finance?     So what is the point about them?ADV SELEKA SC  Yes there is Duvah insurance, Mr Koko said he is not part of the Master Services Agreement.     Ja.     No issue there.     There would be no need for another group executive?     Ja.     Of the CFO?     And you are not one of them?     They are finance people, you are not a finance person.     Yes Mr Seleka.     Mr Seleka I come back to my point, reference to these pages is meant to prove what point, or is relevant to what point?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.    But why didn’t you go straight to the one at 11.23 which has got as I understand it the – that ...[indistinct] because we have been going through almost page by page and if the issue is that this Duvah issue that is at 11.23.     Yes, you see to the extent that you weresaying this committee made certain decisions or was discussions certain issues knowing that there had been no approval from National Treasury that I understand, but that shouldn’t take long because the – Mr Koko doesn’t dispute that there was no approval from National Treasury.     So but the one about the Duvah what is the point about it, other than according to Ms Matshepo it was added, was it – was ...[indistinct] why should we spend so much time trying to establish whether Mr Kokowas involved in any discussions concerning it?     Yes but you don’t to follow spend too much time on everything Mr Koko denies because some of it might not be important, so that is why I am asking what is the significance of this Duvah element and whether Mr Koko discussed it, was involved in any discussions on it, where does it take us? ADV SELEKA     No, no I understand that, all I am simply saying is if it is nothing important we shouldn’t spend toomuch time on it, let’s spend time on what you know is important, so that is why I am asking, I was asking why – what is the significance of whether or not Mr Koko was involved in discussions of the Duvah issue.     No, no I haven’t heard why it is significant other than putting one witness version to another.     Ja, but we can leave them hanging if they are not important, what would not be right is to leave hanging those that are important.  Those that are not important we can leave them hanging otherwise when we have four hours we can spend three hours on those that are not important instead of spending three hours on the important ones.  So I am just checking because I am not sure that I appreciate why you are spending so much time on it.     Okay, alright.     Ja.     No let us identify those important issues and then let’s spend time on those.     Because we don’t have time.     Okay let us continue.     H’m.     Okay no that is fine.     But this would have been 2015?     2016.    So it was before the writing was on the wall?     Okay.  Okay, alright.So – yes let’s ...[intervenes]      H’m, okay.    That’s fine.  Mr Seleka?     Let’s continue.     Hang on, hang on, now Mr Seleka just go according to your plan.  If you were going to reach that issue sometime later you will deal with it when you reach it.     Okay [laughing]     Okay, okay, alright ...[intervenes]      Okay this is what we must do, let’scontinue now, tomorrow when – not tomorrow – Monday before we start the two of you will have reflected on exactly that and then if there is something to be cleared it can be cleared when we start on Monday, okay, let’s continue.          But in terms of the way forward what you still need to deal with Mr Seleka just tell me what those matters are and then so that maybe you can tell me what exactly is important to be covered.    Okay, continue then.     Well isn’t the position that Mr Koko has addressed these in an affidavit?     You have not addressed this?     Oh, okay, no that’s fine, if he hasn’t then you can read, okay.    I thought if he had addressed on it then you could just ask the relevant questions without reading but if he hasn’t you can read.     On a lighter note, I was wondering why Mr Koko  you didn’t respond to this on an affidavit because you do read a lot and  you write a lot.      Okay.    Okay, alright.     You did what?     That is fine.     Ja, no that is alright.   Mr Seleka continue.    Sorry Mr Seleka, didn’t we deal with this, why do I think, have a recollection of Mr Koko dealing with the trips which were booked in December and he cameback in January.     H’m.     Okay, I just don’t want us to repeat what we have done.     Oh, okay, alright.     Yes. Okay.     Okay, continue Mr Seleka.     Well let us start with the most important thing. Did this trip take place?     On the dates that are applicable?     You left South Africa on the date givenand you came back to South Africa on the date given?     And you went to the places that she says you went to?     Okay alright, then you can talk about the other things, who paid and so on, and who made bookings, at least those important things are covered, the trip did happen and on the dates given and to the places that are given.    Let’s – and she says it was Mr Essa or his secretary who asked her to make the bookings, is that right?     Yes, Mr Koko just tell your side of the story with regards to your knowledge who made thebookings for your travelling and who paid and so on.  Who was supposed to have something to do with it and who was not supposed to have something to do with it.    What page is it Mr Seleka?    Point 9   Okay I have got that.  The travel agent there is Thompsons is that right?    Yes I found it.    How many kids?    Ja okay.    Hang on I am still at Point 59.   I do not see the destination.    Oh is it in the next page.  23 December     63.    Yes there is an email there.    Okay it is addressed to you and those you    Ja.  Okay and in terms of that booking you were to arrive back in Johannesburg on 5 January 2016 at five to nine in the morning.  Yes.  And this I would take it coincides substantially if not exactly the same as the travel arrangements made by Travel Excellence or not exactly?   This is Thompsons that I know.    Yes.    No, no remember I asked you when we were still on the affidavit of the travel of Ms Alana    Ja when we were dealing with the affidavit I asked you whether..    Sulliman ja.    I asked you – hang on.  I asked youwhether you took the trip on the dates given by her to the destinations given by her and you said yes.  So we must – if that is correct in regard to her it must be correct in regard to this.  That is what I am talking about.    Ja.    Yes no no – ja.    Yes, ja, ja.   No, no we are talking about Sulliman ja.  But those – this information from Thompsons what I am saying is in accordance with what you agreed to.    When I was.    When we were talking about Suleiman’s affidavit.    Ja.    Yes, no, no this one is Thompsons.   Ja no, that is fine.    Ja.    Is that separate – is that separate from the bundle?    New    Ja.    Okay.    Yes okay that is fine yes.    Ja.    No that is good ja.    Yes they will be marked in due course.    Yes.    Yes.  But I can – I can – they can be given to me to see for now and then …    Ja.   Ja.  We – I see the first document and these documents will be in a bundle that will handed – and handed up at some other time.  The first document in front of me is from Kgomotso Koko sent to Desdifano Vanessa    Ja no I forgot that.  I should start with the one at the bottom.  So that one is from Vanessa to Kgomotso and it says – it is dated 3 March 2021 at five past one.  It is to – it is from Destifano Vanessa to Kgomotso Koko and the subject is Invoice and proof of payment request. “Hi Kgomotso I can find history of two deposits to us from FNB 17 November R113 000.00, 25 November R270 800.00 hope this helps you.  Regards Vanessa.” And then Kgomotso responds on the same day a few minuteslater I think. “Hi Vanessa thank you, thank you greatly appreciate it so there is no way to find the actual deposits – are you able to see the branch it was made from at least?” The next document starting from the bottom is from Vanessa Destifano to Kgomotso. “Can I have your contact number please as the below is not making any sense to me.” And then Kgomotso to Vanessa. “I will appreciate the call” And gives the number.  And then the next one is – there is an email from Vanessa Destifano to Kgomotso. “Sorry I do not what is it that you need this for as I am honestly concerned that we willnot be able to help you we do not keep information for longer than five years (mumbling) at all.” And then Kgomotso writes to Vanessa. “Hi Vanessa I am sure you have bank statements for November/December 2015.  Can you kindly use my reference to check    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.   Okay let me see.  Yes Registrar.    This no – Thank you.  Which one is it?    Document number what from the top?    It is the last one.    Okay.  Yes I have got it.      Yes.    To Terry Gunther.   Yes.    It is dated 14 December 2015.  It is sent    That is 14 December.    The visas.    Ja okay.    But is that still under the trip?    Okay.    Okay alright.    Okay.    Hm.    Shaheed.    Okay.    Ja there is a letter Shannon Little Attorneys.  There is the letters two pages and then there is – do you want me to go to the last page?    Well the last page is Travel Excellence – just tell me –     Ja but it must – ja it could be on the previous page is it not.    Ja tell me.   Ja tell me about it.  Only the relevant parts.    I am sorry.  You are – okay I see whereyou are.  Ja that is from     Sameera Sulliman.    She is writing to   Salim Essa.    And she says   Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    So – so you say you got them through your interaction with Mr Salim Essa’s lawyers.    In regard to the SIU.    Investigation.    I wish that Mr Salim Essa could make himself available to the commission.  Because his lawyers wrote to the commission and said he was complaining that he was beingdefamed in the commission and the commission wrote to them and said where is he?  Could you give us – can you give us an undertaking that if we allocate a date for him to come and appear before the commission he will come?  And I am told there has been no answer to this.    Ja.    Ja we want him – we want him to come andexplain things and you know all kinds of things have been said about him he could explain to the nation what happened.    Yes.    Contract attorneys.    Okay that – that I guess we will get – we have got to     You do not know I need to – okay alright.    Ja.    Yes.    Ja.    Was for ja.   Ja.    I am sorry what page?    That is point 58.    58    Yes right.   Right I am there.    But also the – the date when that is received is 20 January 2016 it seems to me not 18.  But that is a receipt at the office and did she not say the cash wasdelivered to her house?    And it was – and the receipt – did she say she took it to the bank or to the office?    Mr Seleka what is your recollection?    Yes. Okay.   “And indicated the reference as SE Essa”    Ja.      505.     H’m?     H’m?     H’m?     H’m?     H’m?     Well, what is – what needs to be looked at is that we have travel agents – agencies, Thompsons and Travel Excellence.     H’m?     They both seem to claim to have made bookings.  I know that there was – there is a portion of the – one of the affidavits from travel agents which seemed tosay there is a part of a lack of the trip that they did not make bookings for but they say they made bookings for the others.       Yes.  So we have got two travel agents.So the first thing is to see whether there is actual conflict in terms of the versions and it on the face of it, it does appear to be so.  But the one thing, Mr Koko, that would be very interesting is to the extent that you had never used Travel Excellence.  You had never interacted with either Ms Alana or Ms Suliman.  There is the question of how they would have come to know about your trip and when and what time you would leave for what destination and come back in what flight if, one, the position, as you put it, as I understand itthat you had never had anything to do with them.  And two, if nobody had told them about those details, they say or one of them says Mr Salim Essa told them about it or his secretary.  What do you say about that? Are you able to say anything?     H’m?     That part you accept, that they did that?     Ja.     Ja.     Ja, h’m.     Ja.     Ja.     Ja, h’m.    H’m, h’m.     So.  But you say from you side you had instructed her to deal with Thompsons?     Yes.     Yes.     Had she dealt with Thompsons at your instance in regard to anything before or she had not?     H’m?    H’m, h’m.     So you have no recollection whether she might have dealt with Thompsons Travel Agents at her(?) instance out of this?     You are not...  Ja, okay.     Alright.    Okay alright.     So is your evidence that, one, in regard to this part of the leg or this leg of the trip from Indonesia ...[intervenes]     ...to Dubai, she is the one who asked – who must have asked Travel ...[intervenes]      ...Travel Excellence ...[intervenes]    ...to make bookings for you?     And that she is the one also who decided in regard to the visas to use Travel Excellence ...[intervenes]      ...without your knowledge?     H’m?     Yes.     But why would you think she would go to Travel Excellence when she knows you wanted her to use Thompsons?  Because it is not like – it would be different     And in regard to her having, probably,because I think that is what you are saying, probably approached Travel Excellence whether directly or through Salim Essa ...[intervenes]      Ja, ja.  When did you discover that actually that leg of your trip had been booked for by Travel Excellence?     Ja.  Soon after ...[intervenes]      After coming back?     Oh, much later?     2018?     Yes.     Yes.  And how did it come about that you found out?     Well...  And then, did you contact her     Ja.     Okay alright.  Now, Ms Suliman says she was asked by either Mr Salim Essa or his secretary ...[intervenes]      Or his - Mr Salim Essa’s secretary to make bookings for you.     Ja, and the – well, I did not remember about the visas in terms of her but yes, okay.  And you –     Yes ...[intervenes]      But to – we have gone further because you have said this must have happened in this way.  Ms Daniels must have spoken to Salim Essa and Salim Essa must have spoken to Travel Excellence ...[intervenes]      So to an extent and maybe it is a limited extent, the two versions fit in there although it comes from different angles.     [laughs]     Because in regard to that part of the leg, then Ms Suliman must be correct to say either Mr Essa or Mr Essa’s secretary spoke to me and – in regard to that part of the trip.     Ja, ja, ja.     Ja, ja.     Ja, you accept that.     That part is not a problem.     Ja, ja.     No, that is fine.  We are at about twelve minutes past nine.     We did not talk about when we wouldstop.     But I think we should stop and then on Monday we can continue.  On other times, I would go – I would be prepared to go further but I have got to – I think we should stop now.  And then on Monday we try and finish.  I do not know whether Mr Seleka you had to or three questions you wanted to put in regard to this before we adjourn or you – they can wait until Monday?     They can wait?     Okay alright.     Then it is fine.  But before we adjourn, I want to raise something and I want mister – to hear what Mr Barrie might say about it, if it is something that he would want to respond to only on Monday, that is fine.  I do not know, Mr Barrie, whether, one – once Mr Seleka has finished questioning Mr Koko you wish to re-examine, number one.  Number two.  If you wish to re-examine, I do not know what you have in mind as to how long it might take.  But having said that, I want to say either if Mr Seleka endsup using all the time on Monday or uses most of the time and the time that is left is not enough for you to finish, I have begun to say to legal representatives of persons who wish to re-examine that maybe they could consider whether in the place of oral re-examination, they would be comfortable with filing an affidavit after the evidence leader has finished to question the witness.  Within an agreed period, filing an affidavit which clarifies all the issues that they would have wished to clarify.  Some have said that is fine but obviously it depends on each legal representative.  But that is simply because of the time constraints.  So I do not know whether you wish to think about it or is there something that you want to say something? ADV     Ja.     Ja.     Ja.     Considerable.     Ja.  [laughs]  No, that is alright.  That is alright.     Yes.     Yes.  No, thank you  Thank you, thankyou.  Okay we are going to adjourn for today.  For the benefit of the public.  Tomorrow I will be hearing witnesses who will give evidence in connection with the State Security Agency.  Mr Koko will resume his evidence on Monday, the evening session. But I want to thank you Mr Seleka and your team.  I want to thank the investigation team.  I want to thank you Mr Koko.  I want to thank Mr Barrie and his instructing attorney.  And the staff and the technicians for your cooperation to enable us to sit so late in order to try and finish the work.  I appreciate all the sacrifices that everybody is doing – is making to assist us.  Thank you very much.  We will adjourn now.     We adjourn.
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson.    I am Chairperson.    Yes thank you Chair.    Thank you Chairperson Eskom Bundle 19 Mr Zwane’s affidavits are found in Exhibit U41 on page 351.    Mr Zwane has submitted another affidavit advising the.    351 is the first affidavit.  It is by a way of reference Chair.   Is the first one.    Or is it – sorry it is the     That is the second one.    Yes that is the second one.    Yes correct Chair.   It is the second one and Mr Zwane has then submitted another affidavit.    Arising from the OUTA report and questions in relation thereto.      That is on page 353.219.      219.      Correct Chair.    Mr Zwane are you on the same page?   353.219.    It is between the tramlines it is an affidavit Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane in re respond to statement by Benjamin Cecil Clark Theron dated 24 July 17.  You see that.    The affidavit runs up to page 353.234. - .234.   You see that.  The – there is – do you confirm the signature above deponent that is your signature?    The affidavit is dated or deposed to onMay 2021 you confirm the contents of the affidavit?    That they are true and correct.    Thank you.  Chairperson I beg leave to have this affidavit dated 10 May 2021 admitted as Exhibit U41.3 together with the annexures thereto and those annexures Chair they start from page 353.235.    Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Just to recap Mr Zwane’s evidence relates to a number of aspects some of which we addressed in his last appearance and we hope to finish off today Mr Zwane.  Just in broad light or just to touch on the highlights we dealt with the issues regarding your trips to India which allegedly were sponsored by the Gupta’s.  We want to finish off on that andthen deal with issues relating to Mr Zwane’s establish – or the start as he called it his own brainchild which is the Estina Project in the Free State. We will deal with that Mr Zwane.  Deal with the issues relating to Estina the evidence of certain witnesses that have already come before the commission regarding what happened in regard to the project.  Look at whether or not the Gupta’s were involved in the project.  We will also deal with issues relating to your appointment as a MP and ultimately your appointment as the Minister of DMR – Department of Mineral Resources.  How you were appointed and what you did as a result thereof.  And also deal with the issue regarding the Waterkloof landing of the Gupta airplane in 2013 which from there is the wedding at Sun City.  And we will finalise with the closure of bank accounts.  Your chairperson should thisin the Inter Ministerial Committee and what role you played in regard thereto.  So that is – that is in a nutshell.    Yes.    Okay.      Yes let us – the emails Chairperson has in mind those ones we were dealing with.    On the previous occasion.    Okay.  So that is fine.  That is – Mr Zwane let us then pick it up from the evidence or the affidavit rather of Mr Theron and there we were dealing with the emails in regard to the bookings of the trip or the flight in September 2014 that – that booking was made by Travel Excellence     Yes.  I am going there.  That is on page 353.134.    353.134.      Mr Zwane you are there as well?    Ja.  Now the allegation in this regard MrZwane is – is that details of – of trips that you had arranged by the Gupta’s or Mr Ashu Chawla of Sahara Computers and that there were emails exchanged to show that.  Firstly we went to the one of the choir.  And maybe I should start with the choir because you have responded to that one in your affidavit.      Chair I know I have referred you to a page but because the choir issue it has come up maybe I should start with it.      Yes maybe I should start with it.    Because Mr Zwane deals with that in his affidavit.  Mr Zwane you know that in your affidavit you dosay which is the affidavit we have just submitted – admitted this morning – you do say that you in fact were on the same plane with the choir going to India.    Ja.  Because that – that is slightly different from in your main affidavit where you say you came to know about the choir being in India when you were already in India and you tried to meet with them.    Yes.  Please address the Chairperson.    Yes.  Well Mr Zwane on that issue obviously the question arises is if your choir had a lunch at Mr Gupta’s house in India how did they know about it?    Yes, no I am not sure that answers this question.  How did the choir know about Mr Tony Gupta and their itinerary including going to Mr Gupta’s house for lunch. So if you take that with the fact that it was your i-Pad, your email address it was being used to exchange information in regard to who is going to share a room and who is not going to share a room it seems from the totality of that evidence that you seem to be the connection between the choir – whether it is your choir or not but it a choir formed – founded by you and others.  You seem to be the connection between the choir and Mr Tony Gupta and/or the Sahara Computer people.  What is your comment on that?    So who were the – it is okay you have counted 27 guests and minus 3 you said 24 seems to have attended the lunch at the – at Mr Tony Gupta’s house.  Who were the other three of which you say are the department’s officials?    I see.      So that is – that is the one trip.  So your – your…    Yes Chair.    Mr Zwane you would have seen the affidavit of Mr Ephraim Dlamini one of the community members in regard to the dairy farm and he says there that to the commission in an affidavit that they had been promised.    That is on page – Chairperson it starts on page 353.308.    Yes.  308 and the paragraph I want to refer to Chair is on page 353.315 paragraph 27.    Paragraph 27.    35.    That is correct Chair.    So that is Mr Ephraim Marcosini Dlamini.  He is one of the farmers and he says and would have been one of the beneficiaries in the project and in    So the – there would be beneficiaries of the – of the project were not promised any training.     Yes, thank you Chair.  Mr Zwane, you have testified that you knew the Guptas from 2010 when they came for a TNA Breakfast.     To your knowledge, did any member of your choir have in a relationship with the Guptas, because this is now 2012.     Yes, that is why I stopped – I stoppedmyself and calling it your choir.     But I am asking did – to your knowledge ...[intervenes]      [laughs]  I will have to remember that,Chair.       Yes.     Oh.     [laughs]     Yes.  My question was.  You knew theGuptas since 2010.     Thank you, Chair.  Okay you knew them from 2010.  We are now in 2012.  And the emails are exchanged to your email address.  You are saying they are meant for the choir.  So to your knowledge, did any of your choir of the choir members have any relation or direct link with the Guptas?     Did you say Tony Wood?     Thomo?     Oh.  Ja.  And...  Oh ...[intervenes]     H’m.     [laughs]    [laughs]     Ja.     Let us – I was looking at the list of the names which is on page 353.129, Chairperson.  Point 129.     On 129, yes.     Which is that list, Mr Zwane, about sharing of the...  And those you who would not share.  I see under those you are going to share, number 8, there is that surname of Thomo.       On which page are you?    Yes.       Number 8...  those you are sharing.     Yes.       Well, could that be the person?     So the organiser did not have a computer?     How was he going to organise?     Mr Zwane, you have said that you paid for the trip yourself.     The department paid for the trip.  Can you show us where is that proof of payment?  You say it is here.     219, ja.     The annexures to that affidavit...[intervenes]      Yes.     The information you were given?     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Zwane, I see that at the top of that page – oh, that is point 236, ja.  That one the period start date is indicated to be 15 October 2013 and the period end is 23 October 2012.  Do you see that?  Period starts …[intervenes]     But the allegation regarding the India trip is said to have taken place on the 13 October 2012 which will be two days before this date there.     Yes, the choir, according to the itinerary the choir came back on the 22 October.     Which is a day before the 23 r d.     Yes, Chair, I am looking at – maybe Mr Zwane will help us.  Page 353.130 and .131.     That is in regard to the itinerary.  You will see against – there are dates there, Mr Zwane, against some of what is written there.     Home.     I think so, Chair, yes.    Yes.     Not in the files.     Well, except for what is attached here, Chair.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.     241.  It starts on 241, Chair.     Yes and Chair on – I mean, on the first one, going out, Mr Zwane, if you flew on the same flight, only date can be correct.  Either the 13 t h or the 15 t h.  So it is neither here nor there which date at this point but thefact that you flew out together, so your trip coincided almost to the letter.     Yes.     Thank you Chair.   So, I believe we have exhausted that part, you might have some questions.     Very well, Mr Zwane I will go back to Mr Theron’s affidavit, which is on page 353.22.     Yes.   Okay, so we dealt with .21, we dealt with .21, the allegation in paragraph 30.      Okay, 353.21     Yes.     No Annexure ...[intervenes]      Yes.     So, what we have been dealing with is paragraph 30, paragraph 30?     Of particular concern is the evidence.  of a kick-back from the Gupta’s to Zwane and other officials in the department who facilitate in the Estina scheme in October 2012, shortly after thelaunch of the Estina project, Zwane, officials from his department and local gospel choir…[Intervenes]”.       Okay.     353.241.     Yes.    Thank you Chair.     Let me just pursue this…[intervenes].     Let me just…[intervenes].     Mr Zwane then it means – you say the tour to the Paras plant didn’t take place?     So, the 19 t h became open – the 19 t h of October became open for you?    Yes, from your itinerary we also see that the 17 t h, the 20 t h and the 21 s t seem to be open for you.  So, what – you say yes?     And so, on those days which – four days, would you mind telling the Chairperson what would have been your activities, in those days because the itinerary for the choir  has those days, maybe youaccompanied the choir on those days?     Did you say, you did meet with thechoir?     Okay, once or twice.  The tour which didn’t take place, as you say, to Paras plant what was the purpose for that?     Yes, but what was the purpose?    H’m.     Thank you Chair.  Chair the affidavit of Mr Thabethe is in the Bundle, his trip was, according to him, on the 29 t h of February 2012 to the 4 t h of March 2012 so it would have preceded this one in October 2012.     June, 7 June 2012.     Yes, yes Chair the affidavit of MrThabethe makes an interesting reading and that’s on page 353.340 - .340.     He says, “I then made a request – well India he says is identified as the highest milk producer and there was already a bilateral agreement on Agriculture between South Africa and India.  I then made a request to the Premier honourable ES Magashule on recommendations of the former MEC Mosebenzi Zwane to take a trip to India, accompanied by MrAshok Narayan and I advised that to the office of the Premier at that time”,But, in fact he was not at the time, because his appointment was only on the 1 s t of March, I’ll show you the letter.  So, the first part, Mr Zwane is that this trip was taken at your recommendation, to India.     Yes.     But was the trip undertaken at your recommendation? MR     Ja, but this is contrary to the oversight, you claim, because in this case it’s only to go and – go to India look at – you will see as he goes further in his affidavit, is to visit, precisely this company called Paras.  So, I think his allegation would be consistent with your position that you would play an oversight role because he’s not operating the project, he’s only taking a trip to visit this potential company.    Yes.     Thank you Chair.  Mr Zwane isn’t it that Paras was going to team up with Estina to supply services or manage the project at Vrede?    Yes.      Yes.  Mr Zwane if you say you did not know the details Paras – Paras role of Estina in order to manage the project in October which is about four or five months after the agreement is signed for the purposes of a project which you initiated.  Why would you not have known what Paras role is in the project?    Yes thanks Chair.  But I think you can freely tell the Chairperson because your response seems to suggest that it is Paras you were contracting with but it was not. You contracted with Estina a company called Estina.  And in paragraph 12 Chair Mr Thebethe explains how Estina comes about.    Yes.  But you could tell – say to the Chairperson here is Paras in October you go to Paras for a tour to India to tour amongst other Paras – you say that didnot happen but you are saying to the Chairperson you were playing an oversight role but this is not a company you contracted with.  You should be actually looking at Estina – who is Estina because I want to play an oversight role and hence the reason for my question.  What did you understand Paras to be playing in the project – to be its role in the project?  And I am asking you this let me conclude it because then you can address everything.  That Paras is said to have denied its involvement in the project.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes, thank you Chair.  Yes, Mr Zwane, a couple of things and I was struck by the fact that you said the meeting with the CEO of Paras in Indian did nottake place but I thought that itinerary of yours would have been arranged on the basis that whoever you were going to see has agreed to see you.  It is a prior arrangement.  That is why it is then dated.  Even the date is there and you would know which day you are seeing who, which day you are seeing which one.  So how come that the CEO was not available?     Okay.  Two.  In regard to – back to the issues the Chairperson has been dealing with you.  Chair, I – we might as well just go into this.     [laughs]     You see ...[intervenes]      Yes.  And Mr Zwane, the evidence of the CFO, Ms Sepathi Dlamini, talks about your call to her.  Your telephone call to her ...[intervenes]      ...on the 15 t h of June 2012.  Now this is some two days or three days after your department or Exco has approved the project.  You approved on the 12 t h of June 2012.  On the 15 t h, she receives a call from you, she says.  And you wanted to enter – to go to a meeting in regard to the R 30 million prepayment.  And guess it was to who in regard to the project?  It was to Estina.     Yes, please.    Yes.     Yes, I would like you to deal with that in due course because we are going to come to them.     But just your comment on you called    Okay.     Correct, yes.     [laughs]  Ja.     My time is your time, Chair.  [laughs]     If you spent it, it is as much as I spent it, Chair.  [laughs]     Mr Zwane, the – Ms Dlamini isspecifically.  Her affidavit is here, Chair.  Specifically towards ...[intervenes]      Page 353.398.     Yes.     She is specifically talking about the R 30 million in regard to your call to her on the 15 t h of June 2015 – I mean 2012.  So you will see on page353.409 ...[intervenes]      Four, zero, nine.  Paragraph 9.       Yes.     Paragraph 9.  So this whole part, the reference you will see it is only to the R 30 million.  9.1     Mohai?  Is it an I?     I in the end.  Thank you.   “I could sense urgency in the instruction given the fact that I had to do it on a Friday in the afternoon and there was also a bank credit transfer document that had to go through Treasury for it to be send to the bank in orderof the bank to transfer the payment to the intended beneficiary (Estina) to pay for the project. The bank credit transfer document comes in the picture where the payment of any amount above one million had to be made. This process had started with myself and the Director of Finance in the Department of Agriculture having followed correct process to request payment of R 30 million...”    It is not in the department?     Okay.  You take your responsibility for it being outside of your offices of the department?     Yes, okay.     Yes, but – okay.  Here is the...  Know, she has emphasised she could sense urgency, she could sense urgency and in the subsequent paragraph, she wouldsay the same thing, the urgency from your communication with her and it is specifically in regard to the payment of R 30 million.  How did you know that this payment had to be made?  One.  Two.  What was urgent about it?  But let us deal with the first part.  How did you know this amount had to be paid?       Yes.     Sorry, I am confused.  This meeting Ms Dlamini is talking about, it is about to determine why there is a delay in paying the R 30 million.     Yes.     Yes.    Thank you, Chair.  The Chair has no follow-up questions?     No, we will finish, Chair.  By five o’clock or so we will be finished with Mr Zwane.  Mr Zwane, so that is the Estina part and the evidence by Ms Dlaminiabout a R30 million.  I had asked you the question how did you know the 30 million was to be paid.  You say no, your call was not about a payment of an amount.  You did mention, however, that there was what, reallocation to be made?     Reprioritisation.  Ja and I thought I could ask you about Ms Fourie, Anna Fourie’s evidence particularly in regard to that because in her affidavit to the Commission, which is on page 353.358 we – just go topoint 360.       Ja, point 60, yes.     Yes, let us go further because the first part, it is a confirmatory of what she did submit as her actual affidavit on page 353.360.  So Mr Zwane, she submits this affidavit. She says she had been employed by the Free State Provincial Treasury as the Deputy Director General Finance Governance.  That is in paragraph 1.      Point 360.     Point 360, yes.     So I have read paragraph 1, she wasemployed by the Free State Provincial Treasury as the Deputy Director General Finance Governance and then she makes the affidavit, paragraph 3, in her official capacity as the Deputy Director General Finance Governance – Financial Governance. “Where we now report directly to the head of department.”     Yes, I saw in one affidavit, Chair, a reference to a clause in the agreement to the effect that initial transfer payment of R30 million shall be paid into the account of the implementing agent, Estina (Pty) Ltd.     I will have to – no, I do not know offhand.       Ja, I do not know offhand.     Yes.    Yes.  But I understand you, Mr Zwane, to be saying before the adjournment that you needed to show that you will play your part and you seem to link that to the urgency of the matter.     No, sorry, not you personally, I amtalking the department – as I understood you, the department needed to show that it will play its part and that seemed to have been the reason for urgency.     Ja, that 30 million is called an initial transfer payment which I have wondered why did the department have to make it because on the evidence of Ms Dlamini – and I will read from her affidavit – apparently, Paras had undertaken to invest R228 million into the project, she says VAT inclusive.    Ja, she says – but this is at the presentation stage, this is prior to the conclusion of the agreement.     Yes.     I did not ask a question but I think you can assume from my statement to you what the question is.  Should I or do you want to say something? MR     Yes, so the question is, why did you need to make an initial payment of 30 million three days after Exco approved the project when allegedly Paras had committed to investing R228 million into the project?  Could you not have asked them to start with the payment, a down payment?     Yes.     Yes, correct.    So you are saying you are not able to say why the R30 million had to be paid within a space ofthree days after Exco had approved the project?     You are not able to.     Yes.     Ja, I am intrigued by that because this project is you initiation, it is a project which one would refer to as your brainchild inspired by your upbringing with your father, you have seen the black farmers who were not making it and you initiated the project with the intention to turn around a situation.  You go to the communities, you call meetings, you attend meetings with them in order to introduce the project, in order to identify the beneficiaries for the project and change their lives and here the process,you actually also sell the idea, as you said, to the other politicians or members of other political parties serving with you at the province.   But you seem thereafter, if one listens to your answers, to have dropped the ball.     Yes, no, I think you were on the ball, Mr Zwane, for you to phone Ms Dlamini on the 15 June 12, for you to go to India in October 2012, for you to go to the communities not only once or twice but more than that and there is a couple of things we need to ask you on this because even though you were on the ball, theprocurement and appointment of Estina was said to be noncompliant with supply chain management and go the advice from the State Law Advisers, obviously.  Do you remember that?     But you know that the State Law Advisers, when the matter came to them, the contract had already been signed and they advised that the procurement process was not complied with.     Yes.  And you have also seen that the only person in Estina was Mr Vasram who was apparently a source manager for Sahara Computers, did not have experience in farming.  You comment?     No, I want you to comment on the fact that Estina had this one person, Mr Kamal Vasram, who had no farming experience, who came from Sahara Computers as a sales manager.  Did you know that?     But you have since read about it?     Okay.     Yes.     Accountable.     Yes because we can cut a long story short.  If you say to the Chairperson, Chair, I acknowledge things did not go as they were supposed to.  You know,just piggybacking from what you were saying about people should have been held accountable, let me cut a long story short.  What do you say because I could go into the details, R184 million was ultimately paid to Estina.  You surely have been aware of that?  Yes?     Ja.  And one could also say saying – or you could take it further because you would have seen that there are allegations and with information showing that part of that R184 million ultimately found its way to Gateway, the Gupta-owned entity.  You read that in the OUTA report?     Ja.  But there persons who were identified as beneficiaries, I believe some 82 of them, did not benefit from the project.  We see that from Mr Ephraim Dlamini’s affidavit and from another beneficiary or intended beneficiary – you are going to help me pronouncing his surname.     Is it N-c-o-n-g-w-a-n-e.    Ja.  So what do you say …[intervenes]     Well, I have to put to you what they have said in their affidavits about whether they benefitted at all or not because Mr Ephraim Dlamini goes as far as saying he had a shop in town and Estina would deliver milk next door to him which was a shop owned by a gentleman of Indian origin who did not even speak the local language and he could not even obtain the milk from this project.  Your comment?     Well, you say you left the department in March 2013 but you were not far, you still remained in the Free State Provincial Government, is it not?      You were just moved to another department.      Yes, and you did come back to agriculture in 2015.    Yes, so you were not far, this project was close to your heart.      And I know that you have said in your affidavit the reason why the project did not succeed, is because of - you attribute that to poor management, or is it operations, you say that in your affidavit.     It is still your view.     What do you think went wrong because we understand cows, cattle was dying and those who sought to expose the situation, their lives were either endangered, or some of them did lose their lives, allegedly because of people who were said to be sent by you to protect your position.      You were already?    Well, to protect you.      I do not know, that is the allegation made that people were sent, maybe from tarnishing your name, you were exposed, what is happening at Vrede Dairy Farm, which is initiated by MEC Zwane, you taint his reputation, so keep your mouth shut.     Yes thank you.  Thank you Chair in fact Mr Thabethe in his affidavit says that it was Paras which recommended Estina as a local company that will – that will contract with the department.That paragraph 12 I mentioned.  So he was clearly aware of Estina and whatever relationship they had with Paras that is where it is evasive –it is unclear what was going on.  But then we had this Estina concluding the contract with you led by a man taken from an IT sector – the IT sector who does not have knowledge of farming and you would have seen from his affidavit of Mr Theron that he sends affidavit to Mr Ashu of Sahara Computers – not affidavit I beg your pardon invoices in order to be paid.  And the allegation is that he was then receiving remuneration for the service rendered at this project from the Gupta’s. Payments in the emails said pay this invoice from Linkway.  You saw that.    You would not know how he was paid?    Did you – did you know whether or notfrom the out – from the evidence of Ms Dlamini Paras did make the investment of R228 million.    Did you know that they had committed to do that investment?    Yes.    I do not know.   There is a presentation – Ms Dlamini talks about the presentation made through the department.  The presentation includes that commitment to make an investment of R228 million by Paras. Are you saying you did not know about it?    Ja I am just touching on there are other things we can move on.    Yes Chair.  So the way I understood Mr Zwane’s answer to your question Chair about whether or not he was told where the money will come from my understanding is that in fact he is the one who said go to reprioritise and get the money.  So he would have rather the instruction would have come from him to tell them where to find it as opposed to them telling him where we are going to find it.      Is that correct Mr Zwane?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja just my comment related to the 30 million in 2012.      Yes.  So Mr Zwane what I am saying is the – because it was the first question the Chairperson asked you about whether they told you where the moneywould come from and your explanation was in relation to the 30 million and the 84 million.      So I was saying the way I understood you to be saying to the Chairperson is that in respect of those amounts you instructed them to go reprioritise so that you can get that money.  So you told the…    Yes the 30 million.    Yes.  You told them where to find the money and it was them telling you where they are going to find the money.    Correct Chair.    Is my understanding correct.    Okay.    You want the tables?    Yes.    It is at the top of the page.    Okay.    Ja.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    I know it is – these are affidavits that were used in other bundles Chair.   So we will just obtain that bundle.    In the Estina work stream.    Yes.      Thank you.      Ja.    Yes.    Yes, no.  Just lastly on this point Mr Zwane. The EXCO decides on the 84 million we can see here.  The 30 million which is an advance payment is the one which I understood you to have said I told them to reprioritise and get the R30 million.  Is that understanding correct because that is what I heard you say earlier?    So you saying it is EXCO that made thatdecision.     Thank you, Chair.  Mr Zwane, aninnocent person sitting on Exco not knowing what is happening outside of what gets to be told at Exco, hearing of a project to benefit the immediate community, X amount of money will be paid according to the presentation by this company from India, R 228 million.  Who will support the project?  I am surprised you do not know about that intention by Paras to invest R 228 million but your CFO knew about it.  She talks about     Yes.     Yes.       [laughs]     [laughs]     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Zwane, it is the nature of the beast.  Let us – it is true that there was sole sourcing here?  Estina was – there was no competitive appointment?     You know that?     Yes.     And it is true that Estina was appointed as the sole service provider?     Yes.     But you knew it then.     How ...[intervenes]      So in October 2012, five months after the contract is signed.  Who did you think was rendering services at the farm?     Yes.  And to the extent that you say the problem with the project lies in the management, poor management.  Only one company was managing that project.  Is it not?     Yes.       But by one company, is it not?     Ja.     Estina badly managed this project?     Thank you, Chair.       And...  So this is the proposition I wanted to put to you and you can respond.  Becausehaving gone through the evidence that we did, at least to the extent that we have done, it seems that Estina for the project – the project may have been established for a purpose other than what was told to government, the Provincial Government. I have told you about the evidence that shows the non-compliance in the appointment of Estina, the appointment of a company which was run by a person who is not experienced in farming.  He is linked to the Guptas.  He then sent invoices to Sahara Computers that get paid by a linkway.  The payments that goes to Estina, ultimately, are channelled to the Gupta company, Gateway and the beneficiaries intended to benefit from this company.  Even on your version, they have not seen what this project wasmeant to do for them.  So it seems, given the urgency at which it was appointed, the R 30 million advanced payment, all this was meant to benefit Gupta related entities and/or the Guptas themselves.  Your comment on that?     H’m.     Left.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, there should not be.  And then it is his relation with the Guptas.     The meetings that ...[intervenes]      ...on the face of it ...[intervenes]      ...the invitations.     His appointment as the Minister.     How it came about.     And then, ultimately, the role he played when the banks closed the Gupta accounts.     Ja.     Yes.     Certainly, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Indeed, Chair.     Indeed.     Ja, we might finish.  Chairperson, they have got the files containing the affidavit and annexures to    Yes.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, it is three lever arch files...     [laughs]  [Indistinct]      Ja.     Mr Zwane, then we can go back to the – what seems to be your relation with the Guptas.  But you know it seems to come throughout that relationship?  But let us look at the trips to India and we can finalise on that.  There is one particular.  So we go back to the affidavit of ...[intervenes]     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Thank you.     [laughs]       So let us go back to the affidavit of     225, yes.  Point 225.     225.       No, look for your affidavit.       Yes.     Paragraph 9.1.12.       One point 12.     Is this where you are dealing with that allegation?     I see that what you deny is. “I deny that at any stage during my tenure as the MEC in the Free State Provincial Government I have attended a wedding of any of the Gupta family and say so with confidence in that I was not friends to the Gupta family to an extent that I would attend their weddings...”Yes.  But I see you did not deny the trip to India in December 2013.     ’13.       So I see that you did not deny the trip to India in December 2013 where you would have travelled, as they say, Mr Ashok Narayan or rather members of the Gupta family and Thom Muglama(?), Prasad Yadav, the farm manager.  So that part is not denied?     To an extent that I would attend their weddings.  So it is a qualified statement there.  So you were friend with them but you were not friends in the extent that you would attend their weddings.     The next allegation.  Oh, I am just opening a door for the Chairperson to ask questions. [laughs]     Yes.     [laughs]  As I said, Mr Zwane, keep that page open in Mr Theron’s affidavit.  The next allegation.   “The trip to Dubai and Delhi in September 14 which Gupta employees at Sahara arranged and which the Gupta family paid for.   The flight tickets are evidence that Zwane flew to Dubai and then Delhi in the company of Rajesh (Tony) Gupta and Salim Essa andSurya Kant Singhala. The purpose of this trip is unknown...”    Correct.  Thank you, Chair.  And she     Well, she explains it’s a ...[intervenes]      No, it is not a name, but it is a …[intervenes]     Yes, it means brother.     Ja, it is a sign of respect or affiliation of some sort, ja.     So she says    Of Ms Allana.     Mr Zwane has read it.     May I say we could only provide it yesterday because we received it yesterday.     Ja.    Yes.     Yes, Chair, I was going to just say the     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  So, Chair, for now I would not go into the details of Ms Allana’s affidavit because she then attaches the passports that she has of the …[intervenes]     Ja.     353.261.5 but the next page is the – are the important ones.     Yes, 261.5 is the beginning of her affidavit.     So paragraph 7, Mr – well, let us start at 5.       Go to point 6.     Ja, point 5 is the beginning of the     Should I read it, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.      “I hereby wish to respond to a request from investigators of the Judicial Commission of Inquiryinto Allegations of State Capture, the Commission,  who have requested all Travel Excellence records concerning Mr Mosebenzi Zwane with identification number…” And the number is given. “I have never met, corresponded with or received any payments for travel undertaken by Mr Zwane.  All interactions in respect of Mr Zwane’s travel arrangements were with Mr Salim Essa and Mr Ashu Chawla.”    Or Chawla, is that Chawla?     No, my junior is nodding, Chair, Chawla.     My junior says Chawla.     She must be.  No, if she is wrong, they chop head.(?). 18.30     6. “I reviewed my email account at Travel Excellence and retrieved an email dated 12 September 2014 which I compiled and sent to Ashu@sahara.co.za. A printout of the email is attached hereto marked annexure HA1.  In the aforesaid email I have attached the travel itineraries for the following     Yes.     Allana.     Allana, Halima Allana.     Yes.  Chair, you know, it is one thing to read the affidavit, it is another thing to look at the emails, Mr Zwane, because the emails are striking and …[intervenes]     Ja.     Let us go to page – well, the first email Chair is point, 261.9, so HA1, page 353, point 261.9, so that’s Ms Helana on the 12 t h of September 2014 writing toMr Ashu and ...[intervenes]      Correct Chair, @sahara.co.za.     The attachments ...[intervenes]    Correct.    But the attachments again have three names, Ajesh Gupta, Zwane and Suria Singana.  Then you turn the page.     Then the next page is the itinerary for Mr Salim Essa     Point 10.     And Mr Rajesh Gupta.     But the dates is 13 September, 14 September, 16 September, 17 September, 20 September and 21 September, exactly the same dates that we have seen in your – in respect of the itinerary relating to you Mr Zwane.  And I think the places are the same, they’re travelling from Jo’burg to Dubai, from Dubai to India, and then from India back to Dubai, when they are in Dubai then they go to Zurich, Switzerland and from Switzerland backto Dubai and ultimately Dubai to Johannesburg, exactly the same trip as yours.     Ja.      Ja.     Yes, that’s the one, Mr Zwane’s one then Chair which we have read, is a duplication of the one we have read earlier.     It is on page 353.261.13, HA3.     It is – the route is the same, we have gone through it.      It’s exactly the same Chair.     That is what I haven’t looked at, let’s see.       Yes Chair.     The 13 t h.     Of May.    No, no that is enough Chair.  That is two weeks.     We can give the questions by this weekend Chair.    Yes, because they are already here.     Correct Chair.    Good evening Chair.     Yes we are ready Chairperson     As the Chairperson indicated this evening session is in regard to Mr Koko and I think due to the time lapse we may have to administer the oath or affirmation.     Thank you Chairperson.   On the last occasion we were about to go into the affidavit of Ms Suleiman in regard to the travel of Mr Koko to Dubai, before we go there Chair I would like to just touch on certain matters in relation to McKinsey and Trillian and see whether we can come close to finalising on that.  I know we have some affidavit outstanding but we probably will have to make a different arrangement in regard to how we deal with those affidavits, and I want to Mr Koko start with Eskom Bundle 14[c] on page 811.112, and I want to explain that because this deals with the requirement of National Treasury approval.  Both Mr Koko and Mr Singh Chair have said, have alleged in this email from the official of NationalTreasury are exactly as – well the version is quite different by Mr Koko and Mr Singh but maybe they will – Mr Koko will explain to you why reference to this email has been made.  That email is an exchange between Mr Dave Gorey of Eskom, this email is the first at the bottom of the page – oh wait, in the middle of the page, there is an email from Dave Gorey ...[intervenes]      So the first email is in the middle of the page, from Mr Dave Gorey to DJ@Eskom.co.za on Thursday the 4 t h of February 2016 at 3.07pm, it says “sorry Chair ...[indistinct] cc Mr Charles Kamima, the subject is     Thank you.  Then at the top of that is areply email from Solly.ctangana@treasury.gov.za sent on     Can you tell the Chairperson why were you making reference to the email?     Yes, the writing was on the wall.     Ja, I wouldn’t know. MR     Yes, no that certainly expedites the proceedings, I only wanted to refer – to bring it to the Chairperson’s attention because it had been mentioned but Chair as Mr Koko says insofar as he is concerned the pointdoesn’t need to be belaboured, he has given you what he understands is let – this email exchanged comes he says after the fact, the contract had been concluded without having obtained initial Treasury approval.  It is the significance of that step which is under scrutiny Mr Koko, the significance of that step and – because in terms of the Act wherever the Act is referred to ...[intervenes]      It appears ...[indistinct] the Public     No we do Chair.     We do I have ...[intervenes]     Chair I have it.     But as we go into it Chair, and this is alegal matter, ...[intervenes]     I have it ...[indistinct] I will do that.     Yes I will give you the reference.     Chair as we do that I just want to underscore that by just – and I appreciate Mr Koko is not a lawyer, irregularity is one thing, unlawfulness is another.   Here this contract is not just irregular, this contract is unlawful and unenforceable, for want of compliance with a legislative requirement.    Now let’s go to what Mr Koko is drawing to your attention.  It is in Eskom Bundle 15[b], and that is on page 613.  So this is – the document is Eskom Procurement and Supply Management Procedure.     Page 613, but Chair you have to read that in context with where the paragraph starts.     Okay.     The paragraph is qualified Chair.     It is heavily qualified.       Let’s go to it, straight to it, because ...[intervenes]      2.6.7, we’re looking ...[intervenes]      The bullet point, the third bullet point.     So this says, and Chair look at theheading, “Condonation of Irregular Procurement”.     Now I have made a distinction between an irregularity and a nullity.    Because here is the irregularity in the procurement, it is a process related defect.     It is not a substance related defect.    Some might go to substance, the one...[intervenes]     Ja, then you have whenever an Eskom employee procures assets, goods or services by any means without adherence to the approved procurement framework, now that is important Chair, and that is why I am emphasizing here is procedure.       The condonation process must be followed in order to give effect to the irregular procurementand enable payment to the supplier.     Yes, then there could be payment, and  let me skip the first two, they are important those bullet     We should read them?     The first one is    Yes.     One, or bullet one. “A disciplinary/remedial process where the employee who committed an act of financial misconduct may be disciplined according to the approved HR/IR policies and procedures.  This is incompliance with the PFMA requirement or the effecting of disciplinary action if irregularities have occurred within the execution of procurement.”     Procurement and Tender Committee, thank you.   With Group Technology and – wait – all conditions must be lodged with the Procurement Tender Committee Secretariat with the Risk & Governance TrendsAnalysis and Commercial Risk Control Departments within Group Technology and Commercial.Where a risk assessment must be conducted in consultation with the line management of the defaulting employee, in order to determine the risks faced by Eskom as a result of the procurement irregularity and any specific actions that need to be taken in order to rectify or prevent the irregularity from reoccurring.  The R & G, which is Risk & Governance Department, will follow up with the relevant line managers on the status of the corrective, preventative or disciplinaryprocesses to be taken within the agreed timeframes and will report thereon via the Senior Manager Risk and Governance to the Group Commercial and Management Committee, appear from their office and Group & Divisional Executives. And bullet point 3 Chair is the one Mr Koko is referring to.   A payment process to the supplier which    It reads - the relevant PTC is required to approve the payment to the supplier against number one there must be a valid invoice and number two to the extent that Eskom has a valid contractual obligation to pay.  If their contract is a nullity Chair it is unenforceable againstthe SOE and then you have another issue here, unless ...     Unless otherwise advised by the Eskom Legal Department which means you also need them to be made aware of the – in this case the irregularity in order to give advice one way or the other.  Then the ultimate step ...[intervenes]     Yes.    Yes that is the – that is…    And then unless otherwise.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Chair just to say in this matter the matter did come to court and Chair is correct in othermatters where third parties are involved you may want to say well look you will affect an adversely innocent third parties just carry on with this contract.In this case when it – when the matter went to court to review McKinsey and Regiments were all – Trillian were ordered to repay the money.  In fact McKinsey offered to pay the money before the judgment was out.  Trillian was fighting it that very ultimately ordered to pay.So in this case the money they were ordered to repay and issues of unjustified enrichment did not arise.  But that is because Chair there is a distinction where you fail to follow your own internal processes and the party you contracting with does not know that.  That is the Chair quant rule situation where well your directors represented to me they have got the approval – well they complied with internalprocesses you cannot tell me otherwise after I have contracted with you.But when it is a matter of law and as the Chair says we can deal with that in due course.  It is a different matter and in particularly in this case where..    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair     Yes please comment.    Thank you Chair.  Just before I go there.    Thank you Chair.  Then I wish to refer Mr Koko to page – on the same bundle 14 (c) 811.    Ja that you can put aside.  The one about the supply chain management – yes.  Go back to 14(c) page 811.170   Page 811    .170.  Chair I wish to be fairly quick on this.    Yes.      .170    Yes.      Yes (c).    So this is an email from Mr Prish Govender Wednesday 2 September 2015.  It is addressed to Mr Koko he has copied in is Mr Singh and Edwin Mabelane – Subject is Feedback on McKinsey negotiations the attachment is feedback on the negotiations.  Final pack pdf    Is he is the same department as you but in a different division?    Please explain his designation.    Yes.    Group Tech – Group Technology and Commercial. So what was your position at the time again?    Group Technology Commercial is that – is that position your explaining consistent with the feedback of October you gave.    Is that correct.  Oh Chair I just want to –you signed the feedback is 22 October..    And your position was Group Executive Group Technology and Commercial.    So – so in September you were still in that position.    So Mr Prish Govender is in GroupTechnology and Commercial Division.    Which is where you were the GE.    You are saying he reported to you.    Even in September    Who reported to you – Edwin Mabelane?    Are you talking about Mr Edwin Mabelane now?    Ja but I am talking in September 2015.    So the covering letter is on the next page.      The – this covering letter he refers to is    Yes, no I did say I cannot recall.    Main negotiator.    Yes.  Well…    Yes Chair.    Yes.    The transactions.   We are trying to finalise McKinsey Trillian.  The other transactions will be in relation to Tegeta.    And I – well the plan was before we to get to Tegeta because it is quite heavy we could get out of the way the travel to Dubai.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes Chair.    Ja we – we will also briefly touch on – associated with the travel Mr Koko links or otherwise or relations or otherwise with the Gupta’s    Ja.    Ja Mr Koko okay – the thing is I ask youone question you answer it by giving …    Yes.  Because there is a problem with this agreement you say you signed as well and I do not want to go there because we did go into it when you first appeared.    Ja thank you.  Thank you.  The Chairperson for the Chairperson’s benefit Mr Koko if you did nothing is it not surprising because as you told the Chairperson last time you signed what I have now seen iscalled the position paper which adopts the treasury regulations of 2013/2014.  It came into effect on the 1s t of January 2014.      Yes.  In August 2014 you signed it.    And that is the cost containment and you appoint consultants on the basis of the fee, correct?    I would have thought in September 2015which is the year later when Mr Prish Govender says to you we need your intervention on Section 3 and the first foremost item on that section.    He said Section 3.    Yes.      And he watches Chair.    And he watches.  Ja I would have thought that being familiar with that specific issue he was raising in 3.1 you would have done something – so I am surprised when you say you did not – you did nothing.    So if you do not have an answer to that that is okay.  I am just expressing myself.    Ja.     Yes, I remember those emails which you say are to Dr Ngubane, which he has denied, but I donot recall in any of those emails that you are saying you need Treasury approval.       Chair?     This matter was decided by BTC.  Dr Ngubane was not a BTC.  So ...[intervenes]      ...discuss with him.    I...  Yes, I have the emails which Mr Koko sends out to Dr Ngubane.     I have opened to them.  Maybe Mr Koko should check and tell us which one says to Dr Ngubane you need Treasury approval ...[intervenes]      ...for the MSA.    Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     [Indistinct] [Speaker moves away from microphone – unclear]  That is fine, Chair ...[intervenes]      We will also – ja, let me not say upfront but...  Then Chair, let me – maybe this might be the last or...  Mr Koko, let us go to page 829.36 ...[intervenes]      Six...  Page - I mean, 829.36.  I ...[intervenes]      Yes.  I listened last time, Mr Koko, when you were saying there was a payment to be made in terms of this agreement.     That is right.     The people are saying there was no figure but there was an amount to be paid.  Is my recollection correct?     Not correct?     Okay.     I have not asked the question yet, except those that you have answered.  Now in this document, we have seen that your feedback to the BTC is that the value of the contract is zero, correct?     Well ...[intervenes]      Let me read to you then.    Yes, let us go to paragraph – the     Chair, let us see how that comes about.     Because it is not ratification ofanything.     On page 829.39 because that repeatedly says the contract is zero because it is self-funding.  It is risk based.  Then on page 829.39, you have two columns.  The second two columns and on the right     That is correct, Chair.     And the second one is    Is maintained for Eskom.     “There will, however, be a timing  “difference from cash-flow perspective in terms of realising the zero rand value principle...”  It is correct, Mr Koko, then is it that it is as a result of McKinsey’s insistence that the down payment of R 475 million was arrived at?     Say again?     Yes.  The ...[intervenes]      Yes.     On the next page, Chair, which deals with recommendation.     Point 43.     Paragraph 5 – paragraph 3.  First it     40?     Oh, yes.       Yes.  No, I have finished the part I wanted to read there, Chair.     Yes.    I am sorry.     Sorry, Chair.     Let us go to page 829.43.       [No audible reply]      And you have paragraph 3, Financial     In progress.     Thank you, Chair.  “...and the financial report will be submitted to the members at the meeting...”Was that done Mr Koko?     Then paragraph 4, Recommendation    Well ...[intervenes]      Well ...[intervenes]      No.  Chair, he ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes.     Yes.     He says ...[intervenes]     No, I was not questioning that.  I was questioning how the amount came about.     The down payment came about.     Sorry, Chairperson.     Sorry, just give me the date of the BTC meeting?     Page reference?     Oh it is not the minutes.  It just anextract.     Yes.     Mr Koko, there is also something I was looking for here which I am not immediately finding which is that you also recommended additions to the project.     Not you personally but ...[intervenes]      No, Mr Koko.  The people who signed the recommendation is – are here.  Charles Kalema ...[intervenes]      ...Govender, Mandla Nobinga(?) if I am pronouncing it correctly.  And then Matshela Koko.      Yes.     Thank you, Chair.     So the recommendations then have that 4.4 as well above the signatures or just before the people signing.  The SOE format Service Level Agreement, format of contract can be approved with its associated conditions.  And then that condition included Clause 22 about you will do nothing until you have received Treasury approval.  You remember the clause?    Okay.  So 4.4 reads    And that SLA included, it was 22, in terms of which Eskom undertook that it will do nothing – and I am paraphrasing – until it has received Treasuryapproval.       Yes.  Thank you.  Then lastly is 4.5     That you and Mr Anoj added to the original proposal that had been made by McKinsey and Regiments ...[intervenes]     ...or Trillian.     Yes, thank you, Chair.  Ms Mothepu – I will read from the affidavit, it is one of the bundles, but     So the claims management, there the package is.     So are you saying to the Chairperson what Ms Mosilo is saying here as initiatives added, online vending, Duvha insurance, rebuild Hitachi, were they in the proposal or were they not in the proposal?     Okay, so the answer is, no they are not in the proposal.     They would not have been part of the MSA.     Chairperson, can we go to bundle 16(b) just to finish off on this point?     Ja, just keep it there.  16(b), this is Mr Anoj’s bundle.  Did I say 16(b)?  Ja, so Mr Singh has provided a supplementary affidavit to the Commission.  The affidavit starts on page 1016 but I want – I would like you     Is the Chairperson there?       Thank you, Chair.  The paragraph 11     Ja, let us continue.     Ja, the rest of the Eskom team is there.  Well, ja, those who constituted Steerco and then you have other members from McKinsey and Trillian.  Ms Mothepu is also there.  Then the agenda is repeated.  You     Ja.  Then on the next page, Chair, you     Ja.     Chair, I do not believe that is correct because I have asked for this bundle after it was updated to be sent to Mr Ndou.  He is nodding his head.  Yes [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Because I was copied in the email thatwent to him, witnessed his statement.     Yes.     Witness 3 …[intervenes]     Ja and Prof Lourens because they asked for it.     Yes, Mr Koko, the Chair will look at the emails from Ms Mothepu because Ms Mothepu testifies about the emails that she sent to you.  I do not think they    Yes, but wait, that is not the point.      What I am saying to you is this.  TheChairperson will look at the emails which is not gossip, it is emails that has been sent one, to you – I mean, one, to your PA that copied you and the others are sent directly to you and she is thanking you for having met with you and she also arranges to have a meeting.  And she testifies to the extent of those emails, nothing more, nothing less.     Yes, Chair.     Chair and I did not want to go into thismatter but it is important to see what Ms Mothepu writes in the email because it is not about I am pursuing the matter with Mr Koko when he has already left his office or his position as – whichever position it was.  A person who writes – and these emails, we read them, you know, previously.  But here is the one of 30 November 2015.  She     Which is not gossip.     It is not me, there is nothing wrong or right about …[intervenes]     Well, let me read the other one, 5 December 2015.     And it reads    Let me read it.  I say    Ja, Chair.  Mr Eric Wood or Dr Eric Wood, we know is at Trillian, he is Ms Mosilo’s boss.  She has gone back after meeting with you to discuss the additional financial initiatives that need to be included and she is saying to you we need more information and they would like time early this week to set up – time early this week with yourself and your team to source the information in order to complete the business cases by the end of the week.    Never what?     Thank you, Chair.       No, I will recall …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, I have not – I have not looked at this recently, because I was prepared to ...[intervenes]     it is not that type of evidence.  If you become pedantic and you just follow paperwork, Ms Mothepu is going to be exposed and she needs to come and explain to you why she says I have changed and added items when the additions served on her to the board on the 6 October and she refers to the November and December.  And in any event, Chair, in any event, Ms Mothepu, and here is one issue that makes her argument fall.  One of the things that she says I added was master – vendor procurement, which is not part of 4.5.  Vendor procurement is not part of Generation, vendor procurement is not part of [indistinct], vendor procurement is not part of claims management.   So the things that she says I have added, two ofthem, Duvha insurance and master vending are not part of 4.5.  She was blatantly lying to you.  Now you need to understand, given the documents here because the documents are telling you something different and we will get to other witnesses.  I mean, I received a document, an affidavit from witness 3, that all of a sudden she says I did not know Mr Koko in 2013 but I saw him and recognised him.  Why would somebody who does not know me, saw me seemingly.  The evidence before you, Chair, that you must go, when you sit on your own, making your report, mustjust look at the documents and the evidence. Duvha insurance, master services, is not part of this 4.5.  That is the evidence before you.     Yes, thank you, Chair.  Ms Mothepu – I will read from the affidavit, it is one of the bundles, but     So the claims management, there the package is.     So are you saying to the Chairperson what Ms Mosilo is saying here as initiatives added, online vending, Duvha insurance, rebuild Hitachi, were they in the proposal or were they not in the proposal?     Okay, so the answer is, no they are not in the proposal.     They would not have been part of the MSA.    Chairperson, can we go to bundle 16(b) just to finish off on this point?     Ja, just keep it there.  16(b), this is Mr Anoj’s bundle.  Did I say 16(b)?  Ja, so Mr Singh has provided a supplementary affidavit to the Commission.  The affidavit starts on page 1016 but I want – I would like you     Is the Chairperson there?       Thank you, Chair.  The paragraph 11     Ja, let us continue.     Ja, the rest of the Eskom team is there.  Well, ja, those who constituted Steerco and then you have other members from McKinsey and Trillian.  Ms Mothepu is also there.  Then the agenda is repeated.  You     Ja.  Then on the next page, Chair, you     Ja.    Chair, I do not believe that is correct because I have asked for this bundle after it was updatedto be sent to Mr Ndou.  He is nodding his head.  Yes [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Because I was copied in the email that went to him, witnessed his statement.     Yes.     Witness 3 …[intervenes]     Ja and Prof Lourens because they asked for it.     Yes, Mr Koko, the Chair will look at the emails from Ms Mothepu because Ms Mothepu testifies about the emails that she sent to you.  I do not think they     Yes, but wait, that is not the point.      What I am saying to you is this.  The Chairperson will look at the emails which is not gossip, it is emails that has been sent one, to you – I mean, one, to your PA that copied you and the others are sent directly to you and she is thanking you for having met with you and she also arranges to have a meeting.

A person who writes – and these emails, we read them, you know, previously.  But here is the one of 30 November 2015.  She    Which is not gossip.     It is not me, there is nothing wrong or right about …[intervenes]     Well, let me read the other one, 5December 2015.     And it reads    Let me read it.  I say    Ja, Chair.  Mr Eric Wood or Dr Eric Wood, we know is at Trillian, he is Ms Mosilo’s boss.

Never what?     Thank you, Chair.       No, I will recall …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, I have not – I have not looked at this recently because I was prepared to ...[intervenes]      So I wouldn’t hold his hand, I would hold his hand ...[intervenes]      Yes.     So I will read this other one Chair which is on the 5 t h of December 2015 ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes, okay, my junior has opened up to something, this email suggests, can I read it into the record Chair, that’s all ...[intervenes]      It says, it attaches a financial – whatis this, attached please find the financial stream initiative for your review and comment.     It is addressed to Mr Koko Chair.     Yes, and she says “I am available on my mobile phone ...[intervenes]      SM Bundle 14.     [c] on page 811.256.     14[c].     .256.     Yes.     Yes.   Pause there Chair, just pause there Mr Koko, the transcript which my junior has just opened, her evidence on the 14 t h of January 2021 on page185 you – the Chairperson is asking she is talking about these emails and the next page, on the next page and the Chairperson when you say on the next page you mean 588.150, she says yes.   So the previous email I sent at nine minutes past eight I had time to go to meet with Mr Matshela Koko.  He had made up the itinerary views and so I sent him the updated proposal at the same day, the 7 t h of    Correct.    The one of the 5 t h?     Of the 7 t h, okay, Chair let me read what she says.    She says ...[intervenes]      She says yes ...[intervenes]     Because we were taking it with chronology of the email.      She says yes so the previous email I sent at nine minutes past, so let’s check, we can check the ...[intervenes]     It’s ten past nine.  And then she says I had time to go to meet with Mr Matshela Koko.     He had made updates and reviews.    He had made updates and reviews.     And so I sent him the updated proposal     Yes.     They are here to, they attach even in the email of the 5 t h Abbie, yes there are annexures ...[intervenes]      I don’t know who ...[intervenes]      Let me go there Chair.  But then Chair in that evidence or oral testimony there is Mr Koko who is saying I am not giving you a direct answer, you askwhether did they  meet to discuss this, there’s the answer.     He said no, Ms Matshepo – I don’t have to speak for her, because I couldn’t remember what she said.     It is on ...[intervenes]      ...page 811.278.    278.  And it is eight minutes past nine that email.  Again to Mr Koko.    Monday 7 December 2015 at 809, she said emailing from Matshepo@regiments, kokomm@eskom.co.za updates proposal, Eskom cash unlocking and balance sheet optimisation initiative 7 December. “Good morning Matshela  Attached please find the update proposal for your consideration.  Kind regards,” And then the document follows Chair.    Correct.     Or Regiments.     Yes.     No Chair, well ...[intervenes]       Yes, yes, this is from one side Chair.     Yes.     Correct Chair.    Can I ...[intervenes]     Or shall I do when we come back?     I wanted to answer your question as to whether the meeting did take place.     This one, because her evidence is here Chair, what Mr Koko is reading is about 1 December, we are now on the 7 t h of December.     Then I ask him now the email – the email – the email Ms Matshepo on – I gave the page ...[intervenes]      It is – the date is again the 14 t h ofJanuary 2021, the page is 187.     And I am reading from the top of the page.   “Now the email Ms Matshepo on page [and I use the     Yes.     Yes she says we met with the technicalteam, let me see ...[intervenes]      Ja, I will go back to my plan Chair, thank you.    Thank you Chair, so we can leave aside that before I raise the emails of Ms Matshepo.     The one with the emails of Ms Matshepo, I think it is 14[c] ...[intervenes]     [c] ja.  Mr Koko I just want to go back to the presentation ...[intervenes]      Monday yes.    16[b] yes.  Just one item ...[indistinct] Mr Koko ...[intervenes]      Ja, let’s go to page 11.17  So Mr Koko at the bottom of 11.17 the next block which is approval – IL to approval of fixed grants contracts Kemden, the executive sponsor there is indicated as yourself, minimise R/L cost of fixed priced contracts for uncontracted volumes at Kemden and your name appears in the next one so I am going to go through them then you can explain them to the Chairperson.  Fixed price contracts Grootvlei, you also appear there a executive sponsor, fixed price contracts Arnot, you also are the executive sponsor, next page Dutuka Kemden ...[intervenes]     It is for Mr Koko to explain Chair, he is there as the executive sponsor in what on the face of itseems to be issues relating to the price of the contract, which would suggest the financial part of the contract.     If he – well Mr Koko has said to the Chairperson my involvement was just generation and I was dealing with generation, the finances were not my part ...[intervenes]      Of course he was not.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, let me add the last one Chair then we can finish, page 11.23, that block at the top, number 5, finance, must have vending agent as Eskom lead is Matshela Koko and at the end you have conclusion of the Duvah insurance claim and Eskom lead again is yourself Mr Koko.  And in particular there’s ...[intervenes]      Remember Ms Masiva said it was added, it wasn’t in the original, it was added by Messrs Singh and Mr Koko as some of the new initiatives and Mr Koko said it was not but here we see it in the presentation, one, and number two it falls under finance and Mr Koko features there, maybe you can explain that to the Chairperson and we move along.     So you were negotiation the point of price there?    In those Kemden?      Yes of course that is one aspect of it Mr Koko that ...[intervenes]     Chairperson the bigger picture is this, the stakeholder This stakeholder which is allocating responsibilities to each other on the 9 t h of February 2016 has gone ahead to do this meeting in respect of this contract when they know that there is no National Treasury approval.   Ms Matshepo in addition to that says Duvah insurance was added, and there is the Duvah insurance claim which Mr Koko earlier said it wasn’t part of the Master Service Agreement.    But we see it in the presentation which Mr Anoj Singh has provided to the Commission as evidence.    And how then ...[intervenes]       Yes Chair it shows two things that page, well there’s a multi-faceted issues about this, because I was pursuing – I was pursuing one particular issue in regard to Mr Koko’s involvement, even in this area of finance which according to the presentation he was there, he has given you his version and then what Ms Masilo said was one of the aspects or initiatives added, but we have come to the end of it.     Yes.     Yes, Chair I read the paragraph in Matshepo, where she said what she says, Mr Koko denies that, I heard that ...[intervenes]     I haven’t answered the Chairperson’s question?     Ja, with Mr Koko Chair it is one followsthe broader picture that Mr Koko goes into certain details and unless one goes into these details you are going to leave them hanging.  So ...[intervenes]      No Chair I am done on it, it is the bigger picture, but I am done with it.     The bigger picture is the process engaged in the negotiation of the MSA, the team that was involved and how each one of them plays a role in the negotiation of the MSA, that was the bigger picture.   Now we have attempted to go into the details, of course as you say well you don’t need to address everything that Mr Koko says but I have tended to go there to show whether something is correct or not correct.     And ...[intervenes]     Ja.     Ja, correct Chair, that is correct.     No that is 2016.     Ja.    You see it is something like this Chair, I have the evidence to show that he signed Eskom positon paper in  August 2015 already.     We already addressed it Chair, it is going back to it.    We did ...[intervenes]     Thank you Chair.    We can traverse two aspects, as I was saying to Mr Koko during the break, his travel to Dubai and witness to his evidence in regard to what he says he saw Mr Koko at Saxonwold.  What then remains Chair is the issue of Tegeta which we can deal with on Monday.    Thank you Chair.  So let’s deal with the travel agent Mr Koko, which is in Bundle 18[d].  Chair so we move, we take away Eskom Bundle 14.  [d] page 1565.7.       65.7      Is the Chairperson there?  Thank youChair.   I will simply read from the affidavit.   Travel     No.     Yes.     Ja, “During December 2015 I received a request from Mr Essa to arrange flight tickets for a Mr Matshela Moses Koko.”     Yes. “I received a request from Mr Essa to arrange flight tickets for Mr Matshela Moses Koko and two of his family members, these being a Miss Mesima Elizabeth Koko and a Mr Peha Koko.  This was for their travel from Denpasar, Bali to Dubai on 4 January 2016 and from Dubai through Johannesburg on 20 January 2016.  The tickets were duly issued as follows.” And the table is given of the tickets that were issued.      Yes no this affidavit has not been dealt with in relation to Mr Koko.     Yes Chair let me just summarise this because the trip that was meant to be a return trip on thet h the ticket was changed, or the booking was changed and he returned on the 5 t h of January 2016.     Ja.  So you know the allegations that Mr Essa is the one who arranged this.     And that the invoice issued in Mr Singh’s name it was a mistake, that it had Mr Singh’s name, it should have been – well I don’t know whether it should have been your name or Mr Essa but the expense for the trip were allocated again to Mr Essa as they say and then paragraph 32 Chairperson ...[intervenes]       Yes, and the payments is in paragraph 32 on page 1565.9, she says on January 2016 I received a call from either Mr Essa or his secretary indicating that the driver would be dropping off the money to settle the invoice in respect of Mr Koko’s travel arrangements.  The driver dropped R100 000 cash at my house, which I turn deposited at the bank into our bank account and indicate the reference as S.Essa, the reference of EFT on the receipt was an error.   So I think on the receipt Mr ...[intervenes]       Mr Koko you would have seen ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Is it S34?  So they had ticked offEFT, there are three options, cash, cards, EFT, paid by cash, cards, EFT, they ticked off EFT and the way I understand her she say that was a mistake.   But I think you need to tell the Chairperson Mr Koko ...[intervenes]      Correct.    Pont 59.    Alana yes Chair.    Or Sulliman sorry.    We will keep them there Chair.    She said    It is the same affidavit.     Yes, Chair.     Indeed.     We – I can ask two or three or – ja.  Or should they wait?  Let them wait, Chair.     Let them wait.     Ja.    Thank you, Chair. 
MR ZWANE:  Chairperson good morning.    Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane.    No.    I truly affirm.    I am.    Yes.    I do.    Yes.    Yes I do.    Yes I do.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Huh-ah.    Yes I did realise that.    Thank you Chair.  Let me deal with that matter.   I was aware that the choir would be taking a trip.  I did say that.  I also said I was not involved in terms of the organisation of that trip.  I did indicate that I said to the choir I was also going to the – to India around that month and if it happens that we meet in India and I have time I will make time and come and see them performing.  And I should also say Chair I did say I did not become part of the travelling arrangement with the choir.   My name was included in the itinerary of the choir which we dealt with the last time and I said that I do not know how my name was included there because I made my own travel arrangement and contrary to the view that was expressed by Mr Theron that I was paid for by the Gupta’s I now – I was fortunately able during the week which I wasgiven by this commission to get documents that indicates that there was an approval given to me as a MEC to go to India and go and lieu investors there.   I have since also included as an annexure the payment thereof because I was fortunate to get that.  And the issue of – the issue that I dealt with earlier on that I was not part of the itinerary of the choir or the people who were arranged for by the choir.   There was a question that was asked to me that was I part of the lunch that was prepared and in the email of MrTheron it is indicated that 24 people attended the lunch.   If you minus 24 from 27 which is in the itinerary it will make clear to this commission that the three people that are part of the approval of the trip were not part of that lunch.  So I thought I should raise those issues and clarify.    Yes.      I did – I did explain and clarify that matter last when I was here.  I do not own the choir; the choir is not my choir.  I have said I did give or lend a hand there and therewhere they would need my support because I was involved in the formation of the choir as a program of government which was called social cohesion.  There were a number of activities that were undertaken under social cohesion.  So I may not know the details in terms of how the choir goes about in terms of sourcing funds I did raise that point even last time.    Chair I did indicate last time when I was here that indeed at some point I did lend my gadget to a member of the choir who wanted to send a Gmail.  I did say – I did say in my last statement that I was not privy to the contents of that email as it was sent.  I deny the assertion that I seem to be a common denominator in this arrangement.  Ihave said earlier on the choir made its own arrangements which I am not privy to and I want to put that statement and repeat it on record here today.      The three was me, Ms Matau [?] and Mr Ashok Narayan.   She was an official working in my department Chair.    The office manager.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair I planned my trip to India followed all the processes evidence thereof is here and I think in themiddle or towards the end of processes I learnt that the choir was going to India that is what I have said even in my affidavit around the same – same time.  That is why I said if my program allowed I will take a turn where you are because I am going to India on my work.  That is what transpired Chair.    No it was not – it was not on my side planned Chair.    I think so.   No thank Chair.  I have read this affidavit by Mr Dlamini.  I would have loved if Mr Dlamini was asked by this commission to give evidence in terms of that assertion because to the best of recollection my knowledge and beliefthere was never a stage where I was present as the MEC of Agriculture and people were promised to go to India – to do what?    The – there was – there were beneficiaries of the project that would have been trained in South Africa mainly because they were farmers who would have known in the course of them doing their business simple facts about farming.  It boggles my mind why would we then have taken people to India for a simple training – by whom?  Because those would have in the affidavit of Mr Dlamini in issues that we are discussing here who was supposed to train them in India?    If there is any evidence to that Chair I will be gladly willing to engage but from where I am seated there was never at any point during my tenure as the MEC of Agriculture where beneficiaries were promised a trip to India.   In fact if you look at witnesses that have came here it took some time before beneficiaries were properly organised into a unit and by the time they would have formed committees and so forth I would have never – I would have actually moved out of that department.  Because this trip was around October in 2012 and if you look at your details in terms of what was happening during that time it was the time where the department was busy still bringing these beneficiaries together trying to get into contracts with them. So there is – I do not think there is an issue or any matter that was raised of the building training to India that I know of.     Yes.     Paras.      No, Chair I would not be speculating.  I am saying to this Commission ...[intervenes]      I – to the best of my recollection and myknowledge and belief, that was never the case.  If that is the case, that Mr Dlamini produced evidence so that the person who promised them can actually be able to answer what was on his mind when he promised these people.     Yes.     I would prefer that we do not call this choir my choir.     Yes.     Umsingizane.     Yes.     No, you can just say the choir.  I think I will understand.       Yes, Chair.     [No audible reply]      Chair, I have never called you by your clang name in this Commission.     But allow me to say [speaking vernacular]     I would not know how they arrived...[intervenes]      ...to that particular name.     As you say, I know that Umsingizane is a grass.     That is normally not eaten by cattle.     It is used to do the Zulu and Sotho lands(?) and hence Sotho.     That is all what I know.     ...I would not know.     Yes.     [laughs]     Ja, that is correct.     The organiser of the choir at that time, I think it was Mr Thomo.  In fact, I must say, maybe it will assist the Commission, that the choir was composed of upand coming artists van different areas, as I have said.  Different backgrounds and - but seemingly when the choir – after the choir was formed, they then agreed that – they said Mr Thomo would actually be the organiser.       Organiser.     In terms of whatever events that must come.     Yes.    I would not know exactly his networks and connections but he did his job very well, I must say.  Because, as I have said earlier on, the choir travelled the length and breadth of South Africa and...  So to go to your question.  I would not know that information but he was an easy-to-go person.     Thomo.     Yes.     Yes.     T-h-o-m-o.     I think his name was Mfanafuthi.     Yes.     I am really sorry, Chair.  It is not my intention but it is Advocate Seleka who wants to know these details.  Unfortunately, they are Zulu names.       I cannot change them.     No, I cannot change them.     Ja.     Ja, it may happen that the parents were expecting ...[intervenes]      ...a girl.     It is now a boy.     So they were disappointed.     But it is a boy.     [No audible reply]      129.  I am there, Chair.     Number?     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     [No audible reply]      If you take it back in 2012, a local area like the Free State, there were many youngsters who would have not had the luxury of a computer, Chair.     Yes, I offered my gadget.     Chair, yes, that is correct.     Yes.     Yes     Yes.     Well, as this thing ...[intervenes]      ...as this thing stands, I remember I did say in this Commission, Chair ...[intervenes]      ...that I was not privy ...[intervenes]      ...to the information.     ...for the choir to perform ...[intervenes]      ...what they needed to perform, yes.     There is evidence, Chair, from my side...[intervenes]      [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]      ...that I paid for my trip, my accommodation and everything.     There was no need ...[intervenes]      ...for the three of us ...[intervenes]      ...to be put in sharing or not sharing because we were not part ...[intervenes]      ...of the arrangement of ...[intervenes]     ...this itinerary.     Yes.     Of the choir?    No.     H’m.     Yes, Chair.     Chair, I do not know where they got this from.  Despite that fact, as Chair has indicated, this email seems to be a copy of the email which was sent, the Gmail which was sent.  It is not an original document from my gadget.  It is a copy of which I may not be privy in terms of the amendments that were made to that copy.  All what I know is that, at any stage I did not submit my name to the choir for – to this trip.  I did say on record, the last time when we were here, that my wild thought was that – because I performed about two songs with the choir, which I said earlier on, they thought maybe I will join them.  And I think that is what I can speculate up to this far, Chair.  Yes.     Chair ...[intervenes]      That happened a long time ago.  Perusing the information by Mr Theron, to my best recollection, that was on a weekend.       So that I do not come in here and explain why I worked on a weekend.     ...they not be saying when I come here, Chair.     So it was a weekend and if I recall, we had a programme somewhere in Thabo ...[indistinct] and the choir was performing there.       In that function ...[intervenes]      It was a department function.     The function, yes.     So I was busy doing something.  So I lent the gadget to lend a hand.  That is what I know, Chair.     No.     I have said that is my suspicion.     I do not know, Chair.  I was not part of this arrangement.     The department.    In this ...[intervenes]      You said it is 319?  219?     [No audible reply]      The information that I was given starts from 235.     236...     I requested for this information, Chair.     I am no longer in that department.     As I have said the last time when I was here.     But give me some time.     So whatever was given to me, I make surethat I try and help the Commission ...[intervenes]      ...to understand where I am coming from.     Yes.  There is a – 241, the approval ...[intervenes]      Yes.     [No audible reply]      This is the proof, Chair that – I think this document has to do with subsistence(?) and travelling.     It is proof that the department for this trip paid for my subsistence and travelling.     I think this – my – let me say, Chair.  The documents, as they are, we normally do not get to that ...[intervenes]      ...level of detail ...[intervenes]      ...as ...[intervenes]      ...MEC’s.     And this Commission makes – need to get to those details.  I may not be spot on.     But my suspicion is that this transaction log sheet was delayed and was only fit in after some time when I was even back from my trip to India.     Ja.     Yes.     That is correct, Chair.     This – I think this is the amount, Chair.     To the best of my knowledge, is that, this is – there is a formula of calculating this amount that will include the currency of the country where you are going ...[intervenes]      ...compared to the currency of the country where you are departing from.  So ...[intervenes]      No, Chair.  Let me not speculate.     I think it is seven thousand.     Two hundred and ninety-five.    Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, yes, I see that.    What must I answer, Chair?     The trip indeed was, according to the approval, was meant to take place from the 15 t h to the 23 r d and Chair, I must indicate that I do not have an answer in terms of this question.     This is what I know about – but to the best of my recollection maybe the itinerary of the choir might be the one which is faulty.  To the best of my recollection, that is the recollection.  I may be wrong, I am happy to…     Acknowledge that point.  It is – ja.     Yes because according to my itinerary I had an engagement of the 22 n d.    Yes.     Yes.     I think the Chair is correct, yes.     Yes, Chair.     There are two issues here, Chair.     I thought earlier on I was asked a question whether the choir travelled on the 13 t h.     No, I am just saying on this issue …[intervenes]     What the Chairperson is raising.     There is a difference there.  Number two …[intervenes]     Ja.    Number two, if you look at 241.     353.241.     I had a clear itinerary.     2.3, Chair.     241, point 2.3, down there.     The page [intervenes]    241.     Down there, 2.3.     I am saying 2.3 will give indication to this Commission about my business in India.     Yes.     Yes, I do, Chair.     I am also not sure whether I was right when I said we travelled together on the 15 t h.     I think we must change that point.     But, Chair, the issue here as raised by Mr Theron was that I travelled together with the choir …[intervenes]     At the expense of the Guptas.     That was an issue and I have since in this Commission, I reflected that that is not correct.  The issue that we are talking about now, it is beyond my control.  In a plane as you go to India or China or anywhere, there areobviously people in that plan which have booked themselves going where they are going.  Some are going where you are going and they are from South Africa.  I have met a number of people on my various trips whom I know.  Where are you going?  I am going to China or Russia.  When are you coming back?  Maybe there will be a difference of two, three days.  That to me is not an issue, I think what I was trying to reflect in this Commission is that the assertions as made by Mr Theron, because I think Mr Theron is the reason why we had to get to this point, I am not correct.     Yes.     Can I get the page, sorry?     Point .21?     And this is Annexure NDZ?     Okay, okay Chair.     Point .21?     Okay I found it.     Yes.     As shown in my itinerary I was going to meetwith different Ministers and …[intervenes].     Ja, it was two Ministers…[intervenes].     Yes.     Different states yes.     I should also indicate, Chair, that in that itinerary I was scheduled to go and see the plant in Paras.    Ja.     When I was there, I think the CEO of the company was not available.     So that trip did not materialise.     Ja, ja of Paras.     Did not materialise, that is why consistently in my affidavit I have been saying I’ve never been to Paras.     And I’ve never been there, but just to complete the question you have asked, Chair, after the announcement of Mahoma Mobung there were actually a number of projects in that Mahoma Mobung concept.     And they were divided in terms of the districts of the province.     I can recall, we had vegetable farming, we had fishery, we had meat, we had sheep farming just to mention, but a few.  We will collaborate with any countrywho shows interest in those projects.  So, as I went out, it’s not only India, I remember that the fishery was, at some point finally supported by the Chinese and it happened.  As to how far it is now, I can’t tell, I know that the poultry was also supported by a company called VKB in the Free State and a number of farmers, have, since benefitted out of that project, so that was the aim, Chair, thank you.     Yes, that’s right Chair.     There were four Chair.     I think we are using the fourth one, I can quickly…[intervenes].     There were actually three Ministers I was supposed to meet with Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, it was open for me, yes Chair.     Yes, yes.     No, thanks Advocate Seleka.  Chair, I did say, indeed, one or two occasions I did go and watch the choir performing, I did say that in this Commission.  Normally if you have meetings back-to-back like this you have information, you come back, you process it, if there’s any issue that you need to follow up, then you have the day to do that follow up so that when you come back and give a report, you have tried your level best to actually give account fruitfully.  So, normally those days we’ll then deal with, how was the trip, how was the meeting, do we need to make a follow up when we are still here, on any other issue, call back home if you need to call back home and get some more information and provide, yes.     I did say last time, Chair when I was here, that I did meet with the choir once or twice,  yes.     Yes, I did indicate that the top official there, I think the CEO was not available, he had some urgent matters to attend to.     The purpose was that, because I was already going to India for these others, check for myself in terms of the report that I got from the officials about the capacity that Paras has, by and large, that was the purpose, Chair.     We were informed that Paras had capacity in terms of quantities, milk quantities, it also had a rise in terms of marketing, selling milk and I thought, when I was there, I may as well verify the report that was given to the Executive and myself, in terms of Paras.     That is why I wanted to meet with the topofficial and just ascertain whether we were in the right direction.     No, Chair I don’t remember those details.     I know he did go.     Yes.    Yes, that’s correct.     Even if I was to be the first to go, he would have already had information.     About this Paras.     Unfortunately, I don’t agree Chair.     My role is to play oversight.     Even on these issues that there is a report that there is a black file with white papers.     As I get a chance to play an oversight.     It is important for me to go and see whether this file exists.     It is in the condition that I was told it is and those details.     Yes.     Hence I’ve raised an issue of an oversight, Chair.     Yes.    No.     Chair, let me just…[intervenes].      Let me just make a practical example Chair.    In the space where I’m working, the Department of Transport through its entity having acquired a property in the airport in Brazil long before I become the Chairperson there.  We normally apply to go on oversight to go and see this property whether it exists…[intervenes].     Whether what is on the paper is on the ground.     That is normally a known.     It’s actually better if everything has been signed because you’re not seen as a politician running ahead of you in terms of these processes in terms of PFMAthat may not need you to be there.     In terms of the …[indistinct], once those processes are done then we can come in and say, indeed there is this there is this, but you said that was there and it’s not there.     ja.     .340 okay.     Yes, I’m there.     There was information as I get it here.     About this Paras having this quantities and so forth and so, where did that information come from?    May I answer Chair?     That is not his role to play, oversight.  Oversight is always played by politicians, officials implement.  I see nothing wrong about this trip, I must say, if in his mind, he wanted to make sure before he appoints these people that, indeed, what is said about them does exist, he was free to go to India.     Yes, I do remember vividly what happened there Chair.     And I did, on several occasions painted that picture and you will see in my affidavit, I have been very consistent.  I have said to this Commission that there was a practice up until I left Free State, that if you are going on a trip as a department, after all your arrangement there was a section in the – associated with the Premier ’s department not office, department called International Relations.  They would always recommend an official to accompany you who will be conversant, for example, if we go to China, there were people who were trained inMandarin in China who would be able to take you through tradition and customs in China and be able to interpret the Mandarin, that was the practice.  It did not need a Premier to pinpoint an individual, this individual would be recommended to us and when we do our request, which in this case, will obviously be done by him to the Premier then we…[intervenes].     Chair, on the face value it looks strange but the practicalities that puts me here today, if I want to run to the Premier, I wouldn’t be able to prove aspersions cast to me by everybody that I travel to India on a trip all paid by the Gupta’s, no.  so, the paper trail has to be done through correct channels by officials.     Once, the MEC has taken a decision that – I think it is prudent for the department to visit here andthere, then we get into an official process of requesting and that process, indeed, will be overseen by the HOD.     Yes Chair.     I wouldn’t have known details in terms of the nitty gritty’s because that process is not a process we are involved in, Chair but I know, the information and the report, as it was given, was that Paras was a big dairy company who’d assist the project to the level which we wanted it to be, yes.    Chair I am saying the report that we got indicated that Paras had the capacity to deal with the project.  That stemmed from interactions that I was not part of because of PFMA but officials will deal with those detailsin terms of appointing a service provider that is suitable for the project.  Now those details will not be the details that in Paras there is this one and this one and this one it surprises when you are being informed that this is a company that is going to do work, this is the profile of the company and if you have time then you can play an oversight over what you have been told about the company.You do not go back and get details as to the nitty gritty’s in terms of that company who will be sub-contracted, who will be doing this.  Unless there is something that is being raised at a later stage either by Auditor General or Treasurer or somebody saying there is something here then you dig deeper.    Well Chair maybe let me say before we – we get to that point.    It is a fact that my HOD together with Ashok Narayan went to India and went to Paras and this is a fact in terms of the report we got.  That necessitated me when I was going to India to go and verify what was in the report for the longest time I have been under the impression that Paras is the one that is doing work in Vrede on the project called Vrede Dairy.  And until there were issues that were raised byAuditor General I think in mid-2013 I have been operating under that impression.  Yes.    Chair if I was still in the department and in this case unfortunately I was no longer in the department because I left the department early March.      2013.      Yes.    The report of the Auditor General was after when I had left.    And there was subsequently a report I think by Treasury which came at a later stage when I was no longer there.  So the remedial actions would have happened even when I was no longer there.I know as well seated here having read all the information that is before me that there were issues in termsof the contract as you earlier have indicated that there was a contract in June which was subsequently     Replaced by another one and government was involved at a higher – at the highest level in terms of that contract which normally is not in the prevue ordinarily of our sects.  Yes.  In my affidavit the first affidavit I have tried to paint a picture as to the process you iden – you go to the community you identify their needs then you come up with a concept as I have done.   And this concept is tested for a lack of a better word even at the level of the executive after having tested it with the department.  And everybody says no this is a concept that we think it is correct and we can try this concept.  And then thereafter once this concept has passed it went throughthe state of the province which was…    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Chair there was information as I indicated earlier that there is a company called Paras in India which has the capacity to undertake the magnitude of the project that we envisaged.  And as such officials went to India toverify and they came back and they were happy.  Right.  And then the work started internally in terms of administration.    Because normally Chair nobody will be given work without having followed the due processes as we all know that.  So that was my impression about Paras.   Yes.    I do not remember him saying such Chair.    My agreement was based on…    My impression was based on the fact that it was a common cause that there should be processes – due processes that are followed in identifying a service provider.  And that – those processes are then undertaken by HOD assisted by other officials.  And once the HOD has taken all these processes we are ready to move.   We do not many a times get to a point where we areshown contracts or are told about contracts being ready.  In the report normally what comes is that we are going to be working with Paras which in this case was the case I was told.  That is why in October I also wanted to go and play my oversight when I was in India. That is – that is how far I knew about Paras Chair.    We do not normally do that if there is nothing untoward or there is a query raised Chair.    Chair there were a number of contracts that were entered into by the department except this contract.  Those contracts were not shown to us not only me and other MEC’s what you normally get as a report is that here is a service provider who is going to do these things after processes have been undertaken and if you have any questions you do not raise your question at that particular point or if there is any suspicion you then go deep to saywas the due processes followed and how were they – the processes followed?  Reading by any suspicion but if there is no suspicion what you normally do is to ensure that what the HOD has undertaken to do is taking place.    Yes.    Let me revert back to my earlier example of a property owned by ACSA in Brazil. If we apply to go and play our oversight in Brazil it has never happened Chair that we normally would get into the details of saying let us see how the contract – how this property was acquired, the contract and so forth.  We look at the report in front of us and based on that report we take that report with, we go and play our oversight.  If there are issues we pick up there we then come back and say there are these issues give us furtherinformation.  So normally that is how we – we do things.  So it would not have come to me that in this case specifically I must look for a contract before I go there.  Because that has not been the norm.  I do not think any MEC in the Free State has done that Chair.    Fruitless.    Chair let me answer that question simply.    By referring you to page 241 – it is 353.241.      As the Chair has read this letter that goes tothe Premier and the letter is from the HOD. This letter has an itinerary that points me to Paras in October as the Chair is saying. I mean if my assertion in this commission is not right why would in my itinerary rating by the HOD still write Paras.      Yes.    Chair I think your recollection will come handy with what I have referred to the Chair to.    In October already.    Paras was still an entity or a service provider according to my knowledge and impression.    Yes Chair.    No.    No Sir – no Chair.    AI think there was an issue raised by Treasury if I – if I recall well and Estina – that is why the Vrede Dairy    I think it was 20    I think it was 2014.    No I was long gone by then.    Yes.    No Chair.    No Chair not of what I remember.  No.  That is why in October I was still going to Paras.  I would have endeavoured to check where is Estina – what – what does it look like as I play my oversight?    Chair I think this commission will appreciate that I did take an initiative of playing oversight on the information that was before me.  And the evidence is here right in front of the commission.   2. The Chair has just said in terms of his best recollection the HOD when he was here gave an impression that he himself was under that impression that Paras was actually ...[indistinct – word cut off] provider.  Now, Chair, I think Idid indicate this previously that this are the people appointed in terms of their knowledge, skills and qualifications to do this work as given to them by law.  Now if a report comes to me and I follow the report, and as this Commission can see, that I did attempt to go and meet with the service provider and it is here in the itinerary, I would not have, honestly, a view that I was not played my oversight.  If at all, the evidence in this Commission was contrary, even in the terms of the ...[indistinct] understanding that no Estina has always been there and I am talking about – but I will agree with the Chair.  The Chair is saying, in terms of his own recollection, that is what HOD(?) said in this Commission.  And I am saying that is correct.  That was also the information given to me.  So I follow that information and a report was given to me and I played my oversight over the ...[indistinct]  I am not ...[intervenes]      H’m?     Yes, I do.     I am painting a picture here, Chair, that oversight is played in terms of the information that is placed before you.      When you play oversight, you do not go and dig what is not in front of you unless there is an information or somebody has raised an issue in terms of this same report that is in front of you.  The report ...[intervenes]      There is ...[intervenes]      No, Chair it not like that, unfortunately, in the public sector.     You do not ...[intervenes]      Once you know that there are documents that are not given to you, once that comes to your knowledge, you will indeed request for that additional information.  It is a standard in the departments that in a particular time you must get the report in terms of how things are going.  In a particular time, you must then play your oversight based on the report that is placed before you.Now I am saying to this Commission.  Based on the information that was put before me, signed by the HOD about Paras, it is here.  I was going to Paras myself in October to play my oversight because at that particular time there was nothing that was suspicious in terms of the reports.  In fact, on the hindsight, if the meeting with Paras I had, had materialised I would have picked it up there that no I am knocking at the wrong door.  Yes.And I would have without any hesitation acted and then I would have then gone to what the Chair is     Chair, I did say the CEO was not available.  Something urgent had cropped up.  I did say that.      [No audible reply]     Okay?     Can I answer?     Thank you very much, Advocate Seleka.     The information that this Commission should have is that when this project was approved by Exo there were issues, number one, that had to be looked into by the committee, Treasury Committee.     Okay.     I may – I am taking a long route.  Let me be short.     And get to that particular point.  I made a call to the CFO.  It was on Friday afternoon.  I think she has also said that.     That I was supposed to report.  We had Exco on every Wednesday.  I am supposed to go back to Exco and report in terms of the work done since the last...  And he then raised the issue that Treasury seems to be still busy in terms of what they need to...  I then called the    I asked the CFO to join the MEC of Treasury with his team.  He had given me a venue where they were meeting.  They were in a meeting when I talked to him.  He     The progress in terms of what needed to be done by the committee and the department pertaining the project.  Let me just, maybe for the sake of viewers.  There was an issue of R 84 million that the Treasury Committee had to look into.  There was an issue of our R 30 millionthat our department had said – the Department of Agriculture – it is available.  Now looking at the magnitude of what was needed and Treasury had to look into.  We had to go back to Exco and say it is feasible or is not feasible or we need to buy more time in terms of allowing officials to work on     Treasury was looking into the feasibility of getting this R 84 million.  Thirty ...[intervenes]      For the project.     Yes.     That email, to the best of my recollection Chair.       The department was required to reprioritise within the department.     It is that reprioritisation that would go back to Exco to talk about.  It is also about the feasibility of the R 84 million that will bring the whole annual amount of this project to R 140 million.       So my was that, let us not be found wanting on oversight in terms of giving information.    That was the essence of the call.       I do not know whether to call it Estina or Paras.      It is like the issue of the choir ...[intervenes]      Oh, but like – let me accept, Chair.     After this discussion ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Ja.     Vrede Dairy Project.     That was the arrangements in terms of finances of that project, yes.     I take it Chair that the leader of evidence here has just reported that this was a project recently approved.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.    Yes.     That is right.     It ...[intervenes]      It can depend, Chair, in terms of the prioritygiven to the project.     This project, as it was approved, there was urgency attached to it.     It is there in the minutes of Exco.     And once you have that – and it was a reflection(?) project that was also announced in the state of the province of the Premier.     So it will ...[intervenes]      It will gave that priority that anytime when you are given a task to perform, you must be ready thatyou should report ...[intervenes]      Not even regularly.  There might be a     You should not be found wanting.     So that was the drive in terms of this project, Chair.     You must be up to date.     Anytime.     Yes.     Chair, maybe I must try and give some more information on that.     I think around March/April ...[intervenes]      2012.     In my speech, as an MEC now of Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, I tabled this project,not in February.  March/April.  Right?  And once I have tabled – the Premier will come with a helicopter view of what the department will do and that but the department will then give details during their presentation.This is a project that was announced by the Premier around March or late February, let us say so.  Our department in around April and after April, when the project has been announced by the department, work would start to happen.  Then it is May/June going forward.In fact, if you come from that point, you will see that from April to June(?), it was two months.  June to September, four months.  November six months.  Around April, you see ...[intervenes]      Yes.    The following year.  Now, for all intense and purposes, Chair, I did what I could.  I do not want to cast suspicions because I do not like that happening to me also but I give what was brought to me and I acted upon it.     That is correct, Chair.     Point?     Four, zero, nine?     Yes, Chair?     Mohai.     Yes.     H’m.  Yes, Chair.    We did not have sufficient venues so it was a normal practice in the Free State to do that.  It is save to say, this was not my meeting, Chair.  Before I cast suspicions or – this was the meeting organised by Treasury.  I just requested my official to join them.  I may not know the details.      I am just relating that that was a no.     Ja.  We used to do that in the Free State.     Can I respond?     Thank you very much, Chair.  I think I had already responded to this question in terms of my call tothe CFO.  My call was never about the payment of any money to anybody.  My call was about the progress that I needed to report back to Exco, as I have said.  So that is what I want to put on record to this Commission.       The meeting is about Treasury and Agriculture preparing any response, should it be needed, in the next meeting.  It was the next Wednesday.  About two aspects.The reprioritisation of projects within the department itself to the tune of R 30 million.     And the issue of R 84 million.       My call was about that.  It was not about paying anybody.  That is not my purview.  To the best of my recollection, I have not seek to interfere unless there is somebody who has not been paid within the period that we have said people should be paid in – in respect of this case it was 30-days.       Chair, can I interject?     Yes, thank you.     Thank you, Chair.     Re-prioritisation.     360?     No, I do not have.  I do not have any comment, Chair.     Chair, I think the urgency I did say was in fact from the executive committee.  In the affidavit of MrVenter, the minutes of the executive committee, I think it is point 3, it says – it talks about the urgency of this project being implemented.  That is what I was mentioning.       Ja.     Yes, Chair, I do understand, but I am not privy to …[intervenes]    Ja, no, I am not privy to that.     I did say, I needed to be ready for feedback in terms of the decisions taken …[intervenes]     I have indicated that both ourselves and Treasury were given tasks and I have indicated those tasks, Chair, and I also indicated that on our side I did not want us to be found lacking as the Department of Agriculture in terms of what was given us as a task before the next executive committee meeting.     So she also talks about Paras.       Yes.  No, I was just indicating that seemingly there is consistency in terms of this issue of Paras from the prior presentation but let me answer your question, Chair.       I think I did …[intervenes]    We, as the department …[intervenes]     I am sure in this case.     And it will further cascade down to PFMA in terms of arrangements of payment, arrangements of the process plan when it comes to this project.  So the nitty gritties in terms of how this was arranged should actually be the work of the HOD assisted of course by officials like CFO which I have indicated earlier on that I had not seen the contract and those details I am sure would have been contained in the contract.     No, I am not able to say why.     And why was it supposed to be paid up front.     I am not able to say why.     No, Chair, it is not like that.  I think there are roles and responsibilities in government which at a particular point I must hand over to the officials.  The issues of procurement in the main according to a PFMA are not my purview, it is a purview that is being practised and monitored by officials.  I do get in there if there are issuesand those issues are raised with me, I do get - and ask the same officials to do their work.  There is no way where you can find me as an MEC dealing with prepayment and stuff like that, it is not my purview.  To the best of my recollection I was on the ball and in that process I had to allow officials to do what is delegated to them in terms of the law and I guess the issue we are talking about here is actually a delegations of officials, it is not my responsibility.     I think the question is well apprised in terms of the processes which were followed in the Free State, every contract had to actually be seen by the State Law Adviser before it could be implemented.  The to and fro engagements between the department and the department – in this case the Department of Agriculture and the StateLaw Adviser’s office which actually be an issue of the finalisation of legality in terms of the contract and that falls squarely at the doorstep of the HOD.     I have since saw that during this process as I was forwarded with documentation.  Yes, I saw it.     Well, you want me to comment in terms of the contract and who was appointed.  Let me give you theprocess.     Chair, I did say up until October 2012 I have always been under the impression that Paras is the implementer of this project, that is why I highlighted this issue now after break that even the CFO seemed to raise that matter consistently about Paras.  So I was not aware.    I have since read about it, yes, that is why I thought in terms of the process this matter should have been corrected.     Once it is detected.     The people responsible should have been held responsible.     Accountable in terms of what has happened.  Yes.     That is so, Chair, according to the legal prescripts that are clearly tabulated.  Should there be anything untoward, there should be somebody who is being held accountable to explain what has happened and so forth and so on.  I do acknowledge that fact.    I did read that, yes, Chair.      Can I say something?     Chair, I think this Commission should have been furnished by an agreement between the department of Free State government and the beneficiaries.  As far as I can recall and to the best of my knowledge, the beneficiaries were to benefit from the real activities of Vrede Dairy.  That will include the milking parlour, that willinclude the processing of milk and they will also benefit in the process of completion of the value chain when by-product are also produced in Vrede.  So from milking, processing milk and production of by-product, that is the closest where these beneficiaries, as farmers, as owners of the business will benefit.  That is as far as I know.  I do not recall at any moment where beneficiaries were to benefit in the establishment of the project.My understanding is that once there is a service provider who will be developing this Vrede Dairy.  This service provider accordingly will have to bring materials and all those other things and do – according to the process plan between him or herself with the department and then the service provider will get paid for what they have performed.  That is my understanding of this project.  I do not know if I amclarifying your concern.      Chair, on the occasions I went there milkwas sold from the dairy parlour.  By the time when the parlour was producing this I should indicate in this Commission that I was no longer in the department, so that that is the – but on the few occasions that I went there, milk was sold and I assumed that nobody will be barred from buying milk there and I would not be able to give you the details in terms of how much people have benefitted because I think when the [indistinct] rewrote her report the process was at the level where milk processing was to be completed.  The third layer, which was the production of by-product, up until today has not happened.  So there is a possibility, I assume, that – because of the value chain have not - up until today has not happened, so there is a possibility I assume that because of the value chain have not – that people have not benefited as they weresupposed to.   I think one issue I am picking up here Chair, I got into the statement of Mr Hlongwane and Dlamini, is an issue of communication in terms of how far is the project, if people have not benefited up to now, what are the hiccups, Because I think that should actually be communicated to them.     That is correct, Chair.     I was moved to economic development.      For two, three months, yes.      Yes, I was not far, that is true.     That was my view and it is still my view.     Yes.     There was no position to protect at that point. I was already not there.     I was already gone from this department.  I was not involved Chair, in the procurement of.     From what?     I have read about those allegations, I can say to this Commission , one of the people who had made those allegations has since came back to me, Mr Gadebe and I have   tabulated in my affidavit that Mr Gadebe is a former ANC member who went to DA and I do not want to bring people's names here, as they did without anyevidence on my name because I respect that part but leaders of a certain party went to Estina Project according to what he is telling me and when they were there, they said they must try and expose whatever they can find, especially tarnish my name. Now, I asked him, why are you coming to me now when you have gone to the Commission and said what you said, and I did not respond and I did not act.  He says what they had been promised has not been fulfilled and I said, no, it is not my purview, I do not want to involve myselfthere, Chair. But the fact Chair, is that Mr Gadebe and I think Mr Dlamini made serious allegations in terms of me assassinating people, and I would really appreciate it if those allegations could be tested because I think it is unfair that such serious allegations can just be made without any evidence.  The point is, they are still living, they are in fear and nothing has happened to them after them saying if anybody touches my name then they are sure to be killed. The people they are raising here, were actually officials of the department, stationed in Vrede so when meetings in terms of this project were called their officials will be there and some councillors of which Mr Gadebe at some point was one of the councillors.  I should put it onrecord that when this project was proposed, I think the municipality brought evidence to the fact that the municipality council did agree 100% with this project, and he was part.  The issue of the cattle which died was a national issue, it was publicised, it is well known.  We went to there as Free State Government to check what was the cause, so it is not an issue that somebody could have tried to shield anything there.  If a project is there and something goes wrong there is nothing to shield but to correct the misnomers, because it is notabout me, it is about the community, which must benefit.  If the contractor is not doing right, the contractor must be attended to, to correct or remove, it is as simple as that.      No Chair.     I do not recall.      Yes, Chair.      Chair, it was not a norm for a contract to bepresented at the executive, at the executive there will be a memo, the short summary of what you want to communicate and in this case, as I look at this, one of the issues that necessitated a memo to the executive it is point     No, I think Chair earlier on I did highlight the fact that the two officials excluding myself that is the HOD and the CFO, for a long time have been understanding or having an impression that the department has contract withParas. If this was presented earlier on and corrected that this is not Paras this is Estina I think the whole process that we talked about earlier on would not even have taken place, should if I had known that it is Estina.    If what…[intervene]     Mr Thabetha said that there was no contract between Paras and the department my assumption would be that.     No, Chair I understand what the Chair is saying.     Chair, the approval of my trip to India was approved in the office of the Premier where Ms Rodman is and this approval had Paras, nobody said no wait.  It was instant approved, I went to India and if the officials were available there I would have gone when everybody knew. Coming back to this information Chair, I have read this information I have read even the part of Mr Venter in terms of the to and fro of agreements, where there are noproper contracts and subsequently, a new contract being entered into, I have read that now.  But at the time when these things were happening, it was between officials, my officials who let me to go to India to Paras and the officials of the Premier's department I now know that Ms Rockman also knew about this issue and this issue big as it is, it should actually gone to Eskom because the next version will be when payment was supposed to be done around June on what was that payment going to be done, if there was no contract.  These are the issues that I am saying, if they were brought to light, I am sure I would have dealt with them.  Let me speak on my behalf, I would have dealt with them, yes Chair.    Chairperson I think this issue we have repeated – repeated it for some time now and the simple explanation I have given and I think Chair alluded to it many times Mr Thabethe himself says in this commission according to your recollection that he was under the impression thatParas had something to do with this.     It is ..    It is on record.  It is not me saying it is – Chair’s recollection.  The leader of evidence here also says at some point Ms Dlamini paints that particular picture.  Right.  These are two senior officials in my department  It is not – it is not as if everybody including my officials in the department were saying Estina I am the only one who saysParas.  I have produced in this commission evidence that I was pointed to Paras late in…    He did not know.    May you please accept Chair my version.    Which I have backed up.    By my itinerary to India visiting Paras that indeed I was going to visit Paras.      Yes.    Ja, ja.    Yes.   I appreciate that Chair.    Yes I saw those allegations Chair.    As I have said earlier on that was not my responsibility as a MEC I would not know.    I did answer that question Sir.  I said Chair I said I do not know.    Paras?    On which basis?    Chair – no I am…    I am saying Chairperson it has gone to length in terms of Estina – Estina and read.      Yes, no I am saying the issue of Paras is what I have said was the presentation that Paras is going to be doing – to be a service provider that is what I have said.  And the details of what will happen between the department and Paras I do not know because I have said earlier on I didnot see the contract.    If my memory serves me well Chair there was an understanding that if we reprioritise projects in the department we will be able to get up to R30 million which I have said earlier on is the money that we needed to prioritise that is why I called the CFO.  There was another R84 million which was given as a task to the treasurycommittee to try and find money for that project. That is what I have said.  Yes.    No in terms of the – in terms of the information and in terms of EXCO meeting there was going to be a shortfall that we know hence the creation of the treasury committee 84 million was to be sourced out if I may use that word from the province other departments and the    I think this project was for three years if I am not mistaken R114 million every year times 3 that was the cost of the project.    Yes.    Yes.    That – that was exactly my understanding Chair.    Yes.    No I never got that Chair.   No.    Chair well I am recollecting from my memory this project is seven/eight years.    I may not be precise.    Yes.   I do not recall – I do not recall it in this point that is raised I think the whole debate is about this point.    Of that I was contributing money ja.    These are two different issues Chair.    The Chair has asked me whether the total cost was going to come from the provincial government.    I have said that was my understanding.    I have said it was my understanding that atleast for 2012 we were supposed to go and reprioritise and get to the value of 30 million from our own department and then 84 would then be a responsibility of the treasury committee.  I did allude to that fact – to those facts.    In the province.    Yes.    No to make 114.    30 plus 84.   Yes Chair.    There is…    Yes.    Can we go to the place Chair where there is    Where there is a EXCO resolution of Mr Nhlabe.    Ms Rothman.    I think I am trying to attempt to …   Ja it is…    It is page 381 - .381.    Yes.    Vrede Integrated Dairy Agri Business.    3.1    I am reading there.    There are actually two 3.1’s I was reading at the second one.      That says Vrede Integrated Dairy Agri Business Project propose integration dairy and other elements of production and processing with emphasis of value addition and beneficiation that is me.  MEC Agriculture and Rural Development.“The executive council approved the following recommendation by the department.  The implementation of the proposed agri dairy project supports the sourcing of additional funding of 84 million for the current financial year.”I think the question is around here.  And this 84 million it says  “Where possible the department should meet the costs and will be later refunded and engage other relevant departments.”That is EXCO Chair. “The matter be further discussed in the treasury committee as a matter of urgency.”Now as I understand the leader of evidence is thatwe as the department was supposed to reprioritise.  I did not have a problem with that to put it on record.      `No that – that instruction would have come after the EXCO resolution Chair.  I will tell you why.    It would …   It will come from – the direction is from EXCO.    Me and HOD.    Were most of the time part of EXCO.    HOD after EXCO has taken a decision where he is present should make sure that the decision of EXCO is implemented.    They should not wait for me.  In case where the HOD was not there I am alone I would go back and ..    Convey to the department through the HOD the resolution of the EXCO.     That is what I am saying Chair.    It is not correct Chair.    The EXCO made a decision that we should go and reprioritise source some funds even if it means us being refunded by other departments.  We could reprioritise 30 million in the department not because – not because of the advance payment. Because of the total whole sum of the project an 84 will then be arranged by the treasury committee.    Chair in terms of the concept of the project it was done in 2011 consultation and everything done and dusted.  In terms of the financial planning on the hindsightas I look on in all these papers that is the picture that is painted by this project.  But let me hasten to say I think on several occasions where we had to sit down and agree maybe in lekgotla by that lekgotla that comes late January early February where we prepare for the state of the province address.At that point with a month to go a collective then decides that this project will be more – will give more value rather than these others small projects.  Then at that point a decision will be taken for us to support this bigger project that we all agree that it will put moving.In terms of other planning I agree with the Chair it looks clumsy but there are records to that extent not once – not twice where when we meet in – by the lekgotla there will be a reprioritisation of some sort.  Yes.    Can I speculate?     Because ...[intervenes]      In the Leghotla planning, the department will be requested to propose mega projects in the Department of Agriculture.  There was an issue, even before I arrived, that the department was doing small projects that do not have the necessary intact.  As this Commission has evidence to the fact that everybody that came to thisCommission agreed that the concept and the project were brilliant.We saw this concept at Leghotla, Project Leghotla.  Then Leghotla, as a collective, bought in to the idea and saw this project as one of the projects that could prioritised.  That is what happened and that is why the project was first announced in the State of the Province Address and then by us.  From our side as a concept we were ready Chair.  In terms of planning, as the Chair is saying, on hindsight looking at what has happened, I take that point but as I have said this is how we used to do things at that point in time, Chair.     Yes.     No, Chair.     I think honestly the Commission is abusing my generosity.     I honestly think so.       My organisation and myself have undertaken to help this Commission.    And I never failed.     I have cooperated.  Chair, to be quite frank.  We started at issues that I was here last for.  Now I am just really beginning to ask myself.     What is this Commission looking from me?  Because the Commission gives a document an afternoon before I come here.  I come entirely come and do my best.     Now ...[intervenes]      ...let me request, Chair.     Cooperation from the Commission.     I think this is ...[intervenes]      Yes, please.       I take off.     I take days off ...[intervenes]     ...from my work.     And I do not know anymore ...[intervenes]      ...what to say, really.     So I will humbly request Chair that let us try and finish.     Can I say something?     No, Chair I appreciate that consideration.  I am not raising this out of bad faith.  I am raising this because it is my experience that most of the time I spent more time with the Commission repeating what I have already said on record.  If there is anything in that respect, my expectation is that we will go to that issue, deal with it.     But not repeat the whole section.     But I really appreciate the consideration.     Thank you.     Okay?    I know it now, Chair.     I know it know.     I did not know it.     No.     Yes, I know that.     I have read about it.    No.     I did not know and to be short about it.  Where there are instances where correct processes will not be followed, the department through the HOD explains it the following year when there is the report of the Auditor General why this has happened, give reasons.  So provide all those reasons.  When this report came out, I was no longer there in that department.    I did say Paras, Chair.     Except on the hindsight, having known all these issues, this project was badly managed.     Yes.     The information I have is Estina as I havegone through.     Ja.     Now what must I say to you?     Well, my view is that, as I have said, this project was badly managed.  Should the management of the project been done well, this project, from where I am sitting, regarded as one of the best projects in agriculture to have happened for the people of the Free State.  That ismy view.     Chairperson, I do not call somebody by his clang name unless I appreciate how he treats me.     And this morning I have called you by your clang name.     To be quite frank, Chair.     Despite what I have raised, we are have been working very well with you.    And I must put it on record.  That is why I am trying to raise ...[intervenes]      ...whatever I am ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Thank you, Chair.     225?     224?     [No audible reply]      Oh, okay.     I am sorry, Chair.       Nine point...?     Yes, Chair.     Yes, it is.     2013 or ’14?     This is the trip of the travel agents. ADV SELEKA     Okay.       Well, Chair I am going to say that it is not clearly stipulated.  That when you read my affidavit, I say Ideny that at any stage during my tenure as the MEC in the Free State Provincial Government, I ever attended a wedding of any of the Gupta family.  And I say so with confidence in that I was not friends with the Guptas.     Chair, this is the third affidavit.  Consistently in all my affidavits.  I hear what the leader of evidence issaying and I take note of that.  I have been consistent that I have known – actually ...[intervenes]      ...I must not say the Gupta family.     I have known Tony and I have explained that I have known Tony because of the paper in the Free State ...[intervenes]      And I have said I have not met with him outside the environment of me doing my work in the organisation or in government.That has been my assertion.  So I see this qualification and I wish to correct it.     No, I was not.     In regards ...[intervenes]      Yes.     He says it is the meaning of friend.     That is what I have read, Chair.     This what I have read here is not information [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]    Chair, thank you.  Let me just thank the Chair, I think this was a point which made us to adjourn last time.    I should indicate, Chair, that the affidavit and her statement, I received that affidavit yesterday afternoon.     Yesterday afternoon and then I received the statement this morning but due to my commitment from myparty that I will always cooperate with this Commission and to you, Chair, that I took your advice when you say I must try and say something.  I have tried and collected all the information, as you can see the information that was not last time, it is here.  I would have loved to also had enough time but due to the predicament that the Chair raised of timeframes of the Commission I thought I should say in this Commission I will give it my best in terms of my recollection but I would have loved a situation where I would have also had a situation where I can prove what I am saying.  I will continue to try and source this information even when the Commission …[intervenes]     Yes.  Chair …[intervenes]    Yes, Chair.     I am not blaming anybody, Chair.    I am just putting a record.     And my willingness to cooperate even under these difficult circumstances to help the Commission.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  Chair, I know what I have said on these issues, I have reflected on this matter last time because I had committed that I will come back and ignore the issues – let me put the record straight, it was not my intention to contest the emails.  That is why I am cooperating today, trying to assist the Commission.  The issue was getting some sufficient time which I can see it isnot possible even today to try and prepare myself around to be of assistance to this Commission.  That is why I am here.  I thought I should clarify that.     Chair, having said that, having reflected during these few days before I came here, indeed there was a trip I took.  I remember the trip which seeks to go – and at this point in time I was in Economic Development.  I did meet with investors in Dubai, I did meet with investors in India, I did go to Switzerland, as a business trip, as youcan see it was pointed in different directions.  I do not wish to contest anybody’s affidavit.   What I want to put as a point and fact in this Commission is that throughout my tenure as MEC and the Minister and even in the ANC, when there is a trip that is undertaken, once that trip is approved, it was a norm that officials will then deal with issues of booking, whether they use travel agent, whether they pay themselves, that was not upon me.  So it was my assumption all the time that that has been the norm, hence I was able to prove in the earlier circumstances.  In this case also, that has been an assumption.  I want to say to this Commission, under no circumstances I would allowed a situation knowingly where a third party will be involved to pay my own travel arrangement whether itbe in a form of refund or otherwise because the norm and assumption has always been the organisation or the department I am representing should be the one that will always take care of my travelling arrangements.  I wish to put that on record, Chair, otherwise I will continue to try and source …[intervenes]     Information, where I can source information.     I thought I should deal with that in that way.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I will continue to do so, Chair.     And I am saying upon realising this information, as it is here, properly recorded, I had always had an assumption that the department or organisation where I am will be the one that is responsible to undertake those nitty gritties in terms of ensuring that I arrive where I am going.     Thank you, Chair.     No.     No, Chair.      And, Chair, I do not know how – even the method of payment.     Who paid this travel agent.     Those details that due to time constraints I may not want to bore the Commission with, I thought I should make that presentation in this Commission.    I have already enquired, Chair, I must say I will add some information but as I got it this morning and yesterday, to try and close this matter and assist theCommission to know what happened.     I think the department it has not changed, Chair, it is called the Department of Economic Development and Environmental affairs.     Thank you, Chair.     Chair…?    You are 261 point?     Point 6?     Halima Allana.     Chair, I said – thank you, Chair.  Am I to answer one question or all of them?     Okay, Chair.  I did say I did not know Salim.  In fact this who affidavit raises an interest also from me.  I confirm that I do not know this lady called Halima, I have not spoken to her.  I must also confirm in this Commission that I also did not speak to Salim.  As I have indicated, the person I knew I was talking to was Thuli(?) but let me also then respond to the issue, how would they have known?  Chair, I have said it is my assumption, up to my, including this trip, that once the trip is set, the nitty gritties will bedone by the department.  The presence of my password, as you see it, in my mind alludes to that fact because it was there, I would ensure that it is available in the department during the course of them doing whatever work they need to do.   I will also want to raise my interest in terms of actually who paid for this trip.  I think it is also important for me because my assumption has always been, to the best of my recollection, my belief and my knowledge, that the department will be doing this work and once tickets arehere, I will get into the plane and go.  So it raises those issues even to me, Chair.  I cannot respond how did she know, as a travel agent, yes.     That will be the case, Chair.     That will be the case, ja.  I would not know because those details are not the details that will be followed by me as an MEC.    Yes, I knew him very well Chair.   I can’t remember Chair, I can’t remember seeing him.  I also cannot deny that he was on the plan, but what I know is what I already communicated to the commission that I did not instruct anybody to do this.     Yes Chair I think that’s the route in terms of ...[intervenes]      I remember that I did go to Zurich.     And back home.     I think it is from Dubai.     Chair I wouldn’t be asked to speculate, this is a proper speculation and I think let me not waste time.     I will have to get in touch with them, but I no longer have their details as I am no longer Minister of Minerals, so I will do the best that I can Chair.     Thank you.     Chair I will endeavour to do my best.     Yes, I will collect whatever I can get, yes.     Chair let me also thank you, I really have learnt a lot interacting with you and your time, I wish that this Commission can bear fruits for the country as we are moving forward and as I have said I will continue to cooperate with the Commission and give it my best shot, all the best Chair.  I know your work is not as easy as we see you on television there, there is a lot that is going on behind the scenes.Otherwise from my side I want to thank you for the opportunity of giving me to explain my side of the story, I think that goes a long way, and thank you for the opportunity once more, to your leaders of evidence I do not have a complaint, I really want to appreciate that opportunity, thank you Chair.

ZWANE:But as to what they had in mind...[intervenes]   I just made my gadget available...[intervenes]   He would have had information…[intervenes].  We normally do that in our work as…[intervenes].  No Chair, I don’t remember me recommending – in fact, we don’t dictate to officials as to how they do their work especially when it comes to issues of third parties who are appointed in a process that we are not party to.  We normally don’t involve ourselves.  No, I am ready for the question, Chairperson.  Ja, according to this information ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA:  Is flight the equipment, Boeing 77 – okay let’s see Mr Zwane, let’s see – look at the first one, the 13 t h of September 2014, so on page – the one of Salim Essa, 261.10, against the entry equipment, okay flight, sowe can look at flight, AK762 Emirates, it is the same Chair,

MR KOKO:   Good afternoon Chair.     Matshela Moses Koko.     No.     Yes.     So help me God.    I am there, I’m there Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Chair the letter of award you have it asevidence before this Commission, is dated the 17 t h of December 2015.   We could not have got to that point of the letter of award unless we have met the ...[indistinct] and compliance to National Treasury Regulations are at ...[indistinct] so for – when we had the first steering committee, I think it was in January, an impression was made ...[intervenes]      It is 2015, one five.     Right.   The impression that was put to us when we had the first steering committee by the project manager was that the National Treasury’s compliance is inplace as well.  We also heard evidence and there are affidavits in this Commission, if I recall one is from Mr Mabelane, i think Mr Singh makes the same statements that the contract was actually concluded in January 2016.  At all material times when the question of compliance to National Treasury’s product the only reference that was put to the fore is a letter – is an email between Dave Gorey and Mr Solly ...[indistinct] who was then the CPO, Chief Procurement Officer at National Treasury.Now I have never had sight of that until theproceedings in this Commission and it is what it is before you now, and you see that it is dated the 4 t h, so that’s the only reason why I made that statement and I have said to you I am not going to pass a comment or judgment call on this email, except two things; one it came after the fact and two it is for the lawyers to decide whether this letter gives consent or not but what I can tell you, what I can tell you, is that we came to a realisation sometime in February/March that the National Treasury compliance was not in place so I have no doubt in my mind that certainly I, Matshela Koko, and members of the steering committee and there were ...[indistinct] to us there Chair and one of the problems I have in the proceedings there I seem to be the spokesperson of the Steering Committee and by the way I need to make this clear that the delegations from theBoard was not to the Steering Committee, so you cannot hold the Steering Committee collectively accountable, that is not how Corporate works, but in any event all that I am saying is this letter when I ...[indistinct] was to say to you the people involved when they say we have National Treasury Compliance they all refer to this letter, but it is up to you to make our judgment call whether this letter gives compliance or not, but what I am putting to you is that around February/March I think I used, the term that I used something like the writing was on the wall.    Yes I think I made ...[intervenes]      Yes, February/March the writing was on the wall and I do not recall any dissent that the writing was not on the wall, in other words there was no compliance to National Treasury Regulations and this letter cannot be relied upon.  That is as far as I can put it Chair, I had not seen this letter at that time, I came to know about this letter I think sometime in the Parliamentary file.     Chair when I was here I promised to send you a policy of Eskom, and I said you will not wait long, and Idid exactly that.   I have sent it to ...[indistinct].     Yes and Chair I am happy to go to it to show you that it is not the – it is wrong to say because the contract, the entering into a contract adds problems, in other words because it needs, for lack of a better word, let’s say because it is an irregular contract therefore you are not – you can’t pay the contractor.     You ...[indistinct]      You will be wrong to reach that contract.,    Acted bona fides.     Exactly, and I have also made – I have selected the page, I also quoted ...[indistinct].     It is called an edification policy.     You have to report yourself, you have to go and plead poverty ...[intervenes]     You have to go and say I am guilty ...[intervenes]     And they decide how to deal with you but – and it is written in black and white.     It says, if I may quote    Ja, I am simply saying to you Chair it is not the gospel of Moses, it is what Eskom framework says, unless the other party did not act in good faith, in other words unless the other party was part of ...[intervenes]     Was party to the irregularity then there’s a problem.    Chair I can ...[indistinct]      It is bundle, that is MK49, in Bundle 15.     Give me the page?     Yes, 2.6.7, paragraph ...[intervenes]      Paragraph 8.     Procurement Tender Committee.    But Chair I have to comment.    This interaction is about me you must – you cannot – I may not be there Chair when you – when you deal with it at the end (talking over one another).    But I need to say.    Because of all the people that will be deciding I was the only one who was there.    So at least you need to consider.    My position.  At all material times up until November in my mind – up until …   2015 February/March     At all material …    2016.  The contract was lawful and there was no issue.  Post March the issues of compliance came. There is two issues.  One was National Treasury which was a gate keeper and there was condition precedent that relates to the    I accept that.    But all what I want you to know is that all these issues were ventilated at the board – at the BTC and     Not 2015 but certainly 20    2016.  I have given you a date already.    13 December, 8 August and 21 June.    2016.    All these payments and were condoned for the for lack of a better word at the board and I had nothing to do with them.  Just – I just want you to know that.    Not – thought you were in Bundle 15 – can I put the 15 away?    Page 48.11.1.      Yes.    I am there.    I am there Chair.    I am very familiar with this document.    No Sir.    No Sir.    Commodity sourcing was – it is in Group Commercial.    Group Commercial was in Finance.    I was the Group Executive Technology andCommercial Chair.  When I was with suspension Group Commercial and Technology was split.  The name was kept but Commercial when I came back on the 20t h of July the    That is correct Chair.    I signed it on the 6t h of October 2015.    That is correct Chair and the point that I am making that you will find in Eskom is that at that point when I came back Group Commercial and Technology was in transition of being split but I was in the office so I carried the office but the commercial part of the Group Technology was in Commercial – was in the CFO.  The sort – the cutting happened effectively on the 23 rd of October 2015.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No.    Yes.    No Chair.  Edwin Mabelane was an acting in myposition.    When I was on suspension.  That is when the re – if you look – if you read Mr Mabelane’s affidavit he deals with this topic I think quite nicely.  That in my absence a restructuring of the commercial division started and the    Correct.  No, no I am saying you asked about Mr Mabelane I said Mr Mabelane was acting when I was onleave.    When I was in September 2015 Chair or not even in September 2015 – in June in July 20t h 2015 the restructuring commenced and the commercial people even though they were in my box they were officially reporting to the CFO and that process of restructuring was finalised and concluded     On the 3r d of October when the – they did notonly report there but they took..    They moved out of my …    Out of my life completely.  Yes.  So – so in – at this point we had a transition period.    That – but the understanding was very clear commercial in the CFO and that happened before I came back from suspension.    They were reporting to me.    Correct.   Correct.    Indeed Sir.    No Chair.  Chair no I did nothing.  I did nothing.  I am giving you a straight answer but I want to follow up.    Ja.  Every time I give you – my counsel gives me a lecture on how to answer he said I must not wastetime.      My counsel tells me answer the Chair and then you can go.  So the answer is no.    Chair the – this document is preceded by an email of the 31s t of August 2015 and it is on page 811.168 – there is two pages.      8.68.  811.168.   And you know Chair my apologies to abuse you but Ms Mothepu says I was – I used the term I was the main negotiator.  That is not the term she used.  I went back.    She used a term I was central.    She was central.    That is the term she used.    Yes.    Yes and I was saying to you she was wrong because if you look at this email on page 168 a person whois central to the negotiations would not write to the negotiating team.  Remember now I am writing to the team that is appointed by the board tender committee.    Right.  So what I am saying to you is the basis of this letter – of this email was because it was up – it was after the meeting of the board of the 22n d of July 2015 where the board says go and put a corporate plan contract to deal with the design to cost.  And the basis of this email was tocheck on the progress that the team is making.  If the team came to me and says it is all systems go I would have not set up a separate contract with fixed rate that is fully compliant with the National Treasury. I would have said to them sign because I have got this urgency.    Once they came with this lot of interventions, I decided I am not getting involved here.  The team has – they have been appointed by the board, they have been given the mandate they must live within the authority.  If they need any intervention, the intervention can only come from the authority that gave them not me – I left them and went to do a separate contract that I signed and initialised on the 29 t h of September 2015 that was eventually signed in 2016 a year later by Mr Mabelane.  So I did nothing Chair.   I gave you direct answers.    I give a direct answer Sir – I did nothing.    Chair I have answered the question.    I confirm I signed that.    I confirm I did that.    I confirm that.    Compliance with National Treasury.    Chair I am very familiar with this document – I know it very well.    I am very familiar with this document.    Ja.    No, no. I do.  Chair it is not surprising at all.   My first day when I came to work I sent an email to Mr Ngubane.    20 July and I told him we need to comply to the cost containment the requirement of National Treasury or we get a – an approval from National Treasury.    Mr Ngubane.    That is the email – one of the emails that he denies that I discussed it with him.    And I also told him that Mr Ngubane once he understood what we need to do he was very clear to MsDaniels, comply or we will get the approval from Mr Treasury.  At all material times, that is what directed me.  Guys, you know the rules.  You comply or you get...  You get national consult... division.  There is...  So I did not have to get(?) anything.  You know the rules, chaps.  You must comply or you must go to Mr Treasury.  Mr Treasury must agree with you but you cannot simply not comply.  And I have no other interventions to do and the board, as a matter of fact and that is what I told Dr Ngubane, the board has no authority to let you carry on without complying.  Ja,look at this.  There is nothing you could have done.  It is as simple as that.       Exactly.     They knew my position.     They knew exactly what ...[intervenes]     ...answer will get for me.     Chair, go to my transcript.  I do not think we should waste your time.  My transcripts are very clear of my discussion with Dr Ngubane.  It was all about National Treasury’s compliance.     Exactly.     It was on this point, exactly.     So we are wasting your time if you put...  The transcript will show this.     No, Chair ...[intervenes]      Chair, I make a proposition to you that of all the emails I have sent to Dr Ngubane, I am happy to deal with them one by one, explain to you why I sent to them.     Sent those emails through to him.  You gave us that opportunity.  I took that opportunity to deal with two of them.  Both of them on that latch(?) the MSA.  And I told you that the reason I sent this Dr Ngubane is because the board was carried away giving the cost constraints at the time to go with the risk approach which started in my time before I was expanded.  And I told Dr Ngubane that you cannot proceed on this line until or and unless you have National Treasury’s approval.  The transcript will deal with that straightforward.    I mean, it is quite simple here, Chair.       Mr Seleka’s assistants are just quick.  They can just go to the transcripts       Chair, when I come on Monday we will deal with this.  It will disappear quickly because I know what I said.     Yes.    I am there, Chair.     [Indistinct] [Speaker is not clear.]     Yes.     No, your recollection ...[intervenes]      Your recollection is not correct.    So ...[intervenes]      No, Chair.       The value of the contract ...[intervenes]      The value of the contract is zero and it has got an upfront payment of R 475 million.That R 475 million, if I recollect, will be deducted out of future invoices.  That R 475 million was not in the original mandate and it was...  If you read the minutes and I hope we will go to it now, now that we are in it.  You will see the meeting clearly says that the R 475 million is rectified because it was not in the original mandate.     Chair, the mandate that was given on the 6 t h of July 2015, this is the mandate that was given and that is why the... had to be rectified.     yes.     Yes.    Yes.  And the minutes say so.     I hope Mr Seleka will take you through the minutes.     The second column.  329 there.  The second column on the right.     McKinsey.     Yes.     [Indistinct] [Speaker unclear]     Yes, this is what it says.     But Chair now that I have answered theanswer yes.     Look at the table.     On the left-hand side ...[intervenes]    It has got a title that says approved mandate objector(?) ...[intervenes]      You will find that on 327.     And on the right-hand side it says results achieved.       The team is doing a wonderful thing there,Chair...  [Speaker unclear]     This is what we came to tell you on the 6 t h of July.  This is what we achieved.       And Chair... [Speaker unclear]     This is what we asked.  This is what we achieved.  Condone or rectify the deviations.  It is up tothe Board Tender Committee to say we do not accept or we accept.  Now that I have answered the answer yes, I am also giving you information that will benefit you.     There is nothing wrong.     I cannot recall, Chair.     I do not know Chair.  The project manager will know.  Chair, I consistently have told you that this Commission has got the wrong person answering these questions but id o not know.  All that I - all that I am happy with and all what I power(?) over(?) is that the team playedopen cards to the decision maker and the decision maker made the decision with the eyes wide open and if the – if the money was paid, it was approved.     Chair, there was ratification.     Because the minutes says so     Mr Seleka must take us to the minutes of the ...[intervenes]      Yes.  It says – it is very clear.  I can tell you.     No, Chair.  Mr Seleka, must take us there.  If I am there, I would know it.     Chair, I have got the minutes on my computer.  So during the break I can take them out and give you.    But I can tell you.      I stand by this submission.     And this submission is complied in all aspects.  And I remember, I cannot tell you how the ratification came about because I was not part of the Negotiating Team.     That I have no knowledge of.     But what I am happy with, however it came about it was transparent to the BTC and the BTC approved it and in the event that it was paid, which I will not know, it was paid lawfully.     21 October 2015.     But even the extracts of the minutes also.     I have read them before.     I also recommended additions to the project.  Chair, that is the affidavit ...[intervenes]    You cannot say you.  Eskom has got 44 000 employees.     Yes.     Yes.  But Chair, Eskom a delegation toauthority.  What does the Group Executive signs for?  It signs for compliance.  It does not sign for...  He cannot be.  So he cannot be.  He is not a specialist.  [Speaker unclear]     So you cannot bring a transaction that is – that has got to do with – let me give you an example of Eskom Treasury where you say because Mr Koko signed therefore he signed for National Treasury.  He cannot.     I think ...[intervenes]     Chairman.     Fortunately, on this transaction ...[intervenes]      I can live with that.     Fortunately ...[intervenes]      On this transaction.       I have no problem with that.    Fortunately, but ...[intervenes]      But your understanding is not right.  Upon this document... ...[intervenes]      Exactly, Chair.    Exactly.     Exactly, Chair.     Exactly, Chair.    So I am saying to you.     The Group Executive Technology and Commercial at that point held the position of the Chief Procurement Officer who is an official at the Board Tender Committee who is accepted to sign every single document that serves before the Board Tender Committee to be compliant with the requirements of the Board Tender Committee.  It is impossible for him to be an expert on everything.       Exactly, Chair.     But all... It is not done that way.     And I do hope in defence of my colleagues that are still there, the documents get revised and written that way.  The 32-10-34 has got a requirement of who signs for what.  So if you go into the 32-10-34 it will tell you ...[intervenes]     ...who signs and why he signs.     So...  But this – I mean, I have signed many of these documents which says there you signed to say everything is correct.  So it is impossible.  So let me give you an example.  I am not a nuclear scientist.  When the nuclear scientist in Eskom goes to the... committee, I must sign to make sure that all the governance processes have been done.     But in any event, Chair.  In this document that is before you ...[intervenes]      ...I am happy to have signed for it.    Yes.     In other words, the gatekeeper to this contract is compliant to National Treasury Regulations.  So.  And this is normal, Chair, the – because it is a bespoke(?) contract, the Board Tender Committee has to agree to it with the necessary conditions.  So this is – I understood exactly what that meant when I signed it.     Correct, Chair. ADV SELEKA     No, Ms Matshepo’s evidence is nonsense, man.       Chair ...[intervenes]      Chair, this is where you have to demand paperwork.  This is where Mr Seleka has to show and tell.  Ms Matshepo’s emails are after this... December.  Ms Matshepo says... after – in November/December and then comes in and says we have added, it is after this Chair, it is not that type of evidence.  If you become pedantic and you just follow paperwork, Ms Mothepu is going to be exposed and she needs to come and explain toyou why she says I have changed and added items when the additions served on her to the board on the 6 October and she refers to the November and December.  And in any event, Chair, in any event, Ms Mothepu, and here is one issue that makes her argument fall.  One of the things that she says I added was master – vendor procurement, which is not part of 4.5.  Vendor procurement is not part of Generation, vendor procurement is not part of [indistinct], vendor procurement is not part of claims management.   So the things that she says I have added, two of them, Duvha insurance and master vending are not part of 4.5.  She was blatantly lying to you.  Now you need to understand, given the documents here because the documents are telling you something different and we willget to other witnesses.  I mean, I received a document, an affidavit from witness 3, that all of a sudden she says I did not know Mr Koko in 2013 but I saw him and recognised him.  Why would somebody who does not know me, saw me seemingly.  The evidence before you, Chair, that you must go, when you sit on your own, making your report, must just look at the documents and the evidence. Duvha insurance, master services, is not part of this 4.5.  That is the evidence before you.     Chair, I am saying to you all the three – and I am glad Mr Seleka and God is with Moses, I always say so, I have got nothing to do with 4.5.     The claims management is Medupi and Kusile, it is building – it is the issue that is on the headline of Maake.  They now raise it is Maake saying - before we finish this, before you finish your report, all your witnesses that are star witnesses will be behind bars soon, butanyway.  The claim management is Group Capital, it is Maake, it is all the claims in Medupi and Kusile, it is purely Kusile and Medupi and Ingula(?).     Chair, I am saying to you what is in the proposal is here.  What is in the proposal I signed off on it on the 6 August 2015.  It served on the board on the 21 October 2015.  There is no vendor management here, there is no Duvha systems here.  There is no rebuilding of Duvha boilers here.  It is things that are added, are tabulated, Chair, you will find them, they are here, they are detailed and they are not added by me, they are added bynegotiating team that negotiated them.     Yes.     Yes.     Can I take this away?     I am there, Chair.     It is the same person, Chair, I can confirm.     Chair, I have no personal knowledge of the discussions Ms Mothepu had with other people.     Yes and, Mr Chair, I do not want to get emotional and get upset, this – where is – if you take thisas a basis, and really it upsets me now, if you take this as a basis of what was presented on the 9 February – and I have a very vague memory of it, it lists the packages.  So if you say Master Services you will see that it cannot fit in where my name is.  It cannot.  And if any witness come and say Mr Koko caused a change or added a topic and that topic is vendor management or insurance, then you come here, but it does not fit here.  It actually fits in finance which is what I have always been saying and you will see – look at Ms Mothepu’s name.  Look at it, Chair, it is undernumber 5, it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Do see that?  My name is not there.  So she could not have negotiated with me on issues that under number 5.  She is not on number 3 which is where I would be.   Any package that you add under Generation will have to be authorised by me.  Any package that gets done under finance, where she is, will have to be financed by others and, Chair, once again, once again, I am begging you to just follow the evidence.  I have told you that I had a very soft spot for her, I liked her, I like how she carried herself, she had difficulty talking to people in Eskom and I would assist her.  If she want to talk to people in Treasury I would pick up the phone and say talk to this young lady.  If she want to talk to people in insurance, I would assist her.  That is the – I actually tried to play a mentoring roleto her but the record speaks for itself, Chair, just focus on the records, forget the gossip.  Do not be like Ms Thuli Madonsela who took the gossip.  The documents are here, let us stay with the documents.     I apologise, Sir, but I am very emotional because I have been through this hundred times.     Chair, which Mr …[intervenes]     I think Mr Seleka is right.     I remember seeing these document from Mr Ndou.     Yes, I think, I think …[intervenes]     I think so, Chair.     Mr Ndou is right.     Prof Lourens, I have seen the document.     Mr Ndou sent them to me.     And there is no confirmation those meetings took place, to discuss those specific topics, Chair.     What is the point?     The Chairman will also look at the transcript that Ms Mothepu says I gave her an Indian man to work with on these topics and this Indian man turns to be my professional assistant who is a black lady.  So the Chairman must also take into account that she lied to you.  And, Chair, you must also take into account that I responded to none of those emails.  I could not respond to any of them because they are not in my scope.     Chair, I cannot even remember receiving those emails.     I cannot remember receiving those emails and even if I received them I would not have acted on thembecause they were outside my competency.     Chair, that is what I am saying to you, I have said it categorically that I have never met Ms Mothepu to discuss the issues that are on those emails.      I have never, I could not.  The best I could do is to refer her to the people that are dealing with those topics.     No, let me tell you a story and let me tell you the fact.     By the 23 r d – all those emails, without fail, are after the 23 October when I was out of that official office.   New person was in that office to deal with whatever comesin that office.  When you are Deputy Chief Justice and you get promoted, the new Deputy Chief Justice comes in to deal with whatever comes into there.     Chair, nobody came to me to say have you had a discussion with Ms Mothepu?  I do not remember getting her emails.  I have never responded to her emails.  The bulk part of my interactions with her was to help her to meet people in Eskom, to introduce her to people, to drinkcoffee with her and other people that were assisting, but I would never deal with insurance, for example.  That insurance claim is finance.     The Group Executive Generation has no competency in insurance.The Group Executive for Generation has no competency in Master Vending.  He may know something to do, but it is not his competency.     Oh, Chair, I have come to accept – I have come to appreciate why people continued to send me emails on the issues that I have dealt with in my previous position as a Group Executive Commercial.  I now have come to peace with that because I had signed the contract, I had signed the contract.  I had signed the corporate plan contract.  So people for whatever reason may have not been – may have not accepted that I am out of the role that enabled me to sign those contracts and they probably thought that I have an influence when I was out.     Yes, Chair, I have …[intervenes]     I have never denied meeting Ms Mothepu.  But if Mr Seleka reads that I have met her to discuss the financial issues that she refers to later is wrong.  I have met Ms Mothepu.  I have enjoyed interacting with her but to say you have met her to discuss the issues that she raised later, Mr Seleka is wrong.     Mr Seleka …[intervenes]    No but read it again, Mr Seleka, read that email again.     No, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Where in that letter does it say she discussed those things with me?  Where in that email does it shediscussed those things with me?     She met …[intervenes]     No, no, no, but Chair, there is nowhere in that email where Ms Mothepu says she discussed those issues with me.  She says she met me last week, she discussed these issues with others.  She did not discuss with me.     So let that be very clear.  She met with me, she discussed these issues with others, not with me because she could not have discussed them with me.    Excellent and elsewhere – elsewhere, even on Twitter, in her book, she has written a book, she said Mr Koko never gave me audience.     Audience on these topics.  She said Mr Wood had to phone her when she was on her sickbed to say go and wait on Mr Koko’s door and when Mr Koko and found me on the door, Mr Koko told me who told you to come here, you are brave.  That is her evidence, that is a fact.  That is her [indistinct].     the answer is no.  The answer is no.  Mr Seleka is not going you a direct answer, the answer is no.     Chair, I am saying to you all the three – and I am glad Mr Seleka and God is with Moses, I always say so, I have got nothing to do with 4.5.     The claims management is Medupi and Kusile,it is building – it is the issue that is on the headline of Maake.

The answer is no Chair, and I know ...[indistinct] the answer is no.  In fact she said to me, her own writing that Mr Koko refused to ...[indistinct] to discuss this thing.    And when I forced myself on him and waited Mr Koko told me you are brave.     Chair there’s no such an email.     I can tell you now there is no such an email.     Bundle?     811?     We read the email.    And is it not convenient that they update it later, not before you.    Is it ...[indistinct]?     Maybe it should show ...[intervenes]      Yes.     No Chair.     Chair you will not find that any update ...[intervenes]     Chair in my language, I don’t if Mr Seleka speaks the same language, but in my language we talk about [speaking in vernacular].     Which don’t stink, I am telling you again ...[intervenes]      I am going to ...[intervenes]      I am going to have to difficulty if I translate it.     What I am saying to you is Chair, and I am saying it again, there is no email where Ms Matshepo says it is discussed with me, there will be no email where I have made updates on any document that Ms Matshepo has put to you.   Let me read to you what Ms Matshepo says.    Excellent, when you probed that did this meeting happen she said no.  She didn’t say she met me at ...[indistinct] she didn’t say so.     She did, she is not doubt she did, let me giveyou, let me read you what she said.   Let me read you what Ms Matshepo says.     I am reading from her book.     No but it is very important Chair because it tells you her mindset.     No, no, no Chair ...[intervenes]    “One December morning I woke up with chronic sinus infections, so bad that I was coughing my blood, by GP booked me off on sick leave and I sent Eric Wood a message explaining how ill I was and that I would not be coming to the office.   He was having none of  it, he told me to drive to Megawatt Park and wait in the executive reception area to ensure Matshela Koko reads our MSA proposal.  I have previously sent ... [listen to this] ... I have previously sent the document to Matshela and unsuccessfully tried to get an appointment with him, so I dragged myself out of bed, showered and drove to Eskom where I waited Matshela’s arrival.  I greeted him and he told me why are you there,young lady you are brave.”    Now she sent, whatever she sent, she writes whatever she writes.     There was no discussion ...[intervenes]      ...of the topics.    And you will not find an email that says as we discussed or as we ...[indistinct]      Does she say she met with me at two or she met with my team at two?     She met with the technical team, she didn’t meet with me.     14[c].     16?     Registrar I do need help.     Chair Mr Seleka has been talking about Kemden and other parts, they are all generation, Rand per ton generation, Rand per ton is the biggest contributor of generation ...[indistinct] cost, it is in the authority of Group Generation, Group Executive Generation, and it was clear cut, black and white so there is no ...[intervenes]      There is on issue there.   Where?       No, so the – before you got into it, it talks about Rand per ton, now Rand per ton is a contributor to kilowatt, cents per kilowatt ...[indistinct] generated so  youstart at the top, it says reduce your production costs, what is the biggest single item you need to reduce to meet your production costs it is your coal cost, and how do you that Chair?  It is what we call, and I deal with this elegantly, nicely in my main affidavit.   We talk about spatching on married order, so the most – the cheapest generation units must be available so that you dispatch them first before you dispatch the most expensive generation, and your rand per ton helps, I deal with that nicely in my main affidavit and I even give you a cable of how we reduce a rand perton of coal but increasing the EAF and dispatching the units on merit order.  ...[Indistinct] it is just we want liquidity Chair there, it is clear cut.  The ambiguity is on page 11.23, you see it in a finance light my name should not arise there because this is the CFO’s slide and I don’t remember how the discussion here unfolded or transpired, it would be interesting to see what the minutes says because all what you see in this box it is in the CFO box and only the CFO has the competency to deal with it, nobody else.        Chair I will provide you with the chapter and verse of the board meetings on the Master Agreement.     I did tell you as one of the discussions I had with the Chairman and I did tell you that they wanted to appoint Blue Labels as a Master Vendor by ...[indistinct] I have since acquired the minutes of the board meetings and I will provide them to you and you will see where the truth lies.  It is far away from where ...[indistinct] so by God’sgrace thanks to my name being Moses I have found them, so I will present them to you, I am going to do that.    Secondly the – by the time of this meeting we were all under the impression that there was National Treasury’s approval at this stage.    This is 2015 ...[indistinct]      2016, the 9 t h of February, at this stage ...[intervenes]      It was before the writing was on the wall.    This was before the writing was on the wall.    So remember the letter or the email from National Treasury is dated the 4 t h of February, 4 t h of February 2016, that is the email that I said you look at it and you will make your own judgment on it, this meeting was on the 9 t h.    So I am going to say to you that on this meeting probably the team made a reference to that email communication that we have approval from Treasury.     But how different is that?    No, no Chair.     Because then we have got to address it again because it ...[intervenes]      Then if we have done it then we must do it again, because ...[intervenes]      Ja.     15?     I am there Chair.     No.     Chair you remember this came in, in our last, when we were here and I just didn’t have the time to do that, but let me tell you I have a lot to say about it.     I have a lot to say about it.     And Chair I think we did Mr Barrie?      In our supplementary affidavit we dealt – we didn’t deal with the, yes it is right but we didn’t deal with this through my, but it came afterwards, but we dealt with the Dubai trip in our supplementary affidavit.     Mr Chair I can assure you we deal with this inan affidavit.      We did Chair but we did not have this affidavit is a consequence of the previous discussion.    This ...[intervenes]    We had Ms Alana’s affidavit, that affidavit we dealt with .    And I told you that Ms Alana’s affidavit is defective and I used – I was very polite, but I just told it isa lie under oath and I asked you to – that she cannot get away with that manner, to remedy it the legal team went to procure this one, so this supposed to be a remedy of Ms Alana’s affidavit ...[indistinct].     Correct.    Correct.     Correct.    Correct.    Correct.     Correct.     Can we go to the receipt?     Can we go to the receipt?    Chair thank you. I gave you my covering arrangements when I was here.  First I told you that the affidavit of Ms Alana Lima was a lie – was a lie in all aspects and it was an affidavit that was given to the Hawks in 2018 and now I understand why nothing has come out of it because lies can only take you this far.So Ms Alana had alleged that they booked a trip for me from Johannesburg to Indonesia to Dubai and back to Johannesburg for the period of the 5t h to the 20t h and Mr Essa paid for it.  That was – that is a lie.Hundred percent of it is a lie.  So now they have come back and they have taken the Alana Lima’s lie and theyhave parked it.  So it is no long applicable and I am glad they have done that they made good progress.  We are going to make excellent progress here today.So I have given you your team my travelling arrangements.  It is in the bundle I think – it is Sundown Travelling it is the one that has got a price of 332 if you can take the Chairman to the page.      Oh ja, ja it is 1565.59    Yes.  1569 – 1565.59    Yes.    Correct.      Right.  And that is a booking for my wife and I and five of my kids.    Five kids.    From Johannesburg to Indonesia on the 23r d of December 2015 and back on the 5t h of January 2016.    Yes.    Chair if you go to the pages.    In fact if you go to 1565.63 you will find the travelling.    1565.63.    And there is – it has got the coveringarrangements for all my members.    Yes.    No, no, no.  These are the travel…    This is Thompsons Travel.    This has nothing to do with Travel Excellence.  I do not know Travel Excellence.    No, no it is Sulliman.    Yes.  Yes Chair I was – when you say her.    I was answering the question of Ms Sulliman.    Ms Sulliman affidavit is false in all aspects.    So we     Ms Sulliman aff…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and the bookings were not done.    By Travel Excellence.    This is Thompsons and it is done by my family.    And while we are on that paid for by my family and Chair I now have a confirmation from Thompsons on the payment and the date the payment was received.    And we have given it to you now.    Yes it is separate.   Chair we have prepared a very nice bundle for you.    And we have sent it to the team unfortunately Mr Seleka was busy the whole so he did not have access to it.    But we have got a – in line to your guidance last time.    We have done it in addition – it is a nice pack.    00   So the documents you will see here are notmarked but they put in.    You have got the same documents.    That are properly marked in that way.    You have to see them Chair otherwise we are not – we will not make progress if you do not see them.    I told you that we are going to work from the documents today and we are going to take away the gossip.    You have to read the emails from the bottom.   Yes Chair but what they say is that we have made a booking.    And we have paid for it.    And they confirm that.    My family paid for that.    Now – but what is also 00   It is part of the bundle I gave you.    No, no.    It is the one from Tato.    It is the last one – it is the very last page.    Very – single page – it is a single page like this.     And it comes from Tato.    To Terry..    Kuzakona.  Tato is my daughter.    And you will see    So all.    14 December. What is – what this tells you for me – we were going to Indonesia.  My family had plans to go to Dubai.  They planned for it. We paid for it. The difficulty that we had Chair is that my daughters had problem and you will see it is three names it is Piha, it is Masema, it is me which are the names that comes on the Salim Essa emails. So there was no – we planned for it.  We paid with our money but we had difficulty with passports.  So we could not – my daughter’s – my daughter could not get passports. So I went to Ms Daniels because between Ms Daniels and my professional assistant they never battled with visas – things happens quickly.  I gave all the documents we have to Ms Daniels. I says we have booked our trip to Dubai.  We have paid for it.  It is paid for.  I do not need anybody – I do not need Salim Essa to pay for it.   There is the evidence that we  paid for it.  I know – and – they were good in organising. Please see if you can sort out the visas for us.  And if you    I had no clue at all.  But secondly I did not expect to pay because the evidence I have showed you we have paid for it.  But I never got any refund that somebody ever paid for us.  That is how far I can take the story.   But Chair but here is a 00   It is under the trip.    It is – it deals with the payment Chair.    It deals with who paid.    Chair I see you have stopped sanitising documents.  We – I  the Minister of Health says we are entering the third wave.  Chair Ms Suleiman says she was called on the 20 t h by either Mr Essa or the secretary thatsomebody will dropping the cash on the 20t h and she – and somebody dropped the cash in the house. That somebody is a person by the name of – I will tell you – Shaheed.    That person his name is Shaheed.    Yes.    Now if you go to the last page of the document from Shannon Little it is an email communication between MsSulliman and Salim Essa.  Again you read it from the bottom.    Yes it is the email.    It is an email conversation, “just thanking you at all times Sameera Suleiman.” It is Sameera Suleiman.    Yes second previous page yes.    Ja you read from the bottom up.    It is an email from Salim Essa on the – no, no.  It starts from the bottom.  So the bottom – it is an email from Sameera Excellence – Travel Excellence on the 18t h of January 2016 at 20 past – 18 minutes past 9. “Salam Saliem please see your bookings below.”    Sameera    Yes.    Salim Essa.    Yes.    Yes.  She says   And she gives the bookings of Mr Essa and this tells – these are the bookings of Mr Essa and Mr Essa’s kidand the wife.    And Salim – and the next email is from Salim Essa – salimessa@gmail.com the affidavit of Ms Sulliman says that is the email that she communicated with Salim Essa on.    It is 8 – it is Monday 18 January 2016 twenty past eleven from Sameera Sulliman.   “RE please see below Mr Salim Essa   The next email comes from Salim Essa – from a Blackberry Ms Salim is Ms Sameera Sulliman sends an email    And this is the R100 000.00 that Ms Sulliman received in his house.   That was brought by Shahied that she says it is mine.    And she has kept these emails communications from you.  So – so…    Ms Salim – Mr Salim – and we received these emails – this communications from lawyers of records of Salim Essa on the 24 t h – on the 24t h of March. At that pointwe only had the affidavit of Ms Alana.  We only received the email of Ms Sulliman on the 25 t h.     Attorneys.    Yes.    Yes.    I wish so too because he can – he can break all this.    Chair it is my wish that he comes here.    He will – he will – this commission needs him here.    Ja I do not have contact him Sir.    I actually went into the SIU documents search for the…    And hence give it here.  But Chair the point is – the point I am making to you is Chair.    The point I am making Chair is this is relevant towho paid for Mr Koko.    Mr Salim Essa says I brought the R100 000.00.  I know the R100 000.00 you are talking about.    It was brought by Shahied.    Here is the email communications then that tells you what this R100 000.00 is for.    It was not for Mr Koko.    But Chair if you go to – if you go to page 1565.58.  If you are there.    Bundle 18 1565.58.    Yes Point 58.    Yes. And you will realise Chair I do not buy the story of mistakes you know.  I have come to the point where people are allowed – everybody else is allowed when he lies to represent a mistake – well I do not – when it is Mr Koko it impacts on his credibility.    So     So – so Ms Sulliman says   The cash was – just – in the house and she took it to the bank.    No she took it.    Yes.    Either this is fraudulent or she is lying.  Thiscannot both be correct.  Either she – in fact Chair we will get into the detail.  This is either fraud or she is lying.  But Chair there is another important part. Me and my counsel spent nights looking at the receipt number.  That receipt number 50 or 595TE what do you read there?    If you – we have asked for original of this.  It reads - if you look at closely within this 595.     And you can start with, like, if 595 is 1040.    Is 1040.     And that is why we have asked for it.     But in any event.  Ms Halima who lied to you in an affidavit before.     Who lied to the Hawks before.  The Hawks     I think I know what happened there, Chair.     I think I know what happened there.     Yes, Chair.     I have gone through this evidence and this is where tried and really tried to help you.  It is a fact that my travel arrangements or my changing(?) arrangements fromIndonesia to Dubai was done by Travel Excellence.  The documents say so.  I am not a type of guy who... a document, unlike many.  The documents, if you look – the flight number that is there, is the flight number that I used.  So I have no doubt ...[intervenes]    I have no doubt.     Look, Chair, when – and this is what I keep on asking you.  When documents speaks for itself.  You really look stupid to...  I mean, I have seen many people... look stupid because the every – the document say so when you try ...[intervenes] [Speaker unclear]     ...take people for a ride.  The document sayso.     So.  And that is not a debate.  You have got limited time and I do not want to spend time.     So that is... [Speaker unclear]     From Indonesia to Dubai was done by Travel Excellence.     They lied before and I do not know why they lied that they booked my... plan.  [Speaker unclear]     Because they were lying.  They did not think that I would have the documents.  I will find the documents to show that they were lying but...  [Speaker unclear]  But now they have... [Speaker unclear]  Now when I – when my daughter battled with a visa and I asked Ms Daniels.  My proposition is simple.  And that is why I spend a lot of time, trying to show you the proximity between Suzanne and Mr Essa.  That is why I – I even now I have printed emails to show you that these people know each other.  Ms Daniels in his – in her disciplinary hearing says he has been communicating with Mr Essa since March – since April15.  You got – again, if you do not have it.  I only – your legal team, I will go and show it to you.  They know each other, these people.  It is no coincidence that Ms Essa offered him – offered her R 800 million bribe.  It is no coincidence that you would wake up on a Saturday morning and go to meet people in Dubai with pyjamas, wearing pyjamas.  They know each other  I think, instead of her going to where I sent her because I gave her the documents – I gave(?) her where togo.  She went to her friends.  She went to her friends.  Now you keep on saying to me.  Why is Salim following you?  Salim is not following me.  Ms Daniels went to her friends.  I had no reason, Chair, to get anybody paying for me.  I have given you confirmation that I will pay R 383 000,00.  I have given you documents to show you that as early as December 2014, we have – my family planned go via Dubai.  We just could not – had a problem with the visas which Ms Daniels sorted for us.  I do not know he(sic) sorted of us.  But clearly, clearly he(sic) solved it brought his(sic) friends in.     Yes.    And I gave her the documents.     I gave her man to deal with.     Chair, I – Suzanne used to – Suzanne introduced herself in Parliament as the Chief of Staff in my office.  That is how she introduced...       So that tells you what a type of relationship I had.  A professional one.  We are not friends.  But we are professionals that I can ask her such things.  Granted, at that point, I asked her.  It was December 2015.  She had already moved to the Chairman’s office but we still kept the relationship.     We still kept the relationship.     No, I do not.     No, no, no.       I do not – I do not have ...[intervenes]      But these are – the travel arrangements, I think that between her and my professional assistance, there would – I would just get my to my office and pick up my travelling documents and I will go.  Between them, they were very efficient.     To Dubai.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, and here I am saying her associate which concerning Salim Essa.    Because the thing with Salim Essa is there.      I mean, you all – we had to go through Salim Essa.  [Speaker unclear]     Remember when I told you – I dealt with this topic before, when we get into the visas.  I said to you but this email address is an email address that you gave to me that I must use it when I want to talk to the Chair but is the same email address that brings me a visa.  And by the way, I have since changed my mind.  I think she – Ms Daniels had – that was a portal that Ms Daniels had access to.  Given the evidence, that is what it is.  And she answer she gave me was convenience.  And I said to you then the mistake I did not do, I did then, was not to probe this convenience thing.       No, I think she – I think she approached Travel Excellence through Salim Essa.     Chair, this is interesting conversation.  Long, long.    Not soon.     No.     2018.     Yes.     Dr Bonn(?) was even gone.     Because Eskom went into – and this is the point.  So I was so transparent with these emails that I – on my phone used my Eskom email address.  You know, itis not a characteristic of a person trying to hide.  So I used my email address, Eskom email address to sent the emails to the receptionist to claim(?) the visas.  And then it died     By that time we were no longer on speakingterms, Chair.       She was calling out, telling everybody that I stole money from Eskom.       Or his secretary.     Yes.  And the visas, yes.     No, the documents say so... ...[intervenes]      You cannot argue that.     Correct.    Ja.     Yes.     Yes, I ...[intervenes]      Yes.     I ...[intervenes]     That part ...[intervenes]      It is not a problem for me.       I accept. 
MATSHELA MOSES KOKO:  [duly sworn, states] 
COUNSEL FOR MR KOKO:   Chair I have not quite heard what the page number is?
KOKO:That’s I think either towards Eskom Parliamentary file, it was part of the bundle that MsDaniels put together, that’s when I came to be aware of this, but Chair we are playing around in circles, the writing was on the wall, there was no National Treasury compliance at that, at least around February/March and when the letter of award of 17 December 2015 was signed and when the date of the 7 t h of January is referred to.  They were reporting to me before my suspension. 
ADV BARRIE SC:   Chair may I say something?     This issue relates to the validity of the MS.    And the reason that it was regular related to provision of public law and that is the irregularity and the law on that is with respect very clear is that until it is set aside that administrative act which in this case was in conclusion of the contract remains valid and the court may set it aside and then of course things are what would be equitable under the circumstances or even although it was irregular and hence unlawful but until the – it reaches that stage it cannot simply be regarded as a nullity and thatsimply arises from the presumption in administrative law of regularity is it needs to be set aside so it is actually quite a number of complex issues of law that arises in this particular context in the enrichments sphere as well.     But I just wanted to make that point,.     Chairman, may I …[intervenes]     The updated version of the bundle 16 has not been sent to us, so we do not have these documents.  I did not want to interrupt but they can even be sent to us electronically or emailed to use right now, that is fine, but our bundle stops at page 792 and that was at the end of March, so we were not given access to the updated bundle.  It can just be sent to us even as we sit here.     Chairman, may I …[intervenes]     The updated version of the bundle 16 has not been sent to us, so we do not have these documents.  I did not want to interrupt but they can even be sent to us electronically or emailed to use right now, that is fine, but our bundle stops at page 792 and that was at the end of March, so we were not given access to the updated bundle.  It can just be sent to us even as we sit here. 
MR POPO:   No.    No the people that will be here will be thesubordinates of the CFO.     Yes.    And I am not one of them, so I don’t even ...[intervenes]      They are, they are finance people and let me tell you those who normally at Eskom your ...[indistinct]finance is at your biggest risk and I always get the right people to support me, no Chair I had nothing to do with that, I had nothing to do with it. 
BARRIE:Chair, something that we know...[Speaker ’s microphone not working properly] ...but we have filed a new bundle, a further bundle today.  It was sent to the team which we asked to be added to Bundle 50. 
ADV BARRIE:   And we hope that will be made available to you by Monday.     Our problem is.  This is Mr Koko’s – I think it his eight day here and it is a very – it is in a sense wide-ranging.  In another sense, they are actually very – theissues are actually simple.But the way that the examination has gone in relation to each and every point because every time Mr Koko comes to testify, then the work stream goes and they find witnesses who contradict him and then he comes back and that is put to him and then – and it is an endless process.  And then we need to deal with that in some way or another and I am not quite sure that it is practically possible to deal with that comprehensively in an affidavit.  What I would propose is that, yes, we will do a – do something to that effect but it might still be necessary to hear Mr Koko.     Something to elucidate in some instances but I am sure that it will cut the proceedings ...[intervenes]     ...considerable but we need a bit of time.  I just need a bit of breathing space.  [laughs]     But yes ...[intervenes]      ...we have actually considered that because we know that you have these time constraints.
