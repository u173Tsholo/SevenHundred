CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius.  Good morning everybody.     Yes.  They like giving me your opening address.     [laughs] I do not need it.  These are for Monday.  Okay.  Yes.  Are you ready?     Good morning, Ms K.     The oath that you took the other day ...[intervenes]      The took that you took the other day continues to apply, okay.     Yes, okay alright.       I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Just so that people who are listening will understand.  Would it be accurate if we say whenever in relation to Ms K’s evidence and Mr Y’s affidavit, reference is made to a name without surname.  Everyone must understand that is a secret name.     Yes.  Okay.  When it comes up for the first time, you mean that.     Okay, that is fine.  Okay alright.     Yes.     Ja, that is alright.     Okay, alright.  Ms K, you say that it is the expenditure that grew from R42 million in the 16/2017 financial year to approximately R303 million in the 2017/2018 financial year.  So your only correction is that it is not the budget, it is the expenditure but in terms of figures and the years, everything that is there, you agree with it.     Okay.     Yes, yes?  Yes, Ms K?     You did not hear the whole question?     Oh, okay, not that is fine.  Okay.     Now I am sorry, I thought she was saying the opposite.  Let me have a look.  Is that 7.6?  What paragraph?     Third sentence?     Yes, just state, Ms K, what that word should read.     Oh.     Okay, is that something you can explain without any harm to State Security Agency, contact expenditure or explaining it might not be appropriate?     If you are not sure, you must just …[intervenes]     Yes, I am saying if you are not sure explaining it would be appropriate or not then do not explain it but if you are sure that there is no problem then you could explain to me what it means, contact expenditure.     Okay, alright.     Okay, but it is meant to be contact expenditure and not contract expenditure.     Okay.     Sorry, Mr Pretorius. Ms K, I do not know if I missed this when you gave evidence earlier but because of your correction of the second sentence of Mr Y’s paragraph 7.6 it looks like there ought to be – you should be wanting a correction also in regard to the first     You cannot hear me?     Okay, alright, I think I am looking down.  So I am saying you said that Mr Y’s second sentence of paragraph 7.6 is incorrect insofar as it says it was the budget for the office of the DG that increased from approximately R42 million in the 2016/2017 financial year to approximately R303 million in the 2017/2018 financial year.  Do you remember saying that?       You said it was the expenditure that grew.     Not the budget.     So the sentence that precedes that     In the second sentence?     You see, the first sentence does not have the word budget but it has budgetary allocations.   The second sentence which you corrected earlier on has got budget.     As I understand it, what Mr Y was saying is when you look at the operational activities run from the office of the DG, you could see an expansion and that expansion was reflected in the budgetary allocations.  That suggests that he is saying if you went to the budget you would find that larger amounts were allocated for various     Okay.  I think then just to …[intervenes]     Ja, just hang on, I think just to absolutely sure that you know what you mean, I think you need to say what – how the first sentence should read, as far as you are concerned, and the how the second sentence should read and then we are done with that point.     Okay, thank you.  Thank you, Mr Pretorius?     Ja.  We will take the tea adjournment until half past.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS     Let us proceed.   If you may proceed Mr Pretorius.     I do not know what that is.     Okay alright, proceed.     Yes, I have got it.      Yes, Counsel. ADV PRETORIUS     I am sorry.  Looks like Counsel has got something to say.  UNKNOWN     Mr Pretorius?      Yes.     Yes. ADV PRETORIUS     Well I certainly remember that Mufamadi dealt with some of the matters that are being dealt with.     Ja.     Ja.     Mr Pretorius I am just confirming that he understands.     Yes, okay thank you.  Yes, you may proceed, Mr Pretorius.      Yes, Chair.      I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Did you say Ms K, that SSA operative or maybe I should not say operative, SSA…[intervene]     Oh you cannot hear me, again.     Can you hear me?     Yes, I do not know why it seems to give problems.  Did you say that as far as you know it would be legitimate for SSA people, I am saying people you might be able to categorise them, to be…[intervene]     You cannot hear me.     I think the technicians must attend to this because we have had video links, witnesses giving evidence via video links and it would not happen that the Chairperson is the only one that the witness struggles to hear.      Yes. Let me try again, Ms K and there you must tell me if you cannot hear.      Did you say it would be legitimate or there would be nothing wrong with let us say, SSA operatives maybe you can put another category of SSA people in the place of operatives, or in addition to operatives, to be for example at the conference of a political party, or to be in the vicinity of the conference of a political party where there are presence there is connected with the political conference of that political party?     So there could be a legitimate role to play. But whether or not on a particular occasion, they played a legitimate role, obviously would depend on what they were doing and so on.  But you say, you are saying there could be a legitimate role for them to play.     Do you know, from your experience whether something like that happens with the conferences of other political parties, the DA, the UDM, the EFF?     Well within the DA there could be a Premier.     No, no that is fine.  If you do not know, part of the reason why I am asking is, as you know is that I am hearing evidence and I heard evidence to the effect that the CDSO all or SSA, or certain units of it were interfering or seemed to have had interest in factions within the ANC. So when you hear that when the ANC conference at Nasrec Base SSA people were in the vicinity, you wonder whether they were there for a legitimate reason and if they went there, not because it was an ANC conference, but simply because it was an event.   Then the question arises, do they show the same interest when it is a DA conference, a UDM conference and EFF conference.  So you have heard about them doing this in relation to an ANC conference, but you have not heard about them doing this in regard to another political, other political parties, but you do not say that it did not happen with other political parties.  You simply say, you have no knowledge.  Is that correct?      Okay, alright Mr Pretorius.     Did you say page 56?     Hang on one second Ms K.  Mr Pretorius, just tell her if there are other names that she should not mention in the document.     But you have been [laughs] overriding them, is it not?     Yes.     Ja.     So ...[intervenes]  ADV PRETORIUS     You want to say she must not mention any names of a person or name of entity or company.     Obviously, she can mention CDSO, I guess.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes, okay.  So I guess what that means Ms K is that you do not mention the name of the company appearing on the first line of Clause 2.1 as well as the name of the company that appears on the second part of Clause 2.1.       Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, until you know what the position is.  As I understand it, you say that she should not mention – well, in that page there seems to be – those two seems to be the only names of companies.     If she moves to another page of the same document, I guess what you have just said would apply as well, namely she should avoid mentioning the names of companies that are there.     Okay.  Ms K, you were saying something about Clause 2.1 when we interrupted you.     I am sorry.  You are reading from where?  I thought you were at 2.1?     Oh, okay alright.     Ja, I can see it now where you are.     Ja.       So I guess Ms K, there are a number of points that arise from this evidence.  It is one of them that private companies were paid money from SSA to do SSA work that SSA had personnel who were supposed to do that work?  Is that one of the points that you are making?     So you – SSA has got personnel who are supposed to do this work.  They are paid so that they can do this work but money is taken out to pay private companies to do that work.  So there is duplication quite apart from the question whether or not it was legal to do that.     Yes.     Yes.  Okay, thank you.  Mr Pretorius?     Ja.     Yes.     Ja, fake documents and so on.  That is what you said, hey?     Ja.     Perhaps repeat the page?     864.       Just to say Helen being a pseudo name.     Yes.     Well, I do not know what the exchange rate was, the Euro and rand or the currency in June 2017 but that particular acknowledge of receipt at page 864 reflects that over 2 million Euros were given to the person who signed there and there is no name on the receipt but my rough estimate is that of – last time I knew, and that might be a long time, R8 would amount to 1 Euro, so that might be over 16 million.     Oh, you see, it is a long time I last checked.     But R30 million in June 2017.     And now it would be R40 million, about, more or less.     Ja.     Fair estimate.     Yes, it is a lot of money.  Okay.     Yes, let us take the lunch adjournment.  It is five past one, we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS     Okay let us continue.     [laughs] Well, I think it is fine.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Well, you did not mean to say you do not know, did you?     Okay.  Ja, that is fine.  Okay.     Yes?     Yes okay.     Thank you.     Okay, thank you very much Ms K for availing yourself to come and assist the Commission, particularly in the light of the unexpected unavailability of Mr Y, but I understand that you either will or maybe come back to the Commission in regard to other evidence that I will be told once if you will come back, but from what Mr Pretorius said it looks like at least there may be a possibility of you coming back to deal with other matters. Thank you very much for making yourself available.     Yes.     I think somebody is sabotaging the Chair today.   No I was saying Ms K from what Mr Pretorius has said I understand that there is a possibility that you may come back to deal with other matters of which you have personal knowledge but whether that will  happen or that will not happen I will be told in due course, but thank you very much for making yourself available.  I will now excuse you.     Thank you.   Mr Pretorius?     I am sorry Mr Pretorius, are you still there Ms K?  She has gone, okay.     Oh, no I just want to emphasize the Commission’s appreciation of your making yourself available in the circumstances in which you made yourself available.  We appreciate it very much.     No, thank you very much Ms K, we really appreciate what you have said.  Thank you.     You were saying something and then I interrupted you Mr Pretorius.     I think about another witness.     Okay no that is fine.   So we will try and find space even if we use evening sessions.     To try and complete or hear the evidence of those who we have not heard as yet.  Thank you very much.  We are going to adjourn for the day, for the benefit of the public next week the Commission will hear evidence relating to Parliamentary oversights. We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good morning Chair.     [microphone muted]     Yes, I am Chair.  Ms K, can you hear us.  Good morning.     Good morning, Ms K.     You confirmed your knowledge of the second – the contents of the second sentence in paragraph 6.5.7 to the effect that Frank had explained in his interview with the Investigation Team that the initial plan, Project Wave, holds not resembles to the activities later carried out under Project Wave which related to the media.  Do you confirm that?     Then the next sentence reads    It appears ...[intervenes]      Yes.  It has been our practise thus far Chair to state explicitly when a name is given and I will continue this practise.  I did not in this case but we did yesterday.     Yes, but I will do it anytime.  No problem Chair.     Ms K in relation to the second sentence in that paragraph.  Does that mean – and I am just asking you to clarify what is said there – that the documents which would have established the project and the motivation for the release of funds would not accurately would have reflected what was ultimately done under the rubric of Project Wave?     The initial plan referred to in the second sentence.     You said here to have borne no resembles to the activities later carried out under Project Wave which related to the media.  In other words, the original plan which would have been included in documentation motivating the establishment of the project and motivating the release of funds for the project bore no resembles to what was actually conducted under the rubric of the project.  Is that what that sentence means?     Thank you.  Paragraph 6.5.8 reads    It is a ...[intervenes]      Yes, perhaps received – a report in the possession of the Investigation Team.     Right.     Was that found in the safe that you spoke of earlier?     Right.  Now the implication, of course, of that statement, and correct me if I am wrong, is the intelligence agencies of the SASS, was dealing with senior cabinet members and various senior leaders in the ruling African National Congress on the basis that they were colluding and in a conspiracy to effect regime change in South Africa.   Does that imply that the object of the project, at least there, would have been to protect the existing regime against change?     Yes, I think it is fairly obvious but thank you for that.  Under challenges it is reported inter-    Yes, of course.       It is Annexure W9 and it is at page 656.     Of annexure - of Bundle SSA-1.     And if you would go to page 658 after looking at the cover page, you will see in paragraph 4.2.     Sub-paragraph A.     Have you found it?     And in sub-paragraph B what is quoted in the statement of Mr Y appears in the report, the written report at paragraph 4.2(a) and (b).  Do you see that?     Yes.  One of the observations one can make from that extract from the report is that possible sources within the media were in some cases at least too expensive for the operatives that were recruited.  And the other is that media houses or certain media houses refused to cooperative. Is that how you understand those allegations or those statements?     Right.  Paragraph 6.5.9 reads    Alright.  And those records are also contained in the SSA bundle.  They include two invoices for R 10 million, each raised by Apricot or African News Agencies and proof of payment via EFT on 25 January 2017.     Are you able to confirm the invoices and the payment as having coming to the ...[intervenes]      ...look at the invoice because they referred to here and annexed.  So if you have any comment to make on the invoice which is part of Mr Y’s statement as an annexure, you are free to comment on that.     Yes, if it is a signature of an operative, please do not mention it.  If it is a signature of an official, you may mention it because it is before the Chair.     Alright.     624.  Yes.  The documentation you are referring to is at page 621 and following.     Yes.  That evidence has largely been given but thank you for confirming those details.     Paragraph...  I am sorry if there is anything you wish to add?     Okay.  Paragraph 6.6.0 reads    Alright.  That, I am not sure whether in respect of that information it has been declassified for our purposes.     And we would not have issued notices, at least to my knowledge.  So we cannot go there for the moment but we may put that information in your supplementary statement if we may.     Alright.  I understand what you are saying to be that even though the demands made by personnel and the media might have been high, you know that attempts were made, successfully in some cases to meet those demands.  Is that what you are saying?     Right.       It is fair to point to one document that does not mention any names or implicate any individual either generically or individually but there is evidence in the bundle that individuals within the media received money as part of Project Wave.     That evidence in its detail I would prefer to consider and place before the Chair at a later stage once we considered its import and what we need to do to follow the rules.  If that is in order Chair?  We have a number of positions that received monies in the media but we just have to consider whether giving that money would identify the person.  And if it identifies the person, we need to issue notices.       Thank you for that input Ms K.  It seems that despite the volume of evidence given by you and other witnesses, the Commission at least and it appears that the Investigation Team at least has not yet established the full scope and detail of the CDSO Project in the period under review.  Would that be a fair comment?     So for example.  The investigators have information of at least nine other projects.  And I say at least nine other projects, Project Speed, Project Beetle, Project Amex, Project Armani, Project Fruit, Project Denaido(?), Project Iso Toxil(?), Project Worcester(?), Project Skyline.     Alright.  So there appears to be monies paid out, including monies in the form of cash, in respect of these projects but you have no further information?  Is that what I understand the position to be?     Thank you.  Well, we now get to another category of projects and that is operations within the office of the Director-General.  If we can move to that section, please?     Paragraph 7.1 reads    Alright.  The paragraph continues.  This is reflected in the notable increase in operational expenditure in the office of the DG which was mainly attributed to these covert projects.  Are you able to confirm that?     Yes, and we will come back to that     Yes.     Okay.  Paragraph 7.3 reads    Alright.  Let us continue in     The paragraph, that is paragraph 7.4 continues ...[intervenes]      Bless you.   “...by way of example a temporary advance for R2 million was requested by Helen under Project Mayibuye and approved by Mr Fraser as latest September 2017.” That document is also contained in the records.       For the record, it appears at page 549 of SSA-1.  If you need to go there, we can.  But do you know of that fact or alleged fact?     You know that?     Alright.   “Helen pseudonym TA’s record reflect that approximately R 242 million was taken or paid by her in the period from February 2014 to March 18 allegedly for operations that were run from the office of the DG.  The electronic TA records reflecting the aforementioned withdrawals are contained in a schedule and filed in two of the SSA bundle and is marked Annexure RH-1.” That is at page 859 of the SSA Bundle.     Would these withdrawals have been cash withdrawals?     Would these withdrawals or payments have been cash withdrawals?     R242 million cash?     Yes alright, but – I will not     Right.  The paragraph continues    Alright, thank you.  Then we go to     Thank you.  Subject to that clarification and correction the information I take it you confirm is correct?     If you will just bear with me a moment please?  Chair, if you would just bear with me for a moment, I need to follow something up.     The paragraph continues, it reads    Yes, I am, sorry.     Yes, we were silent for a while.     The paragraph continues    So that is a typographical error, contract expenditure, it is contacts expenditure, is that correct?.     Right, thank you for that, yes.     Paragraph 7.6.     Third sentence.     Third sentence, yes.  The word – am I correct in understanding – well, perhaps you should say what correction should be made.     The paragraph continues    Paragraph 7.7 reads    Oh, was that information referred to there accessible to the investigation team, the Veza investigation team?     The documents relating to the projects run out of the office of the DG, were those available to your investigation or were they otherwise accessible to your investigation?     Right.      The last sentence …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.  The paragraph     Thank you.  Paragraph 7.7 reads    Right. “It is a gross dereliction of duty…” The paragraph continues. “…for the DG to completely disregard the very policies, prescripts and directives that he is responsible for enforcing as the accounting officer and head of department.” Do you confirm that and there is one question I have in relation to that statement before you confirm it and that is, the lodging of documents and the channelling of purported intelligence products as you have described or as Mr Y described in the first sentence and as confirmed by you, are those contained in the regulatory prescripts governing the SSA?     So I understand you to qualify it by saying according to the information at your disposal, that is at least a preliminary conclusion that you draw.     Then paragraph 7.8 reads    Right.       Right, particularly with the next paragraph, we will get there soon.  The last sentence     Alright.  Paragraph 7.9, which follows, reads – and we will deal with that now and after the short adjournment. “Notwithstanding the general lack of documentary records during this period, some of these ongoing operational activities are reflected in a performance review dated 24 February 2017 which was submitted to Mr Fraser by one of the CDSO co-worker deployment team.” That is the [indistinct] 23.32 report which is dealt with both in the high level review panel report presented and in the evidence of Mr Jafta and we can go to it in a moment or after the short adjournment, but did the investigation team receive that or have access to that report?     You cannot obviously speak for Mr Y, can you?  Do you know whether her received it?     Right.     Yes.     Yes.  Because that report is already a matter of record, I would like to place it before the Chair but can we do that after the short adjournment?     Yes, Ms K the Annexure Q referred to in page A10.9.      It is a sneeze as I understand.     A cough.     The Annexure Q referred to in paragraph 7.9 is in the bundle of documents provided to the Commission, it has been referred to in the evidence by Dr Mufamadi, the contents have been referred to and it has been referred to in the evidence of Mr Jafta.  I understand it did not come directly before the investigation team but for the sake of completeness because we wrapping up the evidence this week at least for the moment, I would like to place it on record and see if you have any comment in relation there to.  There are also a number of parties who although not implicated may be affected who would be concerned by the contents of the whole report there.       No, I am just placing it on the record, you do not have to comment.     At page 241 their Bundle SSA01 there is an operational and performance review section of the whole performance review dated 24 February 2017.  Now I am going to read from the right hand column, there of that. The first…[intervene]     …item reads    Chair, this is a Commission of inquiry it may receive evidence at all levels of proof.  Perhaps my learned friend did not understand, I am not asking this witness to comment on the report at all.  She has made her position clear, I asked for leave to place it on the record.      The reason for placing it on record this week is so that interested parties can examine the evidence and deal with it.  The evidence has been placed before you Chair by at least two witnesses. Dr Mufamadi, high level review panel and Mr Jafta.     Yes, as did Mr Jafta.     So the affidavit has been placed on the record.      I am not leading it through the witness, I am interrupting the witness's evidence to place it on record from the bar and from the documentation given which is perfectly legitimate.  This Commission, as you gave leave to do is entitled to receive evidence of this nature in this form and I asked leave of you to do it before.  So that deals with that issue Chair if we may continue.   Paragraph 7.9.1…[intervene]     Paragraph 7.9.1, then through to paragraph 7.9.4, deal with extracts from that report, which we need not deal with and we can go then to paragraph 7.11, Ms K.     Before I ask you any questions, can you have a look at paragraph 7.11 and tell me whether you can comment in relation to those allegations?     Well, sorry to interrupt you, Ms K.  If you are going to comment on 7.11 then let us put it on record and then you can comment, if we may.      7.11 reads    Thank you, Ms K.  What follows from…[intervene]     Yes, Chair it may be important because what follows are the conclusions of the general nature in relation to which you may wish to ask questions to the witness.    Thank you.  In paragraph 7.11, Ms K the statement is made that during this period that is December 2017 and I presume it refers to the time the conference was being held.   “The office manager in the office of the DG, Helen withdrew R19million from the SSA on 15 December 17.”    Right and that R19million is referred to again in a handwritten document contained in SSA01 at page 887, it is the last page in the document.  Do go there, please.    On it - the handwriting on that document was this doc – well firstly, was this document placed before the investigation?    Alright, by the investigation or, and placed before the investigation?    The heading of the notes there is    Yes, you say you are investigating the matter, I presume also on the basis of that document.    Alright and obviously you would know more about the import of that document.  You have qualified it; it says in the bundle it was given to the Commission.  You have explained as much as you can but as said in the last sentence of paragraph 7.11 the matter is the subject of ongoing investigation by the Project Veza team.  Is that correct?    No, I am saying the matters referred to in relation to the R19million at the time of the elective conference in December 2017.  Is that matter the subject of ongoing investigation?     Thank you.  Alright.  Let us then move on to more general topics.  Paragraphs 8.1 to 8.3 are general conclusions drawn in Mr Y’s affidavit from the evidence related to him by earlier and appears to be certain conclusions drawn by the Project Veza Investigation.  I am going to read those three paragraphs to you and you could follow those paragraphs and I am going to ask you in general terms if you have any comment if I may.     Paragraph 8.1 reads    8.2 reads    Alright.  Do you want to say anything about the amount?      Alright.  So that approximation we can leave in the hands of Mr Y?      Alright.  8.3 reads    Then paragraphs 8.4 to 8.9 deals with the principle outsourcing off the SSA’s counterintelligence mandate and give some examples.   The examples are a matter record and because we are pressed for time I am not going to go into detail in respect of the particular examples because without knowledge of what is behind these allegations they are not really informative.  But the examples do show or do you contain statements relating to what appears to be the outsourcing of counterintelligence mandate.  In other words, records of payments to various entities within and out South Africa in substantial amounts.  But let us deal with the principle.      So if there is expenditure in relation to an entity, you say that the prescript requires that should be fully accounted for?      Are you able to say that those prescripts at least were not followed?      Alright.  8.5 reads    Alright.  and what appears in Page – well, in paragraph 8.6 to 8.9 are examples of such payments.  The entities to which payments well mate had all been redacted and very little information therefore emerges from these paragraphs but if you would have a brief look at these paragraphs and if you agree with me - we need not go into that detail but you are free to comment In relation to the details contained here.      So to inform the Chair it is therefore his record and for him to read but in general terms these paragraphs referred to investigations and documentation which record a number of payments to a number of identities both locally and abroad whose names have been redacted.  Is that a fair summary?      Of course.      Alright.  And if you ...[intervenes]      Alright.  Let us do that.      Yes, well let us just attempt to summarise the main points in your evidence and you can assist me here Ms K.  Firstly, as a matter of principle in terms of the governing prescripts, the activities of the SSA are at least alleged by Mr Y not to be lawfully capable of outsourcing.  You have commented on that, right?     The second point is that a number of contracts were entered into by the SSA represented by Ambassador Dlomo around or during and around December 2014 before the projects relevant to those contracts were approved and established.  Is that correct?     A month before.       Thirdly, the proper procedures were not followed and in some cases there were not proper authorisation for the conclusion of these contracts or their later extension.     The total of the amounts involved, at least I paragraphs 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9.  I have just done a quick calculation.  Approximate to R 125 million.  Is that fair?  If you look at the totals in 8.7, 8.8.  It is a rough ...[intervenes]      You do not have to rely on my math but...     Well, then you have pity on me Ms K.     It is well over R 100 million.     Right.  And the – you say the form of the contracts and the contracts themselves do not, in your view, comply with the regulatory prescripts.  Is that correct?     Okay.     If you could look at paragraphs 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9 and suggest to me what we can put before the Chair by way of an example unless you think it is useful to go through all of them.     That is Christian name or pseudonym Napa.       ...para 8.8.  Is that the paragraph you are referring to?     Alright.  Let us look at that.     If you to go page SSA-01, page 56.     Yes, Chair.  The contract starts at page 57.  The cover page is at page 56, black numbers, SSA-01.       56.  Five, six.     [No audible reply]      You see there the contract exists?     Do not mention ...[intervenes]      Please do not mention the name of the company.  That should have been redacted.     Thank you.     Yes.  Chair, I am comforted by the fact that this bundle as it is with its redaction has been cleared by the legal representatives of the SSA and therefore by the SSA itself.  So we cannot get into any difficulty with the SSA but I am conscience ...[intervenes]      Well, I have been going further than they have gone.     In that sense, I have override them.  And just as a matter of precaution.       It may be that this redaction is not complete because only some of the names have been redacted if you look at the document ...[intervenes]      Yes, please.     Yes, sure.     And I will then take further instructions.     I am not certain at the moment but it just appears that there may be a problem with the extent of the redaction.       Yes, I must stress Chair.  Perhaps not in relation to this company but certainly in relation to some companies.  They – the Investigation Team attempted to trace them and have been unable to confirm their existence.     So that raises a whole range of other possibilities.     That these were simply methods used to siphon funds and that ...[intervenes]      ...the evidence has already been given.      By the acting DDG.  But for the moment, I think it is just safer to ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.     There is an interesting clause that appears on page 62 which appears to be entirely contradictory to what you just read and then we will     ...I will invite you to comment in a moment.  It seems that the matters listed in the clause spoke of work on page 59, are precisely what the SSA is obliged by legislation to do and carefully constructed legislation, regulations and internal provisions.  Is that a fair observation?     And you say several contracts were signed in these terms paying entities substantial amounts of money, well over R 100 million to do the work of the SSA.     So the result is, as you point out, that private entities paid for by taxpayers’ money are operating outside the strict controls of the legislation and regulations to conduct intelligence operations.  Is that a fair summary of the position?     The result of this outsourcing was to pay outside private entities to do intelligence work uncontrolled by the legislative prescripts governing the SSA.       Right.     You mean to steal money?      If you would bear with me a moment, Chair?  Paragraph 7.2 on page 61 deals with communications and says that the company must report or furnish information to the SSA.  Are you aware of the person to whom, if this was a legitimate and real arrangement, to whom reports would be made?    Alright.  Let us go on then to paragraph 8.10.      Which now deals with financial     You say yes, is that correct?     It goes on to say    In relation to the risk of theft and fraud, what do you say to that?       Okay.  Paragraph 8.11 reads    And that of course would be one of the problems of outsourcing to people who are not vetted and controlled in the same way as internal operatives within SSA.  Do you agree with that observation?     The statement goes on to say in     The Director General, the Acting Deputy Director General, Mr Jafta, did emphasise the need – and the Chair will obviously consider it, to put in place mechanisms to facilitate the reporting of illegal orders and you have just referred to the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act which enjoins the same conduct to report unlawful conduct.  That is just by way of clarification.     Let us go to paragraph 8.12, if we may?  The statement of Mr Y continues in general terms,     Paragraph 8.13 reads    Yes, so …[intervenes]     I understand.  Is it fair to summarise what your comments entailed by saying that it is no excuse for someone approving a recommendation or recommending a submission by referring to the instruction of the Minister because, as we have learnt, cannot do that, is that correct?     Right.     Point 14, the first sentence needs some explanation but if you could do so without referring to any operational directive, those remain classified. “Financial controls were also weakened by restricting the access of financial officers to operational directives regulating the financial management of operational work.” Now the operational directives are restricted, they have not been declassified, so we cannot refer to their content but operational directives we know from evidence already given that they would control the operations of the SSA and its operatives and management in some detail.  Did the financial officers have access to these operational directives?     I understand.  Thank you.  The     Then paragraph 8.15 reads    Alright, that is noted.     So a particular CFO …[intervenes]     Alright, let us move on to the next section which deals with financial irregularities and the use     Thank you. 8.16.2 reads    8.16.3 reads    8.16.4, you have dealt with the systematic controls over the expenditure of funds and     Right.  Let us go then to paragraph 8.17, the use of cash in operations is said sometimes to be necessary by previous witnesses but it is a matter that requires strict control, also said by previous witnesses, but     The paragraph continues    Yes, it is right at the end, page 864.     864.     Alright, let us just attempt to place on record some idea of this document.  The document is     Is that a sufficient accounting in your view to enable control of cash?     Ja, but perhaps stating the obvious.     Yes, please comment?     Helen is pseudonym, yes.     In the region of R30 million.     Ja, then, yes, at that time.  Now it would be R40 million, at the time.     I am told, Chair.     I am not guaranteeing it is correct.     I think it is a fair estimate, R30 million.     But R40 million in today’s terms, approximately.  Lots of money.     Yes and just one further question quickly.  Do I understand you to say that the example that we have given now is not an exception but is a common – or was a common occurrence at the time?     Chair, would this be a convenient time?     Thank you Chair.  Ms K are you present?     Thank you.  Paragraph 8.18 page 398 of SSA02 do you have it in front of you?     Page 398 of SSA02, paragraph 8.18.     398, paragraph 8.18 of Mr Y’s statement.     It reads    Paragraph continues    Okay.     Alright, so that was a company that held cash and that cash was provided to the SSA.  Do I understand it correctly?     Yes, but Lilly could order that that cash be delivered, is that what that statement is saying?     Right, so that statement is correct is it, as I understand what you are saying?     Paragraph 8.19 reads    Okay, good.  It read…[intervene]     Alright.  Well, let us read the set.  So the first sentence is correct, it applies to more than     In other words, money could be drawn in accordance with the temporary advanced system, even though the prior withdrawal had not been settled.     And advances could be made without proper prior reconciliation.  Do I understand it correctly?     Paragraph 8.2, I read    Paragraph continues to read    And are those statements that I have just read, are they correct?     8.21 reads    You did give evidence previously and I just like to confirm that in the last sentence of paragraph 8.21.  You talk of funds being directed to the office of the DG from the SSA provincial offices.  Do I understand that correctly, funds that should have been allocated to the provincial offices were in fact redirected to the office of the director general, do I understand it correctly?     We know that the Principal Agent Network Program that existed prior to 2011 was apparently terminated and fully investigated.  That evidence has been given, I think by Dr. Mufamadi you recall that?      So in paragraph 8.22, and this is a      “In terms of a further restructuring, effective from 1 April 2017 as part of the strategic development plan vision 35. The Cover Support Unit was established in the office of the DG.” We have also dealt with that.     8.23 reads   Alright, 8.24 reads    I am going to be cautious in the next part of that paragraph.  So if you would be careful not to reveal any names or relationships other than those in red, which are pseudonyms, and I will read it to you as the redacted version will read Chair.  This is something that I have prepared on last night to do in addition to the official     Ja, thank you.  8.25 reads    The next section of the – but you have said the matter is still under investigation, I understand.     The next section deals with parallel and irregular vetting processes. Now there has been substantial evidence given earlier in the Commission's existence to vetting, Mr Jafta gave that evidence.  But the manner in which it is set out here gives some detail and understanding of vetting, why it is necessary to be done properly and how it can be abused.  But I would like you to comment on the next section.  Are you able to comment on the section?     Just stop there in summarise, if we may, I am sorry to interrupt you, you say oh perhaps I should take a step back, 9.3?     Let us just stop there because nine one, two and three are background matters, and I will try and summarise them for the purposes of the record.      9.1 talks of    9.2 reads    9.3    The next section deals with the risks posed by irregular vetting and the statement deals with the abusive vetting structures, which enabled co-workers to be deployed by the CDSO without having been subject to the formal vetting processes of the SSA.  And in order to understand the implications of that  the author of this affidavit deemed it necessary to highlight the risks posed by a regular vetting.  But do you confirm that co-workers were deployed by the CDSO without having been subject to the formal vetting processes of the SSA?     Right, and it is important to understand the next section in the light of the purposes of the proper vetting regime that we spoke about a minute     Sorry?     Thank you, 9.6 reads    9.7 reads    Yes, we will take account of what the acting director general said in that regard and we do deal with weapons and firearms in particular, later in the statement and we can deal with it in more detail there,     Right.  In paragraph 9.9 reads    The danger that is highlighted in paragraph 9.9, as I understand it, is that the existence of an illegitimate and flawed vetting process really undermines the proper process.  That is an obvious comment to make.     And by undermining in the public eye means there may be an unjustified resistance to the proper vetting process.  Is that the point you are making?     Alright.     Thank you.  We move now to the statement insofar as it deals with a parallel vetting     Yes, it is clear.  Well, he can answer that as it is addressed to him.     What did date would you suggest became more accurate in your view?     But we can check that.     Alright.  Paragraph 9.11 reads that    Right.  9.12 reads    9.13 and perhaps this will need     Yes.     Alright.  So when did pseudonym Mandy conduct vetting for CDSO?  Can you establish that from this paragraph?     Right.     Alright.   So ...[intervenes]      It seems to become clear.  But are you saying that even before Mandy arrived to conduct the vetting, there were other vetting processes that had taken place under the jurisdiction of the office of the DG prior to her arrival?  Am I correct?     Alright.  Well, please explain then why ...[intervenes]      Oh, I see.     But when happened in 2018 and 19?  I mean, all you say in 9.13 that she was ...[intervenes]      ...she was in possession of vetting files not that she actually conducted the vetting at that stage.  Is that what you now say?     Alright.  So the statement that it is clear that Mandy had been in possession of vetting files since 2013 should be understood to mean that she had actually been conducting vettings since 2013 not only in possession of files since 2013?  Am I correct?     Right.  The following paragraphs indicates that you examined the vetting files that existed in this parallel vetting structure and you have given that evidence and certain observations were made.  Those are set out in paragraph 9.1.4.  If I can just read through the next six sub-paragraphs. “Approximately 162 files were submitted to the Chief Directorate and Vetting and Security Advising but this is unlikely to be the complete set as additional files had come to the Investigation Team’s attention through other sources.” Is that statement correct?     Second sub-paragraph reads    The third sub-paragraph reads    Fourth sub-paragraph reads    The fifth sub-paragraph reads    Okay.  9.1.5 reads    If you could just have a brief look at 9.15.1 to 9.15.7 and see if you agree with those observations if there were any qualifications, perhaps we should place them on record?     Alright.  And for the purposes of the record.  Each of one of those indicates what appeared to be material procedural lapses in the process of vetting.  That appears summary.     What does it matter if both templates were used?  We need to understand the significance of that if possible.     Alright.  I understand.     Perhaps I should go back to 9.15.7 where we said that those sub-paragraphs with which you agreed highlighted the clause ...[intervenes]      ...in the parallel vetting system.  9.15.7.  I think you have mentioned it in another context but perhaps we should mention it in this context.  The vetting files produced by the parallel vetting system, were they loaded onto the SSA official vetting record system as prescribed by standard operating procedures?     Paragraph 9.16.2 reads    9.16.3 reads    Yes, but the records of this system are deficient and do not comply with the system in place.      9.17 reads    9.18 reads and this is significant because it may illustrate a reason for why this was done in     Correct.     So the next sentence reads    Alright.  9.19 reads    Now there are other statements contained in the witnesses’ statements or affidavits, witnesses who have given evidence this week highlighting Ambassador Dlomo’s curriculum vitae and his past, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal.  Are you aware of those?     Those can be placed on record at a later stage.  It is in a statement Chair.  Do you know whether Ambassador Dlomo’s security clearance was ever subsequently withdrawn?     That again can be dealt with.  The next session deals with the vetting of Mr Arthur Fraser.      9.21 reads    Well, Internal prescripts half as a general rule not been declassified and until I am satisfied that this has been declassified but I am not going to quote from the directive Chair.     So let us move on then two 9.22 if we may.  You do not know, I take it, Ms K whether that internal security directive has been declassified?      Alright.  So let us just go on then to 9.22.  “Mr Fraser's entire vetting process was conducted by the chief Directorate Vetting and Security Advising which was primarily mandated to vet external individuals (that is non-SSA members) in other government departments. this irregular use of the external vetting capacity meant that the SSA officials responsible for Mr Fraser's vetting will members who had been involved in The  namely pseudonym Philani and pseudonym Wendy. As the acting General Manager Vetting and Security Advising, pseudonym Philani had delegated authority to issue clearance certificates for external vetting. It appears that pseudonym Philani and pseudonym Wendy commanded Mr Fraser ’s vetting processes from initiation to completion with little or no regard to vetting prescripts. It should also be noted that both pseudonym Philani and Ambassador Langa who signed the clearance certificate had been vetted by the parallel structure described.” Those statements, can you comment or tell us whether they are correct?     Thank you for that clarification.     Thank you.  923 reads    Right.  9.24 reads    Second subparagraph    The third subparagraph reads    The fourth subparagraph reads    It might be someone else other than Philane?     Right and Wendy we know is also a pseudonym.     The fifth subparagraph reads    The sixth subparagraph reads    Thank you.  The next subparagraph     The next subparagraph reads    And lastly    Thank you.  The conclusion is drawn in paragraph 9.25 – and I am going to read it with certain positions redacted.  Paragraph 9.25, subject to that     The paragraph continues    Are they correct?     Right.  Let us go to the next section which before the conclusions is the last section.  It deals with the illegal use of SSA firearms.  Some of this evidence has been given in summary form by Acting Director General Jafta.  This is a more complete record of these issues.  The first section deals with the regulatory     10.2 reads    10.3 reads    The fourth subparagraph of      “This latter documentation includes official firearm requisition forms, annual firearm inspection and accountability forms for all SSA provincial officers and relevant units as well as firearm an ammunition transport document.” Is that correct?     The fifth subparagraph reads    So it seems by way of summary, Ms K, that the issuing, use and control of firearms is very strictly regulated in terms of legislation and regulations in considerable amount of detail.  Is that a fair summary?       10.6 then reads    Yes, I would have preferred it to     Thank you, I am glad you approved.     My apologies, Ms K, for confusing you.  The next section deals with irregular access to SSA     I will refrain from comment once     Do the prescripts require when drawing firearms from the armoury to state what the purpose of the firearm use would be?     10.9 reads    10.10 reads    And again that would emphasise the need for processes to allow the communication or reporting of the legal orders but that is a comment which     The next section deals with the     10.13 reads    10.14 reads    And is it based on …[intervenes]     Thank you.  10.15 reads    That is correct?     The last section on weapons deals     10.17    So is it fair to say that of those co-workers who were not vetted, who were armed and who have not returned to the SSA may still be out there armed?  Is that a possibility?     Alright.  Okay, we have heard that before but I presume it is not because of reason other than security.     Well, I understand.  10.18 reads    10.19 reads    A remark that could I think validly be made that these sentiments expressed here, and these goals expressed here are precisely the duty of a security agency aimed at the national as opposed to secular interests, is that correct?     And it seems that these very goals were not only not followed but to a degree in this section of the evidence at least undermined.     10.20 reads    Finally in paragraph 11 certain conclusions are drawn by the author of this affidavit, Mr Y, I think it is apposite, we have time to place them on record, there are four sub-paragraphs, with your leave Chair?     Yes, do you have any comment before I go there?     Thank you.  The section on conclusions, if I may put each one to you for our comment and confirmation if you wish, or qualification if you wish,     11.2 reads    And of course we have dealt with the issue of further investigations and what would be required to obtain a complete picture of what was authorised, what was financed and what was finally executed by way of project, and we don’t need to repeat that so if we could go to the final conclusion in 11.4, this is an observation that the investigation team makes that the Chair may or may not take into account, but it is offered I take it in the spirit of what you have come to learn in the      “...[Indistinct] oversight of the intelligence the community ...”     Chair that is the evidence.     Chair we did have one witness lined up who recently and unexpectedly became available.  We had a further witness lined up ...[intervenes]      Noted, and thank you Ms K from the Legal Team and the Investigators.      Yes Chair.     The second witness available will give information of a nature that I need to consider carefully before calling him as a witness so I would ask that we adjourn now.  The further evidence to be given apart from that of the expected General of Intelligence should be able to be condensed within reasonable limits.  It is largely corroborative although there is some new evidence because it has become apparent that there are gaps that need to be filled from the statement of Mr Y and that will be dealt with in due course.     Yes Chair. 
MS K:   Good morning.     Yes, Chair I understand.     (s.u.o.)     Yes.      Yes.  Yes, I do.       Yes, I am able to confirm that.     Could you please repeat the question sir?     Yes, sir.     Yes.  Yes, that is what it means.     This is not a report that was received by the Investigation Team.  The report was among documents that was found by the Investigation Team.     So I just need to...[intervenes]      Yes.     That sounds better.     Yes.  Yes, Chair.     I confirm that.  Yes, I could – one could actually draw that conclusion.     I cannot really recall but it is referred to here.  So is it okay if I just take some time to open that annexure?     Okay.     Yes.      [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes, I found it.     Yes, I have.     Yes, I see that.  I can confirm that that is what is reflected in the report.     Yes, that is what I – my interpretation is as well.     Yes, I am aware Chair.     Yes.     Yes, I can – I can confirm.  I do not know if I am allowed to point out some aspects of the invoice or I should just reserve that for my own ...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Okay.  My comment would be that there are two separate invoices of R10 million each.  And they are dated March 2016 and during 2016, respectively but the invoices were actually for the attention of Mr Thulani Dlomo but the invoices are actually only paid in January 2017.  So what I know Chair is the signature.  I am not know if I am supposed to mention whose signature it is? ADV PRETORIUS     It says authorised payment.     No, it is not an operative.  It is a signature of Mr Arthur Fraser.     So on the invoices.  It says give authorised payment dated 19/01/2017 and that was then accompanied by a TA that is taken off in parcels AMA which is also approved by Mr Fraser.  It is on page 624.       Yes.     Pleasure.     Nothing Chair.     I would partially agree with that statement but there is further information that was attached to some of these TA’s which actually gave a list of the individuals employed by AMA that were paid by us.  So that is has been submitted I think to the Commission.     Ja.     We do not necessarily have to but I think it is a point that needed to be made that it does show where the money ended up, you know, paid rendered renumeration because when you were reading the extract on page – on paragraph 6.5.8 where we said operatives could offer – that last part     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I agree that would be a fair comment.     That is a list of projects that we ourselves had been trying to actually confirm whether their existence and many documentation that proves that those projects existed and what the project establishment documents would be, saying outlining, you know, the objectives of those projects.   We have not through the information management systems of SSA and could not trace those.  The only place where these projects appear is in one of the implicated individuals TA’s and even in the cash journal, that is all.     Yes, but I have to point out that those projects seem or can only be linked to the year from 2017 onwards.  So it is not projects where – we did not see any – find any TA’s, yes.  In as far as I remember that pertaining to these projects predating the period of CDSO’s existence.       Yes, I am there.     Yes, that information we have.     Yes, I can.  It is based on official budget information, budget and expenditure information from the SSA.     Yes, I think that has already been covered earlier on, in Mr Y’s statement.     But I think what I need to comment on here is to make things clear is that it means that as we had gone through the over, I do not know, expenditure in overspending of CDSO in that period that was overlayed, it happened at the same time as expenditure on covert ops in the DG’s office.  So that is why the impact in terms of the financing should be seen in that vein.  You know, in terms of that context.     With the information and the evidence was received from our Internal Security Division because these are documents that were seized.       It is correct Chair.     [sneezing]  Excuse me.     Yes.     I can.     Yes, I do know that Chair.     Okay. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes, I do confirm that.     Pardon?      Yes, they were cash withdrawals.     Not at the same time, over a period.     Yes, I can confirm that.  There is no record, if there was, there is no record that we could get our hands on.     I just want to confirm that paragraph as correct.     I would like to confirm with the proviso that there is an amendment because it is not the budget that increased from 42 million, it is the expenditure, it is the operational expenditure that increased from 42 million to 303 million.     Yes, I can confirm that.     Yes, I do, Chair.     Excuse me, Chair?     Excuse me, Chair.     For a moment there was a technical glitch so I think …[intervenes]3     I am not sure what happened in between, so I could not – yes, I could not hear anything but now we are back.     Yes.  There is also a typo.  The contract there, it is supposed to say contract, contact expenditure.  But otherwise I agree with the sentence.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     It should say contact.     Contact expenditure.     Chair …[intervenes]     Chair, it is just – okay, may I continue?     Let me not explain it because it is not actually anything that is complicated or top secret but because it comes from the ODs which we said yesterday have not been declassified.     Maybe it would be best that I do not.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, it is, Chair.     Yes, they are correct, Chair.     I did not quite understand the question?     These are the same products we were talking – when you listed the number of projects that we have limited information on, so this is referring to that.  So I already explained that we could not trace those, so we do not have any information on whether – either the establishment of those projects or an operational plan or maybe some kind of a report or product that came from those nine to ten projects.     So I think it should be seen together, them together, in these statements.     Sorry, Chair, you are …[intervenes]     Chair is – ja, inaudible, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you for bringing that to my attention, Chair.  I would not replace the word budget there with expenditure, I would rather say budget and expenditure.     Yes, where the Chair was reading.     Yes.     Yes.     I understand what the Chair is saying.  So the amendment that I would make in the first – I agree with the first sentence but would need to expand, after budgetary allocations, would need to say “and expenditure.”     So the budget – sorry.     Okay, Chair. “The expansion of operational activities run from the office of the DG is reflected in the budgetary allocations and expenditure.  During Mr Fraser ’s tenure the budget for the office of the DG increased from approximately R42…” I mean… “…the expenditure for the office of the DG increased from approximately R42 million in the 16/2017 financial year to approximately R303 million in the 2017/2018 financial year.”     Yes, the information that we have is that during that time the budgets for the provinces were cut by 50% and that is where we have to have the boots on the ground and that is where we are actually most operational.  So – but that was cut and that is why we made this statement.  Mr Y and the team, made this statement, drew this conclusion.     No.     There are regulatory prescripts within the SSA but we are also, especially when it comes to the finances, all of those devolve from Treasury regulations.  So it is not different per se so we do not necessarily have to deviate from what Treasury has prescribed.  So I think I agree with this conclusion.  However, I would probably use a softer kind of wording and say – I do not want to announce – like confirm it as it is a gross and no authoritatively say it is gross what, what what, I would rather say it would appear, something like that.  I do not know whether it makes any difference because the challenge is, this is based on our assessment, not necessarily that we have got to engage with that office to get the explanation.     Yes.     Yes.  I agree with the statement based on the information that we have.     And also – and also – ja, I think it will become clearer as we go along, as we progress this affidavit.     I agree with this statement that there cannot be any justifiable reason for that, there are structures set up to do exactly that.     No, Chair, I – we have never seen this report.     Yes, I cannot speak on his behalf on that one.     Maybe he does have a copy.     But….     Excuse me, sorry sir.     A cough.     I request that I do not comment on this at all.     Okay, thank you.     Yes, but I want to maybe comment on is that it would not be peculiar or irregular for SSA, I mean the legitimate structures to have a presence at an ANC elective conference.  However, in this regard as I have indicated…[intervene]     Okay.     My comment is that I accept the paragraph and confirm the paragraph.  Say for, I just still want to place it on record that it would not be peculiar, in general to have SSA members at you know, because we do have special events and this should be an event that would be managed to a certain extent, by SSA in a supporting role. But what stands out for me when we looked at this is that CDSO had been closed purportedly closed in 2016 or early 2017 and most of the members of CDSO especially the co-workers, and even SSA members who were working at CDSO actually had to go home and they remained unplaced. I think they are still unplaced even today.  Yet when it was time for Nasrec, according to witness accounts of people that were part of this, they were called from home to partake in whatever this operation was, for them to be present at Nasrec.  That is all I want to just add there.      Chair.     Yes, I cannot hear you.     Yes, now it is better Chair.     Chair?     I lost you again there.      Will do Chair.     Yes, Chair.  I am drawing that and I stand to be corrected, but I am drawing that from my experience where if maybe the ANC or political party would have an event and they would ask the assistance of the Net Joints.  So not just SSA, and SSA is the co-chair of the Net Joints.  So it is co-chaired between the Police and the SSA. So that event is SSA in there who in that instance would be represented by special events and they would work together with the other stakeholders in the JCPS cluster, to secure an event, each of them playing their roles.  That is what I am trying to say that it would not be illegitimate for SSA in general to be there.      Yes, that is what I am saying, Chair.     I do not know Chair if it happens, because I am not in the special events environment.  I am not placed in a well-placed, you know to answer that, but I am guessing that the Net Joint should be in support of ANC security, but they would not be necessarily to taking a lead and also because there would be dignitaries there, the cabinet Ministers so it does justify that.  So I am not sure if, within DA there is a member of the executive, I do not know.  So I am not sure.     Yes, but all I am saying is I do not have any experience in that and I do not think I am well placed to respond to that question because I do not know, I do not have a point of reference for that.     Yes, Chair that is correct.      Yes, that was, it was taken in cash.      Okay I will go there, yes, I am there Chair.      This is one of the documents that were confiscated from Helen.      Yes, it was.     I would assume so because I just have to point out that this handwritten list of how the monies expended is not, it does not, it is not sufficient to justify and confirm how the money was expended.  So me just making a handwritten note of how I disseminated the money cannot in any environment, in my view, fly as sufficient.     Chair I – we are investigating the info but it is not just this one received.  As we indicated earlier, we are investigating all of the TA’s from 2014 to 2018, which amounted to R224million, approximately taken by the same person for covert operations, while their main function responsibility is basically admin and admin.  So this is just one of the reasons.     Well, are we saying the matter of the ANC elective conference issue or the matter of the TA?     Yes, it is Chair.     Yes, Chair.     No chair I agree with the paragraph.      I have read the paragraph but I want to on the amount but otherwise generally I do agree.      I do not know. We had not really quantify it, whatever was expended and whatever was stipend, what was legal and what was illegal?  So because it is an ongoing investigation we have not done that as yet.  We have not been able to. Ja.     Yes, please.      No comment except that I agree with this paragraph.      The first one - the first sentence there I am not sure of because I am not an expert in covert operations and prescripts but the rest I can attest to, yes.      Yes, I do.     Yes, I am able to confirm that.      Yes, this is a hundred percent correct.      These paragraphs we're actually compiled by Mr Y in conjunction with the team.  So and there is a separate document that deals with this.  so I do agree and confirm those paragraphs.  Paragraph 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9.  Yes, I confirm.      Yes.  May I just add something?      Just for purposes of timeline because we did a timeline analysis of all of these events.      In December 2014, these contracts with these four - these are the ones that we could trace - with these four entities was signed by Ambassador Dlomo as a representative of SSA.   However, those contracts are not valid and they are not legal.  There is many – there is an assessment on legal opinion on those – the state of those contracts.   I must also indicate that in certain instances the - what we have picked up is that – okay in respect to every contract that is referred to herein the section, the domicilium address for SSA is reflected - it reflects the other party’s address.   Secondly, the function or duties of those companies that are supposed to provide the services outlined actually fully or partially the entire counterintelligence mandate of SSA.   So I think for the record because we are not going to go into detail.  I would maybe appreciate it if one of these contracts would be read in terms of just the duties.     ...[Indistinct – audio break] so that - because we are talking about outsourcing of the counterintelligence mandate.  So to put it into context, it is - I think it ought to be important to read that duty.   And another additional thing that I can say here is that, when these contracts expired a junior member within the CDSO decided to explain his contract illegally without authorization.   And secondly, two of these service providers happened to be owned by friends of the project manager for some of the Project Construção and all of these other projects.   So these contracts in terms of timelines were signed in December 2014 and Projects Construção, Wave and I think Mayibuye were approved in January 2015. And by February 2015, there was already – there were already those withdrawals of 10 million, 15 million from those projects but and they were based on invoices issued by these service providers. So I just thought I should put that in the context so that you understand the flow of how things happened.     Yes.     Yes, a month before.     Yes.     Yes.     [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Ja, I am too old now to calculate.  My brain is not as sharp as it used to be.     [laughs]     Ja, safe to say that.     Yes.     Yes, sir.     No, only one.  Maybe Napa?     [Indistinct]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Yes.     Yes, Chair.       Okay.       It is page 56?     Sorry.  Ja, okay thanks.     Yes, I am there now.     Yes, there is the contract.  It does not say who is representing Napa.  It does not say who is representing SSA.  That is on the first page.  And then if we go to the scope of     ...this company.  Pardon?     I will not.  I will not.     So the company is appointed to manage for this project.     Yes, Chair.  On paragraph 2, it is saying    2.1.1.     It is a subject - I think it is sub...[intervenes]      Section, yes.     So 2.1.1.1. it reads    Yes.     Yes, I agree.  That is exactly what the issue is.     Yes, Chair.  Hence we came to the conclusion of, there was parallel intelligence machinery that was set up during that period.     Can you please repeat that summary?     Yes, that is the issue.  Which means that the legitimate SSA structure almost became absolute or even if they were working they would not have the benefit of getting whatever information namely monies redirected and rerouted to these entities. And it would mean then that there would not be – they would actually be paralysed.  SSA in its true nature would be brought to a state of paralyses because then they would get this maybe criticism that oh you are focusing on open source or you want – but you will find that people did not actually have the resources or they were not fully engaged.  That is just my view.      Yes.  Yes, Chair.  It is exactly it.     Yes and furthermore, Chair, we should also look at this in the context of the many co-workers that were also “appointed” to work within and with CODS.  So how do they fit in if the company – there are various companies that are required to do that, pay for that, and then there is also co-workers that are capacitating Sigeso(?), so it is not reality for now in my mind or there could also be possibility that those companies never did anything, it was just for invoicing purposes.     Yes, that is our assessment.     I am not aware.     Yes, sir.     Yes, it is.     Yes, yes, Chair.     I do not have the facts and the knowledge to be able to agree, I do not know whether there indeed are no SOPs or procurement in the covert space.  I am not the expert on covert operations.  So I would prefer not to comment on this one. ADV PRETORIUS     I cannot confirm.     Definitely the weak financial controls and that culture of complicity in those activities and lack of consequence management did heighten the risk of fraud, theft and, you know, money laundering actually.     I agree with that a hundred percent.     Yes, I do.     I mean, the Constitution provides for it.  However, people do not stand up and report and irregularities or having – I do not know, maybe people are scared to lose their jobs or whatever, so they just obey but – and maybe people are not informed of what PRECCA requires of all of us as people that are in positions of responsibility.  If you see anything that is illegal or somebody gives you an illegal order, it is not everybody that is bold enough to refuse, respectfully refuse an illegal order. However, there are people who are aware that they are doing illegal things, they are part of that network.  Sometimes people do not refuse but they – also their non-action also contributes to this thing proliferating.     Yes.     I agree with this paragraph in its entirety.       My only comment is that I had seen the documents, there is numerous of them and I do not know at senior level what would make a person – if you say it is an instruction, it is still an illegal instruction, so it does not necessarily have to be implemented and then you feel like you abdicate your responsibility by writing as per the instruction of the Minister.     Because there should be mechanisms – ja, there should be mechanisms for senior managers at least to know where to go to raise those objections.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     They should have.  I assume they did have because it is required even for a covert project to be established.  That operational plan should be approved by the CFO.  So CFOs should have copies of the ODs and I think they do have, especially if you refer to the paragraph above, 8.13, where if the CFO is going to write maybe recommended on the strength of compliance with ODs, that already indicates that they know the ODs. ADV PRETORIUS     We can.  We can say that because it is maybe junior level financial officers did not have access to those directives but at the level of a CFO you would have – they would have access to the ODs.     Yes, I agree with that paragraph.  We actually do have a sworn statement in this regard explaining what happened in this space particularly in the 2017/2018 financial year.     I just want to say that last line for me it is –I am only certain of one CFO.  So when you say CFOs, I cannot – I do not know, it is a small issue but it is not plural, in my view.     And – yes.  And …[intervenes]     Everything else – ja, everything that has been explained there we actually had – because we have an expert in the team that deals with these things, it was actually tested and there is historical information on this.  So I do support and agree with this paragraph.     I agree with both, Chair.     Yes, as I explained yesterday, Chair, that CDSO did not have an APP so they could not note the budget so that we can manage, exercise control.  So on the system, the finance system, there is a built-in feature which is called a funds availability check.  That funds availability check is a tool for the budget controller to be able to see if – when they try to take a TA to see if there is a budget, there are funds available for that.   Now in this period of CDSO, the funds availability check function was switched off by the then CFO and that is what enabled CDSO to be able to expend like a 30 million that is meant for a year to use all of that, to exhaust those funds within three months and then allowed them to still keep on taking TAs because the funds availability check function was deactivated. And I also agree with this on the basis that there is documentation that proves that when that CFO went on a work trip for four days, other financial staff, staff within that unit, took that gap and applied to whoever was acting those four days, requested that the funds availability check function be reactivated and the person did exactly that. But when the CFO came back from a work trip he came and deactivated that funds availability check again and that, for me, showed that it was deliberate.  So that is what we found as the team, Chair.     I think I comment in detail yesterday, Chair, on that one, on line functions issues.     And so I think…     Yes.     It is true.  Even in submissions you can see that it did not go via them and if the funds availability check is disabled, obviously this will not – the budget controllers will not be able to exercise their functions.  So I suspect that that is why – I do not if it came out anywhere in the affidavit, that is why it is alleged but it is also proven in documents that the CFO then had instructed and directed that CDSO only uses and they channel all of their TAs to one specific financial officer who would process all of these transactions and this went on for years.  So this is one individual that was specialising in CDSO whatever, the TAs and settlements and all of that.     These are the views of the investigation team, this is exactly what we found.  It is one of the findings so I agree with that sentence.     It is towards the end of the file.     Yes, Chair, I am there.     What is the question?     It can never be, Chair.     Because it does not have a say who is giving the money, what the money is for, who is receiving the money and will never be able to trace and I note that in page 872…     In page 872 that is a certificate confirming that it means that the person did not have records and receipts to account for this money and there is an incomplete voucher form where Helen signed for this 2 million Euros and it was approved by Mr Arthur Fraser.  So …[intervenes]     The pseudonym Helen had signed there as project administrator who was submitting this incomplete voucher for 2 million Euros and it was approved by Mr Arthur Fraser and when you look at the authorisation thereof, the – I  just want to check the green form, the temporary advance form.   Okay, where the money is taken, there is always a comment in most of pseudonym Helen’s TA, there is always a comment by Raymond that a second TA should be allowed or member can take second TA as allowed by the DG. So there is that consistency and also these incomplete vouchers. And what we also need to note about that receipt that you referred us to, 864, Chair, is that there is numerous of these receipts that we found and filed and some of them just have the signature of the recipient and the rest is blank and our conclusion from that is that it is a blank cheque.  You can write any amount, the recipient has already signed.     So there were a lot of those as well which shows that there was no accountability because it then raises the question that how did the people clear these temporary advances on the system?  If you can see that the receipts are not even there and the disbursement of his funds actually even just a piece of paper where he just write people’s names or codenames and just write R1 million. So those are the things that we are raising in this – Mr Y and the team are raising in this affidavit, in this section.     Yes, Chair.     Yes I am present Chair.     Page what, sorry?     I have just got to look for that.  What is the page number again, I am so sorry?     Yes.       Yes, based on the information we have, yes, I agree with that statement.     It is a management, cash management company.       So I do not know what it stands for.      The company, as far as I understand, the company does not hold the cash, the cash is in the bank but the company assists in transporting. ADV PRETORIUS     Because at that at the time, that is what I understood.     Yes, this conclusion is based on several documents that we saw where she was placing orders for cash and also, this was corroborated by one of the implicated individuals who said they were responsible for faxing these instructions to the company, to you know, when each time they wanted to order cash.     Yes, yes, it is correct.     In relation to the sentence that follows immediately after that, it actually relates, it is in plural, the plural will stand.       I do not know if I am making it clear but if you read the next sentence, what is described in the next sentence, actually applied to more than one CFO.      Yes, it is Chair.      Yes.     Yes, but on the verbal instructions, what we mean there is, it is for cash, for withdrawals of cash in terms of the TA system.  The CFO, is the, as far as I understand is the only person that can approve the disbursement of cash to a member above R50 000,00.  So there is an area for the CFO to sign for any amount above R50 000. So almost all the withdrawals by CDSO members, because they were cash as I said whether it is R19million, whether it is whatever amount, the CFO’s as we have it on record from witnesses would call, allegedly called the cashiers to give instructions to say, do you have R19million there because somebody is coming to withdraw it and if they do not they would instruct them to order money from the same cash management company and the money would be delivered and given to the various CDSO members or the office of the DG.      Yes, that is correct.     Yes, Chair.      Yes, they are Chair.     The first and second sentences, I am not sure because I am not a finance person and as much as we got that information, I cannot confirm the assertions in the first sentence and the second sentence in terms of the reporting cycles and all that.  However, the latter part I can confirm. In fact, the permission was granted to give R100million, but SSA had apparently requested R200million extra over and above what we had.  So there are documents to that effect. So I agree with the last part, the latter part of that paragraph.     Yes, I think it links to what I said earlier, that the budgets of the provincial offices were allegedly cut by 50% in that period, so it ended up being the money was more concentrated in the office of the DG.     Yes, I do recall that.      Yes, we covered that it is correct.     Yes.     I mean it says suggests an intention to resuscitate the operation model and I do not really know the full extent and the detail of that operating model but in as far as it related, it relates to issues of rentals and leases.  I did see similarities in that regard.  So I can say that where that sentence that starts with in particular similar irregularities relating to the renting of safe houses and that occurred Pan we uncovered during our raid, that sentence I agree with fully.  The other part I am not saying it is incorrect all I can say - what I am saying is, I am not 100% certain.     Yes, I do.     Yes, I can confirm that the paragraph is correct.     Yes, I can confirm that we do have a copy of this authorisation and as much as it has serious financial implications, the CFO was not included in that but it does however, say the CFO will be later consulted on it, but it was approved.  So the matter is still under investigation, because we are not sure if this was ever executed.     Yes.     Yes, I am able to comment on this section because the Project Veza team had received the documents, retrieved all of those vetting files and we were able to analyse all of those files, including who the individuals vetted were, who the vetting officers involved were and the completeness of the files themselves.  So I can confirm paragraph 9.1 in its entirety, 9.2 and 9.3.     Yes, I agree with that paragraph.     Yes.     Yes, I do agree.     Yes, that is correct, sir.     Yes, that is how we understand them.     Yes, I can confirm that, that was the files that I was referring to that we analysed.     Yes, I do.     I agree Chair.     Yes, I do agree Chair.     I agree with all of them and with regards to the firearms, we do have several statements that support that. But I have to indicate that we have to maybe in on 9.7,3 on the firearms issue where we say including automatic rifles, and maybe we could add some of which remain unaccounted for.  As DG had indicated that some were recovered and we submitted a list of these four ballistics a several of them, I think they were like 34 or so that have been submitted for ballistics testing to the SAPS.      Yes, this is correct.  It is what the investigation has found out and with regards to the Protection Unit, we were able to actually get names from some of the implicated individuals on who has been deployed within that space.     Yes, I can confirm.  It is just a view but I think the view is accurate.  It is important for members of the public and government to understand that we have loyal and patriotic officials within the SSA who are responsible for this process and they do their job as it is supposed to be done. But unfortunately around the time, the period under review, this happened and I hope it has been remedied right now but we – it should not discourage anybody from cooperating with vetting processes that are undertaken by the SSA.       Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     I can confirm this with the advice that we revised the date there, I do not think the period is accurate, this process, according to my understanding, and that quite early on it did not go up to 2018.  Although our – the focus of the team – the scope you know in terms of the clear dispensation it was in 2018.  But it does not necessarily mean that this process, the vetting structure existed in 2018.  I – is that clear Mr Chair?     I do not know the date offhand but what I can say is that the personal who was responsible for this project had handed over these files to another unit within SSA.  So that date – I do not have that information at hand.  So I think that date and that year would be the safest to utilise in this regard.     But we do have records of that.     That is what – yes, that is what we were told by the project manager.     I agree with the statements.     Yes.  Yes, and it is also – it is also helping me to withdraw that state – you remember that period where we said from 2013 to 2018 ...[intervenes]      ...the structure operated.  Because I thought she had handed in – instead of the discrepancy in terms of when she handed this hand but it does not necessarily mean that this was – the structure was operating when she handed in the files because initially they did this work and then the pseudonym Mandy later on became the project manager for some of the CDSO operations and projects that we had already covered yesterday including Tin Roof. So I think between – once the vetting was done on the individual that we identified, they then – she was then channelled to do other things, other work that are now pseudo related.       According to the report to her, she was not conducting vetting.  Okay.  She was conducting vetting under the umbrella, under the office of the DDG Counterintelligence.     But it so happened that most of the people that were vetted were co-workers who were then deployed in CDSO.  However, there are some other people, senior members, management that was vetted by her structure as well.     So ...[intervenes]      No, you are not correct Chair.  So ...[intervenes]      That process started when that team was constituted in 2013.     So that is when Mandy started working because she was project leader from the beginning of the process.  I am guessing until the end.     That ...[intervenes]      Now we – she did conduct the vetting.  She was leading the team and she admits to it because it was during an interview which is recorded and transcribed.     Yes, yes.  Yes, Chair.  Because you see later on, I think in this affidavit, we talk about how these files were not loaded onto our official SVIS System.   That is where the vetting files are loaded, you know, in terms of the process.  So these files were kept in hard copy and not loaded on the system as is required.       Yes, it is correct Chair.     Yes, it is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Yes, I agree with that.     Six is correct.  Five I am not so certain because I – because I do not work in that space.  But I am not sure what is significant responses.  So I do not want to misinterpret but I trust the vetting experts in the team that their analyses is correct.  So based on that I would just confirm.     Yes, I do agree Chair.     I agree with all of those points from 9.15.1 to 9.15.7.     Yes, Chair. ADV PRETORIUS     I want to confirm that based on inputs by the directorate sited there.  So I agree with that.  I confirm 9.16.1.     The distinction is very important in that the – as far as I understand, the template I think in terms of the – whatever the emblem is used and the type of paper and what each – there should be that distinction between the two.   I do not know the detail of it.  So I cannot really get technical about it and should be able to get evidence from the people involved maybe you will get more clarity.   But what I can say is that in terms of our security clearance certificates, there is a number allocated because you would find that when a vetting file is open there is a number and it is loaded on the system.   There is a number that is allocated that is going to be the security clearance number.  But in this regard, the certificates would – did not bear such a number.  They only bore ID numbers of the individuals that they vetted.     H’m.     Yes.     No.  No, they were not Chair.     Yes, that is what we understand as the team, yes.     Yes, I think that is what I was trying to explain a few minutes ago Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, they are Chair.     ..in the end.     That is correct sir everything that is in that paragraph.  I can confirm.  I have seen the file and ja.     Yes, that is correct.     No, I am not aware.     No, I do not have any information on that Chair.     That is correct Chair.     I am not aware of it being declassified.      I just want to look at my list of pseudonyms.  I can     That is needed and – ja.     It is accurate, Chair, according to our analysis of the file.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes, it is correct, Chair.     It is correct, I am just not sure about the pseudonym there.  I cannot currently recall whether it was given to Wendy or Philane but the essence of that is correct, of the paragraph is correct.     It is either Philane or Wendy.  It could be Wendy because most the stuff was done by Wendy in terms of loading.     A pseudonym, yes.     That is correct, Chair.     That is what we understood in our engagements with the relevant people in SAPS.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, when we checked last year for his details we found that under his name it is just a series of zeros.  Under this ID number it is a series of zeros.  We only used the – we used the clearance certificate number to search on the system.  So that was irregular in itself.     Yes it is, Chair.     Yes, yes, I do know.     I can confirm that.  Yes, they are, Chair.     Yes, they do, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is a fair summary, Chair.     It is correct, it is correct, Chair.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, you do have it right, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is what we made to understand by the experts in that area.     It is correct, Chair.     Yes, that is correct, Chair.     That is correct.  That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.     That is correct, Chair.  In fact we opened a case against this member last year because these firearms had been missing 2015.  So for four years the member did had a chance to report the SAPS what happened and the armoury people had advised the member to do so, but they did not.     Yes it is.     And it is also confirmed by sworn statements of the – this event, an incident, unfortunate incident is actually concerned, did happen.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes, that is correct.     That is correct, Chair.     Yes, they are correct.     May I not respond to that question, Chair?     Yes, I do not mean, I do not know.  I am asking that I do not answer this particular question, Chair.     Yes it is correct.  The last time that I checked that was still the case, this was last year late.     Yes I do, I do share those views.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Yes it is Chair.     Sorry Chair?     Excuse me Chair?     Yes please I would appreciate that opportunity.     Thank you Chair.  I just want to indicate that these practices and these – the conditions under which the armoury people had to work under are very concerning and I must indicate that those particular individual were affected and they are still affected today because they know the SOP’s, they know the regulations and having – one of them actually told me and the team that each time there is a media report on whether it is an assassination, whether it is whatever they always get nervous because they are thinking we hope it is not one of our firearms.   So I just want to underline the commitment, the integrity and the – of those officials, that is all Chair.     The – let me just say I concern and align myself with the entire conclusion, all the paragraphs.     I align myself with the paragraph. ADV PRETORIUS     Yes I do Chair.     Yes I do.     I do Chair.     Chair?     I could not hear you, I could not hear you yes, I heard that there is a possibility that I may have to come back and that is where it is up to – beyond that I did not hear anything.     Thanks so much Chair.     I am here.  I am here Chair.     I appreciate the opportunity Chair, although the circumstances are actually painful to me in relation to Mr Y, but I just want to say to the Commission and to make sure that it is recorded, that the majority of officials that are within the SSA are courteous, are qualified and are committed and all they want to do is work and serve the constitution, so in no way should I request this evidence should not in any way be used to paint everybody with the same brush, because I do think that – it is just that they have not had the opportunity to express themselves or they are not as – I don’t know, maybe stupid like me to just come up and say the things that I have revealed, but I do think that we have to acknowledge that they are committed and we hope that we can rebuild our organisation just for the sake of our country. Thank you.    Thank you Mr Pretorius. 
INQUIRY RESUMES:      
COUNSEL: Thanks, Chair. Can we comfortably sit down and avoided interrupting Mr Pretorius because we do not want to be accused of being rude and being told to sit.  But there it is that this whole portion of the report that has been read into evidence now or interact with, the witness before this Commission has indicated on at least two occasions that she is not willing to comment on the report.  And well, perhaps she also indicated that she does not know this.  So it serves no purpose for the purpose of this witness, for this to be read into the record.  Now, the reality is that this witness is here to confirm the affidavit or the statement of Mr Y.  So to the extent that she is not confirming that statement, it is improper for it, then for this reports to be read into record, at least now. Perhaps there are people that will talk to this, we have no objection to it and if there are people that ought to have spoken to it, if they have not spoken to it, then they can be recalled there is nothing that stops them from being recorded.  But it is for the purpose of this witness, it is improper for what she is not going to confirm, to be read into the record, nevertheless. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chair, we are not taking this matter any further, we do not necessarily agree but we will not be taking it further.
