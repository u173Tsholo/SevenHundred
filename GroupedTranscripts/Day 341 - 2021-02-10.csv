CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    It is ten o’clock we should start at ten o’clock.    Whoever needs to go to wherever they m must go before ten.  Ten o’clock we must start.  Okay let us start.    Please administer the oath or affirmation.    I am sorry.  I am not sure that we can hear you might have to take your mask off.    Ja.  Okay.    Thank you; you may be seated Dr Naidoo.    Okay.    Thank you I have got it.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Ja.    The affidavit of Dr Pathmanathan Naidoo starting at page 3 will be admitted as Exhibit U36.1.    The affidavit of Dr Pathmanathan Naidoo starting at page 38 is admitted as Exhibit U36.2.    The affidavit of Dr Pathmanathan Naidoo starting at page 47.1 is admitted as Exhibit U36.3.    And if I can ask…    Was it like part of the deal that you will charge us low prices but in return we will allow you to make money.    With the export section of the mine?    So to make up for whatever losses you may suffer on the domestic side.    Okay.    Hm.   Well the hardship clause as you understand it or as you understood it at the time was it meant to cater for a situation where it would appear for example that Glencore did not do a due diligence before taking this contract over and it looks like later on when it was complaining about the coal price being too low and suffering hardship that seems to be at least in part because it did not do what it is supposed to have done from the beginning because one would have thought that if you want to take over somebody else’s contract such as this one of the things you would look at particularly when you talk about the – such a long term contract is – is there a provision in the contract for the escalation or the increase of the price annually or at whatever intervals because the problem seems to have been that the parties were locked into this price that had been determined a long time before.    And then when it complained about hardship one gets the impression but if you had done your – your homework and you had raised this issue you would not be in this situation.    But you can enlighten me maybe there is something I – I do not understand but that was one of my queries about Glencore’s OCM’s so called hardship.    Yes but is your answer that the hardship that OCM while it was under Glencore complained about was not largely due to it not having done its homework?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja, ja.    Yes okay alright.    Mr Seleka.    Now are you talking about the period where OCM/Glencore was pushing for an increase of – on the coal price?    Is that what you are talking about?    Now I asked you a question earlier on and you gave an answer but I think although the information you gave me was I think useful it did not go to the question namely whether what – whether the situation that Glencore/OCM found itself in when it invoked the hardship clause was the situation for which the hardship clause had been created?    In other words was it – did it fit within as you understood the kind of hardship that was contemplated?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    But of course ultimately OCM did not pursue the arbitration process to the end arising out of the invocation of the hardship clause.  As I recall you – if you invoke the hardship clause if the parties meet and cannot reach agreement you go to arbitration.    Is it correct that Eskom’s position was okay you have invoked the hardship clause we can go through it and let the arbitrator decide?    No, no but what I am saying is I think you – you agree and I wanted you to confirm that once a party to that coal supply agreement had invoked a hardship clause.    The hardship clause.    The route ultimately if the parties could not reach agreement.    Is arbitration.    Yes.  But I am saying as I recall the matter ultimately never reached arbitration.    But I am asking whether Eskom’s position was that you OCM have invoked the hardship clause and we are happy for that to take its course.    And so to speak we will see what happens.    But it is your right to take that route.    Yes.  Okay alright.  So – so OCM to the extent that they may complain about Eskom having taken a hard line on the issue of – on their request or proposal for an increase of the coal price on the basis that they were suffering hardship to the extent that Glencore/OCM criticised Eskom’s hard line.  One answer from Eskom would be but if you thought we were unjustified in taking the hard line that we took you had a remedy.    Namely to pursue arbitration up to the end.    Because if the arbi – if you pursued arbitration and the arbitrator found against us as Eskom we would comply with the award of the arbitrator.    You did not pursue that line.    And it may well be that the reason you did not pursue it because you realised that you were not going to have a strong case.    Yes.    Okay.     Yes.     The operational arrangements that you would make, would they not result in OCM’s victory in the arbitration awarded being an empty victory?     Yes.  Well, I am sure you might not make look into it further but yes I am concerned whether you     [laughs]     You see that is what Eskom was planning.     That is why they were saying    [laughs]     Okay.  Mr Seleka.     It was how much?     Oh, billion rands?     H’m.     So was the...  It is quite clear from what you say, what you have said, that as far as you are concerned, your intention – and you may go further and say you think it was the intention of all the board members, I am not sure, you can deal with that just now.  Your intention was that Eskom was granting or the board was approving prepayment to OCM under Glencore.     And not to Tegeta.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, okay alright.     Okay.     Somebody must assist him to get to the right bundle.     They will identify the bundle and give it to you Dr Naidoo.     What is the page Mr Seleka?     H’m.     Which document are you starting with, 281?     Okay alright.     Okay.     Okay.     But he – the submission that he has confirmed as having served in both, is it the one 281 or the one 286?     Both?     Okay alright.     Oh.     Oh, okay alright.     Okay let us do ...[intervenes]      ...one at a time.     Probably – should we not start with his document?     But would you know.  Ja.     I am sorry Mr Seleka.  Maybe you are right.  We should start with his submissions because you – as I understand it, his note was made after ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Let us start with what persuaded him.     What told him what this was about.       Sorry, Dr Naidoo.  You are too fast.     I thought you were starting at page 281.  Now I hear you are talking about 283.     Okay.     Well, we must start first.  Oh, you must tell me what this document is that starts at 281.     281.  How did it come before you and what was it about.     Then you can take me to 283.     Yes?     Yes.     Yes.     Hang on one second.  Just for the sake of completeness.  What you were reading at 279 was the heading which is the minutes of that meeting that you mentioned.     But let us say what the meeting was about.     Matters for approval.     There, 6.1.     A request to approve the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal ...[intervenes]      ...(Pty) Ltd.     That was the subject.     Okay.       Yes.     Yes?     H’m.     H’m?     I am sorry.  You are reading from 3.4.1?     Okay.  Just restart afresh.     What you did not mention or unless I missed it, which is important just to say at 3.4 deals with benefits of the advance purchase of coal.     And 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 that you have just read ...[intervenes]      Oh, that is heading, the benefits.     Okay.     H’m?     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     H’m.     Well, Mr Seleka and Dr Naidoo it quite – a lot of things... [laughs]     I think it is important to – for the sake of business.     To just go back to the minutes of the Investment and Finance Committee that he referred to.     279.  And say this is the outcome of the that meeting.     And if the reasons for that outcome are set out there to articulate them.     And this was now – or then the question of the minutes of the board where the approval was given, where would that be?     The board itself, ja.  Because I am assuming that ...[intervenes]      After the Investment and Finance Committee has ...[intervenes]      ...has come to this conclusion, it must be the recommendation or ...[intervenes]      ...or its decision must go to the board for approval.     Uh...     Ja, they will ...[intervenes]      Ja. [laughs]     Okay that is fine.  As long as we get to say here is the formal approval by the board and confirming what was before the board, whether it was the same documents that were before the Investment and Finance Committee.     H’m.     Well, let me ask this question while Mr Seleka is looking at whatever he is looking at.  Dr Naidoo...     Are you able to say, having been part of that telephonic meeting of the Investment and Finance Committee that the understanding of the committee was that it was recommending approval of this prepayment on the basis that the prepayment was for OCM/Glencore?     You are able to confirm that?     And you are the chairperson of the committee.     Yes.     Now you have said that this executive summary starting at page 281, served before both the committee as well as the board.  When you look at paragraph 2.1.2 on page 281, that is that summary, that submission for Round-robin. That paragraphs makes it clear that the Group Chief Executive of Eskom together with the Group Executive for Generations and Chief Financial Officer, I suspect that those were Mr Brian Molefe and Mr Koko and Mr Singh, were being authorised to negotiate and conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement, not with the owners or current owners at the time of OCM but with the proposed owners. How – did you see that at the ...[intervenes]      Yes.     But if you saw that, how could you and your committee think that you were authorising prepayment to Glencore?  Because the proposed owners of OCM were not Glencore?     H’m?     No ...[intervenes]      I understand that but I am saying the words in paragraph 2.1.2 ...[intervenes]      ...were starring you in the face and they were not saying the request is that you must authorise these three officials of Eskom to negotiate and conclude an agreement with the owners of OCM.  Owners as at that time.  It was saying you are requested, you are deem requested to authorise these three officials of Eskom ...[intervenes]      ...to negotiate with and conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement with the proposed owners.  Who was the proposed owners at the time?     H’m.     But that makes it worse for your case     Yes.     Yes.     And at that stage, OCM under Glencore.     Yes.     Yes.     No, but I am saying to you.  How could you think along those lines when in black and white the executive summary, the Round-robin submission that was placed before your committee ...[intervenes]      ...and before the board made it quite clear what you have been requested to authorise, that this submission, this summary did not ask your committee or the board to authorise the three officials of Eskom to conclude an agreement with the owners of OCM because if it had said owners of OCM, it would have meant Glencore/OCM because those are the owners.  It said proposed owners.     So I am asking how you could have – you said you did see this, if I understand ...[intervenes]      So if you so decide, why did you not     But what I am putting to you, Dr Naidoo …[intervenes]     What I am putting to you is that precisely the point you are emphasising counts against the decision that you took.  It counts against the version you have given that you were intending to authorise prepayment to the Glencore/OCM because that is what I should be saying to you, to say but why did you not say change the submission …[intervenes]     …because we cannot authorise the conclusion of a contract with proposed owners when they are current owners, what we are going to authorise is the conclusion of a contract with the current owners, you must change the submission.     And, you see, it makes it difficult – it raises the question how was it possible that x number of members of the investment and finance committee all did not see this point?  How is it possible that the entire board also did not see this point because Dr Ngubane I think also gave evidence along the lines that you have given.     But how could none of you say but hang on, change this submission.     Because now …[intervenes]     It may well be that somebody might say well, despite the fact that your committee and the board did not raise this issue about proposed owners.  When you look at the final resolution maybe it was worded in a way which made it clear that you were authorising prepayment to Glencore/OCM and not to Tegeta but those who asked your committee and the board to authorise payment would be entitled to say it was there in black and white, we did not mislead you, we wrote it there and you said we should go ahead but now you are turning around and say all of you are now saying but as far as we were concerned we were authorising prepayment to Glencore but they say it is there, it is black and white, how come?     Mr Seleka?     Yes.     Before the board can we go to the investment and finance committee decision.     Let us go back and let us see whether there is anything there that suggests that they were not approving what had exactly been placed before them by way of the submission or executive summary. In terms of the outcome they specified – they said something that suggests quite clearly that there were not authorising what they had been asked to authorise.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay, just before – I take it that they are the same as…     Okay, let me just…     On the minutes at 279 and 280 there does not appear to be anything that suggests either way.     Yes.  And you say I must also look where, Mr Seleka?     The signed one is exactly the same.     Yes.     Let me just get there.     Okay, okay.     Okay.  And then let us go to the board to see – we know it was the same submission that was placed before them, ja.     Ja.     Yes but that was not going to change, is it not, because it is a question of whether you talk about Optimum coal under Glencore or Optimum Coal …[intervenes]     Tegeta, that is the – still OCM but …[intervenes]     Ja.  The question is under which one.     But after Tegeta took it over did it not remain and Ltd but as a subsidiary of – I do not know whether Oakbay or Tegeta?     I do not remember seeing anything saying they changed the name.     Ja.  So it is a question of who was in control of the entity.     Was it Glencore or was it – so but let us go to the …[intervenes]     The board resolution.     Okay.  Yes?     Oh, before that I am just looking at the resolution.     You see, with the board, their resolution is quite clear because they take paragraph 2.1.2 of the executive summary that I read earlier on, they take it as it     But this is clear and categorical.     What the board approved was not the conclusion of an agreement, a pre-purchase of coal agreement between the owners of OCM at the time and Eskom but it authorised pre-purchase of coal agreement with the proposed owners.     So – and you were part of that board.     Yes.     And again – and Dr Ngubane also gave evidence along the same lines as yourself.     And what is troubling me is how it is possible for so many members of the board not to have seen what is written here in black and white.  That is what is troubling me.     H’m.     The board was about how many people at the time, about 12?     About 12?     And some of the board members were people with high qualifications.     You know?     Yes, but you see, when you serve in a body such as the board of an entity such as Eskom, or any board…     You are playing a kind of supervisory role over the executive management.     You have oversight.     And you have to put the interests of the entity at the forefront.     Whatever decisions you take you have got to ask yourself the question is this decision in the interests of this entity?     You see, obviously, all decisions you take must be lawful and comply with the law, you know?     So it is – I mean, when I read that this executive summary for the first time but now I do not know, maybe he drew my attention to it but I think I picked up this proposed owners, negotiate and put an agreement with proposed owners, that sounded strange, you know?  But maybe it was because of the evidence that I had heard for some time.     But is it troubling me that a board, members of the board of such an important state entity know that they are being asked to authorise payment to an entity of a very large amount.     1,6 billion.     And they do not take the trouble to make sure that they are authorising the conclusion of a contract with the right entity.     They do not take the trouble to say let us make sure that this money goes to the right entity or the right person, it must not go to somebody we do not intend.     Hang on, hang on, no, no, Dr Naidoo –and we have been dealing with this point.  If the money goes to Glencore and your resolution says it should go to Tegeta then whoever sends it to – the money to Glencore, is doing something contrary to your resolution and they are not allowed to do that, they must comply with the resolution of the board.     You see?     There is a great responsibility…     On the board when it deals with monies and other decisions and I am saying particularly when you are being asked to authorise payment of such a large amount from Eskom to somebody else, there is a greater responsibility for you to scrutinise the documents placed before you to make sure that there is proper justification for this money to be authorised, there is payment to be made, is it being – are you authorising it to be paid to the right person and so on and so on?  And certainly what is in the resolution of the board here suggests to me that to say the least the board was very negligent.  It may well be that it is much more than that but I am not saying that at this stage and it may well be that within the board it was negligence on the part of some members but on the part of some other members, maybe they knew more than others, I do not know.  But it is troubling.     You accept that.     Yes. Okay.     Mr Seleka, we have gone past quarter past.     But I do not know whether you would like to complete the evidence of Dr Naidoo, it depends how much time.  I am easy to adjourn now, we continue with him or complete with him if you are not far from finishing.     It just depends how much you have covered of what you intended to cover.     Ja, no, that is fine.  Let us take the tea adjournment now.  We will resume at twenty to twelve.  We adjourn.     Just to round off from my part, Dr Naidoo.  So your situation is not that you did not see that you were being asked to authorise the three Eskom officials to negotiate and conclude pre-purchase of coal agreement with the proposed owners, you did see that is what the submission said but – and you did not raise an issue.     But somehow you say you thought that – or your intention was to authorise the conclusion of pre-purchase of coal agreement between Eskom and OCM as owned by Glencore.     Yes and – but if somebody says how you could have thought you were doing that in the light of this clear statement, are you able to explain how you could have thought along those lines in the light of the statement?  In other words, I just want to have your explanation.     Okay, alright, I have made – I have said what I have to about that reason, ja.     Okay, Mr Seleka?     I see that I think we have taken longer with Dr Naidoo than you had planned but that is probably my fault not yours, I have had quite a number of questions to ask but I think it was important evidence.     Okay, Mr Seleka.     H’m?     Yes.     Well, you are entitled then to the title of professor and I think if you were in Germany you would be called Professor Doctor.     Thank you very much Professor Naidoo, we appreciate you coming to assist the Commission, you are now excused.     Okay.  Yes, Mr Seleka?     Okay, alright.  Do I need to adjourn to allow something to be set up or not necessarily?     If I adjourn?     Ja, okay, let me adjourn for five minutes.  We adjourn.     Good morning Ms Klein.     Welcome back even though you are not here physically, welcome back to the Commission and thank you for coming back to continue with your evidence.   Registrar please administer the oath of affirmation.     Okay, thank you.      Do you propose to use the red pagination?     Well the first one which I said page 7 black numbers, page 2 red numbers.     That one deals with the suspension.      Yes, but will you remember what exhibit number it should have been?     That is what should have been done.     Okay and she confirmed everything?     Yes.     Bundle 2, Eskom Bundle 2 page 7 black numbers or page 2 red numbers, your first affidavit.  The affidavit that comes first in that bundle.  Yes, you did confirm previously that this is your affidavit and that the first signature at page 29 black numbers, page 24 red numbers is your signature, is that right?     Yes, okay.  You want to admit it as exhibit U14?     Ms Venete Klein’s affidavit starting at page seven black numbers, page 2 red numbers in Eskom Bundle 2 is admitted as Exhibit U14.1.      And that is together with its annexures.     The affidavit of Ms Venete Klein starting at page 400.1 is admitted as Exhibit U14.2.      The affidavit of Ms Venete Klein starting at page 400.43 is admitted with its annexures as Exhibit U14.3.      Yes, try and cover everything that needs to be highlighted with Ms Klein so that we do not reach a point where she no longer wishes to appear before me.  So let us try and cover everything if we can, ja. ADV SELEKA     I am not suggesting Ms Klein that you have had had enough of the Commission.     Yes, okay Mr Seleka.     Ja, if you can.     Yes, you can if you can remember but if we need to go and have a look at the document then we will have a look.     Mr Seleka, continue.    Ja okay please do.    Well do you want to do that now so that it is in when any reference is made to it – we know it is in.    Or you do not have enough copies?    Ja okay.  Let that be done.    It would be better …    Ja just respond and then when the affidavit comes we can see whether you wish to add anything.    Mr Seleka.    I am sorry you say the evidence she sets out where?    Okay.  Thank you.    Bundle 15 will not be necessary anymore or will it come back?    Okay.    Ja.  Okay you may continue.    We need to take the lunch break it is one o’clock.    We are going to take the lunch break and we will resume at two o’clock.    We adjourn.     Okay let us continue Mr Seleka.     Sorry, Mr Seleka.  Are you talking about the CEO’s report or are you talking about the minutes of the meeting of ...[intervenes]      And where would I find them?     Okay Ms Klein.     Did we forget ...[intervenes]      Did we forget to allow Ms Klein’s lawyers to place themselves on record today?     [laughs]     Shall we correct that now?     Ja.     [laughs]     Oh, okay.  [laughs]     Oh, there is an understanding between the two of you.     Okay I will leave it at that. [laughs]     Ja.     H’m?     Thank you, thank you.     But I have got the minutes that are or that...  I do not know what page they start but I have got 841 in front of me.     Okay.     Well, was not there an OCH being the holding company at Glencore/OCM?  Was there not a holding company called OCH?     Ja.     Okay.     Well, I was going to say Mr Seleka, please ask the question much directly because we know what the whole issues is about.  Ms Klein, I do not know whether you might have listened when or watched when Dr Naidoo was giving evidence?  Did you?  You did?     Yes, okay.  So you know the context.     The Executive summary or submission that was placed before the board made it clear in paragraph 2.1.2 that the board was being asked to authorise three officials of Eskom.     The Group CEO, Group Executive for Generation and Chief Financial Officer to negotiate and conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement with the proposed owners of OCM, that is coal supplier.  You accept – do you know that the proposed owners of OCM were Tegeta?     I am sorry.  Just ...[intervenes]      I am sorry.  Just repeat the sentence with which you started, bear in mind...     Did you at that time read this Executive summary?     Yes.     H’m.     H’m?     Yes.     So are you able to say, as did Dr Naidoo, you did see the paragraph, that is 2.1.2, and you did notice that it said the agreement was to be concluded with the proposed owners of OCM but nevertheless you understood the issue differently. Or is the position that you did not take note of the fact that paragraph 2.1.2 sought your authorisation as the board that the three Eskom officials should conclude an agreement, not with the owners of OCM at the time but with the proposed owners.   So I just want to establish whether you did see it like Dr Naidoo but thought in a certain way or whether you read it but you did not take note of what was being said here?     Well, as I said to Dr Naidoo.  What troubles me is that as a member of the board you are being asked to authorise quite a large – a payment of a large amount of money from Eskom and the document being provided to you as the board by management makes it quite clear that what they are asking you to authorise is the conclusion of pre-purchase of coal agreement with people who are not yet owners of OCM. But it looks like either the whole board saw that but did not appreciate or did not note its significance or maybe some did not read it but you said you probably read it but you probably did not understand.   And you must tell me if I am putting words in your mouth.  Understand its significance.  Am I correct that that is the effect of what you are saying?     H’m.     H’m.     But you see, as I see it, it may well be that the whole idea from management that they should ask the board to authorise that pre-purchase of coal agreement be concluded with the proposed owners of OCM was a wrong idea, was a bad idea and maybe much more than that. But it does not seem to me that the board can criticise management for having mislead them on that point because they put it here. They did not say owners of OCM.  They said proposed owners.  And this was a board, some of whose members are quite well-qualified with high qualifications. And it is just difficult to understand how it is possible that so many people on the board did not pick this up because...  I mean, you say Ms Klein that paragraph is a standard paragraph in your submission.   That I understand because these things are based on a certain template or format that you know that if they place a submission like this before you, paragraph 1 is about what the whole issues is about, paragraph 2 resolution.  Then they specify. But I want to suggest to you that that part which says resolution required, and that is where paragraph 2.1.2 falls under, that must be one of the most important parts in this document that board members must look at because they know they have been asked to authorise something. So the first thing they must understand is.  What are we being asked to authorise?  And if it is payment, there are certain pertinent questions they must look for when they look for answers for in this document. One, what is the payment for?  Two, who is it to be made to – who is to be made to?  Why?  What are the reasons?  What is the justification?   And the larger the amount that is talked about, the higher the obligation on the board or members of the board to scrutinise the document properly.  Would you not agree with me on all of these propositions?     H’m?     H’m?     H’m?     H’m.     H’m?     But you ...[intervenes]      But you would agree, would you not, that if you are a member of a Board, of the Board of an entity such as Eskom and you are authorised to, you are asked to authorise such a serious, such a big amount to be paid, one of your duties is to make sure that you only authorise payment of this amount to the right person, because if you authorise payment to a wrong party that would be very serious, is it not?   So ...[intervenes]      Yes, what I am suggesting to you which would apply to all the board members is there probably was a failure on the part of the board to do its job properly if it authorised payment to an entity that if they agreed to a request for authorisation to an entity – to one entity but they thought they were authorising payment to another entity and yet there was a document in front of them telling them exactly the entity that the executive management, the management, wanted to be paid the money.  Would you not concede that?     Yes.     Yes.  No, I accept that.     Yes, you see, what I would suggest is that if you – you needed to make sure that you authorised the right entity to be paid and I suggest that reading this paragraph 2.1.2, once you saw that it was saying the payment must be to the proposed owners, I think the immediate question should have been why pay to proposed owners and not to current owners and that is when you should have asked management please clarify this, why are you saying we must authorise payment to proposed owners and not to current owners?  And then if they gave you an explanation which you thought was valid, it is one thing, if they did not give you an explanation that was satisfactory, you may have refused and said well, I am only prepared to authorise payment to current owners, so this would have to be changed.  Do you understand that?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Mr Seleka?     Was the management – did the board or anybody on the board ever ask management what was so urgent about this, why was it not brought to the board earlier?     But what is the answer to my question, is it that members of the board did ask this question of the executive and if so, what answer did the executive give as to why they did not bring this issue to the board earlier?     Well, before you proceed, Mr Seleka.     I do not know whether the summary of facts which is on page 282 was going to deal with this but I am looking at 2.2, the executive summary and conclusion.  That point made in paragraph 2.2.1 does not tell the board     Yes.  Well, Mr Seleka, you might know whether this issue of the level of urgency is dealt with as well in the executive summary.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Yes, you see, my – what I have an issue with in terms of what have said, is to the extent that you may be saying if management says it is urgent then I take it it is urgent.  I do not think that is correct, I think that as a board member you must satisfy yourself that it is indeed urgent.  So if management says this is urgent, you say why is it urgent?   They give you an explanation, if you are persuaded it is urgent that is fine especially if it is something in respect of which you would have liked to have more time to reflect like authorising payment of such a large amount of money, 1,6 billion.   So if they cannot satisfy that it is so urgent that it has got to be signed today, it can be signed in a week’s time, you might say well, you know, a few days will help me to make up my mind properly on the submission, so why are you saying we must meet today at whatever time.  You understand what I mean?  I do not think that just because management says it is urgent then board members must not question, they must take it it must be urgent.  You understand that?     Ja.     Yes.     Ja.     Okay, alright.     Of course, of course he did not tell you the level of urgency, did he?  He did not say if it s not done within – if it is not done today this is what is going to happen tomorrow or in a week’s time or anything like that, he did not tell you that.     Okay, thank you.  Mr Seleka?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     And this was on the 9 December.     Ja.     Yes, I mean, another day – if members of the board wanted another day to reflect properly would not have made a big difference.  Okay, alright. Mr Seleka?     Before you do that, is the position not that – and I am asking you, Mr Seleka, not the witness because the witness might not know.       Is the position not that around about exactly the time when the board was asked to authorise this pre-purchase agreement, to authorise prepayment to Tegeta, namely they met on the 9 December 2015, is that no – was that not the gate on which Mr Mosebenzi Zwane, who was then Minister of Mineral Resources, was having a meeting in Switzerland with the Chief Executive of Glencore where it would appear he facilitated the conclusion of a deal between Glencore and Tegeta/Oakbay?     The meeting was on the 1 December?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Between Tegeta and Glencore.     And Mr Tony Gupta was to attend that meeting.     You see, my recollection is that on the day on which Mr Mosebenzi Zwane met with the Chief Executive of Glencore in Switzerland…     And you say that was on the 1 December 15.     In that meeting there were three of them, Mr Mosebenzi Zwane, Mr Salim Essa and the Chief Executive of Glencore.     Yes, Mr Glasenberg.   And it is that meeting that Mr Glasenberg says in an affidavit Mr Salim Essa was introduced to him as an adviser to Minister Zwane.     And then, if I recall correctly, an arrangement was made – I do not know whether in that meeting but an arrangement was made for Mr Tony Gupta to meet with Mr Glasenberg, I do not know who else, I do not know whether the following day or on the 10 t h or whatever.     Yes.  So but it is all happening, you know, in the first half of December 2015.     Yes.  Okay, alright.     After the board had just authorised.     Ja, then the signing happens.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     So the agreement concluded between Tegeta and Glencore has a suspensive clause that says until 31 March 2016.     And the guarantee that is issued on the  December back in South Africa also has a suspensive clause that shares the same date.     Yes.     Ja.     H’m, ja.     Yes.     Oh yes that is the other meeting which ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes, yes.     And was that the Board or the BTC?     And nobody in the BTC says why are you rushing us to a meeting on the 11 t h when we have a meeting scheduled for the 13 t h, in two days time?     Yes, yes, yes.     Ja, ja.     Okay, alright, you follow the discussion Ms Klein?     [laughing].   Yes, continue Mr Seleka.     He will ask it again.     Speak up a little bit Mr Seleka.       Oh, okay, you heard that Mr Seleka?     I saw that in her second affidavit she deals with a matter that I am not sure she has dealt with in oral evidence, am I wrong about that?   It is about the matter that and the suspension letters that she got from Mr Khoza which it looks like there has been a ...[indistinct].     Oh, did she cover that last time?     Okay, what you haven’t done I guess is to get the expert who did the analysis to come and testify.     Yes, I think you should work on that, because they have got the report already, it shouldn’t be – it shouldn’t take long for them to be available.     Ja, so I think that is important that an expert gives evidence who conducted the analysis and is able to justify the conclusions that they reached with regard to saying that the letters of suspension seem to have been dealt with or dealt with ...[indistinct] by Suzanne Daniels as well as Mr Salim Essa.     That’s what they seemed to have had those letters – so that is important, I think that should be given some priority.     Thank you very much Ms Klein, we ...[intervenes]      He doesn’t want me to release you.   Yes Mr Seleka?     Which one is that?     Didn’t we admit all of them, three or two?     This bundle?     Oh it’s – oh.     Yes well we can – well if you want to add it to this bundle at the end that might be convenient.     Have you got the original or copy?     Have you got copies or you don’t have copies?     Oh, okay.     Let me have the original.  Do you want to briefly say what it deals with in terms of the gist or is it quite involved?        I thought you said it is an affidavit, I see correspondence here.        Ja, but this one while she may have intended it as a statement I think there is a letter addressed to the Chairperson and then there is a statement, she has signed it, what you can you do is get her to confirm its contents are true and correct under oath then we – do we need the first page, the correspondence?   Oh it starts one, two and then three.     Well it looks like we must just take it as it is, this one, there are two, oh this is an annexure to the statement.     Oh but now why did you staple them separately or you had a small stapler that couldn’t ... [laughing] you see I think it should only come in here when it is properly ...[intervenes]      But what you can do is get her to confirm it under oath.     Get her to confirm it under oath while she is here.     Ja, I think do that and then maybe tomorrow morning when it is properly stapled and you can then ask that I admit it as an exhibit and you add it at the end of this.     Of this bundle.     Okay just go ahead then.     Yes.     Thank you very much Ms Klein, you are now excused, thank you.     Thank you.     We can take a short adjournment while you reorganise and then – will ten minutes be enough?     Okay, alright.  What was your estimate of how long you might be with her? ADV SELEKA     Yes, okay, alright.     Well I think you took shorter with Ms Klein than you had estimated, I am going to assume that it is going to be the same with her, but obviously as I always say in the end the issues must be dealt with.     Properly, but at the same time there is no need to take longer than one should.     Okay, we will adjourn for ten minutes.  We adjourn.     Okay Mr Seleka.    Are you ready?    Yes.  If – you may do so from where you are if you – I think you voice is quite audible yes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  Alright.    Please administer the oath or affirmation.  I am sorry, I am sorry.  I am going to start afresh.  Ms Naidoo you are speaking very softly so just speak up a little bit    Okay please start afresh.    Thank you; you may proceed Mr Seleka.  You may keep your microphone on Ms Naidoo.  Ja.    Okay the actual affidavit starts at page 269.2 is that right?    The affidavit of Devapushpum Naidoo I hope I pronounced that name correctly starting at page 269.2 is admitted as Exhibit U29.1.  Was that pronunciation of your name correct Ms Naidoo?    Was my pronunciation of your first name correct?    Viroshni.    Okay alright.  Okay.    Just repeat the page?    Okay I have got it.    The affidavit of Ms Viroshni Naidoo starting at page 268 that is a supplementary affidavit starting at page 23 – 269.238 is admitted as Exhibit U29.2.    Okay. ADV SELEKA    Hang on.  Let us get there.  What is the page for the main affidavit?  I see where it ends.    Ja okay.    I am sorry 1995 should be?    Oh okay.    1994 should read?    1990?    1996?    Ja.      Okay.    Where is that now the second – the next line?    1995 should be 1997?    I am sorry, I am sorry let us get to the page first.      Use the…    Use the pagination on the top left of the page to tell us which page we should go to.    So what is the correction that should be made there?    You will have to do a supplementary affidavit that will …    Contain all these corrections.  We are just making notes.    But you need to – your Counsel will or your Counsel will assist you to do a supplementary affidavit which points out the corrections that you have pointed out.    But have you pointed out all of them now?    Okay alright.    Do you not – do you want to spend time on that Mr Seleka?    Hang on one second.  Ms Naidoo I think you are quite fast.      You speak quite fast and you speak quite soon after or just before he finishes.  Okay what is an error on page 269.60 I seem to have understood that there was something – something you were saying was an error.    On page 269.60.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay Ms Naidoo I am sorry you will have to repeat that.    I do not know whether there is something wrong with your microphone or with your voice or both but…    Or it is how fast you are when you speak.  Ja well – the question was how come    You did not mention Albertime Pty Ltd in your affidavit.  Now what is the answer?    Well – well maybe the – maybe the first point is not finalised.  What is it in that question that would have made you not to include Albertime?    Yes okay no I thought you said there may have been something in – how the question from the commission was formulated and it is about your role so I was trying to understand.    Hm.    Hm.  Ms Seleka – Mr Seleka.    I am sorry Ms…      Ms Naidoo.  What is the article that you are talking about now?    Oh okay.    From where?    Okay.     How well did you – did you know him?    Ja.    Hm okay.    I am sorry.  Just repeat the sentence before this last one?    Is that not strange?    Generally ask between couples?    If you want to change from one job to – from working from one company for example to working for another company would you not talk to your partner, spouse and say this is what I am thinking?     What do you think? It might have an impact on certain matters in the family.  You might be coming back late because it is far in terms of the norms or that is the type of company that you are going to work for.  Obviously, in the end you decide.     But one, I would have thought that couples would talk about those things.     H’m.     Oh, so you would tell him after you had been appointed?     H’m.  Oh, no, no.  I understand.  The suggestion is not that you ask for permission but it is just that discussion and consideration.     Okay.  Mr Seleka.     Is this Brian Molefe?     Yes.     He had been there for about three days or what?     But at the meeting that you talk about when you he answered most of the questions.     Did you manage to go there or...? [Parties intervening each other – unclear] ADV SELEKA     Ja.  Ja, okay.     I take it you are just going there for the names of ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Ja, this is what happens when you lead the lawyer.  [laughs]     [laughs]     [laughs]     Okay.  Take it easy Ms Naidoo.  [laughs]     I am sorry Mr Seleka.     Ms Naidoo, that second sentence in     Ja.  It had not...  Ja, but there was a current agreement, is it not?   So what did you mean until an agreement was concluded?     You say    Yes.     Ja-no, that is what I am talking about.     To say, did you mean a new agreement?     No, no, no.     It is the meaning of what you say.     That ...[intervenes]      Because if you are – if there is a current agreement ...[intervenes]      ...and you are receiving a coal supply in terms of that document Eskom would continue receiving coal supply until an agreement was concluded …[intervenes]     Does not make sense.     Ja.     Okay, so your supplementary will also …[intervenes]    ...need to deal with that.  Yes, Mr Seleka?     Hang on, do say no so that that goes into the record.  When you shake your head it will go into the record.     We will ask Mr Roux to intervene. MS     Mr Seleka, do not forgot what you wanted to say.     But I think that some of the board members have said they believe that the suspensions were justified because there was to be an inquiry  I think some – I do not know if some might not have gone along with that, but where I do recall quite clearly is that many, if not all the board members who have testified here, have struggled to explain the exit of the three executives that have been suspended and I think the retention of one, Mr Koko.  So I just thought I do not want any member of the board who has testified to say you made a sweeping statement that they all could not explain the suspensions.     What of course you can say – there is nothing wrong if you say they have given explanations that in your view are not sustainable if that is what you think.     I just wanted to be careful that we do not say they have not been able to explain suspensions when at least some of them have said well, we thought that in terms of the fact that there was going to be this inquiry, we thought that it was an acceptable reason for the executives who headed those portfolios, that they should be suspended pending the finalisation of the inquiry.     Of course whether or not that is ...     Sustainable reason, is another matter.     I am sorry, Ms Naidoo, what is the point you want to make about the reservation of the right? MS     It was?     Please look this side.     Ja, okay.  What was wrong with a proposal that Eskom should reserve to itself the right to extend?     What was your understanding of what …[intervenes]     Hang on, hang on, hang on.  What was your understanding of what would go with the reservation of that right, you reserve the right and then what?     Was that the right to extend the contract?     Right, was there a condition attached to that or anything?     To that reservation of the right?     The thing is normally if you reserve a right, on the face of it that is in your favour …[intervenes]     Because you can decide to us it or you can decide not to use it in the future.     So unless you say there was something else linked to the reservation of the right that would prejudice Eskom in some way and that is what I want to understand.     What did it say?     What was your understanding of what he said.     If you reserve your right as Eskom.     Right?     Well, I am not sure of how much importance this particular point might be, Mr Seleka, we might not need to spend much time on it.     Ja. ADV SELEKA     We can move on, ja.     Ja, well you probably heard what I said to Ms Klein and maybe to Dr Naidoo in the morning as well that – well, what is troubling me about it …[intervenes]     What troubles me more in regard to you, because you are a lawyer.     But I think Ms Klein is a chartered accountant, there would be very – I think the two of you would be more of less the same in terms of – surprisingly.  I mean, that part which – of the submission that requested the board to authorise is a very important point.     Because before you come to the meeting or to discuss this by way of – or look at this by way of a round robin, you would know that the management is asking the board for an authorisation of something, number one. Number two, an authorisation for prepayment.  So obviously if you are being approached as a board to authorise something, you know there are very important pertinent questions, what must I authorise?  Why must I authorise it.  How is authorising it in the interests of Eskom?  If it is a payment obviously you want to know to whom?  Are they entitled it?  Are there grounds that they should be – we should authorise payment to that particular entity.  Those questions are pertinent questions that should arise in your mind and when you read the submission you are looking for answers to those questions.  So I certainly would have expected that you would pick that up.  Dr Naidoo said he did see but he did not – I think the effect of his evidence may well be that he did not think that – he did not appreciate its significance, I am not sure, I do not want misrepresent what he said, but he said he saw that the paragraph 2.1.2 of the submission refers to the agreement for prepayment being concluded with the proposed owners of OCM. Ms Klein did not say she did not see it, I think she said she probably saw it.  I think she could not remember but she did not say I did not see it, she said I probably saw it and it may well be that – I think she said that the focus for her was on the fact that OCM was in a business rescue situation and then they wanted to secure the supply of coal.   Dr Ngubane was here, I am not sure whether we asked him how he could have missed it but he said also as far as he was concerned he intended – he was authorising a prepayment to go to OCM under Glencore, not Tegeta.  So you have a professor, Prof Naidoo, you have a chartered accountant, you have a medical doctor, Dr Ngubane, you have an attorney, they all – some maybe se this, these two words, proposed owners, but do not attach to them the significance they should attach to them.  Maybe others do not see them.  So it is – and yet you are dealing with a very large amount.  I think Ms Klein may have suggested indirectly that in the context of Eskom maybe R1,6 billion is not so large and amount, you know, but I think most people will agree that it is a large amount that you are dealing with.  The larger the amount you are being asked to authorise, the greater the duty on you to double-check that this money will go to the right entity, the right person.  You do not want to authorise money that should go to A, you authorise it to go to B.  You understand?     So that is part of what is troubling me, how it is possible that in a board of – I think I was told about 12.     And that is apart from the investment and finance committee.  Of course their members would be members of the board as well.     But it would mean that they got two chances of looking at the same thing, firstly at the level of the committee and secondly at the level of the board and nobody said hang on, hang on, hang on, we are being asked here to authorise a prepayment to proposed owners, not current owners, why is that?  What is going on?     I think come closer to the mic.     Except that it is remarkable to say the least.     Hang on, hang on.  You accept that it is quite remarkable that from the entire Board does not look like anybody's says anything about there is something that needs clarification here, on the point of who is going to benefit, who are we authorising payment to pre-payment to?     How is it possible so many people, highly…[intervene]     Hang on, hang on Ms Naidoo, highly qualified people and I think some of them quite experienced.     But even that urgency they did not question did they?     That issue could have waited even another week from what I can see.  So why did they not say hang on, we need more time, this thing can wait.  Why do you rush us to make a decision on this, they did not do that.  They do not – it is in black and white, it is in front of them. all of them do not say hang on what is going on here?      But you were the Board, you were for all intents and purposes the ultimate authority at Eskom. Nobody should rush you to making decisions, where you are not satisfied that there is reason to make a decision now, now, now.     If you need more time, you can get more time.     But who tells the Board?     But because you are not asking questions. You are not saying to them, what is going to happen if we only decide this in a week?  You do not ask those questions.      Well, this, this submission that you authorised says proposed owners of OCM, it does not say current owners of OCM.     But that does not justify this failure on the part of this Board to appreciate that they were being asked to authorise payment to proposed owners as opposed to current owners.  It was there in front of them, it was black and white.  You cannot blame management and say they did not tell you that they were asking you to authorise pre-payment to Tegeta.     But in a clause that his entitled or she is entitled whoever it was, is entitled to expect you to look at because it is about what you are asked to do.      Yes, okay alright.  Mr Seleka.     Mr Seleka I think you have a question, so I will hold back.  I thought you might want to follow up on that answer.  Okay, no, that is fine.     How would you know if the Board was facilitating this deal if they did not say so in the meeting?  You say the Board did not do that.     Ja, you speak for yourself, ja     Ja.     But the only way we are going to find out about everybody is to ask everyone.  Nobody's asked me for four years, what I did.  I did not know about the so called correspondence that was happening between all these parties.  I found out about it three weeks before - a few weeks ago.  So it is - I find it very hard to accuse people of things when there is evidence out there and people are just ignoring it.      Well you see Ms Naidoo and you may have heard me say this in the past if you listened or watched when some of the members of the Board or other former members of the Board of Eskom officials who had testified.  There is something that seems to suggest that at least some of the members of this Board, this Eskom Board may have been working in cahoots with people who were outside of Eskom, or may have known of some agenda on the part of people who were outside of Eskom and who were allowing themselves to advance that agenda, and it may be that some members of the Board didn’t know about those agendas but may have dealt with certain decisions of them having – certain decisions which enabled an agenda, or some agenda that belonged to people who were outside of Eskom. So some might have known what was going on and others might have been going on with what they believed was their normal duty.        Not now.   You have this situation Mr Seleka pointed out to you, in 2014 Mr Salim Essa, according to Mr Johan Bester – is it Johan Bester?     Hank Bester who gave evidence here, in 14 already tells Mr Hank Bester that the next boss for Eskom will be Mr Brian Molefe.  At that time Mr Brian Molefe is Group CEO at Transnet and he has not applied for any job at Eskom and somebody is appointed as Group CEO of Eskom, that is Mr Matona, I think at the end of – at the beginning of October.     1 October 2014, before that he was DG of the Department of Mineral Resources if I recall correctly.     Oh, at DPE ja, but he was DG.     Ja, at DPE, so he is familiar with Eskom also.  So within a few months while he was still trying to present his turnaround plan for Eskom he is suspended together with other executives under circumstances that raise questions and he goes to the Labour Court, tries to fight to come back and according to him he is told by one of the members of the Board that going back to Eskom is out of the question for him, they can talk about money but not going back. The executives concerned as suspended they get – it is said that they have done nothing wrong and a lot those executives you know said we were pushed out and they are given a lot of money and I asked Board members who have testified here why did you give them such a lot of money to leave if as far as you were concerned they could still come back, you had no problem with them.  They couldn’t give me any satisfactory explanation.    And then of course on the 17 t h of April 2015 Minister Brown announces, as a media conference, announces that Mr Brian Molefe will be seconded to Eskom as Acting Group CEO.   I think Mr Molefe is hardly three months there, or two months/three months, then according I think one witness or some affidavit I may have read he then recommends to the Eskom Board that Mr Anoj Singh who was at Transnet as the CFO must also be brought to Eskom, and there is a huge question as to how Ms Molefe, Tsholofelo Molefe, who was Financial Director in March 15 at Eskom, therefore CFO of Eskom, how she got to be included in the list of executives to be suspended because at the meeting of the 8 t h of March 2015 at Mr Zuma’s official residence in Durban where the issue of the suspension of the Eskom executives was discussed and Mr Zuma is said to have been there as well in the discussion, Ms Tsholofelo or her portfolio was not included, and then Ms Daniels and Mr – what is the name Abraham, Masago, say that on the 10 t h of March, one day before the day on which the Board suspended these executives they both say separately they were called by Mr Koko to a meeting at Melrose Arch where they met with Mr Koko and Mr Salim Essa, separate meetings, and they were told the names of the executives who were going to be suspended and for the first time Ms Molefe’s name was included and when the Minister – Minister Brown, arrived and came to speak to t he Board on the morning of the 11 t h, she also – when she spoke about the suspensions, she included Ms Molefe in terms of her portfolio, she had not been included in the original, and then she when there were discussions for her to leave between members of the Board who were mandated by the Board to talk to her, the Board had given a mandate through those Board members who were talking to these executives that in terms of money it should be I think 12 months, 12 months remuneration, not more than that, she was not prepared to take that, she resisted leaving, but instead of them saying okay come back because after all they were not saying she had done anything wrong, they increased the offer to her I think to 1.8.     To 18 months, ja, not 1.8, 18 months’ salary and you ask the question but why, why did you have to pay so much if you had no problem with these executives coming back, and it becomes difficult not to say well could it be that this whole thing was planned, that Mr Molefe should be brought to Eskom and maybe Mr Anoj Singh should be brought to Eskom as well, but of course they couldn’t be brought there if there were people in those positions, those people needed to leave and then you go back to Mr Hank Bester ’s evidence that already in 2014 Mr Salim Essa told him that you will see how powerful we are, Mr Brian Molefe is going to be the next boss of Eskom. So – and then you think about emails, evidence that has been led here, emails that seems to come from people outside of Eskom and outside of government, sending messages, sending emails to Eskom including an email that went to Dr Ngubane who was Chairperson of the Eskom Board, which was in effect dictating to the Board what decision they should take about certain newspapers which had published certain articles about Eskom and Transnet, I can’t remember who else, and Dr Ngubane has confirmed here that he took that email and went through to the Board and the Board made exactly those decisions. So I am just saying when you say the Board did not intend to facilitate anything for – about the deal of Tegeta and Eskom, it may well be that some members of the Board knew of some agenda.     Yes.     You see part of the reason why I am telling you what I am telling you is exactly to be fair to you, to say this is what is going on in my mind, what can you tell me, you see that is part of being fair to members of the Board, to say I am not hiding from you what is going on in my mind, I want you to influence my thinking, this is what I am thinking.     It is not final.     Yes.     Ja, no, no, no that is fine.  Mr Seleka we are at quarter to six.   Let us talk about how long we – you still need to be and we might need to take a short adjournment.   I am not necessarily saying finish now, I just want that we all have an idea of how much longer you will still need.     I can still sit longer, I just want to have an idea.     Yes especially some of the matters which have been dealt with you know there might not be a need to go all over through them again but at the same time in terms of fairness it is important to give Ms Naidoo a chance to say something, but on some of the matters I guess I mean she could even finish a response on certain points even by way of affidavits, but while we are here, if we can, let’s use the time as much as possible. So we have to do justice to the issues even with whatever time constraints.     Ja, so what is your assessment?     No, I don’t think we should stop now.      Yes, let us check with you first then we check with your counsel, are you fine?     Okay Mr Roux?     You are fine with that, okay, no, no that is fine, let’s take a ten minutes adjournment now.     And then we come back and then we continue and try and see if we are able to finish by half past six.     Oh, okay, no, no I think let’s take a break, the witness might wish a break.     Okay we will take a ten minutes break, we will bear in mind what you said, yes. We adjourn.     Okay let us continue.    Ja okay.  Can I just interpose to complete an issue we discussed earlier on which should have been discussed I was mentioning because I do not want to forget.  Please do not forget your next question.    Were you present or do you recall the meeting that I was talking about earlier where Dr Ngubane as I understand his evidence asked the board to consider making – taking the resolutions that were set out in some letter or memo that had come from outside of Eskom?    That was in relation to the Mail and Guardian, City Press.    I do not know which other paper yes.    Do you recall that?    Yes, no, no.    Do not – do not into the contents of the articles.    Ja.  I just want to – so you were present – you attended that meeting?    Where the resolution was taken?    Oh that is what I am interested in.    Oh okay but you – you had…    Yes okay thank you.    Yes.    But are you saying that you did not take part in that Round Robin?    Oh okay.    Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.    Ja he said so ja.    Mr Seleka.    Are you coming to the realisation that indeed maybe there is truth in the suggestion that this board of Eskom or at least maybe some members of it may have been party to some agenda by people who were outside of Eskom and influencing what decisions were being taken inside Eskom both by the board and by officials?    Yes.    Look – look – have you looked at the resolution in the minutes of the board?    The resolution of – that was passed by the board at the meeting where – is it on the 9 t h of December?    On the 9t h of December 2015 with regard to the pre-payment.  Have you looked at those minutes?    Have you looked the resolution is at the end of the minutes.  Have you looked at them?    Yes.  They – that resolution is quite clear.  It quotes verbatim clause or paragraph 2.1.2 that we talked about earlier which had proposed owners.    Sorry.    Well I do not – I cannot remember whether it is signed but that is what it says and it is not – it is not surprising because that is what has been – been the – the Executives had asked the board to authorise and what seems to have been done is to take that out from the submission and put it in the resolution.  As – were the minutes signed that we are talking about?    Yes.    Yes but there may be signed ones I do not know but there would have been I would imagine after a meeting there would circulate minutes the time to sign might be another time but at some stage they would be circulated, would they not?  And I would imagine if they did not circulate them the secretary – company secretary, members of the board would want – would demand that they be circulated so that they see whether what they decided is correctly captured in the minutes and the resolution.    That is the committee?    I am talking about the board.    Yes.    Yes but the board you were part of the meeting of the board and the resolution might not be – the minutes might not be signed but they reflect basically what was in paragraph 2.1.2 which you had seen.     And they are quite – they are quite clear.  That paragraph was clear – that one you – you …    In terms of what they were asked all you can say or some members of the board may say is I never intended to authorise pre-payment to the proposed owners of  OCM and then we can talk about how probable that is but in terms of what you intended that is one line.    But in terms of what you objectively authorised that is what you authorised.    But – but you do not dispute that the document that was placed before you the submission or the executive summary asked you to authorise pre-pay – a pre-payment to Tegeta.  You – you say you did not see that other members say or one member says he saw it but did not appreciate its significance because he knew that the existing contract was with OCM Glencore and so – so I am suggesting to you that if there are any – if there are existing minutes that are signed in all probability they will be along the lines of paragraph 2.1.2.    But I do not know if the record …    Hm.    Oh by the way it was a Round Robin.    Yes okay but the fact of the matter is – but in the Round Robin.    Where is the document that has – is it – where is the document that they were – the resolution that they were asked to sign – to approve?    If it is the submission then you autho – you authorised pre-payment.    Pre-payment to OCM – to Tegeta then.    Hm.    No.  No.  No Ms Naidoo you know that what you are saying is – cannot be right I mean you cannot have a lower body – the minutes of a lower body overriding the minutes of a higher body.  The higher body makes the final decision.    And it is clear from that submission.    But Dr Naidoo was here and he was chairing that meeting.    You heard – you heard what he said.    He could not – he could not defend the proposition as – that was my assessment – this as  - the proposition that they authorised anything other than pre-payment to Tegeta but what he did say was in his mind and in the mind of the committee that is what he said they thought they were authorising pre-payment to Glencore OCM but the questions that I have asked you know and he kept on advancing as his reasons to justify his evidence that they intended to authorise pre-payment to Glencore OCM.  The reason he kept on advancing is a reason that actually goes against him.    Hm.    If I recall correctly we looked at them in the morning to say the favourable interpretation of those minutes favourable to you would be that it could go either way.    No, no, no have you looked at those minutes?  When did you last look at them?    Just draw his attention – her attention to them.    At least what we looked at in the morning seemed to me to say the least that it was neutral.    Well you see OCM – OCM does not have.    Saying OCM does not have because for the owners of OCM before Tegeta came into the picture was Glencore.  The owners as I understand it of OCM after Glencore got out of the picture were Tegeta.  So if you say pre-payment to OCM it does not necessarily mean you mean Glencore or you mean Tegeta.  But when you say pre-payment to the proposed owners of OCM it is clear that you are not talking about Glencore you are talking about Tegeta.    Well – ja but that is the point we are talking about to say that does not help you either way that is why I am saying to say the least that could be neutral because OCM – is it OCM under Tegeta or OCM under Glencore?  The submission that was placed before the board talked about OCM the proposed owners of OCM.     No, no, no.  Otherwise, the submission would not say proposed owners.       Mr Seleka.     I think I might not need to see if you just read.     Ja.  Because we looked at them in the morning.     So it still says in the submission?     But what is in the submission?     Proposed owners.     So you cannot say when the resolution makes the basis of your decision, the submission, incorporates it and the submission is quite clear.  It does not look like to me you can ...[intervenes]      ...run away.  It does not seem that you can run away from saying ...[intervenes]      [laughs] I think you might wish to leave that to Mr Roux.  [laughs]     Yes, okay continue.     Ja.     I see I have just gone past half-past five – half-past six.     Finalise.     Wait.  We are at quarter to Mr Seleka.     I am just alerting you to the time.     Obviously, Ms Naidoo should come back.     [laughs]     Well, in regard to the supplementary affidavit, also to finalise.     Because she is going to come back.     Then to finalise some of these issues.  But I see from her affidavit that there may be some issues in relations – there may be some issues on her version in relation to the meetings of the 11 t h of March.     And the suspensions and so on.  I think certain things need to be raised with her.     So I think let us stop here for now and we will just have to find another – probably in the evening again.  If Mr Roux, if we are looking at a date within two weeks, we will ...[intervenes]      You...  Okay no that is fine.  That is fine.  So let us leave it at that for now.  Thank you to everybody for being able to work until this time.  We will find another date.     Hopefully within the next two weeks.     And make it an evening session.  Okay.     Tomorrow, who are your witnesses?     Ja.     Okay.     Ja. Okay.  No, that is fine.  Alright. We are going to adjourn.  Or we should start early if possible tomorrow, is it not? ADV SELEKA     We should be able to ...[intervenes]      Okay.  You think he might be how long?     About three hours?     Oh, so we might not be able to get to Ms Daniels tomorrow.     Oh, I thought Mr Pamensky was going to be much shorter from what you have said before.     Oh.  It could implicate other people?     Ja.  So maybe we should rather start, at least, at half-past nine.     Because remember I am not sitting for the whole day tomorrow.     Ja.  I am sitting only for half of the day.     Okay alright.  We start at half-past nine tomorrow.  Okay we are going to adjourn for the day.  We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Chairperson we have Dr Naidoo Pat Naidoo who will be the first witness today.  Dr Pat Naidoo is ready to take the oath or affirmation Chairperson.    The microphone is off.    Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson Mr Naidoo will testify mainly on the transactions eish and will give the Chairperson a background in regard to his appointment on the board and the transaction is mainly the R1.6 billion submission that was made to the board in December 2015.      Thank you.  Dr Naidoo thank you for assisting the commission.    Chairperson we will use Bundle – Eskom Bundle 16 Exhibit U36.    You have it as well Dr Naidoo?  Dr Naidoo has provided the commission with three affidavits Chairperson.    The first of which is found on page 3 of the Eskom Bundle 16.  Dr Naidoo we follow the black pagination on the left hand corner – top left hand corner.    Yes.  So that is the first one Chairperson.    And I – once I have identified them Chair I will then ask leave to have them admitted.    I will take them one by one. Dr Naidoo on page 3 I think you are now on page 4.    Go back.  Just go back.  Ja.      Is that page 3?    The – no.  Right at the top.    Ja the left.    The black pagination.    That is right.    Yes.      Forget for a moment the 003.    Just concentrate on the number 3.    So that is the one affidavit of Pathmanathan Naidoo that affidavit goes until page 27 Dr Naidoo.    And there is a signature there by the deponent.    Is that your signature?    On the 30 t h November 2020 the date is right next to the signature.  Go back to the signature page which is page 27.    You confirm that?    Thank you Dr Naidoo.  Chairperson I will beg leave to have this affidavit admitted as Exhibit U36.1.    36.1    Thank you.  Then Dr Naidoo on page 28.    There is another affidavit it runs up to page 47.    You see the signature there; you confirm that to be your signature?    The affidavit dated 6 October 2020.    Thank you.  Chairperson I beg leave to have this affidavit admitted as Exhibit U36.2.    Thank you Chair.  Lastly Dr Naidoo the affidavit on page 47.1.    You see that?    That affidavit ends on page 47.22.    You confirm the signature there to be yours?    The affidavit is dated 7 September .    You confirm the contents thereof.    Thank you.      Chairperson I beg leave to have it admitted as Exhibit U36.3.    Thank you Chair.   Dr Naidoo the issues of suspensions have been extensively traversed before the commission.  What we would like you to focus on if really on the issues of transactions which is the pre-payments decisions that were made by the board relative to either OCM Optimum or relative to Tegeta.    Yes.  So just by way of introduction we have seen from your affidavit that you confirm your appointment of the board of Eskom in December 2014.    Yes.  That – could you tell the Chairperson whether that was your first service on the board of Eskom?  Were you – was that your first appointment to serve on the board of Eskom?    And when as you speak yes face to the Chairperson.  Had you sat on any other board before that?    Thank you Dr Naidoo.  Dr Naidoo did you have any relations or interactions with your board members – any of your board members prior to your appointment on the Eskom board?    No one.      With Mr Salim Essa?    You do not even know him.  With any of the Gupta brothers?    Thank you.  Did you have any interaction with him during your appointment – I mean during your service on the Eskom Board.    Any prior interaction or relations with Minister Lynn Brown?    With the former President Jacob Zuma?    Thank you.    Let me just give you a sequence of how I would like you to lead your evidence.  There is what has been referred to as the Cooperation Agreement concluded between Eskom and OCM in 14 with the Fourth Addendum paving the way through emending their agreement between the two entities.   That is on the one hand.  On the other then it will be the submission that is made in December 15 regarding a pre-payment decision. Let us start with the Cooperation Agreement because the Cooperation Agreement as you would recall it was an endeavour between Eskom and OCM to revise the terms of their agreement an existing. That Cooperation Agreement came to the BTC on the 15 t h of April 2015.  The BTC did not decide it; it referred the matter to the board. Were you a member of the BTC at the time – April 15?    You were not?    The matter then came to the board on the 23 r d of April 2015.  You recall that?  You recall that?    Yes.  The board too did not decide the matter and I would like you to briefly tell the Chairperson why did the board not decide the matter and what it did – what did the board instead do with the matter in the meeting of the 23 r d of April 2015.    Thank you Chair.  Dr – Dr Naidoo so you saying that hardship experienced by OCM and the request by OCM for an increase in the purchase price would have set the ground work for the pre-payment?     Well, I want to make sure I understand what you have just said because I want to understand whether it amounts to saying we would not comply with the arbitrators award if he or she found in favour of OCM or whether it says we would comply.  We would just need to make certain arrangements in order to handle the situation.     Yes.  Dr Naidoo, let us go back to the meeting of the 21 s t.  So the Coal Operation Agreement is before the board and the terms you are proposing in terms of the 4 t h Agenda.  Just tell the Chair how the board dealt with that matter.     Yes.     It was transferred to ...[intervenes]      To the Chief – the new Chief Executive.     Yes.  That was Mr Brian Molefe.     Yes.  So this is a meeting on the 23 r d of April.  It is at the same meeting that the board approves the secondment of Mr Molefe.      To be with effect from the 20 t h of April.     So he is new at Eskom.     Ja.  Is there a reason why the matter was not referred to the team, back to the team that was negotiating the transaction?     Ja.     H’m.     So we have seen from various affidavits of board members who are yet to testify including yourselves, that there was an expectation that Mr Molefe will come back to the board on that issues.     But he would report back.     H’m.  The question was then asked which you addressed in your affidavit, whether were you aware as the board...  Well, let me ask you whether – did Mr Molefe come back to the board?  You have any recollection of him coming back to the board?     Thank you.  Let me ask you this then.  We have seen from the evidence that he terminated the negotiation and corporate agreement with OCM.  Was the board aware of that termination?     Prior to it happening, you were not aware?     Yes.  Now, so there is – the parties are trying to negotiate a new agreement, a new term, increase the price.  The matter is given to Mr Molefe who has just arrived at Eskom.  He ultimately terminates that process in July 2015.  You are saying the board is not aware of it.  Can you recall when the board does become aware of it or you personally?     If you cannot recall, you cannot recall.     Okay.  Okay Chair that – Chairperson, that accelerates the matter.  So let us go into that.     Dr Naidoo, let us go into that.     So the termination is made of the negotiation process between the two parties, Eskom and OCM.  In December 2015, the 8 t h of December 2015, the board gets an email from Ms Suzanne Daniels.     About the request for the board to consider a submission for a prepayment of R 1.6 billion.     Now that submission and that is where you are.     Tell the Chairperson what you understood the submission to request the prepayment to be made?       Yes.     Yes, thank you.  Thank you for clearing that out.  So Dr Naidoo, your understanding was that OCM, which is one owned by Glencore, was – there was going to be this prepayment.     The relationship has – the soured relationship is now revitalised.     And we are going to assist OCM, come out of business rescue, safe jobs, supply ...[intervenes]      ...Hendrina supply and Arnot.     And so on.  So that is the IFC.     Chairperson, just by way of reference.  Dr Naidoo, maybe you should go to Eskom Bundle 18 because that note you are referring to is to be found in 18(A).     Bracket A.     Ja, ja.     Yes.  It is 18(A) Chairperson, page ...[intervenes]      It is page two...  It starts at page 281.  Just...     Page 281.       You have got it?  Okay.  Ja, stay on 281.     Ja. Because I want to refer you to 281 and 286.       And 286.     Yes.       You have?     Yes.     Yes.     So the Chairperson the document on page 286, Dr Naidoo as well, that is the submission that came before the board, also served before the IFC.  If you ...[intervenes]      Alright.  You have seen it.     Yes.  And the page ...[intervenes]      281 Chairperson.     He has just confirmed.     And it is the submission that served before the IFC and the board.     Ja.  Motivating for the prepayment.     Both.     Chair, 286 is a different document.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Okay.  He has confirmed the submission.  Let us go to his document.  Your document Dr Naidoo on 286.     Yes. Because you are explaining to the Chairperson ...[intervenes]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     That is right.     Yes.     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.     Dr Naidoo, you understand the question?     That the Chairperson...  Ja, you can simply just point out to the Chairperson what made you ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Oh.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     The board itself Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Oh, we will find it.     I will find it Chair.     I will find the page because Chair the board did not need – the board sent approvals by Round-robin.     Ja.     Yes.     Ja, thank you.  Ja, I will get the page reference of the Chairperson.     Chair, I found the page reference for the board resolution.     On the matter.  In the same bundle, Eskom bundle 18(A) page 352.22.     Yes.     Yes, those minutes.     Are on page 279.     Yes. I do have the signed minutes, Chairperson.     Because those ones are not signed.     They are further down on page 584.     Ja, it does say Optimum (Pty) Ltd.     No, it is the signed, Chair, so what Dr Naidoo was reading …[intervenes]     Ja, it is exactly, it is on page 584.     The resolution is the same, page 584.     So the minutes starts there at page 584, the resolution is on page 585.     But what Dr Naidoo wanted brought to your attention, Chair.     It said the resolution does read pre-purchase of coal from Optimum (Pty) Ltd.     Ja, except, Chair, a distinction might have to be made when you add (Pty) Ltd at the end because then it relates to the entity.     I beg your pardon?     Yes, it relates to the entity as opposed to the mine itself.     Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     The board.     That is page 352.22.     So it is by round robin, Chair, and the resolution, resolution required.  So what you – the Chairperson will see there,  is what was required from the board on the first page, page 352.22.  On the next page the – and I believe it is Ms Suzanne Daniels, would have populated the table to indicate which of the board members send their approvals.      Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that …[intervenes]     I think I have covered sufficient.  Dr Naidoo, the next question is about the guarantee because this pre-purchase was not made to either Glencore – oh well, in fact not OCM at all.  Do you know that?  Chair, let me gather my thoughts, we could adjourn, I can finish in five minutes.      Thank you, Chair.     Thank you.     Thank you, Chair.  Yes.     Yes, Dr Naidoo, we will finish off because – may I just – let us take it further because the – you have made, as the board, as IFC, made a decision for a prepayment.     And in your understanding it is a prepayment to OCM owned by Glencore to come out of business rescue, supply to Hendrina, also probably supply t Arnot and save jobs.     That decision is made on the 9 December 2015.  Did the board know what happened insofar as the execution of the decision was concerned?     Did you know that on the 10 t h, the next day, after you have made that prepayment decision, a guarantee was instead prepared?  Did you know that?     And that the guarantee was ultimately issued in favour of Tegeta on the 10 December?     You did not.  Did you ask the executives – we made a R1.6 billion decision the other day, what is the position, what is happening?     Ja, so – but did they give you the details of who was supplying coal?     No.  Okay.  There was another prepayment made in April 2016.  I know that you have not dealt with that in your affidavit but do you know anything about that prepayment of R659 million?     No.  It was made – it was a decision of the BTC.  Are you saying it did not come to the board?     It was not reported to the board.     Okay.  Chair that – well, I – you know, there was evidence here – and I do not know whether you will know, evidence by Ms Mosilo Mothepu on how McKinsey, Regiments were appointed at Eskom.     Would you have knowledge of meetings that are allegedly – were allegedly held with Mr Anoj Singh prior to him coming to Eskom?     You would not.  Okay, that concludes my questions for Dr Naidoo.  Dr Naidoo says he is a professor.     He says he is actually a professor.     Thank you, Chairperson, the next witness is going to be Ms Venete Klein and as per the arrangement yesterday and the request from her, she will testify via video link.     I think a five minute adjournment would be preferable, Chair.     A five minutes adjournment, yes.     Thank you. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you Ms Klein.  Chairperson we are going to use Eskom Bundle 2, and just before we go into it Ms Klein is testifying not for the first time before the Commission.  Last time when she appeared, we dealt with the issues of suspensions of the executives and we ended well, when we adjourned her testimony we were dealing with the removal of Mr Tsotsi and the reasons given by the Board for that removal or vote of no confidence. That matter has extensively been traversed Chairperson, we were from there going to go into the removal of Mr Norman Baloyi and that would have been the issues in regard to the suspension it would have covered those issues and what we would have been left with are the transactions, which is what we have been dealing with now.      So the bundle Chairperson is Eskom Bundle 2, Ms Klein has provided three affidavits so far, the third of those affidavits deals with the transactions.  The first affidavit Chair – well now the pagination Chairperson on my side because this is an old file. It has a red pagination, only the red pagination it has a red pagination, only the red pagination, yes.  It changes later on in the file to the black and the red.     No I can use the black because the main affidavit we would be dealing with on the transactions has the two paginations.  But what I wanted to do was I see the first affidavit does not seem to have been admitted as an exhibit to have them all three admitted and then go to where I need to be.     Correct.     That is the suspensions only.     It will be you U14.1.     Correct Chair.     She would have confirmed it on the first occasion when she appeared.     Ms Klein you follow?     As Exhibit U14.1, thank you Chair.      Thank you, Chairperson.      Correct.  The second affidavit is on page, black pagination 400.1, 400.1.  This one is new Chairperson.  Ms Klein are you there on page 401.1?      Yes, between ten lines, you see the words supplementary affidavit by Venete Klein?     Yes, and go to page 400.5.      Yes, your name appears…[intervene]     Yes, your name appears there Venete Jarlene Klein above that is a signature.  Do you confirm that to be your signature and the affidavit is dated…[intervene]     Can you see us on the screen?     Okay, so the affidavit is dated is it 18 or 15 January 2021, 18?     Yes, that is 18, do you confirm that to be your affidavit?     Chairperson I beg leave to have this affidavit admitted, as Exhibit U14.2.     Together with the annexures, thank you Chair.  That affidavit just by way of information deals with issues that arose during Ms Klein’s testimony.  So she has filed that supplementary affidavit in order to reduce those issues which were new to writing.  Then Ms Klein turn to page 400.43.      Thank you.     That is an affidavit that runs up to page 400.50.     Do you confirm at the bottom of - above your name there to be, your Signature?      The affidavit is dated 3 February 2021.     Do you confirm this to be your affidavit?     Chairperson I beg leave to the have it admitted as Exhibit U14.3.     Thank you, Chair.     Chairperson I could or we could show the extent is necessary on Mr Tsotsi’s issues.     Thank you Chair, Ms Klein just quickly on the aspect of suspensions we were dealing with the removal of Mr Tsotsi and there was the issue about Mr Tsotsi having failed to give a report which he had said was an investigation report available on the basis, and being a document on the basis of which the President wanted the inquiry to be conducted.  Do you recall that?     And the - those of you Board members who came to testify, placed some emphasis on his failure to produce the document in order for you to make the decision that was ultimately made.     And according to the testimony that we heard, that was one of the reasons why the Board took a decision that he should be charged.     But the way in which the charges are formulated, one could not find the charge relating to his failure to provide the Board with such a report.     Yes.  Let me take that further because you see some of - at least most of the Board members who have provided affidavits to the Commission, they have placed on or set out in their affidavits that when the Minister arrived on the 11 t h of March 2015, the Minister essentially repeated what Mr Tsotsi had said, at least insofar as the inquiry is concerned.  But the Minister went further and identified four areas which he said were of concern to her, and said that the executives in those areas should step aside while the inquiry is ongoing.  My question is, did the Board ask the Minister about the report prior to the Board having to take a decision?  The report allegedly, the Board wanted Mr Tsotsi to produce.      So if we accept your recollection that the report trans – the mention of the report was made only after the Minister had left.  Did you consider as the Board whether it was necessary to go back to the Minister and say, wait Minister before we implement what you have put to us should we not follow due process?  Should we not first obtain this report, which Mr Tsotsi has told us about and then see whether and how we implement what you have put to us?     Okay, finally on that, did the Board not itself render the report unnecessary?  If we recall Dr Ngubane when in response to Mr Norman Baloyi’s question     Thank you.  In regard to Mr Norman Baloyi who it seems was a troubled child for the Board from the very beginning.  Can you recall why the Board moved for his removal?     Thank you Chair, yes I recognise the disadvantage because you have not dealt with it in your affidavit. I am going to move on Ms Klein just by…[intervene]     Yes, insofar as the Board members are concerned, your fellow Board members, did you have any relations any interaction with them prior to your appointment on the Board, Eskom Board and the 11 t h of December 2014?     But you did not know him personally?     Any of the Gupta brothers?     Did you come to know them during your time serving on the Eskom Board at a personal level?     Mr Salim Essa?     Yes, what breakfast was this?     And you say in your affidavit it was during about March, April 2015?     So you did not know him before then?     Minister Lynn Brown?     So did you come to know her on a personal level?     Yes, and the former President Jacob Zuma prior to your appointment on the Board, did you know him personally?     Okay.  Now there is an issue I want to draw to your attention before we go into the transactions because it is relevant to what I have, what I am dealing with now.  And this is what Mr Koko says in his submission is an invitation you made to him to come to your home, to your house.  You know about that allegation?    If I could read to the Chairperson to put the Chairperson on the same page just before you respond to that allegation.    It is in Eskom Bundle 15 – Eskom Bundle 15(b) on page 10 – 1039.  Ms Klein I know I have provided you with this affidavit or submission.    Chair just read – I will read what he says there.  Page 10 – Eskom Bundle 15(B) page 1039 the black pagination Chairperson paragraph 147 is Mr Koko’s submission to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.     Thank you. Then I carry on reading. “Ms Klein said that she had taken her ABSA pension money and had invested it in her husband’s business and he now could not get Eskom contracts due to her being a director of Eskom while his competition was getting these – his competition was getting these irregularly.  Ms Klein stated that she wanted me to do something about it.  I was surprised by what she put across because it was contrary to every Eskom rule regarding conflicts of interest.  I informed her and husband that I had no knowledge of the intricacies of the conversation – conversion project at that time or any irregularities in relation to the awarding of tenders in respect thereof.  I told her that I would however look into the matter.  I then phoned Dr Klein on I believe Monday 16 January 2017 and I arranged a meeting with him.  I for purposes of meeting – of the meeting called in Eskom’s Chief Audit Officer as well as members of the OCGT Guess Conversion Project team.  I introduced Ms Klein to them – Mr Klein to them when he arrived and asked him we hear him out regarding his complaints.  I then stepped out of meeting.  Ms Klein’s attitude towards me tinged from that time.  She must have expected that I would course the contracts that had allegedly been irregularly awarded to be channelled to her husband.” Ms Klein can you comment on that?    Chairperson I received the affidavit from Ms Klein we have it but it is not – it has not been incorporated in the bundle yet.    We could certainly do so.    I think my – my – one of our investigators will run copies.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  We..    Yes.    Yes, no it does we will have a look at the report as well.  I know you have given me the affidavit but I do not think it has the attachment – any attachment to it.  But we can arrange after the hearings.    Yes.      Okay.  Thank you.  Now let us go into the affidavit on transactions – the evidence that you set out there. And we start first and foremost with this cooperation…    She sets out in the affidavit Exhibit U14.3.    Which is Eskom Bundle 1 page 400.43.    It will not be necessary anymore.    That is the extent to which I needed to refer to it.    Yes thank you.   So we are back in your affidavit Eskom Bundle 2 page 400.43.  Ms Klein we – I would like you – let us deal with the Cooperation Agreement and the Fourth Addendum which was concluded between Eskom and OCM owned by Glencore at the time in 2014. That Cooperation Agreement is intended to make certain changes to the agreement that then existed between Eskom and OCM in order to increase first and foremost the price of coal OCM was selling – the price at which OCM was selling coal to Tegeta – to Eskom. The Cooperation Agreement came to the BTC for consideration on the 13t h of April 2015.  You were not a member of the BTC, correct?    The BTC did not decide the matter it referred the matter to the board.  The board had a meeting in Cape Town on the 23rd of April 2015. You recall that?    This – at this meeting apparently this matter came to the board’s attention for decision making and we understand that the matter was not decided by the board as well but that the board referred the matter to Mr Brian Molefe.  You recall that?    Now Mr Brian Molefe’s approval the secondment – approval for his secondment was only made in that meeting of the 23rd by the board.  And the approval being made with effect from the 20t h of April 2015 to request.  Can you tell the Chairperson what were the board’s reasons for – well before I ask that question let me ask you this one.  Is it – who would have requested that the matter be referred to Mr Molefe instead of being decided by the board?    Ja but who would have suggested on the board that the matter be referred to Mr Molefe instead of being decided by the board?  Can you recall?    Yes you can go into it.    Yes.  When you say mana – there were questions that management did not answer or could not answer did the board specifically raise questions with – with management?  But I do not want to say management.    Can I narrow it down to the team that was negotiating the Cooperation Agreement and the Fourth Addendum. Did management raise questions with this team?    No sorry the board – did the board raise questions…    Yes.  Well I am – I have put this version to Mr Andre Van Heerden who is preparing an affidavit for the commission and he - which will be provided to you in due course but let me say what he says and I hear your view.  He said the team that negotiated and presented to BTC was not called to present to do the same in respect of the board and did not receive any questions from the board on the matter.  So that is why I am asking you whether do you personally know – whether do you personally know that questions had in fact been raised with that team?    Yes the - I said  Andre but it is actually Mr Johan Bester – ja it is actually Mr Johan Bester who was involved in the negotiation he testified previously before the commission.  He said although they did the presentation at BTC they were not invited to do the same for the board and that they did not receive questions from the board in regard to the Cooperation Agreement and the proposal made by OCM.  Hence my question to you whether do you personally know that the board had raised questions with the negotiating team?    As we understand from your affidavit and the affidavit of – affidavits of other board members the matter was referred to Mr Molefe for the purposes of him getting information and giving feedback to the board.  Is that also your understanding?    We have as the legal team have seen from other board members affidavits that they have no recollection of Mr Molefe reporting back on the matter to the board.  What is your recollection?    Yes.  Chairperson was in the – what Ms Klein is referring to is on page 400.55.  Ms Klein you might – you may want to turn there.  But now this is in September 15.    You were not aware.  So then we come to September and you call it a report of the Chief Executive Officer.  Are you on that page 400.6…    Is that under paragraph 6.3?    Okay there is a heading there after the first paragraph there is heading Optimum Coal Mine Proprietary Limited and Optimum Coal Holdings Limited.      Is that the paragraph there under is that what you want to refer the Chairperson to?    Yes.  As where you…    As where you picked up that he was reporting back to the board.    I have read this paragraph and the reporting is not of the kind that I thought he was required to do.  In fact here it is a report that the negotiations have been terminated as opposed to I have obtained information and this is what – these are the facts let us decide how to go forward with the matter.      What is your comment on that?    Okay.  Yes but let me hear your answer to this.  I accept that that with the benefit of hindsight you realised that you should have asked more questions.  What I was saying to you is if the board’s decision on the 23r d of April 2015 was for him to get information and come back to the board – report back to the board what is happening here in September is not that kind of reporting.  In fact what he is telling you is that he has terminated the negotiations with OCM.    Yes but is that not problematic because BTC which is a sub-committee of the board had specifically referred the matter up to the board and the board not the BTC or any subsidiary for – committee of the board made the decision to refer it to Mr Molefe on the basis that he will obtain information and come back to the board.  But not to make a decision that he made.    Yes because – the impression Ms Klein created and you would know from the investigation by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee or the oversight role they played the impression created is that Mr Molefe was brought to Eskom for a particular purpose and that purpose on the face of it appears to be to assist the Gupta brothers in order to obtain contracts with Eskom.  Do you have any comment on that?    Yes.  But what is also more troubling is that the impression is created that the board also created an enabling environment for that ulterior purpose to be achieved.  I mean you as the Chairperson earlier said you – some board members may not have known, maybe acted to say the least negligently.  There might have been other board members who knew what was happening as an ulterior motive the real purpose for making certain decisions but I am just putting that to you so that you can comment to the Chairperson that the more troubling issue is that the board which is the gatekeeper or should have been the gatekeeper in the exercise of its fiduciary duties making decisions of this nature that you nonetheless created an enabling environment for some of these decisions to take place.  Your comment?    Yes your comment, proceed.    Yes.  Okay thank you.      Yes.    Thank you Chair.     Yes, Chairperson.  We can proceed.  Ms Klein, you can still hear us?     Thank you.     Thank you.  I was about to move to the second or the – ja, the second point in the transactions which is what you deal with on page 400.47, Eskom Bundle 2.       Yes.  Ms Klein, before I ask you a question on this.  It was brought to my attention during the lunch adjournment that that report we referred to of Mr Brian Molefe, although it was there in the pack to the board, it was in fact not presented to the board.  Can you – do you recall that?     Yes, I do not know whether you have also a copy of the minutes of the meeting of the  t h of March 2015(sic) which would have ...[intervenes]      10 September 2015.  I beg your pardon.     No, remember ...[intervenes]      Ja, remember his report is dated 9 March.  I mean, 9 September.  Sorry.     Ja, 9 September 2015 and it was meant to be presented to the board on the meeting of the  t h of March(sic).  No, 10 September.       Yes.  I know that you have a collation of the minutes of the board meeting.  So I was asking whether you do not have that one as well of the  t h  of March(sic)?     Of the 10 t h of September.     Yes.     Yes.  Under paragraph 8.2 where he talks about the Chief Executive’s report. It reads ...[intervenes]      It was noted ...[intervenes]      It is the minutes Chairperson.     The Chairperson will find them in Eskom, Bundle 14(C), page...  Bracket C.       Page 841.     Ja, the Chairperson is getting the...  And I will just read.     Ja.     We did, ja.     Yes.  No, you are correct there.     Thank you, Chairperson.     Yes, and they did tell me they will join the meeting.  They will join the hearing but they will blank themselves and keep themselves on mute.     Yes.     Yes.     No, but they can place themselves on record Chair.  I think you are correct.     Advocate Don Mahon(?).     Thank you, Chair.  Yes, let us have Ms Klein back.     Yes, they start on page 834.     The only relevant portion Chair is 841.  And Ms Klein, you are back? Under paragraph ...[intervenes]      Ja, just under paragraph 8.2.  It says    Yes.     Yes.     Okay thank you.  Now let us get to the submission, requesting the board to make the prepayment decision of R 1.6 billion.  That submission is drafted and submitted to the board on the 8 t h of December 2015.       The board, in terms of that submission, is requested to make a decision, to make a prepayment.  Correct?     We have referred to that submission which you will find in Eskom Bundle 18(A) on page 281.       Page 281, Eskom Bundle 18(A).  In our previous session or the session with the previous witness, we went into this submission Ms Klein.  So we are familiar with it.  I hope you are also familiar with it?     You are?     And so just to sketch the picture.  This document is drafted against the backdrop of negotiations between Optimum and Eskom regarding the existing Coal Supply Agreement at the time between the two parties. Optimum goes into business rescue when it appears that negotiations between it and Eskom are collapsing in regard to the increase of the coal price. In that process, OCM seeks to – it gets offer to sell its share.  You have at the same time Mr Koko who engages with the DMR, drafting a letter a response to which would form the basis of the submission as well. Do you see from his affidavit that the submission incorporate that letter to the board?     On the 8 t h, an email is sent to the board, asking the board to make a decision the next day at     To make that decision by way of a Round-robin.  Please explain to the Chairperson, what was your understanding of this submission in the sense that which party, that the submission proposed that the prepayment be made?     Okay.  Talking about the request for IFC.  What we see from the documentation provided to the commission by the witnesses, is that the member of the board who had requested, at least made a request for the matter to go to IFC, was Ms Viroshini Naidoo in an email reply to Ms Daniels. We do not see any other member requesting that the matter be referred to IFC.  Your comment on that?     Yes.     Yes, I have not personally received that but ...[intervenes]      Two days ago?     Okay I will ask ...[intervenes]      So.  But then let us go further in order to answer the question now.  What did you understand was the prepayment made – for which entity was that prepayment meant for?     H’m.     Yes, so by OCH, you mean the company that was owned by ...[intervenes]      No, that is fine.  That means the company owned by Glencore?     Yes.  So that means – I mean ...[intervenes]      That is correct Chair.     H’m.     So you are not necessarily wrong Ms Klein.     Ja.  So by that understanding, just confirm to the Chairperson.  That means the prepayment was not meant for Tegeta?     Yes.  And what made you understand that the prepayment was meant for OCM owned by Glencore and not Tegeta?     Thank you, Chair.  Ms Klein, talking of a company in distress, what is also maybe of consideration for you to comment on is the fact that eight months before in April 2015 this very company had indicated that it is in distress and it had declared a hardship or invoked the hardship clause seeking to get Eskom to increase the price of coal, not on a prepayment basis, but on a monthly basis.  So increase the price of coal from R150 per ton per month to I think what I have seen from the affidavits to R442 per ton and this is prior to it going into business rescue.  Could the same sentiment not have applied eight months before which you say applied now in December 2015 because the company is the same insofar as the board is concerned?     Yes.  Yes, indeed, that question is very significant, Ms Klein, because when you look at the timelines the company, OCM, went into business rescue in August 2015 and this is before the report that was tabled by the Chief Executive – Acting Chief Executive Officer at the meeting of the 10 September 2015.  So if there was anything urgent, by virtue of going into business rescue, that urgency would have arose at that early stage.     Yes because it seems to be given as a reason.  If you read paragraph 2.2.1 of the submission     No, go ahead.     Yes.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes, Chair …[intervenes]     Thank you, Chair.  The closest, Chair, one comes to in regard to urgencies on page 284, under paragraph 3.6.     The degree of urgency, if there is anything.     It reads    I think …[intervenes]     This is on –well, the submission is dated the 8 t h.     Given to the board to make a decision on the 9 December 2015.     But, Chair – Ms Klein, I do not know whether you are aware of this, the facts on the other side on OCM’s part is that they were engaging with Mr Koko and by this time, when he writes this document to the board, he had been advised on the 24 November and on the 1 December 2015 that Glencore has taken a resolution to take OCM out of business rescue and it will provide funding to OCM and OCM will honour their agreement as it then existed to the end of that agreement, December 2018.  Did you know about that?     And in fact when you read the affidavit of the legal representatives of Eskom who advised Eskom on these transactions between OCM and Eskom itself, that is CDH, they say in their affidavit that OCM continued to supply coal to Eskom from August 2015 and they put it to July 2016.  It may well be that it is shorter than that, April 16, because after April Tegeta takes over but the period in December, in January, February, March is covered by OCM supplying coal to Eskom.  Did you know that?     Okay.  Then the next day, the 10 December, there is – a prepayment resolution is used to obtain – I mean, to do a conversion to a guarantee, a guarantee of the same amount but not to OCM, guarantee to be issued in favour of Tegeta, the very next day on the  December 2015.  Was the board aware of that?     Did you and/or the board make any follow-up in regard to the decision that was made on the 9 December 2015 and, by the way, this was decision made by way of a round robin, the board didn’t meet to discuss and ask questions.  Did you make a follow-up?  We have made a R1 billion decision, over a billion rand decision, what is going on?  Is OCM out of business rescue?  Are we getting supply, have we avoided load shedding?  Those questions to the executives.  Were they asked?     What do you say about – because the people we see involved in the guarantee on the side of Eskom is Mr Anoj Singh, Ms Caroline Henry, who prepared the submission, is Ms Suzanne Daniels who ultimately put together this guarantee, get it to the bank, the bank issues a guarantee in favour of Tegeta and then the underlying agreement is signed for the pre-purchase of coal by Mr Anoj Singh.  And just before I ask you this question – sorry, I am reminded of something, did Mr Anoj Singh take part in the IFC meeting, the teleconference?  He did?     So he was privy to discussions at IFC.      Okay, then he takes part in the guarantee.  Do you have anything to say about that, about his conduct?     Yes.  Okay, I want to move on to the next point in your affidavit, the next and last point, on page 400.49, Eskom bundle 2.     Yes.     The meeting was on the 1 December, Chair.     Yes, the first meeting is on the 1 December, it is followed up on the 2 December.      There is a verbal agreement.     To sell.     On the 10 t h…     The significance of the 10 t h, the date of the 10 t h coincides with the conclusion of the agreement.     Between Tegeta and Glencore.     I do not know about him attending the meeting.     Yes.     Correct.     Mr Glasenberg.     Yes.     Minister Zwane, yes.     Okay, that is the meeting of the 2 n d.     Correct, that is the meeting of the 2 n d.     I mean, the signing is on the 10 t h.     Ja, the day the guarantee is issued.     There is the signing happening, subject to suspensive conditions until the 31 March 2016.     The guarantee also has suspensive conditions.     The date is the same.     31 March 2016.     Correct, so – that is correct.     The same date, 31 March 2016.     Because the payment, the full payment is due I think on the 13 t h or 15 April.     And so by the time – so the date of the suspensive conditions is made in such a way that it is very close to the payment, the full payment date.  That is in April 2016.  And that is where you start seeing from the 8 t h, before the 13 April, before the 15 t h, from the 8 to the 11 t h of April an unprecedented action is taken on the part of Eskom to do a prepayment again of 659.     Despite the Board meetings, PTC meeting scheduled for the 13 t h ...[intervenes]      They push for them to meet on the 11 t h at night.      Yes, Dr Nteta was testifying about.     They push to have that meeting on the night of the 11 t h of April at nine o’clock.     I think it is BTC.     Exactly Chair.  That is exactly what I was putting, the version of Mr Khoza I was putting, obviously Mr Khoza himself has to answer questions in regard to this.     But the coincidence, at least for now the impression created is remarkable.     Absolutely remarkable.     Ms Klein I was referring to page 400, point 49 of Eskom Bundle 2.      400 point 49, it is the McKinsey matter.  I am simply going to read from your affidavit, in paragraph 11 you’re answering a question that has been asked to you.  Now you see we’re focusing on a particular aspect of McKinsey/Trillian as introduction to Eskom.  We have a witness who has testified that when she was at Regiments and they were servicing Transnet they had meetings with Mr Anoj Singh prior to him commencing his duties as a seconded CFO at Eskom, they had meetings with him at private hotels, talking about matters of Eskom.   You may or may not know about it, do you know?        Regiments ultimately the directors or shareholders separate and Mr Eric Wood in particular incorporate a company called Trillian and he does so together with Mr Salim Essa.  They then start or it, Trillian, start rendering services to Eskom and you would recall that they in fact did not have an agreement with Eskom, Trillian.     And some payments were made to them without any agreement in place?     Yes,   In fact Ms Mthepu in her affidavit and her testimony before the Commission is that in March 2016 Glencore – not Glencore – McKinsey conducted a global review assessment in respect of Trillian to determine whether they can have Trillian as a business development partner at Eskom, which is a sub-contractor to McKinsey and the outcome of their assessment was negative and they decided and told Eskom we will not have Trillian as a support development partner, did you know that?     You didn’t?     Okay, well to the extent you have dealt with the matter involving McKinsey in your affidavit just tell the Chairperson then what you would like to draw to his attention, it involves a submission to the Board to make a decision on the 10 t h of September 2015 about procuring the services of McKinsey.     Yes, I was asking a different question but because of ...[intervenes]      No because of the preparation session you anticipated another question.     Yes, no I will ask that question ...[intervenes]      Yes, I will ask again.     The information as contained in your affidavit was that a submission was brought to the Board at its meeting on the 10 t h of September 2015 for the sole sourcing of McKinsey and that what you have discovered is that even as the submission was brought to the Board on the 10 t h of September 2015 the agreement had already been signed on the 8 t h, is that ...[intervenes]      It is correct?     And I think you do say it was Mr Koko who had already signed the sole-sourcing agreement.     So what did they want the Board to do, if the sole-sourcing agreement is already signed a few days prior even coming to the Board.     Oh so you were not aware at the time.      Yes.       You were not aware.     Okay then let’s go to the question you anticipated and you answered.     No that is alright, regarding your – what you refer to as a potential conflict of interest, and I pick that up from Mr Khoza’s affidavit as I indicated to you, that in the meeting there was talk about, or you raised that you might have a potential conflict of interest because according to him you were in negotiations with McKinsey to render services to McKinsey.     Yes, however the minutes of the meeting record that you had in fact done work for McKinsey, now can you explain that ...[intervenes]      Yes I want us to refer the Chairperson to that minute, can you recall it?     The minute where the conflict, the potential conflict is reflected, I want us to refer the Chairperson to that.     Yes, get to the page where he deals with McKinsey.  I want you to find and read it to the Chairperson Ms Klein.      Yes, give us ...[intervenes]       Give us the page reference.  The page reference.     Thank you Chair, I see she is struggling to hear me.     I did.  Yes I am looking for that minute where it is recorded Chair, because it is important what is recorded there vis-a-vis what Ms Klein is explaining, but just read it to us because the minutes of the 10 t h of September don’t seem to have that, isn’t it a different ...[intervenes]       Yes please.     Yes, so the minute explicitly says potential conflict in that you said the company did some work for McKinsey.     Ja, are you saying – but what are you saying about that?   Is that a correct reflection?     Were you – did you recuse yourself from the meeting or not?     Did you do work with McKinsey after that?     Chairperson that concludes the questions I have for Ms Klein.     She testified about it Chair.     Yes she did, and ...[intervenes]       Yes, that is what we haven’t done.     Yes Chair.     Yes.     Okay.     Sorry Chair.    That supplementary submission Ms Klein referred to I thought we should just place it on record and admit it as well before she leaves.     The one ...[intervenes]      There is one which she refers to in response to Mr Koko’s version that she had invited Mr ...[intervenes]       No it is not there yet.     It is here, or we can incorporate it.     Yes, Chair I will beg leave to have it admitted as – I now the Chairperson doesn’t ...[intervenes]      I have the original here.     I do have my copy.     And one which I can hand up.      It is a – well Ms Klein has given the Commission this submission.     Ja, she calls it a submission Chair, it is a supplementary submission to be submitted to the ...[intervenes]      I think it is – Ms Klein you can assisting us there.     Correct, those are annexures.     Ja, let me do, let me right it.     Yes.     Well should I do that?     Thank you Chair.     Yes.     Ms Klein what you have provided to the Commission it is a document dated 10 April 2018 which is on the face of it addressed to the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee of Public Enterprises and you have relied on this document or drawn it to our attention as a response by you to Mr Koko’s allegations.  Can you hear me?

Yes we are ready Chairperson thank you.  Now Chairperson the next witness as I have already indicated is Ms Naidoo.  Ms Naidoo is legally represented by my learned friend Mr Barry Roux and we will give him an opportunity to place himself on record.    Ms Naidoo is ready to take the oath or affirmation.    Thank you Chair.  Ms Naidoo is appearing for the first time Chairperson before the commission.  She has submitted an affidavit which is found in Eskom Bundle 14(A) on page – the affidavit is on page – it starts on page 269.1 Exhibit U29.  Ms Naidoo you will have the same …    Correct Chairperson.  Ms Naidoo you are there?    The – that is your first affidavit to the commission it runs up to page 269.56 - 259.56.  You see that?    There is a signature there above the deponent do you confirm that to be your signature?    The affidavit is dated 8 December 2020.    You confirm this to be your affidavit yes.    Thank you.  Chairperson there is another affidavit and I will come to it.  I will beg leave to have this affidavit the main one I will call it admitted as Exhibit U29.1.    Yes I am going there.    269.238.    Now the third one Ms Naidoo runs up to page 269.261.    Is that your signature?    Affidavit dated – what is it 8?    Yes I think so.  8 February 2021 so that is two days ago.  Chair I would beg leave also to have this affidavit admitted as Exhibit U29.2.    Thank you Chair.    Yes certainly.    Are you on the main affidavit?    Okay let us go.    Just hang on.     Yes 26 – 269.2.    So I completed my articles at More Naidoo and RC    RC from?    Oh 1995.    1996.    Yes 96.    Does it affect the next – the 1995 in the next line?    Does it affect it?    Yes.      Oh.    Use the…    Black pagination.    269.9?    Okay paragraph number?    19.34 17 February 2015?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you Ms Naidoo.  Chairperson Ms Naidoo is called mainly to deal with the issue of the transactions but as an introduction to that we could deal with – could lead evidence on your background Ms Naidoo and your appointment to the board of Eskom in December 2014 – 15 – 14 or 15?    Yes.  Ja.  Please tell the Chairperson your occupation briefly including your – the work you do yes.    11 well I do not know in your case but…    Was it 12?    Were you – were you appointed to the board of Eskom?    On the 12t h of December 2014?    I – I see from your affidavit that – ja page 269.2 – ja paragraph 3 that you are an admitted attorney indeed if you turn the page to 269.3 in paragraph 7 you mentioned – well 6 in 2007 I relocated to Johannesburg and joined Telkom SOC Telkom as a legal advisor.  In 2008 I left Telkom and joined Bytes Technology American Tower SA and Impac Limited as senior legal counsel and in the latter two I was Group Leader or counsel.  You go on to say in 2000 I established the petroleum business which supplied fuel to Transnet …    No that is all I want to read to you.  What I want to ask her is which petroleum company is that?    If you could face the Chairperson.    Yes.    Ja but what is the name?    Africa. Okay.  So I went to your CV which is on page 269.58 – 269.58 it starts there but I want to refer to page 269.60 because you list the companies that you have worked at but I see in your affidavit there is one company you did not mention which is Albertime Pty Ltd the period of employment there being from 2015 to 2017 position held legal.    Is there a reason why it is not being mentioned?    Okay what – which company is that?    So let me repeat the question Chair so that the Chair – in her affidavit she mentions the companies that she has worked for.    But there is one company which she did not mention in the affidavit but it is found in her CV.    And the company’s name is Albertime Pty Ltd.    And I was asking her how is it that it is not mentioned in her affidavit.    Yes.    Phased it.    So what is this company?    Yes.  And – so the next question was what does the company do Albertime or did do at the time you were there?    Whose company is Albertime?    I have picked up from the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee transcript of your testimony that your husband is Mr Kuben Moodley.    And that he was an advisor to Minister Zwane.    And this would have been from the 1s t of October 2015 to 31 March 2016.    Did that present any problem for you serving on the board of Eskom in 2015?    Problem of what sort?    Yes so what transaction was being discussed?    No this particular one where you said..    Yes and you tell the board in which meeting about which transaction?    Oh I see okay.    I understand now what you are saying.    What was the board’s view when you say you did not want to be involved in any transactions involving mining companies?    So – so why is it a problem only in 2016 because he is appointed on the 1s t of October 2015 and here you have a transaction coming up on the – in December on the 9t h of December 2015 involving a mining company Tegeta or OCM?    Yes.  Well and the article was obviously reporting on what had already happened.    Because Mr Zwane had gone to Switzerland on the 1s t of December.  He was there on the 2 n d December and had made it possible for the deal between Tegeta, Oakbay and OCM Glencore to be concluded – struck – the deal to be struck.  Insofar as you say the company Albertime was an investment and consulting company you rendered investment consulting services did the company have anything to do with Tegeta related entities?    Not Tegeta sorry the Gupta related entities.    Oakbay, Tegeta.    Nothing at all.  How did you get appointed to the board would you tell the Chairperson – of Eskom?    Yes were you – was this the first board you had to serve on?    But never in SOE?    How did you come to know about it?    Oh.  Was this the first time you came across an article that indicates – or what is the effect of the article that they…    Eskom’s…    I see.    Yes.  Tell the Chairperson whether did you know any of your board members prior to their appointment?     Yes.    How did you know Mr Mark Pamensky? MS    What should we consider him to have been a family friend?    Family friend.  So he – you and your husband would have known him.    Did you – oh – well you say Mr Khoza you knew him but did you know him personally?    No.  So you knew of him?    From Telkom?    Other than that you did not know any?    Of the board members.  May – the Gupta brothers.    Did you know them.    Ms Salim Essa?    Did you know him before coming – before your appointment?    And how did you know him?    So you came to know him as a result of your husband knowing him.    He is friends with your husband?    Did they do any business together?    Not at all?    Before or after?    So they know each other as what – friends?    Okay.  And in that process you came to know him?    I think you have mentioned occasions where you would have met with him?    Ja Mr Essa where you would have met with Mr Essa.  Can you tell the Chairperson those occasions again?    Did your husband play any role in your decision to apply to serve on the Eskom board?    He did not advise you to apply?    Or discourage from applying?     Thank you, Chair.  Yes, so you – you say your husband did not play any role in your decision making.  You have said – I just saw something.  You said you knew Mr Pamensky socially.   In his affidavit, Mr Pamensky says he knew or he knows Mr Salim Essa. I have known him for the past 11-years.  At the time when he was deposing to an affidavit.  Have you and Mr Pamensky ever been with Mr Salim Essa, all together?     Yes, this is ...[intervenes]      Oh.     The ANN7 ...[intervenes]      Is that the ...[intervenes]      It is the news channel that was owned by?     Yes.     Yes, one of the interrogated entities.  Okay.  Now at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, you were also asked about Albertyn (Pty) Ltd having apparently or allegedly made a financial contribution in favour of Tegeta for the acquisition of OCM.  I cannot recall what was your response to that question.     Oh, you did.     Ja.  Alright.  Okay let us do this.  Let us deal with the factual premise of the question, whether or not Albertyn did in fact make a contribution to Tegeta for the acquisition of OCM and whether you knew about it?     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.  I mean, he has told he did not.     The company did not.     Good.  I know the investigators are doing something about it but if we find anything we will share it with you.     ...Mr Tsotsi.     Ja.     Yes.  Just remember, the arrangement because the suspension has been an issue we dealt with first and foremost before the transactions in a chronological sequence because it comes first. The people are moved out of Eskom, the executives and they are making a way for new people to come in and from there we see how the Corporation Agreement is dealt with between Eskom and OCM.  Ultimately the prepayment in December 2015.  Decision.  The guarantee thereafter.   And then you have the April 2016 prepayment decision.  So what I am going to do is, is to put aside for a moment the suspension issues insofar as they are dealt with in your supplementary affidavit because we have not – I have not even read it.  We have not even shared with the people who might be implicated.  We have to make that determination. So I will go into the transactions and starting with the Corporation Agreement.  That agreement reach – dates back to 2014.  It comes to the BTC in April 2016 on the 15 t h.  The BTC does not decide the matter.   I understand that from the evidence there is a question mark there because the matter fell within the BTC’s delegated authority.  Is that correct?     Yes, okay.  You are fast.     Just give us the threshold again.     R 750 million to a billion>     That will be the BTC.     So the BTC can make decisions on those?     Yes.  So the Corporation Agreement despite falling within the BTC’s delegated authority, the BTC does not make a decision on.  It refers it to the board.  The board sits in Cape Town on the 23 r d of April 2016.     Were you present in person?     You were?     You did not join by telecom?     Ja, except for two.     Yes.  No, I am saying, you are saying basically all of you were there but I think two joined by teleconference.     Ja.  Anyway.  But they would have participated in the meeting.  In that meeting, it is unclear what – whether this item is properly on the board’s agenda.  Can you recall?  The Corporation Agreement and the addendum form?     No?  You do not have any independent recollection?     Yes.     Yes.     No, approved it.     It was not ratified, approved it.     Oh, it was a very informal board meeting?     Yes.     H’m.  Was it scheduled?     Was it a scheduled board meeting?     Well, if it informal, maybe not.     So in that meeting, the matter of the Corporation Agreement between Eskom and OCM is referred to by Mr Molefe.  You recall that/     And you deal with the basis on which it was referred to him.  You can tell the Chairperson quickly.     Ja, but just tell the Chairperson the basis on which it was referred to Mr Molefe.     It was out ...[intervenes]      The budget of BTC?     The budget within Eskom?     Sorry ...[intervenes]      Sorry, Ms Naidoo.  He what?     No, but ...[intervenes]      No, hang on.  We are talking about the meeting of the 23 r d of April 2015 and the questions, you say, the board had.     On that occasion.  Ja, but on that occasion.       Yes, yes.  So ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Okay.  How did you put the questions to management?     No, how did you put them to management?     In which way, yes.  Did you send an email, did you send a letter?     Or was management there, present and you had done putting question to them?     And which would be management in this case.     Yes.     No, there was no executive.  We heard Ms Klein said there was no executive.  You are meeting in Cape Town.  It is an informal meeting.  It seems not to have a prearranged meeting.  The minutes of the meeting are here.  All we see is all of the board members except for two who are joining in by teleconference.  Ms Khumalo and Mr Pamensky.  Then there is Phukubje the Company Secretary and the Committee Secretary, Mr Wayne Vellore.   Even Mr Molefe is not listed here but he was there in that meeting.       Was it not?       Yes, it was.     Yes.     Yes.  That you heard when Ms Klein was testifying.  I also said to her, on this very question, that...  Well, firstly she confirmed management was not there and that it was not expected of management to attend board meetings. But now it is even – what is it – I did not want to say – it is even more – ja, telling that it was an informal board meeting.     So management clearly was not there.  But the second thing is.  I said to her.  Mr Johan Bester who was on the Negotiating Team on behalf of Eskom.  He says he did not receive questions from management.  I mean, from the board.   But you – I think you say what you know happened. If it did not happen ...[intervenes]      If management was not given questions, from your recollection, it was not.  If it was, then say it was and then you will have to say how it was given those questions so that we move faster.     Ja. If you can recall.     Ja.     Okay.  The minutes of that meeting...  Chairperson, they are in Eskom Bundle 12.  Eskom Bundle 12 ...[intervenes]      No, she will help you.     The minutes ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Eskom Bundle 12, page 241.  That is the Reference Bundle.       Correct.  The members who were present at the meeting.       241.  Is that bundle...  Eskom Bundle 12.       Yes.     So you see...   [Background noise interruption]     You see who were present at that meeting?     In person and by way of telecom, telephone.     But to the extent that you want to say executives were there in this meeting, that will be inconsistent with what Ms Klein said.       Yes, you are right.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.  Okay.     Ja.  And...  Okay so, what were you expecting him to do?     Okay.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     No ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.  No, no ...[intervenes]      Yes.  Leave the Public Protector aside for a moment.  In their proposal by OCM was increasing the price of coal from R 150,00 per ton to R 442,00 per ton.  So that, you were saying, was too much for the board.     Ja.  So you referred the matter to Mr Molefe.  From Mr Molefe to come back with this information.     Yes.     Yes, more information.     And does he do that?     He did not?     That is in 2020?     In 2020.     Ja?     Yes.     Yes, we were looking at earlier on.     No.  No, wait.  [laughs]  You want to explain what happened, what?     No, before you do that.  Before you do that.     [laughs]     To come and testify.  [laughs]     [laughs]     Yes.     Ja. Well, before you go into that.  It is because when I read your affidavit and I am looking for where you are dealing with this prepayment or rather this meeting.  Ja, it is on page – it starts on page 269.35.  No, that is your main affidavit.  Eskom Bundle 14(A), page 269.35 going over to page 269.36.       269.     Point 35.  269.36.  Ja, Eskom Bundle 14.  So paragraph 87, it just goes right into the issue.       You are here?     Oh, it is alright.  But the paragraph 87     So on that ...[intervenes]      Yes, Chair?     Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  That sentence, Ms Naidoo, is important for a different reason or another important reason.  If you knew and are stating here that the current agreement and that is the agreement between Eskom and OCM would continue or was in place into 2018 at the current price, Eskom would continue receiving such a supply until an agreement was concluded, which is a new agreement.  In other words, the status quo remains until 2018, until you conclude another agreement.  And having said that, let us see what happens here because the board then will have to explain given that fact how does it deal with – or rather, explain how you – the manner in which you dealt with the submission for a prepayment of R1.6 billion in December 2015.  So Mr Molefe has terminated the cooperation agreement.  You say you did not know about that. He has given …[intervenes]     Yes.     Not even terminated but he has to come back to you to give feedback.     Because he is given the matter to go get more information and give to the board because there are unanswered questions or questions that cannot be answered by the team.     Yes, so – now he has to come back to you but he does not.     In July he terminates the agreement, you come to learn about it only after your resignation from the board.       After 30 June 2016.     Which is in November.     20..?   2016.  So that minute, what is it, that legal report which Ms Klein referred us to is not part of your evidence.       It is not the legal report, the CE report which has the legal part.     Is it in your submission?     Okay, but you only came to know about that …[intervenes]     …now when we gave you the request for information .     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     That is right, yes.     Yes.     No.  No, no.     Mr Barry said I should control you.     I should do that.     Ja, he said if I do not he will intervene and stop you.  Ja, okay, so you came to know about the termination when you read the Public Protector ’s report.  But the question is this, which is what we asked Ms Klein, we asked Dr or Prof Naidoo, how is that the board did not follow up with the executive after the matter is referred to him, which is a  serious matter, involves lots of money, and what is generally, we have told, regarded as a key power station, Hendrina power station, why does the board not follow up?     Ja.     Okay.     Yes, okay …[intervenes]     Yes.  So the short answer is you do not know why he did not come back.    Or why the board did not follow up.  You do not know why the board did not follow up.     Because the prepayment of R1.6 billion is also a transactional matter, is it not?      And it came to the board.      And the board decided it overnight and by round robin.      Without a meeting.       So you say yes?     Yes.  Let us deal with this because – so the impression, as I said to Ms Klein, is that Mr Molefe is coming there on a placement, if you like, so he is being sent to Eskom.  Mr Salim Essa has spoken about him at a meeting in 2014 that you will see how powerful we are and we have decided who is going to be the CEO of Eskom, in 14, to one of the witnesses who came here, Mr Bester, and he says Mr Molefe is going to be.   When in March 2015 Mr Matona is on suspension for reasons that the board members who have come here have not been able to explain and Mr Matona is fighting to come back and fighting, meaning he is taking legal action to come back …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, thank you, Chair.  So ja, they did have reasons that were not related to what was stated in the letters of suspension and given to the members.     Correct, Chair.  Thank you.     Yes.     Sound.     Yes, thank you.  So that clarification accepted, Chair.  So while Mr Matona is on suspension and fighting to come back and having taken legal steps, that is what is meant by fighting to come back, on the 17 April 15 Minister Lynne Brown makes the announcement that she had decided – she has taken a decision to second Mr Molefe with immediate effect to Eskom.  So there is no waiting or awaiting of the outcome of Mr Matona’s issue and seeking to resolve that issue before making that decision to have Mr Molefe come to Eskom.  And when he comes three days, or whatever days it is, certainly at the very most – if he started on the 17 April then at the very most on the 23 r d he has six days at Eskom, he is given this matter.  He is given this matter which has been handled by the inside team at Eskom since 2014 and I believe dating back to 2013.  But he is new, the matter does not go back to the team, it goes to him with the instruction, if you want, or the decision by the board that he should get information and come back.  But he does not do that, he does not come back to the board.     One.  Two, he terminates what was being negotiated and there, the board does not follow up with him, please report back, because we have given you this matter, it is about supply of coal to one of our key power stations.   And I said this to Ms Klein, with that impression in mind, that he has been sent to Eskom, the incidental impression which arises on the part of the board is that the board may have acted in concert with his conduct in that it created an environment to enable him to do what he did in failing to call him up to account on what the board had decided he should do.  What would be your comment?     Yes.  Ja, well …[intervenes]     But the submission did not include an extension for 25 years, the submission proposed that you, as Eskom, should reserve a right …[intervenes]     Yes, reserve a right, if you so wish, to extend it.     To that period.  That was the proposed, that you reserve that.     Yes.     Yes, face that side.    4 …[intervenes]     Ja, no, certainly, Chair.     Ja, the right to reserve is – the benefit of the one who reserves it can exercise it or not extend it.  Ms Naidoo, then – okay, we have gone through that, let us look at the submission - eight months later the board is approached with this submission for a prepayment of R1.6 billion.  The board is approached by email in the evening of 8 December 2015, the email comes from Ms Suzanne Daniels in which she is asking the board to make a decision by 12 noon on the 9 December 2015.  The two members of the board who testified before you have said that they understood that submission to require a prepayment to be made in respect of or to OCM owned by Glencore.  Now this is a decision that would be made by way of a round robin.  How did you understand that submission to require the board to decide?     Face…     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Ja, so which entity was going to receive the prepayment?      Maybe for the Chairperson you can, or for the record.        Yes, thank you Chair.  Ja, Ms Naidoo on the one hand those questions arise that why urgency and the convolution between the two entities which one actually was going to get payment but if the Board understood it to be OCM as under Glencore, that statement in that paragraph 93 of your affidavit, becomes even more     Ja, but business rescue started in August 2015. MS     Way before.     So if there was any urgency, you say the urgency was that, there will be load shedding?     Yes.     Ja, I get lost in your explanation.     It is fast and you know without breaks, but let me – let us say this to you, you make the decision for this pre-payment.  You believing it to be going to OCM for business rescue.  You are making a decision for a pre-payment of 1.6 billion whereas eight months earlier you refuse to increase R150,00 per ton.   The price of a R150,00 to 442, four, four two which would have been a monthly payment, as opposed to a pre-payment of a huge amount all at once.  How did you deal with this?     Yes, in addition to that by this time in December 2015, Glencore had already made a decision that it is taking OCM out of business rescue, it will fund OCM and OCM will comply with the agreement to the very end.      The commitment was made on the -  conveyed in the meeting of the 24 t h of November 2015 and finally resolved by the end of that month and certainly given to Mr Koko on the 1 s t of December 2015.  Did you know of that fact?      I see, so on the 1 s t of December 2015 there is a meeting taking place in Switzerland convened by Minister Zwane with Mr Glasenberg and Minister Zwane is there with Mr Salim Essa.  You would not have known about that meeting?     For the price of R2.1billion purchase price by Tegeta of OCM.  And what we see here it is a parallel process, what is happening within Eskom and what is happening outside of Eskom.  And it seems to have been that Eskom is taking, the Board of Eskom is taking decisions that were intended to assist, financially assist Tegeta in their acquisition of OCM.  Your comment?     That is right.     And Mr Atul Gupta.     That is right.     Ask the question, Chair.      Hank.     1 October 2014.     He was at the DPE.     DG at DPE.     18 months Chair.     Yes, ja.     Yes, I don’t want to sit until seven.     Thank you Chair.    Yes thank you Chairperson.  Yes Ms Naidoo I was paying attention as you were using the word you pushed back. I do not know is it you as the board members or you in particular please remember to put on your microphone that you pushed back and I am trying to see whether did you in fact push back in regard to this pre-payment we are dealing with because I recall seeing your email saying yes you approve but simply saying let the matter go to IFC and …    PFMA approval.    Yes.  Yeah but where is the pushback?  Because I understand pushback to be that you would have been opposed to the decision being made.    Is that right?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes just face…    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.      Thank you Chair.  The – yes Ms Naidoo perhaps – well for what it is worth you know the email of your reply to Ms Daniels it is on the 8t h of December 2015 at    Ja.    Yes.  In terms of?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes what Ms Naidoo is talking about are those emails exchanged with Mr Anoj Singh and Eric Wood and…    I think they go – did they go to infoportal?    No but we talking the outside person.    Who was …    Ja but if you talking pushback in that context are you trying to say to the Chairperson that you knew that this was going on and you were pushing back on that?    But – ja but then pushback is a misnomer because you did not know what this (speaking over one another).    No but you are not asking for the matter to go to IFC you say that; that IFC committee has approved purchase.    Ja and Ms Klein is also saying…    Okay.  Ms Klein also says that is what she wanted.    No but the…    No but were you aware that she wanted it?    Okay.    No your email is here.  Your – so the board then with all the questions the Chairperson has asked you, I have asked you has made this pre-payment decision R1.6 billion you say in your understanding it was going to OCM.  The next day the 10t h of December 2015 something alarming takes place which is a conversion of that decision into a guarantee not in favour of OCM but in favour of Tegeta.  Was the board aware of that?    You say you had already left?    You left.    Yes.      Yes.  I have a faint recollection of something said in Mr Pamensky’s affidavit but I do not have it here.  So I will not mention it because I might be confusing the two pre-payments.  Because he questioned – he said it came out in the newspaper – he read it somewhere and he questioned sending an email to the board members that we should not be rubber stamping – I just do not recall where was his email.  I hope we can check when the email was sent.  My impression was that email was sent before you resigned as a board member.    Okay not that one.    No not that one.    Oh the board was not made aware of his appointment.    Ja.  So Tegeta…    Ja.  Tegeta – Tegeta needed funds – needed funds to pay the R2.1 billion for the acquisition of OCM and you have this guarantee issued in its favour on the t h of December which is the same date when they signing the agreement for the sale of shares of OCM – in fact of OCH on the same date.  According to the evidence of Mr Pearce Marsden Tegeta needed to show that it has the funds to do the purchase and it needed to show the bank of consortiums – the consortium of banks because the consortium of banks was loaning money to OCH – OCM.  So when you look at what was happening it would seem that either the pre-payment decision or the guarantee itself was meant to assist Tegeta in showing that it has the necessary funds to do the purchase.  Do you have any comment on that?    Yes.    But thank God IFC held a meeting the next day and their minutes were absolutely clear that the money goes to OCM.  So how they then facilitated a guarantee in the favour of another entity that is nowhere in this transaction is beyond me.  But that was not the intention of the board and that was not what we signed off.    Yes.  Did the board make a follow up on the decision it had made?    Yes but this goes back…    Yes let us go back to December because the decision is made on the 9t h of – yours is actually given – your approval is given on the 8 t h of December.  So you did not wait for twelve on the 9t h to find out if you made this IFC requirement a prerequisite for your decision you did not wait for it to be fulfilled you gave your consent and then you say – you say semantics that IFC committee has approved the purchase.  From December 2015 to June 2016 when you ultimately resigned is a period of seven months.  What did you do in that period to find out what happened with this massive amount of a decision that was made by the board by way of a Round Robin?    Yes.    Yes that is right.    So – oh he is busy I am sorry.  Ja because I was going to ask you what is the answer to the question.  Neither did the board follow up.  But why?    But why because…    So are you saying it should not in the first place have come to the board?     Yes and the board makes the decision because – on an urgent basis.    For reasons of the risk of supply and I think you did say there might be load shedding if you do not make the decision but I mean it is a – it is an explanation in the submission also talking about business rescue.  Ja somewhat confusing.    Is that 2016?    So what did you ratify because the…    No, no. why – no I am asking you. What did you ratify?    So you did not know about the guarantee?    Did you know that the guarantee the terms of the guarantee came about – came from an email of infoportal to Mr Koko from Mr Koko to Ms Daniels and Ms Daniels instructing the attorneys CDH to draft the terms of the pre-purchase agreement.    You heard the evidence we led.    All the more to the Chairperson’s point about how outside people were influencing what was happening inside Eskom.  I mean in that trail of emails it leaves one with no doubt that that guarantee does not come from within Eskom.  It is a decision from somebody outside of Eskom because he provides the terms of what should be in the guarantee.    On the 9t h of December.    These minutes are not signed Chair.    They indicate a Round Robin decision.    Yes that is the…    I have conceded.    There can be minutes.    There can be minutes for a Round Robin.    Yes.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And – ja…    Yes.    A distinction.    Yes.     Yes, the...the minutes.  I will refer you to the signed minutes.  They are in Eskom Bundle 18, page 584.       Page 584, Eskom Bundle 18, one eight.     Ja.     Bracket A.     18(A)..     18(A).  So ...[intervenes]      Page 854, five eight four.  So there is only item on the agenda.      Yes, paragraph 5.   “Noted that there was only one item on the agenda which as discussed around a Round-robin resolution for the urgent request to approve the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal (Pty) Ltd.”     Yes.     Ja.     Okay Chair.     Thank you, Chair.       Half-past six, yes.     Let me finalise.  Indeed.  So Ms Naidoo, you see the sequence of events. In December 2015, the board does not ...[indistinct] say.  And four months later or less than four months later, in April 16 the deal has been concluded. The deal is subject to suspensive conditions, the purchase of shares in OCM.  That would expire on the 31 s t  of March 2016.  The full payment has to be made on 13 or 15 April 2016. On the 11 t h of April 2016, the Business Rescue Practitioner, Mr Piers Marsden is approached by Mr Nazeem Howa.  And he says to him, Tegeta has a shortfall.  He is Tegeta’s CEO.   Tegeta has a shortfall of R 600 million.  We cannot.  We are struggling to do – to service the balance.  And could you approach the consortium of banks for a bridging loan of them to defer the amount. 11 April 2016, a response is given to Mr Howa     Do you have any comment?     Ja, sorry just before that because I know that you served on BTC.     At this stage.  Okay so you went, if I recall, this request for BTC to meet by way of a teleconference would have come to you as well.     Why was it so urgent?     So...  Yes, I...  If you followed the testimony of Dr Nteta.  She said and repeating what is in her affidavit.  That she did not see a reason why the meeting should be convened on the 11 t h because the decision could comfortable be made on the 13 t h of April 2016.  What do you say to that?     Well, the teleconference is not recorded.  You say as usual.       Ja.  The other thing that I want to put to you from Dr Nteta.  I asked her whether could this supply plan of April 2018, which is relied upon in the submission, be used to justify the alleged urgency.  And her answer was no.  She said I know where you are going.  My answer is no.  Because I know where you are going.     Yes.     Yes.  Did the BTC member not ask this question?     That is right.     You are right.  The mandate?     Yes.     I asked the question whether did they mislead the BTC.  Should I ask you that question whether you feel that you had been misled?     Yes, the other thing is ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes, Chair.  The last thing is.  Did I say the last?  The other thing.  The other thing is.  At that time, Tegeta did not have a contract with OCM.  It had not concluded the contract with OCM to procure the coal which it was offering to Eskom.  It did not have the contract. In fact, the written offer explicitly says to Eskom that they will be buying this coal from OCM and selling it to Eskom.  I am paraphrasing.  But they will purchase from OCM to sell to you. So there are two things.  The one is, they do not have.  The second thing is.  Why did you not deal directly with OCM?  Why this middleman, this intermediary?     Did you get that information?     Yes, but did you get that information?     Unencumbered assets?     Okay.     So you are saying to the Chairperson.  You gave this company R 659 million repayment despite knowing that it had growing concern issues?     No, the banks had frozen their account.     Chair, I am going to finish with this.      No, no.  Not a normal transaction.  Tegeta ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Okay but now the reason given in that very submission is that Tegeta have requested a prepayment in order – and I paraphrase – to reopen the export component of the mine.       No, in the submission itself, not the written offer made by Tegeta on the 11 t h.  Because Dr Nteta said that one was not placed before the board.       Yes, the submission itself.     It talks about the export component of the mine.       No, it does not say it is going to give you coal from there.     Ja, let me...  That submission, when it     It is a long, long paragraph.     Yes, but if you are saying to the Chairperson the coal that was going to be supplied was from the stockpile.  Why did you let them to make a prepayment?     Ja, but that is not Dr Nteta’s evidence.     Yes.  Chair, I will bring it to ...[intervenes]      Yes, we will... [laughs]     [laughs]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes.     Chair, tomorrow?     There are two witnesses scheduled for tomorrow Chairperson.  We will – the first one is Mr Mark Pamensky.     The second who is oversees is Ms Suzanne Daniels.     And I know that there might a slight change in regard to that...     ...with Mr Mark Pamensky.     He might be – based on what we need to have him cover, about three hours Chair.     Ja.     It might.  It might not be possible.     Ja, he has given us a supplementary affidavit which I am yet to read.       Ja, we may have to deal with it along the lines with Ms Naidoo.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     Thank you, Chair.

DR NAIDOO:  Yes.    Oh sorry.  Thank you.    Pathmanathan Naidoo.    Thank you Chair.  I will take it off.    My full name for the record Pathmanathan Naidoo.    No Ma’am.    Yes Ma’am.    So help me God.  Thank you.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.     Top left.    Page 3 ja.    Page 3.    This is page 1 – but this page 3 on page 1.    Use the left or right?    The left.    Eskom 16.3    Right I have got it.    Thank you.    Okay.    Thank you.    Yes.    Confirmed.    Yes Sir.    Ja.  26, 27 got it.    Confirm.    Okay I have got it.    Thank you.    Correct I have got it.    Yes Sir confirm it is my signature.    Confirmed.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Confirm.    Correct.    Yes.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Correct so.    Yes Sir that is the appointment to serve on the board of Eskom.  Correct.    Yes Sir.  Chairman my career with Eskom commenced in the – with the Electricity Supply Commission.  This was in the early ‘80’s and I concluded my career with Eskom in 2010 as an employee. During that period I served on the boards as Eskom representative, on the board of Motraco the Mozambique Transmission Company, on Wesco as the Western Power Corridor Company and I also served in the capacity as official on the Eskom Holdings board. Thank you Chair.    Certainly not – no one.    No one.    No Sir.  I do not even know the gentleman.    Yes Sir.  Atul Gupta.  Some – at almost two decades ago 03 I was a member of the Eskom Delegation that accompanied then President Mbeki on his inaugural state visit to India.   In India Mr Atul Gupta International introduced himself to us as an investor in South Africa.  He was in – coming to invest in ICT and he had then at that stage launched Sahara Computers.  And he invited us the business delegation to come and have a factory visit – Sahara Computers in Midrand. When we returned to South Africa he had scheduled a visit for us to visit his factory.  We attended that visit and he conducted that visit personally.  So that was the second time I met him.  That was in 2003 as I documented in the affidavit.  Thank you Chair.    Certainly not – certainly not.  Even during 03 I had no interaction.  It was in a public setting he had introduced himself and even at the factory visit it was in a public setting.  We had no interaction.    Certainly none. I met Minister Brown first tie when I attended the – when I was inducted into the board.    Certainly not.    Thank you Chair.    No Sir.    No.    Yes Sir.    Thank you.  Thank you Advocate.  Chair Advocate is referring to an operational document between Eskom as the company and OCM as the supplier.  I had no details of the operational content of that – or no part in its structure or in its promotion. Chair I want to reflect a little bit on Optimum Coal Mine, on Hendrina Power Station and give you a little bit of a background if I may?  Thank you.   Chair Hendrina Power Station and as you will Chair sorry I was an employee of Eskom so I have been to Hendrina many times.  Hendrina Power Station in the category of lowest cost producers of electrical energy.  It is in the company of Koeberg the Nuclear Station in the company of Cahora Bassa the Hydroelectric Station that brings us power from Mozanbique. Very, very low cost power.  The station was built in the 70’s and its coal supply agreement then commenced with the miners.  And the coal at Hendrina Sir is on the ground.  You literally scoop up the ground and you feed it    Please do Chair.    Agreed.    Agreed.    Agreed.    But – and that gave the mine an export allocation quota at Richards Bay.    On the MLO Richards Bay coal line that high grade coal will then go into the export.  Eskom made that allowance and that is part of the- one of the addendums Chair.   But again the price was kept low.  And then Chair as the – the agreement was coming towards a closure I recall the agreement was scheduled to end December 18.  So this is a development now in 2015 and the Optimum Coal Mine then said I need a higher price of coal. They want to reset the base price because there is a potential that is a new agreement could be reached post 18 for another ten years, twenty years, thirty years at a higher price. And I was part of that discussion at the investment and finance committee and I knew a little bit of the history of this all and I said no ways we cannot adjust that because then we are changing the design of the power station, we changing the whole model that we put on the … When 2018 concludes you will have an opportunity for both parties to decide on a new contract going forward.  And Eskom can decide whether it still wants to operate Hendrina or do not operate.  That was basic where the push came and where the resistance from Eskom came in terms of not allowing the    Yes Chair.    Certainly Sir.    Yes Chair.  Chair if we reflect it was a very long term contract.  If it is 2018 built in the 70’s it is almost a fifty year type contract.  It is coming towards the end now 2018 it is almost sort of days to ending.   The boilers at Hendrina as I said earlier Chair they were designed to burn this ground literally not coal call it the ground here or there.  And – and that whole model was packaged around it.  If you changed – change that model then the whole thing falls apart.  And again Hendrina was – was a cash machine – a cash machine for Eskom.  It made a lot of cash for Eskom.  A lot of electricity sales.  And you do not want to disturb that model Chair that is basically what it was and that is why that price was fixed long term. And again this hardship clause was introduced and an addendum to that effect was introduced to give the supplier relief export on the coal mine. And around 2015 Chair the external coal market also collapsed so you could see where Glencore’s position was or the shareholder of OCM position was.  He was not making money on the export market and not making money on the domestic market incurring costs. And again saying to Eskom I need more cash, I need more cash.  That sets the basis for that pre-payment, that then arrived thereafter.  So that is it the foundation.    Agreed Chair.    That is very clear.    That is very clear.    I fully agree.    Thank you Chair.    Correct.  Correct Chair.  In fact there an – another development before pre-payment that was business rescue. The shareholders of OCM then put the company into business rescue and now we are dealing with business rescue practitioners and again the – the message conveyed to Eskom jobs will be at stake.  We are going to stop the production; people are going to lose jobs.  And again when I reflected on that particular position of the job Chair I said power stations has been there for fifty odd years it has created jobs for the community.  It is a matter of days before it is going to stop working and again it has done its share for the community so let us not make jobs a particular issue to focus on.  Let us focus on the – on the national grid security and make sure the machines are working, make sure there is continuity of operations. And again Chair during that business rescue operations unknown to the business rescue practitioners Eskom had been in deep distress, load shedding was at its all time high – there was – there was a lot of disturbance within the operational end of Eskom.  But unknown to them we had already commenced the recovery of Eskom Generation. And Eskom Generation Energy availability factor was already on the recovery. We could accommodate one or two machines being disturbed because remember these are small units 200 megawatts.  So if you do bump it you are going to bump 1 200 or 2 200 or so but not all of them.  And we could accommodate that disturbance on the national grid without disturbing security of … We knew that and that is why we sort got into a little bit of an entrenched position regarding this price of coal.  And we said we would like to hold onto the - this - whatever is in the contract – you, me renegotiate that end of December 2018.  And we feeling comfortable we will manage national grid security.  We were very happy.    Correct.    Correct Chair correct.  So they were pushing on the increase of the coal price and then simultaneously they throwing business rescue, simultaneously they throwing loss of jobs for the community.  So it is compounding itself.  It is getting more and more difficult.  But again at that time Chair I was very confident that we will maintain national grid security that was always my reference.  Are you going to hold national grid security before we break?    Well      Yes Chair in fact the hardship clause I think was initiated by the commencement of the agreement.  Never really …ever really …    Pertained to any particular supplier.    It was there it was embedded in the original  agreement.    Because of Eskom holding the price of coal delivered to its lowest level and Eskom agreed we will prepay for the capital infrastructure to mine the coal and deliver it throughout.    Yes.    No Chair it did not go arbitration.  I think Glencore…    Yes.    Yes.    Is arbitration.    Agreed, correct.    Never, correct Chair.    Correct.  Correct Chair.    Agreed.    Agreed.  Agreed – correct Chair that is correct.    Agreed.    Agreed.    Agreed.    Agreed.    Agreed Chair.    Chair and I want to also add Chair.  Had the arbitrator ruled in the favour of the supplier rather than in Eskom’s favour we would have rearranged the operation of the power station such that we reduce the quantity of coal that we get.  We would have shared that load across the fleet of power stations.    So instead of burning X volumes at Y price we would have adjusted the volumes to burn at that price so that we can keep the cost to the company constant.     Agree.  We will comply Chair.     But we will make operation requirements to handle the impact on the company.       Chair, ja it could result in them seeing it as a victory but in terms of the net or the focus costs to either company, it will be constant.     That is the name of the game.     [laughs]     Yes.     [laughs]     Thank you Chair.     Yes, Chair if I may.  I think the decision that there was not taken to board.     Was it not cancelled out again?     To the Chief Executive.     To the new Chief Executive.     Mr Molefe, correct.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Correct.     Yes, Chair it would go back to the team but via the Chief Executive.  It is an operational accountability.  Sorry, Chair.  It is an operational accountability.  It goes back into the organisation and the point of entry into the organisation as the chair.     But that is all that it was.  And again, as the earlier discussion we had.  There are lots of complexities around it.     Thank you, Chair.     I would expect so.     He would report back, ja.     Specifically no sir but the Chief Executive does report to the board on a monthly basis.  At the board meeting there is the Chief Executive’s report.  I am not sure whether it was contained in that report.      No, sir.     No, that is an operational accountability.     Chair, the ...[intervenes]      No, I think the – the best I can give you Chair is.  At the Investment and Finance Committee when I made that – when I chaired that committee, there was this issue of the prepayment and in that prepayment conversation, my best understanding was that Glencore was still the owner of OCM.   And I did make my comment in that conclusion of that meeting that given the two parties to come to some agreement, Eskom and OCM, that the chairman of Eskom and the chairman of Glencore should make a joined statement of that effect.  I made that and I put it in my records.     Right.     Right.     Correct.     Correct.     Yes.     Right.  Thank you, Chair.  Chair, this was – this did not come to a formal meeting.  We got a request electronically.  It was an emergency request.  It came through electronically.   And I was a member of the Investment and Finance Committee.  That is where it came to.  And the chairperson of the Investment and Finance Committee recused himself and I found myself in the chair now chairing this meeting, not in a formal setting but on a Round-robin resolution.   And I looked at the request of prepayment.  Prepayment for coal from Optimum Coal.  And the prepayment value of R 1.68 billion.       R 1.68 billion.     Ja.  Ja, that was there.     And when I looked at it and I looked at the submission that was tabled, it motivated firstly this agreement between Eskom and OCM.   Remember they had a strained relationship, they have now come to an agreement.  They are happy together.  OCM requires cash in advance to give them liquidity so that they can get on with their business.   Deliver the coal to Hendrina Power Station plus also take the coal and sell it to the export market and they will make more money of it.  That was there sort of motivation.   And they also said they are in the process of taking on more Black Economic Empowerment in terms of their contractual relationships within or shareholder relationships within OCM itself.   And they have got some support and we could assist them with this R 1.68 billion.  We will ensure security of delivery of coal to Hendrina Power Station.   Also, they extended the delivery to another national power station, Arnot.  And they also said they will secure the jobs of the people.   So when we looked at all that we said prepayment is certainly an industry practise.  Eskom does this all the time, not just on the coal side, even on the electricity sale side.   You can be a prepaid customer to buy electricity.  And when we looked at it we said the security in terms of that R 1.68 billion, the security and the inventory – as I said the coal is at Hendrina’s, not to anyone else’s.  It is right outside.  We have got security on that inventory against that R 1.68 billion.   And we said the R 1.68 billion prepayment would be absorbed by operations within a few weeks literally.  So that we be used.  And it is a win-win situation for Eskom and for OCM.   And it is in that response, I said towards the end of my note, this is a positive development given the distress of where we coming from.   And I think the chairman of Eskom and the chairman of Glencore should make a joint statement to this effect that we both came together and we working together.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes, yes.     Agreed.     Agreed.     Agreed.     Correct.     Not to Tegeta.     No, there is no Tegeta Chairperson.     And Chair, this was done in my apartment in Parktown.  I am at home.     I am not in a boardroom.     And that is why I wrote down those points and I have communicated that to my fellow colleagues.     I said    And I was now in the chair of the Investment and Finance Committee.     That is the reason I tabled.     Yes.  Thank you, Chair.     18...?     Please help.     Thank you.       Yes.       Right.  I have got it.     Okay, I got it.     And 286?     Okay, I have got it.     Right.  I have got it.     Yes, that is my note.  Correct.     Confirmed.       Thank you gents.     Yes, yes.  I have seen it.     Correct, ja.     Both.     Ja, this is my document here.  It is my response.     Chair, if you look at the ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Yes.     Correct, after the submissions.     Right.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes.     Why I went that direction?     Yes.  Chair, on page 283, there is 3.2.21 highlighted yellow.  I think this was my highlighting of yellow.     Ja, this is – because on my note I say    Sorry, sir.     No, I migrated to 283.  Starting at 281, we skipped all of that, we have gone to page 283.     3.2.1 ...[intervenes]      Oh, sorry Chair.     Oh.     Right.  Chairperson, the – let me go to 279, a little bit before that.     279.  This the minutes of the Special Telephonic Investment and Finance Committee held on     The chairperson had recused and Dr Naidoo is the acting chairperson.     Right, Chair.  That is the document.  And then the submission, the Round-robin submission to the Board of Directors, page 281.     Correct.     Okay.     Yes.     6.1, ja.     Optimum Coal (Pty) Ltd.     Correct.     Correct.  Just one agenda item.     And the submission for that agenda item was – is on page 281.     The Round-robin submission to the Board of Directors.     Submission.  Pre-purchase of coal of Optimum Coal Mine.     Right.  Ja, the same submission.  I am     That is the point highlighted in yellow.     Then 3.4.1 highlighted yellow    Yes.     Right. “The advanced purchase of R 1.68 billion will secure future supply of coal to Eskom and will be funded by a reduction of Eskom’s coal stockpile from 54 days to 40 days.”     Yes, yes.  That is...[intervenes]       Oh, ja.     Yes.     Yes.  Then Chair...  Oh, sorry Chair, let me go a little bit slow.  At 3.6 we talk about risk including environmentally legal or contractual risks and other     3.6.3    I have just read to you.     One    Yes. “Their full rights, responsibilities and accountabilities will be as per the Companies Act. They plan to use the pre-purchase proceeds to address the liability and liquidity challenge. This will be a positive development, both for OCM and for Eskom. It will address the present day contractual obligations and create the platform for the future sustainability of mutual take, business and job continuity for fellow South Africans.”     Thank you very much for handing this.  Thank you.  I could not find it.  But thank you sir.     Yes, members of the ISCS(?) Board of Directors.     279.        Yes.     This is a recommendation from IFC.     Correct.     Correct.     Can I read that resolution Chair from the minutes?     Oh, you are find it?     Thank you, Chair.     Oh, okay.     Thank you, Chair.     Ja.     Thank you, Chair.     Correct.     Hundred percent.     Correct.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair I saw that.     Yes.     No, sir  This – in terms of this, the Business Rescue Practitioners were still present.     So the ownership of OCM was still in that sort of greyish area but for now the record speaks very clearly that the contractual relationship is with Glencore, not with anyone else.       No, but I appreciate it.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     No, we had no details of them.     We had no details of the proposed owners.  It was still, in our mind, Glencore is the owner and in the     Let me answer it this way Chair.  The agreement, the Coal Supply Agreement is between two companies.     Eskom and OCM.     That is it.     Under Glencore.  Yes.     Yes, that is correct.  But there is something happening in the background ...[intervenes]      ...that we do not have details of that.  We only stayed within the contractual boundaries between Eskom and OCM.     Yes, Chair.     Yes, Chair.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  The contractual, as I said Chair is still Eskom/OCM, OCM, that is the contract.  The contract is not between Eskom and Glencore.  The contract is not between Eskom and proposed owners.  The contract is not between Eskom, Glencore and maybe more BEE partners, the contract is Eskom OCM, so that is what we focused on, Eskom OCM.     I know, I see that, Chair.     Yes.     Yes, Chair, you are correct, Chair.  That word proposed opens a big door.     Yes.     Ja, it should have been, Chair, I agree with you.  Should have had, with the existing or current owners of it.     But the heading is correct, the title of submission is correct, pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal.     Ja, you are correct, Chair, you are correct.     The minutes.     279.  And the resolution is on page 280.     Same.      “It is recommended that board approves the  transaction as set out in the submission to the board relating to the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum (Pty) Ltd.”     Ltd.     Either way, correct.     The signed minutes, page?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Under Tegeta.     Still OCM, ja.     Changing the shareholding.     Changing shareholding.     Ja.     I do not know whether they changed the name of the entity but they purchased shareholding in OCM and they carried calling it OCM and …[intervenes]     Ja, because, Chair, the contract is still the supreme document.     You see, the contract, the supply contract, that is the supreme document, it still refers to this also.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that was just a cut and paste proposal.     That is what happened.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.  Yes, I agree with you.     I agree with you.     10 – 12.     Ja, around there.     Yes.     Ja, Chair, this is the point where I think trust and integrity comes to the fore, you have to have trust and integrity otherwise it is very difficult because you are working in a high-pressured environment, volumes of work coming through very quickly and coming through in high speed, you need trust and integrity.  Without trust and integrity it does not hold.     Yes.     Agreed.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, Chair.     No, Chair.  I think, Chair, I just want to raise this point.  The supreme document, as I said here, I is the coal supply contract between Eskom and Optimum Coal.  The money will go from Eskom to Optimum Coal, that is where.  But again what happens thereafter, Chari …[intervenes]     Agree, Chair.     Agree.     Yes.     Agreed, I agree.     I agree.     Thank you, Chair.     Thank you, Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Yes.     Correct, Chair.     Yes, Chair.  Yes, Chairperson, our understanding was that the – as I said earlier, Chair, the supreme agreements, the coal supply agreement between Eskom and OCM, Optimum Coal Mine, as owned by Glencore.  The change of ownership of OCM had not yet occurred.     Thank you, Chair.     Yes.     Correct.     No, sir.     No, sir.     No, sir.     Chair, there will be feedback back to the board.  At the next board meeting we will receive feedback and I think that the feedback that we received was to the effect the coal was procured, the coal was used up and that whole prepayment has been completely absorbed.  So we bought the coal in advance, we received the coal, we burnt up the coal, we made electrical energy and that whole prepayment concluded.  That was basically the feedback.  Thank you, Chair.     No, not.     No, sir, not.     No.     No.     No, sir.     No, sir, I would not have knowledge.     No, thank you, thank you, Chair.  No, thank you, Chair.     Yes, that would be in Germany yes. That is fine, Chair.     Thank you, Chair. 
MS KLEIN:   Good morning Chairperson and Advocate Seleka.     Venete Jarlene Klein.     No I do not.     Yes I do.     So help me God.     I am trying to, so where are we now, which page are we now Advocate?      I am going there now, that is correct sir.     Yes, I am.     I will find it, yes I see that there.     Okay, ja I am going there 400.5.     I have got it, thank you.     That is correct, yes.     No I cannot actually, I just see myself on the screen here but can you see me?  Okay there I see you on the screen now.      Looks like 18, hey.     Yes, that is correct Chairperson.     I am there Chairperson.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct Chairperson.     I do.     Yes, that is correct.     I do.     Thank you very much for your consideration, Chairperson I appreciate it.     Yes, I do sir, I do Chairperson.      Correct, sir.     Yes.     Chairperson at the time when the decision was taken that there was this vote of no confidence of Mr Tsotsi, what had happened was in the formulating of the actual charges, the company secretary at that time might have set up a ...[indistinct – distortion] and met with the attorneys who had helped us in the actual drafting of the charges because there were various charges that were being brought.  And it was on the basis of the recordings of the discussion of the 19th that Mr Matshela Koko together with the attorneys of record at the time, I forget the name, and formulated the actual charges.   Those were definitely one of the things that I can talk for myself that made me lose confidence in Mr Tsotsi, I cannot speak for anybody else.  But if you say it is not one of the charges, the charges were formulated based on the actual recording of what was discussed on that particular day.     Chair that is a very difficult question for me to answer, you made a call.  I was not at the meeting on the 9 t h where this not report but where the meeting or what had transpired to get this particular resolution from the Board was discussed.  So when the Minister came in at that point in time there was to my knowledge, I did not have any idea about the report.  The way I remember that was the report was only discussed at the meeting that transpired after the Minister had left.     Well, Chairperson I can only talk for myself. But when I heard about the report like I said it may have been discussed in the meeting of the 9 t h and I am sure you will test that with other members of the Board.  But I first heard about that in a discussion when Mr Tsotsi after the Minister had left so he told us how much work had already been done.  So I would not have thought it needed to go back to the Minister because Mr Tsotsi who had effectively now had - we have heard the Minister saying that there is work that needs to happen to get the company stabilised. If I could just maybe add on Chairperson whenever you sitting here in load shedding stage three, were in crisis. The Minister has told us when she first met us, I think at the end of December and she told us again, guys get a handle on the business. Now we sitting and we facing an investigation or an inquiry rather, which quite frankly I supported when I heard all about it because I thought it would be a way of ruling or getting a line in the sand and in understanding what one is dealing with.  But the report came up later when, if I remember that correctly, when Mr Tsotsi was telling us more about what he believes or why he believes, you know that we need to do this and we need to do this quickly.  So I did not think at the time personally I did not see the need to go back to the Minister and talk about the report because she did not mention the report Mr Tsotsi did.     Chairperson on the question on what the evidence leader is asking me now is obviously the report was important, you know to us because it was certainly used as motivation to say guys you got to kick start the process.  But like I said is the charges that were formulated against Mr Tsotsi was based on the recordings of the discussion of that day, which is possibly why he was not charged with it because it could be like to say, maybe that was part of the reason he was not charged with this because another Board member maybe felt that let us just move ahead and get this done.     Chairperson I do not think that I actually addressed it in my affidavit at all advocate, Chairperson if you can help me I do not think I addressed it in my affidavit so I am going to speak from memory if that is okay with you.     At the time when…[intervene]     Yes, okay, please direct me if there is a document.  But I do not think that I addressed it in my affidavit.  I do not think that I would have called Mr Baloyi a problem child.  What I think I myself that is talking here, is that the Board would make a decision and after the Board decision was made - and understand how difficult it is, as a Board member sitting there not every decision is made in agreement with you.  At the end of the day, whether you agree or not you kind of need to accept that the majority of the Board members have made this decision and if you go - you cannot constantly be objecting of that sorry I do not agree; I do not agree.  There are certain times in critical decisions gets made then you do that. But what I battled with personally and like I say I am talking from memory is that we would agree as a Board on various things, we would then later on the same night get emails and email trails - and Chairperson I think you would be in a better place because you probably got Mr Baloyi’s affidavits where he will then disagree with what the agreement was earlier in the day.  I mean can I give you an example maybe just to demonstrate the point.   On the removal of Mr Zola Tsotsi we had gone through an entire discussion, which obviously the attorneys allow them to use to then formulate the charges because we just formulated it.  Norman Baloyi then comes and adds on what he thinks must goes into it and I think that made you know, fulfilling the fiduciary responsibility very difficult to add stuff on after you know, after a Board meeting.   And I think that was if you are asking my opinion I am talking from, I am talking from my memory and total recollection right now but I think that to me was the charge.  Chair, I hope that answers the question.     Thank you, Chairperson.     No, Chairperson I did not know one of them.  Other than obviously the only person that I could say that I know something about was Romeo Kumalo because I mean he was a public figure but beyond that, no.     No, no I never met him personally.     No, sir never met them.      No, never met any of them, no never.     Like I said in my affidavit I was at one of the breakfast and I was introduced to him but beyond that no, I never got to know him personally.     It was one of those breakfasts that I think Eskom was, you know, one of those EMA things I think so, it was at a particular breakfast I remember him coming up and introducing himself at it.     Correct, yes.     No.     Minister Lynn Brown Chairperson I got to know in my job as head of retail, bank of ABSA.  We had a couple of functions and because of her profile she was invited to one or two of them and that is where - if I remember correctly, the first time I interacted with her personally was with the opening of Private Bank in the ...[indistinct] of the Baxter, that is the first time I actually got to meet her.     Chairperson obviously I got to know her better when I became a member of the Board of Eskom because there were always meetings that I was invited to where she was present.     No, I did not but in my time at Eskom I also went onto the Board of the Reserve Bank and I attended a meeting with the former President at his residence when we had to go and discuss with him – I was the Chairperson of the Remuneration Committee of the Reserve Bank and as that I was called upon to go with the Governor and one or two other Board members to go and discuss the renewal of the contract of one of the Deputy Governors.     Yes, I do Chairperson.    Yes – thanks Chairperson I am just trying to pull it up on the screen myself but the – okay (not audible).    Open Cycle Gas Turbine sorry I am not the technical person please do not just ja.  Open – open cycle gas turbine.    Chairperson let me ask you do you have my supplementary affidavit that was after that had been presented to Parliament I put through an affidavit to Parliament dealing with the exact matter.  Do you have that in front of you as well?  I mean I can talk you through it but I     I am happy to respond Chairperson in the meantime.    Alright, alright.  Thank you Chairperson.  If you could – I refute Mr Koko’s version completely.  Let me put it to you this way you know it is – I know that this is not a life matter but you know in front of this really commission I was literally accused of bringing Mr Koko back you know or literally on my volition which obviously is not true. So why would I wait literally fifteen months to ask Mr Koko for business for my husband in the first place would be my response.  But now let me just deal with the matter that – that the evidence leader put to me. The reason Mr Koko was called and he was not called to my house – my husband was on a panel of project managers that had been appointed by Eskom in that time.  So it is not like – I would not ask him to work with none of them.  My husband has been appointed as a Project Manager because he – he holds a Doctorate in Civil Engineering.  So he was appointed as a specialist if you will.  During that time in fact before Mr Koko became the acting CEO my husband’s company and by the way you can go and check all the conflicts of interest.  I had a record of that time after time that you know he was on this particular panel.  He was then given a piece of work to provide Eskom with a number of civil engineers for particular work that needed to get done. When he provided the CV’s of the people those were just not good enough.  It was struck off.  Whilst all this toing and froing was happening my husband got a call from somebody by the name of a Gavin Sheer or if my memory serves me correctly I am talking from memory here now.  Gavin Sheer who said something like this to my husband; he said look I am working for Eskom your company has been given the opportunity now to find these specialists to work on OCGT’s but this is how it is going to go.  And please excuse me if I do not get the numbers right because I am talking purely from memory now.  What he said was – or what he said to Harold was the total that you will get paid was something like R1500 an hour but the total that you will get as a company is R100.00 and I will keep the R1400 because I am already here and you will just get the R100.00 per hour.   Obviously because I was a board member my husband came to me and says to me what do you think of this?  I said well this is nothing short of fronting.  He said so what do we do with it?  I said to him I do not know what to do with it but let us try and escalate it within Eskom. I was not going to take it to the board because I did not consider it a board related matter.  It was an operational issue.  That all happened at the time when Mr Koko became the acting CEO.  Mr Koko was asked to speak to my husband in that particular week because everything came to a head just after Christmas I think that was January 2017 to speak to Mr Koko but because he could not make it he was busy obviously now acting as CEO and my husband could not make it – it ended up that the meeting happened to be at my home. That was the reason that he came there to point out the fronting which he as the CEO had to go and investigate.  Now by the Monday following that particular Saturday there was a meeting and a whole host of people were called to the meeting.  Obviously I was not part of it but there was an investigation done and Mr Koko did call forensics, audit and forensics and a whole range of other people and as part of my submission to Parliament with my version this is Mr Koko’s version I attached a copy of that report which had been redacted which I am sure that the commission could call and just see if it was about – if the meeting was – my husband was about work for my husband’s company which by the way he had already been allocated but it was a whole fronting arrangement or whether it was to get more work from Mr Koko.    Chairperson I hope that brings some clarity to the point that evidence leader has raised.    It was    yes okay.    We can – look apparently it was sent Advocate but we can certainly make sure that all the other things will be sent to you as well if you do not have it.  Alright.    That is correct Chairperson.    I do Chairperson.    That is correct.  Yes I do.    That is correct Chairperson.    No I do not.  As I said in my affidavit I do not recall who made it but I can certainly tell you why I supported it if that is going to be your next question?    Alright.  Chairperson what was being brought to the board was something that to my mind at the time management after having taken it to BTC where for some reason or other it was not concluded brought it to the board but in drilling down I mean I do not have all the details because I did not sit at BTC but if I try and remember this thing questions such as extending the tenure of a particular contract was one.  The price increase going from I think R150 to R400 odd where questions were being asked of management and he alerts me to this because like I said I was not part of the original discussion at BTC. Management did not seem to have the answers until when somebody proposed that this gets given as an operational matter back to the Chair – oh sorry back to the acting CEO at the time. I did not see that as a major problem I thought it was probably the best thing because management clearly did not have all the answers. Also remember that the tenure of that current transaction was until 2018 and we were talking about 2015 so it was not something that according to my mind needed to be drafted immediately.   Just by way of record – reference if I can just get back a minute or two if you will allow me?  Remember we were sitting with load shedding stage 3, we were sitting without money, basically we had so many boards in the air that for me something that did not need to be decided today    My recollection is that …    Sorry management or board?  Are you referring to board raised questions with …    That is my recollection.  My recollection was there were questions and I personally I can talk just for myself.  I got the sense that they did not have all the answers and I almost – I remember sitting there albeit a long time ago and thinking well that is probably why it is with board and not with BTC because maybe this – I thought that BTC got was not satisfactory which is why it was brought to    Chairperson so you – I just need to – you broke up just slightly there so you said somebody had – who had dealt with it?  You had asked this question of somebody else I did not get that.    Chairperson obviously now I do not know what Mr Bester – I did not listen to his testimony but let me put it to you this way.  It would not be unusual that the negotiation team does not recall.  I mean that is why we have got X official members of the board.  I would imagine at the time whoever was presenting it and it would probably if memory serves me correctly has been the acting CEO at that time would have probably have been the one sending the questions.  I cannot – like I said I do not remember or I cannot say who was in the room exactly. But if he says he was and very, very clearly the questions was not asked of him.    That is correct Chairperson.    My recollection Chairperson is that I picked it up I think it was something under legal in the month of September. That is where I picked up the next – you know where I pick it up next.  I am not sure what is – I have not read – I have not had the benefit of reading through the affidavits of any of the other board members but I remember seeing it for the first time in September and it was under legal when it looked like this had already progressed quite far.    That is correct Chairperson. ADV SELEKA    No Chairperson I was not aware.    It was the legal report.  Yes that is correct Chairperson.    That is correct yes this is the legal update.  The CEO report but it is with the legal update.    That is correct yes.    Yes that is the one I am referring to.    Correct.    Effectively because that was his report back to the board.  So yes that is the one I am referring to.    Yes Chair.    Chairperson not being a technical person myself I was at that stage it did not look strange to me at all.  I mean this is him giving feedback.  Remember the contract that was brought to us in – in April spoke about something that was happening at one of the you know – with one of the suppliers of coal and they were asking for more money and they were asking for an extension of tenure.  So then I looked at this I think at that stage to think there was anything strange with that.  Obviously now at the benefit of hindsight I now realise I should have asked a lot more questions.    My response to that will be very simple Chairperson maybe simple to me but maybe you see something else there is that remember we got a board sub-committee you will remember on the – on the matters of the suspensions because of me serving on PMG you already you know asked me for many answers.  I expected when I looked at this that this is probably had been dealt with would have been dealt with at one of the sub-committees.  So it did not – it did not come across as strange to me that this was clear or that he should have.  I did expect him to come back but I mean the fact that he did not and it was here – and none of the other board members raised it I did not find that as being strange at the time.    No I – I do hear you Chairperson and I am giving you – if you saying to me it is problematic I accept that it is.  I understood this at the time because remember we sitting with BTC members in the board that if this was the incorrect approach or this was wrong that is then would have been flagged as wrong.  I just – it was when you asked all the questions that I went back to go and reread it that I realised that this is the first time it actually came back to the board.  And I am not trying to make – I am not trying to trivialise the matter but rather to say to you that you – as board members we were sitting with many hands in the fire dealing with many things at the time.  Now today when I look at it and obviously having heard everything I realise we should have asked – I should – I thought should have asked more questions here.  So you say problematic I accept that it is.    Other than what I have read in the media and obviously what has played out in terms of the commission I can understand how you could tell me that this is problematic.  Further than that I cannot comment because at the time when this happened I did not think that it was irregular because remember in my mind being a non-technical person we are talking about something that was supposed to only have been decided in 2018 so I did not attach any – it has got to be decided now.  But with the benefit of having listened to you know different evidence pieces and certainly the kind of questioning that you put to  me I can understand how you can see this was problematic.  I see it as problematic now.      Chairperson it is actually very difficult to even – sorry.    Sorry.  Obviously when I look at things today it looks very different to what it looked like back then.  If you were to ask me directly whether I was involved or I knew my answer to that is no.  If you were to ask me did I see myself as enabling this you know all I can say to you is you know as board members I can talk for myself.  We were dealing with so many different things coming at us.  Load shedding was still an issue.  We were dealing with lack of money.  We were – it was just coming from all angles so it is really difficult to say you know who may have known what other than what I knew.  So yes I understand and I do hear you when you say this is what emerges but I cannot really comment on that because I was part of the board and should I have asked more questions on that – now I know that I should have.  But way back then you know it is – I did not.    Thank you.     Yes.     Yes, I can hear you.     [No audible reply]      No, I do not Chairperson.  All I remember is that in going back, being asked questions by yourselves, I went and I found that report in amongst the documents in my packs.  So if it was not presented, then I cannot respond to that.  It certainly was in my amongst my board pack, thereabout.     10 t h of June?     I can refer.  Do you have a reference point for me on it?     Because I can go and...[intervenes]      Okay.     Yes, Chair?     Oh, sorry.     Are you asking me if I have a copy of the board meeting with me for the 10 t h of September?     Just hold on.  Let me see if I can find it.  Yes, I have Chairperson.     Oh.     Chairperson, I do not seem to have that but I am happy to listen to what you have got to say and see how I respond.     Yes, Chairperson?     Please Chair.     Yes, I am.     No, actually I do not remember Chairperson and like I said, you know, with the benefit of hindsight, even if I did read it and if I knew then what I know now, I probably would have had a lot more questions.     But I do not recall that specific point being discussed.     I mean, like I said I picked it up when I went through my documents when I got your questions.  That is when I really went and wrote down.     That is correct Chair.     Correct.  Correct, Chair.     [No audible reply]      I am Chairperson.     [No audible reply]      [No audible reply]      Yes.     Chairperson, my understanding was that there was this big need to do a prepayment to OCH because of the coal requirements. I must say to you upfront that because of my probably lack of technical knowledge I then wrote – I was the one – and I know that there had been other people who said that they call for an IFC. This request was sent to the entire board.  I then said, I will only sign this off if we can get an IFC going because I wanting Dr Pat Naidoo who is or for me was the most technically experienced person, to talk me through why something of this nature being R 1.68 billion would come to the board with less than 24-hours and see in which way the board will make a decision. I was not comfortable with that and I requested that an IFC be hold which obviously was not held afterwards and Dr Pat answered the questions that I had.     Chairperson...  Yes, I would like to comment.     I responded by way of a Whatsapp signed document then subject to IFC and I sent that.  I think counsel sent that to you, yesterday or the day before.  Mine was underway over Whatsapp because of the urgency of this.       You have not? ADV SELEKA     It was sent – it was sent to the investigators Chairperson.  It was sent two days ago.     Yes.     [Indistinct – distortion], yes.     My understanding was always that it was meant for OCH who was in business rescue and was engaging with whoever but my understanding was that the prepayment of R 1.68 billion was for OCH.     And so in the documents says for the liquidating of their debt. So that was always my understanding, OCH.     Correct.  OCM.  I am sorry.  OCM.     That was my understanding Chairperson.     Thank you, Chairperson.     Not according to what I read back and understood.  Yes, Chairperson.     Because when I looked at the writer, it actually said pre-purchase of coal to OCM.  That is what made me understand that that is where the money was supposed to go to.     Yes, I did Chairperson.     Yes, I do.     H’m?     Chairperson, at that time I was not looking at who the proposed owners were.  I cannot argue the words away as you correctly say but bear in mind that this organisation or this operation was in business rescue.  So I did not know ...[intervenes]      ...who negotiate ...[intervenes]      Okay.  I can talk about my understanding at the time.  And that is, that this was an operation in business recue.  I did not know who the Business Rescue Practitioners were talking to or who were the proposed owners or not.   The way it was presented to me by management was that it was with the OCM or OCH.  That is what was my understanding right through the transaction Chairperson.     I obviously did.     But from a perspective...       Sorry.     From a perspective of, we are dealing with an operation in business rescue.  We are dealing with a group that needs money to liquidate their debt.  So I was not...  I must admit, I was not looking at proposed owners at all.  My understanding was always, I am dealing with OCH.       Chairperson.     Ja.  Chairperson, let me start by saying the paragraph that you have referred to giving the Executive the right to do what they needed to execute.  That would be standard in every resolution because obviously board members are not operation.   But having said that, my understanding always has been this is a company in distress.  There is a Business Rescue Practitioner.  They are interacting with various people. So according to me, my understanding was always that I am singing off R 1.68 billion to OCM/OCH.  I never – I must say, you ask me now if I see it?  I probably did see it but I did not think anything of it because it is a company in business rescue where the practitioners would need to engage with a whole range of people. So if I should have taken interested into it because that is what you are asking me, then maybe I should have but I always, in my head it has been clear, it has been OCH.     Yes.  Chairperson, all I can say to you is.  You know, with the benefit of hindsight, I find that the wording was actually quite clumsy.     And I always think that management purposely putting words there because they were part of the IFC when the questions were being asked and being deliberated and never... I mean, that docket packs said this morning.  We spoke about why did this happen, why was it necessary.  Nowhere in that discussion did any of the management say     But Chairperson, my understanding always was.  A company in distress, in need of money, the need of money urgently.  And that is why we signed it within less than 24-hours.  Nowhere in the deliberation was it about not going to ever to OCH.     Chairperson, I completely agree with you except for the one point.     That who is it made, who is it made to?     The who is it made to part, is the part which is quite coming for me in terms of the wording.     Remember we as a board now know about OCH being in business rescue.     We also know now that they are engaging with a whole range of people we do not know who.     So my understanding, which is why I was – I really wanted ...[indistinct - distorted].  Is this something that would typically happen?  Is this something that could happen?  And I am not satisfied there was.  The who it was made to, in my mind – I cannot talk for anybody else – business rescuers typically would go out and deal with a whole range of people, so I didn’t see that as being strange at all.     So you’re ...[intervenes]      I totally agree with you Chairperson.     Chairperson, I completely concede with what you have said.  I just want to add that from my perspective – and it is not a defence, this is where my mind is.     That is all I can talk – I cannot talk for the other board members.     We have got a company in distress in business rescue.  My understanding with that means that the business rescue practitioner is interacting with our organisation.  What they have got and who they are doing that with is not who I – I do not know because that is not what has been put in front of me.  Which is – I go back to the wording, I concede with what you say, I do concede, the point I am making is, in my mind, I do not know who those people are and if I could have asked more questions at the time because what I know now, I would never have agreed(?).     I hear you, Chairperson, and like I said, I concede with your position.  I, like I said, cannot answer for anybody else.     I can just talk for myself and my position then.  If this was not a business rescue transaction then that would have been a very – then I would immediately have [indistinct].  I guess from my perspective, so what I understood it at the time was that because they are in business rescue they are talking to a whole lot of people and maybe this is okay.  So I cannot argue with what you are saying, Chairperson, other than that was my position for supporting it ultimately which obviously now I know was wrong.       I wish I knew then what I know now.     Chairperson, like I said to you, I think – I heard your question and I reckon it probably would have, the same sentiments would have applied but remember at the time when that came to us, it was not seen as a matter of urgency we were told that this contract runs until 2018 and my understanding was if this was really a case of, you know, they can go out of business tomorrow, out of – ja, tomorrow, that we would have – that I certainly would have paid more attention to it.  At the time there was not as much of a rush to sign anything off.     Chairperson, to respond to you, that was the reason – I cannot talk for Ms Naidoo but I can talk for me finding subject to IFC approval, I needed to understand, you know, is this a done thing?  This is a lot of money they are wanting us to commit to, why do we need to do it immediately and I say Dr [indistinct] gave me comfort in his explanation based on his many years of working for Eskom and knowing the organisation better than anyone else.     Chairperson, I cannot answer that for you, I cannot tell you for sure that that is the question that was asked of the executive.  I remember requesting an IFC and I hear another board member also did and that was - you know, was discussed as per the minutes.  I do not remember asking executives why this was such an urgent thing.  I wanted to hear that from a follow board member who had worked at Eskom and understood the running and mechanics of Eskom better than certainly than I did.     I hear you, Chairperson, I really – I cannot really comment on that.     Like you pointed – sorry, Chairperson.     I said like you correctly pointed out, at that time it was not top of mind for me.  I had been in a board meeting in April where it was brought in for discussion, it was referred back to the CEO.  As you have correctly pointed out it was not even presented, it was taken as read, so this was not top of mind for me.     That this was something that is in business rescue until it arrived on the 1 s t – or sorry, the date in December.  So, you know, it is not something that I could have argued at the time because it was not top of mind.  So you say to me now it should have been mind, the reality now, now I realise it should have been but it was not at that stage.     I heard you, Chairperson.     Chairperson, can I maybe respond.     I am sorry, advocate, can I maybe respond?     I understand that we are sitting in an organisation which was in dire straits just months before that with load shedding.  We are being guided by executives, when they say to you they need something signed tomorrow, I mean, it is not for me as a board member to come and say but hold on, guys, you know, we are not going to sign this.  I mean, urgency was something that I took very, very seriously.  If management comes and says something is urgent, then it is urgent, which is why I called – phoned the IFC and as you correctly say, you know, Ms Naidoo also wrote about that, and I wanted an explanation before I signed, Dr Naidoo, you’re working for this organisation for more than 30 years, tell me what this is what we are signing.  Why is this urgent?   So, Chairperson, I am not sure if that that answers your question about the fact that he did not say it was urgent, I was guided by the fact that I am asked to sign for something within less than 24 hours and that is what I was responding to.     Chairperson, I hear you completely, I just want to put it on record that I considered it to be urgent after hearing from somebody who works at Eskom for 30 years.     That this was…     But I hear you.     I should have maybe asked more questions,  but – ja.     No, no, he did not, Chairperson, but I – let me put to you, and maybe incorrectly so, the mere fact that the ISP was arranged so urgently gave me comfort that this thing is what it said it was and maybe, you know, a lot of what is coming today, one stands back and say, you know, I should have asked more and I should have done.  Just a pity I did not know more at that stage about what was really happening, clearly behind the scene.     Chairperson, if I knew about that I would not have signed this.  I was not aware of that.     No, Chairperson, I would only have received the information as per the board packs, nobody ever discussed it with me.  Maybe – I do not know, maybe your BTC members would have been warned, you know, I cannot respond that, I [indistinct] of that including the legal opinion which obviously did not come to me.     Certainly not, Chairperson, it has all become part of, you know, the investigations and things but the board – well, I cannot talk for the board, I certainly was not aware.     Certainly not and just so that – just to remind you that load shedding had stopped, if I remember correctly, either August or September of that year.  So we would not – I mean, once something like that – and we could say in terms of quantum, it is huge, which it is, but remember, we are talking about a company with R175 billion turnover, we were brought a lot of big transactions to sign and once it was signed off it would have been ratified – obviously, the resolution would be ratified at the next board meeting but we had been rapped over the knuckles how many times for becoming operational.  So to answer the question, I would not have gone back and asked.  I satisfied myself at the time, rightfully or wrongfully so, that that was what was required for the business but I would certainly not have gone and done a follow-up, there was just too much going on.     Yes, Chairperson, he was there.     He was there, he definitely was.     Chairperson, all I can say to you, you know, with the benefit of hindsight, I am actually perplexed that what I believed I signed was something completely different.  I would be keen and I actually [indistinct] to see what the guarantee that was issued to the bank actually looked like and how that compares with what we were given as a board.     Yes Chairperson, I must tell you when I followed this discussion it just made me feel like I should have run away from Eskom long before I actually did.     400?     No Chairperson I don’t.   I have no knowledge of that.      Ja, from what I remember they never did.       I think that has come out recently Chairperson yes.   I am not talking – it is not in my affidavit but I am talking to what I can remember.     No Chairman.     I’m hearing it now, I am not aware of this.     Chairperson from what I remember a submission was made to the Board for us to sign off like R100 000 for McKinsey.  At the beginning of the – when it was put on the table I actually asked to be recused because I am a management consultant, when I left ABSA in 2010 and started my own company, Klein Management Consultants, I was obviously being in touch with various consulting firms, so they obviously get the lion share of the work when it comes to Banks, so I spoke to Deloittes, KPMG, McKinsey, as well as ...[indistinct – distorted], so when I saw something on the table from McKinsey I immediately asked to be recused, I said guys I am in discussions where I may get a piece of work from McKinsey so I did not want to be part of the discussion. At that stage I was asked you know what is the detail of the work and I explained look I am a retired banker and they saw that I was obviously engaging to see could I require an opportunity that worked in the different banks, but I think what complicated matters for me was that I went onto the Board of Reserve Bank in August so the work that they had planned for me to do could not happen in South Africa, it wouldn’t have – it would have been in the rest of Africa.  That is the reason I put up my hand and said look I don’t want to be part of any McKinsey discussion because I made – that is the wording is the possibility of a conflict. Does that answer the question Chairperson?     Sorry okay, ask again.     I’m sorry Chair.   Okay, can I try and answer it for you Chairperson if it wasn’t that question.     ...[Indistinct – distorted]     Please do, please do.     That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct and I apologise, for ja, that is exactly what I said yes.     I believe so and if memory serves me well I think it was signed with the Chairperson at the time being Dr Ben, I think so, I am not ... ja.     Well remember at the time I was not aware that had already gone, the sole-sourcing agreement had already been signed.   My understanding was that we were signing off for McKinsey to help us with the Corporate plan and the reason I didn’t think there was anything wrong with that is because previously, the previous Board also had help in getting the Corporate plan effected to sign off all levels and it goes into the public domain.     Sorry, maybe I didn’t get the question right Chairperson, can you just then ask the question – was I aware of the sole-sourcing agreement in paragraph 8, is that the question?     No I was not aware.     No I was not aware Chairperson.     Okay.  I apologise Chairperson.     Absolutely.     That is correct. ADV SELEKA     Yes I  - ja I think the first part of that sentence actually quotes me where I said I wanted to be recused because there could be a potential conflict of interest, like I explained I was looking to do a piece of work for them in the banking system in South Africa, but then I went onto the Board of the Reserve Bank in August of that year which is why I could not then carry on doing the work, so we were talking at that stage about me doing a piece of work in the financial services sector outside of South Africa.  I had never done any work for McKinsey, we were still busy negotiating at that stage.     Sorry, sorry Chairperson?     Yes it was on the 10 t h of September, I think that was the date, ja the 10 t h of September.     Are you asking for me to – sorry.  Right let me     But what I am saying to you is ...[intervenes]       I don’t have the page, I don’t have that in front of me, I am reading it from the screen, remember you sent me everything in digital form ...[intervenes]      Chairperson what I am saying is I received it in digital form, but I cannot give you a page reference.     Ja, it says – do you want me to read it Chairperson?     It says    That is what the minute says Chair.     I am saying I [inaudible – no sound] no, the first part of it is the possible conflict of interest is correct, the ...[indistinct] is absolutely not correct because I did not do any work for McKinsey for which I was paid.     I wanted to recuse myself but after explaining like I did to you earlier that is what they – possible work in the financial – not possible – work in the financial services sector which was originally going to be in South Africa but when I went onto the Board of the Reserve Bank in August of 2015 the discussion with McKinsey became doing work for them in the rest of Africa, when the Board heard that they were comfortable that there was no conflict of interest and asked me not to recuse myself.     No, I have never done work with McKinsey.     That is correct Chairperson.     Yes, yes, I can hear you.     I do Chairperson.    Correct, that is correct Chairperson.     Correct Chairperson.     I do.     That is correct Chairperson, I do.     Thank you very much Chairperson. 
VENETE JARLENE KLEIN:   [duly sworn, states] 
ADV DON MAHON:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Advocate Don Mahon instructed by ...[indistinct] attorneys. 
MS NAIDOO:  My apologies.    Devapushpum Naidoo.    No.    I do.    So help me God.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I do.    Correct.    Yes I do Chair.    Sorry Chair what did you say?    What did you say?  You may call me Viroshni it is my calling name.  I know it is a mouthful.    Viroshni yes.    Sorry Chair what was the supplementary    Oh okay my apologies. ADV SELEKA    Correct that is my signature.    Yes.    February.  Oh sorry.    Advocate Seleka may I please draw the attention of the commission to two amendments in my affidavit?    So on page what is that?  Page 2 paragraph 4 my articles was not 93/94 that is 95 and 96.     Yes correct.    And then on page…    Page 2.  On page 2 paragraph 4 the year of my articles was 95/96.    RC     95 to 1996.    To 1996.    1993 should be 1995.    And 1994 should read 1996.    1996.    Yes it was two years that I did…    Correct yes.    Yes correct.    Yes so that should read High Court in 1997 when I was a …    Yes correct.    Should read 1997 yes.    And then the next one I would like to draw the commission’s attention to is on page 2 paragraph 19.3.4 it    Oh it is my apologies.    So in your version…    So it would read   Correct.    So it will read 19 – paragraph 19.34.    Yes so that should actually be 16 February – ah no the 17 February it was not a board induction it was a meeting – it was a board meeting.    You should delete induction and put in meeting.      Okay.    Okay Chair. Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    14.    Chair I am an admitted attorney. I did ten years of private practice thereafter I moved to Johannesburg and I joined corporate.  I climbed the corporate ladder as they say.  I worked for Telkom, Bytes Technology, American Tower and Impact Limited.  Around 2014 I applied for the board position at Eskom and I was appointed I think it is the 12t h of December 2014.    Oh no I think it was 12 I got the date yes.     Yes correct.    Correct.    Yes.    I try – I traded for a very short period of time it was for a period of about two years.    Oh sorry Chair.      It was for about two years so it may have ended in 2002 ja.    Africa 00   Correct.    I think it was just an error.    Well perhaps your question in terms of…    Sorry Chair.    On page?    I am – I – it was probably an error but either it could have also been in terms of the question that …    So the questions that the commission had sent it was in terms of what we had done prior to being appointed.  So maybe that is why I specified all the jobs that I had.  This one I was appointed 2015 when I was already an Eskom board member.    Oh.    My apologies Chair.    Yes.    Chair I think it was an error alternatively it could have been my answer in terms of the questions that were sent to me by the commission in terms of what roles I held prior to joining Eskom.      So Albertime is an investment company and a consulting business and I joined…    Nothing Chair I think it was just an error because I am the one who inserted my CV with you know all my details of my employment.    If I  - I cannot recall the exact question but I know the questions was in terms of what positions we had, what degrees and qualifications. And maybe my understanding was before I joined Eskom.  So that is why I stipulated the employment prior to joining Eskom.    But – but as I said it was just an error because I attached my CV.    It is an investment and a consulting company.  I was employed by Albertime but Albertime had business relations with a debt collection business in the intention of me joining was to work with the debt collection business.  But I did not work directly with Albertime I worked actually in the debt collection area of the business.    It is my husband’s company.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Not in 2015; 2016 yes.    So in 2016 there were various articles in January concerning Mr Zwane and Tegeta and OCM and what you have addressed with Ms Klein the particular visit to Switzerland and therefore I was very concerned and – sorry Chair I should be speaking to you.  I then wrote to Eskom and I said that my husband is an advisor to Minister Zwane and I do not think I should be involved in any tenders where we award contracts to any mining companies.  And so from that period I was excused.      It was for OCM.   So are you asking what transactions happened while I was – during that period?    In January there was articles with Minister Zwane making his trip to Switzerland.    I did not tell them in a meeting I wrote to the company secretary around January and I said I – you know I think – at first I did not think that there was a conflict because we are very different enterprises but after that article and there was so much involvement I felt I should not be involved in any transactions leading to mining companies.    So then the…    Yes so the first tender meeting for February I excused myself when they awarded contracts for mining companies and I know one of those specific companies was OCM.  Then in March I brought it to their attention again but they were not appointing any tenders in the March meeting they were only doing strategies.  The board deliberated and said I could attend that meeting or should I say continue in all the transactions which I did.    The board deliberated but they respected my exclusion or wanting to be you know excluded from those meetings so it was agreed that I will be allowed to.    I did not really see a conflict as such because it is not like we were discussing what we were both doing.  There was no sort of interaction or association in terms what the Department of Minerals and Energy was doing together with what Eskom was doing.  Even I will be honest with you when that matter for the pre-purchase came to me I did not for one second believe there could be a conflict.  But however in January when I saw there were the articles about Minister Zwane being involved with the company that you know was dealing with Eskom I was very uncomfortable and I felt you know I should actually excuse myself.    Correct.    No.    No.    No.    Chair around end of 2014 I started applying for board positions and I applied for the Eskom board position and then I was contacted by a Ms Rothnam who advised me that you know I had been nominated and do I accept the position.  After deliberation I did.    No I have served on other corporate boards – commercial boards.    No, no.    There was an article in the newspaper.    It is applying for an Eskom board position.    So there were quite a few I had applied for quite a few.    Accident fund board.    It was an advertisement for the board position.    Yes.    Yes.    I knew Mr Mark Pamensky and I knew of Mr Zethembe Khoza because I was at Telkom and he was also at Telkom.    Social perspective.  We attended very similar functions.    Yes.    Correct.    No.    Yes.    Correct he was an Executive at Telkom.    No.    No.    No I do not know them and I have never met them.    Yes.  I know Mr Salim Essa.    Correct, yes.    He is known to my husband.  I do not know him personally so I would not consider him my friend.    But my husband knows him so that is how I know him.  As I said in my affidavit and I took the guidance from your affidavit you know exactly times I had met him.  Ja and the last meeting was in 2015 I think it was at a wedding and we sat at the same table.    Correct.    Yes.    No.    Not when I was at Eskom no they have not done any business together.  I do not think they have done any business together.    No, no.    Well more like associates yes.    Correct.    Mr Essa?    They were mostly at gatherings.  I think there were more than 100 people at all three of the gatherings – there were three gatherings.  I have not met him on a personal basis to discuss any Eskom matters or my business relations.  I have never had coffee with him but I have never interacted with him on a social basis one and one.  So he is known to my husband he is not my friend.    No.    No.    No I – I have not discussed my appointments or my job you know with my husband.  I am very independent.  It is quite offensive when somebody says to you got to your husband.    I have not discussed with my husband you know my employment or where I am planning to go if I am applying for a new position.  I have never done that.    No why?    No I…    If I got ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Well, what I was trying to say to you that if I wanted to apply for a new job, I would not go to him and ask him or tell him or whatever.  If I did get a new appointment, yes, of course, I would tell him that I got a new appointment but I would have already accepted it. I never really addressed that with him.  To be honest, I think it was one of my head of legal positions     But in terms, I only have an agent and my agent would normally refer me to different jobs and then I go for the interview and things like that.  So if it means I got the letter of appointment, then I would call and tell him.     Yes, yes.  But I not like I would not ask him    Yes, of course.  Yes.  My job towards – you know as it is on photo 2, it was in and around my children.  As my kids got older, I started – if you have noticed, I worked in a job from Pretoria.  Then I started moving closer to my home.  And that is why I reflected on taking board positions because I did – I thought it would allow me to have a bit more time as opposed to the 12-hour job.  Ja.  So.     Yes, I think so.  At a function, at a – what is it?  It was an ANN7 thing.  My husband got invited and I think mister...  If I recall, Mr Pamensky was also there.  But this was while I was an Eskom board member.     My husband was invited by Mr Zwane.     But I could be mistaken.  Ja.     Yes, it was their award function.     It was the news channel.     Tegeta.     One of those companies, yes.     I was not asked the question.  I put that in my statement because that was what ...[intervenes]      ...in the Public Protector ’s report.  The Public Protector ’s report came out in November.  Ms Thuli Madonsela’s last day, if I recall, was the Friday, the 12 t h of October. The day before that I was contacted by Eskom at     My husband has told me no.  I have met with his accountant and auditor and they have proven to me no.  I have done this numerous times to numerous journalists.  I have written to the press about that.  I have tried to – I did write to the Public Protector but she had already left.     And the new one could not address the matter because she said the matter was closed.  She could not deal with it anymore.  So yes I have tried to deal with this aspect for a very long time.     And I have lived with four years now.  And Advocate Seleka, my husband’s company did not contribute to Tegeta.     Yes.     And I have also verified by visiting his accountants and they have provided me proof.       [No audible reply]  ADV SELEKA     Correct.  I gave you ...[intervenes]      Yes.     So if I ...[intervenes]      Correct, yes.  Seven-fifty to a billion or ...[indistinct] BTC.     My apologies.       So the BTC threshold is R 750 million to a billion.     Yes, correct.     Correct.  And ...[intervenes]      Correct.  And then from one billion to 1.5, its board and thereafter it has got to the Department of Public Enterprises.     Ja.     Yes, I was.     Yes, we were.     No.  So it is important to understand why we were in Cape Town.  We were presenting to the Parliament – it was our first meeting where the board was presenting to Parliament and then we also presented to the Ministers.  So the day after we had this board meeting.  I think we were there for two days Chair.  So basically all of us were there.       Sorry.  We were in Cape Town for two days.     Oh, I will be corrected who they were.  I am sorry but I assumed we were all there.     No.     So let me give an insight into what transpired.     I know you have addressed this with Ms Klein.     That we had basically on that day ratified Mr Molefe’s secondment.       Sorry?     Yes, correct.  But you must remember.  Even though we did that, that was a formality.  It actually started a few days before.  What day – do you know what date – what kind of a day was it?  Was it a Tuesday or a Wednesday?   Because I remember we all met on a Sunday and we met with Mr Molefe because we were preparing for Parliament.  It was the first we were going.  He was very new and we all had to discuss the questions they were going to put to us.   And there were lots of very stringent questions.  And if the Commission wants, I can tell the questions together with the answers because one of the questions Ms Mzo put to us was the issues concerning the War Room and the fact that incorrect information was going to the War Room and in that minutes that is being reflected. So that meeting then stopped.  We had this particular day where we were preparing on the Sunday.  Then I think the next day or the day after, we flew to Cape Town.  We spent at Parliament.  And then the following day we had a board meeting.   And it was a very introductory one where the Minister, you know, got to meet all of us properly and then we met Brian again for the second time.  And then obviously – it was sort of a very informal board meeting.     Yes.  It was not like we had a list of items we read through it and whatever.     It was very informal.  It was very last minute.     Sorry?     Uhm ...[intervenes]      No, I do not think it was.     Yes, I do.     Okay.  So it was – so the matter came before us.  It was for the extension of the – no, it was for the amendment of the agreement.  They currently had an agreement but they were requesting from Eskom an increase in the price.   There was also a clause in relation to the extension.  That was addressed with us. It was a fairly large extension.  It was, I think, for an additional 20 years. The contract was going to expire in 2018 but Eskom was looking at another 20 years for the life of the mine but I remember the submission said that the life of the mine was under the 20-years but it could be extended to accommodate the OCM deal. The matter was – they were paying R 150,00 a ton and it was going to increase to R 442,00 until the end of 16 and from there to 2018, I think it was going to go to R 472,00.  I could be mistaken but after 2018 it was going to go to R 472.00.     So when we started – because it was such a huge amount in the sense that it was a big jump.  It was an extra 200% mark-up.  I mean, you were going from what?  R 300 million a year to R 3.5 billion.  You are looking at an R 60 billion contract.   It kind of triggered – it was – we were in a financial strain.  We were not – we were a growing concern issue during this time and we were not in a situation to commit ourselves. I do also remember and I know tried to go back to the BTC minute.  I was not a BTC member at that stage.  But I think one of the reasons they then pushed to the board was because it was above their threshold.  Oh, no, no.  Sorry.  It was out of their budget.     Out of the budget.  So you must remember, you have every year a coal budget.     No, the budget within Eskom for coal.     Yes.  So that was the reasoning why I think it is mentioned of the minutes of the BTC that the matter must go to the board.  So there were various questions put to management.   Remember, Advocate Seleka.  Every matter that is presented to the board or the Board Tender Committee is presented by CV’s or the level of management. So for example, Eskom has got almost 42 tender committees below the board level, Board Tender Committee.  Directly below us we have ESCOs which is an executive committee consisting of the executives. Their threshold is R 300 million to R 750 million.  They then will rectify, go through the submission and they submit it to the board tender and from there or alternatively either to the board. So it is very likely that we got this from either ESCOs or senior management and there were lots of questions put to the board.  I mean, put by the board.  And there were very few answers that could be answered. Mr Brian Molefe, on the Sunday I recall was very impressive.  I mean, he was there two days but he was so well-glued up on the business.  Even if you go back and you look at the minutes for that parliamentary thing, he answered most of the questions.     So we were very confident ...[intervenes]      He answered most of the questions that the parliamentarians put towards the board.     Mr Brian Molefe.     So on that day, on the 23 r d ...[intervenes]      Yes, I am coming to that.       Correct.  He was there for three days.     Maybe the day before when we went to Parliament.  Because you see, on the Sunday before we prepared, we all got together, together with him and we went obviously through the financials, the possibility of what questions would be put to us.   And the thing is, you must be prepared irrespective of the fact that the man is there every job.  He knew he had to deliver.  And he – so we all prepared together, the board members and him and we were there with the senior managers as well as the executives. Then the next – when we arrived in Cape Town, I think our first thing – we arrived the night before, the next day we all went to Parliament. The questions were put to us.  We answered it.  He answered the majority of the questions.  I am sure the minutes will reflect that.  And then the next day we had a board meeting.   He came across very confident and he was very authoritative in the sense that he knew what he was doing.  So when we started putting questions to management, he could not answer them, obviously, because he was also – he did not know much about the matter.     Let us give him to address the matter and come back to us.     The questions I think were related in terms of what ...[intervenes]      In terms of how did I ask the question?     No, no.  We had a discussion ...[intervenes]      Yes, yes, yes, yes.     Yes.  So with due – Advocate Seleka, as I have said to you.     There is a form of management that will submit to us, a tender.  So there would have been a line of managers or an executive.  Actually, an executive has to present or be present on a particular tender if it is in relation to these aspects.  So I cannot verify exactly who the executive was.     No, I ...[intervenes]      I recall asking questions.  We would not have asked it to board members.  That does not seem right.  Our board members ...[intervenes]      ...be able to answer on a particular matter.     We could have addressed issues maybe to board tender but management would have definitely had to be there to present a board matter.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     I disagree the fact that there could have been no managers at this meeting.     Because they would have had to join us when we went to Parliament and we had certain managers or executives.  So the executives were definitely all there.  Are you talking about managers like Mr Johan Bester or are you excluding executive members?     Am I supposed to...     Oh, okay.       Eskom Bundle 12?     Ja.  What page?     241?     Oh, yes I have got it.     Ja.     Yes, I do.     [No audible reply]      I find it very difficult to understand.  Then who were the questions addressed to?     You understand?     It is very likely that it could have been...       So, I – honestly, we did have a discussion on the Sunday.     We could not have made a decision without asking questions, you know.     But I want to reverse the question to members of the executive or the CEO that was present and that is very likely why we addressed the matter to him or referred it to him.     I think the intention was for him to provide more information.     That was very clear.     I remember one of the robust things was that during or prior to this particular meeting, we were constantly told about the so-called cost coal mines and how we were investing all this money. And at the beginning of every year, we would give them their budget and thereafter we would also pay for the coal which did not make sense because you did not own these mines, they were owned by other parties but you like basically running them.  It was like sort of a neck lease.   And we had an issue with that.  So when this matter came to us, it was like as if we were told now you need to increase this, pay more money, you do not have to budget.  So how you care going to deal with it.     So go and get us more information.  And one of the things that we discussed.     Was if this company is having difficulty, can Eskom then not take a shareholding in the company, not anybody else, Eskom so that Eskom can use the coal that it needs and thereafter sell or export the coal that it does not need because you are already doing that for the cost plus mine. And if you look at the minutes that is reflected and it says then the matter was referred to Mr Molefe for further information.  That was it.  As simple as that.     There was no malice or there were ...[intervenes]      ...a Public Protector indicated... [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     ...like a strategy.  You know as Dr Ben said.     That was the furthest thing from our minds.     And in the submission itself was intense.     Yes.     Yes.  The minutes is clear.     For him to get us more information.     Correct.     No.     Okay so what transpired is that.  I did not know – the matter never came back to the board.  We had various board meetings thereafter.  When the Commission is now sending me questions as to whether Mr Molefe reported this matter ...[intervenes]      Yes, in November.  You guys sent me questions for the first time ...[intervenes]      ...on the 9 t h of November.     So I then started going through all the minutes again and I picked up on the minutes of the  t h of September, there is a submission for a CEO’s report.  And in the CEO’s report he talked about this particular transaction and that he had, I think, cancelled or I do not know the exact details.     But he advises that the negotiations had stopped or something like that.       Yes.  So let me explain to you what happened over there.  The 10 t h ...[intervenes]      On the 9 t h of  - or the 10 t h of September where I picked it up that there was mention ...[intervenes]      Chair, I have waited for yours to sit on this chair.     You understand?     Sorry, what page did you say?     Yes?     Okay I am here.     [No audible reply]      Correct.     No, the current.  So the agreement was in 18.     Yes, correct there was a current agreement.     [No audible reply]      It would have meant a new agreement.     Because remember, they come to you for an addendum.     Okay.  So perhaps ...[intervenes]      Yes, the amendment on the increase.     Oh, okay.  Oh, sorry.  You are right.     Yes.     Yes, you are right.  You are right.     Yes, you are right.     You are right.     No, you are right, Chair.     I would mean a new agreement, correct.     Include that.     No, no, so basically I do not recall the matter coming back to me to say that he terminated because I think that was the question.     Did he come back to say to us that he terminated and no that  …[intervenes]     Correct.     Correct, Chair.     No.     Correct.     In the Public Protector ’s… ADV SELEKA     Correct.     Correct.     ’16.     Which legal?     Oh yes, it is in my submission.     Yes, it is, it is actually the very next page.     Yes, correct.     Yes, so on your questions, when you asked me...     I had to go through all my minutes.     Because I did not want to miss something and then Advocate Seleka cross-questions me.  So when I went through everything I noticed on the 10 September minutes there was a submission and the CEO’s report had this report about OCM.     So I went – that was in the submission papers, then I went to look at the minutes.  The minutes says the CEO’s report is noted, the board members got it late, they have not read it- I am not sure exactly not read it, but the impression is implied...     That we have not read it.  We can go back, read it and then revert to him.       To be honest with you, Chair, that was a two day breakaway.  I did not go back and read his reports, you know?  And let me tell you how that meeting originated, the …[intervenes]     Sorry.     Sorry.     Adv Seleka, a very transactional matters actually came to the board and in hindsight – I hate using that word but it is truthful in the sense that the matters that did go to the board, even below our threshold, seems to be all the matters in contention that we are sitting and discussing now.  So what happened on the 23 April, it would have been an action item and it should have invariably been called up at the next meeting because it automatically gets.  I was not the Chair of the board so I can really not explain as to why this matter was not.  I was the Chair of bills and recovery, so I understood the process that it was my responsibility and duty to make sure that I go through these minutes, tabulate the action items and make sure that it goes to the next meeting.  I really cannot explain this to you.  Then I think sometime in about June/July I got appointed to BTC, so that was the very first time transactional matters starting coming to me but prior to that I do not recall very – or any matters coming to me, this may have been one isolated matter and from there, between that period to June/July we were dealing with Denton’s, we were dealing with the executives, we were dealing with the going-concern crisis, the last thing would have been a transactional issue and I would have had to have some sort of interest in this matter for me to go back and say but I am waiting for you to come back with a reply, it is an operational matter, we gave it to the CEO and we left it with him. I do even recall the September meeting, or I could be mistaken, or August, where it came to the board that we were being too operational and that we need to step back and let the executives do their job.      And that is minuted.     And I correct that at parliament.     So I can clearly understand why it was – but I cannot answer for Dr Dan, he was the Chair at that time.     No.     No.     Correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes. ADV SELEKA     Sorry, Chair.     Yes.     No.     I think that is such an unfair comment on the basis that when this matter came to us on the 23 April, you are asking me for a 200% increase, you are asking me to write up a R2.1 billion penalty, you are asking me to extend I think for another 25 years and I was the Chair of – I was not the Chair, I was member of bills and recovery and I remember that went to the life of mines would be, so I understood that you could never enter into a contract with a particular company over the life of mine and this particular submission it says that you would need this extra 25 years to mine, I think it was five years left, but it is very likely we can extend it but there is no answer telling me how you are going to extent if the mine is going to expire five years earlier.  So we made a logical [indistinct] from an economical perspective to say no, sorry, we need more information.  There was absolutely no malice or intention to push back on it and play into the hands of Mr Essa or Mr Molefe in terms of what you have implied.     Because, Adv Seleka, there has been so many issues on the penalty with Tegeta and the reduction and I know certain board members are being sued.  Imagine if I had agreed to write up R2.1 billion the 23 April, I would be sued.  So let us be fair to this board.  On what was presented to us was not fair, it was not the right submission, it was not the right situation for Eskom and I still stand by that.     Correct.     Correct.     Yes, but I take that value of the reserving of a right very seriously.,      You know, there are legal implications.     There were legal implications to that if Eskom committed to it in advance because then it would have meant that Eskom would have had to negotiate or at least give them an opportunity to negotiate in terms of [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Oh, sorry, Chair.     The right was referred to a price, it was linked to a price and the price was still R475 …[intervenes]     520.  So it was a right that went further.     That about 20 …[intervenes]     So basically Eskom had agreement with them for 18, they were negotiating or looking at extending it for another 10 years.  Correct?  10 years.  But the intention was to actually get – reserve a right for another 25 years but …[intervenes]     Correct.      I do not remember any …[intervenes]     I do not remember all of it but I know there was a price attached to it.     Correct.     But then you are …[intervenes]     So the reservation of the right had attached to it a price, a price that was far higher than the 150.  It was even higher than the 442.  So for me …[intervenes]     I do not know the exact figure.     So my understanding would be that if I commit now, at a later …[intervenes]     Correct.     A few years later down the line Eskom management would take that right on and continue to supply them at this increased price as opposed to benchmarking at that stage whether that was the right price.  So I was not in favour of the long term agreement or the commitment, as such, I would have preferred a shorter agreement of 10 years or shorter and then benchmark in terms of what was the current economic situation at that stage. I just felt it was too much of a commitment on the likes of the mine.     If I recall, the submission was based on the fact that OCM was now in business rescue, the business rescue …[intervenes]     Sorry, Chair.     The company was now in business rescue, there were discussions with the business rescue practitioner and at the time when the submission had come to us, by that stage there was no final decision made by the business rescue practitioner in terms of a commitment.  I think there was a clause that said that the business rescue practitioner had at the previous meeting said that they would continue with the agreement or they would remove the company out of the business rescue process but there was no commitment.  Then there was indication that one of the particular mines, I think it is Koperfontein(?) that was being supplied by OCM, that agreement was coming to an end in January 2016 which would have been the following month.  So there was a sense of insecurity in terms of coal for the particular power station and therefore, this pre-purchase was coming to us to have a commitment and a security of coal.  So my understanding of Eskom’s business is that one of our basic assets is our coal stockpile.  Without that you can never – you cannot practice, you cannot deliver on your strategy, so you needed to ensure that you had constantly sufficient coal.  You do not buy it on an ad hoc basis you buy it on a long term plan.     So the understanding was at that stage there was a lack of commitment from this company because of their financial implications and that this particular pre-purchase will give you a commitment where we could now have the coal, because it is already available, it is on stockpile, by pre-purchasing the coal basically be [indistinct].     So that was my understanding.     OCM.  I have put that in my affidavit.  And, Judge, to the question that you put to Ms Klein about whether we noticed the proposed owner.  To be – I am going to be very honest with you, I did not.  I have looked at it a hundred times since then as to who could I have missed that word and I can only explain the reasoning behind the heading that it said a pre-purchase to OCM.  Throughout the submission they talk about the proposed purchaser, so obviously my understanding is the proposed purchaser is somebody that will want to buy but in terms – they never referred to a proposed owner throughout the submission where they talk about it.  So I am going to be absolutely honest with you, I did not notice.     Is how it makes sense.     Yes, I totally accept that.     Of course.     Yes.     Yes.     Correct.     Chair, if I had noticed that, the first question would have been who are the proposed owner, so I can definitely tell you because of the heading said pre-purchase to OCM, that stuck in my head, not that I am not trying to find an excuse for what I did in terms of not realising proposed order, but I did send questions to Ms Daniels on this matter, she did not mention my questions, she did mention that I’d you know signed off on the matter and then I said refer it to IFC.  I did ask her the two questions was from the current agreement – can I refer you to the other?    Yes, from the current documents, does not mean we buying coal at the price in terms of our current agreement and the person that has applied was either Mr Matshela Koko or Anoj Singh…[intervene]     Oh, so the either two executives that replied was Mr Anoj Singh or Matshela Koko because she has got that on the email, she has got Anoj/ Matshela and they say confirmed.  The coal price is asked to the current coal supply agreement with OCM.  So I am being told this, then I said further advice if there is any other means of getting coal elsewhere and this is no other means of getting coal for him at a price of R150,00 per ton, the open inquiry for the smoke coal qualities for Arnot power station has not yielded positive results.  So I think when I got this, you know, the first impression was that this is coming from OCM.  So it has to be OCM.  The price is now R150,00 as opposed to the 442 they were asking in April and that was what I thought was the right decision for Eskom and that is why I do not come back on that but it still does not take away that I did not…[intervene]     But with due respect Chair.     But I think we were all thinking on the same line.  That is why I eventually, I think they were all thinking on the same lines.  That is why I see…[intervene]     Because it is seen as a round robin the night before you are given a few hours.     It is the urgency of the matter and the fact that it was not at a meeting, so it was no discussion.     No because - well, I can tell you I did not.     I cannot answer for other members but for me personally because I was already in tenure for about four months, everything at Eskom was very urgent and it had to be dealt with immediately.  I mean you would see from my affidavit, I gave you lots of examples where we had round robins for hundreds of millions of rands, and they had to be dealt with overnight or as a round robin.     The perception is that it is true.     It was not played out that way.  You were told that if you do not do this, we go into load shedding.     Management, management is operational we are not operational.     Yes, we dealt with urgent matters urgently, we did not push back that is true.  But with due respect Judge this was never signed off to OCM, I mean to Tegeta. This was signed off to OCM, IFC signed this to OCM.     But eventually IFC held a meeting and it was agreed OCM.     With due respect Judge I am not blaming them, I think was the drafter was very clever.  The drafter was extremely clever to make the heading OCM. talk about OCM, talk about proposed purchaser and then in one clause talk about the proposed order, but yes I do accept.     Correct.  I do accept that was an oversight on my part.      Yes, but things changed in December they were in business rescue, they were not in business rescue on the 23 r d of April.     Yes.     So what my understanding was that there was a lack of commitment on the coal supply.      And for me they needed a commitment from this particular company that they were going to supply so much of coal at a certain price.  And with due respect, Advocate Seleka business rescue is not the ideal situation for any company.  So when I am being told that this company is business rescue, they have agreed that they will continue with the agreement but as of the date of the submission, there is no final commitment.  But here is a proposal being put forward by the business rescue practitioner on the pre-purchase for R150 a ton, as opposed to the 442million, I definitely saw it as a better deal for Eskom.     Oh.     There is the difference Chair because in April 23 r d when it came, there was an increase.  Yeah, it is a continuation of an existing agreement at the same price and you have been told that you will now save I think it was like R215million on the basis that you are getting it at the same price because you would address, I think it was the working capital.  So my understanding was that if you budgeted R100,00 per month going forward, if you pre-paid that same R100,00 or R20,00 out of that R100,00 in December the following month you will only be incurring R80,00.  So it is not like you are taking money out of your budget because you have already committed to this particular budget at this price but I thought it was a good deal.     Yes, but then the submission says as of the date of the submission they had not got a commitment.  So it does give you these two clauses, giving you the impression that they have made these promises but they have not committed to it and we are now in the situation.  So my understanding at the time was that there is no final commitment and this is what now they are committing to and yes sign a deal.     No, there is no date, the way it is drafted it gives you the impression that you had these initial meetings and then nothing transpired.  And then you are at the situation now where you have not heard from them and everybody's quiet.  So I am hearing obviously the dates for the first time.  I can only tell you what was in the submission.     No. ADV SELEKA     No.     The Board did not do that, if that was the intention of management or executive it was not the intention of the Board.  Chair, Advocate Seleka lead evidence with Ms Daniel, I think it was with Ms Daniel concerning correspondence between Mr Singh and I think it is Eric Wood.     Concerning…[intervene]     Yes, it was concerning the submission document.      Yes and they did not want the submission to go to IFC, they did not want it go to the DPE.  Advocate Seleka my letter to Ms Daniels on the 9 t h or the 8 t h of September was exactly in contradiction of what Mr Essa so called Mr Gupta, Mr Eric Wood was saying, I asked that it goes to IFC, I said that we need DPE approval and I said we need PFMA approval.  So I find that actually, it is totally a contradiction of what I did.  I acted against what they were wanting to happen and there is no way I could have known that this agreement was signed.  And if this agreement was signed between these two companies, why would they bringing the submission to us and saying that the business rescue practitioner wants to save OCM.  The submission in itself is incorrect or is unethical if there was an agreement as you said now for the sale of this particular company.     Okay, when I say the Board okay I cannot speak for everybody.      My apologies, let me speak for myself.      Can I say something?     Chair I can only ask that you look at the evidence and you treat all of us fairly.  It has been a hell of a four years for me, I am not going to get emotional on TV, but we did not want an inquiry, the inquiry was put to us by the President and the Minister.  We did not ask for the suspensions, that was put to us by the Minister and Mr Tsotsi  On the issues of the suspensions I have addressed it in my supplement, you really need to listen to the 19 t h recording, the 19 t h of March recording sets the platform in terms of how Mr Tsotsi got the misdemeanours and I think that created a platform which scared the Board members that the Executives would have far bigger claims against Eskom, and I know that will be dealt with later, but it is in my supplementary affidavit. On the issue of the transactions you can see now for the very first time on the evidence that some of us pushed back and we were working in favour of Eskom, so I can only plead with you to look at the evidence for the first time, take cognisance of that fact.     You know there’s numerous people that it reports in terms of the GAP analysis that is presented to you, not a single one of those people  have contacted me, yet I tried to contact them.     No, I do respect that.     I do respect that, and that is why I tried to give the Commission as much tangible evidence.        I am not here sitting on this chair accusing people of State Capture of doing anything, unless I have attached a tangible document, so I hope you will take cognisance of that.     I am fine, but my counsel will need ...[intervenes]      Oh absolutely.     I am fine Chair.    PFMA approval.    Yes and then whether this needs to go to the DPE because it was over the R1.5 billion.    I did …    No I was not pushed – I was not pushing back on the decision.    I did support the money to go to OCM.    But I pushed back in terms of you led evidence that the particular person that was communicating with Eskom in terms of the submission did what – wanted to avoid the matter going up for discussion.  Wanted to avoid the matter going to IFC and in that respect I had brought all those scenarios back into the – into the situation and that is how this matter ended up going to IFC.    Sorry Chair but I did support the transaction.     I did believe the money should go to OCM.    Yes.  So...    Correct.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes I do.  So we had a meeting a week before in September where we had a discussion on the – in fact the journalist were writing the wrong information and giving the wrong information out and in those minutes it is clearly reflected for us to approach the journalist.  I think we even spoke about a gentleman called Mr Yelland because he was very proactive on Eskom and we wanted to liaise with him so that he would give out the right information and the whole intention was to get South Africa on board of understanding what was happening at Eskom with the load shedding and whatever.    That happened a week before …    Okay.    That meeting…    No, no.    The resolution was done via a Round Robin.    And why I remember it is because it was on my daughter’s birthday and we were in the US.    So I do not remember us signing off on it.    So I do not understand how a resolution was taken because about five of us were in the US.    No.    No because we were away – we were overseas.  I think it was something that was you know going to happen or a resolution – but we did not sign off because as I said we were overseas.    And I think Mr Koko has also said it was never implemented or something like that I heard in his evidence.    Yes.    There was no pushback on the transaction but in terms of what the implication was.    Yes there was a pushback.    You led evidence that this  particular inter-portal person did not want…    So it was pretty obvious from your evidence that whoever was liaising with Eskom did not want this matter discussed openly.    They wanted to avoid a discussion.     And that is why they insisted that the matter does not go to IFP.    Yes.     I do not remember but you put it with Ms Daniels.  The person that was…    Yes.     Was emailing and advising that this matter must never – take out the IFC submission it must not go to the DPE.    No I only found out about it when you led evidence with Ms Daniels that this had transpired and then I …    No correct yes.  But you must also remember the implication is that this board was helping in a particular company like Tegeta and we were not and there is the evidence.    Correct which meant they would have had to have a meeting or would have had to approve it.    Sematic.  Semantic.  At the end of the day I wanted IFC to approve it.    And that is what happened.    It did go to IFC.    So – no I do not know she gave her evidence.    I know Ms Daniels confirmed my email.    Absolutely not.  We found out about it – there was a media briefing – it was a couple of months after I had even left.  There was a media briefing I think it was Dr Ngubane and Mr Singh were sitting and one of the journalists asked Dr Ngubane I think it was about the guarantee and he was taken aback and then I saw from the media briefing Mr Singh explaining to him and then he explained what it was.  No so none of us knew about it.  And if you see that video you can see he was like shocked.    Yes I…    I think I definitely left.  I left on the 30t h of June.  I think this was after.  I think it was even – it could have been after the Public Protectors Report.    Because she did not deal with it in her report.    So I attached in my affidavit an annexure from Mr Pamensky which was sent in I think it was around June/July 5 where he addresses Mr Anoj Singh appointment.    Ja.    And he mentions I think rubber stamping there also because we were not made aware of Mr Singh – ja.    No not at that stage.  We – that – yes.  So that email was dated 24t h of June 2015 we were made aware on the 25t h of June.    But by then it already happened.    On the basis Chair of that submission proposed owner yes that is the thing here.    No so what happens with a Round Robin it gets ratified at a later stage.  After the 8t h of September when I sent that email I never heard back from Ms Daniels so I did not know that this matter eventually went to IFC and that this happened. As I said on that particular media briefing I found out about it.  I went back and I looked at the submission I found it and then when I went to Parliament I advised them that you know I had never been told or nobody came back to me and said even there was an IFC meeting and this is what happened.  When I was preparing for IFC – for Parliament Ms Klein told me yes there was an IFC meeting. She sent me the minutes and the one with Dr Pat and that is how I knew about it.    So it is my understanding the matter ended on the 8t h of December.    So in my email to be clear Advocate Seleka I said kindly ensure – ensure means you need to come back and validate with me that these things had happened.  I know Ms Daniels has argued in Parliament that the word ensure is not subject to.  But if you google it it comes to you have validate and come back to that person.    So as a board member I am telling her to do this. The right thing would have been for her to come back to me and the fact that she failed or did not come back I assumed that the matter had ended there.    And you must understand we get so many transactions it is not – I do not always go back and follow up and say what you know what happened here or whatever. Normally it will come back as an agenda item at my next meeting or it is reflected in the minutes and then you enquire what transpired on the matter.  I mean I showed you a screen shot of our meeting for two months there were over twenty meetings.  So it is – you know it is phenomenal how many meetings we had which is – I did not follow up.    Because…    Because we assumed that the matter – as I said to you – I said I thought the matter had ended there and then.  But the matter was never approved.  Remember it would have to then go to DPE approval and things like that.  And it becomes an operational issue.  It falls back into an operational issue.    The 1.6 had to come to the board because of …    Yes.    So what would have transpired it would have been in terms of a Round Robin it gets ratified.  Ms Daniels in her affidavit says that this was ratified on the 19 t h April.  I went and I looked at the minutes.  There is a submission on the 19t h April for a ratification.    2016 but there is no record of it in the minutes.  So this was never – no sorry there is a record of it in the minutes.  But to be honest with you I do not ever remember that.    But the ratification – according to Ms Daniels …    I do not remember it being ratified but when I go back now and I look at the minutes the minutes is saying a pre-purchase of coal from OCM is ratified on the 19t h of April 2016.  So even four months later knowing full well that the pre-purchase never happened and instead a guarantee happened company secretaries ratifying a pre-purchase and it is not ratified I think the word says noted if I am not mistaken.    No not at all.    No I did not know that.    Yes I did yes.    And further to that it is a total violation of what the board ruling was on the meeting of the 10 t h or the 9t h the IFC minutes where the – Mr Singh I have read his affidavit he says he was on that call and I think Ms Klein also confirmed it that he was on the IFC call when they said that the – they approve a pre-purchase of coal to OCM.  So these are two different legal entities I do not understand how they took the – and they were guaranteed to a third party that has no relation to this particular transaction. And further in terms of our delegation a guarantee for the board is R250 million.    Chair I am going to be very careful with my words.    I do not believe it is the board because on the basis of the evidence and what happened with OCM on the 9t h of December there was no authorisation towards Tegeta.  So with due respect I leave out peoples’ lives and I am not going to make the…    For?  For the IFC?    I have looked at the minutes of the IFC yes.    I am sure I have I just do not recall.    Has it been signed?    Was that signed by the IFC Chair or the Chairman?    Dr Naidoo’s minutes were signed.    Yes.    And the resolution would have been – have to be in drafted from those minutes.    But I do not know what transpired after that.  I have only got these minutes that he signed.    Yes but …    You might not have seen but it was quite clear.  So it seems to me that even if we might not be having this signed minutes and if they exist somewhere I suspect they reflect exactly what was written in paragraph 2.1.2 which is in the unsigned minutes and if they are quite clear the board authorised the conclusion of pre-purchase of coal agreement with the proposed owners.  So you cannot say the board authorised pre-payment to Glencore OCM because it is there.     But Chair…    Yes.    But Chair those – that resolution that is signed – that resolution in terms of what you make reference to is an unethical document because it is not what the board decided on.  So somebody at a later stage signed the resolution are not what I see agreed they were being unethical.    And Chair that is then…   Yes.    Yes.    The submission.    But it was overwritten by the IFC minutes.    It was overwritten by the IFC minutes.  Irrespective what happened on the 8t h of December.    Yes.    Chair with due respect the matter went to IFC the next day and – because the board requested that.  And they made the final decision.    Yes.    Yes.    But Chair his minute which he signed.    His minute of IFC which he signed.    No it does not talk of any proposed owner.    I have got it in my submission.    No it is not – it is clear OCM.    Right.    But the IFC meeting was absolutely black and white OCM.    But Chair I did not know OCM on the 9 t h of December was owned by Tegeta?     [No audible reply]      Sorry, which page?     Is it 18(A) or 18(B)?     Ja?     Page?     Yes, I have got it.     But it says from Optimum.     Proposed owners.     But then we are ...[intervenes]      A lawyer ...[intervenes]     No, the lawyer and he is going to argue the intention of the parties was ...[intervenes]      [laughs]     No.     So we ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Correct.     Well, according to what I was told that this contract is about to expire.  I think the covering letter says in two days or three days which maybe could have been the day of the particular BTC meeting and they could not wait for that day to negotiate or finalise this matter. And if they do not deal with this matter on that particular day, there would have been no coal for Arnot and as a result we would have to go into load shedding. So when I got the call from Ms Daniels – I think she either called us or SMS’d us and then I expressed to her my concern.  She said no it is very urgent but they will address it on the call.   And that is when she sent me the submission or she could have sent me the submission first and then she     I have listened to her evidence and I was very surprised because why would I agree to have a meeting at nine o’clock at night on a Monday?  I have got small kids.  This was already annoying me enough.   So they definitely expressed to the urgency or we would have never ever held that meeting.   Even if you look at my questions.  My questions relate to why this was being so late.   I have even sent doctor – Mr Zethembe Khoza an     Yes, because the lifeline of this board right now are the recordings of the minutes that we have.  But it seems the 23 r d of April recording, it was never recorded.  On the 11 t h of March, the recording starts at twenty past twelve instead of twelve o’clock. The recording for this particular one is not recorded yet on the call I remember asking specifically if it is recorded.  I even sent an email to say send me the minutes.  So I only find out later that there is no recording being held.     In her evidence she said that there was no urgency.     So why would was she party to a meeting at nine o’clock at night if she felt that there was no urgency?  Why was she then responding on questions that we asked?  No board member in their right mind will hold an urgent meeting at that nature and be so upset about it when you have got the BTC two days later.     Yes, we did.  We even asked why this was coming to us because it was below our threshold.  I think the figure was 659.     Our threshold is 750.  The answer given,     Yes.     So we were so caught up with all these things that they are telling us, that you have so much trust and faith in them.  Why would you for a second believe that somebody is being unethical?     Of course, I was misled.  When I heard Ms Nteta...  You know, Judge.  When the Public Protector ’s report came out, I was so confident because I believed the people that I worked with like Brian and Matjila and all of them, which will come back and defend all of that.  And some of them did.   So hearing evidence now, it gives me – it is absolutely shocking.  People are not taking responsibility for their actions.   I know that matter came before me.  I accepted to deal with the matter at nine o’clock at night because I am told it is urgent.   You can see from the questions that I sent that I was not happy.  I was irritated and annoyed.  Then I said to the chairperson why are you calling this meeting because I was not happy. So it was a reflection of what I was going through at that particular night but I believed them in terms of the urgency and the fact that when Brian came in August.  So at that stage there was no load shedding. I understood the implications of load shedding on South Africa and the economy and I was a proud board member that time to say but I stopped load shedding.  So of course the intention was to do whatever is necessary to make this company run.     It is ironic you ask me that question because Advocate Banaras(?) called me to ask me the same question.  And he kept going on and on and on.   And I could not understand what he was trying to say because one of the questions that I put – I sent about nine questions why the RFP was late, why are we dealing with these companies, can we justify to the DPE that we are doing the best deal for Eskom before this matter is in the public domain. And one of the questions was.  Is this company the company that Tegeta bought?  Is OCM the company Tegeta bought?  Are they now being run by the Business Rescue Practitioner?   And is one of the issues that if it is run by the Business Rescue Practitioner, we do this deal with them.  Is there a possibility Eskom could lose its money?  The     I have been told by my CFO.  Yes, this is what Tegeta will give us.     Yes, we got it on the 13 t h of April.  The recording is absolutely clear.  It is in my submissions.     Unencumbered assets.  I have quoted it verbatim.  And we have, you know, quoted it - I may have missed out a line or two.     But you can do the part.     The growing concern issues is not with – nothing about whether it had money or it was a revenue issue.  It was whether they would have a bank account.  And that is why I needed – and it was not a set thing.  It was a possibility that after five months that would be the scenario.  And that the expense was by the CFO on the 13 t h.     Okay I think the...  Well, the advice that I was given by the CFO that it was a four month or a six month.  It is actually in the recording, the situation.     Yes, one of the questions were    With this particular company.     Yes, with this company and the submission even says it.  You are getting better quality coal from a stockpile.  My interpretation of a stockpile is the coal is there.  It is ready to go and take it.  It is in your submission.  It is on the second page of the submission to say this is coming from the OCM stockpile.       I do not think they said reopen.  I think they said something about production or whatever.     I...  Sorry.  Are you talking about the submission ...[intervenes]      Okay.     Yes, it talks about that.  The Tegeta/OCM is going to give you the coal from the export component of OCM Mine ...[intervenes]      Your very first paragraph on the top of the second page.       Okay now read the paragraph right at the top.     The first two lines above the six hundred thousand that it is coming from OCM export stockpile.  So even on the...   Well, they told us that this is a good, better quality and the reasoning behind it is that this company could export is and therefore it now says if you want us to keep it for you, you will have to pay a prepayment.  And the whole idea was to get this and to commit to it because Arnot would not have coal and as a result we were load shedding.     Because they would have exported it because it was export quality and there was no reason for them to ...[indistinct] they could sell it to somebody else.  That is what I have been told to say you need it.  You are in a situation.  You prepay me for it.  This is now yours.  You committed to it.     Yes, Dr Nteta’s evidence is now a totally different scenario as to what was told to us on that meeting.  She is even saying now that this was not an urgent matter.   Why would I sit down at nine o’clock at night for a meeting?  For my convenience?  Absolutely not.  And then insist on an unencumbered guarantee from a company that everyone is alleging did not have money.   
NAIDOO: From a social perspective you know gatherings and …   To clarify, you know, I was not …[intervenes]   For me there were serious legal implications to that …[intervenes]   Correct, before the submission in December. 
MR SELEKA SC:    Yes.     If we don’t stop now ...[intervenes]      Then we could possibly finish before half past six. 
ADV ROUX:   I am fine. 
ADVOCATE SELEKA SC:   Oh.     Ja, but Chair my estimation is if we don’t take a break. 
ADV LE ROUX:   [No audible reply]
