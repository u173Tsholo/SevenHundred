CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Ms Gcabashe, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Yes.  Thank you.    Oh yes with regard to…    Document yes let us do it ja.    Good morning.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Thank you very much that is very good I really appreciate that.    Thank you very much.    Yes you ready to proceed?    Mr Thabethe the oath you took yesterday continues to apply until you have finished your evidence okay?    Alright.      Please Ms Gcabashe remind what page that document is?    Okay.    You are looking for those ones ja.    Yes.    No that is fine.    Okay that is fine. ADV LEAH    Yes.    Yes okay.     Maybe Ms Gcabashe you can tell me the page of the one that was not so clear that we were using yesterday if that is easier?  I can use it for – so – until we get the clearer copy where it is.    Reference Pile – File B?    D for Donald.  Okay.    And what is the page?    Okay thank you.   13?    One second.  Yes, no I found it that is the one that has got R1 000 000 000,00.    Okay thank you.    Thank you.    I am sorry I – I thought the document you are referring to was the affidavit of which I now have a clearer copy.    I went there but I did not see the heading that you are talking about that is what confused me.    Page – I am looking at 40.    Yes I have got it.  It start with the goal was…    Alright.    That is December which year?  2011?    No, no that is fine.  No, no you can look for the name.    Ms Gcabashe can – might decide that to move on to other things then during the tea break you might look at it more if her plans in terms of her questions permit that.  But – have you found it?    Oh not yet.    Oh okay.    Thank you.    Well she had asked you to tell her more about the factory.  Is that what you were referring to when you said you went to their factory?    Ja.    No, no she just wanted to be sure that she understands what you are talking about when you say factory.    Okay.    I am sorry.  What is the EXHIBIT number?    Oh, okay and page?    I was hoping by tea break.    Okay.  2-0-6 you said?    Oh, okay alright.    Hm.    Okay now.  That is not in EXHIBIT HH10.  Is it?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Is that the new one?  The clear copy?    Is that the affidavit which has a clear copy?    Oh, okay.    Okay.  I think I have got it.  2-3-8 you said - page?    Ja.  I have got it, ja.    Ja.  Okay, thank you.    Okay.    Okay.    Oh.    So …    It is your copy of the presentation they gave you?    Ja.    Okay.    I think the question is whether apart from the observations you had made when you went to visit Paras and apart from what you had been told there about their operation.  There was any further work you did before - when you arrived back before you prepared a submission for Exco.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.1    Hm.    May - maybe let me put the question differently.    Why was it necessary for you to get Exco approval for this proposal whether you got it by going to council or not but why was council - Exco approval necessary for this proposal?    Okay.    The date?    Ja.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    To remember the …    Te date.    Maybe - maybe remind him what the resolution of 13 June says.    Does that help to you remember when you might have made the presentation to Exco?    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Maybe before we go there Ms Gcabashe.  Let us - I just want to go back - no leave it here for now - to your visit to Paras.  You said yesterday that the key thing that really attracted you to Paras was their collection of milk from small farmers.  Is that correct?    Now when you were in India what did you find was special that they were doing about collection of milk from small fryer - farmers that really you needed to - to know that they were doing?  You see when say the collection of milk from farmers I do not see what is special about that but maybe that is because I am not an agriculturist. If you do research and find that a certain company collects milk from small farmers and you are in the Free State.  I would imagine that all you - you need is oh that might be a good idea.  So let us look at how we could do that here if it would be viable to do it.  I am not sure that that is something really that should be key to any - anything. Are you able to help me understand that?  I mean you have small farmers in Thembalihle or Thembalihle or wherever and you would have the dairy - the dairy farm somewhere.  If you decide that it would be viable that the farm should collect milk from farmers either you are going to send a truck or a car or whatever to go and collect - collect it or you will say to the farmers you bring the - your milk to the farms.  So I am not sure that I understand why that would really be key.    I am - I am sorry.  I have also understood you to be saying - to be talking about collecting the milk …    But I just heard now as if you are saying meat.    Milk?    Meat?    Okay milk?    Oh okay alright.  Let us …    Ja, but I still do not see why you need to go and – go to India for that, that should be key, because if you are going to establish a project which will require somebody else to supply you with a certain product obviously you must have your requirements as to what requirements must the product meet, in order for it to be acceptable to you, so you might say well the quality of the milk in the case of a dairy, milk that you are going to collect from the small farmers these are the requirements, and if they have difficulty in meeting those requirements in a private sector situation you might not have any interest in helping them, you say I will only deal  with those who meet my requirements, that is how business operates, those who cannot meet my requirements I will not have anything to do with that, but in this case because you are government and you want to assist the small farmers you might then say well what we will need to do is see how we can assist the small farmers to give this farm quality milk, that part I understand, but it seems to me that all you need really is people who know what advices should be given, who would know what needs to be done for small farmers to provide quality milk.  I am just not sure that I see this spatial key thing that I think you had in mind Paras would be  having about the collection of milk and I am trying to understand it and put myself in your position.    Well part of what you have said might be helpful in the sense that I think you say in terms of what the requirements would be for the milk to be of the relevant level of quality, that you knew, you knew what is required.    Yes, what you needed is somebody who would assist in helping the small farmers to do what is necessary in order for their milk to be at the right level of quality, is that right?    Yes, now is my understanding correct that you say you did approach various entities or organisations or companies within the country to say we would like to help as the Provincial Government, or as the department to help small farmers here in the Free State or in Vrede to do what is necessary in order for them to produce quality milk.    And you say nobody was interested?    Who are the entities that you approached?    And they were not prepared to assist in your efforts to effectively help the small farmers to produce quality milk, they were not prepared to be involved in such a project?    But did you write to them or did you speak to them or both?    And at that – and around when was that in relation to your trip to India, was it before or after, I guess it was before.    Are you able to give some estimate, it must have been 2011 I guess?    And what reasons did they give, if they gave any reasons, for not being prepared to partner with the Provincial Government to assist small farmers?    Now one of the things you said you found Paras did was to send their own vet to the small farmers in India, they would send their own vet.    It is just difficult for me to understand that you would not be able to get people to assist with this kind of thing when so many people accept that there is a need for transformation in various sectors and there is a need to contribute and so on, that is part of my difficulty but your evidence is you tried, nobody showed interest?    But did you tell them that the you know there would be money for them if they came on board, they will get money as well?    And they were not interested?    You say I have got money, I will give you money, I am not asking you to do this for free, they still are not interested?    But it is just interesting you know somebody in South Africa is in business, you say I want to do business with you, you will get money from me, I am not asking you to do this for free, they are not interested, but somebody in India is interested.  Can you see that?    In the country?    Yes.    Okay.    Okay thank you.    Yes.    Ja, I think you did make that point.    I guess if you are given access?    Oh okay, yes.    I can appreciate, okay yes.    Oh the one you were struggling to remember and mentioned Harrismith?    It might help if you are able to mention somebody who is still in the Department that would know the document that might help.    Oh he knows about it?    Okay thank you.    Okay, we will take ...[intervenes]     Yes.  Yes, that was of course when you were still in the employ of the Department.    Yes, well when you were suspended you were still in the employ of the Department isn’t it?    You didn’t cease to be an employee of the Department when you were suspended isn’t it?   You only ceased to be an employ when your contract expired.    Yes, yes okay alright but I think the bottom line is that you are prepared to do whatever you may be permitted to do to assist to obtain the information.    Yes, okay we will take the tea adjournment and we will resume at twenty five to twelve.   We adjourn.    Okay.    659 you said?    What is the issue with that Ms Gcabashe?    Uh.    Oh the – oh the emphasis was on agreement rather than on bilateral.    No, no, no my – I thought that when you were asking him why he was calling it bilateral agreement the emphasis was bilateral but that is not what it was.  It was about agreement or memorandum.    Okay.    It enables you not to be asked who in the country have you ever seen dealing with that country.    How did you come about to have dealings with that country?  You say well it is a country with which South Africa has an established arrangement.    Okay.    So is there no memorandum of understanding such as the one that is reflected on that page?    No, no, no my question is, that page – what was the page where that memorandum appears?    Ja so my question is.    My question is are you saying that there was no such memorandum this is a fake thing or something – did it not exist, was it not entered into between South Africa and India that document or is your point on the content of the memorandum?    Yes okay let us try and get this clear.  So it is accepted that there was a memorandum of understanding between the two countries, is that part correct?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes so that part is fine?    Okay.  The part which is in contention is whether it is an agreement, is that part of what is in contention?    On the document?    Irrespective of what it is called whether agreement or understanding.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No, no but that is why I said I want to find out whether another point of contention is whether it is an agreement or not.    Okay.  Alright.  And then the reliance whether reliance on it was justified?    I think you – you want to add?    Yes.    Yes.    In the memorandum?    Yes.    Okay you understand – you understand the points of    Okay.  I do not know whether you would then want to take from there now that there is clarity.    Yes.    Yes.    Well the question is are you aware of that or not?  Let us start there.  Yes you are aware or no you are not aware and then we can take it from there.  What Ms Gcabashe is saying to you is that before that memorandum of understanding could be operational – could be put into effect certain things had to be put in place.  They are set out in the memorandum and she has referred you to them.  And as long as those things had not been done the memorandum of understanding could not be of use and she is saying you are aware that those things had not been done.  Are you not aware that they had not been done as yet when this happened?    Well maybe let us talk about that protection because in part that is what Ms Gcabashe is talking about but she may – at this stage she might be talking about a certain aspect of the protection.  Let us talk about another aspect of protection.    There is a protection that I said to you, you may have been thinking of and you agreed.  Okay?  Now the point – part of the point being made is I will – or at least that is what I am thinking.  If you are going to rely on an agreement or on this memorandum of understanding at least you would be expected to check that it was operational already.  Because if it was not operational it could not give you any protection, do you agree with the latter part?    Yes.  So – so did you check whether it was operational before relying on it?    Now you heard Ms Gcabashe referring you to a certain clause I think it was 5 if I am not mistaken which sets out what needed to be done before the memorandum could be operational.  Do you not agree that those requirements that she drew your attention to were requirements that had to be met before the memorandum could be operational?  Do you not agree with that part?  Irrespective of what may have been happening factually namely maybe there were meetings taking place notwithstanding the fact that maybe those requirements had not been met.  Leave out what may have been happening factually.  If you look at that clause and requirements being set do you not agree that those requirements would have had to be met before the agreement – the memorandum could be operational?    Yes.    Just talk – talk to that, let me hear that.    Yes but just to make sure that we understand each other.  Are you saying that the clause that Ms Gcabashe read to you has reflecting requirements that had to be satisfied before the memorandum of understanding could be operational?  Are you saying you do not agree that that clause says that?  Or do you want to be referred to it?  Ms Gcabashe do you want to continue from there?    Oh okay.    Yes that is fine.    Hm.    Okay just – just so that we make progress.  From what you say it seems to me that you accept council’s proposition that the structure contemplated by the memorandum had not been established, is that correct?  You accept that?    The JW.    Had been established?    And was it in operation?    Okay it is just important that when a question is being put to you you deal with it first even if you have some elaboration so that we know where areas of difference are.  So you say the structure to which she referred had been established?    So does that mean that your understanding therefore is that that memorandum of understanding – let me rephrase that.  Is your understanding therefore that everything, every requirement had been met that needed to be met for the memorandum to be operational?    No, no, no let us get it right.  Are – is that a yes?    That they have all been met?    Okay alright.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.  Let us - let me just go back to …    6-5-9.    Hm.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Maybe let us - let us - I may have also contributed to some of the confusion.  I had understood - no I think my    Ja.  Now my understanding which may have been wrong of Ms Gcabashe’s question to you or one of the questions much earlier was that she was saying this group had not been established and therefore there could be no - the memorandum could not be operational.    So I may have misunderstood that part but you - you did say recently that …    The group who had been established …    And I think the email that Ms Gcabashe has read confirms that part.    That the group had been established.    If that is factually correct it would seem therefore that the group that was supposed to implement the memorandum was there.    Whether or not they were implementing the memorandum …    Might be another issue but that they had been established seems to be accepted as factually correct.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Well …    Well may - maybe before we look at the diligence we look - we need to look at what it is that needed to be done in order to put it in force if the establishment of the group was not enough to put it in force.  So let us cover that because maybe that is where the - the trick is.    Ja.    Well we - we will have to check with him …    Whether that is what he was talking about.    Is that - is - are - is - is - are the things mentioned in Article 5.3 the things you were talking about when you said you would rely on this memorandum for protection if something went wrong?    Just articulate again what it is that you regarded as protection that you thought was necessary for your - for arrangements - arrangements relating to Paras in relation to this memorandum.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is what you were talking about?    That you - you could then go to approach national - the National Department of Agriculture …    And say we have an agreement with a private entity in India …    But we have these problems.  See whether the Government of India can assist us or not.    Okay.    Yes, okay.    You - you are free to - to comment and defend your position if you want to do that.    So it might - you - you say it might not be strict protection or guaranteed protection but you say it provides - it provided a channel through which you could ask the Government of India to do something if Paras gave you problems?    But in terms of what it is that the Government of India could do or could not do that you do not know?    Ja …    And it could be that there was legally no protection it could provide but you say at least a request could be sent through channels?    Yes, okay.    Ja.  No I think Ms Gcabashe simply wanted you to confirm that there were people who were saying is this not a public you know a private - public/private partnership agreement and others saying it is not.  I think that is what she is talking about and you are confirming that …    That is so.    Hm.    Oh.  I was about to say we have spent quite some time …    On this document, ja.  Okay.    Ja.  Feel free to do so.    Hm.    I am sorry.  Did you say 238?    Ja.  Okay.  No, no.    No, no I think all this discussion about that memorandum has confused me.    I am - I am - I was - I was looking at the black numbers instead of the red numbers.    So yes I have got it.    Ja. ADV LEAH GCABASHE    Look at …    The red numbers hey.  Have you got it?  The red numbers page 2-3-8.    Oh, okay.    Oh.    Yes.    Were given.    Hm.    I - I do not know whether you need the particular detail Ms Gcabashe whether just the month might do.    Do you remember - was it early in - in 2012, February/March?    Or was it in the previous year?    You cannot remember.    Was it soon after you had come back - you had come back from India?    But reasonably soon or two/three months later or - after you came back?  You will not be held to that as long as it is more or less - gives us an idea.    That might be good enough.    Is that - is that good enough?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Paras?    So is your evidence therefore that when you went to India Estina had not been identified yet as a company that would be involved in this dairy project?    And at that stage when you went to India is the position that you were not contemplating as yet that Paras would need to be registered in South Africa or that they would need to work with a local company.  At that stage is it something that only came up when they visited South Africa?    Yes.    So when you were in India having discussions with the Paras officials was your contemplation simply that you were - you wanted to see how their model worked and you would then come back and seek to apply it in south - in South Africa and that their involvement in the project would be limited to the fact that you were using their model and maybe where you have problems you could consult them but that - that is where - how far they would go?    But you - you wanted to use their - your first prize was permission to use their - their model …    And them being an investor in the program?    Yes and - and you discussed these while - while you were in - in India with them …    As a possibility?    And they indicated some inclination one way or another?    Yes.    I - I think I may have asked you this question yesterday but I want to ask it again because I am trying to look at this issue from different angles including your angle okay.  Could you just tell me again what the important features were of this model of Paras that you wanted to implement in - in South Africa in terms of this project?  What were the special features?    No.  I do not understand this thing that you would require permission from them to collect meat from the - from the local farmers.  Are you able to …?    Ja, what?    Ja.    But in terms of actual certainty of content what was special about what they did to put the milk at the right quality level?  Was that something that is unusual in South Africa what needed to - what they were doing to make sure their milk was at the right quality?    Ja.  No, I understand that.  I am sorry.  I am interrupting you Mr Thabethe.    I - I understand that but in South Africa there are big companies which deal with milk and that milk must be at a standard which is acceptable nationally in the country.    You - you were not looking at exporting the milk that you would produce from this farm.  You were not looking at that.  So whatever the standard is you - you had no reason to what any standard that would be beyond the standard accepted nationally in South Africa.  That is my thinking.    Okay.  Now the companies here in South Africa must be able - must be able to put - must be able to say this is what you need to do if you want your - the quality of your milk to reach this level.  Why - why - what is special as a feature in that with regard to Paras?    Hm.      But you say you are also not able to articulate and you must just be -  you must listen to me carefully because I don’t want to put words into your mouth, you must be able to say if you say that’s not correct.  You’re not able to say what the content of the feature is that you were looking for in their model insofar as putting the quality of milk at a certain level.  You simply say there is something they do, I don’t know what it is, and I know they won’t give it to me but I like it and that’s what I want.      So in the end it appears to me, that really for all intents and purposes, your evidence amounts to saying, and I want you to be able to say whether you agree or not, amounts to say really, the only reason why we find ourselves having to work with Paras was that the local companies were not interested in helping us?      Okay, thank you.     I’m sorry Ms Gcabashe I’m interrupting you again, I think that answer also says, in effect, that really there might have not been any significance in their model because if the local companies were prepared to work with us, what they would have given us would have been adequate for our purposes as well.      Just repeat that.      Yes but I think it emphasises the point that I wanted to clarify with you that, actually the only reason why, on your evidence, the only reason why you end up where you say you end up with Paras is because local companies are not interested in working with you.      Okay.     Page 239, Ms Gcabashe?     Ja same affidavit that we have been looking at, page 239 of HH10, the one that has got paragraph 12, that we were dealing with a little earlier, page 239 the red numbers not the black numbers.     Okay I think Ms Molefe will help you – you have got it?         Okay.      No I doubt whether Ms Gcabashe intended to say anything about the quality of your English, I doubt if she…[intervention].     No, no, no Ms Gcabashe you referred to English…[intervention].     No, no hang on, you referred to English, and the – his answer suggests that he understood from what you were saying that you were saying that the English used, was relevant to whether it says what he is saying or not and he therefore said, look I studied Bantu education.       Yes.     Ja just read it.     Well I still thank that Mr Thabethe was – it was legitimate for him to mention what he mentioned, so maybe it’s how – you might not have intended what he said, but I think maybe what should happen is, put to him, what you understand this to mean and let him answer without any reference to English, maybe we’ll make progress if we do it that way.     Ja well do you still need an answer from him?     Ja I don’t remember what the question was, so do you remember what the question was Mr Thabethe, do answer if you do?      Yes okay.      Hang on one second, let me just go back, was the question when something happened?     Yes so, I think you may be wanting to explain something but the question is when and the answer might be before this and that happened or after this and that happened and then if you are then asked why, you said that then you can explain if it’s necessary, so the question is about when.      Yes okay.     I think he was not paying attention when you mentioned the page, it’s reference bundle A and page?     284, give it to me I’ll find the page, thank you.    It’s the top number, you have two numbers page numbers but it’s the top one they’re both black this time, have you found it?      Okay, alright, 284, okay.      So this is not the confirmation that you had asked for and received, this was a later agreement?      Okay.      Would it be a letter or an agreement?      It’s a letter?      Oh okay.     Yes he can’t remember, he can’t remember if it was emailed or sent or hand delivered or sent by post.     Are we back at 239?     Thank you.      Okay maybe you should tell me what you got from the system?      CIPRO document – CIPRO?      Yes.      Yes okay.      586?      Okay, yes, the main business, main object, agriculture, farming and related activities.        Yes maybe the question – maybe let’s say this, this document was it, in 2012, that you found it, you got it in the system?    No, no I understand that, but that wasn’t my question, I understand that you have been giving evidence since yesterday, so -  no, no my question is, when was it when you got this document from your system or from CIPRO, it was in 2012, isn’t it?          Ja where about in terms of month, I’m not necessarily talking about dates, just the month?     Oh just put that to him so that…[intervention].    I think maybe let us – maybe just to go straight to this.  It would appear that prior to October Estina could not have – Estina’s business or main business could not have been registered as agriculture, farming and related activities if this document is true.    You accept that?    And you have said that you did not see the document at 586 yourself it was other people who would have looked at whatever document needed to be looked at?    Is that right?    But the question that arises is whether you were told by anybody that Estina’s business was in the agricultural sector at the time the checking had to be done to find out who is Estina and what do they do?  Were you told by somebody that or were you not told somebody that or were you told something else?    You – but were you told anything about whether it was tax compliant?    Were you told or were you not told about that part?    Oh if they did not tell you anything it would mean that it is compliant.    Yes.  But did you – were you not interested in understanding what Estina’s business or main business is after you had been told that they would be involved in your Department’s project?    Why would you not be interested in that?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    So you only interest in Estina was whether they were tax compliant?    Nothing else?    And what they were involved in you were not interested really that is Estina?    And whether they were people who were doing illegal things and so on you were not interested in terms of their business?    Yes but I am interested.  You are the head of a government department.    The government department – this government department wants to engage in a very important project.    It has identified a company far away in India as the one that they want to be involved with but it is necessary that they should be a local company with which that Indian company gets involved.  And I would have thought that to say the least you would be interested in whether this company is involved in the same sector and even if it is involved in the same sector what experience they – they have and what type of company are they and how are they run, who are their directors?  Will you be dealing with a credible company?  Will you be dealing with credible people who run this company as a Provincial Government?  Will your association – will the Provincial Government’s association with this local company not embarrass the government?  I would have thought that you would be interested in those types of things that is why I am asking.    But you – what you are confirming is that even if they were not – their business was not in the agricultural sector you did not mind getting them involved in this agricultural project?    If you do not check what they do other than whether they are tax compliant whether they are a credible company, whether they – they are run by credible people you might litigate with an entity that really you do not – you should not even be involved with because of the type of business they do or the type of people who run it.  And you might litigate and find that they have got nothing.  You might have lost a lot of money and now you litigate to – against them to recover anything find that they have got nothing because you did not do your homework.    Yes but put aside what a requirement is does it not make sense that you would need to do that.  I mean if you as Mr Thabethe wanted to get into business with somebody and you were going to put a lot of your own money into a certain project would you not want to do some homework on – on a person that was going to be your partner?  Would you not want to do that?    To say what type of person is this?  Will I be tainted if I am associated with him or her?    Yes but you are not answering my question.  Would you as Mr Thabethe if you were wanting to go on a business project and you were going to put your own money and a lot of your money in it would you not want to do a proper check on anybody that would be your partner in that project before you signed a deal to – to have that person into your project?    What are you not able – well either – you can tell me that no, no as  Mr Thabethe I am – if I want to go into business and I would just go into business with anybody I would not do any check.  I would not check whether this person is credible.  I would not check if this person has spent ten years in prison for fraud and so on.  I would just go into business.  If that is what you do you must tell me that is what you do.    I would not check if this person owns any property.  I would not check anything if we lose money because of decisions that he makes or things that he does in the project and I need to recover money from him he would have nothing.  He does not own anything.  You must tell me that is how you would do – do it if that is how you would do it.    Yes but what I want here Mr Thabethe is your assessment of what needs to be done before certain decisions are taken because remember in the example that I am talking about if you were going to go into business as Mr Thabethe you would be needing to protect yourself.  You would be needing to protect your money.  You would be needing to protect maybe even your family in terms of financial security.  Here you are using tax payers’ money you are the head of a department.  You have power to use millions of tax payers’ money.  You are put in that position as head of department because you must be somebody who has a certain level of understanding of things.  A certain level of experience maybe just in life but also about what the department is about, agriculture and you have got you know degrees in agriculture.  Can you be trusted to make the right decisions and to do the right things before decisions are made in order to protect tax payers’ money that is what it is about?    So – so you 1. You did not do any such check and because you believe that it was not necessary to do the check – that kind of check. Is that right?    Ja it is important that you must – you must say if what I am saying I understand your evidence to be that you should say no, no that is not what I am saying.  Yes.    Yes but you see sometimes the law and government and regulations put requirements but sometimes particularly when you are in a senior position the people of South Africa must trust that you have the right judgment to say just complying with these requirements is not enough.  I must ask for more particularly when there is a lot of tax payers’ money that may be put into something.    So – so let us go back to necessary.  You said you did not say it was not necessary you said it was not a requirement.  As you stand here, as you sit there now do you say it was necessary to have done the kind of check that I am talking about or do you say it was not necessary?    That is fine.    So your inclination is to say it was not necessary.    But your inclination is to think it was not necessary but that is not your final answer?    Oh you would like time to think about it?    Okay.  I see we have gone beyond Ms Gcabashe.    I think let us take the lunch adjournment.  We are at twenty past one we will resume at twenty past two.  We adjourn.    Yes Ms Gcabashe are you ready?    Thank you Ms Gcabashe.  I do not know whether you want to say anything Mr Thabethe or not really.  I just do not want to cut you off in case you wanted to say something in response.    Okay.  Thank you very much.   Thank you Ms Gcabashe and thank you to Mr Thabethe and his legal representatives.  I am aware that the whole issue was handled in a very constructive manner from all sides.  I just want to acknowledge that there is a lot of cooperation coming from all sides in regard to Mr Thabethe.  His lawyers have been very cooperative throughout the proceedings.  So Mr Thabethe has been helpful as well.  Thank you.    Thank you.  We may proceed then.    He has - he has never been readier.    But before …    Before - before he - we continue he owes me an answer.    Yes.  Mr Thabethe you have had some time to reflect on the question I put before lunch.  Have you got an answer?    Yes.  No, thanks and looking back you would concede that you should therefore have done much more than just checking whether Estina was tax compliant?    Well could have done is one thing but should you have done that is - that is the more - one I am more interested in.  So in other words do you - do you concede that you should have done more than just checking whether they were tax compliant?    Yes and - and one reason why it would be important to do that because you - you referred to litigation for example earlier on you know.  If you wanted to recover some money from Estina as a result of being involved with them in the project and you found that they have got nothing.  Then the department would - will - would suffer a financial loss that may have been recoverable if it was a company that had the right financial base and so on.  You - you appreciate that?    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Okay, alright.  I was - I was thinking whether to say Ms Gcabashe maybe you should take those three one by one.  Maybe it might be easier to - to follow.  I was - I had forgotten which - which was the - I - I was - I had forgotten that which are the first and the second.  So I am wondering whether that might …    Have helped - that might have also caused Mr Thabethe some uncertainty.    Hm.    Yes, yes, yes.    Yes, okay.  Okay.    And …    And you are adding the figure - the amount that …    He was - the department would put it in.   So - so Mr Thabethe the - basically what Ms Gcabashe is saying is when you as the Head of Department were going to takes - take R300-and something million of taxpayers money and put it into a project with this entity - Estina.  She would also expect you to really check to a certain - check much more than what you did and she refers to the address of the Director and so on. So - but she - she is following upon on what you and I discussed earlier.  I take it that you - your answer would be having reflected you - you agree that when you are going to put so much of taxpayers’ money into a project you should do a better check than the one that you did.    No, no that is - that - that is a point that you - you are entitled to make, ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm, hm.    Yes, ja.  Okay.    That is the page that follows the one that has paragraph 12, hey?    Hm.    Is on that page, ja.  It is the page that has got most of paragraph 12 that we have been dealing with - page 2-3-9 the red 2-3-9.    I am sorry.  You are not referring to the contents of the agreement.  You are just - you are on page 2-3-9 but you are making reference to the agreement?    Okay.    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Hm.    But her question is who drafted the agreement that paragraph 14 refers to.    Okay.    Well I guess - I guess that must mean not that they would assist if they were going to present it to you.  They would draft it …    And then present it to you?    Ja.    Notes?    Notes you mean.  Like your own notes …    Of what should go into the agreement?    Yes.    But the question is whether you knew whether this agreement was drafted by Paras without anybody from - no - by Estina without anybody from Paras being involved in that drafting or in - in the preparation of that document or is the position that you do not know but for your purposes as long as it came from Estina you took it as coming from Paras.    Yes.  That is the correct one?    So you did not know whether anybody from Paras had been involved in the drafting of the agreement but as long as it - it came from Estina you took it that for all intents and purposes it was coming from Paras?    Okay.    Mr Thabethe might be able to say whether that was the correct month.  Do you have any recollection …    Whether it was signed in May?    Yes.    Okay, alright.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Yes.  Well that - would - would that necessarily have been the date of signature or it could be a date of the preparation of the document and - and it does not matter probably for our purposes but I am just saying there may - may well be correct if maybe if there are different dates for preparation and signature?    It really does not matter.    Yes.    Ja.  Okay.    Okay, okay.    I am sorry.  I also want to get there.  6-1-9?    A, Reference Bundle A?    Okay.    Okay.  Did - did you know whether we will still need the court record bundles …    This afternoon?    Oh.    Okay.    Okay.  Bring it to me.  I will - must the - I will find the page.    Ja.  6-1-9 on Reference Bundle B.    Well maybe before he responds maybe the in law part might confuse because he is not a lawyer, I am saying you are not a lawyer Mr Thabethe even though you did not tell me you are not one, maybe you are, but can I take it that you are not?    Yes, so he might not be able to say whether you are correct or not correct when you say in law there have never been beneficiaries, so you might wish to put it differently.    The in law part?    Ja.    Yes but what counsel is saying is as at the 5 t h of June 12 when you on behalf of the Department of Agriculture signed – well one of you I think may have signed later, but at any rate as at the time of the signing of this agreement between the Department of Agriculture and Estina beyond the beneficiary in terms of this agreement, maybe I should not say beneficiary.   The only entity or person that really stood to benefit in terms of this agreement was Estina, and not anybody that you may have contemplated would ultimately benefit, simply on the face of the agreement, but I think that – I hope I have put it accurately ,that that is the gist of the proposition.    Yes.    Yes, in the future.    Ja, for the future.    Okay.    Is that Zana Investment Pty Limited that you say would be the vehicle to benefit the beneficiaries?    Mmm.    Yes.    That is Zana?    Well Ms Gcabashe said she was happy that you were going to the second agreement and that might be because she plans to go there.    Goes with that.    Yes, let me allow you to ask and then – ja.    No you did not want to object, you wanted to put your views and we said you would get a chance.    Yes, so you have been ...[intervenes]     So you have been waiting for the opportunity.    Ja, it is your opportunity, use it.    Just one second, I am debating in my own mind with myself Ms Gcabashe, whether what I wanted to deal with I should deal with now, because once you go to the issue of the deviation that’s quite a very important part and it might take us some time, or what is your feeling?    So I will give you the chance to the deal with that, but let me ask a few questions on the first agreement first.  Am I right to think that this agreement of the 5 t h of July, I think one of you signed it on the 7 t h.    Ja, one of you signed on the 5 t h, the other one on the 7 t h, but I will refer to it as ...[intervenes]     Yes, the agreement of the 5 t h.  Is the position that you signed it without getting a lawyer to look at it and see whether it is an order if you sign it for the purpose for which you were seeking to sign it, that would be okay.    But ...[intervenes]     Of course that is a major issue, is it not?    But was there no money that the Department was going to put into this before that vehicle was put in place?    A lot of money is it not?    How much was it?    You say that is not a lot of money?    Okay, okay, alright, yes, but the issue of the interest of the government in the agreement would be a major issue because what it could mean is that Government, if the agreement were to continue as is it could mean that Government could lose millions of money because the agreement does not protect Government’s interests is it not?    Is that proposition correct?    Yes, and you accepted the advice?    Yes, but you say now you are at the point where you are interacting with the State Law Advisors after you have signed the agreement.  I am at the time when – before you signed the agreement, so my question is did it not occur to you that before I sign such an agreement that could see Government put in millions of money I should get advice from maybe much more senior lawyers than the ones you had, maybe let me ask the internal lawyer or legal person that dealt with the matter in your department are you able to indicate what kind of seniority he had or she had at the time?    A Deputy Director level?    Deputy Director General level?    So the difference was quite huge.    And the lawyer that you had internally was it somebody who was an admitted attorney, an admitted advocate, was it somebody who had practiced, who had not practiced or – do you know?    You do not know?    Do you know how long he had been or she had been a lawyer?    Yes.    The particular one, but you – but it is fair to say that person would have been quite junior?    Yes.  My concern therefore is why as head of department you would have seen it as fine to rely on the advice of such a junior person for such an important project involving millions of Rands and not go to an experienced lawyer, maybe the State Law Advisors who were quite senior?    You see that presents me with a difficulty Mr Thabethe because it says to me you may have consulted somebody who may have left varsity just a few years before, had not practiced law, and that person may not even have consulted any more experienced lawyer and you gave this person this very important agreement, they looked at it, just because they did not convey to you that they were uncomfortable you were comfortable.   I would have thought that the important thing would not be whether the lawyer is comfortable, it is whether you, the client, is comfortable that this person is the type of person who has got the knowledge, experience and expertise that would make you comfortable to base your decisions on his or her advice.   Do you understand where I am coming from?    Yes so in other words I should not say look at this agreement tell me if it is fine and if the person says I think it is fine and does not indicate any discomfort then I am very comfortable.   No, I want to know about how much does that person know in this field for me to be able to be comfortable.   If I do not know how much the person knows I have no grounds to be comfortable, but if I speak to other people whose opinion I trust in the area and they say no, no, so and so is a very good lawyer, he is experienced in these matters, he has been around for a long time, then you might have comfort, or if you know more about that person, but where it is somebody you don’t know, you just know they are in the department, you know they very junior, that you know, and this agreement relates to a very important project in the department and in the Province, but you are happy to rely on their advice.  That is my difficulty. I would have thought that your judgment would have said this is a very important project, if I am going to sign agreement I must have advice from senior and experienced lawyers, do you want to comment on that?    And you accept, don’t you, that looking back it was wrong to entrust something so important or to base your decisions to sign or not to sign this agreement on the basis of the advice of somebody so junior and somebody whose experience and expertise really in the legal field you did not know?    Yes, okay thank you.    Okay, please remind me what practice you are referring to, I may have missed something?    Oh, okay, alright.    Okay.    Okay – okay I am sorry Mr Thabethe I do not want to – you to go too far without me understanding this part.  There were funds that you would receive from different sources or maybe from one source. There were funds that you received from Treasury and were there funds that you received also from the National Department of Agriculture?    Generally speaking.    Sources.    Oh in particular funds provided to give support to farmers?    Okay ja three sources.    Ja is the ones I have mentioned Treasury, National Treasury, Provincial Treasury and National Department of Agriculture?    Only two?    Yes.    Yes.    Okay so – but those are the three sources you talk about?    Okay alright.  And you were saying that you would receive those funds and put them under transfer, is that correct?    Yes.    Ja okay, okay.    Yes.    Okay.    And in this – in this instance when you say beneficiary you not talking about a person or a farmer you are talking about the project for which it is intended or not really?    Entity ja.    Okay, okay.  Okay thank you.    I just wanted clarification I interrupted you.  You may proceed unless Ms Gcabashe wants to ask something before but I know interrupted you while you were continuing.    So you say to the service provider we are appointing you but actually you are acting on behalf of the farmer.    Yes.    Of course you appreciate what I am finding tricky.    You appoint – you appoint representatives of the farmers on their behalf.    YEs.    Okay.  You make sure they give you the mandate to…    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.    So – excuse me.  Let me go back to the two I think they are grants Ilima and CASP.    Were you saying that Supply Chain Management prescripts do not apply to those ones because you are not procuring services or goods, is that what you are saying?    Okay so – okay so for those ones those two types those goes to a transfer – I guess when you say transfer it means transfer account?    It is an item oh.    Oh okay.  So – so it is not your money?    You are supposed to transfer it to somebody?    Yes okay and you say in regard to that Supply Chain Management does not apply?    Okay.    Well hang on Ms Gcabashe I also still want to stay on these.    Maybe we call it deviation maybe we do not call it deviation that he was talking about.  Let me ask some questions before you move on.  When you said in respect of the two I think grants CASP grants and the other one.    Ilima ja.  When you said you would then – you would get a service provider who would then effectively assist the farmer but you get an agreement from the farmer that a mandate that you can appoint the service provider.  That was in regard to Ilima and CASP or did I misunderstand?    That example did it apply to that or did it apply to more than those two?    All the three?    Okay.  Now the third one being the one you get from Treasury.    Yes.  Is that the one you said is from DoRA is DoRA?    DoRA just remind me I – the DoRA.    Oh okay.    So the DoRA one this does not apply to the DoRA this example does not apply to the DoRA?    To all of them.    Equitable Share.    Yes.  Now were you saying that the Supply Chain Management prescripts and policies and procurement policies apply when you are going to use the Equitable the one from the Equitable Share but not to those that come from CASP and Ilima and DoRA is that what you are saying or have I misunderstood?    Okay so you talk about gazetting.    Is – I take it that means publish what you said in a government gazette, is that right?    YEs.    And in his budget vote the MEC would indicate what would fall under transfers?    And you say if funds fall under transfers then procurement prescripts do not apply?    That is what you saying?    Yes.      Instruction Note.    And saying actually does apply.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Now what is it that excluded the requirement for procurement procedures from application if funds that were going to be used fell under transfers where – what is it that was the basis for the view that if funds have been put under transfers then procurement processes do not apply?    Well obviously …    You - you invite bids when you have not made any decision …    About who the person is that you want to be involved in the project?    Yes.  So if you already know then going - doing bids even if the procurement processes are applicable would be just going through the motions?    Yes; but if you are going to appoint an implementing agent even in the example of a farmer.  You - you might - the funds - if you are going to transfer the funds to the farmer you might not be buying goods or services from the farmer.    But if you are going to appoint an implementing agent who is going to do certain things in order for something to be successful.  You are going to be getting services.  Is it not?    So why do you appoint the agent then …    If - if you - if there is no benefit for - for you?    Well why do you not leave it to the farmer to appoint whoever they want to appoint?  Why do you insist that you must be the ones who - who appoint?    So do you get a benefit or do you not get a benefit from the agent?    So you can do without them?    And there would be no problem?    Well is the position not that you - you want farmers to be assisted in a certain way.  You want to assist the farmers actually yourself.    Indeed under a certain regime you could have personnel in your department that you can send and say go and assist these farmers to be successful with what they are doing and you pay those people yourselves.    That is one regime in which you - you could do this but another regime is that you get somebody from outside the Government who has the skills that you believe are necessary in order to make the farmers successful.  So you - you say this person has got good skills.  So this person must be - must provide - must provide the assistance and is the position not that you pay them for their services?    And why do you not want to do that?    It maybe that we might need to - to look at this later on much more but as things stand from what you have said to me.  It does seem that you have a project which you want to be successful and you need certain services in order for it to be successful and you bring in an agent.  You call them an implementing agent.  They - they implement your project and unto the one who pays them.    You pay them?    Why - what do you pay them for?    But you - you have something that you want them to do …    And that is providing certain services …    And you transfer the money from which they get paid.    Yes.    Okay.  We might have to deal with it - at some other time.  Ms Gcabashe let me allow you to move to the area that you wanted to move to.    Oh.    Okay.    I am - I am sorry Ms Gcabashe.  We forgot to mention something.  We have arranged to proceed - continue until 5 o’ clock.  I take it you have no problem Mr Thabethe with this.    So I just wanted to mention that because ordinarily people expect that we would - we would stop at four.  So we will continue until 5 o’ clock.  Okay.    Well the question was from the time they are purchased to the time they - I think - given to the beneficiary who is the owner.  Now you - you from the perspective of lawyers they may be thinking a lot of things arising from that question but I think you are supposed to just answer it as a non-lawyer.  What would be your understanding at a factual level?  Who would claim rights to that - to them during that period?    Hm.    A or B?    D?    For Doris.    Yes, okay.    Oh she is asking you to read what is written on the      But you see, and this might just be my own question, item 6 doesn’t say identify beneficiaries, it says include identified beneficiaries in Agri BE entity, what did that mean, include them in the entity?      Make them Shareholders, make them directors, make them – what does mean take them to the company?      The remark on the right-hand column, “done”, do you mean that you were saying it had been done?      Well but here in this letter, in the left-hand column you’ve written – well above that those two columns you write Estina obligations for first phase and then you write at the top, obligation – well you write number and say obligation and then you’ve got number 1, 2 3, 4, up to 9 and under obligation you have set out what the obligation is, the first one is land acquisition, so that means Estina had the obligation to acquire land.  Then under six, the obligation under six, like all the other obligations must mean you are setting out Estina’s obligations for first phase and under six you are, in effect saying Estina had an obligation to include identified beneficiaries in Agri Bee entity and your remark on the right-hand column is, Estina had done that. So it is correct that one of Estina’s obligations for the first phase was to include identified in Agri BEE entity?      It’s not the document that you are looking for.      Yes and it’s not the form of agreement or…[intervention].     But coming back to the – your letter on page 1378 are you able to say whether you were correct in that letter to reflect that one of Estina’s obligation for phase one was to include identified beneficiaries in Agri BEE entity or are you saying you are not sure you were correct in saying that?      Okay had not been achieved?      Yes okay so it’s a matter that will be dealt with once the document has been found.      Oh the one where you need a certain document where you need a certain document to answer.      Oh so that means we can go back to number six?      Oh alright, so let’s go back to six then, is it correct then that one of Estina’s obligations for first – for the first phase was to include identified beneficiaries in Agri BEE entity?      That it was done?      Yes now including them – so you still say including identified beneficiaries means what you said a few minutes ago?      Okay that had not been done?      Because You had put it on hold?      Okay.     Well let’s – you say in your remark, Estina has already commenced investments and we know that one of the two things that you said you wanted Paras for, was direct investments.     Is that what you are talking about or investment being used for – in a different context here.     In what way?     So they were spending their money to advance the project?     That’s what you mean?     But do you know by any chance, more or less, how much they may have spent by this time around by this time, January 13 or is that something that needs checking some documents?     What they had spent?     What’s your rough sense of what they may have spent by then bearing in mind what you had seen in the reports – in the monthly reports, obviously I’m not expecting you to be exact, I’m just, you know, wanting to have a sense from – are we talking about somebody who had spent some millions already by January 2013 or it was less than R100 000, less than R500 000, are you able to give me some sense on that without having to go look at the documents or is it something that would require you to look at the documents?     Okay thank you.     Is there a page which might refresh his memory that you want him to refer him to or document?     Did you say 458?     Have you found it Mr Thabethe?      And you are certain that it had not been – it wasn’t paid, all that we are looking for is proof but -  or is the position that you are doubtful that it was paid?      Ja but your recollection is that it was not paid?      Okay but this kind of document, would this kind of document exist if the payment had not been made?      It’s done before the actual payment was made?      So it may have been done in anticipation of payment?      And then payment might not actually have followed?     Yes, but it exists.     Ja okay.     Yes okay.     That payment.     Yes, no that’s fine because we are not finishing today, I think your legal representatives with liaise with Ms Gcabashe if there is any document that the Commission is in position of that might assist in clarifying, in your own mind, what the position is.     Okay alright.     Oh okay.     She could not find that payment had been made?     And do you know whether she had gone to the bank to check or not, or she just gave that answer?     Yes your system should be able to tell you.     Ja but the department system, indicated that – did not indicate that payment had been made?     You’re hesitant to accept.     No that’s fine, between now and the next time, if it is possible from your side you will try and see what you can get but you will get the cooperation form the Commission if there are any documents that could assist you to have clarity on the matter.     Yes and maybe what could be done is to make available to his legal representatives, on Monday those documents so that by the time we resume on Tuesday he has had time to reflect on them and consider them and is able to say, yes I agree there was payment or no I still don’t agree.     Okay, no that’s fine.     Yes on Monday we are going to have a witness who’s evidence belong to the Law Enforcement stream Mr [indistinct] and he may – he might not finish on Monday and might go – continue on Tuesday but I think if he does continue on Tuesday it will only be for a short, very short limited time but there’s a chance he might finish on Monday but now I remember that I already said in chambers we’ll start at half past eight.  The only thing is, that would be fine if we finished with Mr Nkasana on Monday, if we will not have finished and maybe he’s going to take another hour or two, it might not be fair to let you be here earlier and if we have to continue with him we will start earlier, that is Mr Nkasana, we will try and start earlier unless there’s something that I can’t think of now that will prevent us from doing so.  So I think – I think we should say one, in the hope that we will finish Mr Nkasana’s evidence will be finished on Monday then we will continue on Tuesday with Mr Thabethe’s evidence and in that event we will start at half past eight.  Should we not finish Mr Nkasana’s evidence on Monday, may I request that you keep in touch with, I think Mr Pretorius will be leading Mr Nkasana’s so that maybe we can indicate, I can indicate what time I think we would start with Mr Thabethe’s evidence and then you can be in tough with his legal representatives to say what time they really would need to be here so that they don’t drive all the way to be here half past eight only to find that we start at ten or something, is that fine?     Okay, I take it, it’s fine with you as well, okay thank you.  Alright then we are going to stop at this stage Mr Thabethe and we will continue on Tuesday, we’ll work on the basis of half  past eight at this stage but Monday afternoon that might change if Mr Nkasana is going to go into Tuesday as well but your legal representatives will be Page 187 of 187 informed and then they’ll let you know.  Yes, okay we therefore adjourn for today and well resume on Monday but with a different witness, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 19 AUGUST 2019  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Good morning DCJ.    Yes we are DCJ.    I just would like my colleagues from Bloemfontein to put on record advise you as to what they have been able to do.    If that is in order.    Thank you Chairman.    Yes I am Chairman.    Mr Thabethe when we were having our hearing yesterday we were discussing Paras.  I indicated to you that I have a real interest in how Paras got involved with the Department.  In your memorandum you had indicated the memorandum to the Free State Premier you had motivated to go to India.  We discussed that in quite a bit of detail but there are one or two other aspects related to that memorandum and I would like to explore with you.  One of the first ones – in fact what I think I should do is just to very briefly summarise where I think more or less we were on the issues relating to Paras.  So we had dealt with Mr Narayan’s travel expenses being paid for by the Department, yes?    And then in the evidence you gave yesterday we also established that Mr Narayan as at the 28 February 2012 had not been appointed to the Advisory Council of the Premier?    You also explained to the Chairman on the Chairman’s question really that in conceptualising the dairy farm project for the Free State your intention was to extend dairy farming to local communities, emerging farmers in the Free State who would then not only supply milk to the dairy but also be equity beneficiaries of this project, did – is that?    Was that your evidence?  Excellent.  Part of the motivation you set out in that letter for identifying Paras as the ideal strategic partner was that – and correct me if I am wrong or if I misunderstood you, you liked their business model because they collected milk from community members and processed this milk in their own processing plant.  This is what attracted you to them?    And that is what your evidence was okay.  Now two things I want to clarify with you.    If you will just give me one – I do apologise Chairman.  Chairman I found quite a few clear copies of the same documentation in the Court Record.    So I know I am complicating your life.    But if I might ask you.    To look at the Court Records.    The – Chairman we will be back with you in a minute with that particular page reference.    That had the million millions on it.  That is the one we looking for.    So in that memorandum you – you had set out a particular motivation but I would like to take you to paragraph 40 of your …    1323 File D – Reference File D.    D – D for Donald.    Yes.    1323.    23.    Indeed so Chairman.    I would at the same time ask you while you hold onto page 1323 of Reference Bundle B to also pull out your witness bundle HH10 which has your affidavits.  Your bundle – yes. Which we call the witness bundle yes.  If you could please go to page 9 we are looking at paragraph 40 of that document.  Chairman if you want to look at the clearer copy that has been put right at the end of your file it is paragraph 40 that we will be looking at.    It has the number at the top MPT – reference MPT109 right on the top right hand side if you have the same document I have Chairman.    It is indeed that one Chairman.  So if you just go to paragraph 40 of that we are on the same…    My apologies Chairman.    40 that paragraph.  And it starts off with the goal.    Correct.    So Mr Thabethe you have noted in this 2018    Now if we go back to page 1323 which was your memorandum you noted there in paragraph 2.2 that there were three dairy farms that you had envisaged setting up.  One in Vrede, one which you – would be called the Sesotho Integrated Project and the third one would be in QwaQwa, am I correct?    So the question is, in respect of these three dairy farms had you intended having all three elements that you mention in paragraph 30 of your affidavit that is the production of milk, the establishment of a procurement centre and the production of a processing facility.  Is that what you had intended for the three dairy farms?    Can I – if the Chairman will allow me to interrupt you?  Maybe I should make my question clearer.  I am simple interpreting what is written in this letter and I do not want you to run too far ahead in terms of the developments that took place at whatever phase and point in time.  I am really here at the date on which you made the submission which was the 24 February.    As at that point in time you had three dairy projects in mind.    And the question was for all three had you intended to establish not just a procurement centre and processing facility but also you were going to make sure that they would have – have milk produced at the centre.  So you had three elements that you had pointed to in your affidavit.    Ah that helps.  But the plan when you submitted this document.    Was to have three.    Yes.  Because I want to be sure that the R17 million for the three dairy plans I want to understand that the plans would be similar or would the plans be different plans?    And you will later point us to whatever document you have supporting what you are saying about three different plans.  When we get there.    You see because we debated the R17 million the cost of R17 million yesterday which was money that had been allocated for three dairy plans.  Just again interpreting what you said to the Premier when you submitted this document.    Ja I just want to understand what the Premier understood you to be requesting from him.    Ja.  We also yesterday discussed what I called putting the cart before the horse.  So what I was expressing yesterday was that there ought really to have been a pre-feasibility study before you went off trying to put together a dairy farm and you disagreed with me and said there was no need for a pre-feasibility study before you spent R17 million on plans and more money on other things.  Did I – are you with me?  I am not misinterpreting what you said yesterday?    Correct.    Correct.    And what I had proposed to you was before you even start allocating money you really need to have gone through an exercise where you decide on whether you will have the money, whether you have chosen the right idea etcetera, etcetera and I just thought of a better term overnight.  And one could call that a pre-feasibility study.  I understand that you did do a feasibility study so I am not contesting that.      The idea I was putting to you was that of doing some kind of check on whether this really was the root you wanted to go.  A less expensive way of spending government money.  That is – so I am simply tidying up the language I used yesterday in saying my proposal was about a pre-feasibility study which I would have thought would be less costly.    We will get to them.  They are – we will get there.    Then again still staying with this particular visit you lodged this motivation with the Premier on the 24 February 12.  I am simply looking at when you signed the document.  So that is when you would have given it to the Premier.    Now at that stage that is prior to getting permission from the Premier to go on that trip to India had you been in contact with Paras?    When did you first start contacting Paras?    So you arrive in the Department in August of 11.  We know that MEC Zwane mentioned this project to Mr Roy Jankielsohn somewhere around November – October/November 2011.  In December you contact Paras.  You of course had conducted your desktop study.    And you then contact Paras.    Who suggested that you should contact Paras at that point in time?    Did you telephone them, did you email them, what did you do as you contacted them?    Where did you get the telephone numbers from?    Who in Paras were you able to contact the first time you made contact?    You did not think it prudent to use the South African High Commission to try and contact Paras or to assist you?  You are a man of protocol.  You did not try using the South African High Commission?    So when you contacted Paras what idea did you have in mind at the time?  Because it was before the 24 February so you were not looking for a strategic partner I see that in the letter of the 24 t h.  What did you have in mind when you contacted them?    So by December you had taken a decision to go and visit Paras and look at the facilities?    Do you recall who then gave you a response as you – who did you speak to telephonically and who responded to your enquiry?    No I do not want eventually I am still talking about that first call.  I really do not want to get this mixed up.  When you first called that is what we are talking about.    Who did you say you were when you called?    And what the response continue you were explaining?    Give us that name please Mr Thabethe?    I know that the one name I have come across is that of Mr Gajiender Kumar.    Would that – that is the one name I have come across.    Ja. Is that the person you contacted?    Okay.  When was the next time you talked – and you spoke to him on that day?    And he was positive in his response?    Let us continue.  Now you then had to make preparations to go to India I presume?    Okay.  You then prepared the motivation for the Premier whose response you received on the 28 February?    And again just for my own understanding in your mind what you wanted to do was go and do some form of due diligence inspection of these people who you were interested in, their company?    Because I know there are legal and commercial due diligence exercises.  Is that what you had in mind?    You then get a response on the 29 t h but you fly on the – I beg your pardon on the 28 t h and by the 29 t h you have a ticket and Mr Narayan has a ticket to fly to New Delhi.  How did you manage to arrange for that trip in such a short space of time?  Your approval you get on the 28 t h, you leave the very next day on the 29 t h.  Just help us understand who was this efficient in making sure you could leave on the 29 t h?    Hm. 
MR JACOBS:  Morning Chair.    Chair I would just like to place it on record Chair will remember yesterday there was a request or a discussion with regard to the affidavit.    The unsigned affidavit I can put on record is in line with the signed one that is in the bundle.    Do you also remember that there was a request with regards to the annexures and the readability thereof Chair.  We have gone through an effort I will not go into detail but we can – the annexures that is attached to that affidavit is visually in a better form now and can be read and we have handed over such to my learned.    Thank you Chair. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chair originally when we – we allocated a budget of R17 million was to deal with the three dairies to assist the smallholder farmers.  That was only to assist them on a smallholder dairy farmers.  Now having learnt that small dairies were not successful we – as we proceeded we then changed the idea.   We did not close them down but we changed the idea of not only supporting the smallholder farmers to establish dairies.  That was originally what the money was intended for.  But then we came with an idea of not only helping dairy but also to do processing and procurement which meant that we looked for a bigger option.  Keeping in mind that we had three areas that we needed to support.    Yes.    That is correct.    The plan was not to do the same thing in all three.    Yes.    The budget that existed was for three.    No they will be different Chair.    Okay that is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Okay.    No maybe let me repeat.  I am – my understanding was the issue of when – what we were discussing was the issue of spending the money before the feasibility study.    Then my argument was that to do the feasibility study you need the money.    That is correct yes.    Yes.    That is true Chair and that is exactly the process we followed as you can check in the document there are two feasibility studies.    Thank you Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    If I – I may not remember exactly but it was around December when I started interacting with Paras.    2011.    That is correct.    Hm.    It was my initiative Chair.    I called Chair.    Chair in their website they have the telephone numbers.    I contacted their office which was in New Delhi.  That – then I requested to talk to somebody who could assist me with regard to their business.    Chair you do use them when – when you already know what you want to do so that you provide them the information of what you want to do.  Because you need to clear the business that you interested in before you contact the High Commission.    Clearly what I wanted to do was to visit and go and see their operations.    The – my contact was to find out whether they would agree there would be possibilities of allowing us to come and have – and see their operations.    I think in the documents eventually when I called …    Yes I called the number it went into their office and then I then requested somebody that I could talk to who could assist us with the operations that they are having in terms of a dairy.    I had explained myself that I am calling from South Africa as a head of a Provincial Government Department of Agriculture so I explained myself who I was and then I then requested to talk to somebody there who could assist.    They actually gave me the name of a person who could assist.    The person that – who was the head of the office was also indicated I think it was – let me just check the correct name from my affidavit?  My apology Chair for delaying I did not anticipate.    The question.    Hey no no.    No, no Chair.    Kumar yes that is correct.    Yes that is the correct – that is correct Chair.     That was the person I was told he was the head of the office at that time.    I was able to talk to him on that day.    He was very positive.  He welcomed us to come and see.  We spoke about quite a number of things of which some of them he was highlighting that a lot of people come and visit their factories, steal ideas and all those kinds of things.  Those were the things that he was saying.  He was wary about just to permit people but he does not have any problem to people coming to see and discuss with him.    Yes Chair I – after I have spoken to him that was not the only time I had spoken to him that was the first time I had spoken to him.  After the December holiday I also spoke to him late January giving an indication that we would then confirm that we would want to come,.  We would inform him as soon as we get the necessary approval that we will be coming.    That is correct Chair.    Their company yes.    That is correct Chair.    Chair if you look at the memorandum there had been some time that I had submitted it.  Now you – knowing that you had dates that you have recommended you would not sit back and say because I did not have a response therefore I am not making the necessary arrangement.  So you do the necessary arrangement in case you receive the approval.  Because those dates we agreed with the people that we are visiting.  If not then you will then have to renegotiate new dates.  So those approval – those arrangements you make ahead so that if you get the approval the last day of your departure you are ready to be able to go.    So you - you do those arrangements ahead of time.    It - it is not the purchase Chair.  It is - it is a - what is the correct word?    It is a reservation.    Yes.  You - you talk to the travel agent.  They reserve those seats for you.    Sorry Chair.    What page?    Yes.    Yes I am there.    Yes.  I have …    I have got it.    Yes Chair.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair as - as I have indicated the - the purpose of the mission was as I have indicated to confirm that there - there is an existent the - of - of the company itself because if - if you on the web you may believe the company exists when it does not exist.  It was for me to go there and confirm.  We had a meeting with them. They took me through their company, through a presentation.  We visited the site and I confirmed the product that they were saying they were producing and a number of other issues that I was able to say yes indeed this company exists and if they are in agreement with us we can do business with them.  That - that was the intention Chair.    I - I do not remember Chair but it was in the same town.    We went there in the morning.  We started in the office where we had discussions and then after that we then went to visit their factory.    They - they have a number of - of factories spread throughout.    The - the processing plant is where they receive the milk where it is brought in by the tankers and then it goes through all the processes until whether they make cheese or they make yoghurt whatever that they want to make.  So that is the processing facility we visited.    In - it was in New Delhi.    Ja.  It - it - Chair it - it is - I will alternatively use a factory or a processing plant.    It refers to the same …    Yes.  That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    The - he had a team of people that we sat with in the office and then when we went on site it was only him and another gentleman.    They introduced themselves to us but I cannot remember now Chair but they introduced themselves to us.    Chair our understanding was that the person that we were dealing with was the head of the office.    As in the CEO and that - that is how also I had addressed him when I also sent letters to him.    No.  I - I had managed to get CEO in a number of times on a call.  If they are willing to talk to you they will talk to you.    Chairperson that - that happened later but from the beginning I had done it myself and I was - I was very fortunate that he had a certain level.  All - although his English was not very good but he was able to talk English.    The - the language issue was - was very key because when you get there to be able to clarify some of these things properly you need somebody who understands the language.  So he was of very big assistance even when we were in the meeting.  Some of the people that were making presentations they did the presentation in their local language because they were not able to speak English. So he then assisted in translating from the local language to English for my understanding.    They - they made one presentation and the other presentation was made when we were in tour just explaining to us what was happening.    That is correct Chair.    (Intervenes).    That is correct Chair.    No we did not.  We - we were in a fact finding mission.  So we - we went to expose ourselves to what they had.    Yes it was Chair.    That - that is correct Chair.    We - we started there Chair in the morning and they - they took us through the company, the presentation.  Then immediately after that we - we went on site.  My - my big interest was to understand how they operate if they are there and also to go to the site so that I have exposure to the site where they are doing the processing.    Sorry Chair.  2-3-8?    Hm.    Sorry Chair.  What - what paragraph?    Yes.    From there, yes Chair.    They gave me.    Yes Chair.    Ja.  That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  I did.    Chair - Chair on my return I then did a submission to the Executive Council so that they can officially agree that we - we interact with - with the company.  Also to present my recommendations to them in terms of initiating this relationship.    I - I do not understand the question.    No Chair.  There - there was not any further work because any further work that I would do would not have been given a blessing.    Hence the first thing to do was to request that.    Then you can proceed with any other work …    If you are given the approval.    That is correct Chair.    Chair - Chair that work was done before I went to India.  You will remember that we had already done that assessment and we had already on - based on that assessment was to go and visit and confirm.  In my return that was confirmed.  So there would not be any reason to do another assessment after you have already done the assessment and you have picked what you thought would be feasible and you have visited and you have confirmed what you had checked before.    Chair that would not have assisted me to do before I have the blessing.  That exercise was actually done after I received the approval.  Hence a submission was also made to - to Treasury to reassess the budget because I had originally been allocated a budget for three projects.  Now I have an approval to do a bigger project of which then I can make a decision to say which one do I start with. So that was actually done after the approval was granted by the Executive Council.    Chair it is - it is not only this proposal.    Yes.    Ja.  Chair - Chair let me start by saying all projects gets approval from the Executive Council.    Chair I need also to go into my document so that I can check …    The date …    Of - of the submission Chair.    Chair …    Yes Chair.  I - I remember that one but there were - there were other presentations that I did before that one.    Soon after I returned from India …    Then I made a presentation …    And then the one that is in - she is referring to …    Was the one where I - I was already indicating that this project that I am doing does not have enough money.  I request that I be assisted otherwise if I will not be able to get additional funding it may not be possible for me to do it.    Reference Bundle A.    Thank you Chair.  This is not the first presentation but it is one of the presentations I have made. ADV LEAH GCABASHE    That is correct Chair.    I - I had Chair a number of these resolutions.  This was not the only resolution that was taken.  There was a number of them if I am not mistaken.  There could be about three or four of them.  I am not certain now but there was a number of them in - in the documents of the department that Exco had resolved because this project had been discussed quite a number of times and a number of resolutions were taken.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.  Thank - thank you Chair.  The model that they have been using it is - it is not only collecting the milk but the support systems also that goes to the farmers because they would recommend to the farmers the - the quality of the milk to be at a certain level for higher butter fat content.  This is how you need to feed them.  This is how you need to manage. So they are over and above collecting the meat.  They have extended the support system to the farm.  They will have their own veterinarians going there assisting them …    Yes.    No.  My apologies sir.  It is milk.    Milk.    Milk.    It is milk Chair.    Ja.  The - the support system - what was very interesting is the support system also.  So that they do not just deliver milk.  It is quality milk that they are going to be getting from them.  So you - you - they also assist them because the - the dairy cattle (indistinct) they will then be able to assist them in - in the breeding of this cattle so that - assist them with the process of artificial insemination so that you also select the best of the best in terms of milk production. So that your herd that produces milk for you becomes top animals.  So it was not only coming to say do you have milk or you do not have milk but to set up a system that makes sure that you do very well and you are producing high quality milk because for processing purposes you do need that milk and you need your hygiene system to be - to be very high because milk in terms of hygiene if you do not keep those standards of hygiene your milk gets rejected in terms of the bacteria content.  So those are the support systems that were also, so I saw that they were very good, that interaction with the farmer, not only going there, their own words will then go to the farmers, make recommendations to them how to improve their systems on their farm so that they have good quality milk.     Ja, thank you Chair.  What the Chair is explaining is exactly what we intended to do, Chair I had indicated that we had started in the country to explore that idea, because our main idea is to support these farmers that we know they are going to meet those standards, and we have to support them, we have to develop them and make the money available for them to be able to get to that standard.   Now if we do invitation locally to say this is what we want to do and you are not getting the support, because the standard of the supply of the milk are there, in the country, this is how you have to deliver the milk for it to be consumed.   It is there and these farmers are struggling to do so, so we come in and we want to say, we want to assist them, can anybody who want to work with us join us in doing so, and you do not get that locally.  Then you begin to look somewhere else and say where else can I get help to assist our own farmers.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair we have organised meeting with a number of them, if I can mention we had discussions with Nestle, we had discussions with Parmalat, we had discussions with Clover and if I am not mistaken we had discussions with Dairy Belle.     They did not indicate interest Chair to work with us in that project.     We spoke to them Chair, we invited them, Chair will remember we have indicated that we did a lot of consultation before on these projects and to the legislature, to a lot of other people, inviting and calling them to participate and work with us.     It was before Chair.     I think – it was 2011 Chair, the process I think we did for two months consultation, I think it ended somewhere mid December, when we had started in October.     Chair what we had been doing was in kind invitation to them, to join us, because we had already realised that some of them were collecting milk in the Free State and if I am not mistaken there were specific farmers that they had signed contract with and very few of them were small farmers, and the few that I had mentioned which were in Qwa-Qwa which were also in the other place is in the Harrismith area, they had signed contracts, we had assisted those small farmers to get to a certain level on their farms of their small diaries, but those farmers were complaining that they were not making money because of the transport issue, so their main interest was to collect the milk, that is what we picked up and the development part of it became a problem, because we did not want only them to collect the milk but also to participate in developing these small farmers.     Ja, they had a technical team which included vets, there are those that will also assist them with their grazing pastures, so they had a team that will then visit them and assist them with the technical knowledge.     Ja, Chair we have tried not only in the dairy industry but also in other aspects of agriculture, we did find it very difficult, hence in developing these farmers at certain stage you can help them to produce but they may not have a market.     We did Chair.     They did not indicate any interest Chair.  Like I say Chair not only in the dairy also government has money to assist smallholder farmers, but you struggle with your money, you give them the land ...[intervenes]      That is the problem, you buy, we have been assisting farmers with farms, we have the money to assist them to develop hence the land that you give to the farmers the majority are in waste.     Ja, Chair I must also mention we had good examples of cooperation between but there were pockets of them, where you get a ...[intervenes]      In the country.     There are areas where you get a white commercial farmer with the knowledge assisting the neighbouring black farmers and we had been saying if we had issues like that we would then support financially so that those farmers develop, so you have pockets of these where you get that kind of support.     And we are willing to make money - I am no longer ...[indistinct] we were willing to make money available to those systems.     Ja Chair I did mention yesterday that some of the studies had been done before I arrived, they were already ...[intervenes]      Thank you Chair.     I can – ja I can ...[intervenes]      Chair I must just correct the other place was not Harrismith, it was Ficksburg.     Yes, now if you can request the Department to give you the study that was done between the Department and Germany on the Ficksburg proposal they will be able to give you a very comprehensive study that was done, which the Department has.     The current Acting HOD Dr Masiteng.     He knows about it Chair.     I am limiting my interaction Chair with the Department because when I was suspended I was given strong conditions not to to talk to the Department.     No, when I was suspended.     Yes.     Okay, no that is correct Chair.     I will do so Chair.    Yes Chair.    Ja Chair the – let me start with the issue of the existing bilateral agreement.  This was an indication that agreements were signed between the two departments.  It covered a whole range of issues but it also indicated that relationships between the two departments can be created relating to issues of agriculture which were covered in that agreement.    Okay.    That is correct I have it Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct document.    We referring to.    That is correct Chair. ADV LEAH GCABASHE    That is correct Chair.    Chair this might have been maybe the correcting quoting but this is the document we are referring to as attached.    Yes.    Got it Chair.    Chair if I may respond to the question?  The establishment of the dairy does not rely on this document.  This document offers protection in case if you have a relationship with a country and you get into problems you are able to interact because you have got an existing agreement.  So government can assist you to facilitate if you have challenges.  Hence we then being quoting this document.  We have not been saying this is the document that allows us to the do the process but it provides the platform for us when we have got problems.    Yes.     That is correct Chair.    Those are the points of contention?    Okay alright.    I understand Chair.    It is correct Chair.  Can I – can I – can I maybe mention something?    Our reference to this document was for protection in an event where we have a problem then we will revert to this document and request the Department of Agriculture in India to assist because they – the forms of cooperation have been indicated that document that it could be public to public or public to private and so.  So that in an event where you are no longer treated fairly then you go back to the Department and say, we need your assistance in this area and this agreement will then assist you.  Because we are already – because there were already set-ups that were formed, meetings that were happening between the two country departments where you were raising your problems, they raise their problems and you are able to resolve those problems and proceed.  Hence the document refers to establishments of those systems.    Chair maybe I am not reading it correctly.    Ja Chair I had attached these documents for everybody to see to agree not to agree.  So it was at the disposal of everybody.  Including the people that could have advised differently to say but we do not agree with you.  This document has also been attached to a number of other documents that we had been legally doing.  Hence I am saying Chair the reference to this document was for protection purposes.    Yes.  Now…    I agree Chair.    Chair the document was already operationalised because ongoing meetings were happening between the two departments.  The Department of Agriculture in South Africa and the Department of Agriculture in India.  So this memorandum of understanding was being operationalised.    Chair that is the part that I am – I was not agreeing with.      Because my …    My understanding of that was you cannot do business with a country until there is a signed bilateral agreement country to country.  That is the one which I said I do not agree with that one.  Because at – until you get to the country to country you must have examples of cooperation’s that have been successful that you can be part of your motivation for the signing.  You may not rely all – you cannot say we will only do business once country to country has been signed where there is an objection.  Unless there is an objection that we do not encourage country to country but in this instance there has been no objection because the Minister when he signs an agreement he gets dedicated to enter into that agreement.  So I did not see any problem for this to happen.    Hm.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I understand.    The structure.    Had been established Chair.    Yes Chair.    It was in operation.    That is correct Chair.    Otherwise Chair there would not have been meetings between the two countries.    No, no I am saying – I am confirming Chair that it has been met.    Because meeting has been ongoing.    Chair can I - can I …    Respond to that?    I - I do not agree Chair.  I am - I - I thought I was explaining to say putting - putting it in force would mean eventually that the - the two countries have got an agreement and the difference between putting this agreement in force.  It means the systems were activated.  That - that is my understanding. The systems were activated and the response she is reading says so.  That the systems have been activated.  They are ongoing.    Yes sir.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is …    The memorandum, yes.    That is my understanding Chair.    Ja, Chair …    No Chair.  The - the items that are being mentioned here were programs of the working groups that they will - they are going to work on but it - it does - it does not say all - all investment opportunities that exist between the two countries have to go through this working group.  It - it does not say that. So it - it says these are the key areas that - they will be dealt with and the meetings between the two working groups will be continuously dealing with - with those things and that is my understanding.    Protection will mean there - there is ongoing engagement between the two countries.  If - if you were to raise a concern you have a platform that you can get into and raise your concern.    That is the protection because the …    The - it - it is there.  It is in existence.    That - that is the protection.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Thank - thank you Chair.  Chair I do not agree that the document will not offer any protection because it offers you a platform to raise your concern because if - if the Government of that country can then engage and you are able to engage them the problem will be where you do not have a platform to engage then. Then you have a problem.  You do not know who to talk to.  Therefore I say it does not mean that this document was just signed for the sake of signing.  It - it is for assisting the country.    That is - that is correct Chair.    No, no Chair.    And …    That is correct Chair.    The - there were suspicions Chair that we have entered into an illegal public/private partnership but at that stage we had an agreement signed and it was not that.  So I do not understand where it came from because there was an agreement on the table and the agreement was not a PPP agreement.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Chair I do not agree.  The - the debate was not on the basis of this document and it did - it has never referred to this document to be have been used for that debate.  That is why I say I do not - I do not agree because later it was also confirmed that indeed it is not after all documents were - were made available. So it - it might not have been referred to this document because this document was released later not before the debate but when the inquiries were done it is only then that they saw this document.  So it might not have been used or relied on for the debate.    That is correct Chair.    I - I need to refer back Chair to …    258.    That - that is correct Chair.  You say it is paragraph - Chair?    That - that is correct.    Yes Chair.    I was - it is referring to …    Yes.  I have got it Chair.    I thought it - it was referring me to the attachment which indicates the dates.    This paragraph does not give the dates because the question was when.    Hm.    Chair in my founding affidavit those dates were - were indicated.    Can I - can I look for that one?    Because it has the dates.    Hm.    I do not remember Chair.    I cannot remember.    It was - it was after I had come back from India.    It could have been a month or two Chair.  It was not a very long period.    But I can …    Okay.    That - that is correct Chair.    Chair - Chair during the visit of the - the Indian company …    Paras.  They - they indicated interest not only on the model but also to invest into the project.  Then my concern to them was that it - it would be very difficult to interact and enter into an agreement with a foreign company.  For us to be able to do that they must register in South Africa or have a partnering company that they - we can operate with. That - that is what we indicated to them.  That we will not be able to do so because if - if you enter into an agreement with a company that its laws do not apply in South Africa we are going to struggle.  They had to register or identify a company which they can work with.    No Chair.    That - that is correct Chair.  What I can also indicate is that it was also our interest to raise their interest for investment.    Which during the visit they indicated that they can work with us but they had not confirmed if they would want to invest.  Hence we then invited them to say this is where we want to do the project.  This is how we want to do the project.  Are you interested?  Can we use your - your model because we did not want also to be accused of using a model that we do not have permission to use? On - on those basis then I invited them to come and we had discussion with them.  We took them to the site where we in turn thought we will have the project put up and then they indicated the - the interest and we - we therefore indicated to them how would - we would want them to - to work with us.  Either to register or to have a company in South Africa that they could work through.    It - it was both Chair.  In an event they would have said no we do not want to be an investor in the project.  We - we would then only get permission from them to use their model.    Their model, yes.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes.  Correct Chair.    Yes.  The - the use of the model - they were actually saying it will open up for them because in - in their presentation they have also indicated to us that they - they were exporting milk from India to - I am trying to recollecting now whether it was Nigeria or - but I think it was Nigeria where they have been putting milk. They would say then if - if you have a system similar to us they believe that this milk could then be taken from South Africa to Nigeria because …    They would have guaranteed - because in their presentation their qualifications and their certificate indicated which qualifies particular products in terms of the registration and ISO numbers.  So those were the things that we wanted them to assist us to guarantee those levels of quality.    Ja.  Chair where - where - when we did our initial research we realised that in the model they were collecting milk from the small farmers and - and that is what we intended to do versus the other models that we have been looking at.  The system of collecting the milk plus the additional support that they have been given. So that was key for us because we have - we have not seen a model similar to that being - being implemented somewhere and - and that is what we wanted to do.  When we went there we then established other advantages that were not part of our - our presentation like the support system that they have been giving to the farmers.  They would not only collect the milk but they had a system of supporting them and making sure that these enterprises were growing. So those - those were - were also good enough for us to say if - if you had to become investors would these features also come with you so that you assist that we the expected.  Some of the issues that were there were - were the certification that international certification for their milk which you could use to export the meat and sell it anywhere like they were doing so. Those were additional features which if they are not party to you - you would not use them.  They can only be used by them.    Not - not the collection Chair.    You - remember when you market milk it has ISO standards which is accredited to you.  Certain levels of - of hygiene and so on.  You need them to assist you to achieve that standard because they have been there.  They know how to deal with it.  Then they will provide support to your farmers to produce milk of that standard of certification. That is what I am trying to say.  Not to collect the milk.  You can collect the milk but it may not reach the standard …    Which they had.    Chair they will never tell you.  It is - it is - they - they - that is the information that you never get to know.  They will never tell you how they achieved because they are in - in the competition.  There are things that they do to get them to a particular level.  They will never tell you.  If - if I may use an example Chair. KFC will never give you their ingredients to get to what you - you eat as KFC because they do not want you to do it.  It is their intellectual property.  If you want it …    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  This is the debate that we have had.    We had invited them but they did not respond to us.     You are correct Chair, the general hygiene standards are set and those general hygiene standards are set by Agriculture, but in each and every company there are features that you’ll never know, that they will not disclose to you other than the general hygiene standard that you must set but those general hygiene standards that are set Nationally needs expertise for you to be able to achieve that, now if you have a group of small farmers you want them to achieve those standards, you need to provide expertise support to them for them to be able to reach those standards.     That’s correct Chair.     What I believed Chair, was that between us and them we could have worked a model.     My belief was that between us and the companies in South Africa if we would have agreed we would have agreed on a model and our model was very simple, provide support to the small farmers.     That’s correct.     My apologies Chair…[intervention].     Yes Chair, if they were to have interest then they would, either come and register as a company in South Africa, operating under the laws of this country and if not there must be a company in South Africa that they would be able to work through.     I’m trying to find the document Chair is it on HH10?     I’m struggling Chair because there’s been a divider here, it ends in 235…[intervention].     Thank you Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair. I’m not sure if I had to capture both of them, that I had said it on both side but what we have indicated here is, that when he was here we’ve indicated to him.     Chair I studied bantu education, the English that I might have written here, might not have been the best English.     Yes Chair, I had answered it by saying that we had indicated when we were in India and also when we were here.     Chair now this is an affidavit that I had signed way after, which I was narrating, what had happened, so here I was explaining what had happened not…[intervention].     Can she repeat the question Chair?     That’s correct yes.     Chair the discussion on a South African company, either being them registering or bringing another country took place when we were in India and when we were here.  What we did when we were here we emphasises after he has raised his interest, we then emphasised on it.     Chair after the CEO of Paras left, the company called Estina came to discuss with us that they have been appointed, or their relationship with Paras, they would want to take the engagement further.  I then said to them there is no problem but I need confirmation from them that they are a company that had agreed with Paras that we’re going to interact with, that’s what I did.     That’s correct Chair.     I did get an agreement that was signed between the two companies.     I’ve got it Chair.     Chair this was not the first document I got, this was a confirmation of the agreement that has been entered.     That’s correct Chair.     There should be another document Chair, where – that says, we confirm that Estina is the company that we will work with, so there should be two documents.     It’s a letter Chair.     Yes Chair.     Chair the letter was given to us by Estina.     After I’ve received the letter we then checked with Paras who will provide us with the memorandum of Estina, so they confirmed.    They had confirmed that they are – the partner company in South Africa is Estina.  So then Estina wrote to us to confirm that this is the company of preference by Paras.      I don’t remember how it was received Chair, whether it was – I can’t recall now but we did receive a letter.     Yes but there is a letter Chair that we received.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair what we checked whether the company, indeed, was registered in South Africa.     Chair we have a system in Government, we check it ourselves, we go into the register of companies and we go in there and check each company and we do confirmation by doing so.     Yes and we also checked compliance to tax because we may not interact with a company that is not registered, so the two key documents that we pulled from the system is your confirmation for company registration with company number and also the business of the company, that it does, that will be in the company registration.  Then we go into the tax system, we check the compliance of that particular company and those are the two exercises that we do.     Chair 565 is the memorandum of association.     But this is not the company you get fro the system, this is not the document you get from the system.     The company registration document it tells you the name of the company, the director, what is it registered for, it’s the – I’m just trying to get the correct name, it’s the CIPRO…[intervention].     Ja.     That’s the document I’m referring to Chair.     It indicated that the company was registered for agriculture, farming and related activities, I think there’s a copy Chair, on page 586.     Yes.     Chair I would not but the document in front of me tells me something different.     Chair for us to be able to deal with any company in Government, we had to deal – because the first thing that you do, you collect documentation because you must register them into the system in terms of Treasury, so you collect the documentation to make sure that they enter into the Government database, so you cannot deal with them unless you have registered them into your database, so you will need these documents.     It was in 2012 Chair.     I would not Chair – because I do not directly deal with it, it’s the supply chain part of the department that deals with it, so they do that and then they compile those documents, they don’t necessarily bring it to me to say, this is what we have done because it is part of the exercise that they do.    No Chair you do that after you have received the confirmation that this is the company that you are going to be working with.  Then you go and you check them into the system.  Then if there is a problem in the system then you would know because they will come back to tell you look this company is not registered.  Or this company is not tax compliant.  Then that is the due diligence that we have to do.    Thank you Chair.    Is true that is correct Chair.    I accept it Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    No I was not told Chair the business of the company but the compliance had to be checked if there was a problem with the compliance then I would have been told.    That is correct Chair.    Chair the – they would tell you if it is not compliant.    It is compliant yes Chair.    Not really Chair.    Chair my interest was in Paras because that is where the expertise is.    Estina was being used as a company that is local.    That I would then be able to deal with.   Because my interest was which I had verified was Paras.  Paras was using Estina if I may mention it as a conduit to be able to do business in South Africa.    That has been my key understanding Chair.    Yes because…    The expertise that I wanted was in Paras.    Not really Chair.    Chair it is a very difficult one to answer but…    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Ja thanks Chair.  We have not done it because we had never done it with any other company that we have been dealing with.  We have been dealing with companies we had never gone to that extent of researching requirements were that you check compliance.  So we – it did not come that we need to do that because we had never engaged in that exercise before.    Yes Chair because they were not my main focus.  I just needed them so that when – when we – if I may use an example?  If we litigate we litigate a local company if we have got problems.      Chair.    Ja my response Chair would be we had dealt with companies in South Africa but we had done that research.    I am not able to respond to the question Chair. I – because I…    Chair I have…    Chair personally in my business which I might have done it.  I have never done it.    Ja thank you Chair.  In government there are regulations on how do you go about doing that and we limit ourselves to that and that is what we did.    No, no, no Chair.     Yes I am not saying it was not necessary Chair I am saying it was not the requirement.    I hear you Chair.  My difficulty is that I could not set my own requirements I had to live within what has been given.  Hence we could not go beyond that because the difficulty in government you do less you have a problem.  You do more you have a problem.  You have to stay within the line do what is expected of you.  So you never know when you will be wrong whether doing more or doing less so it is better to stay within what you are required to do.    I am trying to think Chair.      Yes I am trying to think because I am trying to recollect on what basis would I say it was necessary or not necessary.    I am trying to – yes I am trying to think Chair on what basis would I – because if I say it was not necessary what informs my answer.  That is why I say I would need to recollect properly and check whether the answer will be yes or no.    No, no let me not respond to that Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I would only say I accept her apology.    Ja, thank - thank you Chair.  I - I would agree with you Chair that even over and above the requirement one would additionally do additional search of information.  So there is nothing stopping anybody to do so.    Yes Chair.  Given the current situation I would concede that we could have done an additional check.    I agree Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair I am - I am …    It is a statement.  I have not …    Ja.  Chair - Chair I - I have agreed on - on that.  The - the only input I would want to make is that it should not sound as if we were going to put this 300 million at a go and it disappears.    Yes Chair.  I would - I would only say if there were to be anything wrong …    It would not be that entire amount because …    You would pay money, something done …    If you are happy then you proceed.    So it could be a certain amount but not entirely the full amount.    Thank you.    Hm, the …    I have got it Chair.    Okay.    That is correct Chair.    Okay.    Ja.  Chair the - the paragraph 14 she is referring to …    Is - is not taking all the - the steps that - I think it - it is at the end of what has happened.    Yes.    It is at the end of what has happened.    Chair the - the original agreement was drafted by Estina.    Not all the time Chair.  Where you have capacity you do draft and where you do not have the capacity the other party can also draft.    They had indicated Chair that they would - they would assist in drafting the agreement and then present it to us.    They would draft, ja.    That is correct Chair.    That - that is correct Chair because we - we already both of us had documents at hand.  That document would have been then in line with whatever documents that we - we were having.    No Chair.    Document - documents mean you - you all have (intervenes).    You …    Yes.    Ja.    We - we all know what the intention is and it is the same.  Then the - the agreement can be drafted.    Chair my - in - in all our documents my understanding of interacting with Estina was interacting with Paras because it was their company identified presented to us.    Yes Chair.  Your last explanation …    Is - is the correct one yes.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That - that is correct Chair.    I am - I am trying to think Chair.  Not outside this agreement.  I would not be interested in other businesses that they would have looked for Paras outside what we were doing.    (Indistinct).    That - that is correct.    That is correct Chair.    (Intervenes).    I - I think it is correct Chair.    Yes.  The copy is very poor but I - I think it is correct.    Oh, okay.    Okay.    if - if you can repeat the page sir.    I have - I have got it Chair.    Yes.  Yes Chair.  Remember my - my original explanation that if - if you go to this kind of agreement you would not then include the international company.  You will only then put it with the local company.    That is - that is correct.    With Estina.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    We - we had already done so Chair.    Not - not yet Chair.  It - it has not yet been formally made available to us but - I - I want to use the correct word.  In - in discussion there - there was - there were no objection to us having the land.    Chair, we - we had already been having interaction with the municipality and the intended beneficiaries prior to this because by the time we were formalising we had already done a lot of meetings.  Going into Vrede Municipality organising meetings for us, talking also to the beneficiaries. So already the - the land in question was already available but the formalisation of the release of the land had not been done which we then later requested that it be formalised.    Okay.    Chair we had had the - the list of - of who will be the - the beneficiaries of the project because we had interacted with them.  We had categorised them into groups.  There were those that were interested in pigs.  There were those that were interested in vegetables and so on.  So we had had meetings before. So we had already known which of those that would have interest and we had a list of all of them even before we had formally went back to them to say now give us your names and ID numbers for the purpose of financing.     Yes.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct Chair.     Ja, Chair we had the list of the beneficiaries, my understanding of formally registering them should only come when the National Department says to us we agree in financing this endeavour with you, provide us then with your list of beneficiaries  with the following details.  It is only then that you go and collect, it does not mean that we did not know that, we knew them but in the form required we had then to go back and collect that additional information, they knew themselves also, so it was easy for us to call them and collect the required information.     No I am not Chair.     Ja Chair the processes that should have unfolded maybe to achieve what is called in law.     The in law part.     Did not happen because we were in the beginning of the project and one of the responsibilities that we had requested Estina to do was to register a company on their behalf where you will then put them in and officially then make them beneficiaries, but we did not get to that stage.  The intention was correct but we did not get there.     Chair I would not agree, because we  have just agreed now that the relationship was to stand for a year, after that the company of the beneficiaries will take over, but what I am explaining is that we did not get to the – the interventions were before we could get there, then the projects came to a stall.     I would agree Chair with your statement if it was not covered in the agreements side with Estina.     But that was covered in the agreement that they would not be the only beneficiaries, but they would be ...[intervenes]      In future yes, so it has been covered in the agreement signed by that time.     For the future yes.     Chair this is exactly what I have been explaining, because we wanted to make sure that this company becomes the beneficiaries’ company so hence I was saying we register this company so that we include it, so that Estina do not become the sole shareholder but we are saying in this agreement Zana Investment become the stipulated aggregate BEE where we are going to put the beneficiaries.     That is correct Chair.     Chair it was a shell company, we wanted it registered so that once we have completed all the processes then we will take all the beneficiaries and register them into the company, so it – like we have indicated it is a shell company, it is not yet completed.     That is correct.     That is correct Chair.     Chair let me go back again.     This agreement in front of us was the original proposed agreement that I had agreed on.  We had already interacted with the farmers so that they have an understanding that they are going to become beneficiaries, and we had registered the company and we had incorporated the company into the agreement.     That is Zana.  The second agreement Chair, I want to get to that.     I want to get to that.  When we were activating the process this agreement was then given to the State Law Advisors which were not comfortable with this agreement.  A new agreement was drafted that I then signed from the State Law Advisors.  That agreement does not look like, I was very comfortable with this first agreement because it covered all the elements that I was looking at, but if the legal people advise you this is the correct one to sign then I signed that one, but still with the intent, purpose, of achieving this, because I have been advised legally that this agreement did not protect the State, hence the second agreement.       Hence Chair I wanted to object yesterday because I saw it was coming.     Yes, yesterday I was told I should not go there yet.     Now I see it’s going there.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair because I wanted to take you through this, we have gone through a number of processes in the supply chain processes of providing support to farmers.  I will be very short in this.     Yes.     Chair in departments you have legal people but not at a level that you may require, but when I went through it, it covered the intent of what we have been looking for.   We could not see any major issue, I also asked this to the State Law Advisors if there was anything in particular that they would have raised which was a challenge.   The only issue that they raised to us was that it did not protect the State, that was the issue that they had raised to me.     It is Chair but given the position that we did not want this to run very long, because we wanted a special purpose vehicle which is Zana to eventually take over, because that will be the company where the money would go, so this was about initiating the process, get it going, getting the company registered, so that when we do finances of the farmers it goes to the correct place.     There was Chair.     It was money but not a substantial part of the money.     There was R30million that we wanted to put in so that it sets up the process going.     In comparison with the total cost of the project Chair.     That ...[intervenes]      Chair that was the advice that I was given.     I accepted the advice Chair.     The lawyer was at a Deputy Director level Chair.     Yes and the lawyer, the State Law Advisors in the office of the Premier was at the DDG level.     Deputy Director General level yes.     It was quite big Chair.     No I do not know Chair.     Yes.     Normally Chair although I will not be precise the people that will be serving in government would be those that are fresh from school.     So I would not be familiar with their process.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair even though I would not have followed the process at some stage you have an understanding that if a lawyer does not feel comfortable they consult, that’s what I know, a number of times they will tell me that we are busy consulting, sometimes they will consult senior advocates and so on and so on.  I was not sure in this case if they would have done the consultation or not, but my belief is that if they feel uncomfortable with any activity they do consultation.     I understand Chair.     Yes, thank you Chair.  I agree with you Chair, that would have been a good thing to do, in a number of instances we had referred some work, the lawyers have indicated that they would need an external lawyer to assist them.   Then I developed this understanding that the lawyer would indicate to you if I am not comfortable with this I need additional help.  A number of them where they have been comfortable we proceeded with that, so I trusted the judgment that they would then provide to me, but I agree with you I could have also used my own judgment.     I agree Chair, I already accepted it when the State Law Advisors advised me in this regard.    That is correct.      That is correct Chair.     Because this practice Chair was not only the practice in the Vrede Dairy project, this was the general practice.     The one that I want to explain Chair.     Yes, yes.     Money gets allocated to the Department to provide support to farmers, we ...[intervenes]      We – there were three kinds of allocations Chair, the Provincial equitable share, which was termed Mahoma Mobung, would be allocated to the Department for farmer support.    From the National Department of Agriculture we were receiving conditional grant.  The one called CASP which was the Conditional Agricultural Support Programme – Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme.  And there was another conditional grant which was called Ilima Letsema.   These two were part of the DoRA allocations that will then come with conditions to us.  A very strict condition that will be earmarked only for the benefit of the farmer.  We would then in the Department allocate this money under transfers.    Thank you Chair.  We – we had allocated the money before in the Department under transfers and we will then receive the money as approved by National and the Province then we transfer the money directly to the beneficiary to implement the project.  I do not want to go into details but we struggled.  We moved to the next as advised.  We allocated the money…    The – Chair…    Ja there were three…    Sources of the funds of support of farmers.    That is correct Chair.    Three sources yes.    No only two Chair.    The two will come from the National Department of Agriculture.    The two conditional grants.    And the one that comes from the Provincial Treasury comes from the Equitable Share.    Those are the three sources Chair.    Yes as we receive them they already come – they already get allocated to specific projects.    So you know when you receive the lump sum you know where it should go.    So originally then as we receive the money we will then disperse it.    And send it to the project for implementation.  It means from us – from transferred we send the  money to the account of the beneficiary.    And our responsibility will be then to assist the beneficiary.    It is both Chair.  In some instances the project will be registered in the name of a company or a CC or whatever form, a trust and so on.    Yes.  In some instances the project will be registered in the name of an individual farmer.    Yes but…    Ja thank you Chair.  We – we had problems with that because the beneficiaries were not sticking to the business plan.  Then we had discussions with Provincial Treasury.  We changed the gazetting from transfers to goods and services.  Now hence yesterday I was saying there is a difference between transfers and – we allocated the money to goods and services.  Goods and services…    Yes.  Goods and services then meant to us to say the Department is responsible for the procurement process, you cannot transfer the money.  If you want to spend the money you have to spend the money through the Department.  It means you must do the project on behalf of the farmer and hand it over to the farmer.  It means you must advertise a tender.  If say for an example you had to build a dairy for this farmer then you must go and advertise a tender, you must get bidders and then they must go and erect the – on the farmers land.  Now once you have completed you must enter that into the asset register.  It is a requirement.  Any money you have spent in government under goods and services it must go into your asset register.  Now you have a problem of having an asset in a land that does not belong to government.  You have that problem number 1.  And after you have done so you have to dispose that asset to the farmer and you cannot dispose it as a government because you have gazetted this money under goods and services it means you have to dispose these assets any – any asset that has a certain amount of value you have to dispose it through the legislature.  You go through Treasury and it goes to the legislature.  Looking at the number of projects that we were giving support to the farmers we felt that it – it gave us a problem because we had a very huge asset register of assets that did not belong to government.  Secondly we had a problem on the grant itself.  Because the grant was saying this is not meant for the benefit of government.  So you cannot take money that has been given to a farmer and you put it in the asset register of government that you cannot do that.  Then we move back to transfer given those challenges that we had.  You cannot register – it was a condition of the grant.  You cannot register that asset in government.  But if you have registered that money under goods and services you cannot escape from not registering that asset under government and then dispose it to the beneficiary.  We had a huge problem with the audit after we have done – because the reconciliation became a problem.  You go to a private farmer, you have bought a tractor for this farmer and this thing is in your asset.  You go there you arrive the farmer has sold the tractor.  Now that is in your asset but you have told the farmer this is your tractor.  He has sold the tractor and you cannot account on the tractor because it is not – you were not in control of that tractor.  So we decided we have a problem again.  We have to go back to transfers.  Because transfers actually says this money is not yours.  We are giving it to you to pass it onto the farmer. But this time we are not going to transfer the money to the farmer.  We will develop an agreement as a Department and find service providers who will assist the farmer.  Because if you give the money to the farmer the money does not get spent what we want to do.  We will get a service provider that we will then – we will implement the project on behalf of the farmer but we protect the farmer by us as government signing an agreement with the service provider.    That is correct Chair.    Now we – we sign.    I hear you Chair.  I hear you.    Yes Chair.    But they – they sign an agreement with us that they agree.    The mandate yes.    We sign the agreement with the service provider but they sign an agreement with us to say we are agree that you appoint somebody to implement the project or not now.    Then we had the control    Now that is what we did.  Now coming now to – to this process.  Now all the other projects that we had done we as government we had been advertising and saying we need implementing agents to assist our farmers.  Then they would tender and then we will then go back to the farmers and say we have the following implementing agent.  Implementing agent A we believe we can put in this district to assist the farmers of this district and so on and so on.  We will then transfer the money to the implementing agent then they do the work and they report.  We will not transfer all of it we will transfer it so that we also safeguard ourselves that if anything happens to this implement agent we have not lost all the money.  So they will and do the implementation.    The – Chair the money that is allocated under transferred does not require that process.  Once the money is under transfers you pass it on.  You do not go through a bidding process.  That is the allocation.  It is a transfer it is not – you are not supposed to go through the bidding process.  So you receive a transfer.  It comes with the condition that it is for this particular project you transfer the money to that particular project.  We – we had – why we did that it was because of the previous experience.  We then – we came up with a system that will help us to make sure that this money goes to the intended purpose.    Yes.  Also the money that we had received from the Provincial Equitable Share we gazetted it under transfers because our understanding is that it will serve exactly the same purpose.     No Chair the allocation of the budget.    Is done by the Department.    You decide how much you want to put where as you present your budget to Treasury.    As a department that is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    It is an item.    Yes Chair where you then gazette the money.    That is correct Chair.    To somebody that is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  What – hence in the past we had problems.  When the National Department comes and say we have allocated to the Province the approval of these projects we want to go and see them.  You said to us you were supposed to buy a tractor, you were supposed to put a windmill or fences whatever that was approved can we go and see.  Then when you had done a transfer you go there and you do not find those things. You cannot explain.  Then we said but the problem is that we should have put controls in place and those were the controls that we had put in place to make sure that the money that has been invested we are under control we will be able to get those assets.  And I can confirm Chair it improved.  We were able even when the Portfolio Committee comes and say how far have you gone with your [indistinct] can you show us those projects we were able to show.    That is correct Chair.    No Chair by the time the DoRA allocation from National Department comes you – we as a department on the Province we had already gone there and presented the projects and the names and the amounts.  If then there was what we called the National Assessment Panel at National.    Now the National Assessment Panel will then approve those projects. Then money will be allocated to the province as per those approved projects.  If the value……    If the value of the projects that we had submitted and got approved was equivalent to R100 million we will then receive the R100 million.  We would then have gazetted that money under transfers in the Province. So when the MEC goes and reads his budget speech he will then be able to say under farmer support we have this amount of money and this is the list of the projects that we are going to support.      That is correct Chair. ADV LEAH GCABASHE   That is correct Chair.    Chair when that budget gets released you already know to whom is it going.  So there is no competition because if the money gets allocated to us and we know from this total amount of this budget so much is for that project for so and so, this one is for so and so.  We received it and under strict conditions from National that you can only use it for the intended purpose.  Now that – that is what we have.  Now the correct thing to do is just to pass it on to the project and to the owner but we wanted to make sure that it is used for the purpose intended.  So we were putting systems in place to make sure that this money get used for the intended purpose.    The one that I have explained Chair was that we will then identify an implementing agent.  We will appoint an implementing agent then make the implementing agent implement the project on behalf of the farmer and the Department will then be satisfied to be able to report to say yes indeed this money was allocated to this particular farmer and this is what has been achieved.    That is correct.    Okay Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Ja thank you Chair.  We have to receive monthly reports from the implementing agent in terms of the progress.  We normally say – we say to them you must use our systems but we cannot take those systems into government.  We say before you buy do three quotations.  Do compares do not just go to a shop and say because they want a tractor I am therefore buying this tractor and I am delivering to the farmer.  We say to them do your due diligence.  When we do our monitoring we come in and we say you have bought this tractor the farmer where are the quotes that you have got?  Then they will be able then to provide it to us and say we have done a quotation here and here hence we have bought this tractor.    That is correct Chair.    That becomes the responsibility of the Chief Director but he has got extension officers on the ground that works directly with the project that interact on a daily basis with the implementing agent to assist the implementing agents to make sure that projects gets delivered.  So on a daily basis when they do not – they go and do quotations the extension officer is there; is able to advise both the farmer and the implementing agent.  In certain instances for an example if you are to acquire cattle for the farmer they also bring the farmer along to look at the cattle that they are buying for him if he agrees he says yes these are the cattle I want then the procurement process goes on.  So there has been checks and balances on the ground done by the extension officer and also the Chief Director has that responsibility.  Because he is responsible – there are directors in the district, extension officers and then the Chief Director overseas the whole process.      Ilima Letsema Chair.    It was with regard to…    It applied to all the three.    That is correct Chair.    The one – that is correct Chair.    It is not the DoRA one Chair.  The DoRA is the two that comes from National.    It is from the division.    It applies to all of them.    To all of them but the one that comes from the Province is the Provincial Equitable Share.    Ja it is not the one that comes from National.    No Chair.  What applies is where you have gazetted it.  It does not matter where it comes from but when you do your budget gazetting where did you allocate the money?    Yes.    That is correct Chair.  The MEC has – you submit that the MEC goes and present the budget Vote and then the legislature must pass it.    And then it goes to the gazette.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Ja that was – that was correct until April 2018.    Then National Treasury released a new instruction.    Yes Chair.    The new instruction notes was then saying this is now the way it has changed now since May 2018 but they have said it was retrospective from 2016.    And then that has now changed.    There are systems that they have been put in place now to say even if the money has been put under transfer these are the following processes that you need to follow.    Chair there - there were kinds of enterprises that you would not go and bid for.  Like when you transfer money to a farmer.  Like for example you transferring Government money to an NGO to implement a process for you.  You will gazette that money under transfer and - and you note which NGO you want to - to transfer the money. So you will not go and publish a tender to say I - I need - I need somebody to come and bid for this money for this particular purpose.  You had already - it is - it is for example like you have got - I - I want to use another example …    Outside.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That - that is our understanding sir because as - as the money came we - we had already approved projects to say this money is going to this particular farmer.    That is correct Chair.    Chair there - there is no direct benefit from Government.    Because of …    Because our previous experience of giving the money directly to the farmer we had experienced problems.  So we had to come with a - a solution.    Chair - Chair exactly the problem of accountability.  Now …    I - I - direct - the department does not get any benefit Chair.    We can do without them.    There will be problems Chair because you are not going to - to have a project that we intend …    That - that is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.  Chair - Chair you are correct that we had personnel in the department which we have used to assist the farmer.  The only difference is that if you do that then you must gazette the money under goods and services.  Then (intervenes).    Then we had the problem Chair of having to register those assets you have bought for the farmer into your asset register.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair, we - we transfer the money for them to implement the project.  It is - it is not like we are paying them.    That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes Chair.  They get paid - even if it is them or the farmer has appointed somebody else to come and implement.  That payment still happens.  Whoever you have appointed to come and do the job.    You still do the payment.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    We - we would not owe them Chair because of the conditions of the grant.  So you cannot deviate from the condition of the grant because the condition of the grant says the beneficiary of all assets that comes from this allocation is the farmer.  So you would not then take these assets and pay - the condition says if you do that then you must repay the money back because the department has benefited. It is not intended for the benefit of the State.  It is intended for the benefit of the farmer.  So you would not take those assets and register them in the asset register of the department.    Yes.    Chair hence the National Department of Agriculture makes it a condition that before they release the money you must provide them with the list of beneficiaries.  That is the requirement.  They need to know as they release the money it is intended for the following people.  Then we will - they - they have a specific requirement to say we need the names. We need their ID numbers so that as they release the money then they know to whom it belongs.    The farmer is the owner Chair.   No - no Chair. The - the implementing agent is not the owner of the asset.  His job is to implement the project on behalf of the farmer.  Hence we - we appoint the implementing - so we he is not the owner of the asset.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.  I am - I am trying to think Chair of - of services because there - there - a service could be something that you want somebody to come and - and do - soil samples and the person comes on the farm and - and does soil samples and then the person invoices you to say this is what I want you to pay me for the samples that I have done and this is what - and these are your soil samples. Then - then the - the implementing agent pays the person for - for that service.  If I were a farmer and somebody comes to my farm and - and invoices me for soil samples I will have an indication an understanding that but I have never seen soil samples this expensive.  Then I will be able to say but there is something not right here.  These soil samples are too expensive. So that - that is my understanding that I have.  That if you inflate then it will be no.  That this is too expensive.    I am - I am trying to find it Chair.    Ja.  I have got it.    I have got it Chair.    1-3-7-5.    Okay.    Okay.    Yes.  I see it Chair.    1-3-7-8 yes I see it Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Chair - Chair these remarks on the right should be remarks of the department.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes I know Chair.    Yes.  The registration was the lease agreement.    Between the - the department and Estina.   “Environmental impact assessment.”    It says   Chair my - my understanding of applied and confirmation it means the - the environmental impact assessment has - has been registered.    Applied and confirmation received, it means it - it has been - it has been done by the company that was appointed and it has been tabled to the relevant authority that needs to say yes or no.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.  Either they say no the information is incomplete.  We need one, two, three or no we decline or yes we agree.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is - that is what we when we were talking we referred to is as pre-feasibility study.    Because there was then the second one which was detailed.    Hm.    Is it - is the small one or the big one Chair because they …    Yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.    Ja.    That is correct.    That is the permission Chair that you get to - it is - it is your water rights that you receive to be able to use water.    The - the farm applies for - for it and then you then give a copy to the municipality that you have got the rights.    (Intervenes).    That is correct Chair.    Chair can I ask to repeat?    It says   “Done” it means we - we have the beneficiaries and the Agri-BEE company has been registered which is Zayna trading as Mohuma Mobung.    That is correct Chair.    Ja.  That - that is correct Chair.  Let me - let me go back.  You - you remember that it what we wanted to do but we were advised by the State Law Advisors not to do it at that time (intervenes).    Chair when - when we were advised was that the - the beneficiaries would get into the entity as we complete the project.  We should not do it before the project is complete because there is nothing to handover to them.  We are still in the process of construction. We should know them, who they are but then we will enter them into the - into the entity because you will remember that originally we - we even wanted that it should be the - the company that signs the agreement because the intention Chair was eventually also disposed the land to them through the Land Reform Program.  So that the projects becomes entirely theirs. So we - we were advised not to proceed in that process.  To register it under the Government.  The land first to become State land.  We implement the project.  Once completed, we then transfer them into the entity which is the - the farmers’ holding company.  That - that is what I understood I was advised to do.    Yes Chair because what remained would be paperwork to put the names in because what we had asked them to do.  It has been done.  What remained was our responsibility.  Remember we are writing this to them and say what we had asked you to do has been done.  What remains became our responsibility to do.    Hm. ADV LEAH GCABASHE    Ja.  Maybe Chair we would have needed the - the requirements that we said Estina should do in Phase 1 because that will be very clear because this is in response to - to what we said they should do.    Then once they have done what we have asked the to do, maybe this might not have been the details of what we had said they should do, then if we compare the then if we compare the two, then we will be able to say, but you gave them the work that they did not do, that you did.  Because my understanding was that the identification of beneficiaries becomes the responsibility of the Department together with the Municipality.     Chair that means you must then take the names of the beneficiaries into the company.     That’s correct Chair.     Hence Chair I was making the request that we need to go back to the original obligation that was given, because this might not have been correctly captured, so that if we check if it was in line with what we gave them as an obligation.     Hence Chair before I confirm on it, I would want to check the original obligation.     Chair this is not the…[intervention].     Yes there’s the document that has the milestones and the phases.     It’s in a table form.     Ja Chair there is a document that we gave them, which in response a costing of all those activities was done, that was the document I was looking for.     I don’t think I was correct Chair, because although the original intention of registering the company and identifying the beneficiaries as complete but this process of including them in the shell company had not been achieved Chair.     Had not been achieved as we were advised differently by the State Law Advisors.     Chair I think the one that I’ve been referring to ha been item number seven.     To answer that one Chair.     Yes that’s correct Chair.     It’s correct Chair that we wanted them to do that responsibility but it was ourselves that put it on hold, therefore the remark on the right is not correct.     That is was done.     That’s correct Chair.     No that’s true Chair.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Chair, that is actually the document that I’m looking for.     It’s a project plan with milestones and dates of each of the activities that should happen with a budget allocation to each item.     Chair it says Estina has already commenced investment.     Yes Chair, in the previous reports that we’ve been receiving on a monthly basis.  In the tables that we have been provided there were already indications of how much Estina has spent, they had already provided that to us, so hence they’ve already commenced.     In relation to their own Chair.     That’s correct     Chair they were already putting money into the project.     There was a phase in which they were to do the implementation but that phase, dependent on the progress that we’ve been making, as the progress was moving then they then started their part in preparation with the investment that they had to do.     That’s correct.     That’s correct Chair.     Chair we have monthly reports of the amounts they had spent and going to those reports we will be able to see how much…[intervention].     That’s correct.     Ja Chair I would need to go to the document, what I would want to mention here Chair is that we had discussed, I think, yesterday that  the Department wanted to make an advance payment which did not happen but the work on the ground continued.  The work on the ground that we were acknowledging had happened.  The Department had not spent money yet which we had intended to do.  The payment from the Department came later but what we had asked them was to say from this obligation you must differentiate from what you have done, which was supposed to have been done by us and what you have done which was supposed to have been done by you.  So that was clearly indicted in that report.     2013?     No Chair I think if you go back to the report of the investigation of Treasury they’ve raised that, that in the system the R30million was captured but never paid.     I’m getting closer Chair, that’s correct Chair.     Exactly Chair, this is not the proof of payment, this is what gets approved so that you register the payment into the system, the proof of payment I a different document.     Until I’m proven otherwise Chair.     It wasn’t paid, that’s my recollection.     Yes Chair.     It’s done before the actual payment is made.     That’s correct Chair.     Yes Chair.     Ja Chair, I may need to go back and do the re-check.     This matter, did come out during the investigation, I think, by the Hawks.  We went to the systems of the Department, we were not able to find it.     That payment and that’s why I say I will need to go back.     That’s correct Chair.     I don’t know whether you want to keep that one…[intervention].     Chair this is still a document in anticipation, that sundry payment.     Chair why I’m having a doubt is that – it’s because when this investigation was done the CFO, not the previous CFO, the new CFO was requested to go and check in the system and she came back and made a confirmation to them that she could not find such a payment.     Had been made yes.     Ja but the system of the Department – because if you paid your system must…[intervention].     Ja I’m not sure if they did go to the bank.     Yes hence I’m…[intervention].     I’m hesitating now to say, was this paid or not paid.     Thank you Chair.     Okay. 
GCABASHE: But the context is that particular memorandum. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you had purchased your tickets already by the 29 t h - by the 28 t h - let me just go a day back - when the premier gave his approval?    A reservation?    You reserved seats?    Those particular details Chairman are on page 1-3-2-5 of the document that we are looking at.  What is of interest Mr Thabethe …?    What is of interest …?    1-3-2-5.  So it is the same memorandum.  You are quite correct.    The same memorandum which was on the reference bundle.  Mr Thabethe are you there?    You found the …    Flight details.    And the - you see because it is dated 24 February but again so these are quotes that you have received …    For these flights?  What I noticed was you left on 29 February.  You arrived in New Delhi on 1 March the next day    On 1 March.  By 3 March - so one day passes.  That is probably the day you visited.    On 3 March at 11 o’ clock in the morning -  to 11 you are leaving New Delhi.    What were you able to achieve in more or less the 24 hours you had in New Delhi Mr Thabethe?    At what time did you arrive at the company’s offices on 2 March?    You went there in the morning?    Now they have a number of what you are calling factories.  Now I am assuming that you are interested in processing plants.    Please define a factory so we understand what we are talking about Mr Thabethe.    So you went to that particular processing facility that is in - you say - in New Delhi?    And was it Mr Kumar himself who took you on this tour of the facility?    Who formed part of his delegation when you met him?    You - you - if you have the names Mr Thabethe it is useful for you to mention the names of the other gentlemen or ladies who were party to what you were trying to achieve.  It just helps.  Do you know who he was with because we know that you were with Mr Narayan?    It would also be useful if one understood at what level of seniority you were - you were dealing in this place at this point in time.  That you were not talking to somebody who did not have authority to engage you on the issues you were interested in.    As in the CEO?    So you were able to get the attention of the CEO of Paras even though he did not know you.  You had not met him before obviously?    Did Mr Narayan have any contribution to make to ensuring that you were able to get hold of the CEO and get consultation or discussion going with the CEO?    What value add did Mr Narayan bring to what you have just set out for us arranging the meetings, being able to talk to Mr Kumar?    How many presentations were made to you?    Is that the presentation that you - you brought back to South Africa?    Is the document that is in that bundle I think if you look at page 2-0-6 at Annexure FR14.  There is a document there that …    It is HH10 your witness bundle.    HH10, page 2-0-6 Chair.  We will have better copies hopefully Chair by lunchtime but I only want you to confirm whether this is one of the presentations that was made to you …    Because you annexed it to your papers.    Possibly Chairman.    2-0-6.  It is really just the front page of a presentation but …    And this is why I just wanted to establish whether this is one of the presentations.  Had you taken a presentation across to Paras?    Then in relation to your fact finding mission you say they took you through the company’s books etcetera.  I presume these were written in the English language?    And you were able to sit down and go through their structure whether they are liquid etcetera?    How much time did you spend doing that?  That would normally be your due diligence exercise just to make sure these people actually are who they say they are as you - as you have indicated.    Now you also - the way you put it in your affidavit - this is the 2018 affidavit which is in HH10 at page 2-3-8.  You say that you brought back your presentation.  I just want to understand what you mean by that.  So you will find that in paragraph 10.  It is the last sentence of paragraph 10.    Yes but that of course is the copy that is not very clear.  If you want to look at a clear copy simply go to paragraph 10 of that particular document.    Chairman so your clear copy was put - I would like to think at the - right at the end of your file.  It is the only additional document that has been put into your HH10 because …    It is a clear copy of what I am reading.  I beg your pardon Chairman.    My error.    This is actually 2017 affidavit that I am looking at.    Chairman …    It is a clear copy Chairman but it has always been in your file.  So there are three affidavits.    It is was the last one - the 2017.    That is correct.    And it is paragraph 10.    My error was in calling it the 2018 …    Affidavit Chairman.    It is the 2017 one.  So that last sentence is rather ambiguous.  When I read it I thought that you had taken a presentation to India and you were now bringing back to South Africa your presentation.    The last sentence of paragraph 10.  I am simply confirming Mr Thabethe that the presentation you brought back to South Africa …    Was a presentation you received in …    India.    It is not one (intervenes).    And you have identified the document we were talking about a few minutes ago as the particular presentation?    On your return to South Africa - so again we know that you - you had discussions with Mr Kumar.  You say that you prepared a report with recommendations on the dairy project concept.  Did you do that?    And you prepared it for purposes of lodging that recommendation with the MEC?    You - you did no further work on this matter Mr Thabethe other than prepare this recommendation?  You did not sit down and - and assimilate and understand and check a few more things.  You simply prepared a recommendation on the strength of what you had heard and seen at Paras in India?    I will repeat it.    As the accounting officer had you taken a decision that Paras was the only company that you were going to do business with.  I am not talking about a blessing from anywhere else.  I am asking you as the accounting officer.    So I am interrogating why you as the accounting officer did not do further work after this preliminary visit to India to find out if you might not have other options within South Africa or outside of South Africa.    I - I would have thought Mr Thabethe that having visited the facility you would want to just by way of example decide on whether you still wanted to have three dairy projects, three that were similar, slight different ones because you had now had an exposure to a company that did things in a manner - you say - you approved of and this is why I ask the question.  Did you not apply your mind a fresh?    Why was it necessary to go the Executive Council with this proposal?    No, no.  Why was it necessary to go to the Executive Council on this proposal?    When did you make that submission to Exco - the date?    Chairman will you allow me to be of assistance by rephrasing the question …    Just to cut it shortly.    Is that the proposal you took to Exco when Exco in return then gave you the resolution of 13 June?  No.  The resolution of 13 June is - is a - in all your court papers.  I can find it.  I am just trying to help you …    To remember …    The date.    The resolution of 13 June says that you can implement the project.  It also says that more money must be found to support the project.  That is the resolution that - that came from Exco on 13 June 2012.    Chairman I have the document here if it makes sense.  Just at least to give you the page reference number.    Reference Bundle A page 3-2-3.    Reference Bundle A page 3-2-3 and I am - I am just asking you to confirm that this is not the product of your reporting back to Exco.    Would - and you cannot remember when?  I have not seen that resolution in any of your court papers.    Let us go past the resolutions and take your word for it that you did make the presentation and that the legislature resolved or rather - I beg your pardon - Exco resolved that you could go ahead.  That is what they resolved?    You then invited Mr Kumar to visit South Africa?     Chairman can I just make one small addition to the questions you have been asking.     Mr Thabethe all the things you describe you say took place between August 2011 when you arrived, August 2011 and December 2011, all these assessments of what people could do, could not do, what they were complaining about, what they were not complaining about, took place between August and December 2011?     And you will be able to assist us get some proof of what you are talking about from the Department?     Chair the Department has been very helpful, so I think if Mr Thabethe just gives us an indication of where we will find the documents he is referring to.     I am sure Dr Masiteng, who is the current Acting Head, will assist.     We are going to ask them to give all of them to us.     Thank you Chair.    Yes thank you, we may proceed.    Thank you Chairman.  Now Mr Thabethe before I actually tidy up the visit of Mr Kumar can I just get a bit of context to your relationship or the reason that you – you approached Paras.  I am looking page 237 of HH10 which I your witness bundle.  It is the 2017 affidavit that you deposed to and I am looking at paragraph 8.  So it is page 237 HH10 and paragraph 8 thereof.  Are you there?    Here you speak of your analysis of India being identified as the highest milk producer and you talk about there being an existing bilateral agreement on agriculture between South Africa and India.  Then you say see attachment MPT3.  Now I know we do not have those annexures but can you just elaborate on what you were referring to here?    Can I point you to an MOU that is part of the Court Papers in fact the copy I am holding here can be found in Court Records Chairman.  The Court Records file.    B – Court Records B and it is at page 659.  What we tried to do here Chairman was stay with the same numbering so whatever is written in in the black khoki pen will be same number that we as the commission have used.    We just tried to – instead of changing the numbers we stayed with their index to make our lives easier.    659 Chairman.  Have you got it Mr Thabethe.    Is this the agreement that you are referring to which was signed on the 4 June 2010?    Is this – is this the correct document?    Oh.    So we can safely assume that MPT3 is the document that is on page 659 of the Court Record?    Why do you call it an agreement – a bilateral agreement?    It is not an agreement Chair that is the first thing about it.    It is not an agreement it is a memorandum of understanding Chairman.    Well yes because I am assuming that the relationship that was being carved with Paras was based in part on what Mr Thabethe understood this document encouraged.    Absolutely Chairman.    Now it is important Mr Thabethe to clarify this because this document has been relied on my understanding of these papers as a document that encourages South Africa including organs of state like the Provincial Government and the Department to engage the Government of India or companies in India for various purposes.  But what it actually says is first you will find the purpose I have no difficulty is with rather it is to promote scientific and technological capacity building.  Then the competent authorities it is a government to government memorandum of understanding.    Scope of application says the competent authority shall subject to the domestic law enforce in their respective countries endeavour to facilitate the necessary support and facilities to implement joint agricultural development programmes. More importantly article 5 speaks to a joint agricultural working group.  Now article 5.1 are you there?  5.1 article 5 sub 1.  This is important.    It says   That is the precise point Chairman.  South Africa does not have an established arrangement with India not in terms of this document.  There may be another one but not in terms of this document.      Chairman the correct interpretation of this particular document is that the joint agricultural working group is the vehicle through which this particular document or this agreement rather will be operationalised.  Now    65 the memorandum itself Chairman?    Is on 659.    There are two points Chairman.  The latter but more importantly the misrepresentation in the affidavit by calling it a bilateral agreement.  A bilateral agreement and as Mr Thabethe is aware goes through various hoops before you sign a bilateral agreement between two countries.      That there was one that was signed Chairman.    In 2010.    Yes because this document.    Was signed.    In 2010.    Yes Chairman.    The reliance of the Department.    On the document.    No it is important to have the right label Chairman.    Because it has different.    It has different legal standing depending on what it is.  A memorandum of understanding.    Can never be a bilateral agreement.    Correct.    Correct Chairman.    Absolutely Chairman.    Yes.    No I was simply going to say contextually it was also important because Mr Thabethe represents the Provincial Government.    When he is interacting with a private company.    And provision for that is made in this.    Ja.    I will take him to it Chair.    I would Chairman.    I just want to point out that article 6 – so we have dealt with article 5 which is the implementation article.  Article 6 at G says cooperation shall consist of but not be limited to the    Mr Thabethe if you look at article 12 it    I am not aware that they have not been done Chair.    Chairman I – I am – the reason I raised this aspect as one of concern is because I have assumed that the Premier and the MEC would have taken comfort in the fact that they were told that there is a bilateral agreement that supports what they want to do with the private company in India.  And that is really where the concern lies.  You interacted with the MEC – with EXCO.  You – I know we will get some of that documentation in due course you have not been able to produce it and when they considered the matters you brought before them as I understand your paragraph 8 you would have said to them do not worry we actually have a bilateral agreement.  So there is this protection which you are referring to now that we would have should things go terribly wrong.  So you are misleading them in the information that you are giving them essentially and yet they are the people whose decisions, whose views you have relied on.    In his affidavit?    Chairman can I – can I again just elaborate a little bit.    On the points that you are raising.    You see Mr Thabethe.    What underscores my concern with the manner in which you have used this document is the fact that in 2010 when this agreement was entered into you in fact worked at the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and Forestry, did you not?    So you knew about this document because you worked in that environment?    You then moved to the Free State to principles who know that you have come from a particular national environment. They accept you into the Department of Agriculture / the Department of Rural Development on the understanding that when you bring information to them such as a memorandum of understanding that was signed in relation to agriculture they can trust the representations that you are making to them.  You understand what I am saying?    This is precisely the point I make.  Because you knew that a joint working committee first had to work through all the legalities, the constitutional issues you knew that this document would only come into force at a later stage yet you relied on it in 2012 and continued to rely on it now in 2019. MR MBANA PETER    Chairman because it is our job to make enquiries as a commission.    We actually made enquiries in government and I have an email from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.    That reads as follows   My understanding of this Chairman is that it never came to force and if a simple enquiry by the commission can elicit a response from the Directorate responsible for that part of the world I do not see why a former colleague who worked in that department could not just have made enquiry before relying on a document and alloweing his principles to believe that they could rely on a particular document.  I – that is where my difficulty lies.    Chairman.    Page 6-5-9 Chairman.    Yes.  I would like to add Chairman and to you Mr Thabethe …    That that paragraph 8 I refer to in your affidavit of 2017 precedes the visit to India paragraph.  So I am assuming - it is the only inference one can really draw that when you went to visit Paras you gave them the same impression with respect to the relations between India and the Republic of South African and that is of real concern because they took your word for it as did our provincial representatives/Government representatives largely because of your history in that national department.    Chairman I am happy to …    To just get an affidavit from this particular directorate …    But I can also confirm that when you look at the DIRCO website - my colleague has just shown me - you have agreements that have been signed.  There are Memorandum of Understanding there as well.  This particular one is reflected on the site with the ones that have been brought into force a note is there against that particular agreement. With this particular agreement there is no note that says it has come into force.    So I really am simply questioning the diligence of this very senior public official.    Chairman …    So if you then look at Article 5.2 it reads    This does not give him …    Chairman I believe it can be cleared up by an affidavit.    Might I just point out though that Article 8 of the same Memorandum of Understanding deals with the details of joint implementation programs.  So that is a completely separate section.  The details of the joint implementation program but be that as it may Chairman the - the concern really is what Mr Thabethe - the concern is what you did given that you the Head of a Department and accounting officer in relation to your reliance on this document to give comfort to your principals and to give comfort to a third party that some protection would be a forward. Some - some - afforded because there was a vehicle for resolving any difficulties that might arise.  This document does not give you that protection.    Can I just say Mr Thabethe that one of the reasons this agreement - I beg your pardon - this Memorandum of Understanding and its interpretation is important to the matters of the Vrede Dairy Project is because there was a debate on whether you had established a private/public partnership in engaging Paras and Estina or whether some other form of agreement had been entered into. Now the memorandum - there was that debate.  Maybe I should stop there first.  There was a debate.  Was there not?    And this particular Memorandum of Understanding could either have afforded a vehicle or protection - the protection you speak of had it been in operation or - and people should have understood its status or it would not have and that is - that is really the bottom - the bottom line.  The manner in which you have used this document.  That is - that is really the only contentious point.    I - I am moving onto a new …    Yes.    Thank you Chairman.  Mr Gajinder Kumar - you then invited him to come to South Africa?    When did he arrive in South Africa?    Page 288 of HH10 might be of assistance to you.  Your paragraph 12.    I hope I am getting - oh, no.  The …    Two - 238 not 288, 238.  That is the 2017 affidavit.    1-2 - 12.  You then invited the Chief Executive Officer of Paras.    2-3-8 Chairman and it will just be paragraph 12 of the - the clean document.  I beg your pardon Chairman.    It is page 238 period.    It is just page 238 Chairman.    Hm.    And then paragraph 12 thereof.    I thought you might be able to remember once you looked at the manner in which you had noted it in your affidavit.  In any event would it have been early in the year, would it have been …    Later in the year, would it have been towards the end of t2012?    The month is in order Chairman.    Would it have …?    That is good enough Chairman.    It is an introduction to a totally different topic.    Line of questions.    It - so it would have been before you signed the agreement of 5 June?    Right.  Who suggested that Estina partner Paras?      Now Mr Thabethe, Mr Kumar arrives in the country and you talk to him about a local partner, had you not mentioned the local partner aspect to him…[intervention].      Thank you Chair.  I was talking about Mr Kumar and the question was whether you raised the issue of a local partner with him when you were in India?      Did you raise the matter of a local partner with Mr Kumar when you were in India?      In your paragraph 12, at page 238 to 239, you talk about touring with Mr Kumar, you call him the CEO here, the next sentence is talking about the interest he had developed, the following sentence says, “It is when that, the Paras dairy CEO was informed that his interest of investment in South Africa should be through a South African registered company”, So it’s either you informed him when you were busy touring the vicinity of Vrede or you had mentioned this to him when you were in India, it can’t be both or if it is, maybe just explain it to the Chairman?      Your affidavit, the one I’m reading from?      Yes sir.      So Mr Thabethe, if you read the first three lines of paragraph 12 you will find that you say that you informed the CEO of Paras that any investment should be through a South African company when you were touring the Vrede area.      I asked you earlier on if you had mentioned the same issue to Mr Kumar when you were in India, and you said yes.      Much as this isn’t written in the most elegant English, with all due respect, what’s written here?      It’s the construction, the formulated here chair, and all I’m saying is, when one reads this, Mr Thabethe, it’s got nothing to do with Bantu education, when one reads this, you are left with the impression that it is when the Paras Dairy CEO was informed, it is only then when he was here on tour…[intervention].      Can I read it to you Chairman?      Chairman can I read the sentence into the record, as it is written here?      This is the relevant sentence, it is preceded by context.      Mr Thabethe, this is what’s written here, “It is when that, the Paras Dairy CEO was informed that his interest of investment in South Africa should be through a South African registered company”,  What should really, on my interpretation be reflected here or recorded here is,  “It is then, not when – it is then that the Paras CEO”, So it’s that confusion that arises from the use of the “it is when” as opposed to “it is then” because my interpretation is, “it is then”, and this is why I say it was not drafted particularly elegantly, are you with me?      I believe I’ve now done that Chairman.      I still need an answer from him.      You go on to say, Mr Thabethe, in the next sentence, “In the discussion a proposal of signing an agreement with the South African company was put forward to Paras, Paras Dairy had to develop a project proposal which was presented through the South African owned company”, So my question is, that second leg of the discussion, did it take place in India and in South Africa?      This further discussion, yes Chairman.      The paragraph – the sentence that I read, refers to discussions that took place at the time that you were either touring the Vrede area or around that time, are you agreed with that?      Right, then the question was, these further discussions on the South African company did they take place, both in India and in South Africa?      You go on to say – I’m just trying to make progress, really Mr Thabethe, further down in the same paragraph that the Paras CEO left the country and at some time appeared Estina company, please tell us about that?      Yes and then you asked for written confirmation?      Did you get that written confirmation?      Again can I refer you to another memorandum of understanding?  This one you will find in the reference bundle A, I beg your pardon 284…[intervention].      Page 284 Chairman.      Is this the agreement – what you call an agreement – this memorandum of understanding?      Is this the document you’re referring to?      So MPT11 is a completely different document?      Who gave you that letter Mr Thabethe?     Did you ask Paras for that confirmation?      So they confirmed that, what they had asked Estina to give you a letter?      So that letter from Estina was emailed to you?      I’m trying to get documents from the Department because you do not have the access that we have and this is why we ask, because I want to contact the department for these documents…[intervention].      You, in paragraph 13, talk about a verification exercise that was done…[intervention].      We’re back at 239 Chairman, paragraph 13.      Page 239, paragraph 13.      Did you do a due diligence on exactly what Estina (Pty) was?      Can I ask you to stop, don’t forget the next point, how did you go about doing that, what document did you ask for in checking that?      Continue, so the first thing you did was, you did a check through your system?      So you were able to establish that the business of Estina was the business of carrying on commercial, industrial business, services, sales and support, this you will find, Chairman, in Estina’s memorandum of association which is in the Court records at page 565 and 566 – Court record, so it’s the Court record file B, for Bernard, Court record file B, 566 has the main business of the company.  Don’t go – you’re going too far Mr Thabethe, I’m peeping from this side.  So the first document you have there is the certificate of incorporation, am I right, what you have there?      Yes correct, then we are talking about the same document, continue to…[intervention].      That document told you what about the business of the company?      You are aware that when this company was registered, it was registered as a commercial company, what I’d read out earlier and  that it then changed, not only the directors but it’s main business in or about – and I’m doing this from memory, October 12, I can simply confirm it but from memory, having read these papers, October 2012 but before October 2012 it was a commercial company doing business, doing – it had nothing to do with agriculture, would you dispute that?      Chair can I be of assistance, in term of the MOU that he says followed on after he received the letter and presumably after he did the verification exercise.      So you would have checked on or tried to verify who Estina was, after you received the letter from Estina saying that Paras is partner, after you had seen that the MOU between Estina and Paras had been signed, the one that you said was not the first MOU, yes or no?    I simply want to point you Chairman and Mr Thabethe you too to page 563 of the Court Record.  563 of the same Court Record.      Which is a notice of meeting and it reads    Chair we had never gone into the exercise before.  That is why it is very difficult for me to respond.  Because we had not done it before and it has never been a requirement.    Yes Chairman.    Yes I am Chairman.  Chairman before we - we resume I would like to indicate that when we broke at lunch time Mr Thabethe’s attorneys - legal representatives approached me to say that they had objected or they were objecting to my use of the sentence that the reports - that the statement - that the affidavit was not written in the most elegant English. They too felt that it was unnecessary.  They explained that in fact their client had himself drafted that document.  They had not drafted it - a lawyer had not drafted it.  I accepted the explanation on who had drafted it Chairman.  I also asked Mr Thabethe to come a little closer because I wanted to understand how he had received what I had said. He indicated he had been hurt by the comment.  Hence his reaction - his own reaction.  I then unreservedly apologised to Mr Thabethe because that was not the intention.  It never is to make anybody uncomfortable about the manner in which they express themselves.  I also asked him to please convey my apologies to his family because I live in a community of people Chairman and I assume he too lives in the community of family. I then also made the offer that when we start I would publicly so that where his family is as well I would and whoever else heard the comment and interpreted it in the manner in which he did should know that it was not personal or intended to hurt and again Mr Thabethe my apologies.  I hear your sons are here as well. Apologies because (African language) he is - he is an (African language) and really I am - I am not going to be soft as I indicated to you but the intention is not to use intemperate language or to affront your dignity in anyway and please if I do - if I do please object Mr Thabethe.  I can only learn from it when I am corrected.  It can only build my character.  It cannot destroy me but I do apologise.  Thank you Chairman.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.    Back to asking you some robust questions Mr Thabethe.  I know you are ready for them.    No.  He knows.  No, no I did say to him and we agreed.    Back to business as usual.    Oh, yes he does Chair.    Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe can I just add my views on exactly the same topic and also it is something for you to - to reflect on and I hope give us a response.  You see four issues arise for me in relation to the due diligence on Estina.  The first issue is interrogating the nature of the business that they conducted. If you want to have reference to the documentation you - you find the due reference on page 5-3-5 of the court record.  I do not think it is necessary.  We dealt with it earlier.  Unless you really want to look at that document and again at 5-4-1.  The second issue that arises is the address of the Sole Director - Mr Kamal Vasram.  It is a Sunninghill address. So when you received the - the letter confirming they were the partners to Paras.  What I would have thought would be you find the CIPC details or the Certificate of Incorporation and find that in fact the address of this Director appears to be one that is - could possibly be one he is running from home.  I am not saying it is in fact one where he lives but the address is not the same as the address that appears on the documents in October 2012. The third issue Mr Thabethe is the - of course the change in Director.  Mr Kamal Vasram changed and Su Jong took over as a Director.  These issues are important because you have set up an Agri-BEE or you are intending to set up an Agri-BEE entity that would benefit emerging farmers. So if Estina is as a company not completely above board number one, if you are putting something close to 500 million - well let us call it 300.  Let me take the Paras bit off.  300 million into a project.  You want to be sure about who you are trading with, who you are dealing with.  Am I making sense to you and this is only in terms of why I would have expected you to interrogate the issues.  That is the only reason I give you the history.    Have …    My apologies.    It is because I am not trying to rush.  The issues you - you have identified Chairman as you interrogate them with Mr Thabethe.    I am simply confirming that as an evidence leader.    I make common cause with you.    That is really all.    And - and …    Ja.    And I accept that Mr Thabethe, ja.    But let us go back to page 2-3-9 of HH10.  That is your statement - your affidavit.  Page 2-3-9, your statement or affidavit.  It is the 2017 one.    Correct Chairman.    In fact it is - most of paragraph 12 is on this page.    We have dealt with 12.  We have dealt with paragraph 13.    We are now dealing with the agreement that Estina brought to you.    And that is the agreement of 5 June 2012?    Please correct me if I am wrong my understanding is that the agreement as drafted was then taken to the State Law Advisors.  Am I correct?    Yes and I am at page …    Paragraph 14 Chair.    I will point Mr Thabethe to the actual agreement in a few minutes.    It is just understanding who drafted it.    Leave …    Now Mr Thabethe help me with this one.  I have always understood that where Government enters into contracts - into agreements - Government will draft it in a way - that agreement - in a way that will protect Government.  The other party will not draft it.  Am I wrong about that?    Was there an agreement between yourselves and either Paras or Estina as to who would draft the original affidavit?    Where …?    Now I am interested in your comment that this was really at the end of a process.  I take it that you are indicating that you would have had discussions with them about what should go into the agreement Mr Thabethe?    When you speak of having documents in hand you would have had your own draft agreement and they would have had their own before the final agreement was generated by Estina?    Please explain Mr Thabethe.    Did - do you know whether Paras had anything at all to do with the drafting of this original agreement of 5 June?    The reason that becomes an important consideration Mr Thabethe is because my reading of the Memorandum of Understanding between Paras and Estina is that it is a one year Memorandum of Understanding.  Was that your understanding as well?    The second issue arising from the Memorandum of Understanding was that Estina would be the agent of Paras.  Was that your understanding?    The third issue that arises from the agreement is that Estina would look for business opportunities including in the agricultural sector for Paras.  Was that your understanding?    Just for the sake of convenience the Memorandum of Agreement is in Reference Bundle A.  So it is reference bundle - Reference Bundle A at page 284.    Your mic Mr Thabethe.  Thank you.  I am looking at page 289 of that document where Clause 4 deals with the duties and responsibilities of Estina.  I will not go through all of them    I really do not want to go into all of them because I do not believe it is necessary.  I am just illustrating the point I make about Estina being an agent looking for business opportunities for Paras - the company being Paras.    But let us move beyond this document and of course this particular document - I beg your pardon Mr Thabethe.  I am looking at page 2-9-5 right now and you have Ms Sanjeev Gautam who signed on behalf of Estina and you have Mr Gajinder Kumar who signed on behalf of Paras and though my copy is a poor copy I believe this document was signed in May 2012 but I will correct that if I am wrong if we find a better copy.  The copy I have is rather poor.    In fact if I might correct myself my colleague …    Has just pointed out that if we look at page 285 Chairman.    It says that the Memorandum of Understanding is dated 11 April 2012.    So at least it is in the same - more or less same ballpark period.    Yes Chair.    We will bring it to your attention …    If we do find a better copy.    Thank you.  So again my colleague is making the - the point that at page 286 just to deal with the date.    At page 286 you have under definitions MOU date as meaning and referring to 11 April 2011 being the date of execution of this MOU.    So at least we - we do not need to debate that date.  The agreement - the very first agreement - I am just looking at the cover page which is page 6-1-9 Mr Thabethe.  It is called a Partnership Agreement between the Department of Agriculture Free State Province South Africa and Estina (Pty) Ltd.  Are you there?    Of Reference …    B, Chairman.    6-1-9 of Reference B.    It is actually …    Yes please Chairman.    Do not put them too far away.    Thank you.    The page number is 6-1-9.    Correct Chairman.  6-1-9 is written on the top right hand corner.  Can I ask my colleague - are you good?    Are you good?  Thank you.  So I was just reading the first two entries there.  So it is a confidential document.  It is a Partnership Agreement between the Department of Agriculture Free State Province South Africa and Estina (Pty) Ltd.  I would like to pause there and ask was this by agreement that you would have Estina (Pty) Ltd written here rather than Paras.    And you explained then that because of jurisdictional issues you want to be sue the local partner?    And that is why by agreement you then had …    Formulated it this way?    I am going further down and you say here   I am - that is correct; but you had not identified the land that you wanted to allocate to this farm or had you?    You had not gone through the formalities of acquiring that land as at June 2012?    Who would you have had this discussions with Mr Thabethe and please I ask you this because on my record your visit to the Phumelela Local Municipality was on 12 June 2012?  I do not want to confuse you.  So who did you have these discussions with prior to signing this 5 June agreement?    Two - two things arise Mr Thabethe and I am going to chop them up.    I will start with the beneficiary issue.  My understanding is that as at 5 June there was no formality with regard to who the list of beneficiaries might be.  Please correct me if I am wrong.      Mr Thabethe I want to interrogate the informality of that, I agree with you, you had been to Thembalishe township.      With MEC Zwane at the time and other officials.      To speak with beneficiaries, I agree.      You have had asked them to indicate their areas of interest as you have just said, who wanted cattle, farming, who was interested in poultry etcetera, etcetera.      So this is why I say I am taking issue with the informality of the approach and the status of those people as beneficiaries of a rather important agreement where the formality of registering them as beneficiaries had not been completed.  Are you with me?      You see Mr Thabethe my difficulty with that proposition is that fortunately one can look at the history now and find that to date in law they have never been beneficiaries, yet your intention when you went to see them was to make them beneficiaries of this program.      Thank you Chairman.  I will do that.  All I am communicating Mr Thabethe is they have no legal recourse as beneficiaries, they did not when  you were there in June of 2012 and earlier actually today they do not have a legal document that makes them beneficiaries, but I know your intention from what I have read was that you wanted emerging farmers to be beneficiaries.     You see Mr Thabethe when I look at the face of this document the only beneficiary here is Estina because it is the registered company that is in business with the Department of Agriculture, you would agree with that?      You see Mr Thabethe I am again still looking at the front cover page of the agreement, you have a company  called Zana Investments Pty Limited trading as Mahoma Mobung Dairy Project.  I don’t know if you are able to explain who Zana would have been and what the intention was in setting out the last bit trading Mahoma Mobung Dairy Project.  I fail to understand exactly what this is about.      Can you recall Mr Thabethe who the director or directors in the plural of Zana Investments might have been?      Mr Thabethe the interest I have in this shareholding structure really is quite important and it is important because fortunately we have the benefit of the history what is now – what happened over the years.  As you correctly pointed out earlier government put in money in phases into this project, that is correct?      And the idea was to put 114million into this particular project over a three year period?      The beneficiaries, the 100 beneficiaries of Vrede, Memele and Warden who have no legal standing at all have not seen any benefit from the 114million that you put in, in the first year or the second.  You would agree with that?      I am happy with that.      It is because the issue I want to raise DCJ ...[intervenes]       It is really related to both agreements.      Thank you DCJ.  And that is really the issue around the deviation, because this arrangement, I am still on my page 619, the cover page, which sets out the parties, this arrangement was not done in terms of the SCM policy document that we discussed yesterday.   Your view please?      Please.      Please ask your question Chairman because I know that Mr Thabethe has been waiting for mine since yesterday.     That is correct Chair.     The mic Chairman.      Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe you were in the process of giving an explanation on the deviation, just as an opening gambit, there are a number of issues that arise.      But you were about to start explaining the deviation.      Yes, go ahead sir.      I’m sorry Mr Thabethe, if you could just, we know that there are different sources, it will help us if you are specific about which monies would come for farmers, just with each allocation just explain where it comes from, sorry to interrupt.    Why would you allocate it under transfers?  I do not want you to lose your train of thought sorry but it is important for us to understand that.    No please continue.    But can I – yes you are about to explain what those are.    But can you pause just there please Mr Thabethe.  The process you are describing would have followed on in terms of the SCM Policy in that there would be a bid process, a competitive process etcetera, etcetera.    Again I am going to ask you to pause.  So you are here referring strictly to CASP grants and to Ilima grants.  Are those the ones you are illustrating now?  Where it would come in on – with certain conditions and you simply pass it on?    Which – which part of the PFMA/Treasury Regulations permitted you to gazette it?  I understand the first two the CASP and the Ilima.  The third one I do not quite understand.  It is in terms of which particular regulation that you could do that or provision in the PFMA?    Oh I see.    Yes.    So it is the broader exercise of how you are allocating your budget as a department?    Okay.      But the checks and balances that relate to that type of transfer the CASP and the Ilima transfer is that the National Department monitors and can withdraw?    Those grants.    But let us then talk about the DoRA allocation that would come into Province the vote of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development would be Vote 11, am I right?    Now from Vote 11 you would then have to budget and decide on where you are allocating what you have?    Yes.    Can ..    Now the intention of Section 217 of The Constitution coming down to PFMA Treasury Regulations as we discussed yesterday is to introduce equity into the system.    With DoRA grant help me with that one?  Because I think I more or less grasp the conditional grants.  How – with the DoRA Equitable portion grant how do you monitor the manner in which that money is spent?    Describe any one of those systems that you are referring to?  To help – just to illustrate the point.    I am back at my issue that I raised with you yesterday in a different context about form over substance.  The form being you have done your part.  You have appointed an implementing agent.  You have transferred the money to the implementing agent.  And this is a very good example the agreement with Estina.    They were an implementing agent.  We can deal with the other issues later.    But in this agreement by way of example you then have sub-contractors who can be employed.    What control would the Department have over not only the appointment of sub-contractors but the payment of those sub-contractors?  The verification of their invoices etcetera, etcetera?  You see Mr Doctor Masiteng described this as a something similar to a turnkey project.    Please explain I just want to understand the monitoring how you know you got value for money from that implementing agent you appointed and that your beneficiaries are satisfied customers of the Department?    In the Department whose job was it to monitor that expenditure?  I know it could not be the HOD because he sits right at the top?    On the ground whose function was it to monitor that expenditure?    I know I am moving forward rather rapidly I am still going to come back to the technicality around the deviation.  But can I debate this checks and balances issue.    Ja.    Correct Chairman.    Thank you Chairman.  I was actually going to deal with some of the issues …    That you have been dealing with but that is fine.  I still have more.    Yes.  So the first one Mr Thabethe relates to the question of goods and services and where that asset sits if you are going to comply with the SCM Policy.    Let us take the example one of the witnesses may have mentioned it or I - I might have read about this.  Let us take the example of the Free State Development Corporation.    Thank you Chairman and you will correct me in my interpretation because this is how I understood the situation.  So you - you have the Free State Development Corporation.  We call it the FDC.  Taking over the running of the Vrede Dairy Farm.  I know there is a lot we are still going to discuss but allow me to use this example.    The assets that sit on an and at that dairy farm who do those then belong to because as I understand your evidence they would not belong to the department the goods and services.  So those cattle, the feed, the machinery, the equipment FDC is compelled - my word - to register those items as FDC items but they do not belong to the FDC. Is that not a problem in itself in - in not having a way of dealing with those goods and services as the department - as the department that would own them?    However if you had used part of the provincial allocation to capitalise the project.  So I accept your explanation for (indistinct).  If you had used other money to capitalise the project that money is then used to buy cattle and tractors etcetera.  Those things would normally be called goods and services.    Who owns - and I suppose I am also looking at the context of their being no beneficiaries really for the Estina Project - who owns those items Mr Thabethe between the time that they are purchased and the time the beneficiaries are ultimately registered formally so as beneficiaries?    In circumstances where you have an implementing agent are you calling that person the farmer?    I - I hear you and I will think about what you are saying.  Just to digest and - and try and understand it.  I will grapple with it because I know I can come back and ask again where I still do not have clarity but can I ask a related question?  You see the difficulty with implementing agents is that it is very difficult - it is very difficult to monitor them closely because they are the persons who you transfer the lump sum to.  Am I right?    The lump sum is then used to pay not only for goods.  I will call those the cattle, the tractors etcetera but for services as well.  Where those services are inflated what remedy do you have?  How do you monitor the payment of monies for services that have been inflated?  Now you being the department of course.    Well let us go to a real example and again I am still skirting around the whole Vrede Dairy issue.  We - we will get there.  If you go to the reference bundle page 1-3-7-5.    Oh.  It is D.  It is the last one.    Ja, D.    Are you there?    No - no problem.  It is D for Donald.  You have got it?    If you go to page 1-3-7-5.  You have that?    We will read it in a minute but can you also page across to 1-3-7-8 and then keep your finger on both, if you can keep them both there open.  I have just put my fingers between the pages to keep both open.    And 1-3-7-8.    Because I will go from one to the other.    You recognise of course 1-3-7-8?    You - you see your signature on 1-3-7-5?    Yes.  Maybe we should just start there because it is your document and say that this document was the Confirmation of Completion of Phase 1 of the Project …    In relation to the Vrede Dairy Farm?    And what you have here I think it is better to read this into the record just to be absolutely accurate.  Is you - you write on 18 January 2013 to Estina (Pty) Ltd in Vrede.    Huh-uh.  So you - you would have if not prepared this you would have read this because you signed this document?    What you have said here is in terms of land acquisition - this is January the 18 t h 2013.    Your remark is   Factually what had been registered at the Deeds Office?  Can I give you the context just to remind you because you have not looked at these documents in a while?  Unless you know - you know what - you know it anyway?    No.  Then let me listen.    The lease agreement between?    Okay.  We will come back to that when we    And then on the right hand side.    What does registration mean?  Does it mean it has been conducted and concluded or that simply application has been filed to do an EIA?    And that is the confirmation that you await?    But there is no further work to be done unless of course there are adverse comments from the regulatory authority.    Okay.  Then the feasibility study we will - which we will talk about in greater detail when we find time.  That had been received by the department.    Now we referred to this yesterday and said as - on our records there is the October 2012 feasibility study.    Is that the one you know about?    Oh.    What is the date of the second one?    Just roughly because the only one I have seen in the bundles is the one of October 2012.    This is actually important.    Can we just find it for you and ask you to look at it?    Because we are going to be talking about what monies were paid …    For these services that were rendered.    My apologies Chair.  We will find it in a minute.  Let us continue while my colleagues look for it Chairman.    We will come back to it in a minute.    Let us go to the next item.    The water reticulation, tell us what that is about in the - just read - if you can read the entry on the right hand side.    And who would be applying for those?    So in this instance the implementing agent would have applied for these.    In fact I am - I think I have seen it as a term in the contract.    Then the next item is   Item number …    Please explain “done” to the Chairman.    Yes, but the beneficiary - this is in January 2013.    And the beneficiaries had not been registered yet as at January, the 18 t h 2013.  You had the list but you certainly had not told them what their allocations were or anything like that.  That is the - the substantive issue I keep raising.    What was their reasoning?  What explanation did they give you?    But would it not have been more correct than to say something - you know we like saying work in progress when something is being done but has not been completed.  There could be a better - better way of phrasing it.  Would that not be more accurate because done means you know I have delivered on that particular milestone?    I - can I just debate that with you for one minute?  What had been done?  This is the evidence that has been tendered here at the Commission.  What had been done is that the department had been to Thembalihle and collected a list of beneficiaries.  Then they had also appointed a committee of three …     Ja.      Chairman, I have found it, is in Bundle A it is the July agreement, so it’s reference Bundle A page 11 and then there’s an Annexure as well Mr Thabethe on page 24, please indicate if that’s the document that you think will assist in clarifying this matter. Page 11 and its clause six of he agreement, of the July agreement.      Can I ask you to go to page 24 because this is the agreement that you signed in July of 2012, 5 t h and 7 t h of July.      Chairman we’ll find that, if not today we’ll deal with it next time.      The next item is number eight, item number eight.  No actually we just skipped number seven, so number six said include identified beneficiaries in Agri BEE entity, number seven reads, “Set-up of Agri BEE entity and clarify roles of stakeholders, these being the Department the Agri BEE entity and Estina.  In the right-hand side, what’s your remark there Mr Thabethe?      Then we get to number eight, draw a project plan, in line with Estina proposals with milestones and timelines for phase two as approved by the Department.      Now is that the project proposal or the project – or the business plan?      Then the last item, we’ll come back to you on that one as well, the last item, determine the dates for capital injection by Estina.  What’s the comment or remark on the right-hand side?      Could you explain that and this is as at January 18, 2013?      We can deal with this now or later, what Estina had spent in relation to what you had advanced or in relation to their own contribution of R228million?      Okay we’ll explore that in due course.      Can I interrogate your last statement, R30million was paid in or around July, if it’s not the 9 t h of July it’s the  t h of July, do you agree with that?      No 2012, the first R30million was paid in July of 2012, there was a shortfall of R84million to make up the R114million, would you agree with that?    No, no the R84million was captured but never paid, the R30million was paid but the R84million – you’re correct if you were saying the R84million…[intervention].        I must apologise Mr Chairman, and really Mr Thabethe I’m sorry I wasn’t going to be dealing with the monies now but my juniors are busy feeding me with – here we go, have two sources.  Mr Thabethe I have got actually more than I expected, I think the first one we should look at is reference Bundle B page 458 which is a BCT payment list.      458 Chairman, it’s in Bundle B, the reference bundle, but Bundle B.      You will see you have at the top Estina, the amount that was paid on the 14 t h of June 2012 was R30million are you convinced now or is there something you think is not quite right with the document I’m holding.      Chairman with your leave, we have divided the work that we’re doing on this stream, Mr Thabethe so we have a related stream that we call, money flows, we have not put those documents before the Chairman because we’re still working with the broader concept of money flows.  However Chairman I’ve got a Standard Bank entry here from that stream of work, it’s just not in any of our bundles.    But I’m happy to show is and the entry to Mr Thabethe just so he can refresh his memory and understand, it’s highlighted Mr Thabethe, my colleague will bring it to you, don’t worry.     That’s really just to assist you.  That what’s highlighted at the bottom, please read that at the bottom and we will place it before the Chairman, more appropriately next time we come in.  These are records that were summonsed from the banks and that’s just one of them?     Can I point to one more note Chairman we would like to take it back – can I just point you to one more entry which is a sundry payment advice, it may not be what you are looking for in terms of confirmation, but this one, is found in – again reference Bundle B at page 654 – 654 reference Bundle B.  You will see that, that’s the  cash amount, if you look at the right-hand side R25 400 000 and then another R4.6million signed off by yourself, you have a signature here, HOD.  Do you recall what this might have been about?     Chairman I’ve just consulted with the team and we’ll be able to bring those on Tuesday, we have – just to reassure you Mr Thabethe that the first R30million was paid then the R84million was entered but not paid until a later date when it was paid in three tranches, so I think we’re going to – when we come back, show you that the entire R114million, R30million plus R84million was in fact paid and we’ll show you the dates.     Chairman I notice it’s a minute to five, I can continue with this on Tuesday.     If that’s the date you’ve decided we should…[intervention].     That’s fine Chair. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    All rise. INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
THABETHE: Chair the memorandum of understanding had a timeframe period and this timeframe period was to establish these committees to make sure that becomes operational.  Our reference to the document was to say there is already an established relationship so the two countries are talking to each other.  That is what we were saying here.  We were not saying the country has – get to a stage where we have a relationship that is not bound by timeframes.  And we have attached the document.
