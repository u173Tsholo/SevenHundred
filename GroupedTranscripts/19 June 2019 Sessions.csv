CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody.    Yes.    Oh before you do that.    I must just say that we were supposed to start at ten but because urgent matters that needed to be dealt with relating totoday’s proceedings we were not able to do so that is why we are starting now.  Yes.    Thank you.    No that is fine.  Let us proceed on that basis.  The commission will continue to do what it can to make sure that implicated persons are notified and that they get Rule 3.3 Notices but it does notmean that when we have done all that is reasonably required and we still cannot – and somebody still disputes having received notification that we will never proceed.  There will be circumstances where if I am satisfied that all that we are required to do has been done I may give the go ahead that we proceed but in this particular case I think it is in order that we defer Mr Mahlangu’s evidence until we know exactly what has happened or until further attempts have been made to give – to ensure that Mr Mngadi has received notice.  I understand that all along the commission was under the – at least the evidence leaders were under the impression that he had received a Rule 3.3 Notices.    But he has now indicated that he has not and it is important to establish what the position is.  So that will be in order.  So Mr Mahlangu’s evidence will be deferred until you revert.  Thank you.    Yes.    That is in order.   Yes.    Yes thank you.    That is in order.  But I think I have just paginated it.    That is 330 and 331?    And then 332.    That was 6 May?    Of July?    July okay.    Yes.    Um  I am sorry before you proceed I meant to ask youyesterday.  You have said that you received a lot of pressure from Ms Meyne.    I would like you to articulate in as clear a manner as you can exactly what it is that she was saying to you which you regarded as putting pressure on you on different occasions.    Okay no that is fine those that you have included.  Now of course the – the truth is that there was a certain degree of urgency in finalising – in getting funds for SAA because as you said yesterday the maturity dates for certain loans were coming up soon.      Yes the importance of the question I was asking you is because – is that it is important that I know if the pressure that she put on you was for you to do something wrong something illegal, something un-procedural, something against the policy of SAA ormaybe it was not necessarily pressure to make you do wrong things but it was pressure that you do the right thing but you act maybe with more haste in the light of the emergency.  So it is important that I get the picture as to which pressure you are talking about.  Was it to do something wrong?  To do the right thing and – and to what extent are you basing what you say on what she said and to what extent you are basing what you are saying on your own impressions.  That is why I wanted to know exactly what she said.     So – so what do you say?   Yes.    And would you – would you be able to say or what would you say if she were to say I genuinely believed that those things did not need to be taken to the board.  I would not have asked you to – not to take to the board things that I knew should go to the board. What would you say if she were to come here and say that?    So you say she knew that she was – that the things that she was saying you should not take to the board were things thatshould be taken to the board?    Okay.  Thank you.    What is the page number?   Thank you.    I want to hear more about what you were scared of.  What – what were you – what were you thinking was going to happen?  What were you scared of?    How far – how far to come and talk to you about the – that interview?    And you – you did so?    Hm.    Hm.    And is that all that you were called to Durban to discuss with her?    Hm.    Hm.    Well you – I am sorry.  You do not need to go – to deal with those unless …    They are examples of …   Pressure that was put on you.    Yes, okay.    In – in whose section was that?  In the Chair’s - SAA Chair’s section or in yours?    In your section, oh.   Oh, in finance okay.    Hm.    Okay.  So those are the matters that you – you discussed at least which relates to …    Some of the pressure …    That you say she put – put on you?    Okay, thank you.    You are reading my mind.   I – I wanted to go back to it because …    I – I realised she told me a lot of things but …    We did not get to that but continue.  I think you know exactly what I wanted.    And – and what it is you were scared of as well.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    You mean if you say you can get another job it means you would lose this one and get another one?    Oh.  So when you say you are not scared of losing the job it is because you did not think that you could lose your job at SAA but you are simply saying losing the SAA job was not something you were worried about because getting another job would not be a problem.  Is that what you are saying?    Who is she now?  Who – who was she – who is she that went to – used to go to Sunnyside?    Okay.    So – so in the end what is it that you were scared of there?    Yes.  You – you thought that you could be killed?    And on other occasions when you say pressure was put on you and you were scared what were you scared of?    What did you think would happen and who would do what?  What is it that you were scared of?   Hm.    And did you think that if you did not give – you did not carry out certain instructions or you did not do certain things that you were opposed to doing you could be harmed?    Did you think that if you did not carry out certain instructions with which you did not agree or if you did not do certain things in regard to which pressure was being put on you – you would be harmed?    Okay.  Thank you.   What page is that?       Thank you.      Yes.       Lets – how much time do you…(intervention).      About ten minutes, okay let’s see if we can finish at quarter to twelve.       Ja.       Thank you, yes.       Yes before he concluding remark that you – or remarks that you wish to make.  You said that a cancellation fee is common in this kind of transaction, if I understood you correctly in relation to the raising of funds, did I understand you correctly?      Oh okay, well I thought the question you were being asked was more in relation to the raising of funds, whether a cancellation fee to you knowledge, is common in the industry.      Well as I understand cancellation – the cancellation fee that BnP was talking about, and if your understanding is different you must tell me, as I understand it what they were talking about was that if  SAA cancelled the idea of them raising funds for  SAA, and I seem to think that they were saying that even before any contract could be concluded between themselves and SAA then SAA would have to pay a certain percentage which they gave.  If the cancellation was due to factors beyond their control, is that your understanding as well.  In other words, one,  they were not saying pay us for the work that we have actually done and for the time we have spent on the work and we will give you our timesheets, how much time we spent doing this or doing that in order to try and get funds for you but they were simply saying, we don’t want you to look at how much work we have actuallydone, you’ll just have to accept that we have done some work, how much it took us to do it is neither here nor there but if you cancel and it’s because of reasons beyond our control as BnP then  you must pay such an such a percentage.  That was my understanding of what they were talking about, is your understanding different?       Maybe even before you go there…(intervention).      Well…(intervention).       Well normally if somebody is going to do some work for you, normally you would agree that they will be paid per hour or per day or per month or per week or per year for doing that work and you agree on the rate and that person would then do the work and that person will not be paid if they have not – for an hour that they did not use to do your work or for a month when they were not doing your work unless they are on leave if they are employed but if it’s an independentcontractor they are not going to be paid if they are not doing their work okay but you can have another arrangement.  That is an arrangement where the payment – their payment is not dependant on how much work they have put in, it is dependant on the results, like a commission to say, you asked me to get you 15billion rand, if I get you 15billion rand you will give me 5% of 15billion rand.  Irrespective of whether it has taken me a week to get you the 15 billion rand or a month.  Irrespective of whether I just made one call and got somebody to give you 15billion rand you will give me 5% of that, you understand the distinction?       Now my understanding of what BnP was talking about was an arrangement that is along the lines of a commission that – that’s why it was important for them to talk about a percentage.       Because if you base the payment on hourly rates you have got to talk about an hourly rate not a percentage, you understand?       Yes, so – now my question is whether this understanding I have of how they wanted to be paid, of course with your understanding as well.     Yes but I just go back to what you know to be the norm and I wan this because Mr van der Merwe was asked whether a cancellation fee is a norm in the sector and my recollection is that he said it was not.  So I’m trying to establish that – so when you  said a cancellation fee is a norm in this sector did you – were you talking about a success – what you call a success or what has been referred to as success fee or you were talking about a fee that would be paidunder the circumstances that BnP was putting forward?        So now that I think you have agreed we have the same understanding of what BnP was talking about when they were told about a cancellation fee, what is your evidence is it that it’s a norm for that kind of fee to be charged or is it not?       It is not a norm?       Okay now you also – you told me how Ms Myeni would speak to you about the employment and dismissal of certain employees, somebody must be employed, somebody must be dismissed, you talked about the dismissal in the context of the employee who apparently had failed security clearance and she was the one who raised that issue – Ms Myeni, with you.   Was that an issue that you expected to be raised with you by the Chair of the Board or would that be an issue that you would expect the person you reported to, namely the acting CEO to raise as far as you know is that a matter that the Chair of a Board would really be involved in, in an institution such as SAA Parastatal?       Would it be fair to say that when you made the recommendation that you made to the Board, to approve the cancellation fee in circumstances where you were against the approval on your evidence and you went to the extent of contacting some of the members of the Board with a view to influencing them not to approvethe cancellation fee, would it be fair to say, you sought to balance – to strike a balance between the interests of the company and the interests of your own- your own interests in terms of what you were scared of?       What did you think would happen if you wrote the memorandum and your recommendation was that the cancellation – the Board should not approve the cancellation fee and all the Board members saw that, that was your stance?       Did you not want the Chairperson to know – to see it in writing that you were saying the Board should not approve…(intervention).       When you spoke to the other Board members didyou ask them to keep the conversation between yourselves and each one of them or the understanding – they did understand, the context was such, they did understand that you would not want them to tell the Chairperson what you had said to them?      Yes because you did say what the Chairperson had said to you and you did say what your view was.        Okay, alright anything?       Thank you, I think there is counsel for, I don’t know who that wants to come forward and…(intervention).       Yes I forgot you wanted to say something yes.       No thank you very much for having come to give your evidence, I will still hear more evidence and there may be evidence that will contradict the evidence you have given and I will make findings that I will consider appropriate to make in due course but I do want you to know that we appreciate that you came to give evidence.  There have been other senior manager, executives from Parastatals and people who were employed in high positions ingovernment departments who came and gave evidence and shared with the Commission the  experiences they had – they went through when they insisted that the right things be done and resisted attempts for wrong things to be done and we want to hear from them because we want to know exactly what they may have gone through so that we can see at the end of the work of the Commission what we may need to recommend should be put in place to make sure that people who insist on the right things being done are protected and will not be victimised in any way.  So do encourage others that you know may have something that’s relevant to the terms of reference of the Commissionto come forward and to share with the Commission and with the nation what they know.  I still believe there are many out there who know a lot that happened and they include senior people in government departments, past and present, they include Ministers, deputy Ministers, DG’s, CEO’s of Parastatals, Chief Financial Officers and many others, I believe there are many who are still not coming forward who know a lot that they should be coming forward to share with the Commission and we just need everybody to urge them to do the right thing, to come forward and share all the information and experiences that they had.  So thank you very much but before I release you, I want to hear what counsel has to say in case it needs you, yes thank you.       Okay thank you very much, thank you.  Thank you very much Ms Nhantsi, you are excused.       Thank you.  Well it’s about 12 o’clock.      The tea break is like lunch break, we’ll take the tea break until quarter past twelve, we adjourn.INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    Yes Ms Hofmeyr.    Yes let us do that.    Yes thank you.

Yes.    Ms Hofmeyr I know that some evidence leaders helpwith the spelling of some of these names.    To assist the transcriber.    So that might be useful ja.    Yes.    So the handling part of the business refers to thechecking in of passengers and what else?    Is it like taking the passenger from when he or she checks in up to…    Where he and she …    And the luggage gets put in the plane?    Is it that process?    Okay alright thank you.    That is fine.    Yes. Okay.    When …    When Ms Tlatsana said to you she had not been active in this ground handling business of hers what period was she talking about?    Was it the period to her meeting with you or was she saying even as at the time that she was meeting with you she was still not active in the business?    As you understand her.    So when …    When you met …    Your understanding that – was that she was active in the business?    Hm.    Okay.    Okay, no that is fine.    Before the Valoteck just remind me what wasMr van Wyk’s position at SA Express?    In North West?    Oh.    Nationally?    Ja.   Oh, okay alright.  Thank you.    Ja, you may proceed.    Yes.    Okay.    What services did you understand Valoteck to have been required to render in order to be entitled to this R15 million?    Yes.    But …    But has – had the contract between SA Express and Koreneka been terminated at the time that Valoteck was …    Given the contract?    Yes.   But you said the – you suggested that there was a contract between SA Express and Valoteck and you said it was a cut and paste of the contract between SA Express and - and Koreneka.  Is that – is that what the position was?    Yes.    Yes.    That is between SA Express and Valoteck?    But what is the cut and paste that you were talking about – cut and paste …    Contact you were talking about?   Yes.    Which happened afterwards?    Okay, alright.    Ms Hofmeyr maybe continue.    Yes.   Yes.    Okay.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at 10 past two.  We adjourn.    Are you ready?    Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, no that’s fine, he is excused he can return tomorrow.    Yes, and he returns tomorrow at eight?    Okay, thank you.    Press the other one.  There are two bars there.    The chairperson of?    Okay.   On the recording.    Mmm.   What day of the week would it – was it a Saturday when you met with her?     Yes.    Okay.    Who was that now?    The GM?    Yes okay. MR TIMOTHY NHLANHLA    Yes, yes.    Yes, okay I will take a short adjournment and we will be told as soon as the technical problem has been sorted out.    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNSINQUIRY RESUMES    Yes are you ready?    Thank you.      May I just take you back a little bit.  The meeting between yourself and the owner of Koreneke on that Saturday what did it reveal as the purpose for her wanting you to give you all this information?  Was the position that she was complaining that there were attempts to get rid of her business and bring in somebody else, is that what prompted her to want to approach you?  Or did she say it was simply a concern that maybe money that should be – should stay with her business was being paid out because there were these other people that needed to be paid and she had had enough of it or what had prompted this?   But it came into the account of her company?    But she would have been the one who dispensed it, is it not?    Ja.    Yes.    Okay.  Thank you.    I interrupted you Ms Hofmeyr.    She poured out everything she wanted to say?    Repeating the same things that…   And a lot of it was – had – was in the recording as you…    What was in the recording as you had listened to it?    Okay when she was pouring out?    Yes.    Okay.    Oh [laughing]    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Hm.   At that meeting?    You showed it to them at that meeting?    Ja.  And the meeting was on Monday?    The first Monday after the Saturday meeting with Mr Tlatsana?    Okay.    28 t h of what month?    2015 still?    Was it 2015 of 2016?    16.    Okay.    And the Saturday when you saw Ms Tlatsana?    Tlatsana ja.    Was it June?    Oh okay so it is still the same month?    Okay.  Alright.    And what did you say was her position?    Okay.    Yes okay.    That stuff.    Oh, he left the room?   And never returned?    And she was supposed to go into the room with you?    For purposes of execution.    But did you see her again?    And did you confront her?    To say what happened to you?    In terms of the timing was this after he had disappeared – Mr van Wyk - or was it before?    Long after?    Like two months, three months?    In June?    In July.    But you are still talking about whether to charge himor not.    Hm.    Yes.  I guess you – I guess you are saying that to say there was a lot you had to do.    But I was not asking you because I was thinking youwere slow.  I was just trying …    I was wondering …    I was wondering you would be talking about whether to charge somebody that has – that left about – what – four months previously …    Under the circumstances in which he left.    Anyway yes.    To discuss or to discard?    Oh to discuss, oh.    Still 2016 hey?    Hm.    But was the report not that you had sent to Mr Ntshanga …    Preliminary Report?    Well that – what is confusing me is that you are saying you have completed the investigation …    But you have only prepared a temporary …    Or Preliminary Report.    Yes.    Yes.   Oh, you had completed that part?    Okay.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Okay, okay.    So it was preliminary only insofar as there were other people who you still needed to investigate but insofar as Mr van Wyk is – was concerned it was completed?    It was – it was a final report?    Oh, okay alright.    Oh, okay.    You were to have no further role in the investigation?    Okay, alright.    Thank you.    Before you – you proceed just two – two things.  You say in – under your recommendations you say Mr van Wyk had resigned.  Was that because there was a formal resignation letter thathe – he put in or was that simply because you – you labelled his disappearance and never to return as resignation?    Oh, okay.    Oh, okay and did you recall how soon after his disappearance he put in a letter of resignation, or is something you don’t know?    Mr van Wyk told you?    But you never saw the actual letter of resignation?    Oh you saw it later on.      Oh okay.      Okay just before you proceed I want to understand something, the colleague of yours with whom you had gone to see Mr van Wyk on the day he disappeared, what was the name again – what was her name?     The person who you had gone to…(intervention).    Yes but you – employed by…(intervention).        What was the name again     Yes now as you continued with investigation all these months, did anything happen to her, did anything happen or was she asked in any way to account as to what happened with her in terms of the decision for the two of you to execute what you needed to execute?    Is a higher authority.     Mr Ntshanga?         Around the time of Mr van Wyk’s disappearance?    Okay thank you.        Yes.      All of it?      Had you kept copies?     That’s when you found the recording of the conversation when you, the CEO and …(intervention).          Not that one oh okay.      Okay but you got all the ones that you had lost?      And then you got more and more.     Okay.      I wonder, Ms Hofmeyr whether before you get into that section whether it wouldn’t be useful to kind of sum up what was wrong with Ms Tlatsana’s business did they provide the service butwere paid more than they were supposed to be paid or were they being paid what they were entitled to but she was required to give money to other people but if not now then maybe later on, I thought it might be convenient before you move into another section, just to have a picture of what it is that was wrong.      Yes.      That’s fine.      She said Mr Ntjanga.     Ja that’s fine.       I think what could be done in due course is toreplace it with a clearer copy.      Sorry page 10?      Oh okay.    Yes, it’s very strange.    Because they both relate to the same services.    No that’s fine.  Yeah, that’s fine.    I see that you are making sure.    You don’t make a mistake again.    Nor the agreement between SA Express and Koreneka.    So are you saying that these types of services that fits this description, they fell outside of the agreement between SA Express and Koreneka.    But they did fall within the agreement between Koreneka as Management Company and the Northwest Department of Transport and Community Safety.    Okay, but SA Express was being invoiced for those services?   In terms of the invoice?    Okay.    I think maybe let me put the question this way.  In saying that that description in the invoice falls within the services contemplated in the agreement between Koreneka and the Northwest Department of Transport, are you saying that because you did have a look at that agreement or are you basing your view on something else?    Yeah, but that’s fine that’s one thing but did you have a look at the agreement and saw that it does fit in or you assumed that it does because of what you heard?    Okay.    Okay.    Beyond 10 million.    The need to approach the Board.    So these payments were they all authorised by the CEO or is that something you are not sure about, you might know only one?    On the relevant documents to.    Yes.    All this transactions, ja.    Okay.    Okay.   Yes.    I’m sorry.  So on the basis that the services that were reflected in the invoices for which Koreneka wanted to be paid fall outside of the services that were the subject of the agreement between SA Express and Koreneka?  These payments were all not supposed to have happened?    Yes.    Okay.    So she said she never prepare these invoices and her office never even prepared them or just that she didn’t prepare them?    Yes.   Oh yeah, is that something you- that’s what she told you?    But I assume that suggest that the Department of Transport and Community Service or Safety in Northwest is the one that he was saying had paid the money to SA Express instead of Koreneka.    But if that was the case they didn’t pay back to the person who erroneously paid to them for that person to pay it exactlywhere they were supposed to pay it.  Why were they the ones paying Koreneka?    And it’s not for you to pass it on, you don’t know whether that Koreneka is entitled to it or not and if you pass it on toKoreneka in circumstances where the Northwest Department of Transport says, no but you shouldn’t have done that it’s our money.  What do you say?    Yes.    Yes.  I want us to take a break at 16h30 but if it’s already a convenient time in terms of what you want to ask we can take it now otherwise within 5 minutes.    No, then that’s fine let’s go up to 16h30 that’s fine.    Okay, let’s take a 10 minutes break up to 16h35.    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES    You may proceed.    Ja before – before that – I am sorry to interrupt you.  In your investigation did you ever try and establish whether there wasany correspondence SA Express and the North West Department of Transport relating to this erroneous payment – so called erroneous payment to SA Express of money that was supposed to be paid to Koreneka?     But did you ask the CEO …    If there was and what did he say?    And the notification was not in writing?    Yes.    Okay, alright thank you.    Yes, yes.    Oh that would be the cut and paste that …    Mr Ngwenya …    Was talking about?    Okay.    I think – I think he must charge you a fee now.    Mr Ngwenya – Mr Ngwenya she is counsel you can …    Put your rate quite high.    Yes.    That is fine.    March 2017?    I am sorry.  It might be appropriate to just check.  You may have dealt with this before.  With regard to the Koreneka – it is Koreneka?  The (intervenes).    Ja, Koreneka that company.    Was Ms Tlatsana the only owner/shareholder/Directorthat was in it or is that something you do not know?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.   Oh, okay alright.    Okay …    And I guess Ms Hofmeyr you will also explore the issue of who were the owners/members/shareholders of MAMCO and PAMCO?    Ja.    Of Valoteck?   Ja.    But when you say they are related is that because that is – you know that to be a fact or you just saw the surname that …    It was confirmed, oh.    Okay.    Just raise your voice again.  I know it has been a long day but just try and raise your voice.    That is 18 August 2016?    Check the date?    If you are mistaken.    Okay.  You are too fast.  I think I have missed something.    Please go – go back a little bit.   On that day you received a call and you – you could tell who it was who was phoning you.    Ja, just take it from there.    This was a footage covering what?    Something else.    Okay, alright okay.  We do not need to go into it but…    But it is footage that you were interested in looking at or not really?    Maybe you do not need to …    Okay.  It was a separate thing, ja.    Yes, okay.    Alright.    And you knew Mr Tshabalala before (intervenes)?    Okay.    Ja.    Okay.    Okay.    But from your phone you could tell who the caller was?    Oh.    Okay.    I am sorry and this was in August 2016?    And Mr van Wyk had disappeared on 1 July …    2016?    Okay.  Your investigation was still ongoing?    Okay.   And – and – I am sorry.  When he said the money that was taken out did he – which money was he talking about and being taken out from where?   Yes.    Yes.    Oh, he was saying you must drop the investigation?    Oh okay.   Yes.  No, just before we leave that point the significance in the question Ms Hofmeyr was putting to you whether the word that this person used was siphoned out, money was siphoned out, and you initially said yes, but then you said, he said money that was moved.    Now I want you to indicate whether you are using when you say it was moved you are using the word that this person used or you are using your own word to describe what he said to you.    Okay.    You are expressing it the way you understood it.   Okay no that’s fine.    I’m sorry, it’s quite an important part, so just go back to the conversation, did you greet, you find him there, you greet, and what does he say to you?    I know that it’s been what three years or four years since then, I just want to understand the to’ing and fro’ing of the conversation between the two of you, if possible, but it might not be possible.  You say this money, this investigation that you are involvedin, that you are conducting concerning Mr van Wyk, concerns money that was moved from the Northwest Government which was meant for funding ANC activities.    And does it say you must drop the investigation or what happened, I just want to follow how the conversation between the two of you ...(intervention)     For the duration of your discussion with him were the two other people that before you came to talk to him had seemed to be with him, were they with him or were they in the vicinity or were they no longer there?    And you don’t know whether when you finished they were there or not?    Yes, okay.    Yes, thank you.  Would there have been cameras to capture you and this man talking about the R3million bribe that would have been there?    Because of the timeline.    What’s the time lapse, what’s the time within which one has got to get them before they lapse, before they  become unavailable?    Two and a half years or so from August 2016 isn’t it?    We are two and a half years or so away from the date when this incident occurred in August 2016, isn’t that within time?    Is that so?    And you’re sure of that.    Yes, I’m wondering why you might not have considered it necessary soon after the encounter with this man to tryand at least get his picture because this was somebody who was – who sought to bribe you.    You’re both in the security sector.    So Mr Jason Tshabalala would know the identity of this person that you met ...(intervention)     Because he is the one who arranged for the two of you to meet.    Yes, but did you ever ask him what’s the name of that person you wanted me to meet, did you ever ask Mr Tshabalala?    Yes but that was at the time before you met the guy.    I mean after you had met the guy did you go back to him to say ...(intervention)    Mmm, I would have thought that he would want to talk to somebody who sent somebody who sought to bribe you?    Ja, and the number that he used to call you would it still be available somehow?    Okay, no that’s fine.  Thank you very much for having come to give evidence in the Commission, we have had over the past two days or so, or three days, I’m not sure, no two days, two days, three people, two of whom are past officials of a parastatal who have given evidence about what happened at SAA and so on and today you have also given evidence about things that happened at S A Express, and you dealt with investigations that relate to taxpayers money being diverted away from where it should go, so thank you very much.  You may be asked to come back in the future, and I have no doubt you will come back if you are asked but thank you very much for coming to share your evidence with the Commission, and you are excused.   We are done?    Yes tomorrow we are going to start at eight o’clock and we will go up to eleven o’clock because for the rest of the day I will not be available, so we are starting early to try and make use of whatever time is available and then on Friday we will start at some stage later than usual, but I will indicate maybe tomorrow what time wewill be looking at.  We will adjourn then for today and then tomorrow e start at eight.  We adjourn. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Morning Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Chair before we continue with the evidence of Ms Nhantsi I would like if I may …    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Chair before we continue with Ms Nhantsi’s evidence I would like to place on record certain facts in relation to the endeavours to communicate with implicated persons that were undertaken yesterday after your direction that those steps should be taken.  Chair the consequence of taking some of those steps is that contact was sought to be made with Mr Mngadi who was implicated inMs Nhatsi’s evidence and was to be implicated in Mr Mahlangu’s evidence.  Those efforts were made and no telephonic communications – spoken communication was successful with Mr Mngadi.  But there was communication received from him this morning to our investigators who had made the efforts yesterday to contact him.  Our move into what that communication indicates in a moment but just to recap the position we were in yesterday.  Yesterday’s position as I relayed it to you Chair was that at least in relation to Ms Nhantsi’s evidence there had been Rule 3.3 Notices sent to implicated persons including Mr Mngadi.  The communication that was received from him this morning indicates that on his side he disputes having received any of that notification prior to Ms Nhantsi’s evidence.  Chair the consequence of that is the need for further investigation particularly on our side to understand precisely what did happen when.  But in the consequence – in a consequence in which there is communication from Mr Mngadi in which he disputeshaving received any notification prior to the evidence at all.  It is our proposal that we take steps to uncover what the factual state of affairs is and take all steps necessary to ensure that Mr Mngadi receives copies of the relevant statements and affidavits and in particular in relation to Mr Mahlangu that we stand down his evidence until we can report back to you on the status that has been established in relation to Mr Mngadi.      Indeed.    We are indebted to you Chair.  Then just interms of today’s proceedings our proposal is to conclude the evidence of Ms Nhantsi and then to move to the next investigation area actually     We are in the fortunate position that we had anticipated with some optimism I expect that we would be able to get there today in any event.  We have run longer with some of the witnesses but we will just – our proposal is to just move seamlessly into that area of investigation with the two witnesses who will start off the second focus area.    Thank you Chair if we may then commence with the further questions for Ms Nhantsi?  Ms Nhantsi overnight you were requested to try and find the letters that you had referred to where you had followed up with BNP about the FSP licence.  You handed those to me this morning, is that correct?    Thank you.  I would like to take an opportunity to hand them up Chair if I may?    And provide you with a copy.    Ms Nhantsi and then we will go through them.  Chair my proposal is that we add it at the end of Ms Nhantsi’s bundle.  If we were to do so it would commence with the pagination 330.  We can take steps over the break to paginate your file accordingly if that isin order?    Thank you we are indebted to you for that.    And then there is a 332.  You should have a third page.    Yes.  Ms N�<äØ�= if you will just make those pagination notes as well so we can be literally on the same page when we are dealing with it.   So Ms Nhantsi if we can just start there.  This – you referred in your evidence yesterday to communication with BNP Capital on I think it was the 13 July in which you raised a query about their statement at the time that they had previously alerted you to the suspension of the their FSP licence, is that correct?    And can you tell the Chair what this letter then contains?    July.    Ms Nhantsi can I clarify that you did not then receive the confirmation that a prior communication had been sent on the 13 May after this letter was sent?    So as you have the facts that was not received on the 13 May by SAA?    Thank you.  Ms Nhantsi I would then like to conclude on some aspects in relation to the cancellation fee but before we get there I wanted to just be clear on some of your evidence yesterday.  One of the questions we probed was your knowledge of Mr Mngadi’s association with Nedbank which you indicated you were aware of from early early on.  What I was not clear on in relation to yourevidence is when precisely in time to the extent that you know it Ms Meyene would have been aware that Mr Mngadi was associated with BNP Capital?  When about would that have occurred?  And just to help you on the chronology BNP Capital gets appointed as transaction advisor on the 20 April.    They are then appointed to source funds on the 25 May.  What I am interest in to the extent that you know it all is whether prior to or in that period Ms Meyene would have known that Mr Mngadi was representing BNP Capital?    There is one email communication however    Which you have provided us with.   If we can find it in your file.  Well certainly the sms – the Whatsapp communications refer to engagements that Mr Mngadi is having with Ms Meyene around the sourcing of funds.     So at least at that point and as I have it those begin around the 31 May would you regard it as the case that Ms Meyene would have known of his involvement then?    Yes indeed.    So that is an email to yourself and to Ms Meyene from Mr Mngadi is that correct?    And the acting CEO.  It is the four of you and it relates to the sourcing of funds?    Which at that stage or was contracted to BNP?    So would you be comfortable with the assertion that at least at those periods in time end of May and continuing thereafter Ms Meyene would have been aware of his role in BNP?    But you do not know for a fact whether she wasaware of that prior to that point?    And just for the record I take it that when those decisions were made in relation to the extension of scope of the transaction advisor to source funds and the board voted on that Ms Meyene did not declare any conflict of interest in relation to that decision?    Thank you.  If we may then just return to theconclusion of your evidence on the cancellation fee Mr Nhantsi.     As I understand your evidence of yesterday you regarded the cancellation fee as a scheme perpetrated by Ms Meyene with the assistance Mr Mngadi to enrich themselves, is that a correct reflection of your evidence?    You also were receiving sustained pressure to push through the approval of the cancellation fee, is that correct?   And you accept I take it that if it had been approved it would have cost SAA R50 million if the funding had not come to bear fruit?    Um…    Ja.  Now if she were to say yes she did put pressure on you but the pressure she put on you was legitimate because as chairperson of the board she needed to make sure that SAA did not find itself in a situation where those maturity dates arrived and there were no funds and disaster would then happen.  What would yousay?    Ms Nhantsi just a few follow up questions in relation to that engagement with the Chair if I may.  Do you know whether Ms Meyene knew about the provisions of Section 66 of the Public Finance Management Act which require the Accounting Authority of any SOE to approve any borrowing by that SOE?    Section 66.    Of the PFMA.    Says borrowing decisions by any public entity must be done by the Accounting Authority and in the case of SAA thatis the board.    The board is the accounting authority.  Would Ms Meyene do you know whether Ms Meyene would have known of that legal provision?  It is referenced in the funding policy of SAA amongst other places?    Was it ever discussed at the meetings that the board always would have to approve borrowings?    It certainly one of her duties as a board member.    To know of the applicable legislation, is it not?    And may I ask also in relation to what was lawful or not at the time about the National Treasury’s instruction note of 3 of 2016/2017.  Ms Nhantsi you gave to me yesterday morning before your testimony an extract from it. Overnight I was able to source the full notice Chair and Ms Nhantsi you will find it in your file and it – that is DD2 and it commences at page 324.      3-2-4.    Chair this is a note that actually came up in the Eskom evidence in relation to Brakfontein.  So that is why I have any familiarity with it.  It is an interesting practice note because it comes out in April 2016.  It is made operative from 1 May but you will see from the heading what it was directed at was Preventing and Combatting Abuse in Supply Chain Management System. So this is National Treasury in mid-2016 directing all public entities and departments under the PFMA about certain constraints thatthey were placing on the decision making that Boards of SOEs for example could take and one of those constraints you will find at page 3-2-7.  It is under Section 9. This was also the provision that was relevant in the Eskom evidence.  What it required is that if there was to be an extension of any existing contract above 15 percent of the value of that contract there would have to be prior written approval from National Treasury for that expanded contract to be concluded.  Ms Nhantsi was the Board made aware of this at the time that they decided to expand the scope of BNP to include sourcing of funds?    1 May, yes.    But was it known to the Members of the Board that this was a requirement?    Well it is a National Treasury instruction to all accounting officers of departments and constitutional institutions.  So you – you do not know whether SAA was alerted to the existence of thisnotice?    But if anyone received it – it would have been the Chairperson of the Board?    Thank you.  Are you satisfied that the expansion of the scope of BNP Capital’s contract would have been within the ambit of this practice note and consequently ought to have obtained the written authority and approval of National Treasury before it was concluded?    Ms Nhantsi if we can then go back – I wasconcluding on your evidence in relation to the cancellation fee.  The pressure that you – was exerted on you and which you have clarified to the Chair and your understanding at the time that it was untoward the insistent of the payment of the cancellation fee. Ms Nhantsi were you aware at the time of your obligations under the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act?    Were you aware at the time that you recommended to the Board that they approve the cancellation fee that you had certain obligations under the Prevention and Combatting ofCorrupt Activities Act to report any knowledge of or suspicion that acts of corruption, fraud or theft were taking place in a company?    So you accept that you are a – in a position of authority in relation to SAA?    So why did you not take those steps that are required of you to be taken under Section 34 of that Act?    So you accept that you breached your legal obligation under Section 34 of that Act?    Ms Nhantsi do you accept that you did not act in the best interest of SAA when you recommended approval of the cancellation fee?   Ms Nhantsi it is – in fairness I must put this to you for your comment.  What you could have done I would like to suggest to you to protect the best interest of SAA was to prepare that submission on 4 July that you prepared to notify the Board that there had been this request for a cancellation fee from BNP to set out under Point 2 of that template how it had been motived and under Point 3 of that template headed “Recommendation” acting in the best interest ofthe company would have been to recommend that it not be approved. A, because there was no basis for it.  B, because it would be a cost that would not justifiably be borne by the company in its precarious financial position and C, because you were highly suspicious at that stage of the circumstances surrounding it.  What is your comment in response?    Ms Nhantsi just two follow up questions in relation to that State Security Agency vetting.    When did that occur?    And who in SAA was vetted by the State Security Agency?    Did you regard it as strange that 100 people at SAA were being vetted by the State Security Agency?    Hm.    Hm.    Did your position ever require you to receive top secret documents?    And I have it from your statement that you were told the basis on which Ms Olitzki had failed her state security vetting.     Did you regard there as being something more behind Ms Myeni’s instruction to use a dual citizenship issue to removeMs Olitzki from the Finance Department?    And did you raise that all with her?    And then just too clarifying relation to the Chair’s earlier question.  He was engaging with you about how – in what respects you felt scared and then you told us about this increasing pressure and the different instances of it.    Yes Chair.    I am sorry.    Hm.    Indeed.  Can you clarify for us what constituted your fear because there seemed to be a range of options?  It may have been that you – your job would have been on the line.  It may havebeen different types of fear that you were experiencing.  In one of your answers you referenced not being in Johannesburg and feeling uncomfortable.  Can you please try and enable us to understand what that fear was like?    And just to clarify was there ever a direct threat to you to harm you?    Ms Nhantsi I would like to go to the question of Ms Stimpel’s suspension.    And I propose to deal with it briefly.  It occurred on 5 July 2016 and the reason that you gave Ms Stimpel in her suspension notice on the day for suspending her was that she had    My first …      Chair you will find it in the Stimpel bundle it’s DD1B and it’s at page 570.      Ms Nhantsi you’ll see that at the end of the first paragraph, you notify her that she’s suspended from work for an investigation and/or the outcome of a disciplinary hearing which includes, amongst others, the stated reason at the time was removal of company confidential tender documents without permission fromprocurement, you see that?      Did you take this decision on your own or were you instructed to take it, to suspend Ms Stimpel?      Ms Nhantsi in your evidence yesterday, you made some reference to your concerns around confidentiality ofprocurement documents, do you recall that?      You made some comments about the confidentiality of procurement documents, do you recall that?      It’s in the context of  your evidence where we were probing whether you could have asked for the underlying bid submissions when you were asked to recommend  the appointment of BnP after the tender, do you recall that?      I recall in your evidence, you said, you thought there was a provision of the Supply Chain Management Policy that set-out that those documents are confidential and so you couldn’t have seen them, do you recall that?      But we probed it and as I have your evidence you accepted the fact that if you had wanted to see them as somebody who’d been asked to recommend that decision you would have been entitled to see the, do you accept that?      Correct and that’s useful because then we don’t need to go to the Supply Chain Management Policy, I did that overnight and I certainly could find no provision that said a decision maker in SAA who is asked to make a decision on a procurementprocess cannot have access to the bid documents, so we agree on that?      Yes Ms Nhantsi they signed confidentiality agreements because in terms of the policy they may not divulge the contents of any bid to any bidder, in other words, external parties to SAA.      Well that is not in the policy and as I understand your evidence you regarded your role as to be responsible for ensuring proper process in SAA is that correct?     So did you consider the policy yourself?      Okay so will you accept that the policy does not say, anywhere, that people in a decision making role within SAA may not have access to the underlying bid submissions in respect of which they are asked to make a decision?      So was it that understanding that motivated you to suspend Ms Stimpel on the 5 t h of July on that basis?      Ms Stimpel’s evidence was that you instructed her not to attend a National Treasury meeting on the day because you were concerned that she was going to share those documents with National Treasury, did you say that to her?      And Ms Stimpel’s evidence is that she asked for an opportunity to explain the circumstances under which she took the documents on the day, and you did not afford her that opportunity.  Do you accept that?      But you don’t dispute that you might have?      Ms Nhantsi there’s one small final aspect and then my concluding propositions to put to you.  Chair I’m receiving notes that we  have surpassed the tea time, I wasn’t on track because of our slightly later start, it shouldn’t be many more minutes with Ms Nhantsi, I’m in your hands, we may want to complete it and then take the tea break.      Ten minutes.      That will be helpful Chair, thank you, we’re indebted because there will be a new witness and we can use the tea time to change over.      Ms Nhantsi, in your statement you dealt with the circumstances around the suspension of Dr Darwa?, I would like to just deal with it briefly.  You suspended him a few days after you joinedSAA is that correct?      And I take it a consequence of you doing it so shortly after you arrived, that you didn’t at the stage that you suspended him know whether the charges against him were valid or not?      When you suspended Dr Darwa, had you investigated whether the charges against him were valid or not?      Thank you Ms Nhantsi, that’s all we wanted to get clarity on, Dr Darwa will be one of the witnesses but you didn’t have knowledge of the veracity of the charges against him when you handed him the suspension letter?      Thank you, Ms Nhantsi I would then, in conclusion simply like to draw out the essence as I will submit it is of your evidence and give you an opportunity to comment, it will be brief I think my note is that there’s about seven strands of it which are of particular importance it will be our submission to the work of the Commission so if I may do that.  Ms Nhantsi your evidence I suggest toyou for your comment indicates that there was extrodinary pressure brought to bear on you to support decisions in the financial interests of a third party, do you accept that?      Your evidence also seems to indicate that there was a behind the scenes scheme between Mr Mngadi of Nedbank and Ms Myeni to enrich themselves at the expense of SAA.      Your evidence also seems to indicate that Ms Myeni shared confidential company information with M Mngadi.     That Ms Myeni used State security vetting to seek to remove employees that she did not want in certain positions.      That Ms Myeni instructed that persons be appointed in positions without foundation.      And that you heard from Ms Kwinana that Ms Myeni used to make false whistleblowing reports against employees that she wanted out of the way.      Ms Nhantsi if  Mr van der Merwe’s evidence is correct and Grissag had occurred no costs whatsoever in their work on the funding opportunity at SAA do you accept that the entire motivation from BnP to be paid the cancellation fee amounted to a fraud on SAA?     And I have it from your evidence that you accept that you failed to report a corrupt activity or a suspicion that one had taken place in relation to the cancellation fee at SAA.      Thank you Chair, unless there if further from you.       No thank you Chair.   It is indeed Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Chair we now move the focus of the evidence in the aviation stream to a transaction that took place between South African Express and the North West Department of Transport.  And we will hear evidence over the next number of days from witnesses related to that focus area of the investigation.  Our first witness is Mr Timothy Ngwenya.  Prior to calling him up Chair if I may request an opportunity for the legal representatives of certain parties who have an interest in the evidence placing themselves on record.    Thank you Chair if I may call Mr Ngwenya to take up a seat at the witness table.   Chair just for record purposes Mr Ngwenya’s affidavit and annexures can be found in Exhibit DD5 if we may give it that reference for the record?    Thank you Chair if I request for the witness to be sworn in?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Ngwenya just orientateyou in front of you on the table is the file containing your affidavit and annexures.  It will be to that file that I will refer in the course of your evidence.  And where relevant if at any point you need assistance with reference to a document you can indicate that to me and I will assist you with that.  But my proposal for receiving your evidence today is to really take you through the affidavit but ask you to account the story as accurately as you can and where relevant we can go into the documents.  Mr Ngwenya if we can start with your background.  You set that out if we go to page 1 of the file.  You will see the pagination in the top right hand corner of the pages.  And you talk in paragraph 1 in particular about your background within South African Express.  Can you please tell the Chair what that comprises?    And Mr Ngwenya maybe bring that even closer.    If that would be of assistance.    Thank you.      Thank you Mr Ngwenya.  Just for record purposes you have produced an affidavit for the commission.  Ordinarily when witnesses prepare statements we begin by asking them to confirm the correctness but this is an affidavit and in that case you have already done so by deposing to it before a commissioner of oaths. I do however understand from you that there are one or two corrections you would like to make in the affidavit and my proposal is to deal with them when we get to them in the course of the evidence.     Mr Ngwenya at page 2 of your affidavit you talk about your reporting lines within SA Express can you please tell us about that?    At the time indeed.    Yes.    That may be useful.    Indeed.  Just to give it is Merriam, Merriam and then the surname Mochoele is Mochoele.  Thank you Chair.    Mr Ngwenya if I may just interject there.    Could you give us clarity as to who the people are that you are referring to?  So who was the woman who contacted you on the 24 June 2016?    Just to interrupt there I do apologise but for the purposes of the record that is Babadi and Tlatsana is Tlatsana.  So she contacted you and she – as I have your evidence wanted to report corruption related to somebody within SA Express.  Who was that person that she identified?    Thank you.  And that is Brian, Brian, Tebogo, Tebogo and Van Wyk, Van Wyk.    Mr Ngwenya.    If I could just interrupt there sometimes you will have a lot of background knowledge that we may not have.    So do forgive me.  But you say she was Kereneka was the handling company.    For SA Express can you just explain to us what that means?    And Mr Ngwenya where were those services being provided, the ground handling services?    Both located in the North West?    And just for the record again Koreneka which is not an obvious word to spell is Koreneka.    So Mr Ngwenya you identify Ms Tlatsana on that Saturday morning and she introduces herself and then as I have your statement we now at page 3 at least your affidavit at page 3 you then go on to recount what Ms Tlatsana told you in that meeting.  And can you summaries for us what that was?    Mr Mgwenya if I may just come in there.  Before we get to your movements on the day.    What I would like to just to conclude with is the full extent of the story that she told you about what had transpired after Koreneka was appointed to do this ground handling service at the twoairports.  But Chair just for the record purposes Mr Ngwenya’s evidence relays what Ms Tlatsana told him but Ms Tlatsana will be giving evidence in due course so there will not be a concern.    About a hearsay aspect there.    But if we can just go back Mr Ngwenya if I can locate you at page 5 of your affidavit.    Because you will see at the first paragraph there you cover the point you have already given in evidence about Mr Van Wyk saying to her that she would not be successful in the conclusion of the contract unless she had more people in the company.    And there he proposes Ms Joyce Phiri and MrVictor Thabeng.  And if you then go to paragraph 15 you talk there about the conclusion of the agreement as she relayed it you and the level of her involvement after that point in the ground handling services of the company.  Could you deal with those two aspects?    Mr Ngwenya.    In terms of other appointees.    At paragraph 15 you talk about the appointment of Mr Kalisilira that is Kalisilira.    There is another appointment that you refer to in paragraph 16 and that relates to Mr Phiri and what he was going to do and Ms Dube.  Can you take us through what she recounted to youabout those two people?    And Mr Ngwenya who did she relay to youappointed the ground handling staff?    And then if you turn over the page to page 6 you talk there – you enquired from her as I have your affidavit about the invoicing under the agreement and the extent of her involvement in that. Can you tell us what she relayed to you about that?    Yes.    Yes paragraph 17.    Where I am picking it up is in the middle of that paragraph.    Where you say she further mentioned that she did not put any claims either to SAA – sorry SA Express nor the department.    I remember long after I had met her she asked me about the process of invoicing at SA Express.    Thank you.    Mr Ngwenya you at paragraph 18 then relay how she explained to you that a conflict arose at a point in herengagements with Mr van Wyk.  Can you take us through that conflict?    And then Mr Ngwenya at paragraphs 18 and 19 you in a sense jump forward …    And tell us what happened over time when steps were taken to replace Koreneka with other entities in relation to ground handling?  Can you take us through that and then we will go to the topic of the recordings that you have referred to points in yourtestimony already but just to complete the picture at 18 I have that she says conflict develops between Mr van Wyk and herself after she dismisses Ms Dube and then if you can take us further in time from that in relation to the replacement of Koreneka.    And then you made reference to Valoteck.  I understand that to be name of a company.  Is that correct?    The full name is reflected on one of the agreements attached to your affidavit.  It is Valoteck and that is V-A-L-O-T-E-C-K Facilities Management CC.  Is that correct?    So as I have your evidence at some point Koreneka is replaced by Valoteck …    Pursuant to a decision by Mr van Wyk.  That is what is relayed to you.  Is that correct?    And what happens thereafter?  Is Valoteck then thereafter replaced itself?   Thank you and then after Valoteck – at paragraph 19 you talk about the fact that your later investigations indicated that Valoteck had been paid an amount of 15 million by the department but had rendered no services.  Is that correct?    And you conclude paragraph 19 by indicating what happened in the end to Valoteck.  What – what were you able to establish in relation to Valoteck?    Hm.    Mr …    Indeed.    Chair if I may just because one of the challenges with this part of the investigation is there are numerous companies that replace each other within a blink of an eye.    What we will do is we will go through each of those agreements …    But …    What – what I understand of your evidence Mr Ngwenya and Chair I note that we are at the lunch break but if we could just conclude on this point.    Before doing so.   There are just two things I want to clarify Mr Ngwenya.  You – I understand your evidence to be there was an agreement for ground handling services concluded between South African Express and Koreneka.    Correct?    That was in about April 2015.  Correct?    Subsequent to that when there – after there is this conflict that develops between Mr van Wyk and Ms Tlatsana a replica agreement is signed and concluded now between SA Express and this company called Valoteck.  Is that correct?    Now let us just bring labour broking services in because it gets quite confusing.  As I understand your evidence in the course of your investigation the only evidence you could find within SA Express of an actual award of any contract to Valoteck at all related to some quotation that was sought for labour brokering services.  Is that correct?    And then my final point of clarification.  You mention Ms Dube in the context of Valoteck …    But we need to unpack that a little bit because we had heard about Ms Dube in Koreneka.    So I understand your evidence it was when Ms Tlatsana dismissed her …    From Koreneka that the conflict between Mr van Wyk and Ms Tlatsana arose as she recounted it to you.    So what – what happens to Ms Dube?  Where does she feature again?    Of Valoteck?    Thank you.    Thank you Mr Ngwenya.  Were you able to establish any relationship between Ms Dube and Mr van Wyk other than her appointment initially in Koreneka?    Indeed.    Chair just to assist those who are not as familiar with the facts as Mr Ngwenya is.    He has made reference to MAMCO and PAMCO.  They are subsequent companies …   Who received the same ground handling services agreement …    But we will come to them in the course of the evidence.     Indeed Chair, thank you.      Chair just one procedural aspect before wereturn to Mr Ngwenya’s evidence if I may.      Our second planned witness for today is Mr Piri.  We have engaged with him about the possibility of an early start tomorrow.      Which he can conveniently make.      It is my estimation that he won’t start today that the idea would be to complete Mr Ngwenya’s evidence and in thelight of that we request that he be excused to return tomorrow.      Thank you Chair.      At eight o’clock, that’s the arrangement, thank you.      Mr Ngwenya we were just about to turn to page 7 of your affidavit before the lunch break, so I would like us to start there if we may.  This is where you start to detail the audio recordings and documents that you were provided with by Ms Tlatsana, can you take us through what you were handed by her on that day that you met over the weekend in June?  Oh Mr Ngwenya if you will turn on the microphone, just press that.  Oh.    There you go.      Thank you Mr Ngwenya, not at all.        Thank you.      No I was checking, I would have referred you to it if there was something in your affidavit that you’d neglected tomention.  Mr Ngwenya at paragraph 20 on page 7 you talk about the sum total of the amounts that those bank statements reflected had been received by Koreneka.  What are those amounts?      We will go into that in due course.      So in total R51million is that right?     And if we then move to paragraph 21, in paragraph 21 you start to recount the events that then unfolded after that weekend from Monday the 27 t h, can you take us through what steps you took on that Monday?    Mr Ngwenya if I may just there to locate you in your affidavit, we are at page 8, and it’s paragraph 24, because there you are recounting what was specifically said in relation to that recording that you’re dealing with at the moment.      What I would like you to just be clear about is when you say the recordings implicated people in what conduct were they implicated?    And Mr Ngwenya there were other people mentioned on that audio recording, Chair just to facilitate the remainder of the evidence we do have the recordings and the proposal is to have them played during the evidence of Ms Tlatsana because she was in those conversations.    But we’re getting in a sense the bigger picture of the story through Mr Ngwenya’s evidence, and so Mr Ngwenya if wecan take you to paragraph 24 you list there the other people who were implicated in the audio recording, could you please read for us who those individuals are? MR TIMOTHY NHLANHLA    And that particular recording where did you understand it was taken?    And Mr Ngwenya just to be clear how were these individuals implicated in the recording, because I understood you to say the CEO and the Chairperson had been implicated as having given instructions in relation to these transactions, how were these other individuals implicated on the record.    Mr Ngwenya I do apologise for interrupting.  Chair we have been told that there is a need for some technical matter to be attended to, I wonder if a short adjournment might be possible, particularly if it relates to the recording, we need to get that right.    Thank you Chair.    Indeed Chair.    Thank you.  Mr Ngwenya we were dealing with how precisely the persons referred to on the recording were implicated in the dealings between the North West and South African Express and Koreneka and as I have it just before the break you were detailing how there had been some discussion of the amounts that were to be paid to these individuals, is that correct?   So was your understanding that they were implicated insofar as they had been recipients of funds out of monies that had been paid to Koreneka, was that your understanding?    Not at all Chair.  So we were dealing with how these people were implicated that were referenced on the audio recording and as I have it you relayed that to the CEO and the GM of legal in that meeting on the Monday, is that correct?    And then if we go to paragraph 25 on page 8.    You were testifying earlier Mr Ngwenya that you made an undertaking to Ms Tlatsana that she would be phoned.    So that she knew that this matter had been taken up by the highest authority within SA Express, is that correct?    And then as I have it at paragraph 25 you detail the precise call that you did then make to Ms Tlatsana?    Can you take us through that?    Mr Ngwenya by whom?    That [indistinct].    Right.  But you did obtain.    Ms Tlatsana was at this stage recording many conversations.    But you did subsequently obtain that recording from her did you not?    Yes.    Hm.    Mr Ngwenya     You have that conversation it is in two partsand it is recorded as I have it you got those from her later.  But if you go to page 9 of your affidavit you will see that towards the bottom of that page paragraph 28.    You talk about how seriously you took the allegations and what you then said to Mr Ntshanga in the light of what had been recounted to you previously and on the call.  What did you say to him?    Of course.    Yes just for the record if we may?  Chair there is a photocopy of that document which appears as Annexure 1 so it willbe behind Tab 1 at page 32.  This is also a document Chair that we propose to deal with in Ms Tlatsana’s evidence.    Because she was actually presentl    As we have her evidence as this was being drawn out.    By Mr Van Wyk.    But it did come to Mr Ngwenya when those documents were first handed over.    And absolutely you are correct there is an interaction you have with Mr Ntshanga.    About the handwriting on this page, is that what you wanted to go to?    Thank you.    And Msr Mgwenya just to be clear PRECCA is the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act is that right?    Thank you.    So you advised him to make a report?   In accordance with the obligations set out in Section 34 of that Act, is that right?    And then if you pick it up at the bottom of page 9 paragraph 28.    I understand that Mr Ntshanga then suggested you should investigate the matter, is that correct?    And what was to be the scope of the investigation?    Hm.    Indeed.    And Mr Ngwenya I then have your affidavit to be picked up at page 11 because some of what is still contained on page 10 you have already dealt with in your oral testimony.  But what you say at page 11 paragraph 33 is you talk about as I have it after the conclusion of that meeting what you then started to do still on that same Monday to further investigate the matter.  And Mr Ngwenya just to frame the next bit of the evidence.  As I have it you start with the legal department.    You then go and make enquiries of the financedepartment and then you engage with procurement.    So if we could take each of those in order.  What do you seek to establish with the legal department first?    Mr Ngwenya …   Mr Ngwenya I would like us to go to that email if we may?      You will find it under Annexure 3 it is page 36, 36.      And you will see at the top of that page I take it the forwarding that Ms Mkentane engaged in to get the draft agreement to you as well as the email that is contained lower down on that page.  And that is an email as I read it of the 10 April 2015, is that correct?    And who is it from and to?    Yes.    And copied…    And copied to Ms Mkentane.   What I am interested in in relation to that email Mr Ngwenya is what Ms Mochoele says to first of all Mr Allenby because she first of all asks that somebody in his department look at the attached agreement to ensure it is sufficiently and appropriately captures what needs to be captured.    She says it is still very much a draft.  We will still need to polish it up.    However in the interest of time I suggest that your department also have a look at it at this stage.  That person can work with Nasiphi who will be responsible for finalising the draft.  And then what does she say at the bottom @brian – what do you understandthe @brian to mean?    Right and what does she say there?    Hm    Right and then if we can return to your affidavit and we are now at page 12 the top paragraph there 35.  You deal there with your impression of the email.    Can you tell us what your impression was at the time?    And Mr Ngwenya at paragraph 36 on the samepage you then talk about your next step as I have it and the sequence was to go to the finance department.  What did you want to establish there and what did you establish?    And Mr Ngwenya we will go to those payments in detail.    They total the R31 million that you were concerned to uncover the sort of tracking of the funds out of SA Express.    But before we get to that just at the conclusion of paragraph 36     You are able to establish how Koreneke came onto the SAPS system of SA Express.  How did that happen?    Hm.    Thank you.  Mr Ngwenya we will come to yourinvestigation as to whether there was a basis for that payment but before we get there if we may you do this engagement – or you have this engagement with the finance department on the 28 June.    You only go to the procurement department a few days after that but what I would like to do in the middle is just talk about what happened on the 1 July because there were certain plans in anticipation in relation to Mr Van Wyk and then Mr Van Wyk took certain steps in so far as his relationship with SA Express is concerned.  Can you tell us what that is?   Mr Ngwenya you do not have any direct knowledge of that advice been given.  Do you?    You do not know for a fact …    That that advice was given?    Thank you.    Mr Ngwenya you were thereafter asked to write up charges against Mr van Wyk.  Is that correct?    That was a few days later as I have it.  If you go over the page to page 13.  You will see that your first paragraph there 38 talks about the fact that you were asked to write up charges.  Was any disciplinary process ever conducted in relation to Mr van Wyk?    Hm.    And you also - as I understand it – then suggested to Mr Ntshanga that it would be best if the matter was to be handed over to external forensic investigation.  Is that right?    Ms Ngwenya you then at paragraph 39 on page 13 talk about your efforts at the Procurement Department and as I understand your evidence in relation to your endeavours with theProcurement Department you were able to establish that there had been no notification of a tender or other RFP process that was embarked upon prior to the award of the – well – the conclusion of the agreement with Koreneka.  Is that correct?    And if we go over the page to page 14 you will see at paragraph 41 you even went so far as to check whether there was not some sort of deviation from the ordinary tender process that might have been followed in order to legitimise or give some legal underpinning to the contract with Koreneka.  Were you able to find anysuch deviation authorisation?    Yes.    Mr Ngwenya …    Can we go to that document because it might be helpful just to look at it as you …    Refer to it in your evidence?    You will find it as Annexure 5 and it is at page 41 – 4-1.    Now this is – as I understand it – what you were referring to.  It is a letter from SA Express addressed to Valoteck Facilities Management.  Is that as you understand the letter?    And …    The date of the letter?    And what is the heading of the letter?    So can I just pause for a moment.  I take it that labour broking services is something different to ground handling at airport?    Thank you and the first paragraph says   There was no record of the Valoteck/SA Express Contract in the file?    But you have subsequently been shown that.  Is that correct?    But you were not told of any process that was followed in relation to ground handling services prior to the conclusion of the contract with Valoteck.  Is that right?    So is this – is this letter about labour broking services literally all that you could find in relation to Valoteck in the records of the Procurement Department?    Yes.    But all again just to be absolutely clear related to labour broker services?    Thank you and then if we return to your statement at – at least your affidavit – at page 15.  We now come to the point at paragraph 45 because you have now been to Legal Department.  You have been to Finance Department.  You have been to Procurement Department. You have interviewed a number of people – as I have your evidence – and then as I read at paragraph 45 you prepared a Preliminary Investigation Report.  Is that right?   And the report is contained as an annexure to your bundle.  I do not suggest we go there now but you then took steps to present these reports to the GM of the Legal and the CEO.  Is that correct?    And what happened when you provided it to the CEO, Mr Ntshanga?    1 July as I have it …    And we are now on 6 October.    Is that right?    Hm.    Mr Ngwenya I do – I do take it that after – from your affidavit – after you delivered this Preliminary Report to Mr Ntshanga your evidence at page 15 indicates you raised again withhim your Section 34 PRECCA concern and as I understand paragraph 46 on that page he then told you that he wanted you to report to him.  Can you tell us about that?    Hm.    Hm.    And Mr Ngwenya you then – so let us just get right in time.  This in October 2016?   I understand that there was one addition you wanted to make to the affidavit and in your evidence about a further interaction you had with Mr Ntshanga in early 2017 about the report and what concerns he raised with you in relation to the relationship between South African Express and the North West Department of Transport.    For Mr Ntshanga?    And Mr Ngwenya that is at the end of 2016 - as I have it?    November?    And then you have an interaction with him in early 2017.    About the report and he says – as I understand your evidence – he has a concern about the relationship between SA Express and the North West.  Can you tell us about that conversation?    And …    And if I may just remind you Mr Ngwenya your recommendations – you find them at page 50 – 5-0 – which is under Annexure 6 and those recommendations are consistent with the evidence that you have given I suggest but you will let me know if you have a different view.  At page 5-0 …    There is a paragraph number 12.   And you will see there that there are two    You said to Mr Ntshanga as I have your evidence – I can investigate but my scope is limited …    Because of my limited access to people etcetera and so you run that investigation on the terms that we have described.  Is that correct?    Culminates with what you term a Preliminary Report – as I understand your evidence – because your recommendation was somebody else needs to take this further to finalise.    Is that correct?    But just to clarify did – was your sense that they needed to take it further in relation to Mr van Wyk or the greater ambit of the investigation?    Thank you.      Mr Ngwenya if we can go to page 16 of your affidavit.      16 and I’ll pick it up at paragraph 47 but just before we get there, you were going to tell us about the conversation in early 2017 with Mr Ntshanga in relation to his concerns about the relationship between SA Express and the North West Government, canyou tell us about that conversation.      Not at all.      Indeed.      Mr Ngwenya, then at page 16 paragraph 47 you talk about the next two companies in this progression of successive companies who are contracted to provide ground handling services, they are referred to in paragraph 47 as MAMCO and PAMCO, I just for the record like to get those full names…(intervention).      Mr Ngwenya your investigation in relation to the Koreneka agreement, what did you establish in relation to the services that were being provided by Koreneka at Mafikeng and Pilansberg, did you establish that they were providing ground handling.      And did you establish that they continued to provide those at the time when you met with her in June 2016?    And did you establish that despite Valoteck being appointed to replace Koreneka in the Mafikeng airport theyactually had never provided any services there.    Thank you, then if we just move to get to the nub of the Chair’s question as I have it, and we’ll do that in relation to the payments but as I have it there were a series of payments totalling 31million that were received, there – we break them down into four invoices in the course of your evidence but the sum total as I understand your affidavit is that what was reflected on the invoices for each of those payments were not services related to the contract at issue between Koreneka and South African Express, is that a fairsummary?   And were there ever invoices from Koreneka related or making reference to the actual terms of the agreement that had been concluded between Koreneka and South African Express?       Chair my suggestion is that we maybe go now to the Koreneka agreement, just so we can look at some of it’s provisions.    And then we’ll come back to the successive parties.  Let’s do that and Mr Ngwenya it’s effectively through you that we’re going to look at these clauses because I’m notsuggesting and asking you to go through them that either you were involved in concluding the contract nor that you have a legal background at all but it’s useful for us to understand at least what on its terms, the contract envisaged…(intervention).      Oh I do apologise Mr Ngwenya, I do apologise.  Alright we’ll find the first agreement Chair, under tab 7 and commencing at page 52.  Now Mr Ngwenya this agreement that we’re looking at, at page 52, who is this agreement between?    I’m going just for reference purposes to talk about this as the main agreement if I May, it’s the agreement that sets up the relationship as I have it between SA Express and the North West Government in relation to those two airports.  If we then – I’m going to come back to it but just to orientate ourselves, if we then go over to page 91 which is under tab 8 that is another agreement and who is that between?    So can I call this the Koreneka agreement because that’s the one that South African Express then concludes with Koreneka.    And with reference to your evidence earlier that’s why you have tri-partheid or a triangular relationship here.  There’s a relationship between South African Express and the North West Government reflected in the main agreement and then an agreement between South African Express and Koreneka, is that as you understand it?    Thank you, what I’d then like to do is go through just a few provisions Chair of  the main agreement which commences at page 52, I just, so that we get a sense of what this wasenvisaged to cover, and for that purpose I’d like to start at page 59, Chair with respect it’s fairly critical that we do this because the evidence over the next few days is going to have to fit into the structure of these agreements so it’s useful just to go through them.    If we start at page 59 and it’s clause 2.1 there, what this main agreement between the North West Department of Transport and SA Express provides it that at clause 2.1,“in response to the request for proposal for re-introduction  ofa air transport service between OR Tambo InternationalAirport, Cape Town International Airport, Pilansberg andMafikeng Airport, defined as the Airports issued by theDepartment of Community Safety and Transport Management,the airline SA Express responded to  request for proposals forthe supply of airline service subject to a subsidy from theDepartment which request for proposal was duly accepted bythe Department Executive Council”.  There are a number of parts there that we will pick up in later evidence Chair but at least what this agreement is recording is that there was a proposal as I have it, there was a response from SA Express who would provide the airline service and that was subject to a subsidy.  If we then go over the page to page 60 we then at clause 4 get told what those airline services are and at 4.1 it’s recorded that SA Express and the Department hereby agree that SA Express shall, with effect from the effective date commence the airline service on the designated routethat’s been defined as routes between OR Tambo, Cape Town and those two North West Airports, for a period of five years calculated from the effective date and then at 4.3,“as a contribution towards the costs of SA Express in providingthe airline service the Department shall grant to SA Express the subsidy as more fully described in clause 6 hereof and onthe terms and conditions as more fully set out in theagreement”,So I’d like to suggest we next go to that clause 6, it’s over the page at page 61 and under clause 6.1 is an important clause because it reflects is that the Department shall pay to SA Express the subsidy and the management company the operational costs of both airports, annually in advance as stipulated in annex A.  Now we need to just look at a few clauses to unpack that.  First of all this is the first time we’ve heard about a management company in the course of this agreement,so we need to go to clause 15 which is on page 73 to find out who the management company or what the management company is as envisaged in the agreement.  So if we go to clause 15 on page 73, 15.1 provides,“The Department mandates SA Express to appoint amanagement company responsible for managing the operationsat Pilansberg and Mafikeng Airports”,At 15.4 – well let’s go 15.2 first,“The Department shall be liable for the payment of operationalcosts of the operations of the said management company,15.3, the management company will be responsible for operational and other additional services as required andagreed with the Department and airline and 15.4, SA Expressshall enter into a service level agreement with themanagement company in terms of which the performance of the management company will be monitored and evaluated and15.5 for the purposes of development and skills transfer, a)SAExpress shall train the employees of the management companyand b) to be able to perform the functions of the service levelagreement referred to in the clause above”. So Chair at this point in the structure of the agreement, just to summarise is as I read the clauses we’ve got the Department agreeing to pay SA Express a subsidy for flying the routes and also to pay a management company that’s going to be appointed by SA Express in relation to the operations at the airport and there were also to be, overthe page at 62 – sorry I’ve gone back to 61 so at 62 clause 7, I won’t read the whole of the clause but that’s a clause about quarterly reports that had to be provided by SA Express to update it and significantly Chair, we should go to Annexure A and that is at page 88 because Chair that is the subsidy structure that we had a reference to earlier in the subsidy clause.  I see that this copy of that page is not all that good, I know that there’s a better one in the file of Mr Phiri who’s coming tomorrow but I’m fairly familiar with these figures so I’ll do my best just to indicate…(intervention).    Indeed we’ll do that then it’s in the file, I’ll make a note about that but the upshot is that in terms of this subsidy structure, Chair as this – we understand this table you’ll see a reference in the top line under the heading, North West Concession, that there’s a Pilansberg entry and then a few lines down a Mafikeng entry and then two or so lines down from that you have total subsidy, that half of this table is what the North West Government was going to be paying to SA Express.  The second half of the table you’ll see on the left-hand side in the first column, there’s a heading, Management Company Subsidy, and so the amounts in the second half are the management company subsidies.  These amounts, Chair, are in the millions so what you see in the first year, if we move along the columns is in year one, the total subsidy that’s going to be paid to SA Express in the first half is 58million and a bit and the amount that’s going to bepaid to the management company is 51million, if you go down.  In year two the subsidy to SA Express is 51milllion and a bit, I’m just rounding off for the purposes of this discussion and in year two to the management company is going to be 31million paid.  In year three, 43million to SA Express and 31million to the management company.  In year four 46million to SA Express and 31million to the management company and in year five, 38million to SA Express and another 31million to the management company.  As I’ve totalled that up it just exceeds about 400million over the course of five years in relation to flying routes on SA Express’ part and then on the managementcompany’s part, doing some ground handling.  So that’s the arrangement of the main agreement.  If we then go over to the Koreneka agreement, Chair what appears quite striking about this agreement is that it has a totally different structure for how Koreneka is going to deliver its services of ground handling and how it’s going to be remunerated and so I’d just like to highlight those two clauses.  It talks in it’s introductory parts about the fact that it’s a ground handling agreement, that Koreneka is contracted to provide those services at Pilansberg and Mafikeng and then if we go to page 99 you’ll see in clause 20, it says at 20.1,“In consideration of the ground handling company providing the services, the carrier, which is a reference to SA Expressagrees to pay the handling company the charges set out in therelevant Annex B hereto including any additional expenditureincurred for providing the services referred to in thisagreement and the charges set out in Annex B hereto are notinclusive of any of the following”,And that is just an exclusion about charges that would be levied really by airport and customs and other authorities but then the next important clause is clause 21, because this is talking about, well how are they going to account, how is the handling company, Koreneka going to account to SA Express and to summarise there’s an invoicing system.  Monthly there will be invoices and within 30 days there’ll be payment and the last important thing to go to then is Annex B, which commences at page 108.1, that lists all of the multitude of handlingservices that are going to have to be provided and finally at page 108.5 are all of the rates that are applicable to the provision of those …(intervention).  108.5 Chair.    And Chair, you’ll see under clause 1.2 there, there’s a heading for the services set out above the applicable rate shall be as follows.  And then there are rates for ground-handling turnaround cost, for ground-handling labour, there’s a sub total, there’s a bit of a management fee put in there.  And there’s a total of R 116 443.  If you then go down to the breakdown in relation to the management fees in the next paragraph so now we’re talking about management fees in particular.  There is an annual total that can be accumulated for management fees, that’s about the fourth columnalong.  And what you’ll see there Chair is that management fees in relation to the turnaround of aircraft, the total annual amount is approximately R 425 000 and the total for the other services which are customer service agents and general workers is R 846 000.  Chair, what is striking we will suggest in the course of the evidence is the discrepancy between those figures.  You’ve got figures in relation to subsidy under the main agreement in the region of 400 000 million and a portion of that just under 200 million that over the five years is envisaged to go to the management company.  But then in the actual agreement that’s concluded between Koreneka and SA Express, you’vegot much more modest rates.    It’s very strange.    Indeed.  That will be explored with the witnesses Chair.  But that at least gives us the framework for the agreement that was concluded, a main agreement but a reference in it to the management company and an entitlement to those millions worth of subsidies and then the agreement between SA Express and Koreneka.  Mr Ngwenya, as I have your evidence though, the sort of invoicing that the Koreneka agreement envisages monthly in these much more modest amounts are not invoices you ever uncovered, is that correct?    So if we may then move to the invoices thatyou did uncover because they are in the millions and there are four of them.  And Chair, with your guidance I’m not going to go to (inaudible) collectively, let’s conclude if it’s convenient the Koreneka position.    So we will do that picking it up at page 18, Mr Ngwenya of you affidavit 18.    Indeed, I’ve got a note here.    Chair, I will not make another mistake.  I mighteven attach it to the microphone so there’s no chance.  But we are at page 18, Mr Ngwenya and paragraph 53 there you start to tell us about the first payment.  Mr Ngwenya, you give us it seems to be the style of your affidavit, an enormous amount of details.  My sense is that Mr Ngwenya, you’re a very detailed person and so you have set out in scrupulous detail the tracking of the invoice and then who authorised it and then how it was paid and when it was paid.  We have that on record, I’d like to just to highlight the important points of it.  Paragraph 53.1 records that on the 4 t h of May 2015 Koreneka issued an invoice of 8.5 million to SA Express and then will you tell us what description was used on that invoice?    Now if you jump down to paragraph 53.4 on that page you make the point that the expense authorisation whichfollows that invoice reflects the same description, Airport refurbishments and compliance maintenance and operation setup cost.  And then will you just tell us what you make of that description on the invoice?    Mr Ngwenya, I do need to indicate this to you in terms of the evidence that will come in due course.  It is not clear certainly to me that that description even falls within the envisage subsidies under the main agreement.  On what basis do you say you are satisfied that it falls under the main agreement?    Mm.    Mm.    Yes.    Indeed.    And Mr Ngwenya, if I may suggest yourpersonal knowledge in relation to the agreement between SA Express and Koreneka and what you managed to uncover in the invoicing etcetera is particularly relevant for our purposes.  We have also listened to some of those recordings and indeed we will play them in the course of the evidence.  Mr van Wyk is often on those recordings indicating the need for refurbishment and fire trucks but Mr Ngwenya, that’s precisely part of our investigation because it is not at all clear to us that those were in fact envisaged services under the main agreement at all.  Right.  So the first payment is 8.5 million, we’re at page 18.  And they are for this quoted airport refurbishment and compliance maintenance and operational setup costs.  That 8.5 million is paid by SA Express to Koreneka, is that correct?    You have the date of that over the page at 19, it was paid on the 6 t h of May, correct?   And what you can certainly say is that description of services is not covered by the SA Express Koreneka agreement, correct?    The second payment you’ll pick up at page 19.  It was to the value of a further 8.5 million and it was dated the 17 t h of August at least the invoice was.  Do you see that at 54.1?    What description was given on that invoice?   And I then expect your evidence will be the same that that was not covered by the SA Express Koreneka agreement?    And none the less at 54.4 I pick up that the payment was made on the 27 t h of August, correct?    In the amount of 8.5 million?    And generally you gave us evidence earlier but there is authorisation for these payments being provided until this point by Mr van Wyk, is that correct?    Right.  And then we go to the third payment.  Chair, what’s interesting about the third payment from Mr Ngwenya’s evidence is that the payment was for 14 million and it was a single payment on a single day.  But the way it came into SA Express was in the form of two invoices for less each than 10 million.  And Mr Ngwenya has some views about why it was broken up into two invoices but none the less paid in one payment.  Mr Ngwenya, you’ll find that at page 20 paragraphs 55.  What is the point- well let’s go first, the description on the first invoice which was for 5.84 million, what was that?    And the second invoice, what description was given for it?    And that was for an amount of 8.16 million, is that correct?    And then at 55.2 you make the point about the payments falling under 10 million rand, what is that point?    Chair, just to pick up that point.  If we just look at one of the expense authorisations you’ll see those signatures.  We can go to the one under tab 13 page 123.      Chair, you’ll see in the right-hand half of the page at the bottom there’s a place for recommended by and a signature and a name to be printed and then approved by.  Mr Ngwenya, who’s signature is on the approved by line there?    And then the name beneath that reads BT van Wyk, is that right?    And then is that signature under additionalsignature below there the one that you identify as Mr Ntshanga’s?    Thank you.  And that’s repeated throughout in relation to the expense authorisations, is that right?    So those complete the four invoices but three payments.  The first of 8.5, the second of 8.5, the third of 14 which total 31 million, is that right?    And you were satisfied after your investigationthat none of the descriptions on the invoices related to matters covered by the SA Express Koreneka agreement, correct?    And if we go back to page 20 of the affidavit ... (intervenes)    At page 20 of the affidavit Mr Ngwenya, youtalk about a discussion with Ms Tlatsana that you reference at paragraph 55.3 and you state there that in my discussion with Ms Tlatsana she said that she did not know about these invoices and payments.  Is that correct, did you ask her about them?    Thank you.  And then you ... (intervenes)    Was your understanding from her that that was the role that Mr Kalisilira played.    Is that what she conveyed to you?    Mr Ngwenya, you made the point a moment agothat you went to Mr Ntshanga to ask him about why SA Express was paying Koreneka in relation to matters as you understood it covered by the main agreement, is that right?    And what was Mr Ntshanga’s response to that?    Because when we looked at that main agreement you’ll recall that clause says the department shall pay SAExpress the subsidy and the Management Company.  Is that where you draw the conclusion that it was for the department to pay the appointed Management Company which in this case is Koreneka?    So you raise it with Mr Ntshanga as I have your evidence and he says, yes it was erroneously paid to SA Express and so SA Express had to pay it out to Koreneka, is that right?    Thank you.    I was just going to direct you to one aspect Chair.    Excellent.  Chair, it was just to reassure you at page 21 of Mr Ngwenya’s affidavit that he had exactly the samequestion as you had.  As his paragraph 57 of the affidavit reads, he’s recounted in the precious paragraph what Mr Ntshanga’s response was and he says in his affidavit if I may Mr Ngwenya, I was disturbed by that response.  The lingering question was why didn’t SA Express refund the money to the Department if it was paid by mistake but instead pay it to Koreneka.  So Mr Ngwenya, it’s fair to say to was precisely your concern, was it not?    Indeed.  Thank you Chair, we can continue after the break.   Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Ngwenya I would like to pick it up at the point where Valoteck is now contracted to SA Express to replace Koreneka in relation to the Mafikeng Airport.  You have given us the background already to that in your testimony.  As I have it in the course of your investigation you tried to understand on what basis Valoteck had been appointed.  Is that correct and Mr Ngwenya if you will turn on the microphone?  Thank you.    Mr Ngwenya as I have your evidence Valoteck is appointed but the only record you could find of any process that was embarked upon before the contract was concluded related to labour broking services.  Is that correct?    Chair I propose we just look at and Mr Ngwenya the Valoteck Agreement and then we can be quite swift with the PAMCO and MAMCO Agreements thereafter because the point to be made is that they are replicas of the Koreneka Agreement.  Youwill find the Valoteck Agreement under Tab 19 at page 1-3-7.    So what you see here Mr Ngwenya is an agreement.  Just tell us who the parties are if you may?    And Chair I do not propose to spend time on it but you can rest assured and if anyone wants to take us up on this they will.  It is a replica.  The only – there are one or two oddities.  The annexure referred to in this agreement we have not been able tosource. The one that sets out the ground handling services.  This is the only version of the agreement that the commission has able – has been able to find and then if you go over to Tab 20 …    Hm.    Indeed.    Indeed.    So you get the first Koreneka Agreement which is then replicated effectively in the Valoteck Agreement and then you will see if you turn over to the next tab at page 1-5-9.  Mr Ngwenya who are the parties to this agreement?   Thank you.  What I am interested in – sorry – and let us just go to MAMCO to close it off and then I want to ask you about when these two agreements were concluded.  You will find the MAMCO Agreement as over the next tab at 21 starting at page 1-8-7 and who are the parties there?    Thank you.  Now these two agreementsMr Ngwenya when were they concluded?    Oh my goodness.  It has happened again.    Because I was not looking at my notes at the time.    He must and if I do it again please correct me.  Mr Ngwenya …    Indeed there is …    Mr Ngwenya please tell the Chair when these two agreements - and Chair we refer to them for short the Mafikeng Airport Management Company is MAMCO.  The Halcogen Trading asPilanesberg Airport Management Company we refer to as PAMCO and I suggest those will be our abbreviations for the next …    Evidence session.    When were these two agreements concluded Mr Ngwenya?    And …    Right.  So let us just place ourselves in time if we may.  You get the call from Ms Tlatsana on 24 June 2016.  Correct?    You move to investigate.  You have your meeting on the Monday thereafter.  You produce your report on 6 October 2016.  Is that correct?    You do not see action on it but you give a final report later in that year not signed subject to the caveats that you have described.  Then you have an interaction with Mr Ntshanga in early 17 – as I recall it – where he is asking you to write a letter to the North West Government to reassure them about the relationship …   And then when does he leave SA Express?    When was …?    And was it at the end of the month?    And these two agreements – as I have your evidence – are signed by Mr Ntshanga within two or so days of that departure?    They dated the 28 t h and 29 March 2017.  Is that correct?    Thank you.  Mr Ngwenya I then …    Koreneka.    So there is a period of time Mr Ngwenya – as I have it – where there were three members of the CC herself, Mr Thabeng and Ms Phiri?    But then Mr Thabeng resigned and then Ms Phiri there was litigation over her removal.  Is that correct?    And can I just ask about whether your investigation established any relationships between Ms Phiri whom you referred to and who was appointed into the company Koreneka, Mr Phiri who was responsible for certain appointments within the company andMr van Wyk?    And what are they?    But there is a personal relationship?    Thank you.   And …    Indeed.    We – we have – I think on your evidence already Mr Ngwenya that Ms Dube moves from Koreneka where she was appointed as the Facilities Manager by the Mr Phiri we have been speaking about.  Correct?    She is then dismissed by Ms Tlatsana.  Correct?   That Ms Tlatsana relays to you is the reason for the conflict emerging between her and Mr van Wyk.  Correct?    And then Valoteck is given the Agreement.  The same agreement that was concluded with Koreneka and does Ms Dube feature there again?    So there is another personal link as I have itwithin Valoteck’s ownership.  Ms Dube appointed initially in Koreneka by Mr Phiri and then appears again in Valoteck.  Correct?    And then her co-partner in that business Ms Mogodiri is related to Mr Phiri and Ms Phiri.  Is that correct?    That just for the record is at page 22 paragraph 59 of your affidavit and in terms of the ownership of PAMCO and MAMCO were you able to establish any links there Mr Ngwenya?    And let me just get one other point of clarity.  Valoteck was never paid by SA Express.  Was it?    It was paid directly by the North West Department of Transport.  Is that correct?    And do you know what the payment position is in relation to MAMCO and PAMCO?    We will traverse that in other evidence.  SoMr Ngwenya if we may then go - subject to any other queries Chair that you may have in relation to the agreements – I would like to take us to page 25 of your affidavit …    And before we begin with the last paragraph on that page I would just like your confirmation.  You – you indicated a moment ago you did not investigate PAMCO and MAMCO extensively …    But I do recall from your affidavit that you were able to establish that no procurement process had been followed inrelation to their appointment at the end of March 2017.  Is that correct?    Okay and that is as SA Express’ procurement is concerned.  Correct?    We now have a section of your affidavit Mr Ngwenya that is headed “The Lithuli House Ambush and the R3 million Bribe”.  Mr Ngwenya I would like to go through that.  Can you tell us what happened on or about 18 August 2016?  I know that in the course of the remaining pages of your affidavit you go into a great deal of detail about the steps you took to identify the people who you were dealing with.  Feel free to – to explore that but in essence tell us what happened on 18 August 2017 – 2016.    Apologies.   Mr Ngwenya …    If I may just interject there.  At page 26 paragraph 73 you record in your affidavit that you said something else to this caller when he said to you that he had been given a mandate from Lithuli House.    To come and speak to you.  What you record    “…and cannot be talking about LithuliHouse mandates.” Is that correct?    Thank you.  Please continue.  So you said that.  You then had a discussion with him about where you could meet - as I have your testimony …    And he said he is going to get onto a plane and come into Johannesburg and so you could meet at the airport.   Is that correct?    And – and then if we – on page 27 …    You – you then pick up that point about the – the indication that he gave you that he was going to be flying up from    But nonetheless …    He was calling you from the terminal building.  Correct?    Hm.    But …    You then did agree to meet him in the Intercontinental Hotel foyer.  Is that right?    And then as I have your affidavit you – you went to meet him.  On your way however you told Ms Mshwele that you were going to meet a person who had called you.  Is that correct?    And then tell us what happened when you went to the Intercontinental?    Mr Ngwenya …    Can I just clarify?  You – you indicated in your testimony a moment ago that he was referring to the money siphoned out of the North West.    Is that right?  Is that the word he used?    Is that the word he used?    And – and what …    And then he went on to say was to be used to fund the ANC’s political campaign.    Thank you.      But Mr Ngwenya did you have any doubt in the course of this conversation that you were talking about that R31million?      And then you ...(intervention)       Mr Ngwenya could I just stop you there if I may, because it’s a part that comes up in the recordings but it’s not an aspect that you traverse in your evidence yet, so could we just get it clear you have by this stage, you’re in August 2016.      You have been able to account for the R31million.      Because you have gone back to the records of S A Express and you’ve seen that total amount being paid out of S AExpress pursuant to four invoices and three payments, is that correct?      But Chair you will recall and we were looking at that subsidy page under the main agreement, the first total annual amount that Koreneka was supposed to receive or the management company to be appointed was a total of R51million, so at this point you’ve accounted for R31million of it which was paid out of S A Express but there’s a remaining R20million.      But as I understand the recordings and what Ms Tlatsana told you that R20million came then in a payment directly from the Northwest to Koreneka correct?      And as I recall that recording which we willlisten to that occurred in the Spur Restaurant part of the conversation between Ms Tlatsana and Mr and Mr van Wyk is about R20million.      Which Ms Tlatsana was not giving Mr van Wyk access to, is that correct?      So Chair that’s important background because now we move to a point in this conversation as I have it with this person you’ve been called to meet with where he moves from offering you R3million to drop the investigation to this R20million.     And what does he say about that?    Mr Ngwenya you are now as I have your evidence at page 29 of your affidavit, I have been following what was contained there as you’ve been giving your testimony where I would like to ask you to pick it up and really in conclusion of your evidence is paragraph 80, because at paragraph 80 you talk about the steps you took in the following week and what the reactions were of Ms Mochoele and Mr Ntshanga to what you told them, can you take us through that please.    Chair those are the questions from our side.    Thank you Chair.    We are done, I understand we have an early start tomorrow. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair.     Not a problem Chair.    Correct Chair.    Yes certainly.  Chair yesterday I testified that when Ms Fikelepi was doing the process in terms of engaging on the agreement he sent on the 6 t h we deal with it yesterday on the email where she wanted FSP…    6 June.   6 July.    Yes.  She sent an email where she wanted BNP to confirm that the FSP licence is in order and we need a copy and also a confirmation that it is in good standing.  You recall Chair that yesterday we saw FSP a copy that was certified dated 23 June.  When we received queries specifically the letter that came from Webber Wentzel on the 13 t h what we distributed today Chair is the letter that wewrote to BNP.  Allow me to read it because you just circulated today Chiar.    The letter is dated 13 July 2016 attention to    Yes Chair I can confirm that we did not receive any communication or any confirmation as we have requested in the letter that they must give us that proof they must even tell us who did they send the communication to.  So we never received itChair.    Yes, yes Chair.    Yes.    I do not know Chair.  I really do not know.  I will really be speculating at this point in time.    Okay.    Yes.    Agree.    Yes Chair I would.  I think the email that you referring to is it the one dated the 8 June?   Yes.    And acting CEO yes.    Agree.    Yes Chair.    Yes I will be comfortable Chair.    No I do not know Chair.    I do not recall any conflict of interest that Ms Meyene declared in the meetings.    Yes.    It is Chair.  It is a correct reflection especially knowing what I know now and after the testimony of Mr Van Der Merwe especially having said that he never claimed any cancellation fee from them yet the letters that we have been receiving from BNP as well there was one that was even saying that the 5 million US dollars is the – is the money that they will filter it down to SAA because it is claimed by Grissag AG PTY LTD.    Correct Chair.    I accept that Chair with all the means that I tried to do behind the scenes to make sure that it does not get approved.  But if it did go ahead it was going to cost the company R50 million.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.  On different occasions as I have highlighted yesterday that earlier in – after I joined SAA she said she does not write anything down.  I would receive calls Chair a minimum of three a day from the chairperson of the board. One thing that was consistent in her messages is the pace that I am moving it is as if it is business as usual and it is not business as usual we need to move we are delaying things, why are we taking unnecessary documents to the board, why am I – the board has given us approval to go ahead with the transaction yet I want to keep on sending back the documents to theboard. So all the time the pressure was more on what are you waiting for approve.  Certain things are under your delegation and acting CO’s are delegation so we must approve. Specifically on the cancellation fee Chair especially when I send the term sheet and I included the non-binding that is where the pressure was then mounting to say she even also said I was appointed and they thought I would be in the team that is turning around the company it looks like I do not appreciate the pressure that they are in as the board in terms of getting the funding.  My pace is very slow.  I treat the business as if it is business as usual.  There is no need for me to be – to be including certain clauses that donot have anything to do with the funders.  So one pressure was take out the non-binding because the funders now have got the perception that SAA does not need money.  So the pressure where along those lines Chair also allow me perhaps because it is one of my evidence where she will request certain things Chair. For an example there was an event where she said to me she thought I was coming from rural areas which I agreed because I am Chair coming from rural areas. She said but under my leadership SAA Procurement spend is still 2% of the 24 billion.  So I then endeavoured to get the information for her to say Chair if you look at the total expenditure of SAA which at the time was 24 billion at the biggest 60% of that expenditure Chair was made up of jet fuel, of salaries, of lease rentals because SAA only owned 9 aircrafts but had a fleet of 66 so the rest is lease rentals where you pay in dollars.  The other one was the maintenance reserves. So I then said as much as you can give the black players the job but if you do not playinto this big five of the big ticket items it will not really make a mark and I do not believe that there is a black player for example I did say we have not tested the market but who will buy the aircraft for an example?  She then following meeting she gave me for an example two names of the – of the companies and then she said now that you said black people do not have money to buy aircrafts do you think black people do not have money to even insure the aircrafts?  I said I can look into that Chair because insuring of the aircrafts also – is linked with the lease rentals because normally there is a clause on the lease rentals that will dictate who can insure the aircraft.  And then myselfand my team the fleet committee looked at the – we then looked at the different aircraft types with the insurance clauses and more – all of them Chair were saying the aircraft should be insured by an internationally recognised insurance company and that is the clause that is dictated by the lessors themselves because they own the aircraft. So I went back to her to say Chair I will not be able to do – to check and to include the local insurers because they will be in breach of the contractual agreement. She then said she saw it in my eye – in my eyes that I will not do it.  So I asked, what do you mean Chair and then she said she related a story to say she does have a child who is a chartered accountant. She does not say a lot like I do but she sees it in the eye if she is not going to do something.  So she said she saw that in my eyes when she was giving me an instruction that I am not going to do it.  So those were the type of pressures that I was getting Chair. Some of the examples I have included them in my statement.   Yes Chair.    I would agree and say yes and no Chair.  More because one thing we were working together in terms of all of us knew that there are loans that are maturing but the pressure that she was more putting was she wanted us not to take the things to the board and that was the board transaction.  So all the decisions needed to be taken by the board so she was then putting pressure that there is no need we are bombarding the board with unnecessary approvals.  So she did not want us to take documents to the board Chair.  I am in agreement with the loans that were about to mature and I had appreciation of that as well.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair I am saying certain pressure was based on the performance because loans were maturing.    But the pressure that says do not take things to the board yet this is a board transaction.  So basically I needed – it was beyond my mandate and beyond acting CEO’s mandate Chair that decisions and the responsibility and the accountability needed to be taken by the board because in terms of DOA this is the board transaction so now she – in her way she was asking us to do illegal things that I feel if you do them she will again come back to you and say you did things that were illegal.    I would say Chair she will be – being not truthful especially that the recent delegation of authority was approved after I joined SAA so it was very fresh to everyone’s mind in terms of how much is the authority for CEO, for CFO how much is the delegation – things that you need to take to the board.  So it was not an old document.  It is on the pack – it was approved when I was there Chair – yes.    Yes Chair.    Please come again?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair I would assume that she knew that.    I do not recall it having discussed but havingappreciated the fact that she has been the chair of the board of SAA for quite some time and before becoming the chair of the board she was the board member of SAA I would reasonably assume that she knew.    Agree.    Yes Chair I agree.    Chair this proposal – I mean – the Instruction 3 from National Treasury as you rightfully say it was effective April 20 – May 2016.    1 May.  It – it talks about anything above 15percent has to be taken to National Treasury prior.  It was not - Chair this was not implemented at SAA.    I am not aware Chair if it was known at the time.  Also I think I became aware of it later in the year.  I am not sure if we received at the – at the same date Chair.    I am not – I am – I do not know Chair and all the communications they come via in terms of the protocol via the Chairperson of the Board.  So I am – I am not aware.  I am not sure when she received this from National Treasury.    Yes Chair.    Based on this yes Chair.    Come again.    Yes I was aware.    Yes I do.    I considered that Chair but I was still going to take those steps and it is one of the instances where I would say it was overtaken by events.  Whilst you – you suspect that on this – on this cancellation fee there – there are foul plays and all that you then received – we received communication from – from Webber Wentzel and we have – we communicated with – with BNP. So there were lots of things happening Chair.  One thing thatkept me – kept my focus was to ensure that if BNP does not have the – the FSB Licence as it was a critical criteria my main concern was to safeguard the assets of the company.  I needed to ensure that I cancel the transaction with BNP. So whilst I was aware of the combat and prevention of corrupt activities Chair I was - I was more focusing on protecting the assets of the company because I wanted to cancel with the pressure as well because during the time that we gave BNP on 13 July and the 20 t h the calls kept on coming from the Chairperson of the Board saying we should not cancel with BNP because BNP will sue us.So in my engagements with her I used to ask what would be their basis to sue us and she would say no we need to give them the cancellation fee.  We need to approve things.  We promised them that they must go source funds for us.  The funders are out there getting money for us and now we are cancelling. So I then said no Chair but the critical criteria where other companies were disqualified was the FSB Licence.  So yes Chair as much as the combat and the prevention of corrupt activities I knew about it.  It was on – not on the top of my agenda.  My focus was to ensure that I cancelled the transaction with BNP should they not have the FSB Licence especially after starting to suspect as well that BNP as well looks like he is misrepresenting to us because on 6 July they gave us a copy of the FSB Licence and now they are not responding to us. So I agree but the focus to protect the assets of the company Chair.   I accept Chair but as I have highlighted that I was looking at the bigger picture in terms of – of – because at the end nothing happened.  I safeguard the assets of the company.  The company was not in any financial prejudice.  I think that is what I was in – interested in or focusing on.    We – we discussed this Chair yesterday that I acted in the best interest of the company by – because of the pressure I recommended it but I did work behind the scenes in terms of talking to the other Board Members to ensure that the – the transaction or the approval does not go through. So I acted with the information and the pressure that I had at the time.  I believe that to the best of my ability I acted in the best interest of the company to save it.    Thank you Chair.  Whilst I – whilst I appreciate the fact that I did not put the – that I am not recommending I think I also came to the Commission more to – to – for the South Africans to understand the pressure that was mounting on us.  Theenvironment that we were working under and I also stipulated yesterday that whilst we were under pressure I did not act negligently by just accepting what the Chair is saying and do it. I did under the circumstances and also if – if the Commission can appreciate the pressure Chair that we are under and at some point I was even scared.  I understand the – the fact that the recommendation is saying approve but I would also appreciate if this Commission can also appreciate the steps that I did in terms of communicating with the Board Members and ensuring that eventually the transaction does not go through. Some of the things are difficult Chair but I really want to paint a picture to say we were really under a lot of pressure.  If it was according to me I would not have even taken the – the submission to the Board but we were working under pressure to a point where I even said it yesterday that there was a point I would be scared Chair.   Chair when I joined – perhaps let me start by saying when I joined SAA I was very excited to be part of the team that will turn around the company.  I believed that I do have the skill and the competency to – to work at SAA but when I was on the ground I realised that the work is doable but there are these political things where these undue pressures that are coming especially from the Board.So when I joined SAA I would hear certain things.  For example there would be – there were certain people who were suspended because they were – sometimes they were saying no to the decision or the instructions from the Chair.  So I – I decided that I will stand my ground but as the pressure was mounting – as I said yesterday I even one day told my husband that I do not know what I got myself into when I joined SAA. Maybe I joined SAA at the wrong time because the pressures are coming left, right and centre Chair where you are given this instruction to do this.  You are given an instruction to do this and certain things are not lawful.  For example you will just be given a CV to say appoint this person in the procurement space and when the processes are done for example if I can give you that example. When – Chair one of the days told me that there is a guy who – who struggles and does not have a job and this person when she was– when this person was praying he saw a vision from God that the person who will assist you in your problems is – is Ms Myeni.  So I said oh wow Chair and then she then said procurement area is in shambles.  Appoint this – appoint this person in procurement. At the end of that discussion that I had Chair with the – with the Chairperson of the Board I had a missed call – I had a message and also a CV from this person.  So whilst we were discussing with the Chairperson I then assumed that she gave me his details.  So through the – the process - the recruitment process when I spoke to the Acting Chief Procurement Officer because it was his area.He knew about it because he did not ask me questions.  So it means Chair spoke to him as well.  So the interviews were set Chair because there as a – a vacant – there were vacancies in the procurement space.  The – the person who came in on the interviews he failed dismally.  I did not attend Chair the interviews but I was told by the – Mr Lester Peters that he failed dismally. When I called the Chairperson to give an update that Chair unfortunately this person failed dismally.  Chair summoned me to take the – I told him in the afternoon.  He summoned me to go to Durban and take a first flight the following day.    Yes Chair.    I did so Chair.  I took a first flight thefollowing day.    We met at Sibaya.    Yes in Durban.  A first question that she asked me was how a person with LLB can fail an interview.  I was still casual about it Chair then and then I said no – no Chairperson even a chartered accountant fails an interview and then she said does this mean you are not going to take instructions or implement instructions from the Board.Again casually I said Chair did this have a Board Resolution and then I could see from – from her face Chair that I think my answer is wrong and then I then changed to say – because now I was not feeling comfortable and I am not in Johannesburg and I – I do not know Chair. I just felt uncomfortable and then I then said no perhaps Chair I need to go back and we are going to look in the procurement area with a team.  Maybe there are other vacancies there that are lower than what we interviewed the guy for.  Maybe this position was very high for – for him and then he asked me are you going to do that and then I said yes Chair I will do it and then – that is how I got out of it Chair and I never implemented that.    The – the – there were three items Chair.    There was a decision that was taken by the Board. I am not sure whether it was coming from National Treasury …    To vet all top 100.    No this is …    Yes.  This is …    Yes Chair this is another example.  This is one of the topics that we discussed on that day.    The vetting process by Security State Agency was – was in – in progress at SAA.  She told me that there were - some candidates have been vetted already.  Some have not but in my Finance Department there is one person who has failed the vetting and I cannot have a – a person who has failed the vetting in the finance area because it is sensitive.    In mine.    She said in finance …    And - and finance was - was headed by me Chair.    So she – I then said okay what are the results and then she did not give me the results but she said the person who failed the – the vetting in your area is – is Ms Lindsay Olitzki.  So I suggest that you go back.  Tomorrow have a meeting with Lindsay and – offline meeting – and you must give Lindsaytwo options. Either she must check where else can you place her in the – in the organisation or you must fire her.  I then raised concerns Chair because it will trigger the – the labour disputes especially if it was not part of – of an employee’s contract.  So I also took that and I came back. I discussed that with the Acting CEO and raised my concerns to say we need to have a – a uniform of doing – of dealing with the results that are coming from SSA and this is what the Chair has said I must do on my side.  So Acting CEO as well agreed with me to say let us wait until the entire process is concluded and we will discuss it with Exco and come up with a policy on how to do the – on how to handle the ones that have passed and the ones that have failed the vetting. That day Chair I got a call from Chair in the afternoon asking if I spoke to Lindsay and I said no I did not talk to Lindsay but I spoketo the Acting CE because – and I – I then explained what we discussed and what we agreed and then she was furious to say she gives me instructions and I do not follow instructions. Instead I go and discuss with Acting CEO.  If – if she wanted to discuss with Acting CEO she should have done so.  I said but Chair he is also my direct report and we are also protecting the company from the labour disputes and - and all that.  I then even suggested to her to say maybe she needs to talk to the Acting CEO and then we formulate a – a view on how to treat these and also perhaps check with the Legal Department and ensure that the company would be protected from thelabour disputes Chair.    Ja.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    I think it occurred between June – I stand to be corrected.  I can – I can check.  I think from June 2016 but I can – Ican – I do not know the exact – but it was in 2016.    The – the meeting that we had was all the top 100 Executives will be vetted.  I heard from – from the passages that some did not submit the information and some did.  I am one of the people who submitted the information.    I regarded it as strange Chair because thatis the – in my understanding that is the process that you do when especially the top secret security clearance …    Because the – the SS - SSA was doing the top secret security clearance.  So it is strange because my understanding is at Executives we are a different levels and we will be exposed to different confidential information.  So we would not – you would not take the entire 100 …    And vet for top secret security.  Some will be vetted for the – the clearances that are lower than that.  So it was strange.    I did not believe so but I did because I wasinstructed to do it.    Correct Chair.    Yes Chair.  When – when she gave me this instruction it was when I was suspecting that there – there are things that Ms Myeni is doing because first she asked me to appoint somebody in the procurement area and – and I assumed that she wanted somebody to be her eyes and ears in the procurement space.  Maybe now she wanted – she had somebody in mind that she wanted to put on – on Ms Olitzki’s position.    No I never raised it Chair.    Yes Chair I …    Chair I was scared.  When I was in Durban I was – I was scared.  I will put it bluntly Chair.  I was scared of my life and I am not saying Chair …    Was going to do anything …    Something came to my mind that I need to be careful.  I was scared of my life.  I was never scared of – of losing my job Chair because …   I believed that I work hard.  I am dedicated.  My work ethics talk for itself.  I can get another job.    Yes, yes Chair.  It was clear to me that I was going to eventually lose especially after the cancellation of the – of the BNP.  It was clear that I was going to lose it because some of the instructions that Chair would give me would say you are not performing because you do not have KPIs.   Yes Chair.  What I am – what I am trying to paint is I was doing my work to the best of my ability and with dedication and – and all that.  It was never in my forefront that I should please certain people because I need to protect my job.  To clarify on – on the one for – for - especially after the transaction of BNP. I knew after we cancelled the – the BNP Contract that Chair might do what Ms Kwinana told me earlier because Ms Kwinana used to relate that you – you have got a shelf life - that is what she used to say – you have got a shelf life with – with Ms Myeni.  If you do not do certain instructions and then she related instances where she will go toSunnyside Café and disguise herself and write whistleblowing emails.    Ms Myeni.    Ms Myeni used to go to – this is the – what was related by Ms Kwinana and it was also in the article in 2017 in the Mail & Guardian where Ms Kwinana stated this to say Ms Myeni if you are not – if she wants to get rid of you she - she sometimes goes – even goes to the extent of going to the Sunnyside Café and disguiseherself and write whistleblowing emails and then from there because the custodian of – of whistle blower at SAA was the Chief Internal Audit she would come and then put pressure on the Chief Internal Audit to either suspend you or to dismiss you or appoint – there - there is some – some firms to do the work.    In – in Durban I was scared of my life.    Something like that Chair.    Hm.    Chair I was – on all the occasions – let me say I was scared of my life Chair …    And – and with all these pressures and also with Mr Mngadi and everyone – pressure coming from everywhere I was scared of my life.    Come again Chair.   Yes Chair I – I did.  Those came across my mind.  Also Chair one thing that I had in mind in terms of – of dealing with Chair of the Board.  When I joined SAA I heard a story where my – my predecessor - in fact I think Ms Stimpel’s testimony said so that there was a point where Mr Wolf had a pen and – and then he recorded Ms Myeni. So you think those things that to the extent of people thinking of even recording you.  So what – the kind of person you are that people now are trying to build evidence and even recording you and all that.  I was scared Chair that I could be harmed.    No Chair.    Yes.    Yes I do Chair.       Yes Chair, I do.       I consulted before I take the decision, consulted with HR and also the legal department and the procurement, before the decision was taken we assessed the seriousness of taking the confidential documents that belonged to procurement.       I made concerns?       I do.       I recall it.       Yes I do.      I said I never asked for them but I assumed that those would be given to me.       Chair that is what I was told at SAA that those documents, nobody except the procurement can have them, that is why I was relating a narrative that says even the members of those committees, they signed a confidentiality agreement.       Even to – my understanding even to SAA staff.       Yes correct.        I was advised at that time, I didn’t read the policy.       It might say that Chair but it is a known factor at SAA that those bid documents are very confidential and theystay at the procurement department and they don’t leave the procurement department Chair.       Yes I was advised that it is very serious and if those documents can leak to the media or anywhere it has got dire consequences for the company because those documents are not supposed to leave procurement department at all.  I would also clarify Chair, to even say, we had to firm up the procurement department in terms of ensuring that we limit the access of other staff members entering into procurement.  After Ms Stimpel took the documents on the floor without permission, so we had to now currently, after Ms Stimpel took the documents at procurement we had to tighten up the security, so not all the SAA employees can enter now into the procurement department, people that are working there have to open for you.      No I did not say that to her, I was instructing her to come back and not attend the meeting because I was even told that I’m with Silas and (indistinct) in my office and he is relating that she took the documents.  I wanted her to come back so that we can level the ground and I can understand from her side as well why did she take the documents that she knows that she is not supposeto have them.       I do not recall saying that to her.     No I don’t remember that I said that Chair.        Correct Chair.       Come again?       No Chair I didn’t investigate, in fact when I joined SAA I was told by two Board members, Ms Myeni and Ms Kwinana already at the time when I joined a legal firm was already appointed to deal with allegations against Dr Darwa and the charges were drafted already, high level, what I understood was one of the charges that was levelled against Dr Darwa was they attendedroadshows – the Board members attended roadshows together with the executives of SAA, specifically where they were explaining to black suppliers the process of how to do tenders and submit to SAA with the view of 30% set aside.  There was a resolution that was taken by the Board before I joined of 30% set aside, meaning all the tenders that are going out at SAA, the bidders should put aside 30% for women, for people with disability, for rural – but it’s four categories Chair.  So my understanding is, when they came back from all the roadshows they gave a list to Dr Darwa of the suppliers that he should include in the database and do business with and Dr Darwa was – didn’t implementthose.  So high level it’s one of the charges that he had but I gave him the suspension letter and after the processes were done, gave him the dismissal letter more because it was a direct line, he was reporting to me.       No Chair.       I accept that chair.       Agreed Chair.       Agreed Chair.       Agreed Chair.       Agreed Chair.       Agreed Chair.       Yes Chair I do.       Yes I accept it Chair, saying it was overtaken by events, yes.       Chair if you may allow just one second theconcluding remarks from my side.       Chair I was – Chair yes I said the cancellation fee is common but I was not specifically saying to this kind of transaction …(intervention).       Chair the cancellation fee is common to the industry and I take that from the experience that I have in auditing this space, so the clauses of penalty and cancellation fees are normal but they are substantiated and they get quantified.  The reason why Iasked BnP for the quantification is – for example if we take an environment of a consulting space before you produce a legal opinion or before we produce an audit opinion there’s a lot of work that you do behind the scenes, your man hours, your disbursements and all that.  So should you cancel, the person that has done the work is entitled to some cancellation fee, so it was in that context where I said it’s common in the industry, hence I was probing BnP and wanting to understand the basis of the cancellation fee because I would understand if they give me the invoice – the flight costs, the man hours of the expertise that they used, they took out of the other projects to goand negotiate the investments.  So it was – for me the amount was exorbitant but I understood the principle.       Chair slightly because when I asked them to substantiate the cancellation fee, which at the end I didn’t agree with it, they said, they attempted to give a breakdown of - I’m not sure where is it on the file…(intervention).       Chair they gave the breakdown of the man hours, the experience that they are using to negotiate the fees, they listed also the flight costs, their accommodation and on top of that they then said in that letter that Grissag AG should SAA cancel will charge them 5million US Dollars.       So these three, that’s why I’m saying slightly Chair.       Yes I do Chair, yes.      Yes sir.       Yes I do Chair.      Yes it does Chair because when we discussed he success fee rate it’s exactly that, to say the agreement was, you go get 15billion and we’ll pay you the success fee of 1.5%, hence when they introduced this new term and this new clause ofcancellation fee, which was never part of the agreement  when we gave them the letter of award, we had to take it back to the Board because it’s a new clause and it needs to be deliberated by the Board because it’s an addition, basically, to what was discussed so it look like, as you’re rightfully saying,  if they make a phone call and then they will and we cancel because also SAA is a  public entity they’ve got challenges, we might cancel so at the back of my mind Chair, if you ask me, I agree with you but my question that  I had or my suspicion, which was  eventually then confirmed to be correct, my understanding is BnP knew that at the time – knew that their FSB license was cancelled orwas suspended by FSB and they wanted to get money out of SAA irrespective, whether it’s 256million or whether it’s 49.9million because one, they misled us or they misrepresented and gave us still the FSB license yet they knew that it’s suspended but now they then wanted another way of getting money out of SAA by – because they know that FSB license is suspended and should SAA know that the contract will be cancelled and then now they roped in a new clause of the cancellation fee.       Chair I was talking about the success fee but I was then generalising on the cancellation fee to say it is the norm if you cancel and yet there’s goods and services, I was not specific to this transaction.       It’s not a norm Chair.      Yes.       Chair that’s the matter that I expected to be raised by the acting CEO hence I came back and discussed it withhim because the day-to-day running of the business, the acting CEO is the one whose responsible for that and also if you look at the structure of SAA the Board gets involved in appointing the CEO and also in recommending or – in recommending and approving the CFO only, all the other structures below that the Board doesn’t get involved.       Yes Chair it would be fair especially if you say the balance would be to protect the company and also to protect my well-being, well-being being – I was scared not to be harmed and all what we’ve discussed, yes Chair but also the focus, as I’ve been saying is, my work ethics are known Chair in the industry and I’ve always worked towards acting in the best interest of the company and protecting the assets of the company.       Chair I would discuss this with the actingCEO, I think eventually we agreed that, let’s just put it there and then engage them behind the scenes.       Yes I didn’t want her to see that and also I didn’t – I was not comfortable and I didn’t want her to even know that behind the scenes I’m talking to the other Board members, roping that they must not approve it.       I didn’t ask them Chair, I assumed that the content is understood.       Yes Chair.       Maybe Chair before that you forgot to…(intervention).      Yes please Chair.  Thank you so much Chair I really appreciate this opportunity that we get in this Commission I appreciate it more especially from the executive point of view, for us to be heard of the frustrations that we go through on a day-to-day basis and I’d like to say, I think you tried to ask me a question yesterday and I attempted to answer the question where you asked if I was the right person, perhaps, for the job I would want to re-affirm that I strongly believe that I was the right person for the job and – but I never foresee the pressures that would come which were basically not part of yourday-to-day running of the business.  So when I joined SAA I was very excited to be in the team that will turn around the company but the challenges Chair have made me a better person, let alone the fact that I ended up not having a job but I believe that I’ve learnt a lot from SAA and any company that I’ll be joining, I’ll be  using all the wisdom.  One of the things that I take out is, when I joined I was very naïve, thinking all the Board members will always act in the best interest of the companies, thank you Chair.       It’s my pleasure, thank you Chair. 
ADV NOSANDISO SOVITI ZWEDALA:   Thank you Mr Commissioner, when I raised the hand at the time there is a critical aspect of Mr Mahlangu’s evidence which I was of the view that it would enrich the Commission’s engagement with this witness if it was put to this witnessbefore she leaves the stand but on conferring with him, he is happy that he will deal with it in his testimony, and given the time constraints as well we will address it then.

MR TIMOTHY NHLANHLA NGWENYA:  I am Timothy Nhlanhla Ngwenya.    Not all all Ma’am.   Yes I do.    So help me God.    It talks to my position Chair.  I am employed as the Divisional Manager Security Management.  I am actually solely responsible for the security and investigation functionwithin the entity.    Yes.    I am saying Chair I am employed as the Divisional Manager Security Management.  I am responsible for the overall security function and investigation within theentity.  I actually joined SA Express in 2014 on the 6 January as a Security Compliance Officer and I operated as that until April 2015 when I started acting a Security Specialist / Manager.  I was in that position until April 2018 when I was appointed Divisional Manager Security Management and my appointed was dated back to February of that year.  I still report to the ICEO Mr – Ms Siza Mzimela and ja that is basically it.    Okay.    You mean at the time Ma’am?    Okay.  During 2015 actually prior to the investigation I was reporting to Ms Merriam Mochoele who was the legal who was the legal risk and compliance general manager.      Yes she was the general manager legal risk and compliance which means the security management fell under her wing as well.  She was also responsible for that.  During the time when the investiga – I started this investigation in particular around June there was somebody who was brought in – appointed as a divisional manager safety and security by the name of Ms Brenda Mblanene.  I think at the time when the investigation startedor when I – you know I started this investigation I think she was about a month old within SA Express hence in most of or rather throughout she is not even mentioned.  Because when this whole thing – this investigation was or rather the whistle blowing – when I was called I did not even speak to her because of truth of the matter is that the matter was not to disrespect but above her pay grade.  So I had bypass her and go back to Ms Mochoele and the CEO.  In fact what actually happened Chair that was the 24 June 2016 the afternoon just after three I received a call from a lady who claimed that she was from the North West and she wanted to report corruption against one of theGM’s within SA Express whom at the time she alleged that this person was interfering with her company and she wanted to – he wanted to actually take over the company.  And she was prepared to go to media in particular Mail and Guardian to report this.  I was really concerned and I felt that you know facts may be misconstrued somehow and you know I was concerned about the company’s reputation you know getting tainted.  And I requested the lady to give me an opportunity to meet with her so I can understand exactly as what was the issue all about.      Yes.    Okay it was Ms Babadi Tlatsana.   Mr Brian Tebogo Van Wyk was the GM Commercial at SA Express.    Yes.  I therefore pleaded withher not to go on and I requested that we meet and the meeting took place the following in Mafikeng Mall where you know on the very same Friday we agreed we would meet between eight and half past eight.  So the following day which was a Saturday I left my house very early at approximately four o’clock am and drove to the North West to meet with this lady.  Because of – on the day she had – gave me her description you know to say she looks like this and she will be wearing 123.  So I went to the North West and I got there and I must say that I was pushing to get there first so I can identify her as you know she walked in and indeed it happened like that. Because when I got there she was not really there and I saw her through the window as she was coming in.  I suspected that it could be her and when she walked in she looked around and I could you know when our eyes met we could see that it was her and then she approached me, introduced herself to say Ms Babadi Tlatsana the owner or director of Koreneka Trading and Projectsand Trading something like that – that company okay which is the handling company for SA Express.  Then I introduced …    Yes Ma’am.    Okay.    Yes.   Okay as an airline when we fly to particular destinations, airports you would have a company doing the ground handling for us because of we are not doing the ground handling we only doing the air services, flying passengers and all that.  Therefore we would source or rather outsource the function to specific companies that would provide you know [indistinct] our passengers you know the logistics on the ground. So in this instance Koreneka was doing the checking which means they were processing passengers as they were checking in, loading baggage you know and so forth but the ground services.  So this Koreneka was providing that service to SA Express which means there was an agreement of some sort between SA Express and Koreneka for this specific service where SA Express was expected of course to remunerate Koreneka for the services renderedto SA Express.    At that time Koreneka was providing the services in two airports.  One which was Pilanesburg and the other one was Mafikeng airport.    Both located in the North West yes.    It was the checking in, the baggage loading, the boarding of passengers it is actually a process.  It is a value chain of some sort Chair.    Yes.    Up to the – board the aircraft.    Absolutely.    Absolutely Chair,    Absolutely.   Correct.    Okay firstly I had to probe her pertaining the allegation that she raised the previous day about MrBrian Van Wyk.  Mr Tlatsana told me that like I said that she was the owner – the sole owner of – she was the owner of Koreneka Trading and Projects which was providing this ground handling services to SA Express and then she informed me that she had the dealings with SA Express in particular Mr Van Wyk because of – she got through to Express via Mr Van Wyk.  What she explained to me was that initially when this whole thing started about the project there was a meeting somewhere in the North West where she gave a proposal to revive the air services or rather the airports within the North West. You know that she was interested in reviving that and then at that time I there were talks between – according to her Chair – there were talks between SA Express and the North West Department of Transport you know to have a deal to have SA Express you know flown into the area and all that.  And she said somehow somebody referred her to Mr Van Wyk to say she can speak to Mr Van Wyk who is the general manager for SAExpress and I must say at the time Mr Van Wyk’s department was spearheading the project for – this project in the North West.  She said to me she provided the documents to Mr Van Wyk which means that was the company profile and the statutory document you know to provide that service as it was a proposal.  Then Mr Brian Van Wyk she said took that stuff and later on confirmed to her that she stands a chance of getting you know the job.  For the simple reason that she was a woman number 1 and she was from the very same area which is North West of which the government was actually interested in giving local people empowering – empowering them in fact.  So Mr Van Wyk told herthat the only disadvantage was that she was the sole owner of the organisation of that company and therefore on those basis that would limit her chances of being awarded the work.  He then advised her to get somebody you know to be partnered with her and she suggested at the time to Mr Van Wyk that she would prefer to have her sister on board as a partner.  Mr Van Wyk told her that it cannot work because it would be seen as nepotism.  You know family members and all that.  And Mr Van Wyk suggested that he can bring two individuals that can actually assist her as she did not have the experience you know pertaining to the service that she wants to provide.  He said he would bring two people that can actually create more opportunities for her going forward and they would assist her with the management as they are knowledgeable you know in relation to what she was to provide – the service that she was to provide.  And she agreed to that.  And then later on Mr Van Wyk brought two individuals to this – to her to say sheneeded to add these people as part of the owners of this organisation.  So the names that Mr Van Wyk brought I take it that also with their identities and everything else that needed to be done was a Mr Victor Thabeng who was supposed to be a partner and Ms Joyce Phiri and he brought the two and they held about 66%, 33/33 whilst she was the majority shareholder of 34%.  So that is how the Koreneka ownership was actually altered then they became part of Koreneka.  She said that they – they provided services of course but the other thing that she mentioned to me was that she was not actively involved.  I may have omitted this information Chair on my affidavit I am thinking because of– there were quite a lot of things that were happening around that time.  So she said she was not actively participating and this could be supported by one of the audio recordings where they were sitting I think at the Spur restaurant where she mentioned that I am not known as the owner of this organisation you the only one Mr Van Wyk that is known but I will deal with that as you know I continue leading with this – I mean with this – going through my affidavit or my testimony.  You know as we were sitting there she said to me there was plenty that she wanted to give me in terms of the evidence you know documentary evidence that relates to the whole thing how it started, how they went on and who was actually you know part of this entity and she even went on to mention that you know for that matter she did not even appoint a single person in her entity relating to this ground handling.  Now Mr Chair you know we were at three places around that day because of we had to move from Wimpy where I was having breakfast when shearrived anyway.  We had to move from there to her house that is when I got to see her house. We fetched some documents and some audio recordings.  It was quite a lot of stuff we then went to her office where you know Koreneka was actually operating within Mafikeng CBD.    Yes.    Page 5 okay.    Yes.    Okay.  Thank you.  Chair from point 15 of this affidavit she confirmed to me that she signed an agreement with SA Express that relates to the Pilanesberg and Mafikeng airports and that Mr Van Wyk did not give her a copy of the contract.  She also said to me that in actual fact the plan was that Mr Van Wyk was supposed to help her until she find her footing to be ableto manage that contract.  However after you know appointing the two directors she claimed – or – she told me that Mr Van Wyk brought a person by the name of Mr David Kalisilira who was the – supposed to be the company’s accountant as they also had to agree that she would run with you know the running of the finances you know.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay thanks.  I was actually going there Ma’am.  Chair as I said that she brought Mr Kalisilira first as a financial you know accountant then she brought also a person by the name of Mr Levy Sipho Phiri who then appointed Ms Nothando Dube to run with the operation as a manager you know, Koreneka’s manager to run with the you know administrative and operational side of things within Koreneka while Ms Tlatsana was not really involved. She was actually hands off.    She said that Mr Sipho Phiri was also involved in the appointment of the very same ground handling staff.  That obviously you know they have done the check in and all the other functions with you know that are related to the contract.    Can you repeat that Ma’am?    And the paragraph that you are referring to with it?    Okay.   Okay.    Yes.    Yes.  As I was speaking to her itbecame apparent to me that she did not really know the content of the service level agreement because as we were talking she kept on referring to Mr Van Wyk telling him that this needed to be done and how and when and that there is money that needs to be paid from that account I mean from – by Koreneka you know as the facility manager.  Maybe I need to clarify quickly this.  We are talking about a [indistinct] relationship here where there was the North West Department of Transport.  There was SA Express. There was Koreneka.  Now Koreneka was the service provider to both entities.  Koreneka was the facility manager for the North West government and was appointed for that specific function by SAA – by SA Express on behalf of the North West government.  I am saying this just to clarify matters so we can not confuse issues.  On the other hand Koreneka was providing the ground handling services for SA Express.  SA Express appointed Koreneka to provide that service.  Now because of here I am talking about theCCTV, I am talking about functions that had absolutely nothing to do with SA Express that is the reason I am giving this clarity.  So we – you understand Chair as to where I am coming from.  Now in this regard I am saying she did not understand the content of the contract.  I would say both contracts because she stated clearly to say she did not – Mr Van Wyk did not give her any contract.  She signed but she did not receive the copies of the contract and then she relied on him.  In this regard where would – I speak about the CCTV, I speak about anything that has to do with the airport refurbishment whatsoever had absolutely nothing to do with the SA Express service level agreement but theNorth West.   Now she relied on Mr van Wyk and she said to me because of – Mr Chair – out of the bundle that she gave me there were invoices, expense authorisation, money – you know – amounting to R51 million that was paid to Koreneka and on those invoices she said she did not prepare even a single invoice – you know – to – to claim the remuneration from either entity of which with SA Express she never even submitted a single invoice at that particular time. Therefore she said it clearly to me that she did not really submit anything and though the money went into her account – you know …    Yes.    At some stage of this whole – whole thing as I said that Ms – Ms Dube was the Manager managing Koreneka.  The – Ms Tlatsana actually dismissed Ms Dube – you know – as the Manager for Koreneka.  Maybe because of their differences or she did not really report to her. She was in fact reporting to Mr van Wyk.  He then dismissed her and that started this whole friction between her and - I mean Ms Tlatsana - and Mr van Wyk where Mr van Wyk was not really happy about the dismissal of – of Ms Dube.  I would assume that becauseMs Dube was brought Ms – Mr Sipho Phiri who was brought by Mr van Wyk. Hence she was not really perhaps – he was not really satisfied and then he threatened Ms Tlatsana to say he will take the contract and give it to somebody else as he was the one who actually brought this and that Mr Chair can be confirmed via either the – the audio recordings or the SMS’ – you know – exchanged between Ms Tlatsana and Mr Brian van Wyk. At that time Mr Brian van Wyk was utilising his own personal cellphone and also whatever communication that was between them via email it was not on SA Express – you know – email account but on his personal Gmail account.  So strange that you run - you know – company business but you – you are putting your own (intervenes).    Yes.   Hm.    At the – it was actually …    It was prior because obviouslyas she generated the story to say these were - were the issues – the conflicts that – you know – happened.  It was actually prior before – I mean – prior our meeting.    So …    Already.    At that juncture when we met …    She – she took charge because – she had fired Ms Nothanda Dube and I think at that time replaced her with – with somebody else – a Ms (indistinct) Lewis.  Something like that.   Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Obviously Chair – no it is not obvious – because of the conflict Chair between Mr van Wyk and Ms Tlatsana and threatening to – to take her out I think Mr van Wyk took a drastic step to actually try and replace Koreneka.  Now Mr Chair I must bring this to your attention to say the contract that was signed it was for a period of 5 years. Now Koreneka was providing like two different kind of services to two different entities.  However Mr van Wyk decided to say no he would terminate as promised then Valoteck came into the picture.  This Valoteck how it came into the picture Mr …    Mr van Wyk’s position at SA Express was the General Manager Commercial.    No, no SA Express.    SA Express.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair …    He was the Head …    Of the Commercial Department.    Yes.    It is the name of the company ma’am.    Correct ma’am correct.    Yes.    Correct ma’am.    At the time - remember the - the contract between Koreneka and – and Express as well as the North West was actually still on.  It was still effective but because of this misunderstanding Mr van Wyk wanted to take Koreneka out. He then appointed Valoteck and when Valoteck came into the picture they were supposed to take over from – from Koreneka because at the time when she told me she said - it was June - and she said Valoteck was appointed effective May – I think - 1 May but when they were supposed to take over this – this Valoteck take over from – from Koreneka at that time Koreneka – you know – involved – you know – their legal representation. That is Ms Tlatsana who - who did exactly that because at that time she was the sole owner of the organisation.  So she told me that she – she threatened SA Express with the lawyers to say there is going – you know – they would take SA Express on – on the basis thatthey were breaching the Service Level Agreement, yes.    That is correct ma’am.    As I stated that Valoteck did notconduct any services either for ground handling or for facility management.  However I received information.  I was told that the North West Government paid or the Department of Transport – the North West Department of Transport paid an amount around the region of 15 million to – to Valoteck – you know – for – clearly providing the service that they did not really do.    Valoteck did not provide any service to SA Express.  There is no record within SA Express that would indicate that Valoteck provided a service and as far as I know they did not provide a service to the North West because of Koreneka hung onto the contract until such time they were taken out when MAMCO moved in which is another company (indistinct) but what I also established was that Valoteck after receiving the money they liquidated – after receiving that 15 million.   In actual fact the very same services that were provided or rendered by Koreneka as the contracts …    It is a cut and paste from Koreneka to Valoteck with different figures …    In terms of remuneration fromthe SA Express side.    No, no Chair.    No.  Hence I said that when I started the investigation it was June and the contract was stil – you know – ongoing - the Koreneka one.  Valoteck was appointed effective May of the very same year.  So Valoteck did not really take over from – from Koreneka. In actual fact Ms Tlatsana told me that Ms Nothanda Dube was spreading rumours that Koreneka was to leave the airport and be – you know – be replaced Valoteck.  So Valoteck was going to take over from Koreneka but that did not materialise …    Because Valoteck – I mean – Koreneka - you know – hung onto the – to this contract.    Absolutely Chair.  At the time when I was actually investigating I discovered that Koreneka – I mean – Valoteck was appointed by SA Express through an RFQ process wherethree quotes were requested from the market – you know – for the provision in fact of labour broking - you know – labour brokerage services. So that is how Valoteck was brought into Express and if I my memory serves me well Valoteck was the only entity that responded to that request which was sent out – you know – for quotation.  So the contract that was between SA Express at the time within SA Express the contract was not available. There was just an award letter – you know – for Valoteck to provide the labour brokerage services.  The contract – let me put it this way.  There was no signed contract …    At the time.    I did not see any signedcontract between SA Express and even during my investigation when I went to different departments to try and establish as to whether we have a copy or not I was actually told that we do not have a signed contract at the time.    SA Express and Valoteck yes.    Hm.    Okay.  Maybe I am too forward Chair …    But if you look at the Valoteck contract – the actual contract – that was …    Yes.    Yes (intervenes).    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.   That is correct.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Absolutely.    Thank you.  Ms Dube was the owner of Valoteck.    Of Valoteck.   You know I may have to go back and forth in relation to this.  Like I said that in actual fact if you look at it Chair Ms Dube was appointed as a Manager – you know – for Koreneka by somebody that was brought in by Mr Brian van Wyk.  Now when Ms Dube got fired by Ms Tlatsana – you know – at Koreneka she started a company which was Valoteck. Now in this company there were two.  I think it was – she was a 50 percent holder – you know – of the shareholding and there was another person by the name of – I think – Kefilwe Mogodiri.  ThisKefilwe Mogodiri also held a 50 percent part of the shares.  Now that is why I am saying there is a continuation with Ms - Ms Dube. Now Mr van Wyk was not satisfied with her dismissal and she appoint – he appointed Valoteck.  Now this element – Ms Dube – you know – continued to be part of this whole thing.  She was fired there.  Then Valoteck surfaced and Ms Dube was actually the owner of that entity. To me it was well orchestrated to say you know what we will continue where we – you know – you left off.  So they tried to take out Koreneka by utilising this Valoteck and it did not materialise.    Not really ma’am in that regard because the only thing that I can say I could see just – you know –Ms Dube moving from one entity to the other up to – you know – your prime goal.  So I cannot really – I do not have anything tangible to say – you know – there is – they had this relationship or whatsoever.    Yes.      Oh, eish, I am old school.      Chair she handed me a bunch of documentary evidence which consisted of the contracts, that is the contract between S A Express and the Northwest Government and the contract between S A Express and Koreneka, and the sms communication between Ms Tlatsana and Mr van Wyk.  She also handed me the bank statement, the Koreneka bank statement that depicted asto how much was paid into Koreneka by S A Express and the Northwest Government and how it was disbursed after you know it was received.  You know the transactions that took place after.What else did she give me, correspondence between her and Mr van Wyk and there was one between her and the – where she sent an email to the GM Legal Risk and Compliance, it was quite a number of those and the audio recordings quite a number of those audio recordings, some of those audio recordings were recorded over the telephone conversation, some it was on the recorder you know where they were sitting in a particular restaurant around the Northwest, so that’s basically what she handed over to me.     I hope I did not leave anything?      R31million was received from S A Express, however it was not a lump sum, it was in trenches.      Yes, and then the R20million that was coming from the Northwest Department of Transport.      R51million, correct.     The Monday of course let me just say the Sunday I went through the recording but I did not listen to all of them, then the Monday because already I had established through the recording Chair as to how much was Mr van Wyk implicated and all you know the amounts that were involved and that, and that on one of the recordings Mr van Wyk had implicated the Chairperson of the S A Express Board as well as the CEO and ...(intervention)     S A Express Board.    As well as the CEO, Mr Inati Ntshanga.  By the way the Chairperson of the S A Express Board, though he did not mention the name, his name is Mr – the then Chairperson Mr George Muthema.  He also implicated prominent people within the National and Provincial government, Ministers you know and the rest that I would mention as we go along, on his what you call it ...(intervention)     On the recording yes.      Then the Monday I called ...(intervention)     I met with her on a Saturday.    I left the Northwest at night, I got home just before midnight.    Then the Sunday I went through the recordings in particular the one that she played for me where these individuals were implicated.  So I listened on that one, I played that one repeatedly so, so as to understand as to you know what was the whole story.  Then my approach the following day was that I needed to get the CEO and the GM Legal Risk and Compliance together so I candeliver the news,Then the Monday morning I remember on that Monday that was the 27 t h of June there was an Exco meeting that was supposed to take place on that day, so I went to work, arrived early of course, I tried to get hold of Ms Mochoele and without any success, I tried Mr Inati Ntshanga, the CEO, I couldn’t reach him.  When I was at work I think she was on her way to work, I managed to reach her and I told her that you know what I needed to see her urgently and together with the CEO because I’ve got some news to deliver to them and you know it’s pertaining the contract in the Northwest where it is alleged that the GMCommercial, Mr Brian van Wyk you know to a certain extent was manipulating this thing, you know corruption and I indicated to her that I heard evidence supporting the allegation and you know I sat in my office.  On arrival she came directly to my office to listen to what I had to say.    Sorry, sorry Chair, that’s Ms Mochoele.    The GM Legal Risk and Compliance.    Yes.    Okay one how he, Mr van Wyk,implicated the Chairperson and the CO of S A Express, he said they were the ones who actually initiated the deal, who were in charge of the negotiations pertaining this whole deal and that they were aware of the transactions that were taking place you know the movement of money and all that, so they were privy to everything that was happening and that he said he was acting on – based on instructions he was not Mr van Wyk, that’s Mr van Wyk, but he was not doing things on his own.    In one – according to her it was somewhere in the – it’s a recording, it was not a telecom, but she recorded while they were sitting, you know she hid the recorder somehow as they were talking she recorded the whole conversation.    Okay, on this recording, maybeit’s one thing that I did not really mention, I omitted, on this recording Chair as Mr van Wyk was explaining to Ms Tlatsana  you know as to who was supposed to be -  to get paid you now on all the monies, he scribbled on a particular, on a document  he scribbled the names, because at some stage he said I don’t have to mention names, but if you look at the document that I am actually about to talk about and you listen to the recording you would realise that it’s the very same document that as he was talking he was scribbling.   He mentioned the names and the titles to say all of them they were supposed to be paid, in actual fact there was a bit of a disagreement between her MsTlatsana in relation to the amounts to be paid to these individuals.  On that particular recording he mentioned that the Ministers they are supposed to get 20/.20 and Ms Tlatsana objected to that to say but initially you said it’s 10, you’re changing from time to time, you know in terms of how much they were supposed to be paid.  But all of it ...(intervention)     Correct.    Correct.    I think firstly Chair the fact that Mr Van Wyk wanted to take her out of the business replace her company and money was actually spent. There were these illicit transactions you know from her account where money was transferred to numerous accounts the R31 million.  To a certain extent I think she could not really account for the R31 million because of – she was not directly involved in the disbursement of that R31 million.      It came into her account yes.  It came into her account.   I am getting there Chair.  What actually happened this Mr David Kalisilira who was the accountant according to her based on the instruction of Mr Van Wyk because of initially let me mention this.  They had an account with the FNB branch and she me that she was told by Mr Van Wyk to open that account in the first place.  She had to give her account credentials the pins and whatsoever to Mr Kalisilira so she – so he can operate and disperse the funds whichever way yes.  So she actually voluntarily     Based on the instruction.    You know handed that information to Mr Kalisilira who was responsible to handle the funds.   Yes.    Correct Ma’am.    Yes.   Yes.    That is correct.    Correct.    Okay after explaining of course and indicating that the CO in fact I requested or asked him to phone Ms Tlatsana as a confirmation that the matter was brought to his attention.  He agreed to that and I dialled Ms Tlatsana’s contact because of in the room amongst the three of us I was the only one who had her contact atthat juncture.  So I dialled the number of Ms Tlatsana and I made some form of an introduction to say it was me and I am with the CEO and the GM legal risk and compliance and as promised they want to talk to her pertaining the issue.  They introduced themselves to her the CEO Mr Inathi Ntshanga and Ms Mirriam Mochoele and then Ms Tlatsana just let it go.  You know she was talking as if you know she had some form of …    Yes and you know…    To say she has been willing to speak to Mr Ntshanga to report you know what Mr Van Wyk was actually doing to her and you know Mr Van Wyk was sort of taking her for granted, playing with her, wanting to take her company and things like that.  She – you know she poured everything out.  She let it out. But …    Even telling him…    Yes, yes in actual fact that conversation was recorded as well Mr Chair.    That recording was …    That conversation was actuallyrecorded.    Recorded – [laughing] I am sorry.      By Mr Tlatsana.    Yes, yes. I…   She was not playing with fire she was recording almost everything.  When you talk to her you know that she was recording.    Absolutely in fact it is two recordings.    Because during the course of that conversation we were cut off somehow and the CEO stood up and left the room.  I take it that he went to the bathroom.  And I redialled the number Ms Tlatsana and Ms Mochoele had to indicate where to say hey you know what we were cut out and the CEO just left the room buthe will be back he went to the bathrooms.  While she was explaining that the CEO walked in and then the conversation went on again.  And she gave it all.  Then we were done.    Later on I requested those conversations, the recordings from Ms Tlatsana and then she forwarded those to me via Whatsapp.    It was two sets of recordings.    Yes.    Can I step back a bit and get back.    The document that I was talking about the scribbled document.    Yes.    Yes.    Absolutely.  That is what I want to raise yes.    Chair as I have explained that you know I brought the evidence, the recordings and all that and I specifically mentioned the parts that was actually relevant to them in terms of the recording.  I also produced this documents – this documentwhich was scribbled you know and it was – Ms Tlatsana alleged that it was Mr Van Wyk who wrote on this document.  So I produced this documents – this document and I showed it to the CEO and the GM legal.    Come again?    At that meeting yes.    It was on Monday the very sameMonday.    Yes, yes.    Yes Chair.  So when I produced this document the CEO looked at it and he confirmed the writing on this document as that of Mr Brian Van Wyk the CM Commercial and the GM Legal Ms Merriam Mochoele concurred with this – with Mr Ntshanga to say indeed this was the handwriting of Mr Van Wyk.  Then it was clear definitely that Mr Van Wyk was somehow involved in this whole thing.  I then said to or rather advised the CEO to say based on the nature of these transactions the amount involved and the fact that Mr Brian Van Wyk was an employee of SA Express and the GM for that matter I mean the amount that was involved in this regard was the R31 million thatcame out of the SA Express account – I mean – account.  I advised the CE based on Section 34 of The PRECCA Act 12 of 2004 that she had a responsibility as a person who is in the position of authority to report these transactions to the authorities.      Correct Ma’am.    Yes.    Yes.    Absolutely, absolutely Ma’am.    Yes.    That is correct Ma’am.    I think there were three facts that I had to establish and all those were around the appointment of Koreneka and the allegations that were made by Mr Tlatsana pertainingto Mr Van Wyk.  I had to establish if what she alleged was true or not.  I also had to establish if the appointment of Koreneka was as per I think the procurement process within Express and also the appointment of Koreneka as a facility management was as according to the agreement between SA Express and the North West government.    I think I am correct in saying that.    When he gave me that mandateit was not a written mandate Chair it was a verbal.  As far as this is concerned I think you know in any case when you are given a mandate it has to be written especially when you dealing with people you know who are on a higher level than yourself.  So that I did not get.  But then I raised two issues with him to say much as you have given me this scope and the mandate I want to make it clear to you that  1.  I can only be able to investigate all the transgressions that occurred within SA Express and that secondly 2. I will not be able to investigate any party that is outside SA Express because I do not have any authority towards those individuals. And the fact that prominent people were implicated I may not be able to establish the facts around that including the implication of the SA Express board chairperson.  That is what I said to him in relation to the scope.   Yes.    Correct.    The legal department at the time was responsible for the contract management which means every contract that SA Express was involved in they were kept at legal, the files were kept at legal.  So after the meeting with Ms Mochoele the GM Legal and the CEO.  After we listened to the recordings and you know giving everything I went to the legal department after being given the mandate to say – to try and establish as to whether there was a contract in place in the first place you know.  So when I got to legal at the time there was a person who was the legal advisor by the name Ms Nasiphi Mkentane.  I went and spoke to her pertaining the issue and I said to her I was actually looking for the contract for the North Westwhich involved Koreneka you know.  Ms Mkentane said to me North West I do not have the contract that relates to the North West you know ground handling services but one thing that I can tell you is that I drafted the contract in relation to the ground handling services in the North West in particular the Pilanesberg.  However on that contract she did – she was not aware as to who was the company that was to you know provide the service.  So she drafted the contract and forwarded it to Mr Brian Van Wyk without a company name and if my memory serves me well without the figures as to how much was you know to be paid to this actually to this entity.  And she indicated somehow to say it was aninstruction that she received either by Mr Van Wyk or Ms Mochoele and she said to me she will forward everything to me.  I then left her office on that day.  Then the following morning I recall because of you know I went through that email.  I think it was around twenty five past eight that was on the 28 t h she emailed me…    June, June, sorry 28 t h.    2016.    2016.    2016.    Tlatsana.    Yes.    It was June the 24 t h.    It is still the week.    Exactly yes.  So it is the dayafter I met – it was the 27 t h I met with the CE and I met her then the following day on the 28 t h June the Tuesday Ms Mkentane forwarded me the contract relating to the draft actually relating to the service in Pilanesberg.    Okay.    Yes.    That is correct Ma’am.   You mean the email?    The email is from Ms Meriam Mochoele to the then GM or General Manager Operations Mr Brian – I mean Mr Dave Allenby.  Also to Mr Brian Tebogo Van Wyk who was the GM Commercial.    At SA Express.   And copied to Ms Nasiphi Mkentane.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh she was directly speaking to Mr Van Wyk.    I can simply read this part?     “@Brian I guess we need to ask the province to advise us as to who the management company is going to be so that we can meet with them just tomake sure that there is an understanding on what is expected.  As well as go through the financial aspects.”    Yes.    My impression at the time especially pertaining to that email is that Ms Mochoele was well aware – let me just explain this.  Ms Mochoele as a GM she was also the chairperson of the BAC the Bid Adjudication Committee, she was the chairperson.  Now the impression that I got was that she had a knowledge already around in April that there was no procurementprocess followed because as a matter of fact this was supposed to be brought to the BAC because of the figures on the contract.  They exceeded the R500 000.00 which is RFQ so it was RFP.  There was supposed to be a request for proposals.  Now as the chairperson of the BAC she knew at the time that nothing was brought to her attention and yet she continued you know to entertain the issue and further you know allowing her department to draft a contract you know to that effect knowing this or that there was no procurement process that was followed and that was a violation.    Okay remember there were – I mentioned that there were payments made to the amount of R31 million.  So already at that juncture I had established that with legal there was no file or agreement that was there.  My next step was to go to the finance department so as to establish as to how was this money paid to Koreneke and that much as well.  So I went to the finance department and I interviewed the supervisor there by the name of Ms Busisiwe Mavuso.  Ms Busisiwe Mavuso confirmed to me that yes indeed there were payments that were made to the – to that R31 million and that there were invoices submitted to the department.    She was the supervisor atfinance.      The – she is supervising the creditors clerks.    And all that.  Yes.  The payment processes.    The payments are processed and all that and they go to treasury.  So now she said to me she wasgiven the invoices and the expense authorisation.  Now the invoices were Koreneke invoices claiming you know payments from SA Express and also there were expense authorisation.  Expense authorisation it is an internal documents – SA Express internal document where when there is money to be spent you know payments or whatsoever you know certain individual who are designated to sign as per the DOA, Delegation of Authority Chair in terms of the amounts that are reflected on that document they would sign that document.  So in that regard Ms Busisiwe produced those documents.  It was four invoices and four expense authorisations which were approved by Mr Van Wyk you know and Mr Inati Ntshanga the CEO also endorsed you know he appended his signature sort of approve these what you call – these payments.    Yes.   Correct.    Yes.    This when I interviewed MsMabuso she stated that she was verbally instructed by the CFO Mr Mark Shelly the then CFO Mr Mark Shelly to say she needed to load the details of Koreneka on our vendor – you know as a vender on the SAPS system and once information is uploaded there it is definitely for the purpose of payments.    Now this actually happened on the 5 May.  Now Mr Chair on the – one of the invoices and expense of you would see that was prepared day before for payment and on the 5 t h Mr Mark Shelly instructed her to say load on the system.  She did exactly that and there is a document in this – on the bundle that gives an indication to say this was actually done on the 5 May where Koreneka’s details were uploaded on SAP. The following day 8.5 million was transferred from SA Express account into the Koreneka account.    Yes.    Yes.  On this instance we had a plan.  I must indicate Chair that I could hardly recall the number of meetings that we had between myself, Mr Inathi Ntshaga and Ms Merriam Mochoele.  Now there was a plan on the day – there was a disciplinary hearing on that day against a subordinate of Mr Brian Van Wyk and of course I gave – I testified on that day. But the plan was that we needed to suspend or the company needed to suspend Mr Brian Van Wyk.  So we had a plan in place and the plan was only known to myself, the then employee relations senior specialist Ms Nomfusi Dakene and it was also known to her boss the GM of HC Human Capital which is HR Ms Kgatile Nkala and of course the CEO.  Now the plan was that he would be suspended and I would confiscate his access card and – you know – the laptop all those gadgets and therefore walk him out except for the cellphone because he needed still to report. He was still an employee and I needed to escort him out ofthe premises.  Then we planned to say we are going to execute.  Now if my memory services me well because Ms Dagenie was sitting in that and we had plotted it to say once you are done you give me an indication.  So I can come up and we can execute as planned. I remember at that time when she – I think she sent me an SMS.  I cannot recall how she – she – but I think it was an SMS or a WhatsApp.  Now – to say we are ready.  We can action.  I went to – to the ACGM because she needed to be present and advised her to say we are ready.  We can go. I walked with her to Mr Brian van Wyk where the disciplinaryhearing was actually taking place of his subordinate.  When I got there as we were walking – you know – at third floor because he was busy at third floor.  From the second floor we went to the third floor.  Ms Nkala stayed behind.  She spoke to somebody. I think that was deliberate Mr Chair because I ended up walking into the office alone and as we were talking and about to execute the plan I heard Ms Nkala talking towards the door of Mr van Wyk.  She was talking to somebody within – you know – the - the company around the third floor. I could hear her voice and because of Mr Brian van Wyk how he was seated he could see – you know – in between the gap of the door and the other side of his office.  Now I saw him looking towards the door and back to us and I just said excuse me.  He said excuse me.  That was the last time I saw him.  So my view …    He left – he said excuse me.    Now the GMHC did not enter the room.  He stood right at the door.  He looked towards the door and he looked at us and he said guys excuse me.  He stood up and went out of the office.  That was the last time I saw him.  So what it means Mr van Wyk disappeared from the premises. He ran away literally ran away.  He was advised and honestly I can certainly bet the GMHC advised him accordingly.  So he disappeared.   Come again?    Absolutely.    I do not – I do not know for a fact.    I do not know for a fact, know.  I cannot say that.  It is just that he looked at where she was standing and he stood up.  Then he did not come back and she did not come back too.  She did not come back too.    With me.   Hence my assumption is that she is the person that gave the information to Mr van Wyk.    Yes.  She remained in the company.    No.    I did not even confront herbecause we waited there and we - we noticed that he was not coming back.  We stood out to try and look and he was gone.  I did not even confront her really.  I did not.  That was it.  That is how it (intervenes).    That is correct.    No disciplinary action was taken against Mr Brian van Wyk.  However I was requested by the GM Legal Risk and Compliance Ms Mochoele to write up charges in relation to the transgression that Mr Brian van Wyk has committed for the purpose of – you know – dealing with the matter.   Disciplining him.  I did exactly that with the assistance of the Employer Relations Senior Specialist Ms Dagenie.  We tabled those charges and later on I handed the hard copy to Ms Mochoele.    That is right ma’am.    When I indicated that - you know - the best way was to hand this over to a forensic investigator.  Firstly the purpose was that – you know – I could see that there was something deeper than I thought on this whole thing.  So I wanted – you know – the whole thing to be exposed. Moreover it was becoming clearer to me that he was definitely involved - the CEO was definitely involved.  So I said you know what I recommend that you give the matter to a forensic investigator.  His response to me was that no it is not a good idea because the forensic investigator was definitely going to go – to blow this whole thing out of proportion.    That is correct ma’am.    Not at all ma’am.  I – I – Chair when I went there – in actual fact I interviewed two people.  The first one it was on the - I think – the 4 t h.    I spoke to Mr Zakaria Rabotata who is the Procurement Officer as SA Express and he is still there.  I inquired about the tender issued or advertised pertaining – you know – this ground handling in – in the North West.  He said he was not aware of any – you know – of such.  He looked on his system. He did not find anything no deviation no business case.  Nothing in relation to the procurement process.  So he confirmed to me that there was nothing.  Then later on I went to his boss Ms (indistinct) who was the Divisional Manager of the Procurement Department.  I interviewed her pertaining to two issues.The first one was Koreneka in relation to the procurement processes whether you – she was aware.  Whether she had any documentation within the procurement space that she can provide to me – you know – as proof that somehow the process was actually followed and she said she was not involved in – in any of such. Probably her predecessor was definitely involved because of now the second element was this Valoteck.  Remember I had already – I was already informed about Valoteck taking over and I wanted to know about Valoteck and I said to her okay the Valoteck Contract what happened.Do we have a contract first within our procurement space?  She said SA Express does not – does not have a signed contract to that effect – Valoteck/Express.  I remember at that juncture there was a file and that file spoke to the RFQ process where she requested the quotes from the three companies.    Three companies yes.    Okay.    Okay.    Okay.   Correct.    Correct Chair.    19 May 2016.    It is “Provision of LabourBroking Services/Three Quotes”.    Absolutely.    Correct.    It was not there.    That is correct.   That is correct.  Yes and of course the correspondence.  The emails – you know – requesting quotes from …    Three entities of which the respondent was only – or the company that responded was Valoteck.    Yes because when the quoteswere requested it was about labour broking services not ground handling.    That is correct.    That is correct.    As I recall – in fact on 6 October after finalising or compiling that report I took it and showed it to the GM Legal to say I am done with the report.  This is it.  I am about to hand it over to Mr Ntshanga and I did exactly that.  If I am not mistaken I handed over the document not on that day. It is either the following week – I am – I cannot remember clearly on that but when I gave that report to him I told him that it is –it is the report and it is a – a Preliminary Investigation Report.  I – I indicated to him at the time to say but we have sufficient to actually charge Mr van Wyk – you know. We had sufficient evidence against him.  So we can deal with that.  However there are issues that – you know – I could not sort of reach.  Therefore hence it remained a Preliminary Investigation Report.    Long, long, long after.  Long after Chair.   Long after.  Long after he disappeared.    He disappeared …    In July.    1 July he disappeared.    October.    Yes.  Now …    Yes, yes Chair.  It was – it was on that.  One, I must indicate Chair that as I said that I was responsible to run security.  I was the sole member of the Security Department responsible for different areas within the security space.  I can break them …    You know – break it down to aviation security.  Now aviation security deals with the regulation. Now there are parts that I was actually supposed to deal with within the –the civil aviation – you know – regulation which is Part 108 that deals with (indistinct) security. I was responsible for that and I was the designated officer for (indistinct) security within the entity.  Number two, I was also responsible for a Part 109 to ensure that every single employee involved in the operation was trained – you know – the security training was provided to those individuals. It was my responsibility to ensure that everyone within the company - now Chair you must understand that my operation was not limited to OR Tambo.  I was actually responsible entirely for the – you know – operation within and outside South Africa.  All those airports I was actually responsible singlehandedly. Now there was also the Part 111 which is aviation security – you know – that talks to the designation as well - you know – as a – as a Security Manager.  You know which somehow is in – is in line with thePart 121 in terms of the AOC.  The AOC which is the Airline Operator Certificate. So – you know – I am all over the show.  Now there was Corporate Security that I was responsible for.  There was physical security that I was also responsible for and – you know – investigations as well.  So (intervenes).    Absolutely.    No, no I am just trying to clarify Chair.    So that you can get the picture.    Well …    Yes.  In fact at that time I was already reporting to him directly.    I was a direct report.  So based on the instruction from the (indistinct) Authority to say as a designated person I have to report to the highest office in the – in the company.  So based on that I was already reporting to him.  So Ms Maleni andMs Mochoele were really out of the picture.    So I was directly reporting to him.  Now on that day when I spoke to him on that meeting I – I reiterated the Section 34 to say you have a responsibility.  You need to report this and that was in the presence of Ms Merriam Mochoele who perhaps here there is nothing that can substantiate that but just for the interest – you know – of this evidence Chair. Ms Mochoele confirmed to a Board Member – Mr Trevor Abrahams – who confronted us after before he actually opened a case in relation to this – you know – (indistinct).  She confirmed that I actually advised the CE about this section.  So ja that was- that was it.    Yes.    Yes Chair.  In fact I omitted part of that information because it was quite a lot.  In this regard Chair after we have discussed this report and I have already explained to him tosay what the reason was for me to hand him the preliminary.  I have explained that.  The investigation was not concluded even though we had enough to deal with Mr van Wyk when I gave him that report. Now I waited as I was busy not that I sit back and look at what he was actually doing but – you know – I thought he would act on the recommendation of my – you know – on – on the Preliminary Report recommendation and I actually realised that – you know – he was not really acting and Chair I must indicate that he wanted us – you know – to discuss the matter throughout verbally so.  No email (intervenes).    Discuss, discuss.    Yes.  That we discuss whatever issue the updates and all that I must not send emails.  We must sit and talk about it.  Now I handed this report to him.  You know – I delivered– hand delivered to him.  Now I am waiting and I see the clock is ticking.  No action is actually taken. Now – you know – at that time I figured out to say – you know – this might place me in a very awkward position in that there was no trail – you know – paper trail or emails showing that there was an interaction – you know – between me, him – you know – in relation to this. I therefore decided on the very same month to email the very same report to one of – or at the time I was not really aware.  I emailed to – to him.  On 8 November a lady who was working …   Still 2016 yes.    The very same month Chair.  The following month on 8 November after the 31 s t after I forwarded.  I received a call from a lady who was a communication specialist – she – she still is within the company.  She said to me I am sorry I am not interfering with your investigation whatsoever but I can see that you have sent a report onto this email – you know – which belongs to Mr Ntshanga but this email is also used by the Communication Department – you know – to communicate whatever – you know – that is received from Mr Ntshanga. Therefore – you know – we have access to this report.  However I have deleted it.  I can swear - you know - I am not privy to the content.  Therefore sent this email directly to the – I mean sendthis report directly to this email.  She gave me the email which was the correct one.  I therefore …    For Mr Ntshanga yes.  I then sent that report to Mr Ntshanga.  I must indicate that Mr Ntshanga had four email addresses within SA Express.There was inatintshanga@flyexpress.  There was intshanga@flyexpress.  There was ntshanga@flyexpress.  There was inati.ntshanga@flyexpress. So four email addresses.  So she directed me as to which one I should use.  I therefore sent that report to – to that email(intervenes).    That – that was – that was 8 November.    Yes, 2016.    Yes.    Yes.  In fact prior to that after sending that report I think on 12 December the GMHC - and I think Iomitted that information on this – followed up pertaining the investigation where she asked me as to how far are you with the investigation and I said to her as far as I am concerned I completed the investigation and I since delivered the report to the CEO with the recommendations and you can touch base with him to establish the facts and I guess she went back to him because she did not come back to me.    That is exactly the one.   That is – that is exactly the one Chair.    Okay.    As …    As I have stated Chair to say we had grounds to deal with Mr van Wyk …    Who was the subject – you know – subject of the …    Yes the matter.  Now in that regard Mr van Wyk part – in actual fact I had …    It was completed in that regard …    But because of there were other parties …    Involved …   That I could not – you know …    Expose or …    Yes, in that regard then …    I felt that it was proper of me to submit it as a preliminary investigation …    Yes.   Absolutely Chair.    Absolutely.  Not that I am investigating those parties but the third party investigating …    As per the recommendation in the …   Preliminary.    Absolutely because of …    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay, okay (intervenes).    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.   Correct.    The greater ambit ma’am.    No Chair.  There was a letter that he submitted but at that time I was not privy to the letter.  I heard this from the CEO himself, Mr Ntshanga.    Yes.      Chair after he disappeared on the 1 s t, on the 6 t h there’s a communication platform within S A Express called Corporatecomms, it was pronounced that or announced on the Corporatecomms to say he has been suspended effective the 1 s t of July.  Yet the 1 s t of July he disappeared, probably you know they metsomewhere and he was suspended.  Then later on he told me about his resignation and that he was not really you know satisfied ...(intervention)       The CEO, the CEO told me, Mr Ntshanga, that you know he had resigned and ...(intervention)       I saw it later on.      I saw it later on yes.     It was dated August 2016, no specific date to say on the 6 t h or whatever it says 2016 -  I mean August 2016.     The?       No that’s not my colleague actually, that’s Mr Brian van Wyk’s colleague so it was the GM, you know …(intervention).      Yes.     Mrs Gatiele Tlatsana.      Okay I recall Chair at some stage, because it wasn’t clear at the time whether he resigned or whatsoever, way after, you know, he disappeared and I kept asking theCEO and at some stage I also asked here, because at some state, you know they were sending me from pillar to post to say when are we going to execute the disciplinary that was prior the resignation and the CEO said no, Mrs Tlatsana must action that and I said but Mrs Tlatsana, you know, they’re equals and you actually the person that’s supposed to …(intervention).      Ja absolutely yes and to discipline, they said no speak to her and I went to her and she sent me back to Mr Ntshanga so there was this game that was actually played and I recall at some stage trying to find Mr Ntshanga, I think it was around the time when – just after Mr van Wyk disappeared, I cannot recall but I think around that time and I could not find him and he told me, that you know what he was not around, he did not pick up actually my calls.     Mr Ntshanga yes and you know because I already suspected, I remember going to the (indistinct), the CCTV room within SAA and review the footage backwards and I…(intervention).      After Mr van Wyk disappeared because there was something that we spoke about with the CE and I was actually following up and he avoided my calls and eventually when I got hold of him he said he was gone, he was not in the premises atthe moment – sorry on that particular day and I recall going back because I lacked trust on him, honestly at that juncture and I went to the CCTV room to review the footage on that day just to check on his movement and I realised at the time when I called him he was actually at the office of the GMHR on that day and he was within the premises, so he actually avoided my calls.  So I guess to a certain extent I was a pain to quite a number of people around that time.      16?      Okay, sorry about that.      Chair the conversation that I had with him at that juncture it was about the damage control of the relationship between SA Express and the North West Government.  Mr Ntshanga was not even talking about my report and recommendation, instead what he was concerned about was me writing or rather giving him a write up, you know that would say the relationship between SA Express and the North West can still go on because we are in charge,you know, we’re taking charge of all the other issues, you know, driving me to rectify  all the, you know, the wrongs that actually happened and I said to Mr Ntshanga, Mr Ntshanga that’s not my responsibility, you as the CEO you have to write that and hand it over to the North West, that is not my responsibility.  My responsibility is to provide the investigation reports as I actually investigated the matter in this regard and you know, when I responded like that, he said to me, you know, there’s one thing that I don’t understand with you, you ‘re conducting investigations as if you’re investigating for Koreneka and all I want from you is a write up and stop telling me stories and all that and he left me, we parted ways and he said you make sure that you submit the write up and I went back to my office, I thought about it to say, but what is this, what is it exactly that is expected of me because I’ve played my part and all that.  I then figured out to say, you know what, here, maybe I will lose my job but as far as this whole thing is concerned, he doesn’thave any grounds, therefore I’ll stand my ground.  I’m going to write a final investigation report which will be similar to the preliminary investigation report, the difference would be that, you know the prelim most of the stuff were in bullet point format.  Now I changed that to paragraphs where I elaborated as to how I went about the investigation and on top I wrote it, final investigation report, with the exact same date that was on the preliminary report, 6 October and then I handed that – I did not sign it for a simple reason, that was deliberate because I had confirmed to him  that I cannot compile a final investigation report because of – the investigation was not actually concluded, you know, inrelation to other parties that were involved, I therefore handed the exact same report, and I think it was around February at the time, I gave him that report which reminds me of something to say – there’s something that I actually omitted Chair, pardon me.      The whole evidence – I just want to indicate a part that was also played by GM Legal Risk and Compliance.      Chair Mr Inati Ntshanga the last time I played the clip and provide any piece of evidence to him it was on that meeting when I showed them the documents and all that but later on the GM Legal and Compliance requested that evidence to say, I need to go through that, and if my memory serves me well, it was around October/November I cannot recall clearly as to the specificdate.  She requested that file, I gave the file because I sealed that file and I just not keep it within the premises I kept it somewhere, when she requested, I said, no I’ll bring it, you know the following day to you.  I brought the file to her it was in a brown envelope and you know, it was properly sealed with a sellotape, a clear sellotape and the audio recordings were outside that file that brown envelope but they were in a smaller envelope also sealed properly, you know, placed on top of that documentary evidence.  I gave those to her, she went and looked at that, I think she kept those documents for almost two weeks with her, then later on she called me to say, no I’m done you can come pick upthose documents and I went and picked it up from her she gave it to me, that envelope and I left.  When I got to my office you know, instead of placing this in a drawer whatsoever I checked to say okay is everything still in tact.  I cannot say anything in relation to the documents, I cannot confirm if there was any document taken out of that bundle of whatsoever and I’m not implying that she did that, but the audio recording were not there, they were missing.      All of the audio recordings were not there, they were missing.      No, no I don’t know what was with me but I guess I was comfortable because I knew I could obtain copies from Ms Tlatsana.  So I went back to her and I said, ma’am all your recordings are not part of this now, you did not give back shesaid, no I didn’t, oh I thought they were there, you know and when you speak to a person you look at them, the gestures, the responses, if there’s something suspicious to say they know that they did not give this, she said, no okay I’ll look at my house, just like that, I said, no okay fine and later on in the week she came back to say no Tim I could not find those recordings, so I had to go back to Ms Tlatsana you know to request the copy of the recordings and she personally brought those recordings to our premises, you know she stood at the visitors parking and she called me, I went, she gave me and she gave me more than what she gave me initially, you know because there were otherconversations with other individuals on there, that’s how I actually obtained those recordings again.      No, no, no, those are separate.      In actual fact the recording that were added it was between the HOD Mr Bailey Mahlakoleng, Ms Tlatsana of which on the initial recordings that was not part of it and some other recording yes.      Yes.      And more yes.     Yes.      I did.      Correct.      That’s correct.      That’s correct.      Nope.      It’s the Department ofCommunity Safety and Transport Management and South African Express Airways.       South African Express Airways and Koreneka Event Managers – Koreneka Trading and Projects.      Correct.     Correct.    I tried Chair but I did not get evidence to that effect.  In …    I did.    He said they were notified bythe North West to say they erroneously deposited the money but …    It appears so.    So he did not provide any proof.    That is correct.    It is South African Express Airways and Valoteck Facilities Management.    It is South African Express Airways and Halcogen which is PAMCO.    It is South African Express Airways and Mohican Airport Management Company – MAMCO.    Mr Ngwenya.    I …    We heard about this way after the departure of Mr Ntshanga from SA Express but they were concluded within his last three or two days before he exited SA Express … Which is the 28 t h, 29 March 2017.    Correct.    That is correct.    Yes.    The following month.    Which is March 2017.    It was definitely at the end of the month.    March 2017.   That is correct.    That is correct.    Ja.    According to the information and the document that she handed to me …    Prior to Mr van Wyk bringing the two partners …    She was the sole owner of the company …    And after Mr Victor Thabeng resigned and she had to take out Ms Joyce Phiri out of the company.  She remained alone again.    Yes.    That is correct.    Yes I did establish ma’am.    Chair Ms Phiri is the mother to Mr Levy Sipho Phiri and Mr Levy Sipho Phiri is the life partner of Mr Brian van Wyk – boyfriend yes.    There is a personal relationship.  They are in – yes – romantic relationship.    Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    Ms Dube featured there as the owner or 50 percent shareholding and the …    Of Valoteck …    And Chair just to mention for the purpose of this hearing.The other owner of Valoteck Ms Kefilwe Mogodiri is also related to Ms Phiri because of Ms Phiri’s maiden name is Mogodiri as well.  So I guess Mr van Wyk wanted to keep it in the family.    It was confirmed.  I was told that it is …    Yes.    Correct.    That is correct.    Honestly speaking I did notactually investigate that because I had actually concluded and it happened when – you know we discovered after Mr Ntshanga left but what I have established in the ownership of PAMCO was that Ms Notule Dudu was also an owner of PAMCO.    That is correct.    Absolutely.    Not really ma’am.  As I have said that I did not (intervenes).    Page 25.    Ja.    That is correct.    That is correct.      2016.    At that time I was still running with this investigation.  I had not yet concluded or …    Okay Chair.  I am saying at that time I was still – you know – running with the investigation and all that and on that particular day I received a call as …    Yes and I hope my memory serves me well on the day but anyway I have indicated to say the – theitemised billing can be – you know – retrieved to actually …    Yes.    On that day Chair I received a call.  Now I have got caller ID on my phone.  So even if I do not have your number for as long as it is Rica’d it will reflect as who you are.  Now on that particular day I received a call from my counterpart at Absa which is the Head of Security – Mr Jason Tshabalala – who happened to be the former bodyguard of the late President Mr Nelson Mandela. He gave me a call and at that time when – when he called in that period I was dealing with quite a number of investigations and we had suspended a lady who was working for SA Express and during that time the lady alleged that Mr Tshabalala was actually the cousin.  Inactual fact she tried to influence me to turn a blind eye on that particular investigation. She went on to mention that I must not worry with the footage if it is available.  Mr Tshabalala was he cousin and he could assist – you know – to erase the movement and all that.  So when i received this call …    Okay.    I am saying …    Yes.    Now my thinking when I saw that it was Mr Jason Tshabalala who was calling my mind – in my mind I thought he was to ask me about the lady - Ms Suzeka Lokwe – who was suspended at the time.  I thought he was going to ask me about her – you know – talk about her because before we suspended her there was a matter that I was investigating and - you know – she mentioned that Mr Jason Tshabalala – because of that part spoke to her movement – you know – to the airport and all that and I indicated to say there is a footage movement and all that. So she persuaded me to turn a blind eye and she thenmentioned to me that Mr Jason Tshabalala the Head of Security was her cousin.  So according to her Mr Tshabalala was going to make the footage disappear.  That was according to her.  Now when I received the call and …    No it is something else.    Hence I am saying it is another thing.  So it was my (intervenes).    Yes.    Hm.    It was a separate case.  It was not …    I am just trying to relay the story …    Of my thinking.    So I thought he was to talkabout that because of what she told me but that was not the case.  Mr Tshabalala in fact said to me – he greeted me nicely.  Tim how are you?  I said no I am okay and he said to me there is a guy who wants to talk to you chief. You know – I said talk to me about what.  He said no man.  He just wants to talk to you.  I said who is this person.  He said no he is a brother man.  I mean you can – you know – chat to the guy.  I can …    l knew Mr Tshabalala …   But we are not close.    We are in the very same space …    And the last time I spoke to him it was – way back.  Approximately 2013/ 14 when I was – I was still working for previous company.    Yes.  It was then about a certain investigation anyone.  So it is not a person who we – you know – now when he called me that also was like – Jason calling me.  Where did he get – get my number and all that.  So he told me know this person is a brother and casually so – you know – and – and honestly speaking hewas nice. He is a nice guy.  Ja, he wants to talk to you.  I said okay but who is this guy.  I said no do not worry.  He is a brother.  He wants just to talk to you.  I said okay fine.  Not a problem.  You can give him my number but I got worried somehow to say I mean he did not speak about what I thought he would raise.  What is going on here? Could it be about this North West issue?  Well I did not know at the time.  Approximately 30 - 20 minutes or so later I received a call from an unknown person and this person indicated to me that I got your number form Mr Jason Tshabalala.  I would like to meet you around theMidrand area this afternoon.  In actual fact when I know off – you know – from work- around five.    No I could not.  I could not tell.    I could not – it showed the number.  It did not show the name.    Yes.  It showed the number.  It did not show the name and I said to - to this person chief I do not know you in the first place and you want to meet with me in Midrand.  You do not even greet me.  I felt that he – he was rude actually - you know.  You are telling me that you got my number from somebody and the next thing you want to – you want to meet with me.I do not know you and all that.  He said to me no I need to talk to you Chief.  I have got a mandate.  I need to – to talk to you.  I said Chief what- what mandate are you talking about.  He said no I have got a mandate from Lithuli House.  I just want to talk to you.  Can we meet?  I said I cannot meet you in Midrand. I can meet you in the airport precinct or in the East Rand mall towards my way home because I am a (indistinct) boy.  I stay in the (indistinct).  Therefore I cannot be driving to Midrand and all that and you want to talk to me therefore you have to sort of come to me.  He said okay fine.No it is fine I can meet you.  I said where can we meet.  He said no I will let you know.  I am in Cape Town right now but as soon as I get to the airport I would tell you exactly where we can meet.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct ma’am.  That is correct.    Yes.    Absolutely.    That – that – that is correct ma’am.  That is exactly what I said and that is what he told me.    Yes.    That is correct ma’am.  There is no way that you can fly from Cape Town to Johannesburg and beoutside a terminal building within a period of one hour 30 minutes.  It is impossible.    So …    He was actually – absolutely.  He was at the terminal building and the story that he was in Cape Town clearly it is not true.  There is no way there is no way.  I think that is - that is the part that I had actually exposed him to me that he was notreally telling the truth because I mean I am working in that space.  I know the duration …    And all that of the flights and all that.    (Intervenes).    Absolutely.  That is where he told me that he would be waiting for me.    That is – that is correct.  That iscorrect.    When – as I went to the Intercontinental – at that juncture I must say I was a bit worried and - you know – I thought that you know what I need to play smart – smart and safe – you know – in approaching this whole thing.  So I moved from the airways part towards the airport but there is – there is an entrance to the air side where workers – you know - only workers – you know – are actually entering the air side.I went to that air side – you know – just to be safe to walk within the air side – you know – towards the Intercontinental. Obviously I would get into the terminal building and go out through the terminal building but while I was walking there because he had already given me the description and the location. I phoned my associate as - I mean - I am in the security sector so I phoned my associate to say guys I have got a situation.  I need to cover for me because in this regard I think this may be an ambush of some sort.  I really do not trust.  Can you kindly establish as to whether this person is there and – you know – and the guys as I walking. It took me some time.  As I was walking they went and checked and they called me as I got onto the terminal building or approaching the terminal building.  They informed me to say – you know – yes the person is sitting there in the foyer but there were twoguys who were standing – you know – right next to him.  Just a few metres away from him and it appears that they are – you know – together with this guy.  So be weary of that. Now as I came and obviously they – they were watching because of – I was not really – I felt that – you know – I cannot really compromise my safety just like that.  So as I – I came in I phoned the guy while I was inside the building – the terminal building – but I could see him through the glass to say hey chief I am here. Where are you and I could see when he picked up the phone and when I looked on the side I saw the two guys.  Then I went throughbut I was wearing – you know – a coat with that cap – you know – trying to disguise in a way.  You know – so that if walking from airways park to the gate if there is someone perhaps who is waiting for me there to do something they may not be able to sort of recognise me. So I went to him and he was sitting there.  I greeted him.  He greeted me back and he said – I think his name if I am correct – I think he was Sipho.  He mentioned – I think - a surname but I cannot just recall the surname.  Then we sat and he said to me chief I am from Luthuli House and I have been given a mandate to talk to you pertaining your investigation in the North West and I said to him Luthuli House. What do I have to do with the – the mandates from Luthuli House because I am not a politician?  I am not interested in politics.  He said no it is about this investigation that you conducting.  Listen chief the money that is siphoned – you know – the Express the moneythat is in question here …    That is in August 2016.    July yes.    Yes.    Yes.    This is a person that I did not know.  I did not meet this person – you know – even previously.  So he said to me he was given this mandate because of the money that was involved.  The money that was taken out – you know – siphoned from this – was meant to – to finance the political activities of the ANC. I said chief that has absolutely nothing to do with me.  My concern here is Mr Brian van Wyk who manipulated the system and transgressed.  My focus is on everything that happened within SA Express.  As to who else is involved out of SA Express that has absolutely nothing to do with me and I do not want to know anything about it.  He said chief come on.  We need you to talk this.  Do you know how Mr Brian van Wyk got this surname?  I said (intervenes).    The money that was in question it is all about the R31 million.    Ja.    Now he is saying I must drop the investigation.    I must drop the investigation …    Because the money involved was to fund the political activities of the ANC and I said I am not a politician.  I have nothing to do with that and as far as this whole thing is concerned Mr Brian van Wyk manipulated the system and he transgressed. My concern was Mr Brian van Wyk because of – you know – he was working for SA Express and anything out of SA Express was actually none of my business and I was not interested because I am not a politician.  I do not even intend to become one.  So …    yes.    Yes.   Come again ma’am.    Absolutely ma’am, absolutely.    To say – to be – to be precise.  He said the money that was moved out of North West.    Campaigns, exactly yes.     Yes.      Okay siphoned it is my own word.      Siphon is my own word.      Yes, yes.        The money that was moved from the Northwest yes, yes.    No I didn’t have any doubt ma’am for the simple reason that he spoke about Mr van Wyk and Mr van Wyk was involved in the R31million.     He had a mandate from the Lutuli House to talk to me pertaining the investigation that I’m running against Mr Brian van Wyk which involved the money that was moved from the Northwest and that money was used to finance the ANC political campaigns you know those activities, so in a way he was saying this was not Mr Brian van Wyk’s money, it was actually the ANC’s money.      Yes.      Yes Chair, I was about to get to that part as well.  The intention of talking to me at that juncture he said this money was to fund that, and then he said Mr Brian van Wyk inactual fact was actually that’s my interpretation he was the vehicle to get the money out and channel it towards those activities of the ANC, because he even went on to say you know how he obtained the surname van Wyk, because he is very dark you know, and I said I don’t want to know, he then said to me we can offer you R3million to drop this investigation.  My response to him was that S A Express was paying me adequately, therefore I need not take any money from anyone.  He tried to persuade me and I told him straight that I wasn’t really interested.  Now he moved from that subject to talk about the R20million that was still you know in the Koreneke account and at that time Mr Gully Sillira[?] and Mr Brian van Wyk they had no access to that money because Ms Tlatsana moved that money to another account because of when the conflict started between them later on there was a deposit of R20million from the Northwest, so she moved that money so they could not have access preventing them to that access.     Yes.      Yes.    Absolutely, absolutely.      Yes.     That is correct ma’am, that is correct.      Absolutely.     That is correct ma’am.      Yes.     He said on the R20million that there’s a R20million of course that was within the Koreneka contract and it was clear that they did not have access to it.  He said to me he understands that I have got a better understanding with Ms Tlatsana so I needed to persuade her to let go of the money, release the money or she must move out of the airport, you know to leave that space, and my response to him was that I have nothing to do, I am not part of Koreneka and I cannot entertain such, I don’t have even the mandate to deal with such, I blatantly refused you know to entertain those issues, so he said to me I mean think about it chief, you know the R3million, I said listen chief I do my job without fear, favour or prejudice and my mandate has nothing to do with the political dealings and getting involved in other companies affairs, so I am not interested.  He saysyou must think about it, I said to him even if I can think about it the answer would remain the same, no.  And we ended up parting ways, he left and I left.     You know Chair to be quite honest with you as I arrived they were there, but at the time when we were talking I had actually forgotten about them.  My mind shifted, I didnot ...(intervention)      I did not think about them but yes.    Yes.  On that week, it wasaround the 23 r d or 25 t h you know of August and I was with Ms Mochoele and Mr Ntshanga, it was in his office actually where I think Mr Ntshanga actually asked as to how did my meeting and the guy that I met from Lutuli House went because Ms Mochoele informed him that I was meeting some guys and all that, because I did not talk to him about you know me meeting the guy, so I informed Ms Mochoele, so Ms Mochoele told him that I met the guy,  so he was asking as to how it went and I narrated the story as to what transpired what was the guy you know what exactly did he want from me and all that, and I indicated that you know the connection between me and the guy was created byMr Jason Tshabalala who is the head of security at ACSA, and Mr Ntshanga’s reaction was that Jason Tshabalala who is t his Jason Tshabalala, and I explained to him that he is the head of security at ACSA.  He said I don’t know the guy, oh  you don’t know the guy, ja, I don’t know the guy, who is that, and you know while I was trying to explain we ended up talking about the movie Invictors, you know the Invictors the rugby, and Madiba in that movie where Mr Jason Tshabalala and Mr Linga Motsane from S A Express is the bodyguard of the President they were played by Tony Kgoroge and Patrick Mofokeng so we spoke about that you know where he presented as if he didn’t know, but little did he know that I was aware that they were quite close because I have seen them before you know seen together, within the airport precinct, so he pretended as if he didn’t know, but later on he made a mistake by saying hey Jason anyway he lost his father and you know I could not attend the funeral because I engagements, and so thatnullified everything that he said before you know that he didn’t know this guy, pretending as if he didn’t know him, so it was all about that, but to a certain extent it gave a different picture to me you know about him.    I’m not sure Chair but there’s plenty cameras around that space, so whether area is covered I am notreally sure but also it’s not going to be possible to retrieve those records because of the ...(intervention)     Because of the timeline yes.    It all depends sir and in most cases the footage that if we request (inaudible) yes and ...(intervention)     Come again sir?    No you can only retrieve 30days back.    Dating back to 30 days.    And some of – yes because of I viewed the footage and got plenty of investigation that I conduct that – where we also retrieved the footage and all of that, so I am certain around that.    Chair I did not think of it however when I received the call before I went and met the guy, because of 30 minutes after I was called by Mr Tshabalala 30 minutes later I received a call from this guy and he told me that he will tell me about his location at the airport.  I started to think as to who might have you now gave Mr Tshabalala my contact and the person that I thought about at the time was Mr Linga Moonsamy who is the head of security at SAA and we were very close, and I figured out that both the body bodyguard of the late president, Nelson Mandela, therefore I decided to go straight to Mr Linga Moonsamy to ask if he had given Mr Tshabalala my contact and he agreed, he confirmed to say ja no he called me and he requested you contact, I gave the contact to him.  I said to him you know there’s a problem, this is the situation, there’s aguy that called me and because of Jason created you know the platform for the guy to have access to me and you gave the number, he said what is this all about, I said no I don’t know but there is a matter that I am busy with which I think to a certain extent you might have a bit of a knowledge and he was really concerned to say you know what I gave the number to Jason because I thought we are in the very same security you know – what’s the word that I want to us.    Sector absolutely yes, that we are all in the security sector.   Absolutely.    Absolutely sir.    At the time when I asked him he did not disclose the guy’s name, he said it’s a brother that wants to talk to you he didn’t even say as to what was the subject.    Yes.    To date I haven’t spoken to him.    I did not talk to him to date, sometimes we meet in these workshops you know, but we’re not close.  He is the one ...(intervention)     I suppose so, I didn’t have his number Chair at that particular juncture however I went back to sort hiscontact which I think is the very same number that  he used, and I gave to the Commission’s investigation for the purpose of retrieving the itemised billing to reflect the connection between the guy, myself and him.    Thank you Chair. 
NGWENYA:The boss of security management so to speak.  So I delivered the news to her to say this is what I have but I would also want to see it to be part of this, pleasejust get this, she left my office and she went, at that time the CEO was already you know at work.  She spoke to the CE, advised her to say hey there’s this thing that is happening and Tim wants to see us and all that.  Now the CE excused himself from the Exco meeting of which the GM Legal did say, so we went and sat in the CE’s office, excuse me – in the CEO’s office, Mr Inati Ntshanga and when we got there I actually explained to them you know as to why I wanted to see them, I told them that I received a call on Friday from a person who is based you know in the Northwest and this person alleged that Mr Brian van Wyk was corrupt and in a way he was trying to take over her company and thatperson is actually the owner of the company Koreneka which is the ground service provider for S A Express in the Northwest Airports and I said to them I had requested this person not to go to the media, because she wanted to report this and I also promised her that I would ensure that the CE gives her a call so as to confirm that the matter was reported to the highest office within the organisation as promised.So when I got there I explained all that to say I’ve got the audio recordings, you know this – I actually had the evidence with me and these audio recordings, I explained the audio recordings to say some of those were recorded over you know the telecon between Mr van Wyk and Ms Tlatsana and other officials from the Northwest, you know and also there was one that I focused specifically on because it touched on the S A Express individual where it implicated the CE – I told him straight to say it implicated, Mr van Wyk actually implicated you on that particular recording and the Board Chairperson Mr Motema,and that ...(intervention)   Okay, apart from the Chairperson and the CEO of S A Express the other individuals that were implicated was the then Minister of the DPE, Lynne Brown, and the then Minister of Department of Transport, Minister Dipua Peters, the Premier of the Northwest, Mr Supra Mahumapelo, the HOD of the Northwest which I assume that was Mr Bailey Mahlakoleng and the CFO of which I don’t know the name it was not mentioned as to who the person was,the MEC from the Northwest and a Mr Wolmarans whom she alleged that was more like a right hand man of the Premier.  Those were the individuals that were implicated. 
ADV KATE HOFMYR:  When did that – sorry – and what was hisresponse to that? 
MR TIMOTHY NHLANLA NGWENYA:  Because if I was to submit - submit it as a final investigation report that would close everything that is limited to this.  So yet I wanted continuity. 
MR NHLANHLA NGWENYA:  That’s correct, yeah.    It was the Airport refurbishment and compliance maintenance and operational setup cost.    Look Chair, this description you know had nothing to do with SA Express sort of responsibility.    Yes, the agreement between SA Express and Koreneka because of none of the services mentioned there youknow SA Express requested that Koreneka provide but this they’re related to the Facility Management agreement where Koreneka was acting as the management company providing services to the Northwest Department of Transport in managing the Airports.  This has absolutely nothing to do with SA Express.    That’s correct.    That’s correct, Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    At Airport refurbishment?   Compliance maintenance.    Chair, this information is also contained on the audio recordings where Mr Brian van Wyk was actually you know describing the type of service to Ms Babadi Tlatsana, it’s on record.    Where he mentioned to say they need to refurbish the Airport, they need to put on the CCTV, the fire trucks and all that.   I assumed.    Because if I knew for a fact that it was not part of the agreement between SA Express and Koreneka.    That is correct.    Yes, that’s correct.    Correct.    Yes.    Airport refurbishment and compliance maintenance and facility upgrade.    That’s correct.    Correct.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.   Facility Security Management and FacilityManagement.    Airport fire truck lease.    That’s correct.    As I’ve explained earlier ma’am, to say you know there is a delegation of authority in terms of signing off the money and all that.  Now on the expense of it is clearly depicted as to how much can the CEO and the GM sign off?  Now anything above 10 million because of I think he’s got the signing power for 10 million rand.  Now at that time you know its 14 million that was supposed to be takenout of the account.  Now the CEO didn’t have lead delegation of authority you know in terms of (inaudible crosstalk) of authority to say he can sign for anything above the 10 million rand.    In that regard the Board was supposed to be involved in this so as to approve and sign it off.  But the amounts were broken into two smaller amounts which were below the 10 million threshold so that you know to circumvent the ... (intervenes)    The need to approach the Board and theirapproval.  And I must say that the Board was never even informed of this transaction as the money was flowing out of the company.  So the separation was just to ensure that it’s below the 10 million threshold and that obviously it enables Mr van Wyk the authority to sign it off and ja.    Okay, let me put it this way Chair.  On all these transactions the CEO appended his signature on the ... (intervenes)    Expense authorisation form.    Now Mr van Wyk was approving so heendorsed you know the CEO, he also signed on that on all these expense forms.    Yes.      He had knowledge because of earlier he informed me that this money was deposited to SA Express by mistake you know, it was not intended for SA Express.  It was intended for Koreneka hence they were taking that money out of SA Express.    Tab 13.    It’s Mr Brian van Wyk signature.    That’s correct, Mr Brian van Wyk, its Brian Tebogo van Wyk.    That’s correct.    Absolutely.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.    That’s correct, Chair.    That’s correct.    That’s correct, yeah.  That’s correct.    She did not submit any invoice.    And for that matter Chair, she did not even know how to prepare an invoice at the juncture.    She told me.  At some stage she asks me as to how to submit an invoice, how to go about.    Absolutely.    Absolutely and obviously the recordings also it is actually mentioned that Mr David Kalisilira was responsible for you know preparing invoices and all that.  And that came out of Mr Brian van Wyk’s mouth that was his exact words.    That’s correct.    His response was that the money was erroneously paid to SA Express when it was intended for Koreneka so based on that they had to pay it to Koreneka.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.    That’s correct, Chair.    That was my view Chair, to say it’s unlawful to divert money that is transferred to your account erroneously.  It was not intended for Express therefore why divert it instead of advising the Northwest Department because of you got a relationship to them to say you know sort of reverse the payment and redirect it to the intended entity.    That’s exactly my point that those are issues that are raised with the CE Chair.    Because of I was concerned about that.    Correct.
