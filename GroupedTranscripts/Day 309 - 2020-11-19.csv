CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody. After hearing argument on Monday I indicated that I would give my ruling on Tuesday but we had to extend or postpone until this morning.  I am now ready to give the ruling. The actual full typed ruling/judgment will be available later today because there are some further corrections to be made.  But this is the ruling. R U L I N G This is an application brought by Mr Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma for my recusal as Chairperson of this commission or for my recusal from hearing any evidence that may be given by him or any member of family in this commission. Mr Zuma to whom I shall I refer in this ruling/judgment as the Applicant is a former President of the Republic of South Africa. On 22 October 2020 the Applicant was served with a summons issued and signed by the Secretary of the Commission requiring or compelling him to appear before the commission at ten o’clock on 16 – 20 November 2020 for the purpose of giving evidence and being questioned by an evidence leader in the commission. The scope of his evidence was to cover about 35 affidavits or so of certain witnesses who have already testified before the commission.   On Wednesday 11 November 2020 the application lodged with the commission an application for my recusal.  The application was set down for hearing before me.  It was opposed by the server of the commission who delivered an answering it – an answering affidavit during the weekend of the 14 November 2020. A replying affidavit by the Applicant was delivered in the evening on Sunday the 15 November 2020.  Under circumstances that will be apparent from this judgment or ruling later I read a certain statement into the record at the commencement of the proceedings on Monday 16 November 2020. A copy thereof was given to the Applicant’s attorneys as well as the commission’s legal team.  Subsequently the Applicant delivered another affidavit on Wednesday 18 November 2020.   I have heard oral argument from Counsel for the Applicant Mr Skihakhane SC who was assisted by Mr T Masuku SC as well as argument from Mr P J Pretorius SC the head of the commission’s legal team. Before I proceed it is necessary to set out the background to this application.  It is not necessary to set out that background in any great detail because the establishment of this commission is well-known. It suffices to point out that in accordance with its name this commission was established to investigate and report on allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector including organs of state. It was established by the Applicant in January 2018 when he was still the President of the country.  He did so pursuant to an order of the High Court Pretoria which gave effect to the then Public Protector ’s Remedial Action. In accordance with the Public Protector ’s Remedial Action and the order of the High Court Pretoria I was selected by the Chief Justice and appointed by the Applicant as the then President of the Republic as the Judge who would chair this commission. My appointment was announced by the Applicant in January 2018.  I am the sole member of the commission.  The commission has a secretary who heads the secretariat of the commission.  It also has its legal team as well as the investigation team. The legal team consists of a number of practicing attorneys and advocates.  The investigation team consists of various investigators. Part of the Terms of Reference of this commission which were approved by the Applicant when he was still President include apart from the Provision that the commission must investigate allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector including organs of state. They include that the commission must investigate and report on whether and to what extent and by whom attempts were made through any form of inducement or for any gain of whatsoever nature to influence members of the National Executive [including Deputy Ministers, Office Bearers and of Functionaries employed by or Office Bearers of any state institution or organ of state or directors of the boards of SOE’s].   In particular the commission must investigate the veracity of allegations that former Deputy Minister of Finance Mr Ncebisi Jonas and Ms Mentoor were offered Cabinet positions by the Gupta family. 1.2  Whether the President had any role in the alleged offers of Cabinet positions to Mr Ncebisi Jonas and Ms Mentoor by the Gupta family as alleged. 1.3   Whether the appointment of any member of the National Executive Functionary and or Officer Bearer was disclosed to the Gupta family or any other unauthorised person before such appointments were formally made and or announced and if so whether the President or any member of the National Executive is responsible for such conduct. 1.4  Whether the President or any member of the President or previous members of his National Executive [including Deputy Ministers or public official or employee of any state owned entity] breached or violated the constitution or any     Yes, Mr Pretorius.     Okay alright.  Mr Sikhakhane.     Yes.     Yes.   Yes. Well, I guess he should ...[intervenes]      He should carry on with his plans.     Yes.     Ja.       Okay alright.       Yes.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.      H’m.     Okay.  Mr Pretorius.     Well, let us take the tea adjournment and then we will resume after 15-minutes.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     We took a tea adjournment which has ended up taking quite long.  We return to the hearing in circumstances where Mr Zuma has left, I have been told.  Mr Zuma had been issued with a summons to be here from Monday to tomorrow unless he was excused by me.  On Tuesday his lawyers asked me to excuse him for yesterday because he wanted to attend a funeral.  I excused him from attending.  He has left today without asking me to be excused.   This is a serious matter but in terms of the plans of the Commission for this week he was going to be, if I dismissed his application that I should recuse myself, as I have done, he was going to be asked to take the witness stand and be questioned about various matters relating to matters that we are investigating as a Commission.  It is a pity that he has elected to leave without asking for permission.   There is no point for the Commission to sit for the rest of the day because it has convened to deal with his evidence, there is no point in coming tomorrow because he is not coming back.   So we are going to adjourn and the Commission will reflect on the matters that it needs to reflect on but it is going to continue with its work.  I think I am going to end there.  I do not know if there is anything you want to say Mr Pretorius?     Yes.     Yes.  Okay so we are going to adjourn, there will be no hearing tomorrow but next week there are witnesses who will come and we will continue next week on Monday.  We adjourn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, during the course of the week we have had various discussions both in chambers and during the course of address before you that indicated that the Applicant and his legal team would react in one way or another and perhaps we should find out what their attitude is.   We, as the legal team, do have in possession and we have prepared an argument on the eventuality of the result that has occurred but perhaps that should wait and we should hear my learned friend.     It seems that any attempt at [speaker not clear] is not well-accepted.  Our position is, the summons still stands and the Applicant, Mr Zuma, must now answer questions.  If that position is opposed, I will present argument to you on that basis.       Chair, we have prepared argument in writing to place before you.  The effect of that argument is that, notwithstanding an intention to review your decision, in short, the proceedings must continue.   And if, as my learned friend puts it, they are excusing themselves from the proceedings.  They are, in fact, acting...  Well, not they, the Applicant would be acting in defiance of the summons and unlawfully.   It is up to you Chair to decide whether or not the proceedings will continue or whether they will be adjourned or stayed, in effect, pending any application for review or any referral of any complaint Chair.   So the position is simply this.  The summons stands.  It is not, with respect to my learned friend, open to the Applicant simply to “excuse himself”.   The proper application of the law that demands that you make a decision about the continuance of proceedings.  And in that regard, we have prepared argument.   But in the face of a unilateral decision, I am not sure that it is going to be productive to take up time, presenting that argument to you.  So perhaps we should take a short adjournment and you can rule on the proceedings after the adjournment.     Thank you, Chair.     No, Chair.     Your address is noted. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE SC:   Chair, I am not entirely sure what Mr Pretorius is saying.  He says he will argue after me.  I am not entirely sure.  I have noted the judgement.     I really do not know what he says I must say before he argues something.  I am truly not – I am a bit baffled about what he says we must argue.     I really do not know what he wants me to do.     He wants to hear what I ...[intervenes]      I think he must carry on with his plans.     And I will say if his plans do not – are not aligned with mine.     Thank you.     Thank you, Chair.  I am clearer now about what it is we are debating.     Well, I have no position to put for us to debate.     One is that, before we excuse ourselves from the proceedings, I think I have a duty to tell the Chair why we will excuse ourselves so that it not cause a walk out or defiance but we will excuse ourselves right now.     The facts is this.  Is that the instruction is to review your decision that you have just of when you finally give us a copy and we will take it from there.     The next Chair is that.  You will realise – maybe I did not say this enough.  Is that you have become a judge in the dispute that involves yourself, in that, in determining disputes that arise in matters that include you.   And Chair, I know you have quoted Arthur Chaskalson, the CJ but you may not have noted that the issues in Arthur Chaskalson and Louis Luyt were common cause and the issues here are not common cause.   And for that reason Chair we want to excuse ourselves from these proceedings so that we consider your ruling.  And insofar as the issue of you becoming a judge in your own matter, which on its own is a ground that we have mentioned, that Mr Zuma mentioned.   I want to say that we have also been instructed to bring an application – not an application – to lodge a complaint about you in that regard to the Judicial Service Commission in respect of the issue about which you have made yourself a witness and a judge.   And therefore Chair, I have no other instruction today or anywhere in the future until we have considered the review except that we would like to be excused from these proceedings.  Thank you.
