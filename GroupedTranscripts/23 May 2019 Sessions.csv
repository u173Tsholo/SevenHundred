CHAIRPERSON:  Good Morning Ms Sello, good morning everybody.    Just one second Ms Sello.  Ms Zonica could you tell them to make sure that the chair that I normally use is here by – yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Okay no that is fine.    Thank you.  Okay.    Well the bottom line is you must still be able to giveyour evidence properly.  Okay.  So yes there is that factor but make sure that you are able to give you r evidence properly and do not – so do not be under too much pressure.     Do not feel under too much pressure.  Okay.  Just make sure that we – we – I hear everything that is important that you need to tell me.    Okay.    I think the last thing I said when we – just before we adjourned was that this morning he would need to recap on the last point he was making.    Before we adjourned.    So I think that is where we should start.     Hm.    Unfortunately I did not make point – I did not note the point that there was a point he was making which I had not understood or he might not have finished to deal with properly and that is why I said please when we resume – start from there refresh our memory because I had not heard it properly.  So I did not make a note what the point was.  Mr Callard do you remember what the point was?     Hm.    Yes, yes.    Thank you.  The page is 586 and the divider is?     Yes.   Okay.  Yes.    Ja no you may proceed.   That is where I was and you said sorry and then …     And then you…     Okay.    Okay, alright.    Hm.    What Annexure, w hat page?    Okay.  Try and just be consistent and use the number – page numbers at the top right hand corner.     The other numbers will confuse us.  Number 679.     At what page of the supplement ary?    Oh that is Exhibit BB4     [e].    [c]?    Okay.    Yes.   Yes.    Is that now 193 of what?     Paragraph 193 of your statement.    Okay.    Where you are able to do address the question of whether you think some of these things were done deliberately because for purposes of the Commission if certain things were not done right but it was just genuine mistakes it might not be important if you know what is important is when schemes are devised in order to achieve wrong objectives.  So just bear that in mind – you know.  They can make lots of mistakes and so on and that is not good but that maybe somebodyelse – else’s job to deal with in term - in terms of any competence and so on.  So our focus is really on things that may have been done deliberately or to deceiv e in order to achieve certain illegal objectives.     I accept that you might not always be able to – to say but I just want to remind you that where you are able to say that on a properly analysis of certain documents and the facts this must have been deliberately done for certain unacceptable objectives but where you are not able to say I know that you – you might not be able to say in all the cases.    Yes.    No, thank you.    Before you do that.    Can I just ask whether the 38 – the 38 billion do you move from the premise that that was in order itself before there was an increase or is that something you di d not look into?    No, I understand that.    Ja, but before you get there I just want to know whether even the 38 billion from where the amount moved up …     Whether you have done an exercise whether that would have been a reasonable price?     Ja.    You were comfortable with that?     Yes.    Okay.    Okay.  No that is – that is – that is fine.    Yes.    Yes and what was the period that had lapsed between the time when that was the price that was giv en and this 49 billion – over what period.  I just want to have an idea what may have changed during that interval.    Yes.    About a year later?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.   Okay, thank you.    And where are they?    Yes.    Oh you are still going to go …     To go there?    Okay, alright.    I am sorry.  You were told that …     You were not to have access to them?     Oh and who told that?    Oh you cannot remember but that is what you were told?    Oh.    Okay.  Yes, are you able to tell me?     Yes, the name.    Oh okay, okay.  That is the one who had asked you at some stage to work on some  memorandum or something?     Yes, ja.   Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.  So he said that you may not have access to thespreadsheets?    Ja and what was your reaction to that?     This is still at that time?     Oh.    Oh, okay alright.    Oh, okay ja, ja.  After the event?    Way after the event.    Yes, okay alright.    And who was the Chief Financial Officer at the time – 18, January?    Okay, alright.  So you got the spreadsheets?     Yes but before you approached the Chief Financial Officer what justification did Mr Laher give to you for saying you may not have access to the spreadsheets when you were part of the team?     Okay, alright.    You are not aware of what it was?    Yes.  Okay, thank you.    Yes.   Huh-uh.    Yes.            I want us to identify them so that …     We do not keep on talking about spreadsheets.     Whoever reads the transcripts where – where are they?    Well is it BB …    4B.    Not second bundle.    That wil confuse.  So okay.  Did you say Annexure 7?     Thank you.  Is there – I do not seem to have Annexure 77B.   I only have 77.    I think he said 77B.    Ja.    67.    Okay.    Alright.    Is that one of the spreadsheets?    Yes.    But – but are we done with the spreadsheet for diesel locomotives?       Okay what I thought you would do is first tell – say to us the spreadsheet for diesel locomotives is found from page so and so to page so and so if it’s more than one spreadsheet you say they are found – those for diesel locomotives are f ound from that to that and then we go to the ones for electric locomotives, is that convenient to you or is that inconvenient?        Okay it is there in the statement what – so that one – when one goes through the Annexures, maybe one can make a note so you can – so one can see them without going to the statement but one can find them, it’s okay it’s not a problem.      Yes.         Are you going to spreadsheets now?        What page again?       Before you do that Mr Callard please don’t f orget the point you wanted to say at some stage – I don’t want to forget this,at some stage tell me whether, after you had seen the contents of the spreadsheets, whether you were able to deuce what the reason was why Mr Leher said you should not have acce ss to it or that it was confidential, you don’t have to deal with it now if it’s not convenient, as long as at some stage you deal with it.        Okay.       Okay well I was  - I’m interested in hearing whether the conclusion you are able to make or the conclusion you are able to make is that the reason why he may have not w anted you to see the spreadsheets was some illegitimate reason because the spreadsheet would give you information that he didn’t want you to know.  So – but as I say you can deal with it later if that’s convenient but if you want to deal with it now it’s fine.       Is highly relevant.       I’m sorry, you wouldn’t know woul d you whether that you shouldn’t have access to these spreadsheets was simply MrLeher’s decision or whether he was just carrying out somebody else’s instruction that certain people mustn’t see – certain people including you, mustn’t see these spreadsheets ?       Okay thank you.       Well the first column would it not be the big one which doesn’t have best base price and then – or you’d say the first ofthe smaller columns?      Okay, alright.        Or first small column.       Yes.      Yes.      Oh are those columns as well I thought they were spaces (indistinct).        They are spaces (indistinct).   Where – where in those columns the currency is not written what must we take it to be?     Where – where the figures do not indicate the currency.  You see some of the figures you have got US Dollar and so on but other figures do not – some of the – and then you have got Euro and then others you do not have the currency.  Which currency should we be…    Right in rand?    Okay.    You did not forget the point you wanted to make about the arrow?    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    Yes okay.    I think – I think he has just dealt with it.     Yes.   It was back – it was the arrow at page 625.    Ja and he says where there is y ellow in the columns it means that those figures need a lot of scrutiny.     In depth interrogation and what we are doing is part of that exercise.    No no do not.    I think we understand each other.     But we do not want to leave you behind.     You – you said you make no assumption I thought you actually do make the assumption that they are correct?     Otherwise you cannot – you cannot do this exercise.    Yes but what you mean is you have not gone behind that to check if they are correct?     So you actually assume that they are correct?  You said you do not assume if they are correct. You said you make no assumption that they are correct.    Ja.    Yes so you assume that they are correct?     Or am I misunderstanding you?  If you have not checked whether they are correct you – but you work on the basis that they are correct we would say you assume that th ey are correct, is itnot or am I missing something in what you said?     Yes.    Yes.    Okay, yes, yes you make a conclusion on the basis ofthe figures as they are presented.     Whether they are correct or not you do not know but you – what you can justify if your conclusion?       Ja.    I think we understand each other Mr Callard.     And the white space in between Ms Sello.    Is that other than GE and CNR?     I am sorry first you said 2.11.1?     And then?    Oh.    Bottom to 2.11.   I am sorry turn over to?    Oh okay.    Okay but you – have you just made the point in regard to paragraph 2.11 that it is Mr Laher as the author of the two spreadsheets that we should tend to?     Yes.    Yes.  Is Mr Laher still with Transnet or is he[indistinct]?    He is still there?    Okay alright.      Okay.    Is he one of the witnesses coming or not?     Not in the list.    Yes.    Yes okay.    Okay alright.    Okay I am sorry I am trying to understand the reference to in good faith in the second line.     What you mean is the exercise in which yo u wereinvolved.    Was in good faith that exercise?     Yes.     Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Had not.  Yes, no, no that is fine.     Okay thank you.ADV MAHLAPE    Which is what you were trying to establish?     Yes.    And that is why you cannot understand why he did notshare the spreadsheets with you?     Hm.    Yes.    Just to remind me he was the one that – was he the one that asked that the exercise be done?     Yes.  And do you know whether they were aware of the existence of these spreadsheets at the time that you were asking to see the spreadsheets?    Yes.    Yes.    You mean even the Chief Financial Officer was not aware?    That is the impression you got?     Yes.    Yes just to go back to Ms  Sello’s question.  As I understand it I think what she wanted to find out but if – if he is not the one that asked that the – the exercise be done maybe that is …     The explanation to her question is …    Is that it was somebody else that asked that the question – the exercise be done but maybe to follow up on that question if Mr Laher understood the spreadsheets the way you understood them after you have had access to them then except for th e issue of confidentiality that I understand he raised then his response when he heard that this exercise was being done should have been – there is a spreadsheet that explains and share it with everybody.     So except for the fact that he might not have wantedyou and maybe the others to know about the spreadsheets that is what – that is the reaction one would have expected if he was aware of these and he understood the contents of the spreadsheets the way you  understand them.     Yes.    Yes, yes.    Do you know of any reason why Mr  Laher despite knowing of the existence of these spreadsheets he might not have understood the – the spreadsheets.  In other words – I mean - for example my question goes to if something really requires numbers if – if somebody is an accountant you would – he would know that or she would know that quite easily.  Therefore you can exclude lack ofunderstanding of those figures but if it is so mebody maybe that requires knowledge of numbers and they are not good at numbers you might say okay maybe he did have them but did not understand them.     So – so that explanation can be excluded that he might not have understood numbers here.  Okay, thank you.     Before you add it - and please do not forget the point - before you add it after you had had a chance to analyse the spreadsheets and realise d that Mr Laher must have known or knew …     That – you know – you were engaging in an exercise that really was not necessary.  Did you by any chance confront him and say why did you not tell us about this and w hy did you allow this exercise to happen because otherwise if – if he did not want you to know – to know the information in the spreadsheets he could have said well I know how the price has changed.  There is no need to do the exercise but I cannot share the information with you.  Maybe I will share it with whoever has a right to know about it.     My question is whether you were able at any stage toask him why – why do you waste our time.    That is fine, yes.    Because …    Yes.    As long as you deal with it.  That is fine ja.    Where are we going now?    7-0?   Yes.    To the extent that what you have been able to pick up here with regard to the increase of the price from 38 to 50, 49, 50, 54 to the extent that you have picked up figures that are inexplicable as far as you are concerned which may mean that Transnet was put at a risk.  Its interests were not properly looked after by people who weresupposed to pick these things up.  Who ultimately at Transnet should have picked up these things and who ultimately – when I say ultimately – it might be somebody quite high up.  There may be - but there may be others who below that body or that person should have picked these things up because part of their job was to check  these things and because if it was part of their job to check these things properly and pick these things up and they did not do that.  One within the context of what we are dealing with it maybe that for some it was gross negligence but for maybe others it maybe that it was much more.  It was not just negligence.  It was part of a scheme.  So – so it becomesimportant to – to pin down the people who may have been part of the scheme and may have put Transnet at risk by allowing and approving figures which should not have been approved because they were unjustified.    But the leader of the Negotiation Team was …?    Yes.    Who the other.    Ja, okay, okay.    Hm.   Okay, thank you.  Other than the Negotiation Team there would be somebody else probably who had to sign off to say this is fine who would not be in the Negotiation Team?     Yes, yes.    But in the end Mr Brian Molefe would have been the one to say whether a particular price was acceptable.  So in other words the Negotiation Team if they thought a price would be – is acceptable they would have to report to him?     And if he thought the price was not right then he would say no but if he thought it was right then he would – he would approve?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes, okay thank you.  May we take the tea adjournment and we will resume at half past 11?  We adjourn.      Yes, you may proceed Ms Sello.        I’m sorry from which paragraph Ms Sello did you start?      Okay.       Yes.       Yes, thank you.       I’ve got it.       774, 374 or 774?       Ja okay I think I heard 374 but maybe I didn’t hear correctly.       Okay.       Can one explain your concept of reverse engineering in this way, that you first decide what the final amount is or should be that you want to  achieve and then once you know what that amount is then you go back to the various components that make up the amounts and find one or more components that might be easy to play around with and therefore – and then increase one or more of those in order to achieve the result that you have already identified?       Okay alright thank you.       No, no that’s fine I was – I wanted to check whether I understood it correctly so that one could apply it to any other item if need arises to say what’s the general principle or explanation for it, okay.       But the starting point may well be people who put in the figures, if they can’t explain to say, what’s your explanation for this in the light of your ev idence.       And they may or may not be able to explain it but that’s one way or a component of finding out.       Yes okay.       So, it might be a good thing to have a notary as you say…(intervention).       Oh, see they both end with a “ary”.        No thank you, I meant actuary, notary is somebody else. One way is to bring in an actuary but it may well – I mean as Isee it even the actuary might just be able to explain how much it is – how much difficult it is to explain the jump from that figure to that figure but in the end,  one might just have to make an inference to a certain – in regard to a certain component the figures were inflated or something like that.       Ja I think that it goes to the question of whether  there’s a logical explanation or whether there’s – if it can be explained in any rational way that the jump and what might appear to be inconsistency and so on.       Ja okay, alright.    But we don’t need to go through that if we’ve already covered it, so only that which we might have left out.         Yes.      Is that Annexure 67?       Okay, yes.     Give us an estimate of around about when you think it was when you met him?  Mid -year, last year or later?     2018.    2018 ja.   Okay.     Did you – did he offer some explanation that you found impossible or he just kept quiet?    He was just?    Just plucking them from the tree or what?     Did he – did he – did you ask him and I do not know if I am repeating this question, did you ask him why did you say this was confidential this spreadsheet – these spreadsheets were confidential because this was information that in the exercise we were doing we needed to see?  What the basis was or foreseeing.  In other words did you ask him the basis for him saying these spreadsheets were confidential?    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    And you never heard why it was thought the spread sheets were confidential?     So even in other words even if you did not ask himyou did not by any chance hear from anybody what the basis may have been for – for him saying that it was confidential – they were confidential?    No.    Okay.    Yes.   Yes.  Well Ms Sello may or may not know but it would be important to establish his basis for saying they were confidential.  Was it because somebody higher up had  said they – certain people must not see them even within the – within – people were trying to help Transnet or was it his own decision as to – to – as to who should or could or could not see them?     Hm.    Hm.    But that is if one is talking about people, outside people not to if one is talking about people from within Transnet or people asked by Transnet to look into the issues.     Yes but what I am saying is the – the issue of notwanting to expose the pricing as I understand it.     Cannot apply to the group that you were part of that was given as I understand the position b y Transnet the task of looking at this, could it?    Do feel free to say whatever it is that may lead you to explain his conduct if you think there may be room.  I just want to  see if – I am keen to understand if the labelling the words – these spreadsheets.    As confidential may have been just a genuine thing or may have been part of a certain scheme?     Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    And on the face of it if that was thereason it was an illegitimate reason to say the least?     It is just that it does not – you seem reluctant to say yes.    Yes.    Yes    Ja.  Well we – we are not closing the door to alegitimate explanation for the confidentiality.     We leave the door open but to the extent that certain reasons might be the reasons we looking at whether they would be legitimate reasons or illegitimate reasons.  But if it is other reasons we do not know we will hear when the right people come and explain.     Yes, yes.    Yes.    Ja and you give your opinion.    Or based on the analysis you have done.     Thank you.    So the other day I heard evidence that about 1000 laptops or computers disappeared at Transnet and they were never traced and it was never traced who – what happened to them and who was responsible.  So this is – today I hear of another six and in this case we are talking about computers, laptops that were said to have information that could help with – help with some investigation into some of these things.   And those two from what you understood were not traced?    Thank you.    Of course technical consultation refers to consultation with the technical team?     Ja.    Ja okay.   Take your time Mr Callard if you need – if you need me to adjourn for five minutes?     Five minutes?    Let us adjourn for five minutes.     Yes Mr Callard.    No, no that is fine it is understandable.     That concludes?    YEs.    Ja no, no we are done.  I am concerned that I do not see Mr Molefe for the next witness.      Mr Mokoena?    I see Ms Molefe – Ms Molefe is responsible for that slip of the tongue.    Hm.    Hm.    Well we can closing or not closing is neither here nor there.  We can let him go.    He will apply his mind and I take it he would supply you.    With a statement that deals with ..     To that version and whether he needs to come back to deal with that may depend on what his response is.     If his response is I have no issues with this version or I agree with it there might be no need for him to come back.   If there are issues then there may be a need. So I think it would just be on the basis that he will deal with that and as soon as he has reverted to you with his response then if there is a need for him to come and deal with it in the witness stand then arrangements will be made.    Hm.    Ja.    Ja.    Ja no that is fine.      Thank you very much Mr Callard for coming forward to assist.  We appreciate it and chances are that you may be asked to come back.   And I have no doubt you will be agreeable to that.  Thank you very much you are excused.     Thank you.      Oh I saw that he was not here so I thought he mightnot be ready.  So [indistinct].    Oh okay.    Okay shall we resume it is twenty to shall we resume at twenty – at quarter to?    Ja.    Okay.    We will adjourn and resume in five minutes which will be quarter to one.    We adjourn.INQUIRY ADJOURNS  INQUIRY RESUMES    I was nicely surprised Mr  Mokoena to hear that it is not that you are not available.  You are around.     I thought – I thought maybe you thought we would take too long …    With the previous witness.    Okay, alright.  Thank you.  I see that we will take a short time and then we will have to adjourn.  It is okay but let us start.     Is it Robert or Roberto?     Roberto.    Okay.    Oh, ja.  I was wondering.    Yes.   Hm.    (Intervenes).    Ja, thank you.    Good afternoon.    Huh-uh.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Yes, thank you.  While the Registrar is proceeding there I say this for the benefit of Ms  Molefe I thinkMr Mohammed Mohamedy is one of the witnesses who m ay have dealt with the issue that – relating to the witness after this witness.     Oh, I am sorry.  Is the spelling correct?     But – but the way you pronounce the surname is youdo not pronounce the V?     Oh you pronounce it.  Gonsalves, okay thank you.  Okay.    Well I was wondering whether we should adjourn at one or we should just go on maybe until quarter past and then – just so that we …    Pardon.    Ja, let us go on until quarter past one.  Is that finewith you?    Yes.    Ja, okay.    I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Did you say 17  April just now or was it 30 April?  I see 17 March in the statement.  So I am trying to see if …   Ja, okay.    Okay.    Yes.  No that is fine.    We do not - I do not know if you were here.  We donot know want anything similar to what we had about a few days ago. Okay, alright.    In regard to mixing up names.    Hm.    Yes.    That is Annexure RG2?    Yes.  Let us adjourn.  We will adjourn  until quarter past two.  We adjourn.    Yes Mr Mokoena you may proceed.    You gave evidence before lunch to the effect that youhad advised or your consortium had advised that this relocation should not happen because everything would be – it would be better if everything was done in Gauteng, is that right?  Am I mixing up something?    Yes, and what was the reason given for not accepting that suggestion or advice?     But – I’m sorry – was this a second preference to say manufacturing should happen in Kudupoor t only, the first one was – oh that was the first preference ja, oh, Durban was not the preference, it was the Gauteng preference, okay.    Are you going back to the statement?     Yes okay.    So these would be costs that wo uld be, all of which would be saved if the manufacturing happened in Kuduspoort, in Gauteng.    Ja, and this is the amount or this is the list that could be saved.    Okay.    Yes.    Well you said 8 March and I see two 8 Aprils, are you sure 8 March is the right date?     Oh okay, okay.    Thank you.    Mmm, mmm.    (Laughing) I mean that’s about half ...(intervention)     More than half.    And that’s the dormant company that you were talking about?   [coughing] excuse me.  Your calculation of the relocation costs was about R9 million, is that right?     R9.7 million.  So this company at this stage inexplicably says R26,3 million well it has got some whatever it says here but you say ultimately it was 600 and something million?     Yes.    Yes.    Hm.     I am sorry, I am sorry.  You have lost me.     And maybe in part because I h ave been thinking about what you telling me.  These kinds of amounts that were just claimed and paid.  Okay where are we?     Hopefully somebody else will come and – and say there was no reason to be shocked this was all justified.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Thank you.  229 you said  Mr Mokoena?    239.    Okay.    It is okay let me – that is 239?    Executive Summary?    Yes okay.    Ja.    Okay.  Okay so I am sorry.  Where is the R580 million?    That figure?    Yes thank you and then go to – do I go to 217?    Oh where we were just now?     Okay I see it here.  Thank you.    But as we talk about these figures I asked you earlier on what justification or what Transnet said when you put your suggestion or preference to them that the manufacturing should happen in Gauteng.  You said they said something like they wanted to speed – as you understood their argument why did that – why was that necessary?   But if one looked at the costs and let us leave it at – at your figure of 9, something million.     Did it seem – did this seem to justify all those costs to you, all of that?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm. MR ROBERTO    Ja.    Ja it would just depend on the finer details I wouldimagine – finer details of around that decision.  I guess always subject to how much it is going to cost to do that.      Probably if you – if you are a state entity it is not like you just using your own money. But as you say the re may be – there may be value which – on which one cannot put rands and cents or rand value if you talk about expansion of skills and so on.  But of course as I say subject what the costs will be. Obviously also one would look at long term benefits of tha t – of splitting you know.  Okay alright.     Yes but it is – it is what makes you to reject it is thefact that it is improper.  If you thought it was proper by all means you would welcome it I have no doubt.  But the problem was that you took the view that this was improper.    Hm.    Yes.    Okay, okay is it page 7?     Page 8.    Yes okay thank you.    Well you have just said in effect that you had enough relevant expertise and experience to do whatever calculations neede dto be done and why did they need BEX ja?  Do you want to compare the expertise and experience that your team or your consortium had compared to BEX’s and I know that you said they were a dormant company and so on but just talk, contrast the two for me?     How many directors did this company have with whom they concluded this contract BEX?     Hm.  And I     About 10?    Oh Annexure 10.    Thank you.    Hm.  Ja.      He?    He might have had experience yes, yes.    And a very relevant expertise.  Well maybe the witness must tell us whether they did any check on what that director’s professional and practical experie nce was?  What experience or qualifications he had that may be – may have been relevant to this kind of project?  Are you able to shed light on that?     But was your understanding that they were shocked by this they just had not done their homework before deciding that they would have this arrangement with this company, contract with thiscompany?  Or was you understanding that they knew and they may have had other reasons to continue and conclude the contract with them?    Yes thank you.  If they were aware that might meanthat they may have been up to something that was not pro per.  Are you able to indicate what you think?  Why would they – why would they want to let a company with no experience, with really that had been dormant and with one director that had operated on the basis of a turnover of less than R4 million want it t o handle hundreds of millions or rands?  Why would that be beneficial to them?     But how could a company with no experience orexpertise in this sector that you were involved in be able to get I do not how many indistinct] I mean hundreds and hundreds o f millions or rands above what a consortium with a lot of relevant expertise and experience could get, how could that be possible?     I mean if – if we talking about for example accounting and auditing business and – and one business wants to buy another one or some arrangement, I would not have much experience and if you – if you took – you a Chartered Accountant you would do far bette r thanI could ever dream to do to negotiate anything because you have an appreciation of various features of the business and certain nuances and understandings.  So how could come in with no experience, no knowledge, no exposure to the sector and be able  to do that better than you?    Hm - but you say you – you never checked whether the single Director what his or – was it a he or she?  What his or her professional background is.  Was it a Chartered Accountant like you or was it somebody with Matric only?  Was it somebody within anything that one can rely on maybe to – to explain this phenomenal success in the negotiations?    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Maybe I should just say something.  I should not be misunderstood.  I talked as we are talking about what experience the BEX Director had.  I said maybe it was just somebody with Matric.  I do not mean that people with Matric – you know - cannot have experience and expertise.  So I just want to – to – I was just comparing for example you are talking about in the example I gave of financial Chartered Accountants or getting – you know – for that you would need – I would imagine – you know - to be on at least the same level as the people in that sector but certainly there are m any people even withoutMatric who are very good in their jobs and who have lot of important and relevant experience.  So I do not want to be misunderstood in anyway.  I was just comparing with a situation where you need somebody with certain – you know – academic qualifications in that sector but maybe you might be given somebody who does not have that when that is essential.  So that is what – so I thought I must just explain that.    Thank you.    Thank you.    Well in your statement you do not seem to deal much with the content of that meeting – the discussion.  I know you have just made two sentence or so.  If you are able to it would be good if you can tell me more.  This is what you said and that is what the Transnet delegation said or Mr  Gama if he was the only one.  Oh, not he  was not the only from Transnet.  There was a delegation.     The exchange – the issues you raised – you know.  You told us the issues were of concern to you.  Did you raise the same issues?    Yes and what was their response?     Maybe if you can you can give their response to thedifferent issues.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  So – so you say their – well did you tell them one there is going to be no relocation here?  Did you – did you …?     Ja and what – what did they say?  That they insist that there was going to be relocation on their  understanding?    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  At that time when you met with them where were these costs?  I mean – they have been moving up.  Was it around what figure were they at that time if you are able to remember?     Okay, okay but you are saying that at that meeting they were not able to tell you why you were entitled to – to that amount?    Okay.  So – so it was not even a situation where they would tell you something but you – an explanation which you find unacceptable.  They simply said they would investigate?     Which means they did not – they – they might not have been aware.  That is one way of interpreting.  That they might not have been aware but that is difficult to say because they - they would or maybe they would investigate by talking to people who were much more involved maybe.    Yes.    Yes, yes.   Ja.    Yes.    So – so that meeting the variation had been signed?     You had not seen it?    But if they had signed – if it had been signed then they should be - they should have been aware of the justification - if there was one?    And do you remember who – who had signed onbehalf of Transnet?    The variation.    Yes.    Ja.  No as long as you – you know that to be the case.  So certainly Mr  Gama who was at that meeting having signed heought to have known what justification there w as and he – I take it – he would have known that at some stage those costs had been estimated at 9-something million.  So now at that stage they had gone up to 0-something million.    Hm.  So unless he had signed without interrogating those amounts which – which would not be good in terms of looking after – protecting Transnet – Transnet’s interests as well.    Huh-uh.  Yes.    Yes.    Oh it was long after.  I mean at least about a month or so.  Yes.    Okay.    And then …    Ja.    Oh, more than a year later?     Oh.  I thought it was a month – the same year.    And did they ever come back to you?  They  said they would investigate.  Did they ever come back to you and let you know that this increased amount that you thought you were not entitled toyou – you were actually entitled to it by virtue of A, B, C, D?     Yes.    I am sorry what documents were those?     Oh, okay.    Yes.   Correspondence and minutes and so on.     Ja.    Okay.    And Silinga had been one of the people who had attended the August meeting?    Yes, okay.    Ja, what - what is that now?    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   Hm.    I am sorry.  So on – on – so paragraph 36 reveals that they did actually come back to you.  After the meeting of Augustthey did come back to you or you had interactions and in terms of those interactions Silinga – was Silinga a male or female?    Mr Silinga indicated that they were investigating having conducted audits to establish among others how the R647 million had been arrived at.  So by this time which was a year later – over a year later – the amounts had – the amount has gone up to 600-something million.    Yes, okay.   But I am sorry.  I may – I may have – I may have misrepresented and you may have agreed – wrongly agreed.  After your August meeting, 2016 is the position that for the rest of that year they never came back to you?     Yes.    Oh that was still …     Okay, alright.    Okay, okay.    Okay, okay.  So in other way  or another you got to know that they were investigating?     Ja, okay.    Before that except for the fact that you may have got to Transnet’s attention, Transnet’s attention pos sible wrongdoing by your co-directors as minority directors and they in regard to a business relationship or contract between Transnet and your company why would Transnet be interested in whether any disagreements among yourselves have been resolved becaus e the majority and the minority, do you know?  My own thinking is that if you brought to their attention that forargument’s sake, let us say what you brought to their attention was corruption they would be obliged to look at it because they shouldn’t be party to any corruption and nobody should have engaged in corruption relating to any business they were doing, that is Transnet but other than that why should it be their business whether you were getting along or not, because I guess if you’re not getting along results in you not being able to do – carry out your contractual obligations then they should just say look if you don’t – as long as you perform we are not concerned about your own issues among yourselves, but if it affects performance in terms of the contract we might have to terminate it and give it to somebody else who is going to perform.  Why are you – one gets the impression from their letter as if you said to them yes we have resolved our issues that would mean they mustn’t continue to find ou t whether there was anything untoward that had been done by anybody from the company?   But am I right that in their letter they seem to be concerned about whether you are sorting out our issues?     Yes but why did you – why should the shareholderissues concern them, why did you take that one to them?     Oh they made that clear?     Ja okay.    We will take – we will adjourn for today and we will resume tomorrow at ten, so do come back.  We adjourn  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Good morning Chair.    Thank you.    Chair before we continue with the testimony of Mr Callard.    Thank – thank you Chair.  Chair before we continue with the testimony of Mr Callard this morning I would like torefer the Chair to Exhibit BB4[c] I called it the black folder.     And I would like to point out certain things in respect of that folder.      The Chair will recall that when we parted on Monday that folder had BB4[c] and BB4[d].  In dealing with BB4[d] and at page – from pages 26 Mr Callard referred to three different responses by CNR to the – as regards the question of impact of TE on their price.  The Chair then re – wanted to find out if the request fromTransnet for clarification was included in the bundle and Mr Callard’s response was that it was not in his bundle.  Over  the two days Mr Callard has located the request, has filed a further supplementary affi – a statement in order to introduce this request and that Chair now has been tendered in as BB4[e].    Thank you Chair.    Then Mr Callard if we may continue we are under time pressures today we are encroaching on Mr Mokoena’s time so the less we can inconvenience him and the witness and the Chair of course the better.  Thank you.    Just to…    Thank you Chair.  When we parted accordingto my records Mr Callard we were at page 49 or your statement and you had taken the Chair through the inconsistenci es regarding the interpretation of BAFO across the diesel bidders.    We rose before you dealt with your paragraph 190 which is actually the conclusion of that chapter.     So if we can pick it up from there and then overleaf you start on a different issue which is analysing the BAFO price itself and its reflection of the real cost of the acquisition of the locomotive.    Then if you can take us through that.  Yes we are now at your 190 at page 49.    Or perhaps you might want to summarise from 188 because I – just to make – place things in proper context.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    And Chair on my notes we had dealt withparagraphs 181.  He had started on the inconsistent interpretation of BAFO across the diesel locomotives.    Just to make sure I am on the same page with the Chair.    Yes.    A66?    And that Chair will be in BB4[b].    The – it is the Annexure 66 that is divider 66.     Which starts at 583.    And you specifically want to take us to page?     Now for the record Chair it is 66A, 589 is 6A.    You recall 66 is in two parts.    Yes.    Yes, yes.     We are there.    Yes.    Mr Callard I do not know if you ar e able to assist.  In reading Annexure 98 which is CNR’s response of the 10 June 14 indicating a drop in price from 39 to 27 at – that is your paragraph 187 you have quoted it there.    Would our reading be correct if we conclude that to the extent that that is a response to the letter – the invitation byTransnet as per para – as per Annexure 95 you will with this is 184.  That response went beyond what Transnet required of the bidders to do?    95.    The 4 January.    Now looking at the response and what CNR claims to have been deducted to reduce the price to 27 mil lion based on your knowledge and experience are those costs relevant todetermining the costs that are deducted are they relevant to determining the total costs to be incurred by Transnet for the acquisition of the locomotive or are these options that can be ignored?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  Transnet then receives this Annexure 98 which is CNR’s response.    To the request for clarification as regards the hedging and escalations, what then transpires ?    Yes.    Yes.    Annexure 7.    Yes.   How – if one has regard to the response of the 10 January which states that the price has now reduced to 27 million per locomotive.    And then…    No reduced to 27 million,    Yes.    And at the same time in response to a further letter from Transnet to CNR indicating that it did not indicate the following currency amount per individual currency and amount when CNR refers Transnet back to their tender proposal o f 30 April 2013 as you state in your 189.    Are we then not talking about two different purchase prices?  Did the 30 April 2013 tender proposal also propose a price of 27 million?  I am trying to reconcil e that response to what is stated in their letter of 10 January reducing the purchase price by 14 million – by 12 million?    Yes.    2013.    So when they – the refer Transnet back to that offer when the 39 has reduced to 27 does that address the querycontained in your paragraph 188?  Because we are now talking two different prices.  We started at 39 which is what was in their proposal in April 2013 what eight months later they say that price has reduced to 27 million?  On 14 January when it is indicated that they do not indicate the foreign currency amount per individual c urrency and amount they refer you back to their original proposal.     Yes.  No my question is can you assist us in reconciling all these documents?     Yes.    Okay.  Yes.  That clarification I wanted to get thank you.  And you do indicate that the next day then what is referred to as the best and final offer responses are then submitted to the cross function evaluation team?     And that is the figure that finds its way into page 589 Annexure B of 589?     The table 66A.    Yes.      The memorandum yes.  Okay then I think Chair we then have clarified the issues that Mr Callard wanted to deal with or dealt with and unless there are any clarities required that will bring…    Thank you.      Absolutely.    Yes.    As a discount?    What do you mean table at page 11?    Yes okay.   Oh okay.  The table at 584?     That figures discounted by 12 million.     Is what now appears…     Yes.  And now it is that figure that goes into the memorandum from the CFET?    Okay at 584?    Thank you.  You – you proceed to then express a view that the very  BAFO prices which are now set out in – we know in the memorandum at page 584 do not reflect the real cost of the locomotive?    Can you explain why you so conclude?     Okay.    That would start at page 639 of BB4[a].  Apologies BB4[e] my apologies.    BB4[b].    Yes.  Apologies Chair.    We are at BB4[b] and locating Annexure 83.     Which starts at page 639.  83 Chair.     That is where you were.    And it is because I got corrected from the side so when I checked my files I got – she misheard – she thought I had said a?  So Chair apologies.      We were right – in the right file [b].    Annexure 83.   Yes.  Yes Mr Callard we are there.     Typed 40?    679.  Yes.    Annexure 83 am I correct?     And at that annexure you would like us to turn to page 679?    Okay.    Yes.    [c]    [c] Chair.    [c].  Supplementary BB4[c].    Thank you.    Yes Mr Callard.    Huh-uh.   Of your …    At page 37.    Thank you.    And before we leave that topic I interpret from what you have stated that what is presented in the memo is a misrepresentation of the actual cost of the acquisition of the locomotive?    And the element that is d educted from the cost whether in the BAFO or in the original bid to present a misstated BAFO will only in the future or in time creep back into the cost for the real cost of the locomotive?     Noted.  Thank you.  Have you covered everything you – you wanted to tell the Chair about as regards the BAFO not reflecting the true cost?  Is there anything outstanding?     You have?    Because you now jump to 2018 this is after 14.    Before we get to 2018 after your – after this process and the submission of the BAFO and before Janu ary 2018 did you have anything further to do with this process of acquisition?  Wereyou engaged in the process of acquisition in any form or manner?     No?    As you indicated your paragraph 193 you performed a financial analysis in January  2018?    And you explain what information you had at your disposal at the time and the assumptions you had made?     You deal with then from 195 the January  2018 price validation and firstly is that flowing from the financial analysis you had performed?    Yes.    Now what I want to understand is there is a – you have told that you performed a financial analysis.  What – when you have a heading “January 2018 Price Validation” we are – we are basically talking about information you uncovered in the process of the financial analysis?   Before you get to 196.    You used to concentre.  You said you conduct a financial analysis at 193?     Okay.  At just before 195 you have a heading “January 2018 Price Validation”.  Those are not two independent processes.  It is the same process?   You just give it a different name?     Thank you.    Yes.    Then – then you may take us through what you did in that price – that financial analysis and what you uncovered.     Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.   Before you do so …     With your reference to your 196 for the record you make reference to the contract finally – the 49.5 billion finally contracted for the 1 064 locomotives.  You confirm that that contract was concluded in 2014 – March 2014?   And the business case had stated 38.6 billion as a total cost – estimated total cost?    The contracts are concluded at 49.5 billion?    Excluding options and contingencies?     And then you – you undertake this exercise to determine whether the increase of 49.5 billion was justified in the circumstances?    Yes.    Please go ahead.    Ja.    And while we are on that just so we remind ourselves the 38.6 billion that was deposited in the business ca se and as you confirmed by McKinsey in their assessment excluded only borrowing costs?    Thank you.  Alright please proceed.     Now before …    Before we get to the spreadsheets …     And I – the Chair has noted that at the time you did this financial analysis you worked on the BAFO?     But notwithstanding on your calculation insofar as electric locomotives are concerned the ETC taking into consideration forex movement in the period between submission of bid  and conclusion of the tender – of the contract the electric ETC hadmoved to 40.45 billion?     Against a 49.5 billion?    Contract amount?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay, you wanted now to turn to the spreadsheets?    I think Mr Callard is now at his paragraph 206 page 53 Chair.    Yes.    Sorry Mr Callard.  I think the Chair missed the name.    You provide the name.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.    Okay.    We are at 208 of your statement, yes.     Okay and that is page 39.    Yes.    Yes.    Before you do so.    You recall when you first made reference to the Excel spreadsheets the Chair wanted to know if they are in you r file.    Now can you – can we identify …    They are annexures.    Indeed Chair.    Yes.    BB …    4B Chair.    77.    67.    Sorry Mr Callard …    And again for record pur poses.    Now response to the question whether or not you have the Excel spreadsheets in your record …     You have referred the Chair to Annexure 77 and you say that it is in respect of the diesel locomotives?     67 – my apologies.    That is in respect of the diesel locomotives?     You then just mentioned other annexures.  Should we note that they also are spreadsheets – Excel spreadsheets and that they relate to the diesel locomotives or what point were youseeking to make?    Okay (intervenes).       Mr Callard perhaps if I may assist, you have done precisely what the Chair requested, your paragraph 1591 if I read it correctly at page 39.  You do indicate there that you are attach Annexure 67 through to 72 as worksheets for the electric locomotives and from Annexure 73 through to 77 for diesel, is that correct?       Yes.       Okay so we’ve located which excel spreadsheets relates to which acquisition as per you 1591.        Okay.      Okay. MR FRANCIS QUENTIN       Do you want to refer to your paragraph 207 that’s where you speak of additional worksheets.        Thank you.     Yes.           Okay so for us not to get confused, we know 67 and 72 are the actual spreadsheets you received, they are not your creation.       And that is so far as the electricallocomotives is concerned, 73 to 77 are the diesel spreadsheets?        You take both sets of spreadsheets and then you create Annexure 78, 79 and 80.        And that is just for ease of comparison.        Okay so those 78.79, 80 are your creation whereas the first lot is official Transnet documentation?        Thank you.       Okay, alright we found our – we’ve got our bearings now you may take us through them.        Okay.       That’s at BB4(b) page 620.       621?       Yes.       You say this one was titled, media, wheredo we see media on that page?        You said that’s your addition, that’s what you inserted.       Okay.       Now without your additions how is that page to be identified?       Media, okay thank you.       Yes, you may proceed.       Yes.       If we could take a step back.       It starts with a best and final offer entry let’s take CNR at 27billion.       It then indicates that certain adjustments are made as listed thereunder but the detail is not provided.        And it just reflects an interest from the 27 to 34.       Okay now further adjustments are made to incorporate the TE scope.       And the TE scope is then costed at 4.8?        Okay and what is the TE scope there?        It’s blank again. Then after fixing escalation and costs of hedging, we get a new price of 42?        That’s the final locomotive cost?        Okay, you indicate – then the next line suggests that estimated total cost excluding hedging and escalation is 14, is that so?       Yes.       Yes.       Okay.       Okay – oh thank you Chair.  We – final locomotive costs, I’m trying to reconcile the final locomotive cost of 42billion, is that 42million?        My apologies, yes okay. MR FRANCIS QUENTIN       Times the number of locomotives.       Okay.       If I may understand, so what was communicated to the media is that the total cost of acquisition of the diesel locomotives is 9billion is that a correct understanding of that…(intervention).       That’s what’s communicated to the media?        Okay.       Okay, yes.      Still in BB4(b).        616 Chair, that’s where 75 starts.       Okay and before you deal with the content are we correct to say to right-hand corner the word negotiations is inserted by you to assist in identifying the name of the file?        And equally so the pr ice print negotiation diesel 17 March is also your addition for purposes of identification?        Okay and can I accept that in the actual excel spreadsheets, that particular file is called, negotia tion?       Okay, will do thank you, you may proceed.        Okay.       Okay the 36,174 also.       Okay.       Okay.       Yes.       Yes.      Okay.       Mr Callard?      Before you go into the detail of that spreadsheet if I may follow -up on the Chair’s question and perhaps ask this question, having had access to the spreadsheets and being able to analyse them and understa nd them, are you of the view that you were originally denied access thereto because there was an intention to conceal precisely that which you subsequently established?      Thank you.        You want to take us to the detail of the table then?      Thank you Mr Callard.        Paragraph 207, is that 207.1, you want to take us through that spreadsheet where you do a co mparison.       Please consider your 207.1 paragraph, is that the Annexure you are looking for?        Okay and that is BB42(b) at page 624.        Yes.       Okay you go overleaf to 625.       Are we at 625 or 626?       Perhaps it might help to identify it this way, the first main column list all the items taken into consideration, numbered 1 to 27.       Okay so all that will be applicable across the spreadsheet.       Then when you speak of first column it’s this – actually physically the second column.        First small column yes, headed base price,that’s your first column.       Yes we have found that.       Yes.       Yes, now before you go further you have base price, bidder one, CNR and it’s in different colours, grey, blue, yellow.       But after each column you have a clear and coloured column for a better – if I may use that term, the white one.        The clear white column which doesn’t have a heading, it seems to follow, it comes after each column.        We’ve got base one, bidder one, CNR.        And it is populated right through per item.        Immediately next to it is a white column that has…(intervention).       If they’re spaces in-between column.       Okay.       And then to understand, how do we relate the columns to the spaces.       How do we relate that?       Yes.       Yes.       Okay in the white columns.       So my question was,  can we follow the same pattern, the information in the white columns for lack of a better term are – is what is introduced by you?        Okay, in comparing the various main columns?       Okay, now then if we deal with – just so we don’t lose it tomorrow, that base price of 39million and then the base price excluding TE of 27million that information at least we can glean from the response by TNR which indicated that it had reduced its price from 39 to 27, those are the two figures.        The figure that you have in-between the two columns of 12million rounded, that is the difference between the two?        Thank you, you may proceed.       Yes.       Yes.       Yes.       Yes.       Yes.       Yes.       Yes.       Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    And just for record purpose line 26 is headed Additional cost to add to base price.     Yes.      Yes.    Yes.    And what line 14 tells us is that the rate, the US exchange rate at the time and for bidder 1 used a 9 to the dollar exchange rate?    And at line 15 it gives you the exchange rate for the euro at 11.86?    And then it changes during base cost including TE to 9 the US exchange remains the same, the EU exchange rate changes to 12?    That is lines 14 and 15.    Okay.     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    And the 2.7 at line 16 the additional cos t is the rand equivalent of the foreign exchange?     Quoted okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    At line 26?    Yes.      Okay.    Hm.    Yes.    Now before you get to that arrow let us look at the additional cost as reflected in line 26?  Base price is 2.7 and we take that base price to be as at the date of submission of the bid?    11 February what date?     This is 11 February 2013.    2013.    If you look at the – that movement under base cost excluding TE and what period was the – TE being excluded?  Wasthat in…    January 2014.    And then the negotiations column?     Thank you.  You wanted to deal with the 3.765    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Okay.    You – before we dated or we provided dates to these various columns you had indicted there is an arrow that leads to that 3.3,65 odd at line 26.    Under Negotiations.   And the Chair was just reminding that you are moving on to that point now.    You have not forgotten it please?     Thank you.    Okay.    625.    Okay.  I hope the Chair and Mr Callard are not talking past one another but it shall become clarified soon.  I have a sneaky suspicion that they are but…     No as long as you understand each other Chair.    I will try and catch up Chair.  I will play catch -up.  Mr Callard.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Ja.    So then if…     When we deal – when you deal with that page the two columns and I take it now we understand the two columns are there.  One headed CNR and the other headed GE on the right?     Those columns and the…     The white spaces does not count – no Chair.  This time it is not a column I can tell.  The information contained in the respective columns is derived from the documentation.  You have uplifted it as it is?    Yes.    The comment in the centre?    Where you express a view that you find the increase is unusual?    What you also have added are the beige portions on either side of the column?     Which is a calculation of the percentage adjustment that each figure represents relative to the BAFO?     Okay.  But whether or not the actual figures inputted there are correct you have not done that calculation, that determination?    Okay.      Yes.    Hm.    Yes.  And before you more off that entry 3 escalation up to signature date you have 3498 odd for CNR, right?     An escalation up to signature date?     And that is what the escalation would be for CNR?    For GE under the same item you have 484 ?    Absolutely.    I accept.    No, no.  Alright it – 484 is reflected?    As an escalation up to signature date?    Regard being heard to the – before I say – your analysis of that is that for GE the escalation would represent 1.99% of BAFO?     For CNR it would represent 12.8%?    Now regard being had to the fact that the closing date was the same.    The bids came in more or less on the same dates?    And that signature date would have been the same?    Can you explain why the impact of escalation for the one would be 1.99% and for the other would be 12.8%.     Oh okay.  Thank you.      Yes.  And CNR and GE were competitors for –in this bid?    Another glaring one correct me if I am wrong is item 6 batch pricing adjustment.  For CNR it is 1%, for GE oh no they have reverse roles it is now 12.98%.  Now and I take it you cannot explain that as well?    If you were to guide the Chair who must be turn to for an explanation?     Other than GE and CNR it is – they – those who inputted these figures into the excel spreadsheets to try and explain to us why this anomaly.  To whom would you suggest we turn?    Say the number again please?     Okay    We at 56 at the top paragraph.    Okay.   Yes.    And then we back tracked a bit.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.      The engagements have…     Have been had with Mr Laher.    We will address the Chair as to how…    When and – to present Mr Laher before you Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    [Mumbling}.    He was acting in …     Okay.    Okay.    Mine is slightly different Chair is if the spreadsheets.    Established precisely that point what was the point of undertaking the exercise because it just takes reference by Mr Laher to the very spreadsheets at his disposal and he will have a key understanding of how 49 billion is arrived at, is that not the case?    So there is – there are – there is no further investigation or calculation you had to do to explain the jump from 38 to 49 billion?  All that informa tion is in the spreadsheets already?    May I paraphrase?  Can I – I would like to rephrase that please?    If Mr Laher had regard to the spreadsheets at his disposal would he have had a clear understanding of how the ETC moves from 38 to 49 billion which is the question he had posed to you?     Okay.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    (Intervenes).    But Mr Callard I think it goes further than that if I may.  At 197 having been requested by Galeni and Pita to do this through reconciliation at your paragraph 196 …     You state at 197 and I quote “…Executive Manager Finance Freight …”    “…and the purpose was to show conclusively that forex hedging and escalation were included in the business case.”     And in order to undertake that exercisereference is then had to the spreadsheets which contain that information.  So it comes back to the same point.  so although the request was not from Mr Laher, Mr Laher participated in a process to answer a question that could very well have been answered by provision of the …    Spreadsheets.  Is that a fair summation?     Okay.    Thank you Chair.  Your statement then further deals with the same – similar exercise done for the electrics ?    And it follows the same logic?     And the same anomalies that you have identified in respect of diese l you find in electric as well?     Yes sir.    You wanted to point out one other thing in respect of the spreadsheets?     Okay.  According to your 207 that should be – my apologies – your 201 I think.  They should start at 67 to 72.  Is that – are you looking for that annexure – annexures in that range?    He is first trying to locate …     7-0?    Okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.   Okay.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    So if – if I may.  Let us take the – the first table or box.  Is that – what does that box represent?  Is that the price as at which point?    Yes.    I see it is 60.    And as I go into the second box do I interpret the – the number against cost after TE scope of 59 as a reduction after 60?    Is there a correlation between the two?    Okay.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.      Thank you Chair.  We have dealt with your paragraph under analysis of March 17 negotiation spreadsheet, Mr Callard and you’ve taken us through your Annexure 78, 79, 80, the comparisons you made based on the worksheets you actually received.  Before we leave that topic, you state at your paragraph 208 .7 at page 55 that some formulas used in the negotiation worksheets have hallmarks of reverse engineering to achieve a desired result, do yousee that?       And in the last line of that paragraph you state,  “This particularly applies to the foreign exchange component and cells coloured in yellow”,Now I need you to explain to the Chair what you mean by reverse engineering and for that purpose perhaps it might assist if we use an Annexure we’ve already used in the hearing Annexure 78 at page 625.  Now with reference to that Annexure could you explain exactly what you mean by reverse engineering to achieve a desired result and what you – cause of the desired result was?  78 is the negotiation spreadsheet for diesels.     I’m reading at 208.7 Chair at page 55, top of page 55.      At that paragraph Mr Callard introduces a concept of reverse engineering to achieve a desired result.          And then he does so with reference to the cells coloured in yellow.  I then want him to explain what exactly he means in that paragraph, by reverse engineer ing, firstly and to explain what desired result he said applied and to do so with a reference to anAnnexure that we’ve worked on already, which is Annexure 78 the negotiations worksheet for diesels.        Just a second the Chair should – to locate the Annexure, Annexure 78 Chair at page 625.        Yes Mr Callard.       Yes.       Yes.       And Mr Callard you say that this reverseengineering is not visible in the PDF format of your Annexures?        So in order for the Chair to satisfy himself that there has been a case of reverse engineering you suggest that we look at the actual excel spreadsheets or the spreadsheets that make up the negotiations for diesel and/or locomotive as the case – and electric as the case may be.       I don’t know if you are able to help us now that – you cannot because you don’t have the documents before you, once again are you able to advise who we may turn to so the Chair may satisfy himself that there is some element of reverse engineering, to assist us to work through those sprea dsheets?      Yes, who may guide us, they won’t show us reverse engineering but if we were to pursue your concept who do you suggest we sit down with, working through the excel spreadsheets to satisfy ourselves that the concept that you now referred to is applicable in some or other regard?        Okay.       Yes thank you very much, we will certainly pursue that.       Actuary Chair, sorry actuary you said notary.       Absolutely.       Thank you Chair.       Maybe deal with the entire 208.       Yes.       Yes.      At page 54?       Yes.       Please explain.       78…(intervention).       Yes.       Yes.       Yes.      Thank you.  That then brings you to the end of the issues you wanted to address regarding the evaluations and the BAFO negotiation on both the diesels and electrics.            You proceed then from your paragraph 29 to share certain observations and draw conclusions from paragraph 209, my apologies Chair, page 55.  You make certain observations and your draw conclusions which you list there, you don’t  have to read verbatim what is set out in that paragraph but perhaps you might want tohighlight key observations and what conclusions are to be drawn from the evidence you have provided.       Yes.       Is it possible though to conclude that as a bare minimum CSR would have come in at a higher price?        Yes.       Now on this construction are you suggesting that it would appear that the options were costed twice?        If they constitute part of the 4.9billion as part of contingencies and yet were part of the makeup of the original –of the actual cost of the locomotive, does that constitute counting the options twice or accounting for them twice or would that be too simplistic an approach?        Yes.       Okay thank you.       Can you explain – well you did say inexplicably, ja, I withdraw the question, yes please continue.        Alright you then have a following chapter headed, Report to Gama and others.       And you reference Annexure 86 and 87, these are the reports in respect of the electrics and diesels respectively.       And in the report do you highlight the issues that you are now sharing with the Chair, the anomalies and the fact that you cannot justify the jump from the business case estimated tota l cost of 38billion to 49billion or 54billion or as the case may be.     Okay thank you.  You may proceed.     Yes.  Well before you get to go – if that was all your conversations.    Or engagements with Mr Gama and others.     I see you reference Mr Gama andcommunication with Mr Silinga – it is a Mr right?  Yes Mr Silinga.     You recall the Chair I think asked you about the excel spreadsheets?     You had indicated that Mr Laher had been of the view that you cannot have access to them because they are confidential but you nonetheless succeeded?     Did you after working on the spreadsheetshave – ever have occasion to eng age Mr Laher on these spreadsheets?     In what form and what was the outcome of that engagement?    Yes.     And if I may just follow up on the Chair ’s question then.  You gain access to these documents in January 2018?     During the financial analysis exercise?     This was four years after the contracts were concluded?   14?    Yes.  So there could not have been any potential prejudice to any bidders? There were no longer – there was no longer an issue of bidders, the decision had been made?     Before we leave that and I know you wouldlike to get to your closing remark – concluding remarks.  There is an – paragraph we skipped which I think is important and in particular for how the commission goes forward on some of the issues you have raised at paragraph 214 pag e 56 at the bottom it starts.      214 yes.    Hm.    Yes.   Are you not aware of any other file having contained those s preadsheets?    Yes I am posing a slightly different question if I may try again?     Now that the calamity has befallen us and the laptop has gone missing that particular file is it your view that it could only be located in that laptop and what is the likelihood of it being available from another computer or lapto p?    Remote.    Do you know if Transnet has been lucky enough to at least locate any of the six missing laptops?     Okay.    Did you ever get to know how any of the laptops or Ms Mdletshe’s laptop came up missing?     You did not know the circumstances that led to that?    We – you are now at from page 58 then you deal with your concluding remarks.      Yes.    Yes please.    Thank you Chair.     That would conclude the testimony of…     Mr Callard unless the Chair has got any questions for Mr Callard?    Mr Molefe?    No Mr Mokoena is just around the corner.      He is in the building.  Oh.  Chair as to regards Mr Callard we have issued a significant number of 33’s arisingfrom his testimony and his statement.     We are so far in receipt of one response and I am – perhaps it is appropriate I place it on record from Mr Yusaf Mohammed.     Mr Yusaf has not applied to cross-examine Mr Callard but he seeks to adva nce his version on some aspects of Mr Callard’s testimony.  This was received Tuesday and shared with Mr Callard yesterday.  He has not had opportunity to correctly – properlyapply his mind thereto.  We request therefore Chair that I do not close the evidence of Mr Callard.  He will come back at a time to be determined by the Chair to deal with Mr Mohammed’s version and any other that we may in the interim receive.     Yes Chair.    Indeed Chair.    In response to that.    Yes Chair.   May I indicate Chair that in the course of his testimony.    Mr Callard expanded on some averments hehad made which read on their own in the statement did not seem to implicate certain persons which he expounded on in oral testing [indistinct] and that has resulted in us issuing further 33’s.     So we are still in respect of some implicated persons within the fourteen day period.     We will revert in about ten days or so to indicate whether we have received any other responses and we will take guidance from the Chair on how to deal with it.     Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Mr Mokoena had requested about three, five minutes for a change of the guard. I do not know if the Chair wants to sit here while he does so or?  Everybody is ready it is just – so I removed my files and then he can step up to the…     No he is ready.    He is ready to proceed Chair.    Quarter to one?    Yes Chair I will let him know.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Understood.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you Chair.    Correct.    Correct.    That is correct yes correct so.    Thank you counsel.   Yes Mr Chair.    A66 which is at page 583.      Annexure 6…     3.   I would like to take us to page please 589.  589…    A.    66 is in two parts.    Thank you.      66A is the legible copy.     Thank you.  Thank you Counsel.  Chair the point is – I wish to make is that this qualified BAFO does not include all these items, contingencies and the word etcetera.  If we look at page 589 which is now this legible copy and at the bottom just above the note we have the last line is forex due to the difference.  They explain the difference between the first and  the second BAFO’s and we will see there the difference is made up of the words used are discount on price.      So this qualified BAFO with all these qualifications is taken forward into this evaluation d ocuments asa discount.  It is my belief and contention that a qualification like this cannot be presented or should not be presented as an unqualified discount is the point I wish to make on this one.     Yes.    Indeed yes that is correct.  It is a response to the annexure in     The letter in Annexure 95 and I would also agree that it goes beyond – the response is beyond what was requested in the base – in the letter of Annexure – in the letter of the 4 January.    Yes.    These are elements of a price to provide a locomotive if I may call it free onsiding.  There is the locomotive free – or ex works.   Ready for delivery.  I highlighted the point on my paragraph 182.    That we have now taken out all of the manpower costs, factory overheads, admin overheads and if the wording is to be believed may I use that phrase, overheads and mark -up which would imply that well thank you I have sacrifi ced my entire mark-up by taking this out.  What I – I cannot explain the inconsistencies I only see the inconsistencies and the use of the word etcetera as I highlighted earlier is – does not constitute a BAFO it is a qualified price which cannot be taken into a discount.    Yes.   I not this because and it struck me as being unusual.  I do not say it is incorrect I only say it was unusual that following this response then on the 14 January and that correct – on paragraph 188 that correction is noted that Mr Molefe writes to CNR.    Mr Molefe’s letter may be found at Annexure 99 which is paragraph – page    788.    His letter of the 14 January  to CNR requesting and it goes out under his personal signature.     Yes.    Or sorry by 27 million.    Oh sorry to 27 million.   Yes, sorry, sorry, apolog ies.    Yes.    No the base price I would go back to 187.1.   Their wording we have reduced our base price in the TCO model as referred to in your letter from 39,7  million rounded down to 27.3.  So 39.7 million refers I do not want to say exactly at the moment we can check that up to their offer of the April 2013.    Yes.    Correct.  When a – sorry.    When a locomotive bid is submitted one is asked for an effectively a rand price.     Yes also by the CFET.      It is also the figure which finds its way into page 584 which is the table on the opening page of the memorandum.    May I just make one comment.    Please Mr – Counsel just to be quite sure.  The table on page 589     Describes how the difference is made up and it attributes that 12.3 million as a discount.     Correct the table on page 84.    Sorry it has an eleven on it.    584.    Million the composition…     And makeup of that is outlined on page 589.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    The estimated total cost of a business case or of a memorandum like this would be so that the organisation could have an understanding effectively of the – what it is going to cost them and of the cash flow.  The memorandum which have submitted are not a reflection of the real cost of the locomotives.  The – to illustrate this the make-up of a real cost of a locomotive is set outin pages 40 and 47 of Annexures 83 and 84 respectively.  May I just refer to that briefly/    Let us use one of them page 80 – Annexure 83 page 40.    Ja.    BB4[b] yes.   And     Annexure 83 that final     Thank you.  If I could take you through to page 40 which – sorry to page 40.    The annexure which is page 679.    Annexure 83    79 yes.    My apologies.    679.    Page 23 of the supplementary. Annexure 80.    Without going through the detail Chair I just wish to highlight that the table at the top of that page indicates the elements which make up a locomotive price.     And I would go back to this point was quite a deep one because I refer in 193 that even analysis which I did earlier these figures were taken at …     193 of my …     Paragraph 193 of the statemen t.    I had also on the first reading this assumed this price going forward is a real cost of a locomotive.  It was not a real cost of a locomotive.  Calculations I performed on a real cost of a locomotive were not on the real cost of a locomotive.  When one unpacks this one sees that in fact it was quite different but equally the point was made the locomotives are then evaluated not on their realcost but on the impact of TE.  We have covered that.  I have subm itted that the impact of TE was not part of the evaluation process or should not have been part of the evaluation process.     Mr Chair …    Chair if I may answer you by referring to page 156 of my statement – sorry – to paragraph 156 of my statement.    Through a lengthy process …    Page 37.    I said   And that is point four that I made    On the electric locomotives what was removed as the BAFO – as the impact of TE is later added backinto the evaluation – into the cost structure of the locomotive.  That is the case for the electric locomotives.  I do not see the same patter for the diesel locomotives.    I …    I am comfortable, thank you.    Yes.    No.    No.    Yes.    Correct.   No, no.  I was asked to perform a financial analysis in January 2018.    And in that process I uncovered – as I said – pertinent and anonymous information relating to the final contract on price and the inconsistencies in the make -up of the locomotive price.    May I take you through that process which really starts then at 196?     Sorry.    Yes.    It is the same process.    The same process.    Sorry – they have a different name.    Yes.    And I am taking you through m y report from paragraph 196 this is on page 51.     Heading “January 2018” I was approached Ms Nomfuyo Galeni and Mr Garry Pita to insist – to assistin reconciling the 38.6 billion which was deposited by t he business case to the 49.55 billion which excluded options and contingencies which was finally contracted for the 1  064 locomotives and this was shortly after the publication of the Werksmans Report and Transnet as I understood it wanted to develop a for mal response.  I think it is - being recorded elsewhere many times.  The Werksmans Report was considered inconclusive.    And there were two points to that.  I was – well I was part of a team that primarily compromisedMessieurs Yousuf Laher and Mohammed Moola an Executive Manager Finance and others participated in a secondary role.  Effectively our brief was twofold to show conclusively that forex hedging and escalation were included in the business case a nd reconcile – secondly, reconcile the 38.6 billion of the business case to the contract amount of 49.5.  The first task of showing that forex and hedging were included in the business case was easily completely and we have covered that at some length.  Re ferences to the numerous instances where it is mentioned and incorporated in the financial models.  I just comment it was a personal observation that the business case may have been better served if we had clearly indicated in the business case that the assumptions around forex and hedging had been clearly identified rather than requiring a detailed reading of the business case but that is purely a personal observation.     I – I make note that the prices  used in the locomotives of – I describe the process which I followed and I do not know that I need describe the whole thing in the record.  If I may just to them – really to the conclusions.    (Intervenes).    That was the March 2014.    That is an ETC yes.  Excluding options and contingencies.    Yes.    How could we reconcile it?     Yes.   We – before …    Yes.    What we wish to demonstrate Chair or analyse what were the factors which could cause the 38.6 to move to a higher price whether it reached – whatever price it reachedand there were a number of factors which we  considered.    Sorry.    Yes.    Yes indeed.    The 38.6 was a figure which McKinsey developed from their m odel which was in the – put forward in the April 2013 business case.  I had seen that model.  I had commented on that model and was comfortable with that price.    It had followed very much the same figures …    Which we had submitted a - a year …    In (indistinct) or so.    I was comfortable at that level.  Ihad no reason to …    To dispute that model figure.    Certainly.  Two significant time lapses Chair.  The one time lapse was the business case was approved in April 2013.  It was awarded in March  2017 so that – sorry – March 2014.    Thank you.    About a year later.   There were significant foreign exchange fluctuations …     Over that time.    However the request for proposal had gone out – if I recall the date correctly - was in July 2013 with a closure date in April 2000 - sorry – I forget when the closure date is.     The business case went out in July 2013.  May of the bidders put their base price around August  2013 which was even six months previous prior to the business case.  So when we talk of escalation up to award and forex change up to award from the bidders perspective it was not from the time which we – the business case was approved but from the time which they did their initial calculations.  So which takes it back even slightly further than the year of the business case.    Excluded only borrowing costs.  It included forex and hedging.   The process which we followed was first to take the original business case.  We created a model which replicated the McKinsey model with a high degree of correlation because the McKinsey model did not lend itself to this incremental analysis.  We created a new model.  Went through stages of incremental analysis of here is the business case.  Let us delay the business case for a year because it was delayed.  See what the impact of the forex on that was.  Having delayed it for a year we then said let us then shorten the delivery period because from the initial seven yeardelivery period deposited by the business case it came to three years – shorten the delivery period.  Then we changed it to what were the real prices used by – tendered by the locomotives.  Then we changed the local content not to reflect the 60/40 which was used in the business case but to the actual local content as stipulated by the bidders to try and arrive at a figure but long story short on this in retrospect – and I make this point – those calculations were flawed because as a going in position I used the figures which were presented in the BAFO – in these memorandums and have just indicated that those were not the real prices of the locomotives.  That was the information which we  had available at the time.  So those calculations of January  2018 were flawed but in that at that time I became aware of two spreadsheets.  I call them the March 2017 negotiation spreadsheets.  One deals with diesel.  One deals with electric locomotives.     Sorry.    Yes.    Correct.    40.45 that was the total electrical and diesel.    Correct.    Yes, yes and I make the further point in 204.1 bottom of page 52 …     That I had used the same prices for diesel and electric locomotives when I corrected this the ETC reduced to 39.497 but I stressed that those were wrong prices used in this BAFO and we had some debate at the time on the impact of TE and my interpretation to the team at that time was the way this was presented.  A TE price shoul d not make an impact of the – I wasunaware of the detail which I had - subsequently I covered to see that the TE price should make an impact.     Which leads then to the 205 that this initial analysis however as commented earlier does not include the premium TE as the BAFO prices used were not the true base price of the locomotive.    During a big presentation I becameaware of these two spreadsheets.  I was told …     I will highlight the spreadsheets in about …    I will go there.    I will go there.  I was told that the spreadsheets were restricted and/or confidential and could not gain access to them.  I subsequently asked the Freight Rail CFO for accessto the files and (intervenes).    They were …     Correct.    Hm.    No, I can remember.   Mr Yousuf Laher.    Well he said they are restricted …     Mr Yousuf Laher.    He was part of the team working on the same memorandum.    The team is – as I mentioned – essentially compromised Mr  Yousuf Laher, Mr Mohammed Moola and myself and there were others in a secondary role.     But that was the – the core of the …    The three of us formed the core of the team.    Correct.  I said these are crucial spreadsheets.  They – they appear to have the figures relevant to the – the prices and the – the information we need to come to this conclusion of what was the – how do we move from 38.6 to the 49 billion or the 54 however we wish to interpret it and …   This is in January  2018 – January 2018.    February 2018.    Ja.  This is part – when I wascalled back to do the analysis.    Way after …     I was called back to do the analysis.    I see these spreadsheets.  I say sorry.  I approached the Transnet Chief Financial Officer and said please we need these spreadsheets.  After some days I was given thespreadsheets.  By that time …     That was Ms Nomfuyo Galeni.    Got the spreadsheets.    I cannot recall that – what justification was given except that they were confidential.     If there was a further justification …    It escapes me.    When I received the spreadsheets and they are put here.  Could I skip 207 please …?     But go to 208.    208 of my statement.    May I backtrack.  Apologies.  I have to backtrack to my statement …     And I need to go to …    Could I go to 159 of my statement please?  Page 39 paragraph 159.    Page 39 …    Paragraph 159.    I am referring now to these files of Excel spreadsheets and they are crucial to an understanding of the development of the final locomotive pricing.  One was for electriclocomotives and the other was for diesel locomotives.  I mov e to paragraph 159.2.    Sorry.    They are in the file.   Certainly, certainly.    Fine.  Chair could I take you first to the diesel locomotives please .  I will use the diesel ones which are Annexure 77 …     In the second bundle and they are at page 622.    Sorry.    Can we start at Annexure 77 please?    Sorry.    Apologies.    Apologies Chair.    67.    67.    Yes.    The – the annexure …   That is one of the spreadsheets.    There are – there are – the diesel locomotives are covered under 67 – Annexures 67, 68, 69, 70 and 71 because they have various  worksheets in the file and the various worksheets have a – a significance to them.  If I could take you through please first to annexure …    Ja.   Yes.    Yes.    Annexure …     Yes.    Correct.    I was going to go through – let us record all the spreadsheets first.     Then we have electric - the spreadsheets for the electric locomotives which go from Annexure 60 – 70- sorry 67 to 72.      No I was just going to bring themall into the record but I wanted to take you through the Annexure, through the spreadsheets themselves.        Correct.       Thank you.       Yes on paragraph 207 I added three further Annexures.       Because the spreadsheets are difficult to interpret one has to page through spreadsheet by spreadsheet, I added three further spreadsheets which – where Iextracted the information from the existing spreadsheets and presented it on a side by side basis for easy comparison.  This was Annexure 78, Annexure 78 for the diesel locomotives and Annexures 79 for CSR locomotives and Annexure 80 for BT sometimes also referred to as Bombardier those are used synonymously.       Yes not my creation.       Yes.       Correct.       Correct.       The – yes.       I may add that on the official Transnet documentation you might find some – occasionally some arrows which I have pointed to highlight where some figur es go to the other but the numbers are unchanged.       As an example of the – or for the diesel one, and I would like to  start with the diesel first please.        Which is now…(intervention).    I’m going to the spreadsheet and I would like, first just to illustrate why the spreadsheet is important and I would like to take us please to – media, media – to Annexure 76.         And – page 620 and I’d like us to turn to page 621 please, it is a A3 page.       621.       The left-hand title on the page where I say media 17 t h of March that is my creation on the page fo r identification purposes, I extracted that to print.  On the left -hand side of the page, the print negotiations, diesel 17 t h of March 2014, that is also my creation on the page to reference it, to reference the printout of the page but immediately below t hat it has awarded 465 diesel locomotive contract.  This one is entitled, media, this was what was given to the media as the result for the award of the tender.        That’s my identification of the print page.      It would be identified in the worksheet – sorry in the excel spreadsheets and there are multiple spreadsheets, it’s simply called media.        Soft copies are available and it was just to identify the page – excel sheets have multiple pages and this was to identified the page that was being used.        Thank you, on the left-hand side it has, award of the 465 diesel locomotive contract and it details there the best and final offer per Board’s submission, we see again the CNR 23 – 27.3billion rounded, we see the GE amount and then it has, adjusted for changes, and there are four lines there which are blank.  Ithas a best and final offer updated to the 17 t h of March then it has various adjustment lines which are blank.        Then it has new price including TE scope, we have two figures there for cost to fix escalation to end  of contract, cost of hedging and we have then a line called the final locomotive cost and two further lines, estimated total cost excluding hedging and escalation and estimated total cost including hedging and escalation.  The totals for the diesels there , including hedging and escalation we’ll see is 18.375billion.  That is the component of thediesel price that was finally awarded.        Yes.       Yes.       Correct.      Correct.        Yes.      No that is cost to fix escalation to end of contract under that line.        It is blank in this line.       Yes.       Yes.      Multiply 232 by the 48 – 42million point 8 rounded.       We get 7.888billion.       With a similar exercise for GE those two figures are then added up to the 14billion, if we take that to the next line where they include the hedging and escalation, we get t he18billion total amount for the diesels.        That is 42million per item.       Times number of locomotives togive us that final cost.     The reason I bring this – refer to this sheet first is that this was the media statement and it reflected how the amount was made up, this is what we contracted on.  If I may take us…(intervention).         That’s what was communicated.       May I be very specific, I cannotstate categorically how it was communicated to the media it’s called the media sheet but certainly, internally this was how we received the makeup.       If I may then go back one Annexure to Annexure 75.       Still in BB4(b).       And go to page 617.       Correct.       Correct.       Correct.       If we may look at the table at the bottom right-hand – bottom left-hand corner it is called, latest offers, and you will see it has a line called BAFO and we have various linesgoing down there right to the very last line, coloured in green, and it has a price there under CSR of 42.875 020 which agrees with the figure which was in the media file which we have just r eferred to.       And similarly for the General Electric locomotive.       Correct.       What is now apparent from thisor what comes from this, is we now have an indication of the breakdown of the prices.      Those elements that were missing from the media statement are now on this sheet where they talk to, and I read from the top,“1) we have BAFO, 2) the exchange rate impact on the loco,escalation up to signature date.  Warranty/SD bond costremoval is the third line, fixed cost Forex adjustment on theother items and batch pricing adjustment”.      Recall – we’ll go into the batch pricing in a moment we then get a new price, then we add cost of new TE scope so we have another addition of TE scope here.       This sheet now gives us a breakdown of how the various elements of the price and would explain the makeup of the price.  The – if I may just draw some attention to some apparent anomalies on …(intervention).        I’m happy to deal with it now Mr Chair.     What I can certainly say is that the information contained in these spreadsheets…(intervention).        And if I may just…(intervention).        Yes.       That is my interpretation yes.       That is my interpretation.       If I may just…(intervention).       I cannot say whether it was his decision or an instruction, I can’t say Mr Chair.        If I may, just on page 61 – may I refer to the diesels where we put them all together and take you please to the diesel ones as a relevant and that is the…(intervention).      The spreadsheet where I do the comparison.        207.1 of the diesel locomotives, Annexure 78.      624?       And I’m looking at page 625.        The first – this spreadsheet is my compilation, I have taken the figures from the previousspreadsheets and put them on a basis of side by side for purposes of comparison.  This spreadsheet has both CNR and GE the first three columns relate to CNR the columns 4 to 6 relate to GE on the right -hand side.  I’d like to take us through the CNR  columns first please and there are three columns.  The first one is headed, base price…(intervention).       Page 625.       The first of the smaller columns on 625.       Yes.       Across the spreadsheet, correct.       The second small column is headed base price excluding TE, bidder one, CNR.        And the third column is headed, negotiations, bidder one, CNR.       You’ll see the spreadsheet has various colours and some of them are the cells – worksheet cells are in yellow.       Yes.       The white one.       Yes.       Call them spaces.      Yes.        We have been through the reduction which is – and the BAFO price and we’ve seen the – approximately 12million reduction there and the new figure is in there of 27.3million rounded.  The differenc e I have highlighted in that white space in-between. ADV MAHLAPE       I inserted that difference.      Yes I did.       Correct, correct.       Correct.       Correct.      Correct.       Thank you, I spoke of anomalist variations in the foreign exchange component.       Could we go down on the extreme left-hand side we have the lines 19 and 20, import content, foreign value first rate and import content foreign value second rate.       Let’s deal with line 19 first please, import content foreign value, first rate.        Under the base price which is now the first column, that is given as US Dollars and I would round it 484 000 rounded.     In the second column it is yellow and it is now given as 493  000 dollars rounded.        Small change, small increase and I’m not questioning that increase but if we now go to the third column.        Which is called, negotiations, wewill see that the US Dollar component as in this s preadsheet jumps to 918 000 dollars effectively – virtually doubling the imported content in US Dollar terms.      If we go to the second line which is the import content foreign value second rate, line  20.     When it comes to base cost excluding TE that euro decreases to 325  000.  That is a drop of 668 000 euros.    These foreign components by multiplying the – them by the exchange rates of the day could I takeyou to like 26 please?    Add to base price.    That 2.7 million is a function of the United States Dollar rate times the exchange rate of the day which wesee up there as first exchange rate used by bidder line 14.     Added to the import – the line 20 the import content foreign value the euro value times the euro exchange rate applicable which was in line 15 second exchange rate used by bidder euro.    Effectively one takes United States Dollars times it by the exchange rate, the euros times it by the exchange rate add the two together and that gives us the additional cost to add to the base price.    Correct and that is…   And then it changes to 12 and 12.    Yes.    Yes.    Sorry?    Other figures are in rand Mr Chair.     In rand yes.    Yes.  So the purpose of this was to take the imported content and convert it to the change in the imported content and convert it to rand .   And that gives us 2. – the 2.7 million.   Correct.    The impact of the foreign exchange.    Taking forward.  If we then take that to base cost excluding TE.    Which is now the second column and we see that the US Dollar remains the same but the Euro has been significantly reduced.    The bottom line around this is thatthe additional cost to add to the base price has changed from not adding 2.7 million.    But we now add 1.3.    1.3 million.    Yes.    I would show later how I believethis figure is in fact taken into the evaluation calculations per se.     But going to lie – column 3 where we now see this significant increase in the foreign exchange components.  We have seen the US Dollar go to 918  000 and the Euros go to 774 000.    The additional cost to add to the base price now increases to 3.7 million.     No that is now the first base price is – was normalised to the 11 February.  The…     2013.    That is the green column.    Yes.    That one would have been January – the January 2014.    January 2014.    The negotiations column should correctly be around the time the negotiations March 2014.     If we turn over to page 626.    And we will see…     Ah – yes the point – it is an observation Mr Chair.    That where we have columns in yellow highlighted in yellow.   My analysis of this is that the columns in yellow need to be scrutinised very carefu lly.    In fact this is part of that exercise.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No.      Yes.    In depth interrogation.    I think we are     We understand.   Okay.  So to recap.    On page 625.    At the – near the bottom of thepage we have additional cost to add to base price.     With the top of that arrow 3.765 million.    If we turn over to page 626.    There are two columns there one is headed CNR and the other headed GE. The CNR one is in the centre of the page.    At the top of that column we see that arrow coming down again.    And it comes up to 3765.    And if we look to the left hand side we will see that is the exchange rate impact on locomotives.     Mr Chair as I use this as one example because I find this type of inconsistency across many of the spread sheets but I highlight this as one key example of this.  May I then return back to page 626?     And by way of illustration if we were to assume that the GENC and our locomotives are relatively similar.  They are both diesel locomotives with equivalent power and output.  On page 626 you will see cells marked in beige, a deep beige,a light brown.    And I have put – highlighted that as a percentage of BAFO.  And I make the comment ‘there is a wide variation in percentage increases on the BAFO prices which is unusual’.  We compare a base GE price of 24 million rounded with a base CNR price of 27 million rounded and we have seen that.      Yet one would on the reasonable assumption that the local content or the foreign content of thelocomotive may vary by one or two percent.  Not to say that everybody will be exactly the same.  But the exchange rate impact on  the BAFO of CNR is of that 3.7 million we have been talking about.     That is 13.8% of the BAFO price.  Similarly for General Electric it is 8.23%.  That is I contend – and that is quite a variation.  If we look at the escalation up to signature date.  Now escalation is the South African escalation with – with the imported escalation.  But given the imported escalation as we have mentioned in the business case and elsewhere that is pretty stable and flat a nd we have said 2%.  The escalation up to signature date for CNR of that 3.4 million is 12.8%.      By comparison the GE escalation as recorded here and please I am making no assumptions these figuresare correct.  I am purely saying what is recorded and what is shown as – makes up the price.  The GE escalation is 1. – is 2% effectively that difference is significant.    They…    The figures are what are reflected into the final prices because these final – these are the final prices.   I have not gone behind.    I have not –    Mr Chair we have not been able to get behind these figures.    Ja.    Let me just say this Mr Chairman.  The figures as presented.    Show significant variations and unexplained variations.    That is the point I would …     Are presented yes .    Yes.    Yes.    What I have added to this is…     The comment in the centre.   Yes.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    And…   I have to add this because it cannot find the – the logic that would support some of these figures.     We have not found the logic that would support some of these – many of these figures.  That – I use that to show the inconsistency in the diesels.     3…   Escalation up to sig – yes 349.    Yes.    That is what is shown on the piece of paper?    Yes.    I do not want the word you there.    Correct.    Yes, yes.    Of BAFO price yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    I cannot explain it.    And that is why I described elements of these figures as being anomalous and deserving of further interrogation and investigation.  I believe these figures cannot be explained or I certainly cannot explain the [indistinct] of these figures.     Yes, yes.    Cannot explain it.    I make the point later in mystatement.    May I refer to paragraph 2.11.1 of my statement.    2.11.1     Top of page 56.    Sorry I – let me go to 2.11.  2.11 please bottom of page 55.    Mr Jooste Laher is the primary author of these two excel spre adsheets.      2.11.    Bottom of the page.    Chair you asked me who should we turn to?    Sorry Counsel you asked me who should we turn to?  I say that Mr Laher is the primary author of  these two excel spreadsheets.      To page 56.    2.11.1.    For the detailed explanation yes.    I see at that point.    Yes he is.    Yes.    And…    In my paragraph 2.11.1.    At the top of page 56.  With this knowledge which I have gleaned from the spreadsheet and similar through the electrics I was disappointed that the exercise undertaken in January 18 in good faith to determine the increases.  It was undertakenin good faith but Mr Laher with full knowledge of the pricing, detail and negotiations chose not to share this knowledge including the spreadsheets and evaluation reports with the members of the team to arrive at an honest and accurate assessment of the increase in the ETC from 38.6 billion to around 49.55 billion or 54 billion if the options are included.  That is…     We could explore further the electrics and the like but I make the point in the diesels.     I was contracted in …    The exercise in January 2018     I came there in good faith to conduct this exercise.    We had this team of which Mr Muller and Mr Laher were part of the team.  He had full knowledge of the spreadsheet and I indicated that he …     Did not wish to share this spreadsheet.    When I eventually gained access to the spreadsheet.    And was able to undertake this exercise and see what was happening.     I was disappointed that the spreadsheet was not shared.    That is the point I was making Mr Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    That should have been the case yes.    With the…    Yes.    I – if I may answer in a slightly convoluted manner.    The elements of the price movement or makeup from 39 to 49 or 54 whichever figure you want…     Are set out in here.    I made the point earlier that there are anomalies here that I cannot explain and I believe it very difficult to explain.  It is possible that Mr Laher did not share the spreadsheet because he did not wish to explain the anomaly or did not wish to be questioned on the anomaly and that is possibly why the spreadsheet was restricted.    No it was Mr Garry Pita and Mr Nomfuyo Galeni who asked that the exercise be done.    I do not know if they were aware.     I do not – it is my impression and recollection from the interactions we had that they were not aware.     Because my recollection is that in my engagement with Mr Nomfuyo Galeni for access to the spreadsheetshe was not aware – she gave the – I was under the impression from my interaction she was not aware of the existence of this particular spreadsheet.    Of …    That is the impression I got yes.    Be …    That …    And that was the essence of my point in 2011.1 Mr Chair.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Ja, the spreadsheets.    Fair summation.    It is my understanding Mr Chair that Mr Laher is a qualified chartered acco untant.    Yes.   It follows the same logic and the same (intervenes).    Yes.  Not every figure is absolutely traceable through from the top to the bottom as I – as I have done here but they are of such a similarity that they add to that.  I would like to add one further point …     To these spreadsheets however.    Yes.   Yes.  I would like to …     Could I answer that perhaps later Mr Chair?    I would just like to cover that.    I will certainly address that point.     (Intervenes).    Hm.    Yes.  I just which to turn up an electric spreadsheet.   Hm.    If I could take you to – to Annexure 70 please “Negotiations”?     Annexure 7-0 page 606.    We have been asked – the increase in the price of the 1  064 from the 38.6 to the 54 billion and the price – increase in the price per locomotive up to 54 billion - million per locomotive has already been extensively aired.   Page 606 and it is titled “Negotiations” and it is from the Ne gotiations Electrics Sheet 17  March …    It is a side bar calculation.    And you will see there – there is also a price of make-up for locomotives following the similar format to what we have seen beforehand - BAFO, new price and final cost.    On these negotiation sheets I would just like to draw the final figures there.  We see a final figure at cost after TE scope.  Bombadier 60 million per locomotive.   CSR 55 million per locomotive moving later on to 59 million per locomotive and 55 million pe r locomotive.  It is anomalous that the negotiations per locomotive would take us up to that price per locomotive and the logic that would take us to that price is missing.    And for me it – from this it begs the question as to how the negotiations were conducted.     I cannot say at which point and I cannot interpret those figures 20/7 – those figures above the Bombadier box …    But you will see that the cost at the bottom of that column …     60 million per locomotive.    Yes.    I cannot talk to any possible correlation.  I merely highlight that this a side bar calculation.     Of a cost per locomotive which is  out of the ordinary to anything which we had been dealing with and it is considerably higher than that which we have – we questioning the price up to 54 billion in the price increase per locomotive.  So a side bar calculation which has a price of 60 milli on per locomotive or 59 million per locomotive I do not understand.     I described to Mr Chair that the process followed two phases.  The first phase was the selection of the bidders and I have described why my concerns regarding the sel ection of the bidders.  The second phase was the negotiation phase with the selected OEMs.  The negotiation phase took place or under the auspices of a Negotiation Team which the members were mandated with signed mandates by Mr  Brian Molefe the Chief Executive.  The Negotiation Team collectively – individually and collectively did the negotiations.  I cannot talk to the role that each one played individually within the Negotiation Team but …     It is my understanding that it was – I think the leader – the – I know one of the joint Chairs.  I know Mr Jiyane was a joint Chair of the Negotiation Team.     I cannot say who the …    I cannot recall who the leader was.     I need a moment or two for that.  But the Negotiation Team collectively were operating under or should have operated under a mandate to achieve the best possible price for Transnet whether they did I think it is my – in answer to your question – the Negotiation Team should answer for the price increase.     No it – negotiation – letters signed by Mr Molefe appointed Mr Singh and Mr Gama as members of the Negotiation Team as well although I understand they were not there full time …    But they were part of that Negotiation Team.    Correct.    Correct.  It is my absolute understanding that that is – was the chain of command.  We had aNegotiation Team.  The Negotiation Team reported on a fairly regular basis.  I believe it was on a daily basis - I believe it was a daily basis to Mr Singh.      How he took it further on a daily basis …    I am not sure.  But the end result of the negotiations from the Negotiation Team resulted in these prices.       Yes.       The…(intervention).       Okay, if I may illustrate the concept of reverse engineering by using, perhaps a – an example, if we have a – we are given a price of a locomotive and we know the escalation going forward, we take CPI going forward for example and over a two year period then the final pr ice we would pay is a straightforward calculation, from here’s the base price of the locomotive, apply the CPI forward and I get the final price of thelocomotive.  Reverse engineering would apply when I have a base price of a locomotive but I for example,  I’m now negotiating on the final outcome price, I choose a final outcome price and then I reverse engineer to determine the effect of the escalation.  So where is the escalation and forward Forex hedging should be derived quantities based on known formula that are derived.  Reverse engineering would apply when one chooses a final price and then works backwards to achieve some figures which would tend to justify that price, that would – it’s illustrative of the concept reverse engineering. It is not visible immediately from the spreadsheets here but ifone examines the excel spreadsheets in their raw format and one looks at the formulas on those excel spreadsheets one can see that a number of figures have been reverse engineered where a figure you would expect to be the outcome of a calculation is given as the result and it is used to derive what should have been a given like CPI for example and we have seen escalation figures used here that have been quite high.  In reference to this sheet and others we’ve  already highlighted the variations in the movement of the exchange rate, what I’ve said were anomalous movements in the exchange rate across the CNR diesels from the US Dollars, we’ve highlighted that already, the first three columns where it goes from 48 4 000 to 493 00 then to US Dollars 918 – the Euros, apologies if I’m going too fast the Euros are on line 20 go from 993 down to 325 up to 374.       774.      I’m sorry, possibly I was…(intervention).       If one wishes to influence the price at the bottom of those two columns in yellow.        Then one would choose to use those prices to achieve a desired end result price and that is anexample of what I mean by reverse engineering to achieve a desired price.  So if one wanted to achieve, at  the bottom of column 2, 30.4million rounded then a way of achieving that low price and see there is a significant reduction in that price.        Would be to artificially lower the foreign content because that would then result in the lower price and that would be an example of reverse engineering.        That is exactly the example I’m trying to illustrate Mr Chair, exactly that example.        I was trying to illustrate it at a single level, you have taken it to the full locomotive price.        No, no.       If one looks at the actual excel files on a computer which then demonstrates how the formulas are made up and that is what illustrates the reverse engineering.        Excuse me are you looking for a name of a person or an entity?        I could show you personally but also the actuaries that were engaged by MNS  would also be able to demonstrate the same concepts yes.       Yes.       Certainly, it would have to be – they would have to be asked specifically on this spreadsheet, please have a look at this formulae can you explain this formulae, how it was derived, what was the makeup of this formulae, where did you get the figures please show – get the figures from, please indicated the traceability of those figures through whatever documentation to come to that figure, that would be the exercise to be followed.        Yes I think what one would ask an actuary to do would be to please show me the logica l progression and change in the prices and demonstrate that they followed a reasoned sequence of events and/or traceable documentation to arrive at the final price, if that…(intervention).        Correct.      May I just – because we have not got it into the record 208.2…(intervention).        Entire 208?       This is really a summary of what I have stated before – what we have covered before.       But on examination I could not credit that the figures in the spreadsheet we re a true reflection of the real cost to the locomotives for the following reasons.        At page 54.       208.1, “The escalation costs were inflated and I could not correlate these with any of the locomotive modelling I’d previously done. 2)  There were unexplained variations in the foreign exchange component affecting the locomotive price as a change between the worksheets of base cost, base  cost excluding options, base costs excluding TE and negotiations”.        Only that which we have not covered Mr Chair, is 208.6, the diesel price contains – sorry it was the local content version that I was looking for, 208.4 if I may.        “The foreign exchange components amounts used in the final negotiatio ns spreadsheet would cause some locomotives, CSR and Bombardier not to meet the local content requirements”.       The point I’m making here is thatif the foreign exchange amounts are correc t or if they are correct then the local content does not meet requirements.  If I may go back please to the – let’s go to the diesels as it’s a familiar one and that would be…(intervention).       Annexure 62…(intervention).       Annexure 78 page 625 please.       Annexure 78 page 625, and I’m looking immediately to the rig ht of the third small column which is negotiations, bidder one, CNR and we’ll see there is some beige workings in that white space.       And if we look there, we will see– if we look across from line 19 it has – line 19 – sorry line 18 my apologies, total import content percentage per declaration and the figure given in the third column there is 38.9 percent.        Across all the variations of foreign exchange, that figure of 38.9 percent has not changed, that is what was declared.  If we look at the two lines above it we see that those figures have changed in – those figures have changed but the nature of that change does not appear to reflect the v ariations in the foreign exchange amounts.      Yes.       Thank you, the essential component is that adding back the TE component as we will see was done in the – has been done in the electric locomotives we have not demonstrated that here but it’s visible in the spreadsheets, significantly increases the base price of the locomotive and we see how it was initially taken out. We’ve mentioned earlier that the BAFO prices of the 15 t h January memorandum from the CFET Finance cannot be used as a basis for determining the total estimated cost because of what has been – what is omitted.       And I submit that without the detailed knowledge and understanding and in -depth analysis of this, that a reader without access to these documents, the average readerwould interpret the BAFO prices of the 15 t h of January and the memo to the loco Steering Committee as a reasonable basis for comparison and it’s an open question whether the evaluation – the electric locomotives or what the evaluation of the electric locomotives would have been if the base price i.e. before the TE adjustment had been used as a basis for price evaluation.       Certainly both CSR and Bombardier, on that evaluation would have had a higher pricecomparable to what was subtracted from their price by the impact – virtue of the impact of TE. So had that been put in as a basis for evaluation on the real cost to the locomotive, the outcome of the evaluation may have been different.       It is…(intervention).       Um, I – to answer that one specifically I just need to refer back to Mr Molefe’s memorandum but if the – if the base price which is used from the memo while it excluded TE  included those options and that we have seen already it included those options while it excluded the impact of TE is carried forward, yet we have the options counted again, a second time in this – yes that is so. The options were definitely in there in the base price which we’ve seen on the 15 t h of January.       The options were in there, while it excluded the impact of TE but options were in there yes and we are now adding a further amount here for options.       And my point – I go back to 212.3 inexplicably these required options were omitted during the negotiation stage and they were an extensive part of the evaluation stage, they were omitted during the negotiation stage and left to be added later under contingencies.       No I think that’s what is for the record.      Correct.       That was the essence of my reports, my reports at the time were crafted and drafted on the basis ofwhat I knew then and only from an analysis of the sprea dsheets, I did not have access to all the information that I have presented now.  So, they are incomplete in some respects in terms of they cannot be directly compared to here but they indicate the overall thrust of the point that, here the spreadsheets give the full story and there are these unexplained anomalies in the spreadsheets, that was the thrust of my reports.    To conclude in remarks?     That was…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes I did.    It would have been towards the end of last year and my.    2018 yes.    The essence of that conversation was that Mr Laher could not explain the anomalies which I had or – highlighted here because we discussed the same anomalies on a – that I have discussed here and he – ja he could not explain the anomalies or could not – would not.  I – did not explain the anomalies.    The explanation that he offered when we – and we highlighted that he was a member of the negotiation team and the explanation that he highlighted was he was just inputting the numbers.    Inputting the numbers.  Capturing the numbers.    I – and repeating as close as I can to his words, he was just there inputting the numbers, implying that he was taking direction on putting the numbers into the spreadsheet.  I asked him specifically did you not question the numbers and he said no?  The example which I have given on the foreign exchange component if I remember – recall correctly and please – this is not written he said was – it was not his role to question the local or foreigncontent.  We     I cannot recall that I asked – we asked him that question, why he said that Mr Chair.   The others did not – I cannot recall the others in the party at that meeting.     Knew the detail of that background.    I do not believe I asked him that question.    Specifically.    Confidential.    No.    No.    How do you understand the spreadsheets and please explain to us and we did not get a satisfactory explanation.    Certainly because the if I ma y Mr Chair because the spreadsheet do contain the confidential information of the bidders in terms of their pricing.      That would be one explanation that could be offered for now wanting to share them.    It…    There was – there was a very strict wall – fire wall around the information relating to the tenders at that time.  In fact consistently.  It was just fortunate that one I could access this spreadsheet which brought to light I believe the inconsistencies.     Ja.    Ja.    Certainly with the best [indistinct] in the world.    Myself and others cannot explain the variations in these figures.    Well yes.  I am hesitant to…     But I – I am perhaps reluctant to attribute the root cause to an individual but certainly with the inconsistencies and anomalies which the spreadsheets exposed.     I could appreciate some people wanting to keep them not make them available to others.     I do not want…     I may be wrong in my assessment here.    Have seen from this thing.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes contracts concluded March ?    14.    No, no, this is post – way post event yes.    Yes.  As soon as I – as I became aware of this – these spreadsheets and I then emailed – we are talking of 214 paragraph 214?    Yes.  So on 27 February 2018 I emailed Ms Nomfuyo Galeni and I copied her on my emails to Mr Gama but I also requested that if she can please trace and freeze the laptop with the file reconciliation of inflation forex and TE scope 26 February 14.xlx.  May I just ex plain that this is one of those files that is embedded or not embedded but linked to these excel spreadsheet files and I believe it – it would have given an indication of how some ofthose foreign exchange figures and escalation figures were derived at and I was trying to trace that file.  So I asked please can you trace and freeze the laptop with the file – with this file name.  I believe it should form part of the forensic audit.  Someone in Supply Chain Services should have this file and it is often refe renced in the two files that the lady in finance sent to us.    And the two files referred to were in March spreadsheets.    And later I was ready to – I was really disappointed to later hear that the laptop of Ms Mdletshe has gone missing. This is reference in the MNS Report.  I believe it contained the files referred to above.     There may have been other files but that was a particular one as I was going through the soft copy of the spreadsheets there was a continuous referencing linking data to that file and that is why I wanted to trace that file to see what was the source material for some of those inflation forex and TE scope numbers that we were dealing with here.    Sure sorry.   I think remote.    It is my understanding and it was common talk that there were six laptops that were stored in safekeeping which were the laptops that the negotiations – that the evaluation team were working on.  I stress evaluation team.  It is alsomy understanding through what we have heard that all of those laptops have gone missing.  The last laptop that was remaining was the one of Ms Mdletshe and it is my understanding from the MNS Report that when they went to retrieve this laptop that it too was missing which …     I do not know.   I believe so.    Ja.  I believe so Mr Chair.  In the CFET Report of the 10 January it describes in the introduction to that report many of the security measures which they put in place to safe guard their information in that report and how they were not allowed to take laptops home or it – they describe in full the security measures so it was rather as I say disappointing to hear that the laptops had gone missing.   No, no.    I do not know the circumstances no, no.    Than you.    I will paraphrase.    What is in here rather than readthem directly but the programmatic replacement of the general freight locomotive fleet was necessary and because the last batch of locomotives for General Freight had been b ought in 1992 and the greater part of the fleet was way beyond its economic life and we had exhausted all the upgrade programmes we needed to get new locomotives to keep the fleet running.  And certainly the market demand strategy was the catalyst for this  and the change in strategy or responding from creating capacity to absorbing demand could have worked.  It is unfortunate I can believe that the aggressive market demand strategy was not backed up by a rigorous evaluation andadjustment as the market dictated.  And this is with particular reference to the 100 locomotives Supply Chain Services I believe failed Freight Rail in its locomotive procurement process.  With good intention it was to create a mechanism separating technical interests from the procurement process.  But it failed Freight Rail and that it presumed to be the final arbiter of what Freight Rail needed in its locomotives rather than a custodian of due process.  My belief.  It failed to create the mechanism in the 1064 locomotives for program matic procurement adjusting delivery to changing market conditions.  It did have some clauses relevant to that though.  It failed to include essential options in the procurement of locomotives as we have seen here that in the final award options were not included it was to be added as variation orders later.  And for whatever reason it decided on the type of locomotive to be procured and this is in the relation to the 100 without technical consultation.  I add that I do not know of anyone in Supply ChainServices ever read the 1064 locomotive business case.  The aggressive procurement and the shortening of delivery from the 7 years to the 3 years…    With technical team.     None of my colleagues were aware of – it was a surprise to all of them.  The aggressive procurement of the locomotives and the shortening of the delivery from the 7 to the 3 years also severely impacted Transnet and Freight Rail.Transnet Engineering was never going to be ready to be or able to deliver t he locomotives in the accelerated time frame which we have described and Freight Rail itself did not have the capacity to absorb the accelerated delivery and the financial impact was massive with Transnet almost transgressing its cash interest cover and ha ving to increase its foreign borrowings.  The premise of the business case – of the business case that locomotive performance would improve with new more reliable and more powerful locomotives that was the premise.  It is my understanding that the locomotive performance now as measured in terms of gross tonne kilometres is now worse than before the acquisition process started.  We shared a vision, my colleagues and Iof recreating a sustainable, viable locomotive industry supplying between 600 – sorry between 60 and 100 locomotives annually to Freight Rail.  Sadly that vision was not realised and from where we are now it may well be a decade or more before that opportunity may arise again.  Thank you for the opportunity to present what I know from time and involvement and my thanks and gratitude to my colleagues and co -workers.    Could I have a minute please?    Five minutes please?    Thank you Mr Chair and my apologies for the interruption.    Understood.    Thank you Chair. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  If I may recap very briefly going back to 182.   Of my statement.  This was a request on the 20 December 2013 to CNR and other diesel bidder requesting an explanation of the cost per the Annexure E.  And I outlined in 182 the breakdown of the Annexure E costs for CNR and their response.  Noting that – and without referring to the bundle but just looking at the table on – under paragraph 182 that on the fourth line – sorry fourth – third line in that table, the third element in that table, admin, overheads, mark-up, marketing, insurance, financing,interest etcetera and that amounts to some 5.2 bi llion which they quote in their Annexure E.  In briefly in summary then on the 4 January 20 - CNR replied to this on the 22 December and that is in there and they just give a further exposition of that.  I do not think it is necessary to go back to that but the point that we were – that I was seeking to make was that on the 4 January the diesel bidders were invited to submit their best and final offers.  There was a letter to CNR the response was the due on the 10 January CNR replied in the meantime with tw o letters requesting a fourteen day extension and then a 21 day extension but on the 10 January they replied and here I am referring to paragraph 187 on 49 and I am quoting from that point – from sub-paragraph 187.1. “We have reduced our base price in the total cost of ownership as referred to in your [as referred to in your letter of 4 January 2014] from 39 million rounded or 39.7 million rounded to 27.3 millionrounded.This price relates to the cost of manufacture and does not include training costs, logistics, royalties, technical support, service charge, finance costs and contingencies etcetera.”  And the point which I wish to make is that I believe this qualification does not constitute a comparative best and final offer price with that which we heard from GE.  In support of this contention belief it should be noted that the reduction of 12.3 million per locomotive rounded if one multiplies that by the 465 diesel locomotives for which they bid this exceeds the amount of the 5. – this amounts to some 5.7  billion whichexceeds the entire amount in their Annexure E from the RFP and I take one back there to the page – to the paragraph 182 from which I was quoting previously.  In essence what the BAFO purports to be is this significant reduction of over R12 m illion per locomotive that reduction negates all the elements in their Annexure E.  And why I believe this now to be problematic is if we could please just pick this up in Annexure A 66.    These are not options in the sense that we would normally understand the word options as applied to the locomotive of making it fit for purpose.     Under his signature that the 10 January response inter alia did not indicate the foreign currency amount per individual currency and amount bold and underlined.  Inessence highlighting that CNR did not fully respond to their letter.  CNR responds on the 14 January on the same day referring back to their tender proposal of the 30 April that this was – that there appears to have been considerable pressure on this because on the  15 January 14 the and I am reading paragraph 190.  “The cross function and evaluation team finance submit the results of their best and final offer responses to the Locomotive Steering Committee.” And this is on – this is Annexure 66.    One is asked for the local content.  One asks the bidders to specify their local content.  One asks the bidders to specify what is the imported content of the locomotive in –and in the foreign currency and it may be in one or more foreign currencies.  There were – in the 1064 it was generally in dollar but there was also a bid which had both dollar and euros.  One also asks – the bidders are also asked to state the date on which they have applied that currencies in determining their final locomotive price.  So the – for CNR the dollar component of their locomotive price which was asked for in the – in the letter if I may be correct there they just refer back to their original bid. So notwithstanding having reduced the or given a qualified if I may use the qualified BAFO price of now some 27.3 million per locomotive they say that the dollar component of the locomotive,the imported component has not changed.  By implication of this by using inverse logic it would seem that the total amount which they have then discounted would have been a South African Rand by implication, by inverse logic.    Yes may I say while I – look that up.    Table 6A.  And that is the figurewhich finds its way into 589.    As a – made – the table on page 11 the make-up at that price which incorporates that 12.3 is to be found on page 589 so…    And we will – if I then may take you to again on that page to the second last line and we have covered this but I wish to restate the point I will take it forward in a m oment.  On the second last line from the bottom we have the impact of not using TE as a main sub-contractor and will see it is subtracted from that because the line below that is the price used for evaluation.   So if that is the price used for evaluation I  would now like to – with this impact of TE being excluded from this price one cannot use this price for evaluation now as a determination well how much does this locomotive cost because I have excluded an element of the price?  Sowith these prices making  their way into the memorandum as we have seen from the CFET going forward which we have just spoken about the price given forward and taken forward into the organisation is not the true cost of the locomotive.  The reason or in support of this is and we will show later that this TE component price the impact of TE is later added back to this cost when they come to determine the actual cost to the locomotive.  So by not taking this forward whichever hierarchy these memorandums are playing through they are n ot indicative of the real cost of a locomotive and that was the key point which I make here.        No very convenient, I will try and follow that…(intervention).       I would also add that I – and then turning through to – I added three additional spreadsheets.        You’ll see media on the top right-hand side…(intervention).       As well as print negotiations, diesel is my identification of the print page.       May I take that one step further, we have a locomotive cost of 42.875 020 million for 232 locomotives which we’ll see at the top under CNR.        A discount, price to fix the TE scope including escalation and hedging going forward and then cost to fix escalation going forward.       Your question, Mr Chair, I wouldnot like to say what was in his mind as to why he did not want to give it to me, what I can certainly…(intervention).        Is highly relevant and the workings that we deduce from the spreadsheets – I’ve been working back from what was negotiations – sorry from the media statement to negotiations, there are earlier statements of the diesels excluding TE and the base cost and if one traces the path through those spreadsheets they demonstrate a pattern of numbers which a re cause for concern, they show in the spreadsheets, elements or unexplained variations in the foreign exchange amounts which show that those unexplained variations in foreign exchange amounts influence theprices which have been reflected, equally in the final price of this negotiation – of which we have seen here, if we were to accept the foreign exchange amounts which they have here then  the local content – the award does not meet the local content, if the foreign exchange amounts are reflected here but there are – one can see how, in areas, the foreign exchange amounts have been brought into these final escalations.       The first small column is headed base price, bidder one, CNR.       Well we relate the columns to the spaces and that they generally are – show some information in that for example between the first small column and the second small column in that white space that first amount we have there is a minus   12 375 831 which relates to the discount which we have been talking about earlier from CNR and it shows a change from the – may I take you through that – we had that line called one, base price as per technical specification.       On the extreme left-hand side, take that through the base price was initially given as 39.7millionrounded.    Under bidder price – under the base price for bidder 1 that is the first small column it is 993  000 euros rounded.  In the second column…    That is substantial.    Yet when we go to the negotiations column the euros now increase to 774.      I just draw the back to the letter from – sorry.  The letter from CNR which said that their foreign exchange component remains the same as in their April 2013 offer and yet we see this variation across the foreign components here.    Line 26 in the first small column in 2.7 million rounded.    So the 2.7 million and I would just like to correct the impression I gave earlier.  Is taking the – made of the 484 000 US Dollars times the difference in the exchange rate.     Similarly for the Euro it is the difference between the two exchange rates.     You will see there is an arrow touching on the 3.7 million.    626 is the same worksheet I hadprinted over two pages.    And I will show where this comes through now.    The CNR column again gives the same break down of the price as we have seen earlier in negotiations and the media as set out in the total cost at the bottom we have 42  875 million for a CNR Locomotive.   That is the exchange rate impacton the locomotive up to the time of award.  If that is – exchange rate impact of the locomotive at 375 million up to time of the award and it is now included this total make -up of the price and we turn back over the page and I have highlighted what I believ e to be unexplained variations in the foreign content.  This brings to me this 375 into question.      This is as it comes from the spreadsheet.    He was also a signatory to the BAFO evaluation of the 15 January 2014 and he was furthermore a member of the negotiation team for the 1064 locomotives comprising inter alia Mr Molefe, Mr Singh, Mr Gama, Mr Pita, Mr Giani, Ms Mdletshe and Mr Ndiphiwe Silinga who was the general manager Group Legal Services. But with knowledge of this spreadsheets and viewpoint and this was – I turn over to page 56.  I was disappointed that  the …       In fact, if anything, despite the significant increase in the foreign exchange amounts in the negotiation’s column, that is the third column, we will see  that the import content per first declaration and second declaration remains the same, now changing the foreign component one would reasonably expect by virtue of these formulae to change the foreign component and we see there that it does not change.  A side-bar calculation, and tis is my calculation in the beige – in the white space using the figures presented in the third column the imported content moves up to 64%, 64.2% which is outside the local content stipulations of the Department of Trade and Industries and on that basis should have disqualified them. I presented on the base on these figures as presented which make up – and we see how they go – feed through to the final elements that local – that imported content does not hold, similar arguments h oldfor the electrics as well.       I’ve already covered the member of the negotiation team.  I would just add one other point which is an anomaly that when we showed the breakdown of the locomotive pr ices, this included the necessary options to develop a locomotive which was fit for purpose, ready for use, ex-works but in the ETC increase requested by Mr Molefe to the BADC and that was from the 38 to the 54billion, there was this amount in there of – and I read from 212.1, “it included contingencies of 4.9million which would include options and he – I quote from that document, electronically controlled pneumatic breaking and wire distributed poweretcetera”. Now those options were previously included in the negotiations – sorry in the evaluation pricing.  One would reasonably have expected that those would have been part of the consideration of the final cost of the locomotive because that is what makes it fit for purpose.        Without detailing the whole report counsel, when I became aware of the import and content of this – these two spreadsheets I contacted Mr Gama, said please could I meet with him, he asked, please send me a report on what I wanted to meet about, I explained the nature of my concerns. I prepared a report which I sent to him, we met, I met with him and Mr Dipiwe Salinca?, in Mr Gama’s offices, I’d sent the report earlier, the email trace of those – where I sent those reports is in the file, after the meeting I then forwarded the same reports to Mr Salinca, I then jumped back to item in my paragraph 217 that Mr Gama undertook to take up this matter with the Chair of the Audit Committee, the following day I emailed Mr Salinca copies of the memorandum that I’d emailed Mr Gama but I heard nothing further from Transnet on the matter it went quiet.    I and others met with Mr Laher at the offices of MNS Attorneys.  I cannot  recall the exact day but it was to discuss the spreadsheets in particular.      And my estimate it was about October / November of last year.    I – we passed on that I wanted to get – we wanted to get an understanding.     I – while I agree with your sentiments.    Ja.  Any answer to that Mr Chairbecause the spreadsheets contain or contained figures which are unexplained I believe it was kept that way because do not want to be asked to explain figures which are generally unexplained.     But yes.  Let me go so far as to agree with you Chair.  I expressed that as saying I was disappointed that the spreadsheets were not shared.     And I would accept that but Ipresent what I…    Yes there was no consultation wih the technical team that I was aware of.     I would just like to conclude that my thanks and gratitude also go to my colleagues and my co -railway workers with [indistinct] dust on their shoes and may t hey keep the wheels turning.  If I may be permitted a quote from Charles Dickens in the Tale of Two Cities?  “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  It was an age of wisdom.  It was the age of foolishness.  It was the epoch of belief.  It w as the epoch of incredulity.  It was the season of light.  It was the season of darkness.  It was the spring of hope.  It was the winter of despair.  We had everything before us.  We had nothing before us.  We were all going direct to heaven.  We were all going direct the other way.”  Thank you.
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN C ALLARD:  A clear copy of that page because it is relatively indistinct can be found in the supplementary on page 23 of the supplementary Annexure 83.  That has a clear copy of that page.  
CALLARD:Which are described…(intervention).  42million times the…(intervention). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLAR D:     9billion for CNR.    Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CA LLARD:     From what we have here, there is one point I will make now.  This gives us an indication of the breakdown of the prices which is what in fact we were tasked to achieve, how did we arrive at these final prices.  I will jump to a final point in my statement that I was disappointed that Mr Leher did not share this because with this information, why did we have to go through an exercise but from perusal of these spreadsheets and particularlyhere one picks up a number of anomalies and I would take on e through those anomalies and perhaps those anomalies are problematic.  
CHAIRPESON:    That’s fine yes.  
CHAIRPRERSON:     Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELL O:     Okay.
SELLO:So you inserted that difference…(intervention)   So if we understand correctly the spreadsheets do demonstrate how the price moves from 38 billion to 49

INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am Chair.    No Chair.    I am here Chair.   Yes Chair.  Chair the next witness that we are calling is Mr Robert Gonsalves and in leading …     Roberto Gonsalves and in leading his testimony Chair we will be referring to a file which we have taken the liberty of marking it as EXHIBIT BB3 – BB5 Chair.    It is BB5.    I am having BB3 here because I will be referring to it just in passing.    And Mr Chair in order to contextualise his evidence it may be important for us to remi nd ourselves of the testimony of Mr Mahomedy which he testified on the same issues but from a perspective of a Transnet witness.  He will be testifying on the same issues but being one other minority shareholders of a company that benefitted from that similar transaction.  So his testimony becomes quite crucial in that – in that regard because the minority shareholdersopposed and objected to those monies being paid to that entity.  May we – Chair I did not even put before you the file of Mr  Mahomedy because I just want to – to deal with it in passing so that I can contextualise Mr Gonsalves testimony and simply to remind you that on page 3 Chair can simply make a note at paragraph 3.1 Mr  Mahomedy    In as far as the Rule 3.3 Notices are concerned Chair we have complied with same.  I am informed that there is Counsel for the CNR a nd for Mr Wang whom we will allow the opportunity to place themselves on record.     Mr Chair we are then ready to proceed with the evidence of Mr  Gonsalves.  May the witness be sworn in?     Mr Gonsalves you will see that there is a file that has been placed before you and it  is marked as EXHIBIT BB5.  If you open the file you will see that it contains a folder and immediately after the folder it must be an index and that index will assist you to navigate through the various documents that you will be canvassing during your ev idence.  Now could you please turn to a document immediately after the index and please identify same for the Chair.    Yes.  You will let me know is that  a statement that you find there.    Yes and if you could please turn to page 17 – 1-7.  Is that your signature appearing there?     Yes and when was that statement signed?    And do you confirm the contents of your statement to be both true and correct?     Yes.  May you then proceed to share with us your qualifications?     Yes.  Can you also give us background?     Yes.    Yes.  Mr Gonsalves the Chair has heardtestimony of various witnesses from Transnet who dealt with the acquisition of the 1 064 locomotives and from the – your employment history it is quite clear that you were never at any stage employed by Transnet.  Am I correct?     Yes.  You will be adducing the evidence before the Chair as one of the minority Directors of an entity that benefited from Transnet?     Yes.  Now you preface your evidence ifyou may go to page 1 with particular reference to paragr aph 4.  You preface your evidence by the events of July  2012 pertaining to this acquisition of the locomotives.  Could you please in your own words tell the Chair how you were involved or the entity that you belonged to was involved in this transaction?     Chair this is a quite interesting time tostart with a witness and maybe it is the time when I am saying that it is a time to adjourn for lunch as well.     We had (intervenes).    With the fresh legs on his food.  We are prepared to proceed Chair.    Yes.    You also outline for the Chair the structure of this CNRRSSA.  Could you please proceed doing so from paragraph 6 and the following paragraphs?     Yes.    Yes.    Okay.    Ja.  Now in terms of the day to day running of an entity – you know – who was responsible for those activities?    Yes.  Now from paragraph 11 you start now dealing with the events commencing from 9  August 2012 directly relevant to the subject at hand.  Can you please proceed to deal with same onwards?    You wanted to effect a minor change on paragraph 13?    (Intervenes)?    Yes.    So where there is a word Bombardier it should be replaced by what?     General Electric.  Chair we will affect the necessary amendment and make sure that we replace your page accordingly.    Now …    Yes.    We understand Chair.    May I now refer you to folder one Chair - and we leave Annexure 1 – it is on page 19.  Are you there?     Could you please identify that document for us Mr Gonsalves?    Yes and may I refer you to page 178 and if you could please identify for us the respective individuals whoappended their signatures on that document and also refer to the date as to when those signatures were appended?     Yes.  While we are still dealing with that document I know that it will become paramount at a later stage of your evidence may I then refer you to page 27?  Now you have a definitionof a contract facility.  If you can read same into the record and give us your understanding of same and why it will be important to the evidence that you will be adducing before the Chair.     Yes.  May I then refer you to page 3-0 – 30?  You will see also there that there is a definition of delivery point.  Can you please also read that into the record and give the Chair  yourown understanding and significance of that definition?     Yes.  Now may I refer you back to your statement with particular reference to page 4 Mr  Gonsalves?  From paragraph 15 you commence addressing a new topic which is the proposed relocation to Durban.  You may proceed to deal wit h those relevant facts.    Yes.  Now at the time when you were approached by Transnet to – for the company to provide them with a relocation cost would I be correct that at that time there were no physical activities or operations at all in Koedoespoort?     In simple terms there was nothing to relocate?    Yes.  Now may I refer you to foldernumber two which you will find from page 180?     It is Chair and within the two minutes that is remaining before the lunch adjournment could you please identify that document?    So it is quite apparent from r eading this annexure that it was the consortium’s view that it is far better to do the operations in Koedoespoort rather than to locate it to Durban.  Is that my – is that my …?     Yes.  Chair would it be the appropriate time to adjourn?     Yes, now let’s proceed to give more flesh into that evidence by referring it to RG3, that is folder number three Chair, on page 182.  If you may Mr Gonsalves identify that document for us and take us through that document.      You don’t have to take us – you can just take us to the summary as to what was the amount arrived at.        Yes Chair.  Now even though you have said to the Chair there was nothing to be allocated, but we now know from having looked at this document that if there was any amount to beplaced on what is termed the relocation was nothing more than R9.7million as reflected in this document?      No, no we will deal with it in due course.      And do you know whether you know your company or the consortium did have any previous dealings with BEX prior to them now emerging on the 23 r d of April as stated in your statement.     Yes, if you turn over to page 217 you will see from the paragraph that says “whereas” if you can read for us point A and please comment on the contents of that paragraph.     Yes and your comment on these paragraphs?    Do you know if there was anything that significantly changed from when the relocation amount was 9.7 for it to arrive to be R208 that could at least you know explain or justify this amount?    Maybe if we – what we can do Mr Gonsalves if you can read it?     Yes.  And you may proceed with your evidence.    Whatever the reason that might be proffered?    May you please return back to your statement page 8 and summarise for us what your statement from paragraph 29 which I believe it is quite important.     Yes.    Yes – but what expertise would be required for one to really negotiate such a transaction?     Yes.  Now the minority shareholder is also – did have regard to that variation order and they made certain observations as you do from page 9 paragraph 31.  If you can please summarise what is written therein.     Yes.    So clearly they did not want to heed the advice that you are giving them against – you know – having to accept this amount from Transnet?     Yes.  In order to contextualise what you are saying can I refer you to RG15 – 1-5 Chair.  It is on page 263.  Maybe you will be able to explain much more clearly to the Chair what you are trying to explain to us now by having regard to this  document.  Please identify that document first.     And if I may refer you to page 265 with particular reference to paragraph 4.1.3.27.  If you can read it and give your perspective on that clause.    Yes and subsequent to that the minority shareholder also did write a letter to the company expressing their concerns.  Am I correct?    Chair it is page 267.  If you may turn to that – that page Mr Gonsalves.  For the importance of this letter and what is contained therein Chair may through your indulgence request the witness to read it as it also finds itself later o n when - when the witness testifies about reporting the matter to the Hawks.     Yes, you may do that.    Yes, yes.    Yes.  Was this letter reacted to by the majority shareholders?  Did they react?  Did they …?    Yes.  Now did you proceed to have the meeting instruction with that letter with Transnet in order to raise the same issues?    Paragraph 34 Chair page 9.    Yes and what happened in that meeting?     Yes.    And importantly on that page is the date.  What is the date of that letter?     let us – let us …    Chair just - just to clarify.    Those dates.  The meeting took place …     On the 23 r d.  The meeting took place on 16 August 2016.    It is more than a year later.    Yes.    So there was no doubt that when youmet with Mr Gama and the delegate from Transnet already a variation order which you have referred the Chair to on page 2 61 has already been signed by Mr Gama?    Reflecting the amount that you informed the Chair about?    35.    Yes explain that to us.    Yes.    And then what happened after that telephonic discussions?     And what – what transpired after that meeting with Mr Silinga?    Now during these meetings that when you met with Mr Silinga and at the time w hen you met with the delegation of Transnet was it ever disclosed to you that there was a – a variation order that was already signed to this amount?     Yes.  Then you may proceed.  That is now after you have met with Mr  Silinga on 12 October 2016 what happens?    Yes.    Subsequent to that?    Proceed.    And what was the outcome of that meeting?  Did they produce any report subsequently?     Yes.  Was there any other subsequent engagement with Transnet?     Yes.  Now from paragraph 40 you refer to a letter which you received from Mr  Silinga.  Can you take us through the contents of same there on paragraph 11?  What was he conveying to the main shareholders?      And did the minority shareholders react to this letter.       Now flowing from that discussion with the Chair Mr Gonsalves I mean let us assume for the moment that there shareholders differences were amicably resolved within the consortium itself what would justify Transnet from not investigating ho w this amount escalated from 9.7, 280 647 000 being an SOE?     And then what happened after she, after the call. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Roberto, ja.    That is good Chair.    Roberto Gonsalves.    No, I do not.    Yes, I do.    So help me God.    (duly sworn, states)    Is that the statement that you are referring to Counsel?   Correct Counsel.    Yes it is Counsel.    On 14 April 2019.    Yes, I do.    Counsel I am Chartered Accountant.  I –if you want some more background about …     Okay.    Okay.  Chair my name is Roberto Gonsalves but I am known as Robbie  Gonsalves throughout the file you will see.  I am a Chartered Accountant.     The spelling is correct.    Gonsalves.  No you pronounce it.    Chair I am a Chartered Accountant.  I joined Cadiz Corporate Solutions in – towards the end of 1998.  Prior to that I was with Pricewaterhouse and I left PricewaterhouseCoopers as a Partner in 1998.  I have been with – I was with the Cadiz Group for over 20 years.  The Managing Director of the Corporate Advisory Business called Cadiz Corporate Solutions and then in January this year Cadiz Corporate Solutions was acquired by the Mergence Group and we are known as Mergence Corporate Soluti ons today but you will see throughout the evidence the reference to Cadiz Corporate Solutions.    That is absolutely correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Sure.  Chair I think it is well known that in July 2012 Transnet issued an open tender for the 1  064 locomotives – 1 064 locomotives – and that was split into 465 diesel locomotives and 599 electric locomotives.  We formed – Cadiz Corporate Solutions formed part of a consortium with China North Railways – CNR.  I must just clarify one thing.  CNR and CSR subsequently merge in China and are known as CRRC but at that time it was CNR.  So the consortium was made up of CNR, Cadiz, Global Rail – another entity – and then Endinamix which was the BEE shareholder.    Go Chair, proceed.    Chair perhaps let me start off with the shareholding.    So the entity is – was known as CNR Rolling Stock South Africa.  It is quite a mouthful – CNRRSSA.  When the merger happened between CNR and CSR in China it became known as CRRC SA Rolling Stock.  So that was CRRCSARS which is als oanother mouthful.  I am probably going to refer to it as CRN South Africa.    So that we know that that is the local entity through which CNR operated in South Africa.     If you look at the shareholding in CNR South Africa 66 percent is held by CNR which is now CRRC.  30 percent held by Endinamix the BEE shareholder, 2 percent by Global Railway Africa and the other 2 percent by Cadiz Corporate Solutions. In terms of the Board of Directors of that company.  There are seven Directors.  Endinamix has one Director and a gentleman by the name of Lulamile Xate.  He is a Director on that Board as a Non -Executive Director.  Rowlen von Gericke a Non-Executive Director represents Global and then I represent Cadiz Corporate Solutions.  The other four Directors are Jeff Wang.  His Chinese is Jun  (?) Wang, but his English name is Jeff Wang.  There is another gentleman by the name of Tau Yu.  Tony Yu is his English name and then Feng Yu and Jun (?) Chow.  Feng Yu and Gang Chow are based in China.  So they have never ever attended meetings.  They have dialled in for all Board Meetings.  Jeff Wang is the Managing Director and Tony  Yu was the Financial Director.  I understand that he is about to be replaced or has been replaced. ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA    So Chair Endinamix owns 30 percent in    So Chair the companies operated throughJeff Wang who is a Managing Director and Tony  Yu as a Financial Director.Rowlen von Gericke, Lulamile Xate and myself are Non-Executive Directors.  So we are not involved in the operations whatsoever.  We have - we attend Board Meetings only and maybe have done one or two site visits as part – part of that Board Meeting.    Sure.  Chair so on 9 August 2012 the CNR Consortium - at that stage it was incorporated.  It was an unincorporated joint venture.  It was only incorporated once the tender was awarded.  So that was made up of CNR, Global Rail, End inamix and Cadiz.  They informed Transnet that they would tender for both the electric and the diesel locomotives.  I understand that CNR wasprobably of the four OEMs probably the only party capable of manufacturing both the diesel and the electric locomo tives.  Then on 30 April 2013 Chair CNR Consortium submitted a tender to Transnet for both diesel and the electric locomotives and then on – I think – it is 17 April the tender was actually awarded to – to CNR South Africa for 232 diesel locomotives.  I th ink in my statement in paragraph 13 that is a slight error Chair.  Where it says …     I think it is probably 17  March 2014 Chair.    Correct, 17 March 2014.    Yes, (intervenes).    Yes.  I just wanted to inform the Chair that of the 465 diesel locomotives 232 were awarded to CNR South Africa.  The other 233 went to General Electric.     In paragraph 13 it says Bombardier.  So that is an error.  Bombardier was based in Bayhead with CNR.  That iswhere the confusion came in.    General Electric.    Chair this the local – Locomotive Supply Agreement - the LSA - that was executed on 17 March 2014.    Chair the agreement was signed – the Locomotive Supply Agreement – was signed by Transnet on 17 March 2014 and it was signed by Brian Molefe as the Chief Executive Officer and it was signed by CNR by Jeff  Wang/Wang Gang on 17 March 2014.    Sure.  Chair when the price was being built up for the – for the tender in respect of the 232 diesel locomotives it has always been done on the basis that the locomotives were going to be assembled and manufactured in Koedoespoort in Pretori a and you    Chair I will read it. “Delivery point means the delivery point in relation to the locomotives, spares, tool or test equipment as applicable namely the depot at Koedoespoort  Gauteng, the depot at Bayhead Durban or such other location in South Africa as maybe agreed between the contractor and the company from time to time.” So Chair my understanding of that is when you deliver completed locomotives you have got to deliver it s omewhere that is going to be in relation to where the contractor facility was.  So my understanding is that because the contractor facility had been moved to Bayhead delivery to – of those locomotives was going to take place at Durban as well – Bayhead Durban.   So Chair I think I am repeating what I say in the Locomotive Supply Agreement – the LSA – stipulated that the contractor facility was going to be either Koedoespoort or Bayhead.  However we knew that when – by the time that the LSA was signed that the contractor facility was going to be at Bayhead and I think theimportant thing is that all the calculations had been done on the basis initially that the contractor facility was going to be at Koedoespoort.  In early March so just a couple of days or two weeks or so even less than two weeks before the Locomotive Supply Agreement was signed Transnet indicated that we had to give them an impact of manufacturing and assembling in – in Bayhead Durban as opposed to Koed oespoort in Pretoria and we obviously sat down with CNR Consortium to calculate what the impact was on the price that was submitted for manufacturing and assembling in Bayhead Durban as opposed to Koedoespoort Pretoria.    Chair that is absolutely correct.  I meanwe were not even at the stage – this is prior to 17 March – we had not even signed the tender documents yet.  So the company had not even been incorporated.  So there were no physical premises.  We were not based in Koedoespoort.  We were not based anywhere.  We were still preparing the tender documents.    Absolutely correct.  Physically there was nothing to relocate.    Chair this document is written by the CNR Consortium Unincorporated Joint Venture and signed by Rowlen von Gericke on behalf of the CNR Consortium and it is addressed to Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe at the Commodity Manager S upply    Correctly Chair.  The offices are here.  A lot of the supplies are based up in Johannesburg.  The preference would have been Koedoespoort as to – as supposed to BayheadDurban.      Yes Chair in summary the CNRConsortium made up of CNR, Endinamics, Global and Kay dee’s applied or tendered for to manufacture both Diesel and Electric locomotives, they were ultimately awarded a contract for 232 diesel locomotives.  Prior to submitting the final tender price TFR requested that we give them an analysis of the increase i n costs for us manufacturing at Bayhead in Durban as opposed to Kuduspoort in Pretoria where we had originally assumed we were going to be manufacturing assembling and based our initial tender prices on.     No Chair that is correct, the preference on the CNR Consortium was to manufacture at Kuduspoort rather than Bayhead in Durban.      Chair I think that there four OEM’s and they wanted to split the manufacturing between two locations, Kuduspoort and Durban, so two OEM’s had to get Durban, Bayhead in Durban and we were selected as one of the parties, together with Bombardier, to manufacture and assemble at Bayhead in Durban and the other two CSR and General Electric got Kuduspoort.      Chair we were at that stage where we were just tendering, so we hadn’t commenced operations at all.       Thank you counsel.  Chair page 182 isa letter from CNR Consortium si gned by Rowlen von Gericke, this isn’t a signed version but it was signed by Rowlen von Gericke, this is just printed off an email and it’s addressed to TFR and it’s in connection     So Chair what we did is we calculated the additional cost of manufacturing in Bayhead as opposed to Kuduspoort and the total amount was R9.7million, the exact amount isR9 755 600, so what we informed TFR the additional cost for the full 232 locomotives, not per locomotive, would be R9.7million for us having to now manufacture and assemble in Bayhead Durban as opposed to Kuduspoort, Pretoria.     Okay Chair it says the above costs only relate to the measurable financial implications.  Please  bear in mind that there will always be considerable amount of immeasurable financial losses that may be – that will be incurred due to the relocation to Durban.Furthermore it will be very inconvenient and counterproductive to split our resources between  Johannesburg and Durban.  For these reason we request that the manufacturing should be done at Kuduspoort, knowing the Kuduspoort facility I was wonder, this is Rowlen von Gericke, I was wondering whether it will be possible to utilise the old Kuduspoort East Foundry Facility.  The CNR Consortium is of the opinion that the project can be better managed and executed in the Kuduspoort facility given its proximity to the existing offices.      That’s correct counsel.      Correct Chair.    That’s correct Chair.      Paragraph 18?      Okay, so we said the calculation ...(intervention)       Ja Chair I think it’s paragraph 18, the calculation of the extra cost relating to relocation from Kuduspoort toBayhead was performed by us as the consortium members, that is CNR, Endinamics, Global and Kaydees, we took the cost like transportation, flights, office and accommodation etcetera into consideration.  The revised costs also took into consideration the savings that would arise, that is important to Durban and not Pretoria meant less transport costs.      Chair that’s correct, certain costs would be saved so the transportation costs from Durban to Pretoria would besaved.     Chair that 9.7 is the total additional cost so there were some additional costs and there’s some savings.  So we took the additional costs, flights, accommodation, etcete ra, etcetera, the savings on transportation we deducted from that, to arrive at a net increase in cost of 9.7million which we took into account in determining our final bid price.     Okay, in summary Chair on the 23 r d of April 2015 CNR SA, that’s the South African entity, signed a contractwith a company called BEX and that company, that comes later on as Annexure 8, so I don’t know if counsel you want me to go into that already.    Okay so on 23 r d of April 2015 a signed contract with BEX, registration number 2009/028420/07 to act as an intermediary to negotiate a claim from Transnet for the relocation from Kuduspoort to Bayhead.        Chair BEX was not known to us at all until April 2015, it was the first time we heard the name.       Chair not at all, BEX wasn’t involved whatsoever.      Chair not whatsoever no.      Sure, Chair so what happened is on the – we received an email from the directors of the – the executive directors if you like of CNR South Africa with a resolution that they had already signed dated 8 t h of April 2015 and that resolution required the minority directors, that’s Rowlen von Gericke, Lulamile Xate and myselfto sign a resolution appointing effectively BEX as an agent for the company to negotiate the contract, the relocation claim with Trans net.        Chair we absolutely expressed that we were dissenting directors, we haven’t signed the resolution, refused to sign the resolution and at countless board meetings we raised the same issue and reminded them that we hadn’t approved that resolution to appoint BEX as their agent.      So Chair that’s precisely one of the reasons why we refused to appoint BEX or sign any resolution becausein our minds we had already been remunerated or reimbursed for the relocation, additional relocation costs involved in manufacturing at Bayhead as opposed to Kuduspoort, we couldn’t see any basis for any claim from Transnet for a relocation allowance or relocation cl aim.     Sorry counsel which paragraph?     From paragraph 22, ja, sure.  So as I mentioned Chair we were emailed a draft BEX agreement which was dated the 8 t h of March 2015 and that’s Annexure  5 in the file.  I would like to point out Chair that the ...(intervention)     Chair the agreement was 8 t h of March but we received it on the 8 t h of April, yes.    Sure, I think Chair the important thing is if you look at Annexure 5 and that draft agreement that is presented to us it was with an entity called BEX Structured Products.     That is absolutely correct Chair.    Sure, so Chair it’s important to note that it says Beck Structured Products Pty Limited and it’s got a registration number of 2000, we will see later in Annexure 8 that the actual agreement signed with another entity, not the same entity, very similar name, had a 2009 registration number and we believed that there’s a real BEX company that exists and we were given folders and files of work that they had done, but the BEX agreement that they actually signed was a dormant company which we will cover later on in my testimony.    So Chair when we were presented with this you will see why we couldn’t’ support it.  In this agreement with BEX there’s a paragraph 7.2  and if I may read it out, the fee that BEX requested for providing these services in terms of the agency agreement was the company agrees that BEX will be entitled for an Agency commission equivalent to the difference between the price excluding VAT awarded to the company by TFR and the price    More than half.    More than half ja.    So in paragraph 22.2 it’s what I already repeated that we received this partially signed Round Robin resolution signed by the CRC directors requesting that we sign it, the minority directors sign it and the resolution is “in order to  enter the agency agreement in relation to the relocation of the manufacturing facility.”     We we absolutely refused to sign it and in a nutshell the company went ahead and signed an agreement with BEX on the basis that they had four directors on the Board and controlled the Board.    Chair what I was attempting to illustrate here was that only on the meeting, at the meeting of the 10 t h of April 15 but I’ve got extracts of minutes of th e meeting on the 8 t h of October 2015 and also on the 6 t h of May 2016, and perhaps I could just maybe read out some parts of it to demonstrate how we felt about this.  From the minutes and that’s on page Chair 209 ...(intervention)     5.2 on page 209.   Yes.    Chair that’s correct, so the amount 9.7 which we had already received effectively in the pricing for the locomotives had now ballooned to 647million and what is quite ironic I think is that that the R647million is very close to the R650million that BEX, the first draft BEX agreement referred to as an example for their fee where they said R650million minus R280million benchmark gi ves us a R370million fee.    Well Chair they just couldn’t give us satisfactory answers and neither could Transnet and you will see later on why we reported this to the Hawks.    Counsel could I just on that point on page 2.4 ...(intervention)     I just wanted to refer to the minutes of  the 6 t h of May 2016 if I may.    So Chair you will see on page 214 item 9 which refers to resolution number 8 and the third bullet point it says the SA directors requested a copy of the BEX  report submitted to TFR made it clear that we as the shareholders have not approved the BEX contract so I think the important as well is that even though there was a Board resolution you will see later on we thought as shareholders in the company that it required a shareholders resolution as well because it was out of the ordinary course of the business as stipulated in the MI of the company.    So I think Chair I have already covered this slightly but the important thing is that despite the objections they controlled the board, the SRRC directors, the CNR directors and theywent ahead and signed the contract with BEX on the 23 r d of April 2015 and you will note that that BEX entity that they signed, which is Annexure 8, is signed with a company called Business Expansion Structured Products Pty Limited so it’s not the original entity, the BEX Structured Products Pty Limited and the registration of this company is a 2009 company registration as opposed to the BEX structured products with a 2000 registration number.    That’s quite correct Chair.    Chair this is the actual agreement signed, you will see signed with Business Expansion Structured Products which they refer to as BEX and its dated April 25 2015.     So Chair you will see that this company never operated, it had a turnover of less than R5million, it  was effectively a dormant company.  However in this agreement signed between BEX and CRSA in the introduction it says BEX a professional service advisory business that specialises in business enterprise ontooptimisation using financial modelling, derivatives and engineering techniques with its long subsisting relationships in the territory of South Africa and it goes on and on.  Obviously as a dormant company it had no activities and had never done anything.     Absolute incorrect Chair.    Sorry counsel which page?    222?    Yes I am thank you.    So Chair under 6.2 so the initial contract had had a benchmark of R280million and the fee was anything above R280million, this changed to R580million and I will read it out.  So here it says the company agrees that BEX will be entitled to an agency commission equivalent to the difference between the price excluding VAT awarded to the company by TFR and a project benchmark cost of R580million excluding VAT.  For example if the price awarded is R680million then BEX will be entitled to an agency commission ofR100million excluding VAT, that is R680million less R580million.  The next paragraph says the company will be entitled to the project benchmark cost of R580million irrespective of whether the total project value is negotiated lower than the R680millio n by TFR.     So it is quite interesting to see that the benchmark had changed from R280 to R580 for starters and I think that probably had a lot to do with the pressure  that the minority shareholders and directors put on them but irrespective it still talksabout, refers to a potential fee of R100million to a company called BEX that is a dormant company.    Chair we do so if we can it’s on Annexures 9 and 10 so the first one perhaps on page 229, this was at that board meeting, I think it was on the 8 t h of April or the 10 t h of April 15, this was presented to us sort of by the Chinese directors, and it’s BEE verification certificate of exemption for micro enterprises, so this is for Business Expansion Structured Products Pty Limited and it says at the bottom you will see “company identification status exempt micro enterprise” that is turnover of R5million and below and then if you look at Annexure 10 which is page 231 we’ve got core 14.3 from CIPC, certificate of confirmation and here we will see there’s th e activedirectors of the company is one Mark Shaw and Mark Shaw was appointed by the company on the 15 t h of April 2015, so it seemed that the company as established sometime in 2009 as a dormant company and on the 15 t h of April 2015 Mark Shaw was appointed as a director and on the 25 t h of April this company signed the agency agreement with CNR South Africa.    Correct, initially the fee of 370million but it was changed down to 100million.    Ja so I think it goes to the point that BEX was entitled to a fee of anything over R280 million.  For starters we did not know where the R280 million came from.  On the 21 April 2015 the company emailed us a calculation which is attached as Annexure 11 showing us calculations for supporting an amount of R287 million.  At that stage obviously we had not even seen.  When we saw the BEX contract an amount referred to of R280 million we had no i dea where that amount had come from.    And on the 21 April for the first time we saw some calculations supporting an amount of R287 million.    Chair it is on pages 233 to 235.    So unfortunately it is a long A3 page it is sort of printed in three A4 pages.  But you will see quite  an amateurish document that says for example point1 increase logistics costs R45  100 million.  Then increased cost for set up facilities in Durban and traveling R27 300 million etcetera.  And there are eight line items and the total of that line item is R287 million and some change.   And Chair if I may just add what I find fascinating is this was emailed to us by the company claiming that the relocation claim should be R287 million.  But ultimately Transn et paid them R647 million which is even more absurd.     Chair R9.7 million.    So Chair ja our – we increased the tender price by 9.7 million for all 232 locomotives.     The company submitted something forR287 million.    And that is obviously when they entered into the initial – when they had discussions with BEX initially and the draft agreement we got referred to a benchmark of R280 million.  So it seems that this is where the R280 million came from.     And so this is their own calculation sent by the company of a potential claim that they thought they  had of R287 million but ultimately Transnet paid R647 million to the company.    That is quite correct Chair.    Absolutely Chair.  I mean you can see on pages 233 to 235 a very poorly constructed schedule supporting an amount of R287 million.    Chair I – I have no doubt that when thecompany arrived at Bayhead they may have found that the facility maybe is not what they expected and thought that they – there was an amount that they could possibly claim.  If that was the case it would be very easy to prove what it is and Transnet should have given us the answers and said, the company is entitled to a claim for this specific reason.  For example maybe this p iece of equipment does not exist and we said it did exist and so we need to – you had to acquire the equipment yourself so we now need to reimburse you.  But nothing of that sort happened. So I cannot see any justification when we submitted a fixed final price that included an amount for relocation aswe had calculated together with CNR of R9.7 million and included that in the final price of the locomotives how we were entitled to anything?  Bearing in mind that we are shareholders in the company.  We would  love to get a reimbursement of an amount.  We just could not see any justification for it.      Sure so Chair what actually happened is that a contract was signed it is in Annexure 12 on page 238 and this was a contract signed between CNR, South Africa and TFR in respect of this relocation allowance or claim.  It was signed in July 2015 and Counsel I do not know if you want me to go into the amounts now?     Sure.    So – Chair then on page 239 you will see that the claim now has gone – moved from this R287 million that we were referring to to an amount of R719 million and then CNR are quite gracious in offering a settlement discount of 10% amounting to R71 million to TFR and that the nett amount…     Sure.  So…     Chair we have requested that from TFR.     Transnet already and from CNR.    And no one has given us a satisfactoryanswer.    So Chair this is the agreement that was eventually signed between CNR South Africa and TFR in respect of the relocation allowance and you will see that it was signed by Jeff on page 249, by Jeff Wang on behalf of CNR and by Anoj Singh on behalf ofTransnet.  The version that we have in this file is only being say – signed by Jeff Wang we do not have the version tha t was signed by Anoj Singh as well.    Correct Chair you will see later on that Siyabonga Gama confirms that this is accepted.     So Chair going back to page 239 if I may?  You will see in the first – at the bottom of the first paragraph the cost has now ballooned from this 9.7 to the R287 million to now R719 million and…    Sure.    So Chair I will read the first twoparagraphs under the Executive Summary.  “We have been requested to analyse the cost increase for the locomotive delivery and locomotive factory relocation in terms of manufacturing facility relocation for Class 45D locomotive supply project.  The decision to relocate from Pretoria, Gauteng to Durban KwaZulu Natal will cost an estimated R719 million but the precise amount is R719  090 548.00.  Of this amount we are happy  to offer settlement discount of % amounting to R71  909 054.00 therefore the reduced amount due to CNR after deducting the settlement discount amounts to R647 million – R647 million the exact amount R647 181 494.00.”    So ja so Counsel you are quite correct.  Chair the amount went from 9.7 to an email that we got supporting R287 million which seems to tie in with the initial draft BEX contract  where there is a benchmark of R280 million and then this ballooned to R719 million but CNR was so gracious as to give a 10% discount to TFR so that the amount reduced to R647 million.     Ja I think what we mentioning here is that the – as alluded to earlier on is that the benchmark in the first draft BEX contract alluded to an amount of – referred to an amount of R280 million and in the signed contract with BEX I am using the term BEX loosely because there were two different companies with two different registration numbers but that amount – that benchmark then increased to R580 million.    So…    If you go to Annexure 8 I think it is Chair you will see under the fee section it should be Clause 6.     222.    I think 222 is the best page.    Ja 222.    Correct.    Sure Chair.      Chair I think it is possibly a capacity issue. There is only so many locomotives that can be manuf actured.  So if you have got two facilities I know that they wanted to expedite the production of the locomotives.  So if you could only make for example 12 locomotives in a month in one facility say in Koedoespoort if you split it between Koedoespoort in Bayhead you could make 24 locomotives in a month.  So it would be expedited that was one reasonI know that they mentioned.  The other reason that was mentioned was just a transfer of skills.  Having skills in both Koedoespoort and Bayhead to manufacture locomotives so you would have the skills in two different locations.    Chair obviously we were not involved inTransnet’s decision making.    I do understand that there may be an argument why he would want to split it and di versify a risk from a geographic perspective.    Skills transfer not having all your risk in one facility if something had to go wrong at Koedoespoort.     It was just given to us.    Chair if …    Correct Chair.   Mr Chair…    Chair absolutely not.  So the decision was made that CNR South Africa had to manufacture and assemble in Bayhead.  It was done.  We increased the price that we bid on the locomotives by R9.7 million taking into account the additional cost and some of the savings and we were – it was paid for in built-in in a fixed price contract.  Even if the amount was R287 million had ballooned to R287 million from R9 million which I think sounds abs urd by any stretch of imagine we had no basis for a claim in my mind and until someone could justify that and show us we – you know we just could not accept it.   No Chair it is I mean – it may sound absurd for a shareholder to turn around and say we do not want the R647 million that we have paid we do not believe we are entitled to it but that is precisely what we did.     Chair I think you hit the nail on the head.     So if it was a proper claim and it had justification for it we would have been happy.     And the only way we could find out was to approach Transnet and say this is what we have been paid R647 million.  If we are entitled to it fantastic.  We still got a problem with the BEX issue but that is another issue.  But are we entitled to the R647 million, can you help us in that respect?    Sure.  So perhaps Chair I can just read this because I think it is quite important.     “It was not clear to us as the minority non -executive CRRC directors why having negotiated the term…”     Sure so Chair I will start again.   “It was not clear to us as the minority non -executive CRRC directors why having negotiated the terms of  an agreement with Transnet as extensive and complex as a locomotive supply agreement and despite having access to considerable rail rolling experience with the shareholder base CNR South Africa nevertheless felt it necessary to appoint an intermediary such as BEX which appears to have been a newly formed company with no trading history and little or no background in assembly, manufacture, maintenance or operation oflocomotives or any other experience in the rail industry to negotiate a second directly related agreement [which we subsequently noted was referred to a variation order with Transnet and furthermore to do so on such significantly generous terms to BEX.”    Sure.  So Chair this is a document signed on the 23 July 2015 by the acting Group E xecutive Siyabonga Gama of Transnet and it is addressed to Jeff Wang of CNR and in summary what the letter says is that it serves to confirm the acceptance of the variation order of the amount of R647 million of which the proposed payment terms was 50% pay able within fourteen days which is R323 million and I am rounding the numbers and 50% payable in 24 equal instalments of R13.4 million.  Chair if I may just add on my paragraph 28?  What we – what I was referring to there is that the locomotive supply agreement is a document of over 500 pages and it took weeks on end to negotiate.  A similar document was negotiated with Transnet Engineering also over 500 pages. This was done within the consortium we had lots of experience especially amongst the BE partners.  We had Azon Rail there.  We had a guy called Julius Nobanda from Nanetta, Linontando. We had Global Railwith tons of rail experience.  Women in Rail. You had Kadies Asalves.  We had negotiated all these agreements.  We now had a possible claim from Transnet related to these agreements why did they not engage with us, why did they not inform us, why did they not let us do the calculations if there was a calculation? Why would they appoint a company BEX that has got no trading history that has never traded  and pay them ultimately an amount of R67 million but at one stage could have possibly been an amount of R370 million.      Ja so I think Chair what we are saying is BEX is a dormant company. They absolutely have no experience in this.  They do not know anything about the local supply agreement.  They were not involved in any of the negotiations on the rel ocation to Bayhead etcetera.  Within our consortium the reason why CNR selected us as a consortium was because of the extensive experience that many of the partners in the consortium had in the rail industry.  Why would they not turn to us and say we think  we have got a possible claim from Bayhead for whatever reason from Transnet for the relocation to Bayhead we do not believe that we do but let us assume that there was a basis for it can you assist us in putting together some calculation orformulate a claim for us?  Instead they turned around to a company called BEX that is as we know a dormant company ten days earlier they appointed the director, no trading history etcetera.  That just does not make commercial sense whatsoever.    So Chair if I can take you I think it is Annexure 12 or 13.    Annexure 10.   Annexure 10 no, no sorry.    Ja you will see…     231 yes.    One director Mark Shaw appointed on the 15 April 2015.  The BEX agreement was signed on the 25 April 2015.  So one director seemingly.    No Chair.  The only light I can shed on here is on the – in the first agreement put in front of us the Annexure 5 agreement I am going to call it which is the BEX structured products that 2000 company I believe that such a company does exist andeffectively if I may use the term they hijacked the credentials of this company and put a doc ument in front of us that purported to show that BEX had experience in similar activities.  The reality is that when we asked for the documents and they brought us the documents by that time the agreements had already been signed and so there was almost we could do.  When they showed us the Sipsey document and the BE Certificate document it did not take – it took a few seconds to realise that this was a sham company and said so right in front of them.  Gentlemen do you realise that there is one director tha t is just recently been appointed and this company has never traded. It has got a turnover less than R5 million.  Obviously they could not respond in any meaningful way to that.    So Chair certainly when they presented us at the board meeting with these documents and we counted immediately when we saw that it was affectively a dormant company, a sham company they – they never defended it in any way.  They n ever expressed any shock in any way.  I kind of sensed that they were aware what they were dealing with or who they were dealing with.     So Chair the benefit to them was that BEX acting as an agent was able to procure R647 million from Transnet which they claim that they could not and for B EX to be able to facilitate that BEX got paid an amount of R67 million.  So remember that what their claim was at one stage R280 million.  Let us just – let us assume that it is a correct calculation done by the company they ultimately receive R647 million through the assistance of BEX and for that BEX was paid R67 million.    Chair that is the million dollar question. That is precisely the same question we asked.     Chair we could not agree more with you.     No.  Chair we – we demanded a few times …    That we meet with BEX.     That was never forthcoming …     For obvious reasons.    We asked the question of them have you ever met with BEX.  They claimed that they had met with BEX.     So we demanded the same thing.  Wewant to see CVs, credentials …     Etcetera.  None of that ever – we never received any of that.    Ja.  So I think page 29 – paragraph 29 we are saying that even though the variation order is financially beneficial.  We think that the Locomotive Supply Agreement already envisages that we – the operations are going to be at Bayhead and it is a fix price contract and an amount of R9.7 million has already been included for all 232 locomotives.  So we cannot see how we are entitled to any amount.   Okay, Chair.    Understood.    Chair I think you would – to – to negotiate that one would have – need quite a bit of rail experience especially experience in the manufacturing and assembly of – andunderstand what the basis of the claim could be.  Does it relate to logistics?  Does it relate to training?  Does it relate to the facilities, the equipment etcetera?  So one would hav e to be pretty knowledgeable about the rail industry and manufacturing and supply chain – you know – processes to be able to calculate an amount.     Ja.  Chair so even though CNR hadsigned the agreement with BEX we thought we would let them know that we thought this is outside the ordinary course of business and in terms of the Memorandum of Incorporation it requires 70 percent of the shareholders to agree on a transaction on agreement and because CNR holds 66 percent of the shares 30 percent held by (indis tinct), 2 percent by Global and 2 percent by Cadiz that if we could elevate this to a shareholder level we would vote against it …     And their response was we have taken legal opinion that this is in ordinary course of business.    Chair that is correct.  They knew that the minority Directors already voted no at the Board level and if it went to ashareholder meeting they would vote in the same way.  So they would only get 66 percent and not 70 percent and therefore they would not get the shareholder resolution signed.     So Chair this is the MOI – the Memorandum of Incorporation – for CNR Rolling Stock South Africa.    So Chair this is a clause out of the MOI and these are all the issues - and there are 30 of them – that require if you like the majority of the share holders to approve and 4.1.3.27 has    Chair that is quite correct.  That is included as Annexure 16 from – on page 267.    So Chair the – the letter is dated 8 June 2016.  That is when the last person signed it and it is addressed to the Board of Directors of CNR and to the moth er company – CRRC. It is quite important.  So we also sent it to China and the heading is “The Appointment of BEX Expansion Structured Products (Pty) Ltd”.  There are 19 points in the letter. I thought if I may just highlight which I thought     Are the relevant points.    So in paragraph 4 of that letter I read    Chair not – not in any means whatsoever and that is sort of being typical of their behaviour whenever we raised an issue there has been on response.     Absolutely Chair.  So on 16  August 2016 Rowlen von Gericke …     Page 9 ja.  So on 16 August 2016 Rowlen von Gericke from Global together with Stan  Whiting from Global, Lulamile Xate representing Endinamix and I representing Cadiz we met with Siyabonga Gama who is the Group Chief Executive Officerwith Garry Pita the Group Chief Financial Officer and we met with Ndiphiwe Silinga who is the Group Legal and Compliance Officer to discuss this.    Well what is quite interesting is that at that stage we had not seen the variation order that had already been signed by Anoj Singh and we had not seen the acceptance letter of the variation order signed by Siyabonga  Gama as well.  So we went into that meeting just raising our issues about the BEX contract, how it was entered into, the amount that was claimed and what our belief was thatthere was no commercial substance to it.     Correct.    Absolutely.    So …    Sure.    So Chair we raised two issues.  One was that the relationship between the minority shareholders and CNR was not ideal.  Mainly because of corporate governance issues.     That the Chinese did not seem to understand that we took corpor ate governance seriously and so that was the one issue.   And you will see it is referred to later on in …    In the papers …     And then the second issue was BEX.  We said that the company wants to engage or has engaged with BEX and to pay them a fee in respect of the relocation allowance.  We do not believe that we are entitled to a relocation allowance.  We may be missing something.  There may be something in the locomotive supply agreement which is a 500 page document that entitles us to a claim …     That we are not aware of.  Was Transnet aware of this claim?    Do they know whether we are entitled to an amount?  Can they justify the amount?     So perhaps we do not have the problem with the amount that is being claimed from Transnet and then we have only got a problem with BEX.    Their response was surprise from – from Transnet’s perspective.   With hindsight there should not have been any surprise but you will see why and – I mean – there was even a comment I think that the CEO made that this alarming because perhaps a similar amount could have been paid to other OEMs …     And said therefore this had to be investigated.    We told them that (intervenes).    No.  So look we – so let us maybe clarify the relocation.  So …    R9.7 million was an increase in the price - in the tender price because manufacturing no longer was going to be at Koedoespoort based on our initial tender calculations and it was going to be at Bayhead …     And once that was agreed to and – and formulated into the final pricing …     It was signed on a fixed price contractbasis.    So we told them - that is exactly what we told them.    So we did not think that we were entitled to an amount.    But we also said that it is possible …     That we are entitled to an amount and we just do not know what the basis of that amount is and how it is calculated and on what basis in the legal agreements we  can claim that amount …    And perhaps we had missed something …     And it was a simple response – a simple answer and someone can refer us to the Locomotive Supply Agreement and say in terms of Clause 32 or whatever it is you are entitled to a relocation allowance under these circumstances.     So we asked them please provide that to us and they undertook that they would look into it and they r equested us to give them copies of all the documents which we did subsequentlyyou will see.    I think it comes later on.  I do not – at that stage I think we were still talking about the term of R80 million.     Absolutely not.  They said they would investigate it.    That is correct Chair.   Ja.  So Chair we assumed when we left the meeting we assumed that they were not aware of  this.    That is the impression that we got.     But we can see from the evidence that …     The variation – acceptance of the variation order had already been signed …     By the CEO.    Yes but we had not seen it.    That is correct Chair.    Correct Chair, correct.    So the …    The variation order was signed by Anoj Singh …    And the acceptance of the variati on order was signed by Siyabonga  Gama.  So we can refer that to (intervenes).     Chair that is quite correct.    Ja.  Chair that is quite correct.  If you go to page 261 …   Ja correct.Chair the date is23 July 2015 …    And our meeting with the Transnet Executives was on 16 August 2016.    Huh-uh.           The 16 t h.    2016.  So it is a year almost – more than a year later.    Correct.    Correct.  Correct Chair.    So Chair you will see in my statement a couple of things happened.  So after we met we – with – with the Executives in person on 16  August on 13 September 2016 - and that is paragraph 35.    We physically met with Ndiphiwe Silinga and handed him 84 pages of documents around the BEX issue that we had and …    All the BEX issues …     Most of the documents that …     That we had at that stage relating to BEX.    Minutes …    (Indistinct) documents etcetera.    Hm.    Chair that is quite correct.    And then Ndiphiwe Silinga called me on 12 October 2016 and informed me that they were conducting two audits – internal audits and the one – to find out two things.  One why Transnet Engineering had not been paid part of the R647 million.   So Transnet Engineering is a subcontractor …     To CNR South Africa.    They build the bodies and the bogies …     Of the build price.    So what he was implying was that if CNR South Africa was entitled to a claim of R647 million …     Then Transnet Engineering maybe was entitled as a subcontractor …     To a portion of that amount …     And his other question was – so at this stage I must just correct myself.  We knew it was 647 million.  It was not 280.  We are talking about 647 million.     Because this 2016 – is how the four – R647 million was arrived at as they thought it had looked like certain amounts had been duplicated.  That was a telephonic discussion we had with him.    Then not a lot until …    A male.    647 million, quite correct.    Then on …    So on that – we met on 16 August 2016.    On 13 September 2016 we met with them again.    Ja.    And we gave them all the physicalinformation …    And then we had the conversation on 12 October 2016 where they informed us that they were doing this – these investigations.    Correct.    Thank you Chair. Chair absolutely not.We only discovered that later on.  We got that from Hogan Lo vells later on.    So on 12 October Mr Silinga called me and – that is the – and informed me about the  two audits.    That they were doing.    And subsequent to that on 8  DecemberMr Silinga informed us that – he sent us an email saying that Transnet has appointed Harold Jacobs of Werksmans to investigate the BEX matter and that Mr Jacobs would be contacting us for interviews.   And what happened is on 14 December 2016 we met with Werksmans  team and shared all the information that we had on the BEX matter with them.     No.  They – they were – we kept onasking them where they were progressing.  I think the next contact with them is we sent them an email at the end of January  2017 asking them what the status was of the investigations and they – they stated that it was ongoing.    A few times we – we would have phoned Mr Silinga just to find out what the status was, whether we could assist them in anyway, how the investigations were progressing.     So that is Annexure 18.  So what happened was initially the company requested that Lulamile  Xate sign aletter that the company addressed to Transnet. In the initial draft that they put in front of Lulamile there was a reference in there that we had resolved the BEX matter an d Lulamile refused to sign it and had it removed, and then signed the letter, and the letter basically said that the relationship between CNR and the minority shareholders seem to be improving, they were getting a better understanding and appreciate of what we meant by corporate governance and that we had directors fiduciary duties and responsibilities. In response to that letter Mr Silinga sent us a letter which is attached I think on page 277 ...(intervention)       Correct.  And in – what Mr Silinga requests it says, in essence the letter seems to advise that all differences between the shareholders of CNR Rolling Stock Sout h Africa have been resolved and there now exists a good working      Chair we responded to the letter and we basically said we would like to remind you that there were two items that we raised in a meeting with you, the first i ssue relating to the relationship and cooperation between CNR and the shareholders, and we would like to report that significant progress has been in this     That’s quite correct Chair and wecontinued to request that they continue with the investigation.       Chair I think you’re absolute correct, I think the objective of the letter was to give Transnet grounds not t pursue the BEX matter any further.       Ja, remember that Chair that when we went to him them were two issues that we raised, one was shareholder issues and like the relationship wasn’t ideal and the second one was the BEX issue, and I think what ...(intervention)       I think there as a bit of a debate as to Chair whether we raised with Transnet or not, we just saw them as a significant stakeholder and we had a bit of impasse with CNR and we were trying to see whether Transnet could assist in that process and they made it clear Chair that they didn’t want to get involved.      Ja in the relationship and the shareholders issues, we had to resort that – sort that out ourselves.      Chair I would have thought it was a top priority and you will see that internally they said there was an investigation, I don’t know what the outcome of that is or was, an d then they requested Werksmans to do an investigation, I think ultimately Werksmans produced a report and I don’t know whether the BEX matter was dealt with in that report or not but certainly we were concerned at the pace at which you know developments w ere moving.      CNR South Africa?     KPMG.      Sir the only time that KPMG got involved was that we heard that there was a reportable irregularity in respect of this but we only heard that a bit later.       Mr Chair from a timeline perspective this is almost sort of six months later, I received a call from Daisy Zang, (indistinct) she is one of the employees at CNR South Africa and she mentioned to me that KPMG had informed them that they were considering issuing a report of irregularity and that report of irregularityif I can refer is the second RI, it’s the second Reportable Irregularity because unbeknown to us at that stage they had already reported on the BEX issue as a reportable irregularity.      So I called Fred Van Eckenstein, the KPMG partner, to find out about this reportable irregularity and on that call he mentioned to me that this wasn’t the first one that he had already issued a reportable irregularity and but obviously I didn’t know that was in connection with.     So Chair this letter is dated the 4 t h of September 2017, it’s a letter from Hogan Lovells addressed to KPMG, to the partner, Fred Van Eckenstein, and it’s a letter supporti ng why KPMG should not consider the BEX issue to be a reportable irregularity, so once KPMG had reported that this was a reportable irregularity, the BEX issue, the company then engaged Hogan Lovells to draft a response to KPMG and this is the response in Annexure 20.      Chair absolutely not, we had no knowledge at that stage that there was even a reportable irregularityand that Hogan Lovells had been engaged to report and work on – to respond to the reportable irregularity.       So on the 22 n d of September 2017 I wrote to Fred van Eckenstein, the KPMG partner, I thanked him for the call, I said that he had mentioned to me on the call that there was a previous reportable irregularity as well, I told him that none of the South African directors, myself, Lulamile Xate or Rowlen von Gerickewas aware of that and I asked him for – to give us any correspondence on it and that correspondence I subsequently got from Hogan Lovells and I requested a meeting with him as soon as possible between ourselves and the management of the company.  
ADV ZIYAAD MINTY:  Thank you very much Chair.  Good afternoon to you.    My name is Ziyaad Minty from the Johannesburg Bar …   On behalf of CNR and Mr  Jeff Wang instructed by Thomson Wilks.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Thank you Chair.  Mr Gonsalves just before the lunch adjournment you were still informing t he Chair about the request which was made to your consortium emanating from Transnet, if you can simply summarise what you were informing the Chair.     Yes.     Now fundamentally at that time when this request was made was there anything that had to be allocated, were there any operations taking place already in Kuduspoort?      May we request the Chair to make a big note on that amount of R9.7 because flowing from the evidence of this witness that amount changes drastically.  Now of importance Mr Gonsalves is what is being recorded immediately after the amount of R9.7, if you can read and comment on what is written therein.    And this accord with what you have informed the Chair earlier on about the view already taken by the Consortium.      Yes.     Now you may proceed, may I refer you to back to your statement, page four and begin to please summarise for us the contents of paragraph 8 and what follows thereafter.       18 yes.       To the statement yes.     Now if we may proceed to deal with a new topic, the agreement with BEX and please take us through what is stated in your paragraph 19 Chair on page 5.       Now what I want to know is that at thistime when now the name of BEX all of a sudden emerges do we know whether at the time when your consortium submitted a tender whether BEX as an entity was it part of that consortium?        Yes, and at the time when you submitted the relocation cost of R9.7 was BEX factored in at all?       ...and please summarise for us those aspects which you believe are paramount to your evidence.     Did you support that memorandum or what was there to be achieved through that document?        Yes, but I mean what is surprising what was to be discussed at the time if already there was an amount arrived at as a relocation fee, what was BEX supposed to do at the time?      Yes Chair back to the statement of the witness on page five, from paragraph 22 you set out the pertinent background facts in relation to the appointment of BEX, could you please summarise those for us.    Page 5 from paragraph 22.   Yes you were just about to refer – you wanted to say something about ...(intervention)     Chair that is on page 190.   Would that be correct Mr Gonsalves?     Yes, could you please repeat what you wanted to highlight to the Chair in relation to those names.     Yes, and let’s go back then to your paragraph 22.1 and just summarise what you convey therein.     Sjoe!    But even more we know that at the back of this information is the already affected amount of R9.7million, nowwe now see what is now being envisaged in the paragraph that you have just read to the Chair.  Alright, you may proceed then with what you are telling the Chair from paragraph 22.2 on onwards.     Yes.  Now what happened after you having received this document?     Yes, may I refer you to RG7, that isfolder number seven Chair, and if you may go to page 207  that’s where you locate it and please identify that document for the Chair.     Is it paragraph 5.2?    Yes, if you may then read for us.    Now this amount that we see here as 647million one can trace it back from the amount 9.7 which you say itwas already effected when the company you know conceded to the request of the relocation.    And the majority shareholders how did they justify receiving this money from Transnet in the light of what you actually told the Chair.    Yes now Chair back to the statement of the witness, if you may proceed Mr Gonsalves with what you’re stating from paragraph 22.5 on page 6, and please summarise for us what you’re conveying therein.    Yes, yes.    Oh yes, yes you may.   Yes, yes.  Now I was just about to refer you to paragraph 22.5 for you to proceed with the  evidence from that paragraph.    Yes.    Now will you please turn to RG8, you will find it from page 216, before I refer you to the relevant portions of that document could you please identify that doc ument?    This was false this was incorrect, this was false?    Now if I may refer you to page 222 of the same document.    222.    Yes, are you there?    If you can also take the Chair through paragraph 6.2 and 6.3 and comment on what is stated in those paragraphs.    This dormant company that you are talking about do you know as to whether did it have directors, how many ...(intervention)     And that’s the company that was going to be entitled to that huge amount of the relocation fee?     Yes, now may I refer you back to your statement and please take us from page seven paragraph 25 and please make us to understand the different amounts that ar e reflected therein and their significance.    Yes.    Maybe let us go to those calculations.  Chair it is RG11 to be found on page 233.      Yes.    Yes.    From an amount which you say it was R9.7 and it was already factored in – into the amount that was supposed to be paid to the consortium?     Now for now we are now sitting at an amount of R280 million which you are unable yourself to give meaning or sense to it as to how it was arrived at?     Ja may I refer you back to your statement?  Page 7 and proceed to deal with paragraph 26 because it appears that that amount for 280 does  not end there but for some reason it gets increased?     Yes let us go – maybe let us do that – letus align that with you – with Annexure RG12 on page 238.    Yes.    Page 239 Chair.   Chair 239.  Page 239 that is where the – That is where Mr Gonsalves is.  Mr Gonsalves while the Chair is shocked about those amounts could you please be slow and take us through the contents of 239?     239.    239 yes Chair.    But can you confirm that you are aware of the signed version which was signed on behalf of Transnet by Anoj Singh and on behalf of the consortium by Mr Jeff Wang?     Yes.      It is under the heading ‘Summary’ Chair?    Executive Summary.    And then thereafter you can comment about it so that at least we are able to follow y our evidence.    Yes.  And your comment on theseparagraphs bearing in mind the 9.7?     They were indeed gracious with that amount.  If you may refer back to page 7 of your statement and summarise the contents of paragraph 27 Mr Gonsalves.    Page 216 Chair.    Triple 2, 222.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    But could there have been a justification for the amount of 9.7 to become 280 and ultimately 647?     I mean surely as a shareholder would have loved that this money must be paid to your company to the consortium to benefit the consortium but in your clear conscience you say that there could not have been justification for the company to receive such amount from Transnet.     Yes.  May I refer you back to your witness statement with particular reference to page 8 and please if youmay comment from paragraph 28 and share with us what you are conveying in that paragraph and also paragraph 29?     Yes.    Page 8.   Paragraph 28.    While you are there may be let us complete that thought by referring  you to RG14 on page 261 and if you can identify the document and also summarise the contents of that document and please proffer your comment on it?    Page 231.    He might have been experienced Chair?     He might have been experie nced?    Yes.     Yes, but you did reproduce its contents from page 11, Chair contents are on page 11.      So it was clear and unambiguous that in as far as it related to the minority shareholders the issue pertaining to BEX was still alive and it was still persisting with the complaint.        Yes, and then what happened after this exchange of correspondence?       And do you know as to who were the auditors of the consortium at this stage?        Yes.      Were they engaged at any stage pertaining to these issues, I mean these are serious irregularities, this is serious matters of concern that were raised by the minority?      Yes can you deal then with your evidence from paragraph 42, page 12 Mr Chair.      Yes.  Now if I may refer you to RG20, it’s on page 281 Chair, it’s a very lengthy letter if you may identify that letter and summarise for the Chair what it  sought to convey and what was the purpose of that letter?      Yes, did the minority shareholders agree with the sentiments accord in that letter?       Ja, may I refer you back to your statement, page 12, and commence from paragraph 45 of your statement to share with us what you’re conveying in that paragraph.      Yes, Chair I see that it’s four o’clock, would this be an appropriate time to adjourn, even if we can start at ten tomorrow we should be able to deal and complete with the evidence of Mr Gonsalves and the other short witness that we might have.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKO ENA SC:   Yes, now may I refer you to foldernumber six, Chair it will be RRG6, on page 203.  If you can identify the document ...(intervention)  
GONSALVES:At least you could contin ue manufacturing in Bayhead etcetera.  So I understand that.  I was not – we were not involved in that. 
MR ROBERTO GONSLVES:  And they probably make up 25 percent …
