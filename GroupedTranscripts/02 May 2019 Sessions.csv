CHAIRPERSON:Good morning Ms September, good morning everybody.    Thank you.    Morning Major General Booysen.     Thank you.  We continue from where we left off?     I am sorry [not speaking into microphone]     Yes.    They have not replaced themselves on record yet? ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    Okay, alright let them place themselves on record?     Good morning.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you.  It is a – Mr Pretorius we – we need to reflect of what the implications are of the fact that the legal team of the commission is technically briefed by the state attorney as I understand it.  But the state attorney also represents some implicated persons.  I –that had not occurred to me.  It just occurs now.  I do not know whether you have had a chance to think about it but we will  need to reflect on it.  It may be – it may be that I should not be concerned but on the face of it it seems that it needs reflection.  Okay.     Yes.    Yes.ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC   That is fine.  Yes.    Yes, ja, that is fine.    H’m.    No, no, I understand that.  That is partly why I a m saying we need to reflect on it.    But equally we need to reflect on what dangers it might pose.    If…    Because a…    Ja because so to speak as I understand the position the state attorney becomes instructing attorneys to you people and an instructing attorney has access to certain things and in regard to counsel that they instruct and if they also instruct counsel who represents an implicated person what does that mean?  So we need toreflect on that as well.    Ja.    Ja.   Yes, yes.  Okay.    Thank you.  Is there another member?     Yes thank you.    Good morning.    Yes.    Brigadier?    Ncaba?    Okay thank you very much.    Okay thank you very much.    Thank you.   Oh yes it has been handed to – it was handed to me in the past few days.  I understand that to be the full report of the Mokgoro Inquiry?    Yes.    Thank you.  That will b e Exhibit ZG.    Thank you.    But we will not need it for today is it or will we?     Oh okay.  Alright thank you.    What page were we on the last time I thought I hadmarked but it does not look like I did?     Thank you.  Let me just check something before youproceed.  Okay thank you.    Major General Booysen have you got all the documents that we all have?     Thank you.      Just to refresh one’s memory.  What was the year of the bribery case again?     So for about eight years or so no disciplinary – well from what you say there was an attempt to take disciplinary action and he obtained an interdict and after that as far as you know nothing    H’m.    Yes.    He would be…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   H’m.    No it is the same oath continuous.     Because he had not finished his evidence.  It is different if he has finished and he comes back for cross -examination.    So you say you had raised the issue with the – in any event just to be on the safe side – in any event you confirm that you are still under oath that you had took previously and you will continue to give your evidence under the same oath?     Yes, yes thank you.  Now in terms of the people at SAPS or people within whatever structure internally to whom you had reported this for purposes of any disciplinary action are you able to say this is to whom I addressed correspondence or spoke – this is who Ispoke to and these would be the people who would have taken decisions or is that something that you are not able at this stage to indicate?    H’m, h’m.  And you do not know what happened ultimately with that interdict because an interdict will normally and I assume it was just a temporary interdict and you – from what you have said there was some procedural problem or something.   It – you do notknow whether it was discharged or fell away at some stage or whether it is still in existence?     H’m.   Yes.    Ja.    Well in any event it seems to me that certainly within SAPS or the Hawks somebody should look into that issue thoroughlyand see who – what the – why there seems to be nothing that has happened in regard to the other ma tters.  But also to look at the – at the one relating to the interdict because obviously I have no knowledge of the interdict that you talk about but courts would not lightly say somebody must not be disciplined at all when there seems to beevidence you know. They might say follow up with the right procedure if you want to discipline you know.  So somebody might need to look – look at that carefully.  Who would be the right person?  Would it be the head of the Hawks?  To ultimately who would have the ultimate responsibility to check these things and see if somebody is not doing their job.    Yes.    But they would all fall under the head of the national head of the Hawks or not?     Oh he is with…    Oh he is with…    SAPS – with SAPS ja.  But ultimately the n ational commissioner of SAPS would be able to talk to whoever at provinciallevel that needs to investigate and see what is happening.     If it is brought to his attention.     Yes.    Yes.   Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.  I think the legal team should while we are busy with the investigation maybe through the acting secretary ju st bring the matter to the attention of the national commissioner of SAPS to say that Major General Booysen raised this concern about a matter that he is giving evidence about for the national commissioner to lookinto it and – and see whether there is not something that is happened that should not be happening.  And I sure he would let the commission know what was found out.  Thank you Major General Booysen.     For raising the issue.  Thank you.    I must just check Ms September you have a soft voice let me check if they can hear you at the back?  Are you able to hear Ms September at the back?  They say I think they wish you to raise yourvoice a bit.    Ja.    Thank you.    Paragraphs 75 and 76 hey?     I think you said page?     Thank you.    75 and 76.   Ja.    I think it is called Inquiry.    I do not think it is a commission.    It is an inquiry in terms of the National Prosecuting Authority Act.    A commission will be a commission under theCommissions Act of 1947.    Okay. Ja.    Yes thank you.   Well you place it before me as nothing more thansimply a report of the Mokgoro Inquiry is it not?     You place it for no other purpose other than that it is a report of that inquiry?  What we make of it is another matter.     Ja.      But that is my understanding.    So I am just pointing that out because you said youput – place it before me as evidence.  So I think that might cause confusion.  I think you place it before me for what it is a report of the Mokgoro Inquiry.    Ja.  If you place it for any purpose you can comeback and tell me what that other purpose is.     Okay.    So to the extent that it might summarise or it might purport to summarise the evidence that you gave  at that inquiry as far as you are concerned it correctly does so.  It correctly summarises your evidence?    Thank you.  Okay.    Ja.    Well I have not – I have not read the report.  I pagedthrough.  From where to where does the report deal with the issue that Major General Booysen refers to?     Ja.    Ja well if you first tell me where I find it?     Is this not a summary of the judgment as Justice Mokgoro and her [indistinct] understood the judgment?     Because that does not need Major General Booysen’s confirmation as correct?     Ja.    I want to be able – I want you to identify the part of the report which Major General Booysen has talked about as a correctsummary of the evidence he gave at that inquiry.  That is w hat I want you to identify?    Yes.    I see at page 106 where it says Booysen’s version is    You talk about?    As Booysen’s evidence?     Is that what you are talking about?     So which part?  Is it this part that you and he are talking about when you say is a correct summary of his evidence before    Yes.    96 to page 143?    Is that the same that you have in mind when you asked him that question?  Is that the same?     Not particularly but that is what he is talking about that we know now?  Which one are you talking about when you were talking him the question?     Oh.    It looks like the –     I might have to take or are we back?  Ja  it looks like we are back.  Okay just continue or – there is goes again.  Okay it looks like we are back.  Okay pages 96 to – just repeat Major General Booysen?    Yes.    Of the report.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    Which you go along with?    Yes we – they fall outside of the pages you have just    Do you want to mention where they are if you do know?  But if you do not know she will help us later on.  I thought you might have it at hand.    Oh.    Ja okay later on that can be done.    Okay.    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER   Ja.    Hm.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER   Is accurate?    Reflected?    Okay.  Major General that is what you say that to the extent that the report refers to evidence that you gave in the Mokgoro Inquiry.  It reflects your evidence correctly?     Okay.  Thank you.  Then later on you can identifymaybe prepare a piece of paper that identifies where one can find all of those parts.    Thank you.    Well did you not want him to confirm that?     Yes.    Okay, thank you.   Well since we are dealing with two exhibits at  the same time just repeat that you are now – you are referring to EXHIBIT ZG.    So that there is no confusion as to which one of the two exhibits we are dealing with now.     Hm.    I am sorry.  I am confused.  You are referring to page 98 of EXHIBIT ZG?    Is that what you are referring to?     Or have I missed something?     Okay.    Okay.    Is that the paragraph of the report 5.2.1.4?     Ja, okay.  Yes.    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm.    Ja.    Guide the investigators?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   It was an unusually short period that was taken?     Yes.    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    Hm.  Have you since the time that instruction was issued have you ever been told or given an explanation why in your case this took such a short time ei ther through your own inquiries or through your lawyer’s inquiring or through any affidavits that may havebeen filed at some stage in court?     You have never – you have never been given any explanation?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    You say you did pertinently ask the question?     Oh, you did not, ja but you say you are not sure you may or may not have raised the issue in – in some affidavit?    Raised it?    Ja.    Many affidavits?    Yes.    Well it would be – it may be important to establish whether in any of the court applications that you made you raise the issue as part of challenging whatever you were challenging and to seewhether it was dealt with in response and if so by whom and how.  So that might be important to establish.  So maybe if you still have access to all your affidavits it might help to just check.     Yes.    Yes, thank you.    Yes.   Okay, hm.    Hm.   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm, but just to go back to your evidence earlier in regard to those photographs, When Colonel  Madhoe showed them to you is my understanding correct that you never asked him why are you showing me these photographs?     Ja (intervenes).    Yes.    So he did not – he did not answer what was the point of him showing you these photographs?   Hm.    Yes, but what I am saying is from what you are saying it seems to me that he did not give you an answer to your question. My understanding is that your question was – I am paraphrasing.  What is the point of showing these photographs?  Is my understanding correct?     But that was in effect the question you put to him?     And he did not give you an answer to that question?     Yes, okay.  Thank you.    When – I am sorry.  You went to court a number of times I think you said.  Is that right?  In regard to your suspensions and criminal charges against you.  Is that right?     Yes.  That must have been quite expensive in terms of lawyers?    Yes, okay.  Thank you.    And this was what year now – February what year?    Yes, okay and at that – at that stage who – the noticewould have come from whom – a provincially person?    Would it have been the National Commissioner of Police?    Oh, okay alright.  Thank you.    After – after – well I think if somebody is consideringsuspending anybody they are the ones who must give the basis first.  Why are they thinking of that in the first p lace?    So that – then you can address those issues rather than simply saying you must say why you should not be suspended without saying why they are thinking of suspending you in the first place.    That should apply to everybody.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Without answers to those questions? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Just before you proceed just to make sure one gets –understands who the players or the actors were in this context now.  You said the notice to – the notice giving – asking you to make representations why you should not be suspended came from General Dramat?    Hm.    Oh, okay.    I am sure you will explain how that came about.     Ja.    In due course.  That is fine, ja.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes, yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    I mean that did not make sense.  I mean you went to court because they – they suspended you.  If they wanted your application not to proceed they should – they would just have to withdraw the suspension.  Not the other way round.   Hm, yes.    Hm.    And the – so there were contempt proceedings that you had brought in the meantime as well?     Simultaneously with your application to?     And – and that – the basis of the contempt proceedings was that the suspension was in breach of the first court order which had said before they could suspend you they had to answer those – certain questions and you were s aying they were in breach of that court order because they suspended you without complying with that requirement?    Thank you.    Maybe before we proceed, what happened to the contempt proceedings because at some stage some finality would have  been required?    Yes yes, but from your own understanding would that mean that it may still be pending, or was it withdrawn formally or doyou have any recollection?     Ja, so you don’t know whether it was formally withdrawn but you effectively abandoned it.    Yes, okay thank you.   Did you say 600 instead of 60 days? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   That will be – 600 days will be more or less two years.    And was there ever an explanation why this was being done so late in breach of the 60 day requirement?     But that is from when, when did that happen?     Yes okay, thank you.    If that happened, if that happened, if you had gone for that route ,that option , what it would have meant is that one, the country would have paid you for three years for staying at home when you could have been working, that’s one, is that correct?     So but that’s one of the options she offered you.     Yes, okay.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   To sign for what now?    Oh ja.    What for?    Did General Dramat tell you whether he asked herwhat for?    Now the general that you referred, Nkombeni, the Provincial Commissioner.    And this was after the incidents, obviously it was after the incidents where she  called you and said stop the investigation and so on and so on.    Okay, yes alright.    Just again who was at this meeting?    Yes the Provincial Commissioner was not there?     She was also there.  This meeting was convenedpursuant to your suggestion there should be a round table meeting.     Okay, alright.  Maybe we will take the tea break now, and then we will resume.  Let’s take the tea break, it’s twenty past, we will resume at twenty five to.    We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS     I think Major General Booysen was in the middle of his evidence when he had to adjourn.  I think he may proceed from there.    We – we were dealing with – if I recall correctly but Imay be mistaken what happened after that round table meeting that you talked about and you returned to work after that, is that right?     And as I understand it you returned with  the intention to apply for leave or fill in leave forms which would have to beconsidered by General Dramat?     Okay thank you.    So it was a long time     Yes.    Just one second.    Maybe for the record you can help with the spelling for Letsholo or you are not – are you not able to?    If you are not able to that is fine maybe some othertime somebody will give it to us.    But anyway you - you say there was an investigation, forensic investigation by Price Waterhouse?     Yes.  And that investigation would have bee n authorised during the time you were not there?     Suspended.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    Yes.  So – but there was a decision not to prosecute notwithstanding that that is what you are saying?     Yes.  When you returned to work how long before that    How old was it?    Oh okay, alright.ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    H’m.    What are they?    Okay.    Okay.    Thank you.  Okay thank you.ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    We should – we can – maybe we should have them dealt with.  We should have them put separately b ecause the ones that you already have here they are referred to in his affidavit.  These onesare not referred to is it not?     So I think we will need to – we have got Exhibit ZA and ZB, is that right?    And then…    And then you have got ZG as well.  Have you got the other alphabets in between?     Oh okay then we should make Advocate Noko’s – is it Advocate Noko’s submissions?     That memorandum we should make it Exhibit Z[H].  H will be in brackets because you have put the others in brackets.  And then Major General Booysen’s – I think it is in the form of a letter.     Those are the witness – of the witness have theybeen marked or not?  I am sure he will be able to mark them.  He has dealt with these – with Exhibits for many years.  You understood which one I said would be Exhibit Z[H] that is Advocate Noko’s submissions.  Exhibit Z and in brackets [H] and your letter include – which contained your response Exhibit Z[I] and I will be in brackets.  Thank you.     Okay.    But let – before we go there I just want clarification.  So this briefing that you asked for from the people under you did it happen before you went on leave  or before you went on leave?     Oh okay so it was after?     Okay ja I wanted us to clear that part as to where it fell okay.  So your leave was – you went back to work, you filled in theforms for leave and General Dramat approved the leave?     Yes.    Yes.  During the time that you had been suspended for two years was there somebody acting in your position and if so who was it?    Yes.    Yes.    It did not happen ja.  Okay.  And I assume you had no – you had no hand in – no role in his appointment as – to act in yourposition?    Yes.  But generally you would be the person empowered to appoint a person to act in your position if you were  awayor would that be somebody else’s power?     Yes, yes.    Yes. Yes.  Okay thank you.    Yes.ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    Maybe let us start with this.  Do you want to in relation to Exhibit Z[H] that is the memorandum by Advocate Noko, do you want to highlight any particular fissures of her submissions that you think are important that may have struck you, that may – you may have decided should be dealt with in one way or another?     H’m.    H’m.    Well Ms September it is important to deal with the gist of the submissions by Advocate Noko and at least the gist of the – of Major General Booysen’s response.  Somebody listening needs to know what it was about, what was its purpose and to the extent that she was – she may have been saying the withdrawal of the charges was justified or the charges s hould be withdrawn for this and that reason.  At least the important fissures must be dealt with so somebody    And then the response what Major General Booysen may have said about some of those reasons.    Even if it is not everything.    Yes.    Ja but not…    Or maybe he has not had both you and him he have not had time to look at the important  ones.    Are quite important.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Let us deal with them.  Let us deal with everything because it is – it may be quite an important issue so let us hear – let us deal with the submissions from Advocate Noko and then we will deal  with – let us deal with them fully, it is okay.     Yes.  She indicates what this document – what thepurpose of the document is.  She says   H’m.  But – but the memorandum I have not read the memorandum so I think in case you have read it.  In the memorandumdoes she confirm the decision to withdraw the charges?     Is that right?    So the reason the substantiation that she is talking about therefore means she is giving reasons to justify her decision to withdraw the charges?    Against Panday andMAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    And Madhoe.  Yes okay I think that is where you – then everyone understands while looking at the reasons what reasons did she give for the decision to withdraw.  Okay deal with that.     No Ms September – no Ms September.  Let us hear what the reasons are that she gives first then we can go to GeneralBooysen’s critique of that if necessary.     Ja well let us do that.  This might be very important.     Okay because maybe you have not had enough time to look at them.    Okay.  So let us return to that part after lunch.  I thinkto the extent necessary we – you may just be able to say there were – there was that submission by Advocate Noko and Major General Booysen having read it was unhappy with the reasons given and he gave his comments in this submission that we will deal with later and    Ja.    Ja.    Ja.    To that question.    Yes.    Yes.  So it – if you deal with it without dealing with    It takes away the context?     It takes away the context.      Yes but let me just say what I am looking for.  I want to be told these were the reasons given by Advocate Nok o for the decision to withdraw a, b, c, d. okay?  Then because you responded to that you then say in regard to a, I did not have a problem, b I did not have a problem but I had a problem with c, d and e.  And my problem with c, d and e were the following b ang, bang, bang.  That is the kind of thing I am looking for.  I have not read this because they only gothanded up now so I am not able to assist – to assist.  If you are able to do it that way do it that way.  If you are unable we may have to read them you know throughout the – all the pages.    Yes.    Of continuing you need to say something.     Yes.    Yes okay yes.  Also your exhibit the Exhibit Z[I] was –    Yes he was the new NDPP at the time.     Okay yes.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.  And the purpose of your letter which contained your views on the Noko submission the purpose was to get that decision reversed, is that right?     That was your – yes okay continue.    Oh okay let us get the sequence correctly.  You returned to work after the two weeks leave.  You get briefed on matters that were ongoing when you were suspended and in regard to the Panday, Madhoe matter you get – you get furnished with Advocate Noko’s submissions as to why it was justified to withdraw the charges.  You prepare comment on that the purpose of which was to have that decision reversed so that the prosecution could proceed against Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe.  And at that time General D ramat was still    That letter.    Yes but after that – after some time she was – he was    Yes.    And just mention the years as well because there are too many years we are dealing with here.     Yes.    H’m.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    H’m.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is Ntlemeza?MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    That is what he said yes.    Yes.    You do not know ja, yes.  Okay, but you say about a month after that interview.    About a month of two he was appointed?     Yes.    But all the other people that as far as you knew had applied and you do not know whether he had applied or not were there?     Yes, okay.  Thank you.  Okay.Let us also just get clarification.  General Dramat got suspended and General  Ntlemeza was appointed to act in his position.  How long did he – for how long did he act before he    Yes.    2015.    Yes.  Oh, okay.  So I just wanted to get a ti meframe, yes.  Okay.  You say within a week or so after he was permanentlyappointed you got a notice from him asking you for representations why you should not be suspended?     Once – yes and – and what was your response?     Yes.    Yes.    I am sorry.  Let us - was fraud the only thing that was the basis of the notice?     Okay, alright.    What – what did he say the fraud was about?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm.    What kind of award would that be?  What was it for?  Is it a performance?    Ja.    Oh, okay – okay.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   So it was a monetary award connected with excellent performance of their duties?     He must still tell us what he was still telling us about    So the members of SAPS were said to have cl aimed – put in claims for a monetary award?     Ja.    It is an application.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    But are you saying that – was the position that General Ntlemeza said in effect you should be charged for or he saidthat you should make representations why you should not be suspended on the basis that you may have committed fraud and the fraud that he was talking about was based on the fact that a certain date had been given in the document that you had signed.  Is that right?     Oh, you never signed it?  Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes but what was according to General  Ntlemeza’s letter what associated you with that date that you say was wrong?     Did he accuse you of having given?     The wrong information or something?     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.  Hm.  Anyway you made representations to Mr Ntlemeza saying among other things this is - it is clear when you read the document that this is a typographical error and you say despite that he still suspended you?     Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Yes.  Okay, thank you.  The – General Ntlemeza’s notice and Major-General Booysen’s response are they here because then if they    They are not here?    For the sake of completeness it might be important to    Ja.  If you can make them available that would be helpful because it is important.    To see what facts you place before him and despite that he made the decision continue with the dec ision.    Ja.  Thank you.    Are you able to remember this suspension – this application that you had just won in court now – that you have justtalked about where Judge  Van Zyl gave judgment.  That was what – the second or the third time that you had to challenge a suspension in court?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Then there was a disciplinary inquiry?     Which found in your favour?     Yes and then you were told about various options by    And then you went on leave.  Then you came back and then and there was this suspension now by General  Ntlemeza?    So it was a second suspension.  Is that right or athird?    The third one ja.    Yes.  Okay, alright.  So continue.     Hm.    So you had just said that something had happened and General Ntlemeza was preparing to suspend you again or I think or I think – I thought it was something you were saying that or did I misunderstand you?    Yes.  I know about the first suspension. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   You won.  He applied for leave.  He was turned down.  He petitioned the SCA.  Was he turned down there as well?     Ja.    Hm.    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    2017?MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Huh-uh.    Till July?    Yes and did that form a settlement o f the appeal or not?    Proceed with the appeal?     Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm.    In terms of procedural issues? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm, okay.  Yes, continue.    What page in the Mokgoro Report do you want to refer us to?    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Would the letter that he was expected to sign have been a letter to authorise your prosecution?     It would have been a recommendation?     That you be prosecuted?    Okay.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   How – how soon after that – if you are able to say?     Yes, okay.    Hm.    So just to understand.  So as you unders tand the position Advocate Mlotshwa in regard to the Amigos case which related to Mr Mabuyakhulu among others and Ms  Nkonyeni – in regard to that case your understanding is that pressure was being put on him towithdraw the charges and he was refusing and in regard to you he was being asked to recommend your prosecution and he was saying until I have supporting documents that show how these individuals are linked to the enterprise I am not prepared to sign.  That was his stance in    Thank you.  So after Advocate Mlotshwa – afterAdvocate Mlotshwa was no longer the Acting DPP and Advocate  Noko had been appointed Acting DPP then your indictment was signed?     Or your prosecution was?     Authorised?    Ja.    Was recommended?    Ja, okay by her that is Advocate  Noko to.    Yes.    (Intervenes).    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Let us go there if we can.  Ms  September do you know where that is or not really?     Well it is Major-General Booysen that is looking for something.  I think he said it is in the judgment.  Is that right?Major-General Booysen.    What you are looking for is in the judgment?     Yes.    And which is it - Judge Van Zyl’s judgment or    Oh.  Oh, oh here, okay.    Ja.    Ja.    Okay.  Look for it during the lunch break, okay. ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER   Yes.    I am sorry.  Let us finalise Advocate Noko gets appointed as Acting DPP what happens?  Let us – let us get that story.  What happens after that?     Ms Nkonyeni.    Hm, yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.  So your prosecution is recommended by her to the National – the Acting – to the NDPP?     At that time who was the NDPP – Mr Nxasana or…?     Oh, Miss Jiba, and was your prosecution then    Yes and you were served with an indictment?     Yes okay continue.  ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER    Thank you.        To Exhibit Z?  ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER    ZA okay.     Basically they say this is the charge, these are the requirements for us to prove this charge, this is the evidence that wehave that proves each of the elements, that’s what they go through more or less.     Yes.     Yes, yes.       I’m sorry what page?     Of ZA?     Sorry just hang on one second.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER    But the report that I was looking at was at ZE.  Was I on the wrong document, the report that you were asking the witness     ZA not ZE?     Okay what was the page, let’s go back to it because I think I was looking at the wrong one then.      204, okay so that’s the prosecution memorandum that (indistinct) says was used in regard to his racketeering case, is     Okay.   The one at 261?       Yes that’s the one you want to identify or at least to find, okay.   Okay will you check over the lunch break.      Are you able to make the point without looking at it that you may have wanted to make about it or you’d rather make it after lunch when it has been filed?      Yes, okay thank you.       I’m sorry, I’m sorry, let’s know about the documents first.  This one at 261 you say is a presentation where?      Yes.   Which we have seen.       Yes.     Yes.     Yes okay.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER    I’ve got it.     Yes the one affidavit is one at page 191 the  other one is where?     199 okay so there are original affidavits – there areoriginal versions of the same affidavits that are signed?      Maybe for what it’s worth just in case we never get to the signed ones, do you confirm that the contents of both affidavits are true and correct?     So you say, he say s something that’s quite criticalfor the charge but there is no – nothing in the docket that supported that statement, that’s what you’re saying?      Yes he says that is his interpretation of what was in the docket and what was in the docket was certain two people which didnot involve you, spoke about – said something to the effect that they needed to talk to you.     Yes and they would talk to you about it.      Yes okay.     And he could only speak on the basis of what was in the docket, he couldn’t speak on the basis of anything else?     Yes but what I’m asking is whether he – for purposed of him performing the function that he was performing, he was supposed to base whatever he was saying on what was in the docket isthat right?     But you are saying he was not doing that he was going outside the docket and basing some of the things on what was     Yes.     But if you – if somebody else had told him about it, as long as that was not part of the docket he was not supposed to rely on it, isn’t it?     He would have needed to get a statement from that person, that statement – that person’s statement would be part of the docket.     And he included it?MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.     So – but both prosecutions were still about the samething?     Ja, okay thank you.     That’s the statement before us?      Yes.     Yes.     And did he ever provide any basis for saying that, that witness was killed at any stage, as far as you know?      So – but you say it would be easy for somebody tothink that was – that’s what he intended saying but you say he doesn’t say so expressly?     Yes but you say as a matter of fact that witness diedof natural causes and this was brought to his attention?      Thank you.     I looks like we have reached the point for the lunch break.     Yes, we’ll take the lunch break and resume at two, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay you may proceed Ms September.     Okay.    Yes.    Ja well let us hear what are those?  What were the reasons given and then let us deal with each one.     Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Every point.  Yes.    Yes.  Where is the first reason that she gives in the points let us deal with that and then you can refer to your …     2.3 ja.   Okay what was that reason?     And case 781 is the Panday case?    Okay.      If that is …     You can read it ja.    If that is the best way.    Yes.    Yes.    And that is in what paragraph in your … MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes okay yes.    Before the appointment?   Oh before the 2010 Soccer World Cup is that right?     Yes.    Yes.    And your response is there is ample evidence and you say there are more than whatever the number is of lever arch files ofevidence and in this paragraph she has not said anything about having looked at that evidence, is that right?     Yes okay. Continue.    Yes okay your response.    Of course generally speaking there would be no problem with a prosecutor or DPP when looking at a particular case and they look at the investigating officer’s statement and so on and they look at the statement by the accused or suspect if he or she has made one.  If they were to come to a decision in good faith that they believe the suspect’s version rather than the investigating officers – that generally speaking should be no problem.  You have no quarrel withthat generally speaking?     Yes.      It is only because of the specific circumstances of this one that you have a problem with that?     Yes.    Yes, ja, ja no that is – yes let us continue.    Yes.    Yes okay thank you.  Yes let us continue.     Yes.    What is she saying there?  I am not sure that I follow.  About non-existent?    Ja I cannot understand.  Yes how did you respond?     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.    Provise that and then quote on the direct instructions. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    H’m.  Yes.    Her – Advocate Noko’s paragraph 2.10. “The allegation that the accused in 466 Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe wanted Major General Booysen to pre-date a report in the 781 case in order to ha vethe Section 205 subpoena set aside [subpoenas for access to the bank account records] and consequently bribe Major General Booysen to do that does not really hold water because the fact that if there has been any corruption [bribing of MajorGeneral Booysen] that took place would not make the corruption and its successful prosecution impossible.  As Sections 3B and 4[1}B of the Prevention and Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act 12 2004 state the alleged report in the 781 case that it was alleged was to be a predated to invalidate the Section 205 subpoena did not suffice to proof fraud or any offence against anyone especially Madhoe and Panday who are alleged to have bribed Booysen for the predating of his very – of this very report.  Thisreport is made out to be the evidence in the 781 case to prove fraud against Panday and Madhoe but one wonders why it would not be seen in this way by the SCCU.  If then there is no fraud that could be proven by the SCCU in the 781 case why would Colonel Madhoe and Mr Panday bribe Booysen or anyone for that matter in respect of 781 case using this report?  One would expect that they would know what is contained in 781 case against them as they are part of it.  They would know what they did not even know– they would know what they did …”    What they did …    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    Yes. No stop there sorry.    Hm.  So in her conclusion in her memorandum Advocate Noko among other things says that she has decided to decline to prosecute Colonel  Madhoe and Mr Panday for corruption or    You touched your head ja.    Okay.    Yes.    Ja.    There was the video recording as well.     Yes and – and do you know personally that all of this evidence or statements by these police officers and your own statements all of that were in the docket?  You know that that was thecase at least before you were suspended or so on.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Ja.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and then part of what you are saying it is difficult to understand how she could say that in the light of that evidence thatwas there?    That is part of what you are saying?     Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and to the extent that she says among other people you – to the extent that she may be saying you may have had anagenda.    To have the Provincial Commissioner falsely implicated and prosecuted?  Ha d she sought your own statement about that allegation?  Had you been approached by her or anybody to say there is this allegation that you are part of an agenda to do this and did you get a chance to refute that before you saw this memo?     Hm.    Ja.    Hm.    So these assertions that she makes in her memorandum that - at least we can talk about you - that you may have been pursuing a certain agenda about the Provincial Commissioner and that you may have been pressurising Panday and Madhoe to falselyimplicate the Provincial Commissioner.  When she wrote this memo she had never herself or through anybody put this to you to hear your version?    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Falsely implicate the Provincial Commissioner?     Okay, thank you.  It is just that it is – it seems to be concerning.  I mean she was acting in a senior position of Deputy – DPP in KZN.  Would that not be the highest provincial position under    Yes.    In the whole Province yes.    And here you were a very senior member of the – of the police service – a member of the Hawks.  If there was such an allegation that you were involved in something so wrong to have asenior – the Provincial Commissioner of Police falsely implicated one would have expected that before she made the decision such as withdrawing charges she would have at least heard what you had to say about this allegation that you were part of an agenda.     Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.  Do you know whether she ever saw your – your comment that you said to Mr Nxasana or you do not know?    Yes.  What are these?    Ja.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER   Okay.  We will need to mark this as EXHIBIT Z(J).     The last one was I.    This will be EXHIBIT Z(J).  That is now the letter thatis blue coming from Advocate  M Noko-Mashilo acting Director of Public Prosecutions KwaZulu-Natal and addressed to Advocate  N Jiba Acting National Director of Public Prosecution dated 15 August 2012.    I take it that Advocate M Noko-Mashilo is the sameperson who so far we have been referring to as Advocate Noko?     Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    This document will be EXHIBIT Z(K) and it is purports to be an application for authorisation in terms of Se ction 2(4) of POCA 121 of 1998.  It is from Advocate  M Noko Director of Public Prosecutions KZN and it is addressed to Advocate  S K Abrahams NDPP,yes.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Okay, thank you.    The events that you refer to that were happening roundabout this time.  Do you want to deal with them or not – they arenot necessarily in your evidence?     Ja, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes.  I do not know whether wh at I am going to ask will relate to the next document that we have just referred to - which Ms September will deal with - namely the question of whether when Ms Noko – if you do know – when Ms Noko recommended your prosecution the documents that Mr  Mlotshwa – Advocate Mlotshwa had said he would not sign it if they were not before him whether they were before Ms Noko?  You might or might not know (intervenes).     Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, but we do not know which documents?     She perused.  They might or might not include the ones that Advocate Mlotshwa thought were important to be furnished we do not know.  Is that right or we do?     Yes.    Yes.  Okay.  I think it will be important to establish well one, what the documents were that Advocate  Mlotshwa were insisting should be there because if he signed or recommended prosecution without them it would be improper and then of course it would be necessary to apply one’s mind to the question whether he was correct on insisting on those documents and three whether in makingthe recommendation Ms  Noko had those documents.  Obviously if Advocate Mlotshwa was wrong to insist on those documents then even if Advocate Noko recommended without those documents that might not be anything negative towards her, but if those documents were important to be before the person taking the decision to recommendand she recommended without those documents then one would need to look at that.  Thank you.   I’m sorry, where are you?     The one with the statement?     Yes, what page?     Okay, yes.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER    Page two of?     Oh okay of the statement? ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER    Is that J?     K okay, alright what page on that one or paragraph?      Ja.   I saw those notes in your bundle earlier on do you know where they are?       Was it not Annexure 23 or something?     Have you found Annexure 12?    The handwritten one first then we can look at the typed version.       Let me just get there I remember that I got the difficult to read – yes thank you, then you say there is a typed version.      Yes okay, did you find it easy to read this, I’m thinking how reliable your typed version is, have you got a typed version from the author that would obviously be much more accurate but you might – if you are able to read quite well the notes, that’s fine.      Yes.     Okay thank you. I think that – so that one can’t put this when maybe one could put this – one can’t put this in here because it’s not part of this affidavit.     So I think we must make it an Exhibit on its own thelast one was K so this will be L, that will be Exhibit ZL and it’s the typed version of the handwritten notes at page 145 of Exhibit ZA as understood by Major General Booysen.      Thank you yes.     Yes.     It’s not bold in the handwritten notes.      And the KZN DPP at that time, would it have been advocate Malogwa?     The shooting was justifiable and the other hand hesays he was concerned about...(intervention).      One would have expected that if the Minister  of Police had any concern that the National Prosecuting Authority was notacting diligently in regard to the prosecution of any particular people that maybe the police had put together enough evidence for, one would have expected that he would raise that with the Minister of Justice and that it would be the Minister of Justice if he thought that it was proper to raise any concern that would raise the concern with the NPA.     So here – and the notes, if they correctly reflect the people who were there or if they correctly reflect – ja if they correctly reflect the people who are there, there’s no indication that the Minister    Yes do you recall who the Minister of Justice was at that time?      Maybe Minister Gadebe.   Okay thank you.       Excuse me, what page is it?      Yes.     So you’re linking it with what you said earlier on, namely what was the Minister of Police doing having a meeting withprosecutors, one.  Two, what is somebody from the Minister ’s office having to – what does he have to do with these matter, that’s what you are raising.     Sorry you did tell us – you say this letter, the copy we have at page 147 doesn’t show the author but you did say it was the DPP for Southern Gauteng?      Oh but this one was signed by who?      Chauke ja okay thank you.     Yes.    Yes.    Oh.    H’m.    Oh the KZN acting DPP at the time?     Yes.    Well when I read this I wrote on the side which Minister is this?    H’m.    Well the meeting to which you referred to earlier and in respect of which you have produced a typed version of certain notes, handwritten notes indicate that that meeting in which the Minister is said to have attended with among other public prose cutors or ND – NPA people was on the 8 March 2012?     And this letter or email is dated 12 June 2012?     I am sorry I think that last paragraph may be important. Mr Chauke says to – or Advocate Chauke says to Advoc ate    Yes.  Okay thank you.ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    Are you back on the Mokgoro Report?     Okay.  And what page?     Okay I have got it.  127 hey?     Yes.    Yes.    Do you know whether – whether Mosing is the one who made the handwritten notes is it not?     Do you know whether the issue of those notes and what they mean and who was present at that meeting is covered in    H’m.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Ja.    Yes.    H’m.    Ja that is fine ja.  Okay.  The important ones.     Ja that is fine.    Why would Mr Zuma’s legal representations when they were made be relevant for purposes of this witness’ evidence?     Ja but I did not understand anything that you said so far to – to be – to the effect that his prosecution may have been connected with the prosecution or non-prosecution of Mr Zuma.  My understanding was that his prosecution was concerned with the investigations that he or his team were involved in relating to Mr Panday, Colonel Madhoe and the Provincial Commissioner of SARS.     That does not seem to me to be connected in anyway.    H’m.    On reflection Ms September on reflection it does not appear to me that there is much purpose to be served in just reading    Ja okay.    Some of the dates might be important to emphasise in relation to specific evidence by the witness.  So if there is specific evidence by the witness in relation to a specific incident th en you go to those dates to indicate the context.     What page did you say?     Okay.    Is that a slide we have not seen before? ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER    We have not seen?    Okay.    Z[D]?    Okay.  Is the point to be made – is the slide quite important for the point to be made – to be shown?    Okay.  Thank you.  What page at Exhibit Z[D].     Okay.  Yes thank you.    H’m.    I am sorry.    Just repeat that I did not hear.  Just repeat that.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes. MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL    Yes.    H’m.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.

I saw that it does…     Have but I got the impression that I may be wrong itseemed to have or I thought it had only a few.  I thought he might be having more people in mind I am not sure.  Does he have all?     It has all?    Of what is in the statement.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes I think – I think the point that Major General Booysen you want to make I do not know if you are confident th at you have made it sufficiently clearly or maybe Ms September was still going to come to it to simply say in – or prosecutor – so and so on – so and so was involved in that case, and that case and that case this is what he did in that case.  In that other  case he was also involved and this iswhat happened in that case.  In that other case the other one was involved and that is what he did.  I thought maybe that might be what you wanted to say but you might or might or not feel that you want to.     Do you want to read your statement because you have..    Ja.  Okay just refer to it to refresh your memory.     Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    H’m.    H’m.    Yes, yes.  Ja you – the point – part of the point you are making is they were created for purposes of dealing with very serious matters which fall within a certain category.     You know genocide you mentioned and you mention others and you say but they were now involving themselves in matters that in terms of priority you would not expect them to be really involving themselves in.  That is the point you make?     Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.

Maybe before you proceed we are at either one minute to four or 4 o’ clock.

The Spy case – the Spy Tapes case – am I correct in thinking that initially what the Democratic Alliance - because I think they are the ones who brought an application to court.  What they sought was to be furnished with those tapes and what you are saying is that Advocate  Jiba been ActingNational Director of Public Prosecutions at the ti me would have been the one to make a decision whether to release those tapes or not but you say she refused.  Is that what you are saying?     You say she frustrated that process?     Yes, okay alright.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.  I am trying to remember but maybe you mightremember better.  The suspension of Advocate  Breytenbach related – did it relate to her handling of the Mdluli matter or was it on something else or is that the detail that you cannot remember?     Okay.    Hm.

Made clear but I was not sure about whether there was anything in the letter of suspension that indicated whether the suspension was linked to her handling of the Mdluli matter but you mayhave read something that suggested that that was the case.  I cannot remember but I am sure you will – you will check.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes, okay.    Huh-uh.    This is now at the Nelson Mandela Foundation?MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Offices?    Okay, alright and you said you got the invitation from who?    From a journalist?    Okay, yes.    Hm.

Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Yes I – it would be important to check whether it is the President who makes the appointment or the NDPP but I thought maybe you can check overnight.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    The recommendation for your prosecution?     Ja.    Yes.    So you say what she said is contradicted by objec tive facts?    Yes, thank you.    Let’s go back to the last point we were making aboutAdvocate Noko, so during her interview when she was a candidate for the position of NDPP recently she was asked about the matter relating to you by one of the panellists and she said when she became acting DPP the matter was already on the roll.     She found it on the court roll.     Ja, and that was the end of that line of questioning?     Yes, okay.    I think it would be important to get a copy of the transcript of her interview if we don’t already have it here so that we can have a look at whatever may be relevant that transpired during her interview, including the point that Major General Booysen is mentioning.    Yes of Advocate Noko, she is the only one, because Major General Booysen is saying she was asked about the matter relating to him and she said she found the matter already on the court roll and Major General Booysen says that’s false, there are objective facts which show that it was not on the court roll when she came, and she is the one who did the recommendation, so it would be good to find out exactly what the transcript reflects.     Yes.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER   Now the relevance of the promotion, of theirpromotion is it that the promotion was linked to the work they were doing in relation to the prosecution of people like you, or it’s just being  mentioned?    Yes, okay.  Now the people from within the NPA who gave you this information do you have any idea whether they would be prepared to come and give evidence about that to the extent that it may be deemed necessary or is that something you don’t know?     Okay.  And you will give the names to the Legal Team?    Oh, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    In this Commission?    The de facto ja.    Ja, yes.  Do we have that judgment that General Booysen is talking about in the bundle?     Okay, it should be secured, we should have that.  Is your recollection that in that matter Advocate Abrahams had also filed an affidavit?    And whether his affidavit was saying that it was    But you say three judges rejected that version?     And said it was him who made the decision?     Yes, yes.    Yes, and do you know whether that matter is somewhere in the Court system with appeals or not or is that something you don’t know at the moment?     So basically what I am looking for is whether those findings still stand or whether they’re subject to some appeal ...(intervention)     Yes.    Okay, we need to have that judgment and it may bethat depending on when one reads the judg ment, it may or may not be necessary to have a look at one or more of the affidavits that may be affected on that issue.    Ja, okay.    And then related to her role in your case? MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN   Yes because obviously it was relevant.     It’s still in Greek?    Yes, it hasn’t been translated?    Is he not conversant in Greek?     What page?    182?ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER   Well General Booysen I was saying asking whether he is not conversant in Greek because you know there are people in the country who are conversant in many languages so until one knows whether he is conversant in Greek ...     Yes, that was – is that in a matter that has been    Oh.    Yes, and do you remember when the time will expire by when he should file his affidavit, or is it still coming or is it gone,you don’t have to be exact, I’m just estimating.     Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Yes.    More material.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    H’m.    October, November 2018 or 17?     Yes.    Yes.    H’m.    H’m.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    H’m.    Ja, yes.    H’m.    H’m.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    Okay.  Okay.  Okay so one is not sure what will happen with – with the matter in the light of the new NDPP but sill pending?    Ja.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    NDPP.  Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    File a [indistinct].    Okay.    H’m.    Ja.  Okay.  Okay it is  five o’clock so we will adjourn.  I think Mr Paul Pretorius had requested that I consider that we start at half past nine tomorrow morning and I think I may have agreed.  But I want to change that back to normal time at ten o’clock.  If you can live with that Mr Pretorius?    That is the only reason otherwise I would not hesitate that we start earlier if it suited everybody including Major General Booysen.  So if it is fine let us start at ten.     Yes.  Is that fine with you?     Okay thank you.  We will adjourn the proceedings for the day then until tomorrow morning at ten.  We adjourn.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Good morning Chair.    Before we do I understand that we have colleagues who are seated here who may wish to place themselves on record.     Who may wish to place themselves on record.    Yes there is.    Thank you Chair.  Chair there is one last quick matter and that is that an additional bundle is before you.  It is marked Exhibit ZG.    Yes Chair.    I beg leave that it forms part of    Yes.    Thank you Chair.      We will need it for today Chair.  Based on the long adjournment…    The witness was givin g evidence in relation to the Cato Manor investigator which begins at Exhibit bundle ZA page 23.    Thank you Chair.  Before we commence where we left off…    Thank you Chair.  Before we – before we get to where we left off on the last occasion you will recall General Booysen that you gave evidence in relation to the ToshanPanday case which was guided by the timeline in Slide 2.  Is there anything in particular that you wish to add in addition to th e evidence that you had given in relation to that matter?     Can…    Chair if I may?  I humbly apologise for the interruption.    Thank you.    Thank you Chair.   Sorry if we could then resume where we left off and that is then on page 23 of Exhibit ZA.     I will speak a little louder.    In that case let us resume at page 23 of Exhibit ZA.    General Booysen following the evidence that you gave in relation to the Toshan Panday investigation you then addressed two additional investigations one which you have termed to be the Amigos  Investigation and the other which was thelooting of the secret service account.   You then turned to the Cato Manor investigation and when last this matter was heard you had sketched a factual background in relation to the investigation.  To this end can I ask you to turn to Exhibit ZG which is the new bundle that has been placed before the commission?  So from your main affidavit atpage 23 you deal with the Cato Manor investigation very briefly and that is but in two paragraphs which is at page 75 and 76.  Since our last hearing.    Correct Chair.    Oops.  Paragraph     Sorry paragraph 75 and 76.    On page 23.    Since the last hearing a report has been publicised which relates to the inquiry in terms of Section 12(6) of the National Prosecuting Authority Act and the unabridged version of that report is contained as Exhibit ZG.  This particular report relates to the commission which was chaired by Justice Mokgoro.     Inquiry.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you.    Apologies for my error.    This report – this report related to the inquiry which was chaired by Justice Mokgoro.  For ease of reference we will refer to the report as The Mokgoro Report.  Have you considered this report General Booysen?     And it is correct that you gave evidence at this inquiry?     Just to clarify the context of this particular report if I ask you to tu rn to page 14.  At paragraph 12 it    Thank you.  Chair while we place this entire report before you and tender it as evidence we will not deal with or detract from the particularity or detail in the report but simply highlight certain evidence relevant to this witness so this witness can then augment some evidence that was not necessarily placed before the inquiry.    Yes.    Yes Chair.     To the…    If I am…    As it pleases Chair.    Okay.    Then let me ask General Booysen in considering the parts of this report which relates to you do you have any comment on the accuracy of the evidence as it is recorded in here which you gave at the inquiry?     Okay.    And accordingly Chair to  thatextent we do not intend to lead all this evidence again.     But rather just augment certain aspects of it to the extent necessary.     Yes I will take – I will take us through the relevant excerpts.    With your leave.    No problem.  The first reference of the pertinent case relating to General Booysen is at page 58.  It is in fact a synopsis of the case of Booysen versus ActingNational Director of Public Prosecutions and others 2014 2ALL SA319KZD which was delivered on the 26 February 2014 by Justice Gorven.    Correct Chair.  That very judgment appears…     In fact…    No problem Chair.  If we go to page 97 of the same Exhibit.    That deals particularly with the Booysen case.  It relates to pages 97 to 143 which start s at paragraph 295 to 453.  In particular to General Booysen’s evidence.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Not particularly.    General Booysen is indeed correct to the extent that evidence relatin g to his matter is contained in– from page – hello.    I do not know what happened.    Hello.    Okay.    If I could perhaps just clarify.    Thank you Chair.  Following your return to work were any – were there any further disciplinary steps taken against you?    Hand these documents up please?    The one document relates to a submission by Advocate Noko in relation to the withdrawal of charges inthe corruption matter against Mr Toshan Panday and Colonel Navin Madhoe.    And the other is a memorandum – apologies.  The other is a response by General Booysen to that particular memorandum.     And these were documents that he called for upon his return to office.    No it is not Chair.    Yes Chair.    And it runs to ZG.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.  That is the one at the bottom.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Thank you Chair.      Thank you Chair.  If I could then quickly refer you to Exhibit Z[H] which is the mem orandum that was prepared by Advocate Noko in relation to the withdrawal ofcharges.    General Booysen it was your evidence that when you returned to office you called for a reporting onthe status of investigations?     If you could look at Exhibit Z[H] which is the memorandum prepared by Advocate Noko dated the 21  October 2014.  Is this a memorandum that was placed before you when calling for a status update?     And that letter under your hand    Okay.  Can you  please explain the basis of your letter and the objections that you had taken as documented in your letter?     Thank you.      No problem Chair.    No problem Chair.  The response that was prepared by General Booysen is quite specific to the paragraph referenced in Advocate Noko’s submissions.    And if with your leave CHAIRPERSON   Okay.  General Booysen…    As it pleases Chair.  If we could then look at the documents simultaneously.  Your first issue as taken in paragraph 3 of your letter relates to paragraph 2.3.      For the benefit of those listening paragraph 3 of your letter or rather let me start me off by saying paragraph 2 of your letter makes a general statement to say that it –  “This missive from Advocate Noko is rather verbose it is permeated with conjecture, innuendo,inaccuracies and in certain instances blatant untruths.  The assertions are an aberration which lacks substance supported by credible evidence.”     Would you like me to address all of the reasons and not just those that he objected to or took issue with?    Okay.  With your leave then Chair it is quite a technical document. Could I then read the paragraphs as indicated into the record?  General Booysen does raise issues with very specific paragraphs and not all of them but I am guided by your    No problem Chair.    At a later stage.    After lunch.    General Booysen you returned to work.  You go on leave.  Were there any subsequent disciplinary     Thank you Chair.  To quickly address some of the preliminary  matters that were raised before we    Which is currently in process.    And then in relation to Exhibit Z[H] and [I].    General Booysen has looked at these in particularity – in particular detail and in doing so it is understood that his letter of response takes issue by and large with majority of what is contained in Advocate Noko’s letter but I will leave itto his evidence to give the details to that.     Okay.    If I can then through General Booysen.  General Booysen if you can refer to Exhibit Z[H] okay.  As previously placed on record this is in fact a letter or a memorandum rather from Advocate Noko dated 21 Octob er 2014 in which it is documented that she had previously provisionally withdrawn thecorruptions charges against Mr Toshan Panday and Colonel Navin Madhoe and in doing so sets out the substantiation in relation to that decision below from paragraph 2 onwards.  Having considered this particular document can you please inform the Chair as to the detail of    Thank you.  And then it is the last part to the Mokgoro Report.      Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    And in particular deals with the    To highlight to you Chair at page 138 Jiba’s evidence on Booysen is recorded at paragraph 430 to 453.  And effectively this section in relation to the Booysen case as    The only other reference to the Booysen case or the pertinent sections then is at page 311 of the report.    And that reference is at page 128.    Paragraph 396 and 397.    Thank you.  As alluded toearlier at paragraph – sorry at page 311 of the report the ev idence related to the cases are then evaluated and the Booysen prosecution is specifically dealt with under paragraph 6.1.5.1 running from paragraph 68 until 1078 on page 313.      Reference is also alluded to Booysen in page 327 and although it relates to other evidence as such under 7.1 – paragraph – sorry paragraph ja 7. Or clause 7.1 Jiba    Those are the pertinentsections of this report which deals with Booysen.  I do wish to however direct your attention to page 345.      For the record in these proceedings there are certainly dates and events which are informed by this witness’ evidence that I believe needs to be read into the record    Just read certain dates and events into the record which is…     Important to – or not just important but it is actually informed by the evidence of this witness.     Okay.  If I could then s tart on page 345. “23 December 1998 Jiba’s application to be admittedas an attorney struck from the role.  6 August 2000 Jiba appointed as DDPP.”  Page 346. “29 November 2007 Decision to prosecute Zuma is taken by Mpshe and McCarthy.12 December 2007 Jiba suspended from NPA.  28 December 2007 Indictment is served on Zuma.  June 2008 Zuma launches application to review and set aside the decision to prosecute him.”  Next page 347. “12 September 2008 Nicholson J being Justice Nicholson hands down judgment in favour or Zuma. 12 January 2009 SCA overturns Judge Nicholson’s decision to review the decision prosecute Zuma.   February 2009 Zuma’s legal representativesprovide representations to NPA.  3 March 2009 Prosecution team considered Zuma’s representations.” Next page 348. “1 April 2009 Mpshe…”     Chair this particular witnessmakes a submission and that submission relates to the prosecutorial system.  I am happy to deal with that…     As it pleases Chair.     “11 June 2009 which is on page 348 Jiba refers suspension to Labour Court invoking the Protected Disclosures Act.” Next page 349. “4 September 2009 and 8 September 2009. Mrwebiand Jiba sign settlement agreements with NPA.  9 September 2009 Jiba…”     Sorry.  If I can then take you back to your statements.    As it pleases Chair.  We arenow on page 25 of your statement in particular paragraph 83.   As it pleases Chair.  We are now on page 25 of your statement in particular paragraph 83.      Page 25.    And it is Exhibit Z[A].  If I can ask for the following slide to be shown and that is slide 3.  Sorry slide 4.  Excuse me.    No we have not seen it as yet.    If we could – Chair you couldfind a copy of that slide in Exhibit Z[D].     Yes.    Yes Chair.    It is Z[D] page 4.    So if we could look at Z[D]page 4 while they – the witness then addresses his evidence from page 83 in his statement.    Okay.  The next theme of your evidence General Booysen is that you address prosecutors and individual prosecutors within the system.     Or those who had …    The next theme.CHAIRPERSON   Of General Booysen’s evide nce is that he now addresses prosecutors, individual prosecutors within the system in the context of the investigations, the four investigations that    Yes Chair.    General Booysen the slide before you is a combination of four interlinking circles and one circle is marked periphery.    Can you please explain what    In fact Chair if I may.    The diagram before you.    Presents…    Yes Chair.    In fact it is a representation of …    All of the prosecutors that he is about to deal with individually.    And …    And the scheme of thisparticular diagram is that Panday Investigation is the blue circle, Amigos case is the red circle, Looting of Secret Service account is the yellow circle, Cato Manor is the green circle.  Where these circles then interlace those would represent public prosecutors.     Can – there is already been evidence placed before this commission in relation to that through another witness but can I ask you to just clarify and explain what you mean by highlighting this particular unit?     If I can then take you to page 27 of your affidavit and to paragraph 89 in particular.      89 Chair.    Page 27 of Exhibit Z[A] which  is the affidavit.    So we will work through the affidavit now.    Page 27.    Paragraph 89.    I do not – sorry I do note the time but there is just one particular point with your leave?     Because notwithstanding the fact that it is General Booysen’s stateme nt that he has – that there has been a reauthorisation.    For the charges under the helm of Advocate Shaun Abrahams.  It is important to place on record that atpage 182 of this bundle at paragraph 9 it is Gor ven J’s finding or 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Morning Chair.    Morning Chair.    I think I do Chair.    Indeed there is Chair.  One thing that – that concerns me and it has been of a great concern to me over the last couple of years.  As we speak or the Colonel fro m the South African Police Service Colonel Navin Madhoe who had put just under R1.4 million in the boot of my car in an attempt to bribe me – he is still at work.  After that event I was arrested and suspended.  I will deal with that but the problem that I  have is that Colonel Navin Madhoeis still sitting in the same position dealing with the same matters and it had been brought to my attention by a senior person from Finances that some of these irregular activities after my departure still continued.  Now I cannot confirm so I – I have not been able to independently verify that but he did report that to me and it is a very senior personfrom Finances in KwaZulu Natal.  There are – there are two matters.  The one is the R60 million corruption investigation and then the attempt to bribe me.  So what happened is Chair when he was arrested after they attempted to bribe me there was an attempt to have a disciplinary hearing on Colonel Navin Madhoe.  However he managed to obtain an interdict preventing the police  from continuing with that particular disciplinary hearing because they had followed the wrong procedures.  But that interdict only pertains to the attempt to bribe me.  Nothing up until today in spite of myself making – bringing it to the attention of senior management at SAPS nothing, absolutely nothing has happened. He is still in the same position, still doing the same work and that to me is of real concern.    Chair it was in 2011, August 2011.    I received information    A General Anwa Dramat.    I had information that I will be suspended on a specific date and that Colonel Navin Mad hoe had now been suspended for the attempt to bribe me would return on a certain date.  And those two dates I conveyed to General Dramat and lo and behold on the day that I was told that …     Madhoe had returned back to work – he returned back to office.    He was temporarily removed to another office.    But within a month or two he is placed back into his position and on the exact same date that the prediction was and those predictions came from none other than the    He predicted the exact day on which Navin Madhoe would return back to office and the day that I would receive my suspension notice.     I accept that I am still under oath Chair.    Chair as recent as    I was phoned by a Colonel in KwaZulu Natal who was desperate to talk to someone and that was a Colonel Myburgh.  Colonel Myburgh had also reported corruption emanating from the office of Colonel Navin Madhoe.  There was a protracted investigation and the nett result of that investigation was that they were going to charge the whistle-blower, Colonel Myburgh.  So I flew to Durban and I had a conversation with the Acting Provincial Commissioner General Mkhwanazi and he stopped that process.  But during that discussion I did detail to him the fact thatNavin Madhoe had managed to obtain an interdict for a disciplinary hearing pertaining to the attempted bribery but that does not preclude them from continuing with the disciplinary hearing against him for the main charge the R60 million corruption and which is fully implicated.  And that – the same applies to the captain that works with him Captain Narain Prasad.    Chair what typically happens in SAPS.     If they want to get rid of you they follow the procedure.    Or they attempt to follow the procedure.  And I am speculating now.  The way they treated the disciplinary hearing of Madhoe it was a paper exercise.  And obviously that being a paper exercise they would remand it and then they would stop it and eventually when they wanted to proceed with the matter just before I was going to give evidence he went to the labour court and applied for an interdict which was granted.  I think it was afinal order and because the police had procrastinated with the proceedings. And quite rightly so Chair I mean what is good for t he goose is good for the gander so I do not have a problem with that interdict.  The police did not follow the necessary – their own rules but the problem that I do have is in the other matters.     Absolutely nothing was done.    No.    Chair it would be the    Which I recall is Major General Ngembe.    No Chair because Madhoe does not work …    He is not with the Hawks.   He is with the as they say SAPS.    If it is brought to his attention.    I do not – Chair I do not think the current national commissioner is aware but…   Provincial management in KwaZulu Natal.    And the fact that he is still in the same post they did not even think it prudent…     To at least put him in a different department.    Where there can be no attempts to commit.   Thank you Chair.    Chair I have perused it more specifically in the passages that deals with the Booysen matter.     Indeed Chair.    That is so Chair.    Chair with regards to where my name appear in this report it correlates with th e evidence    That is my case Mr Chair.    Chair perhaps I can assist.    I am referring from page 96 to page 143.   That is correct Chair.    Chair it is 96 to 143but in addition to that…    There are also sections …     Which I highlighted and which I…    That is indeed so Chair.    Chair unfortunately it is on my phone.    Because I numbered them on my phone.     Either the transfer orthe Section 25, the golden handshake.     That is right Chair.    That is right Chair.    That is right Chair.    Chair when I returned to work I called in the investigators.  Obviously I wanted feedback as to how all these investigations had proceeded in the time that I had been    About two years Chair, just over two years.    Long time Chair.    So Chair it was clear to me that well number 1 is the attempt to bribe me by Panday and Madhoe but that matter had been withdrawn by Advocate Moipon eNoko.  The main case, the R60 million case, that case was nolle prosequi declined to prosecute by I think it was Advocate Abby Letsholo from the Durban office in spite of the fact that there was overwhelming evidence.  Chair there was even a forensic rep ort which cost the tax payer R1.93million from Price Waterhouse Cooper and which the – it isclear from that report – there were approximately 20 arch lever files and over 200 affidavits and in spite of all that overwhelming evidence Advocate Letsholo declined to prosecute.  Then there was the matter…     Sorry Chair.    Chair I will have to write it then…    I am going to second guess Chair I do not think I am going to get it right.    Price Waterhouse Cooper Chair.    No Chair whathappened just – just before I was …     Suspended the investigators told me the scope of the inves tigation was of such a nature that we would have to get forensic auditors involved and then weapplied to national head office at the time the national commissioner was the now Minister of Police.    Mr Bheki Cele.    He approved it.    And that particular report Chair SAPS was invoiced R1.93 million for that report.     The people that we were investigating.    Indeed Chair.    Chair I think it was quite a long time before I returned back to work.     Thank you Chair.    No it is – after my two weeks leave Chair I went back to work.     After Chair.    That is correct Chair and I – for that two weeks in my absence I appointed Brigadier Vlek.    Who was the secondmost senior person at the time to act in my absence for those two weeks.    Chair there was Brigadier I cannot remember his name now – Mboto, Brigadier Mboto acted in my place.    Chair I would have expected that to happen.    But it did not happen.    None whatsoever Chair.    Chair under – Chair under normal circumstances I would have been – I would  appoint a person to act in my absence if I go on vacation leave or…     But in this particular instance I think well once you are suspended you do not have any say.     That is correct Chair.    This was one of the documents that was placed before me Chair when I wanted an update from the investigators as to how th e…    I did Chair.    Chair the general gistof Advocate Noko’s report if I can summarise it?      It looks like it was written by a defence attorney rather than a prosecutor for the state.      It is as if she has looked at any possible excuse and some of the stuff she basically made up.  I mean that is why I say in one of my – paragraph 2  “Assertions are in – an aberration which lacks substance supported by credible evidence.”  Some of them are blatant untruths that she placed on record in the report.    And that was paragraph 2 of Exhibit Z[I] which is your letter?     That is paragraph 2 ofmy letter Chair.    Chair all those paragraphs are…     Are quite important because it is evident.    That is correct Chair.    Chair if I can just respond to that.  She confirms why the case against Panday and Madhoe was withdrawn the attempt to bribe me.  Then they go into the main case, the R0 million case as to why there was going to be no prosecution.  But what she does not say in this report of hers is aftershe initially withdrew the charges against Panday and Madhoe the investigators reported to me and that carried on for almost six  months that she refused to return the docket to them.     Yes Chair.    That is right Chair.    That is the case Chair.    Because that is what now led to…     Another – further suspension.    Yes Chair.    Chair I –CHAIRPERSON   I can just perhaps summarise that I…     Chair I will attempt during the lunch break to do as you request.     But I think for purposes of answering the questions.     This – I wrote this tothe newly appointed national director of public prosecutions.     Advocate Nxasana.    Yes Chair.    I then also went to General Dramat and I told him that I had written this.     This report and he said to me he had also written a report to Mr Nxasana.     That was – that was the – my position Chair.    So Chair and also at the very same time I received a phone call from the head of ICD thenIPID now the Independent Police Investigative Directorate a Mr McBride and he asked me what was going on and I gave him a report.  And because of this and the reason – also the report by Dramat and McBride I do not know whether McBride wrote a letter to Mr Nxasana or whether he paid him a visit but nevertheless I was then asked myselfand the accountant for Price Waterhouse Cooper to come to national head office where we did a presentation to Advocates from that – that Advocate Nxasana had appointed to relook – have another look at these cases that either had been withdrawn or nolle presequi.  A specific advocate was appointed. At the time it was Advocate Gerrie Nel.  He had started interviewing witnesses.  He had visited some of the witnesses in KZN and we were about to embark upon basically prosecuting the majority of the people mentioned in this investigations.  Then it was after the appointment of the – Mr – well Major General Berning Ntlemeza he was then appointed head of the Hawks.  AfterDramat had been …     That is correct Chair.    Because in that December I think it was the 24 December just prior to that…     Chair so it was 2014.    Ja 2014.  So I justreturned to work giving the reports, written these reports.  In that interim period I cannot recall the exact dates there is another Sunday Times article that appeared by the same two journalists Hofstatter and Wa Afrka.    Accusing General Dramat and General Shadrack Sabiya and there was another colonel I cannot recall his name I think it was Kumalo I am not too sure accusing them of so called rendition.    I will talk to a bitlater.  Then Dramat got suspended.    In December that year.    And immediately when after he was suspended they appointed as acting head of the Hawks Major General Berning Ntlemeza.    He acted for a periodof time and then in that period Dramat agreed with SAPS to leave SAPS on a special dispensation.  And then the post for head of the Hawks was advertised.  I applied for th at.  Myself and three others were short listed for that post.  We were flown down to the then Minister of Police Mr Nathi Nhleko’s office at Parliament to be interviewed for the post.  Ntlemeza was not there.  It was myself, two ladies and a gentleman.     We completed our interviews on the day and a month or two later Ntlemeza was appointed    Chair I do not know.    Because normallywhat he would say in public and what actually happened were two different things.  What I do know is in an o pen meeting in Polokwane the meeting with all the provincial heads.     And other senior managers from the Hawks.    He said that he did not apply for the post.    Now whether he just said that and applied or not I do not know b ut that is what he said.    Which is common cause between the two parties.    I take issue with everypoint that she makes.    In this memorandum Chair.    Chair she basically talks about case 781 was dealt with by the Specialised CommercialCrime Unit in Durban.    Panday case Chair.    Chair I do not…CHAIRPERSON   Would the Chair want me to read the…    Makes it [indistinct].    Okay thank you Chair.    She says    “Was this lawfully justified arrest or was it a way topressurise him to implicate the PC as he, Colonel Madhoe even mentions in his representation that he was being irregularly interviewed by the investigating officers so as to falsely incriminate the PC which he flatly refused.”     “I respectfully disagree with the submissions”     Of my response.  So my response I wrote Chair.“I respectfully disagree with the submission by Advocate Noko that there was no evidence to prosecute any person with any offence in the main investigation pertaining to the R60 million corruption.  The reference number in this case is Durban Central CAS 781/9/2001.  It is my submission that there is a prima facie case against Toshan Panday, Colonel Navin Madhoe as well as Captain Ashwin Narain Parsad.  For purposes of this submission I refrain from detailing the evidence in this m atter save to saythat it contains in excess of 20 lever arch files of documents more than 200 affidavits as well as a forensic audit report compiled by an independent group of auditors namely Price Waterhouse Cooper.  I find it objectionable that the Spec ialised Commercial Crime Unit from her office seeks to entertain and attach credibility to the claims of the suspects in this matter.  Quite how it was – quite how it was revealed by the SCCU that SAPS members charged with the investigation of Durban Centr al CAS781 was gunning for KZN Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Ngobeni is unclear.  This imputation in not supported by any evidence other than the contrived version of the suspect themselves.  I for one have never expressed any desire to becomethe Provincial Commissioner of KZN and neither have I applied for this position before.  In my view this is a fallacious argument since the irregularities that were investigated occurred before the – before the 10…”    That is correct Chair.      “The investigation focussed on irregularities before the – before her appointment as Provincial Commissioner.  It is thus ludicrous to believe that the suspects i.e. Panday and Madhoe in this regard.  The investigating officer could not have attempted to falsely implicate the Provincial Commissioner for a crime that took place before she assumed the post.  Her involvement in the matter relates to the attempts by her to interfere with the investigation after the – she assumed her position as Provincial Commissioner and not with regard to the procurement irregularities perse.  The conclusion  by Advocate Noko that neither Panday nor Madhoe features anywhere and I wrotethere nowhere verbatim”      “Is manifestly wrong and this conclusion ought to be challenged.  There is overwhelming evidence  tosupport a converse conclusion.  The question by Advocate Noko as to why Madhoe was arrested in a subsequent attempt to bribe me is rather rhetorical.  A reading of case 466 that is the attempt to bribe me will demonstrate beyond doubt that Advocate Nok o’s reasoning is fallacious and wrong.  I find it reprehensible that the suspects’ version of events is preferred by Advocate Noko.  This is a worrying precedent.”    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   That is what she is saying Chair.    That is right Chair.    Chair then in her    My response Chair is   I do not.    Well Chair the – and why I have a problem with that is the reasons that she advances.     There is nosubstance.    Her paragraph 2.5 of Exhibit Z[H]. “Mr Panday was even promised by SAPS members inthe 781 case that if he falsely implicate the PC that is now the Provincial Commissioner they would get rid of the 466 case.  It was further explained to Mr Panday that the benefit of this sought incrimination for the PC for them SAPS members will be that the PC will be forced to resign and then Major General Booysen will become the next KZN Provincial Commissioner.Further Major General Deena Moodley would remain in control  of the Secret fund.”     In Exhibit 2[I].     “Other than the claimants by the suspects in this matter who had much to lose had the investigation led to a prosecution and conversely much to gain should they have managed to derail the investigation there is no evidence whatsoever to remotely support her claims contained in this paragraph.  In any eventwhy would the Provincial Commissioner be forced to resign if she knew the evidence against her were contrived?  Furthermore there is no guarantee that I would succeed her as a Provincial Commissioner presupposing that she had resigned.  For this or anyother reason he vacant p ost would have been advertised and prospective candidates evaluated for possible appointment.  It is my submission that Panday and Company have failed to compromise me.  They have attempted to have the investigation stopped. The Deputy National Commissione r for the Hawks Lieutenant General Dramat is aufait with the detail.  When this allegation failed they brought in an unsuccessful application the high court to thwart the investigation and after they failed to bribe me withR2 million in cash they have obv iously run out of ideas.  To now suggest an agenda by myself to become Provincial Commissioner at the expense of Lieutenant General Ngobeni is not supported by any evidence and ought to be rejected.  Lieutenant General Ngobeni has no control over the Secre t fund.  If I had to succeed her the situation would remain the same.  To postulate that Major General Moodley would therefore remain in control of the Secret fund    Chair I think she is dealing here with the main R60 million case.     And then 2.6 of Noko’s letter.     “The matter 781 matter – the 781 matter which formsthe basis and reason for the alleged co rruption of Major General Booysen by Colonel Madhoe was found to be non-existent by the SCCU.”     Chair I do not – I do not think she knows what she is saying here.  I –    My response thereto    Then her 2.7 Chair.“Major General Booysen is the complainant and the only witness in the 466 case against Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe.  The very Panday and Colonel Madhoe who allegedly refused to pave the way for him to become the next KZN SAPS Provincial Commissioner by refusing to falsely implicate the current Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Ngobeni.” 2.7 of my response thereto Chair. “I am not the complainant in the matter of DurbanCentral CAS 466 that is the bribery.  This is a disingenuous proposition by Advocate Noko so as to build a legend for her imputations contained in paragraph 2.8 and 2.9 info.  For one the state is the complaint in the corruption matter.  I am merely one of the many witnesses.  Advocate Noko clearly does not understand my role in this investigation.  She also chooses to ignore the fact that the Durban Central CAS 781 investigation was initiated by none other than the financial head in the provinceBrigadier Lawrence Kemp.  It is inconceivable that Brigadier Kemp knew about my aspirations as alleged by Advocate Noko unless he obviously colluded with me to discredit the Pro vincial Commissioner.Had Advocate Noko howeverbothered to examine Brigadier Kemp’s statement in Durban Central CAS 781 she would have established the origin and source of the entire investigation.”     Her 2.8 Chair. “The 466 case, the bribery case is investigated by the members of the police who fall under the command of Booysen who is the complainant in the 466 case.  Their objective dealing with the case becomes questionable especially with this – with theCato Manor case cloud hanging over their heads.  This I believe would shake their credibility and the court would view all these in favour of the two Mr Panday and Colonel Madhoe.”  My response thereto Chair. “Advocate Noko has been [indistinct] in stating that the investigating officers objectivity are questionable especially with the Cato Manor case cloud hanging over their heads.  The investigating officers in these    Her 2.9 Chair. “Major General Booysen being the complainant in the 466 case interfered with an exercise control in this case even going to an extent of determining anddeciding who visits Colonel Madhoe when he was detained in the Durban Central police c ells in the 466 case.  This is exhibited by the letter that was issued on his direct instruction to the Durban Central police station Brigadier V R Stokes.  This letter dated September 2011 addressed to all relief commanders and cell commanders and titled Visitation Durban Central CAS 466 N Madhoe provided that – provided that the …”     “They did to even know what this report has against them especially Colonel Madhoe who was then aprocurement official who processed the accommodation documents leading to  the 781 case.” My response to that Chair. “Advocate Noko chooses to be deliberately obtuse for one there is indeed a strong prima facie case against Madhoe and Panday in Durban 781.  The [indistinct] by Colonel Madhoe and Mr Panday to derail the investigation in 781 emanates from the unsuccessful application to have the Section 205 subpoenas set aside.  Although the report in questionitself does not contain prima facie evidence of a crime being committed predating the report to a date before the application for the Section 205 case have rendered the 5’s and subsequent evidence obtained inadmissible.  Information in this report contained evidence gleaned as a result of the 205’s in other words if I had predated this report it would have had meant that the  investigators had obtained information legally before obtaining the Section 205 subpoenas.  Advocate Noko rightly indicated thatColonel Madhoe was from the procurement section.  He had inadequate legal knowledge to argue the points raised by Advocate Nok o her sentence one would expect that they would know what is contained in 781 case against them as they are part of it theywould know what they did to even know what this report has against them especially Colonel Madhoe who was then the procurement offic ial who processed the accommodation document leading to the 781 case and then I say is incoherent and difficult to understand.  For instance how and why would Panday and Madhoe know what is contained in 781?  They were the suspects in the matter not the investigators.  Furthermore they knew exactly what was contained in the report since they had illegallyobtained it.  Two copies of the report were found in Madhoe’s vehicle on two separate occasions.  A third copy of the report had fingerprints that matched  those of Panday on it. All this evidence is contained in the dockets and for some unknown reason appears not to have been considered.”     2.11 of Noko’s memorandum Chair.     “Once again – once again the last sentence in thisparagraph in inverted commas “this however indicates a history of some sort of – shared by Madhoe and Booysen now they are complainant and accused in the 466 case respectively.  It is incoherent and difficult to understand.”  12. – 2. 12 of her memorandum.  “There is an assumption that is not substantiated by evidence that Mr Panday is part of the alleged bribing of Booysen and Madhoe.  This assumption is derived from the position that they both are suspectsin 781 case.  This will not stand in court as evidence for corruption against them.”     Chair this is clearly a communication between Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa and Chair I just want to say something about Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshw a not to confuse matters.    There is another    From Gauteng.    I think that was pursuant to the conversations they had about the signing of documents which Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa seems to have been reluctant todo.    That is right Chair.    And there were alsoother issues that they expected him to do.  But Chair the second to last    Which would havebeen inappropriate.    That is so Chair.    A few months later –    It does Chair.    That is correct Chair.    In this diagram.    There were a number of investigations.    Which I have testified about.      The Amigo case whichI have testified about.    The Cato Manor investigation which relates to the investigation against myself and Cato  Manor.    And then also the looting of the Secret Services account case.     The point I am makinghere Chair is that invariably in all these cases th e same prosecutors appear as prosecutors.    For the state.    Well in the Panday investigations certain prosecutors – let me start with the Cato Manor one Chair.  The prosecutors that I have mentioned under Cato Manor also figure in the withdrawal of charges in the Panday matter and the Amigos case.  Also included in my statement Chair which is not part ofthis diagram is that in other cases that I hav e knowledge of such as the so called rendition case against Shadrack Sibiya the general and General Anwa Dramat which subsequently also led to the suspensions of Mr McBride for a so called second report that he had changed.      Inevitably the same prosecutors are always involved with those prosec utions.  On the one hand they prosecute people like myself.     Pravin Gordhan, Johan Van Loggenberg, Anwa Dramat, Shadrack Sibiya, Mr McBride,Sesoko, Ncuba.  I cannot recall who the prosecutor against G lynnis Breytenbach was.  So you have this group of prosecutors always involved in the prosecutions of people that are busy with investigations of corruption.    In this – in the SARS matter Mr Johan Van Loggenberg, Ivan Pillay and Pravin Gordhan that has been well documented in the media.  They were running a parallel investigation into some of the subjects that we were investigating…     It is just – I just find it very odd that the same prosecutors.     And then the same – some of the same prosecutors are then involved in the withdrawal of charges against people that we have been investi gating and that    Chair I am scared that    And that is …      I will just refer to it Chair I will not read it.    So Chair I have – what I have done is I have – I am naming certain prosecutors.    But enabled state capturing.    And then after that I deal with specific individuals within the Hawks.     That I would sayenabled state capture.    And then also to a lesser extent.    Members who enabled state capture.    So Chair if I should start.    I do Chair.    Now their focus should be genocide, crimes against humanity, Fore ign Military Assistance Act, Intelligence Services Act and International Terrorism.The point I want to make here is that I find it very strange that some of the prosecutors from this – from the PCLU would involve themselves with investigations against th e likes of McBride, Dramat, Shadrack Sibiya for cases I will not say that are not serious but they are relatively much less serious than the things that they should be dealing with.  Such…     For instance they would prosecute certain people that I have now mentioned for fraud.  That does not fall into the remit of what they should be doing in thefirst place.    Yes.    Absolutely Chair and Iwill refer to this later on again when I talk about Law Enforcement.     Within the Hawks you have and I will deal with that later.     Also involving themselves.    With these I would – Iwill not call them menial investigations.     But much less serious investigations.    Chair I just want to point out this statement of mine I deposed to last year November already.    Well I compiled in lastyear November already.    And in this statement of mine I mention that those prosecutors should be dealing with cases and that is before I hear d the evidence of Mr Agrizzi.  I did not evenknow who Mr Agrizzi was.  And here in my statement I said that they should be – should have been dealing with matters such as Bosasa, state captures.    The Gupta’s, Steinhoff.    All those cases which seriously affected the economy of the country.     Some of them.    And – but they work closely together with the prosecutors that I will address.     In my – in mystatement.    He would have to deal with that Chair because I actually accuse him also of lying under oath, and I have invited him to file a fourth set of papers, to dispute what I am saying that he is not conversant in Greek.     Chair I filed my founding affidavit in 2016 immediately after I was re-arrested and prosecuted.      These proceedings have been occasioned by delay after delay occasioned by the National Prosecuting Authority.    First they filed therecord, because we asked for the rule 53 record, which they filed.  A week later they added material.    To the record.    After I filed my supplementary affidavit they filed more so -called evidence.    More materials.  To the extent that I think it was in 2017 or – ja 2017 Chair where they undertook that because Advocate Jiba also had to file an affidavit, they then undertook I think that was roundabout August that she would fileby August.      When August came they dumped a whole lot of new material which she said she had forgotten about.    Which she had also considered five years prior to that.     By now that was thethird time that they had added material to the record.     And we did not agree with that because that is not what the Rule 53 requires of the prosecutors.  And then we suggested to them that they should apply forcondonation.  They refused.    We then told them well you will have to.  And eve ntually they conceded that they will have to apply for condonation.  I think that was around about October, November.  But in spite of agreeing…     17 Chair.    But in spite of that –of them agreeing to file – to apply for condonation and I think it was November they only filed it in February the following year.     Eventually Chair we – we applied to have the – the matter struck off the role because we have appeared 20 times which 18 times I think we were in the high court.     And the case has not commenced yet.    The matter was not struck off the role.  The judge then Judge Lobe said what he is going todo he is going to take charge of these processes and he gave certain timelines.    All of us have adhered to those timelines.    So the NPA and so did we except on one or two occasions where we would engage with each other because the papers were quite comprehensive.     Now Chair so obviously there is a new bus driver for lack of a better phrase.     So in the current NDPP will have to decide whether she wants to proceed with thematter.    And which event if she wants to proceed with the matter.    Then Advocate Abrahams, Myema and Jiba will have to file.     File a fourth set of    That is fine by meChair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTE MBER:  Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  We have legal representatives?     But should General Booysen perhaps be sworn in again or is it not necessary?     Not at all.  I am just pointing itout that that is one of the aspects .    Thank you Chair.  It was your evidence that you then returned to work following the finding of Advocate Nazeer Cassim?     If I may then take him through the points as he referenced it?     And his objections to it.CHAIRPERSON   No problem Chair.      There appears in the middle of the page an email and I shall read from Advocate KMA Chauke sent 12    So Chair will recall thatMosing’s version – just missed it now.  Mosing’s version without de…     And without detracting from the particularity of detail in here the report continues to deal with the evaluation of racketeering case law on page 130.     Yes Chair.    But as to the notes in itself I do    It is an annexure of the report Chair and it is quite a detailed chronology of events.     Because the witness – this particular witness certainly alludes to  certain allegations in relation to    As it pleases Chair.  I am happy to then exclude such portions and deal with the rest of them if I may?     Yes.CHAIRPERSON
ADV YANGA LUDIDI:  Morning, morning Chair.    My name is Yanga Ludidi from the office of thestate attorney.   Yes I am here to represent Major General Mnonopi and Advocate Mtolo.    Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I have noted what you have said DCJ    And I will discuss it with you later.    As to how it can be dealt with.    Any change in any system withthe commission unfortunately takes time.     And one would not want that to be disrupted.    Yes.    Yes.   Now I understand that.  It is a concern.    And we will have to address it.    Yes.  No it is a valid point.    And we will investigate it.    This is the first time that I have become aware of this circumstance.     Thank you Chair.    Certainly Chair.  It is your    Understood.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV JN MALINGA:  Good morning Chair.    My name is [indistinct] Malinga.  I am from MalingaAttorneys.    I would like to put myself on record on behalf of Brigadier Ncaba.    Ncaba.    That is correct Chair.    As well as Lieutenant General Matakata. CHAIRPERSON   Lieutenant General Matakata.    Thank you Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Is blissfully aware.    I confirm that Chair.    I confirm that Chair.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER   (No audible reply).    It does Chair.    I confirm that Chair.    I confirm that Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I have – I have read this passage from the inquiry.  I can confirm that the evidence that that was led at the inquiry - not by myself.  It was a statement by Advocate Mamabolo.  I confirm the procedure that he describes in his affidavit.  In my experience I was surprised to see that this procedure was not followed in – in the Booysen matter.  As head of the Hawks in KZN the procedure – and I am going to try and use an analogy of a narcotics investigation.    This advocate and the investigators would then at regular meetings that we have in terms of progress in projects would then allude to the fact that this might be a case for racketeering.   That advocate will then basically give instructions to the investigator.     As to what evidence isrequired.    That is right Chair.  Once they are satisfied from my office we will then contact the National Office.     At the National Office previously I would – I actually dealt with Advocate  Mamabolo and Advocate Johan Kruger.  They were dealing with the desk wherethrough these racketeering cases had to go before it is presented to the NDPP.    For authorisation in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act.     In my experience and the Savoi or the Amigos case is a case in point.   Where theinvestigators were sent back several times to – from National to – to obtain more and relevant evidence to – to establish the enterprise number one.    And number two tolink the individuals to the enterprise.   Individually – individually and collectively.    So – and it is true what Mamabolo says - Advocate Mamabolo says in his statement.    He says normally that procedure would take 14 days.   Chair if you look at the correspondence the application t o prosecute myself and Cato Manor for racketeering I think landed on the desk of Advocate – I think is Anthony Mosing at the time and within a day I think it landed on his desk on the 15 t h.    And on the 17 t h the racketeering charges were authorised.     So it is.    Absolutely.    Chair.   No Chair I did not.  I might have mentioned it in my founding affidavit Chair or in any of my supplementary affidavits in the review application.     But I cannot recall specifically asking why was.   My matter dealt with.    So quickly within a space of one day as opposed to.   Other cases that I personally dealt with.    With my investigators.  That normally took longer than two weeks.     Advocate Mamabolo says 14 days.  In some instance it actually took much longer than that.   I have never pertinently asked the question.    And I have never given – well obviously never got an answer.    No, I did not Chair.    I suspect I mighthave.    Chair but.    Over the last sixyears I made.  Six founding affidavits, replying affidavits and supplementary affidavits.     So I might have mentioned it.  So (intervenes).    I will check.  I do have all the affidavits.    Chair.    That is so Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair basically what happened is photographs were used by the Sunday Times and the two journalists responsible for that were Stephan  Hofstatter and Mzilikazi wa Afrika.  Now Chair would recall when I testified when Colonel Madhoe attempted to bribe me when I met him the first time.  He showed me certain photographs.    And I do not think it is any coincidence that those very same photographs were the photographs that eventually appeared in the Sunday Times.     Well Chair it is – it stands to reason.  I saw the photographs well not all of them.  There was a whole file.    On the – on the laptop that Navin Madhoe showed me.    And I also had a discussion with Mr Stephan Hofstatter in my office.   Before they published the article.    And I still took issue with him and I said to him look the photographs that you guys have not all those people were shot by Cato Manor.   And the one – probably the most gruesome picture was the one of – I think – four or five people deceased on the back of a bakkie.     Where Cato Manor had not been involved.  They actually tendered to – to the scene.    So I – I found it very suspicious that the very same photographs that were used.     To put pressure on me now all of a sudden appear in the Sunday Times.    And the reason why I am saying that is it - it later became evident.    That it was indeed amember from Crime Intelligence that colluded with the Sunday Times.  There were also intercepted communications between Panday – Toshan Panday.   And Mzilikazi wa Afrika.  Where certain photographs and CD discs were promised which obviously I – which I    So it was clear to me Chair and there was also a statement and I cannot recall the name of the person who actually stole the photos.  Chair these photographs were actually photographs at Cato Manor.   On the computer system which they logged.    Those photographscame from – from the dockets – the case dockets.    And the reason why those photographs were kept is the number of instances where – where robberies had been committed and incidentally we had one last nightwhere a person shot a police Colonel about  three months ago in Durban and this very same person was shot and killed last night in Johannesburg during a robbery case.  So that is one of the reasons why they keep those – those albums.    To identify suspects who had been – who had become deceased.    Who were involved in    There is a statement in one of the dockets where the person w ho stole these photographs – it was done so at the behest of Colonel Madhoe with the involvement of another Colonel Rajen Aiyer.    So the only escapable conclusion one could come to is.    Those photographs were shown to me on the computer to put pressure on me.     There is evidence that they were stolen for a particular purpose and the next moment.     So that is why I come to that conclusion.    Chair I asked himwhat it was all about.    Because it did not make sense to me.  He showed me photographs which I could probably give – given him thousands of.    And then he just said to me no, no he can get some more of these.    It is at that pointwhere he closed the laptop and he said no he can get more of these photographs.  I said to him well get more.     He did not give me an explanation Chair.    Yes Chair.   No, no.    That is my conclusion Chair.    Chair if I include the disciplinary hearing and the SCA matter that was aband oned by SAPS I think it is probably about seven or eight times but to court - to High Court and Labour Court I think six or seven times.     Very expensive Chair.    Chair just after the Sunday Times article appeared in December 2011.  Officially we had the Christmas period then nothing happened during December.  Then early and I think it was early February I received a notice of intention to suspend me and I had to advance reasons why I should not be suspended.    2012 Chair.    No that came from national Chair.    At that time no.  It was from General Dramat.  So Chair early/mid-February I received this notice of intention to suspend but the notice was very vague.  So I wrote to SAPS and I said look I need more information to make a meaningful representation.  I cannot make a representation if I do not know why I am suspended and I received a letter back from.    That is indeed the case Chair.    I still said to the General – he handed me the suspension – suspension notice.  I said well there is an interdict and she just shrugged her shoulders and I – I phoned my attorney right there and then and I proceeded to his office and we worked throughout the night to apply for an – for an urgent court order to set aside the suspension – to declare it unlawful Chair.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Chair in my view de facto it was him.    No de juro it was him but de facto it was someo ne else.    Hm.   I think I will.    Probably later on in my.  Because I firmly believe that.    General Dramat wasunder pressure from the then Minister Nathi Mthethwa.    The Minister of Police at the time.    Explain that later on.    So Chair just to recap I obtained an interdict.    Against SAPS not to suspend me.   Unless they provide me with the necessary information that I require to make a meaningful representation.    They do not supply all of the information.    We correspond to and fro and we tell them we are not happy with response.  The next momentthey suspend me.    I immediately went back to court and I applied for the suspension to be declared unlawful and to be set aside.   I recall it was a public holiday the following day and the – the Judge still said look this is a public holiday.  It is not going to impact on the applicant – myself.    And that he is giving SAPS until 3 o’ clock that following afternoon to tell him why he should not grant the order.    And 3 o’ clock thefollowing afternoon I received a call from my attorney wherein SAPS requested me to withdraw my application.     And they will withdraw the – the suspension which I declined.  I said no I would like to see them in court and you can make  – we will make it an order of the court.     Chair not much of what they did at the time made sense.     And I insisted that I    And have it declared unlawful.    And we went to court the following day and my suspension was set aside and the contempt proceedings against SAPS was remanded sine die.    Well I had broughtthem simultaneous.    Yes Chair.    That is indeed thecase Chair.     Chair then I wentback to work and ...(intervention)      Chair they were remanded sine die, I did not pursue that for the simple reason I was bogged down with litigation and it was basically a fight for survival so I never pursued that.       Chair at one stage I did canvas this with my attorney, Mr van der Merwe, an d – but that was much later when I had more time and he said to me look Johan I don’t think it’s going to be appropriate at such a late stage to pursue this so I just left it.     I abandoned it Chair.     Chair then – sorry which month?   Chair after my suspension was set aside I went back to work and continued with the investigations and then in September 2012 I was a rrested.  I was detained for one night, went to Court the following day, released on bail, bail was not opposed and I went back to work and then about a week or two later I was suspended again and this time Chair I thought it would be a futile exercise to now again try and set aside the suspension because that suspension went hand in hand with me being arrested for a criminal offence.     Chair no in terms of the police regulations once you are suspended the disciplinary hearing should commence within 60 days, so there was no disciplinary hearing, what in fact happened is when I – in the meantime I had taken the Jiba authorisation on review and then after Judge Gorvan ruled in my favour I said I am going back to work now and then that following week, it was during the evening I was served with papers and that was – I still recall I think it was 600 days later instead of 60 days  later.       Two years later Chair.     Chair when the hearing started we raised the point in limine objecting to the procedure being followed.  The Chairperson overruled us and then I said to myattorney let’s just place it on record, if the finding eventually is adverse to me then at least we can take it on review, we have placed it on record.  Fortunately it tur ned out that I was exonerated during that disciplinary hearing which lasted six months.    It was senior counsel, Advocate Naseer Cassiem.     That was the finding Chair.     Colonel he – sorry Chair he is the key witness in the racketeering case.  I am being charged under (e) and (f) of POCA and (f) being that I managed the enterprise.  So whereas he w as the actual unit commander at the timehe now becomes a witness against me, I don’t know how he can be a witness, he should have been a 204 witness, but he is now the key witness against myself and some of the Cato Manor members in that we managed a criminal enterprise.  His statements were ventilated in the matter, the review matter which I brought in front of Judge Gorvan and my contention at the time was that the statement that he had made at the time, well he made three Chair and all three are very in coherent to say the least.  It related to office politics, there was no indication of any offence being committed whatsoever and my assertion was confirmed by Judge Gorvan that it only relates to office politics andmuch later when Advocate Abrahams became  the NDPP he procured a legal opinion from two of his advocates, one being a senior advocate, Advocate Jan Ferreira and Advocate Van Eeden in which they had to – well they had to give him a legal opinion as to why they should proceed with criminal charges against Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba for – in mymatter, and in that particular legal opinion which I managed to obtain because it became part of court papers in another application by one of these non-governmental organisations, in that particular legal opinion  both those advocates from the National Prosecuting Authority actually confirms, or they don’t confirm they agree with what Judge Gorvan have said, and what I have said confirmed by Judge Gorvan that it only relates to office politics and it’s this very sa me Colonel Aiyer that Advocate Sean Abrahams is still relying on because he much later and I will testify about that later, in spite of the court order he authorised my     That is indeed the case Chair.   Chair it was reinstated I think February 2016.     Chair I have now been exonerated by Advocate Cassiem in a disciplinary hearing, the Court had found that there was no case against me, and fortunately for myself the Constitutional Court then at that time with the Glynnistermatter said that myself would now report to the National Head a nd the National Head to the Minister, whereas in the previous era am I to report to both the Provincial Commissioner and to the National Head, and the National Head of the Hawks also had to report to the National Commissioner, so that was all taken out of the equation, so I decided, I phoned General Dramat and I said look I am going back to work now, and he agreed with me.  I then received a phone call from General Dramat that I need to come to Pretoria where I had to meet with him and the then National Commissioner Riah Phiyega.  General Phiyega called me to her office, myself and Dramat and she gave me threeoptions, she said to me either you must remain at home on special leave or you should take a transfer or if you take a Section 35, Section 35 is a golden handshake, I still had three years left in the police service so she was prepared to pay me out for three years and then I said to her well ...(intervention)      Chair it’s actuallyworse than that because at that stage I had already been sitting at home for two years, so another three, so the State would have had to pay me, and despite what a lot of people say the police generals get a generous salary, the taxpayer would have to pay myself sitting at home     That’s indeed the case Chair.       That’s what she offered me Chair.     So Chair she asked me so what did you decide so I said to her option number one is not an option, I am not going to stay at home any longer, I have been sitting athome for two years already and then she said to me option number two, I said I am not going to take a transfer, then she said to me so I give you a lawful instruction to transfer you you’re going to – you’re not going to comply with my instruction.  I said no that’s not what I’m saying, so she what are you saying I said well if you transfer me I will take the matter to court.  Sh e said why, I said because you cannot transfer me.  Then she said to me well who can transfer you.  I said General Dramat can transfer me in terms of the Glynnister judgment.  Then she asked General Dramat what do you say General, and then he said to her no he agrees with me, at which point she – well then thewhole tide changed, then she started arguing with him, and then when it got to the point of the Section 35, the Golden Handshake, then she said to me what about that option, I said no I am not going t o take that either, and then she said to me why not, I said well I’m still reasonably fit and young and I think I can still make a contribution to fight crime in KZN and at that time the cash in transit heists and the political killings had spiralled out of control and I said to her crime is out of control in KZN, she said how can you say that.  I said well your own Divisional Commissioner as recent as last week made a statement in the Daily News newspapers that he needs to send task teams to KZN to deal wi ththese crime matters, and then she said to me before I excuse you is there anything else you would like to say, so I said no there is something I would like to say, I got up and I said I will be back in my office tomorrow and then I walked out and then I  had to wait for General Dramat and I could hear through the walls that it wasn’t apleasant meeting.  Then Dramat eventually came out and we left and he said to me Phiyega wants to know what makes me tick, I said what makes me tick is let me do my work, that’s what makes me tick.  He said to me that she has requested that I don’t go back to work and that I take two weeks leave.      Chair they just didn’t want me back at the office.  They just di dn’t want me back at the office.     Chair General Dramat is a very soft spoken person, and he is not confrontational.  But he was 0% behind me going back to work and I agreed with him I said to him look what I will do is I will take two weeks leave, but I am going to go back to my office, I am going to report back for duty, because I know how they operate, if you stay away then they will say no you acquiesced to the process of staying away now you’re back so I said I will go back to work then I am going to apply for leave for two weeks, I am going to send it to you, you must approve it, that means I am backat work.  Then he said to me how can we overcome this impasse, I said let General Nkombeni, the Provincial Commissioner at the time, let us all have a round table with the National Commissioner, let’s sort this thing out.  So a month later we had this meeting and this meetingturned into a debacle, to say the the lease.     Yes Chair.     Yes.     So they convenedthis meeting with General Phiyega, General Makubela, who has  since passed away, General Dramat, there was another General from Legal Services, I cannot recall her name, she was sitting across, and I could see from her demeanour that she wasn’t even interested in listening because she knew what was going on was wron g, she was on her phone, I don’t know whether she was texting or blaming games or whatever but she had no interest in this meeting and quite rightly so, and then Chair it wasn’t a meeting, the more I tried to ...(intervention)      It was General RiahPhiyega, General Dramat, who was with me, and General Makubela who is a lady, she subsequently passed away.      She was also there.     That’s right Chair, yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON But he was not present on the day that the four of us were interviewed.     And whether he hadapplied and whether they had a separate session with him I do not know.    I would say about amonth or two Chair.    He was appointed.  Chair and the [intervenes].  They were there    There were four of us there Chair.    Chair.    Chair within I would say a week after his – his permanent appointment as Head of theHawks I received another notice of intention to suspend me.     And I think he was appointed permanently perhaps in July the following year.     Give or take a month or two.    Once again Chair.    Well Chair this time around he - he accused me of committing fraud.   And what is interesting more or less at the same time he also accused    He was eventually prosecuted and.    Acquitted.CHAIRPERSON   In my matter I wrote a letter – well in my presentation I think.    Yes Chair.    The fraud.    The fraud related to amonetary award Chair that was written by the Commander of Cato Manor.    For work done by his members.    In the investigation of the killing of Colonel Chonco.    The killing of Choncoone of the suspects that was sought by Cato Manor Magojela Ndimande.    They were looking for    I received information from an informer that he was on his way to Pietermaritzburg.     I conveyed that to Cato Manor.    They got hold of the surveillance unit to manage to track down Ma gojela Ndimande.  The surveillance unit then informed Cato Manor that he was on the freeway. Subsequent to that there was a chase on the freeway where – whereby Magojela was shot and killed and his.     He had a bodyguard with an AK47.    Who was also shot and killed.    So my role played inthe tracing of Magojela was detailed in that report.   A number of detectives and I will guess probably about 18 to 20 detectives.     Somewhere in the – in the report there is a wrong date.    So.    Hm.CHAIRPERSON   Chair it is not really a performance bonus.  It is – police regulations make provision where police officers did exceptional work.     That they can be awarded with a certificate or a medal or.     Or a monetary award.    That is correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   That is the same monetary award that that Judge  Mokgoro refers to Chair.    Chair it is not a claim.     It is an application.    In terms of those regulations.  So the Unit Commander detailed the names of people who had been part of thisinvestigation.    And he sent that to me but my – and the process is I would send that to my superior.     He will send to the Provincial Commissioner who was General (indistinct).    He has a committee  He eventually approves.  It goes to National Head Office.   Where Deputy National Commissioners – more than one.    Sits on a panel and then they will eventually agree or disagree.     And awarded each of    Award.  The problem according to Ntlemeza was that there was a date that was wrong.     But if you read the things sequentially it is clear that it is a typographical error.     I wrote a detailedreport and I said to him it is clear from that it is a typographical error.     And I actually pointed out and his notice of intention to s uspend me – he has also made similar mistakes.    And in spite of – of a detailed report he nevertheless suspended me.     No, I did not.  Chairthat is just the point.  I never signed the document.     Because I was a possible recipient.  I did not feel comfortable signing that document.     Recommending.    Be awarded.    But I deleted my name.    At the bottom.CHAIRPERSON And I put the General Brown’s name there.    He then dealt with thematter.    He recommended to.  The Provincial Commissioner.    Absolutely nothing    Chair in.    Chair.    Maybe if I can explain it this way.  I took that decision to suspend me on review as we ll.    And in – this time tothe High Court.    And the Judge on that matter - I think it was Judge Van Zyl.    Let alone by the applicant.    I also told him in myrepresentation Chair that what he is saying in his  notice of intention to suspend.    That he is actually misrepresenting facts.    That could possibly prejudice me.    And that he will makehimself guilty of an offence of fraud if he does that.   And I did subsequently open a fraud case against him.     But he – in spite of the fact that I am – it is – it is evident Chair if you read my report that there - there is just no reason or there is just no valid reason for him to have suspended me.    That is the judgment Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair a few things happened.  Ntlemeza applied for leave to appeal the Van  Zyl judgment which was refused and then he petitioned the SCA.  In that interim period I indicated that I am going back to work again, but he th en indicated (indistinct) Le serve papers on me for another disciplinary hearing.    Chair the very first one was the interdict that I got because they did not give me enoughinformation.    And they suspended me in spite of the interdict.  I then had that overturned.    The second time was when I was arrested.  I was suspended.  I did not challenge that forobvious reasons.    Hm.    Then there was a disciplinary inquiry in which I was exonerated.     That is correct Chair.    Hm.    It would be the third one Chair.    Of which I challenged two.    No Chair he – no he did suspend me.    Well Chair so what    At that point I had been approached by a private sector.     For – and I was sitting at home doing nothing and the matter – I was due to retire July  2017.    And the matter was set down for the SCA for March  2017.  And fill in my retirement papers.    And that – I indicated to SAPS that if they are prepared to release me now I am prepared togo.    They agreed.    I think they were veryhappy to get rid of me.    Or some – some individuals within SAPS.     And I was – I went – I left the police in February.    And.    And I was supposed to have left in July that year.  So they paid me out.     For that period of time as well.    That was part of the –well Ntlemeza then indicated then that if that is the case they will not.     Proceed with the SCA application.  Basically telling General Ntlemeza that the way they dealt with this matter is not the way that the SCA works.    Because.    That was the same Colonel Padayachee Chair.    Chair at the time when I was still at the office before all my problems started the actual DPP at the time was the current NDPP Advocate  Shamila Batohi.  She then took up the position at the International Court at The Hague and Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa was appointed as the Acting DPP in KZN.  Mlotshwa – I did not personally know him at the time but I knew about him.    Unbeknown to me and I only established this much later.  This came out that during that same period that I was busy with these investigations.   Advocate Mlotshwa received a phone call from the then Acting NDPP    And – where she said to him that because of pressure and urgency there are certain documents that he had to sign.    He was on his way to Port Shepstone to court and he indicated to her when he arrives back at the office he will have a look at it and if all the necessary documents are there that he would sign the documents.  It turns out that it – there is other a covering letter or the actual indictment to have myself andCato Manor members prosecuted for racketeering.  On his arrival back at the office there was only the letter to sign with no supporting documents.    He then wrote anemail to I think it was Advocate Chauke.    It would have been a recommendation Chair.    Yes.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I will have to guess but it was not very long after that.     Now Chair a lot ofthings happened simultaneously now because there is Mlotshwa’s refusal to withdraw charges against M abuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.    There is his refusal to sign documents for our prosecution and the next moment he gets replaced by Advocate Moipone Noko.    The - well there were two indictments.  The first one I think was signed by – I think it was unsigned but I think the covering letter was signed by Advocate  Noko.    That is.    Yes.    Well not authorised Chair.    It was recommendedto.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Chair somewhere in this exhibit here.    ZG where I think (intervenes).    Make such a finding.    There is a reference to that.    Judge when.    Yes.  It is in the judgment where she is – where the Judge actually comments that.   Noko did what Mlotshwa had refused to do.    Can you just rephrase the question please?    No Chair not – not personal over and above what I have read in this finding by    Chair I have got (intervenes).  Well Chair threesignificant things happen.  She gets appointed within two weeks.  She withdraws the Amigo case charges against Mabuyakhulu and Peggy Nkonyeni.    About two or threemonths later she withdraws the charges against Toshan  Panday.    And company.    And if one looks at the timeline it is during that same timeline.     Unbeknown to me then but known to me now.    Yes Chair.     No, no then it was Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba.     I was arrested Chair and then served with indictment.     That’s the paragraph I was referring to Chair.     I don’t want to comment specifically because some of the stuff I only realised and     I do Chair.     Chair normally, as I’ve said earlier on in my evidence, once the desk at the National Prosecuting Authority, for instance advocate Mabolo and advocateKruger, if they are satisfied that all requirements are met a meeting is then – or a session is then set down with the NDPP, at that session she’s presented or he is presented with a prosecution memorandum.  How it normally works in practice is that they wi ll also do a PowerPoint presentation and go through that in order – there are decided cases, and I think it was in the Moodley matter where it’s not a prerequisite to read all the dockets and statements.  So just a factual report how the accused are linked.     That’s correct Chair.     And based on that ifshe’s then happy or he’s then happy that the crime of racketeering had been committed he or she will then authorise the prosecution.      The one that’s signed by advocate Noko?    Chair I think I just need to correct something.If you look at this memorandum...(intervention).     Ja, that’s the secondone she signed or a second prosecution.  I’m referring to the covering letter – the covering minute in the first application for my authorisation.      Chair I would like tobe 100 percent accurate, I’d much rather look at the document first.      I’m not too sure whether it’s in the bundle Chair I’ve seen it somewhere.      That’s correct Chair so you have the prosecution memorandum and the PowerPoint presentation which basically encapsulates w hat’s contained in the memorandum.     Which file are we innow?     Page?     That’s my affidavit Chair.     That’s also myaffidavit Chair.     They are unsigned Chair but those affidavits – the original ones with my signature on are in the police dockets.     Chair yes I normally keep copies because in these type of investigations, and it has already happened, that statements seem to disappear so I keep copies and I     I did Chair and I handed them in as part of my statement, I confirm that they are     Chair when I was prosecuted the second time, obviously then we app lied in terms of Rule 53 for the record of decision and part of that then – the record would be then the memorandum and the PowerPoint presentation.  When I went through the PowerPoint presentation and the prosecution memorandum it was blatantly clear to m e that both advocate Mahemawho was responsible for preparing the prosecution memorandum, the second one, and advocate Noko who worked with him at the time – I was under the impression that she did the PowerPoint presentation but it was later pointed out in court papers that advocate Mahema prepared both, but she just represented it with him to the NDPP at the time.Chair if you go through – now in my experience, and I’ve done a number of these, if you send a docket to the public prosecutor for a decision and you do a memorandum, you write a (indistinct) of what each witness will say and you’ll describe the evidence for the prosecution and for the defence and this particular memorandum, or this particular memorandum is permeated with misrepresentations as t o what the witnesses (indistinct), there are serious omissions that should have formed part of the prosecution memorandum but most importantly Chair it contains falsehoods.  In some instances advocate – and one would not say this lightly on a platform like  this Chair, but I will say it,advocate Mahema blatantly lies in the prosecution memorandums and I can prove it. He says things that is part of the evidence that’s nowhere to be found in the dockets it just does not exist.  I deposed of these two affidavits and I opened criminal cases against advocate Mahema and Noko for committing fraud because the misrepresented what is contained in the dockets and because of that myself and the State having prejudiced.  Chair if one go into my statement – or one can have a look at the memorandum and go paragraph by paragraph what I describe I’ll just cite one example.  Mahema, for instance will write in the prosecution memorandum to Shaun Abrahams – advocate ShaunAbrahams that Booysen, that’s myself and one of the peopl e from Kato Manor, Warrant Officer Paul Mostert, he says in the memorandum that Booysen and Mostert conspired to kill Colonel Ntonko.  Chair there’s nothing of that nature in the docket, we had nothing to...(intervention).      Absolutely nothing, what the witness says in his statement, it’s a dece ased witness by the way Chair, he overheard a conversation by two other people stating that they wanted to get rid of Colonel Ntonko and they will speak to Booysen and Mostert about it but he says in the prosecution memorandum that it was Booysen and Moste rt who conspired to kill Ntonko.  Chair if he was right then they should have charged myself    The fact of the matter is an inquest findings Magistrates had a lready ruled that the number of the people that were being sought were – and eventually killed that they were responsible for the killing of Ntonko.  So that – it’s a complete fabrication.  When I pointed this out to them in my founding affidavit, in my review application for the second authorisation, he exacerbates his own problem, he says to me that’s his interpretation of what the witness says and, I mean Chair, we can read the     Ntonko.     They first said that they need to get rid of Ntonko...(intervention).      Yes Chair.     But Chair then in his answering affidavit he – this time around he lies under oath, he says that Booysen and Mostert received money from, I can’t rem ember, some(indistinct) association on three occasions.  There’s nothing like that in the docket, there’s nothing like that in the statement.    Chair he was speaking what was written in the Sunday Times, he was not, he was not confining himself to what was recorded in the dockets.       That’s so Chair.     And over and above that...(intervention).     No that would havebeen completely irrational.     Chair there’s another – I agree with you Chair, there’s another allegation in the prosecution memorandum that I planted a AK47 on one of the scenes.  That story was in the newspaper, there’s not even a hint of evidence in any of the dockets.     Chair it was initially my understanding that Mahema drafted the prosecution memorandum and Noko did the PowerPoint presentation.  When I addressed it in my review application the response from Mahema was that he did both which in my view exac erbates his problem because the prosecution memorandum and the PowerPoint presentation itself are at odds witheach other, I cannot see how it could have been done by the same person but if I give him the benefit of the doubt both contain falsehoods, misrepresentations and omissions.     That prosecution was then authorised by advocate Shaun Abrahams.      the second one   The first one was authorised by advocate Nomgcobo Jiba.     The same thing Chair.       Yes Chair.  Chair in my statement, I deal with a specific chapter if I can call it that...(intervention).      That’s the statement that’s before yourself Chair.  I deal specifically with a number of prosecutors which I firmly believe did things at the behest of certain     Advocate Mahema and advocate Noko were both part of that group.      Chair it’s not the onlytime that Mahema lied.     When the – advocate Jiba was – there was an investigation against her consequent to the Govern judgment she was charged with fraud and I think defeating the ends of justice and perjury.  Advocate Mahema made a statement in favour of advocate Jiba in that statement he also tells a blatant lie.  He says in that statement that a witness was killed. He knows full well the witness was never killed, the witness died of natural causes, he knows it because we brought that to his attention in my first review applicationagainst Jiba, yet much later in an affidavit in support of advocate Jiba he says the witness was killed.     Chair, no he just mentions in that statement that a witness was killed.  I think for the uninformed who would read that statement would come to the conclusion the person w as killed by Kato Manor although he does not say that in his statement.   That’s my position on that point Chair.       Chair as a matter of fact right – with the first review application, I think it was my supplementary affidavit we told him that this witness has died, he even denied that the witness was dead.  I sent someone to the Home Affairs to obtain a copy of his death certificate.  It’s clear from the death certificate that he died of natural causes.  I then, in a further affidavit, told him, here’s the death certificate clearly indicating the man died of natural cause but in supporting Jiba in a criminal investigation against her, he says a witness was killed  and he refers to that specific witness(indistinct).    I do not Chair.    Then her paragraph2.14   “The fact that Advocate Noko has failed to return the casedocket to the investigating officers and spite a request by him and the subsequen t timing of dismissal leaves me with this inescapable conclusion.”    Chair yes I did – my    I touched my head.    And then I – I was scared that they did not see me.  I actually started slapping myself on the head.    To make sure.    That they – that theysee the signal but over and above that Chair.     There is also the video recording.    Of him putting the money in my car.    Yes Chair.  As Chair is aware you have direct witness evidence.     That was contained inthe docket.  You have circumstantial evidence.    That was contained in the docket.    There was technical  Such as the fingerprints of Madhoe on one of the documents.   There was the evidence of Panday’s brother ’s girlfriend’s father.     Who they had taken to the bank to withdraw a substantial amount of money.   I think it was  That was found amongst the money.    There was the actual Act 70 interceptions.    There was also the tower movement.    There was also the SMS’ that he had sent me.    That was downloaded from my – from my phone and his phone.    And in spite of all that    She says there is no case.    Chair to me.    Chair to me it is incomprehensible that she can come to that conclusion of.     Over the years I have dealt with many cases.    And she herself – sheherself says that the Criminal Procedure Act.     Provides for a single - single witnesses evidence.    But here it is not a single witness.  She says it is his word against mine.  There are people who actually saw that.  There is a 252A.     From the DPPs Office. There is the coordinator.  There is the investigator.  It is just overwhelming Chair.  There is just no ways that anyone could come to a rational conclusion that there is no case against Panday and Madhoe.     Yes Chair.    Chair not once.    From my arrest had Iever been given an opportunity.    In terms of a warning statement or in terms of a response.     Not once.    Never ever Chair not  Chair I think I testified about that earlier on.  That is when subsequent to this letter of mine where Advocate – because this was addressed to Advocate Nxasana.    No Chair I think she is referring to General Moodley.    General Moodley was in charge of Crime Intelligence in the Province.   Which is Colonel Padayachee reported to General Moodley.    There was at that stage.    Panday allegedly wascalled in by – by Moodley.    And played some of the intercepts.    I am not aware of that.    I do not think that took place because when it was reported in the media at the time.     Panday quoted thingsthat was definitely not said during the Act 70 interceptions.     Which he said he had heard.    So I have got my – I have got my reservations whether Moodley actually did that or not.     I do not think it    And I think she is referring to.    To General Moodley.CHAIRPERSON   Yes Chair yes.    Yes Chair.    Advocate Noko was the – the Senior Prosecutor in the Province (intervenes).     Yes Chair.    Chair my response istwofold.  One is I agree with Chair.  That is – that is a normal course that we always follow when – when there are representations from accused persons but what concerns me most about this memorandum of hers.  It is almost an attack against me.    And the case.  It makes me look like the accused person.   And the actual    The tone of her whole letter.    I would have at least expected - as Chair says – to have at least been given – given me an opportunity.    To state my case.    I do not know Chair.CHAIRPERSON   That is right Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I think there was a memorandum Chair but not a PowerPoint presentation.     That is so Chair.    Chair if you would allow me I just want to.    Contextualise the date on this report.    This is not soon after Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa was moved sideways.    And this coincides    During this period.  I was still busy supervising the Panday investigation.   And the Amigos investigation.    Both which Nokosubsequently withdrew.    And then recommend my – recommended my prosecution.    Thank you Chair.    No Chair it is in my evidence.    Is at the exact same time.    It was after Mlotshwa refused to withdraw against.    The people in the    He refused to sign our indictment – mine and Cato Manor ’s indictment.    He gets replaced.    Noko withdraws those charges.    Against the Amigosgroupings.    And also Panday and Madhoe.    Chair all I can – theresponse I can give is what she says in the letter.    She refers to the application.    In terms of Section 2(4) of POCA.  The proposed    And then the draft authorisations.    And then she says “…and recommend the application.”     No Chair.    I do not know Chairbut.    I will venture a guess that they were not there.    That is correct Chair.     That is so Chair.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER    That is so Chair.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER    No it was related to the first authorisation Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     That’s correct Chair.     I suspect so Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Chair it had becomeclear after advocate Mamabolo and advocate Kruger who was in ch arge of the desk to go through the documents before it’s eventually given to the NDPP.  When they removed advocate Anthony Mosing then took over their position.  I later on refer – when I talk about advocate Mosing under the heading of prosecutors Chair bu t at this point what I would like to mention is that on the 8 t h of March 2012 that was barely two and a half months into the investigation after the Sunday Times report, I’m in possession of a copy of handwritten notes which advocate Mosing kept minutes of the meeting which it’s – where it indicates that there was a meeting between himself, members from IPID, ICD then,the Minister of Police who was Minister Nathi Mthethwa at the time and also the then acting National Commissioner which would have been General Mkhwanazi, he wrote (indistinct) though it’s actually Mkhwanazi.  Now from those notes Chairs...(intervention).    Is that the typed version?       What page is it?     That’s indeed thecopy chair.     Chair this copy is notvery – it’s not a very good copy the one that I – the actual one is clearer than this.     In the typed version    Okay Chair.        Chair I’m reading from the typed version.     The meeting was – itsays 8/3/12 meeting with the ICD the n there are three named, Gamanyana, Glen Angus and Mr Khuba, then it reads, “first meeting, meeting with Minister of Police SAPS – acting National Commissioner Nkankla Vilikazi, I think he recorded that wrong because it’s Nkonazi and then it reads on, mer ge two teams.  Mandate– matter pending since December 2011 – hit squad allegations – on the typed version, Chair I’ve – those bold letters are my own bold letters it’s what I read from the minutes but I made them bold myself, they’re not bold in the ...(intervention).     That’s right so it says,“wants arrest by this week worked throughout weekend and then the other one the underlining is also by myself Chair and the  boldness and that – in this particular line Chair coincides with whatemanated during the – Judge Makoro’s Commission of Enquiry or the Enquiry not the Commission of Enquiry.  Challenged to rope in NPA prosecutors – not submit to KZN DPP but to NDPP and t hen it reads on General Mabula met with Malotshwa promise – then I cannot figure out what’s written there and then only – join only next week.  It mentions 51 cases, those J56 (19) inquest dockets, 12 and then I couldn’t make out what he wrote. Now 6 cased  that are needing other investigation outstanding, I wrote verbatim Chair – brought 6 cases which they want to bring here and fields I cannot make out what he wrote, wants decision by tomorrow.  Suspects 12 in unit – Booysen PCOC, that PCwould be at the Provincial Commissioners office at organised crime unit office.  Evidence of photos which General Mabula – with General Mabula’s team need to get.  Way forward whether and prosecutor – will join next week.  ICD offices Durban briefed NDPP”. The things that are highlighted Chair is – it says first meetingwith the Minister of Police SAPS and the acting National Commissioner of Police and it says, merged two teams, mandate matter pending since December 2011, hit squad allegations.  Wants arrest by this week, work throughout weekend.  Now Chair my interpretation of that is if you are there with the Minister, my interpretation of this is that was one of his demands and then very importantly Chair, challenge to rope in the NPA prosecutors, not submit to KZN DPP b ut to submit to NDPP.     That’s correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON    Chair I might add that subsequent to the Sunday Times ap ologising to myself I had a radio interview with Carima Brown from 702 channel where some of these issues were discussed and when I left the studio, when I arrived home I received a text message from Carima Brown from 702 that MinisterMthethwa had issued a media release again saying what I had said during the interview.  The following morning she phoned me and she said to me that she’s inviting the Minister to the studio to discuss these issues, would I be prepared to come back to the studio and I said to her, you can tell the Minister I’ll meet him in the studio tonight and shesaid would you come and I said I would. I arrived there at the studio that same evening he didn’t arrive so they dialled him in and during this conversation Carima Brown indicated t o the Minister that I’m in possession of these minutes.  He was, in the beginning a bit cagey about the meeting, that he hadn’t seen the minutes but then she asked him a very pertinent question whether he had a meeting with the prosecutors which he confirmed on national radio or 702.  She pointed out to him that he had no business meeting with prosecutors which I agree with.  He tried to justify his involvement by saying that there were allegations of human rights abuses and he referred to oneparticular case where a person by the name of Mkhize got shot and killed.  I expected him to use that example so I took documents with me to the studio which I gave to Carima Brown because the Mkhize family had sued the Minister of Police, Minister Nathi Mathetwa at th e time, for the unlawful killing of Mr Mkhize but the Minister at the time, Mr Nathi Mathetwa deposed to an affidavit in a civil matter saying that the shooting by Kato Manor was justifiable and it was lawful and reasonable and he was at pains to explain, on the one hand he says...(intervention).     That’s why I got involved but we also pointed out to him then th at he’s taking up a different position that he had taken up in the Marikana matter where he testified saying that his understanding of the role of the Minister is todeal with matters of policy and we pointed out to him – and that’s my understanding as well Chair but we pointed out to him that there was a discrepancy in how he approached these two matters.  In the Kato Manor case he sought to get involved in operational matters.  He obviously denied that he had gotten involved in the operational matters but my interpretation of the minutes is that he had met with prosecutors and demanded that we be arrested and that was as early as 8 t h of March 2012 barely before any statements had been taken Chair.      Indeed Chair.     I think it was Minister     2012, no it wasn’t Minister Masutha, wasn’t it...(intervention).      Gadebe that’s right Chair.     Chair it’s a letter written by advocate, I think it was, Mahema at the time, it’s addressedto IPID, Mr Angus and to the person who was leading the Kato Manor investigation General Mabula and it’s from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, South Gauteng.      That’s what I’m     Chair on the original – not the original, the copy that I have I think advocate Chauke signed the letter but if Chair would look at the top it says with enquiries, G S Mahema, that’s advocate Mahema so if they followed the sameprocedure that we do in SAPS the person drafts the letter, his name is in the top left under enquiries and it’s signed off by the head of the office.     If my memory serves me correctly it was advocate Chauke Chair.     Well Chair my – the only inference that I can draw given the history of Minister Mtetwa’s involvement his officers involvement the only inference that I can come to that it – he was referring to the Minister Mtetwa.  That does notnecessarily implicate Minister Mtetwa but the question that I would pose is why would Chauke have the liberty to say well he wants to take it up with the Minister?     I would call them the corruption busters.    Chair in this – in this paragraph I make the assertion that these prosecutors that I am mentioning in my statement acted at the behest of Advocate  Jiba.    Who was doing the bidding of the then State President Mr  Jacob Zuma and also    When I consulted with Advocate September yesterday she said to me it is a wild statement to make.    And I have to at least substantiate that.    And Chair I would like    To do it in the following way.    I just mention a fewthings.  Over and above what transpired and evolved over the last couple of years the inescapable conclusion – that is the inescapable conclusion that I come to - but I would like just to point out a few things.    When Advocate Jiba arrested – was part of the team who arrested Advocate  Gerrie Nel during this Jackie Selebi trial.    Subsequent.CHAIRPERSON   No, I think she – between.    Yes.  Ja well rather not coincidentally the same General  Mabula who arrested Gerrie Nel also arrested me.    In conjunction withJiba.    After Gerrie Nel – the case against Gerrie Nel was withdrawn Jiba was suspended for her role    After Gerrie Nel – the case against Gerrie Nel was withdrawn.    Advocate Jiba was suspended.    For her role in the arrest of Gerrie Nel.    And strangely the person who came to her aid there and who deposed to a statement in her favour was Richard Mdluli.    I do not know theexact extent of the statement Chair.     Where it was just a confirmatory or whether it was.    The statement was in favour of – of.    Of Jiba.    Supporting.    The second thing Chair I would like to point out is on 8  September 2010 the husband of Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba – Sikhumbuzo Booker Nhantsi – whom I believe was an attorney.    He had been charged for theft of trust money.  But on  The – the then President Mr Jacob Zuma.  Expunged his conviction.    And the third point I want to make Chair to validate my paragraph of 89.     In November 2011.    In which he says   At the time.“In the event that I come back to work I will assist the President to succeed next year.”     2011 Chair.    No Chair.    No.    I know about it and this was widely reported in the media at the time Chair.     I think this was justbefore the Polokwane ANC Conference Chair.  I am not too sure.    I think it was that one Chair.  So Chair having regard to what the evidence leader told me – it is a wild statement to make.    Those are highlights    Connections that I draw.    But there are also other events that makes.    That causes me to come to that conclusion.    Of the – of a decade.    For one she frustrated lobby groups to have the criminal charges against the Previous President Mr Jacob Zuma.    They were eventually    Where they – where they were compelled to release it.     She also paid.    She frustrated.    That is – that is correct Chair.    Chair as you would    The Spy Tapes were central to the withdrawal of criminal charges against the.     The previous StatePresident.    Chair Advocate Jiba was also involved – and it has come out now in Judge Mokgoro’s inquiry.    With the withdrawal of charges against Richard Mdluli.    She was also involvedwith.    She was also involved with – well Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach who insisted on prosecuting Jiba was then suspended – Breytenbach insisted on prosecuting Mdluli.   She was then suspended by – by Advocate Jiba.    She was found notguilty in that disciplinary hearing after her suspension.   That was now Breytenbach.    Chair I cannot recall what they suspended her for.    But it is my view and it is borne out by a number of.    For instance the -this.    Inquiry.  That - it was Advocate Breytenbach’s instance on prosecuting Mdluli that eventually led her to be suspended.    Yes.    Yes Chair.  Chair once Breytenbach was acquitted that still did not deter then Mr – Advocate Shaun Abrahams.    And the person who    Who prosecuted her on these spurious charges.    Chair this – the same Raymond Mathenjwa – Advocate Mathenjwa I mention it later on and I find it strange that when Advocate Abrahams reauthorised my prosecution on the Monday he appeared in the – in the court here somewhere in Johannesburg.    And that very same Friday he is in Durban.    That is right Chair.      Chair obviously through the nature of the work that I do and having known a number of prosecutors I engaged with them and I spoke to a number of them.    And the feedback that I would get from the prosecutors was that the National Prosecuting Office in Pretoria was like a battle ground.     There were – therewere two factions.    Those who wanted to prosecute.    Independently without fear or favour.    And then there – there was what – and I have written a couple of articles about which I wouldrefer to – to the cabal.  When Advocate Nxasana was appointed.    And to that extent he invited a retired Constitutional Court Judge Mr  Jakob – Justice Jakob – to try and establish what was going on at the NPA.     And it emerged duringhis attempt – during that inquiry that both Mrwebi and Jiba had been extremely recalcitrant.    To the extent that I think in the end he recommended a Judicial Commissioner of Inquiry.     Chair a number of disparaging remarks had been made against Advocate  Jiba.  I think all that came out in the Justice  Mokgoro Inquiry.    Chair then I conclude the section with Advocate  Jiba that she had been suspended. Thatthere was the inquiry but the events have overtaken my testimony.     So we now know that the state     The State President.    Has – has dismissed her.  When I met Advocate Maema the first time.    And in the beginning I thought – my view of him was that he is a wise old man.     But it emerged later to me that he either was not wise or he had been – been captured.    Because invariably heseems to be and I describe him as the “go for person”.     Whenever there is a problem with certain prosecutions and I highlight some of those prosecutions.    I have referred earlier on Chair to the statement that he made in the criminal investigation    Under oath to say a witness had been killed.    Chair I have already covered paragraph 101 with regards to the fabrications in the prosecution memorandum by Advocate  Maema.    To prosecute myself    Well the fabrications, the omissions and the misrepresentations.  I am also aware that Mr Johan Van Loggenberg one of the accused in the so called SARS    Had also logged a complaint against Advocate  Maema.  According to the advocate for Van Loggenberg he also lied under oath in an application which Mr Van Loggenberg had brought in the Gauteng High Court.   According toMr Johan Van Loggenberg from SARS who has also been prosecu ted – he filed a complaint with Advocate Abrahams against Advocate  Maema and Advocate Mzinyathi in which he accuses – that is where Van Loggenberg accused Maema also of lying under oath.   I have not independently verified that Chair.    And then Chair he also gets involved with the so called Rendition case againstMr McBride.  For apparently updating the report.  Now Chair that case went to court and eventually    Well Chair I have already given evidence that in my absence of two years that the Panday    With regards to the SARS investigations – Chair what happened is I was oblivious to the investigation SARS was busy with.  I was invited to the Nelson Mandela Foundation by a journalist to attend to a meeting and when I asked her what the meeting was about she sent me a text message and the invitation basically rea d only if you are invited you can come to this meeting.  So I said to her well I am not invited.  She said no but you are one of the subjects of discussion and I said I would get you there.     And as I walk in I saw Mr McBride there.  So I thought at least there is someone who I know here.    In Sandton.    From a journalist.    Yes.    And Chair when Iwalked in we all recognised each other.     But we have never met before.  We recognised each other from – from media articles and photographs.    Johan Van Loggenberg, Ivan Pillay.  All the usualsuspects.    Were all there.    And then we – it wasthe University of the Witwatersrand conjunction with various other universities.  They were doing an investigation into state capture.   And there is a Professor – I think Lipkin or something.  He was leading the discussion.   But during the discussion each one of us had to give – make a small presentation.    Where we fit into this.CHAIRPERSON   Into this story and then after that we decided amongst ourselves to have a separate meeting.    And then to bring all our notes with us.    And it is at that point where as myself, Van Loggenberg, Pillay and company were talking andGeneral Dramat also eventually joined us in the meeting.     He did not attend the first one and he sent his brother.     That we were also investigating.    And that is why I always maintain that the three – the Cato Manor story, the Cato ManorDeath Squad story, the SARS Rogue story and the so called Rendition story.  Yes Chair.He publically took responsibility in the media for changing the prosecutors. At the time which was I think Gerrie  Nel and Andrea Johnson who is still with the National Prosecuting Authority and not surprisingly Mr Kebble was eventually acquitted.    He was also involvedwith the charges against Mr  (indistinct) who was a senior police officer who was charged for defeating the ends of justice after he allegedly interfered with the witness Mr Agliotti.  I understand that matter did not proceed either.    And then I conclude    And in the process – in litigation he has perjured himself on more than one occasion.  I have opened criminal cases against him and he is – he actively attempted to defend Advocate Jiba.    That is right Chair.    Chair I just want to add one thing about Maema.  It is my understanding that none of these prosecutors including him – I see Justice Mokgoro addresses that.    And Maema was one of them.  Chair Advocate Anthony Mosing – his name started to feature with the  At the time the investigating officer - Colonel Piet Du Plooy – with forensic auditor – I think it was Mr Trevor White.  I cannot recall was summoned to the office by – by Advocate Mosing and there they indicated to – toDu Plooy that the case is not very strong and I recall Du  Plooy at the time reported to me that they were summoned to Pretoria and it was clear to them that they already had made up their mind.  He said to me at the time at the conclusion of the meeting he basically said them he does not see the need for this meeting because it looks like they – they are not going to proceed in any event.     So I think that is where the stage was set.    By Advocate Noko.    In KZN.  In my view at Advocate Noko was appointed and at least one of the points has beenconfirmed by Justice Mokgoro to – well Advocate Mlotshwa was removed and replaced by Advocate Noko to do what Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa refused to do and that is to.     Sanction.    The application for – for racketeering charges against myself and Cato Manor.     Hm.ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER   She withdrew the – Advocate Noko withdrew the charges against Toshan  Panday and Navin Madhoe.  Chair myunderstanding is that those appointments are done by the State President but the State Pres ident would not just out of the blue appoint a person.    They must – I suspectit.    Came as – after a recommendation by Advocate  Jiba.    Chair the three main points I am making with regards to Advocate  Noko.    She was put there as a proxy.    She had to withdrawthe charges against Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.     Which she eventually did.    And then she also did what Simphiwe Mlotshwa refused to do.  And that is to     It would have been Advocate Jiba because Advocate Jiba is the one who wanted Advocate Mlotshwa to sign our – my prosecution.     That’s right Chair.    And then a year laterAdvocate Noko was appointed permanently as the DPP by the State President.     And then I’ve already testified with regards to Noko’s role with Advocate Mahema in themisrepresentations and the falsehoods and the prosecu tion memorandum and the Powerpoint presentation to have us prosecuted.      That’s correct Chair.  I’ve detailed those in my affidavit which is attached to my statement.      Chair in the recent interviews that were televised when the – for the appointment of a new     And one of the panellists asked her about the Booysen matter and her response was that she had found it on the court roll when she got there, almost absolving herself of any involvement and when I watched it I said to myself how can a person who knows this is being broadcast nationally sit and lie to a panel like that.  She had signed both the covering letters for my and Cato Manor’s prosecution so she – I think she misled the panel there by saying to the panel she found the thing there on the     Chair the objective is that she signed both those covering letters and then she tells the panelshe found the thing there when she ...(intervention)      Yes Chair.    I think the words she used Chair is she found it on the court roll.     Yes Chair.      That’s correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON  That was my interpretation of what she was saying, that she did not want to go therebecause I think that possibly would have led to other questions.      Chair with regards to Advocate Torie Pretorius I described him as a lightning conductor in my statement.  We have these prosecutors like Mahema and Noko and Mosing and a few others that are in the coalface in the courts but in thebackground you have Advocate Torie Pretorius giving legal opinions and invariably those opinions are against the likes of myself, Pravin Gordhan etcetera.  Both him and and Advocate Mussenj ate and I think that is Advocate Abrahams as well, well it was Advocate Pretorius, Mussenjate and Abrahams they received notices of intention to suspend them by the then President for their role in the aborted Minister Pravin Gordhan matter.  They were eventually not suspended but I think it will be interesting to know what is written in their presentations because that might indicate where the decision to prosecute Mr Pravin Gordhan were politically motivated or not, but be that as it may Chair the factthat Mr Torie Pretorius had involved himself in aligning with the prosecution of Mr Pravin Gordhan and we now know which had catastrophic effects on the economy of the country and as I previously alluded to the fact that the PCLU of which he is a member thes e investigations do not fall into the remit of the PCLU, but he constantly seems to get himself involved or either by default or by design and he also gave a legal opinion in the Cato Manor matter when we brought an application to have the matter struck off the roll, when he aligned himself with the prosecutors, Mahema at the time.     Chair Advocate Raymond Matenjwa was the initial prosecutor when the first batch ofCato Manor members were arrested.  I wasn’t present at court, I had a commitment with members from the FBI in the USA, in KZN but on various occasions he opposed bail, on various occasions he had to be called to order by the magistrate for his antis in court.  He’s involved in my investigation, like I said earlier on he was also involved in one week going to court for Glynnis Breytenbach an d during the same week a different province for my matter.  I have been told by two very senior advocates from the National Prosecuting Authority that there was a letter where a number of prosecutors had been promised promotion by Advocate Abrahams, I never saw this letter, but two independentAdvocates told me about this and Advocate Raymond Matenjwa was one of them that was going to be a promoted to a post at Nelspruit where a new post was to be created.  My understanding from these two senior advocates  from the National Prosecuting Authority is that Advocate Abrahams had already drafted the papers, but it was at that time when the then State President was under pressure and he resigned, so he had not signed off on that, which eventually negated the prom otion of these prosecutors of which Matenjwa was one.     Chair the people that were mentioned the majority of the people that were going to bepromoted are some of the prosecutors that I deal with in my statement.     Chair the one might not, the other one might.     I will Chair.CHAIRPERSON    Chair it’s common cause that he was appointed by the State President.      That was Advocate   Chair obviously     Chair I don’t think he had a specific view but he facilitated after I deleted my letter to him he facilitated prosecutors to re-evaluate so in my view those were one of his sins that he was prepared to have all those cases that had become dormant to make them alive again.       The second sin Ithink he committed was it was under his stewardship that Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba was prosecuted.     And that’s borne out Chair by and I refer to that in paragraph 127 of my statement, I was watching the evidence of Advocate Mohofe where Advocate Mohofe stated ...(intervention)      That’s correct Chair.  Where he stated that the then Minister of Police, Minister Nathi Nhlekoinformed him that there is going to be an audience with the State President, which eventually happened, and during this conversation in spite of the fact that he had no relevant experience as a prosecutor , never mind to head the National Prosecuting Authority, that the President wanted him to become the new NDPP, that was whileAdvocate Nkosana was the NDPP and what struck me of his evidence Chair and that convinced me more than anything else that one of t he cardinal sins that I also committed was to be the complainant in a matter against Advocate Jiba.  According to Advocate Mohofe the State President was not happy with the fact that she had been prosecuted and in fact he offered him to become the NDPP and  I think the words that he used is that he would be the (indistinct) NDPP but Jiba was going to be the default.     I think he used the word default ja, default DPP as long as Jiba was left alone.  Chair with regards to Advocate Abrahams when he assumed office two of the very first things he did was to call Advocates Ferreira and Van Eeden because they were the prosecutors appointed by Advocate Nxasana to prosecutor Advocate Jiba, and he wanted an opinion from them as to the strength of the case.  And I am aware of this Chair because those documents were attached to another application, I think it was in the Western Cape.  He procured that from the two Advocates himself and on a reading of that Chair it’s blatantly evident from their opinions thatthere is a case to be answered by Advocate Jiba. The other thing that he did was to ask Advocate Gerrie Nel about the Panday matters.  That was in 2015 Chair and my understanding is that Advocate Gerrie Nel had made certain recommendations that a number of people in those investigations areprosecuted. So that was the very first thing he did and we now know what’s happened to those investigations, none of those people to date have appeared in front of a Court and with regards to the – it’s the first one I was mentioning, with regards to the Jiba matter that eventually Chair the trial was supposed to commence I think it was on a Wednesday, and I was consulting with the Prosecutor the week before that and we had to work from his files because the Prosecutor told me the docket was with Advocate Mogatle, Marshall Mogatle I think his name is.  What later emerged was that Ferreira had written an email to Mogatle to tellhim listen I need my docket, I’m cons ulting with a witness, the trial is about to commence and Mogatle’s response to that was in an email that the docket is with the NDPP, obviously Mr Abrahams, and that they should have an answer by the following day, which makes me think that because subsequent to the withdrawal of charges against Jiba they announced that the charges were withdrawn by Advocate Mogatle, but I firmly believe that they were actually withdrawn by Advocate Sean Abrahams and that was confirmed in an application to the High Court, I cannot recall whether it was Freedom under the Law or whether that was the Helen Suzman Foundation, there the judges all held, I think itwas a full bench Chair, all the judges held there that in spite of the fact that Mogatle and Mahema deposed deposed to affidavits under oath that it was Mogatle that withdrew the charges and not Abrahams.  The Court found that it was indeed Abrahams who withdrew the charges and   And Chair not surprisingly you have a High Court finding against Advocate Abrahams and the judges even in their judgment says it raises questions about integrity, and they also make other adverse remarks against Advocate Abrahams and Advocate Mogatle and I just find it curious  that up until today, in spite of those negative aspersions cast by High Court Judges absolutely nothing has happened to Advocate Mogatle and Advocate Abrahams, neither from the employer at the time who was the NPA and neither from – well the then GCB and I believe that there’s a new bodynow.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.   Ja, there wasmajority and a descending judgment but all the judges held that or found that it was in fact Abrahams who withdrew the charges and not Mogatle.     In spite of the fact that both deposed to affidavits in opposing the application.      Chair obviously whathappened with ...(intervention)      No Chair, sorry Chair, the Court held that the withdrawal of charges by Abrahams was irrational.     And to my mind the     But to date none of that has happened.  I found out through the Justice Mokgoro inquiry when they were pushed for an answer Jiba’s counsel then said to Judge Mokgoro they’re going to establish what happened and then thefollowing day they handed in a letter from an – I think he’s from, Advocate Smit, I can’t remember which Province he was from, Northwest, which he said that so obviously Advocate Abrahams had referred it to another Advocate again who then said no there’s no reasonable chance of success for prosecution.       In my view he did not have the authority to review what the two other Advocates had already established.     Chair I was the complainant.       Chair my view if – when I took early retirement, five months early, not that I am retired Chair, I am still working, Chair in my view an d that’s how I feel about it, if I just kept my mouth shut and either taken the golden handshake byGeneral Phiyega and disappeared into the sunset they would have forgotten about Johan Booysen.  The fact that I went back and reopened all these cases and Advocate Jiba was not prosecuted I am convinced that that prompted the reaction that I eventually experienced, that I was now re-prosecuted by Advocate Sean Abrahams.  Chair all the evidence, or should I say the lack of evidence had been ventilated in fro nt of Judge Gorvan and he is very emphatic in his findings.  My assertions that the witnesses that they referred to, Aiyer, Dannicas, Londlo, every single one that Abrahams now purportsto rely upon the Judge there held over and above the fact that some of  those statements weren’t even signed but even if they were, does not link me to the offences I am being prosecuted for, yet Mr Sean Abrahams uses the same statements with the addition of one, the statement of the Greek citizen in the Jiba application was never signed,and even if it was signed Judge Gorvan said it does not implicate me in the commission of an offence.  Advocate Abrahams when I applied to have his authorisation to prosecute me reviewed and set aside in his answering affidavit he states that he had sent Advocate Mahema and Advocate Dawood Adams to Greece and they had now taken a signed statement of Dannicas, and he says the statement is now signed, I was satisfied and then he authorised my prosecution.Chair the problem with that is when I heard, when I saw that I said to my attorney please phone Advocate Mahema and ask him for acopy of the signed statement.     Yes Chair.  Which Mr van der Merwe duly did and I was present when he phoned him and Advocate Mahema’s response was the statement is still in Greek it’s not been translated yet.       Still in Greek Chair.   It hasn’t beentranslated yet.  Chair as I sit here today in spite of a number of letters to Advocate Mahema I still do not have a copy of a signed statement, I understand that it eventually was translated but that’s probably almost a year after Advocate Abrahams re-authorised my prosecution which begged the question how could he have considered a statement whichis in Greek, unless he is conversant in Greek which I don’t think he is..      Chair most of this what they do to me is Greek, but I don’t think he is conversant in Greek.     Chair I have actually challenged him in my answering, in my rep lying affidavit to which I have not received a response yet.   That review     That’s pending Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  From 96 to 143 it is a consolidationof all the evidence in relation to the Booysen matter.     To the extent that it consolidates the evidence.  There are parts of Booysen’s evidence which is  included at different intervals.    There is also a dedicated section.     Which is at the page Chair directed us to which is page 106.   And that is specifically to his version.     So my understanding is that when General Booysen considered these paragraphs – and I am happy for him to confirm this to.    He agrees that where any evidence that he placed before the enquiry.     In the bigger context of the evidence as consolidated.    Recorded.    Yes Chair.    As it.    In that instance can we then start off at page 96?  It is correct that the purpose of the evidenc e in relation to the or rather paragraph 94 records that this particular section which deals with your matter hones in on new aspects of the Booysen matter.  If I may refer to it as such and deals with the issue of racketeering authorisations.  The purpose  of evidence is not to evaluate ordetermine the guilt or innocence of Booysen in relation to the criminal charges you are currently facing but rather to consider with reference to the terms of reference vis-à-vis the lawfulness of the decision taken by Jiba to authorise the prosecution of Booysen for racketeering?     If we could then look at page 97.    At page 97 paragraph 296 it is recorded that the evidence before the inquiry.     Thank you.    Thank you.  EXHIBIT ZG page 97    From page 98 of the same exhibit at Clause 5.2.1.2 the powers of the DPP to prosecute outside of their jurisdiction is addressed in particular from paragraphs 297 to paragraph 303 on page 102.    Correct Chair.CHAIRPERSON   Yes Chair.    Yes.   My submission is that the recordal in relation to the considerations of the DPP to prosecute outside of their jurisdiction which General Booysen need not comment on is dealt with in paragraphs 297.    To 303.    The offence – we are now on page 2 – which deals specifically with the offence of racketeering and thejudgment of Gorven J, okay and so to just for the record the offence of racketeering is dealt with only in two paragraphs which is 3 04 and 305.  When one then looks to page 103 if I can take you to Clause 5.2.1.4 it talks about the process of evaluation of racketeering charges within the NPA.    It is the – it appears to be a sub section – a sub section.  Just above paragraph 306.     General Booysen you have givenevidence that you have extensive knowledge in relation to racketeering and process.  Is that correct?    Do you have any comments in relation to the process of evaluating racketeering charges within theNPA based on your experience in the service?     And that is in fact confirmed on page 5 paragraph 320 which reads that the process which is preceded in paragraphs 313 to 319 was not followed in the Booysen ma tter and no explanation has been provide as to why the accepted process was not followed.    Thank you Chair.  If we can then turn to page 106 and at sub paragraph 5.2.1.5 which is titled “Booysen’sVersion” that is in fact the version that you tendered before the inquiry.  Is that so?    Okay and in particular at page – same page of 106 paragraph 232 - sorry 323 – the last line reads that   325 first sentence says   On what basis do you draw the conclusion that it was no t a coincidence?    Thank you Chair.  So just to confirm the conclusion of coincidence that you draw is your conclusion?     To continue on page 107 of EXHIBIT ZG paragraph 328 it is recorded that   To then quickly deal with yoursuspensions.  When were you first suspended General  Booysen?    Thank you Chair.  What then happened during September  2012?     Thank you.  General Booysen what then happened during September of 2012?      During September of 2012.    And did that suspension result in adisciplinary hearing being convened?      And who chaired that disciplinary hearing?     To that end can I then take you to bundle ZB?  That’s page 442, or rather 443, sorry.  This document ismarked as findings.  If I can ask you to then turn to page 470, is it     While we are dealing with this particular finding I ask you to turn to page 44, sorry paragraph 44     So Advocate Naseer Cassiem’s findings which is dated the 16 t h of September 2014 is released, do youreturn to work?     Thank you Chair.    So.    So Major-General Berning Ntlemeza was in office and were any steps then taken?     On that particular point if I can take you Bundle ZG which is the Mokgoro Report at page 108.  Under sub paragraph 5.2.1.7 which is titled “Monetary Reward” it is dealt with from paragraphs 331 to 337 on the next page.  Is that the monetary reward that you were referring to?     Thank you Chair.  If I can ask you to turn to Bundle ZB and in particular page 315?  Is this the Van  Zyl –Justice Van Zyl judgment that you refer to which at page 345 sets aside your suspension and ordered that pending the outcome of any disciplinary proceedings you will be not liable to suspension from your employment in addition to which a punitive costs order was granted?     Thank you.    No but we can certainly.    Thank you Chair.  It is correct thatthe – the suspension did result in not only being set aside by court but additional legal action was taken?     Is that the suspension which led to a hearing the evidence of which shall not be placed before the    Thank you Chair.    In that instance can we go back to the EXHIBIT ZG – the Mokgoro Report at page 109 and just to add Chair in the introduction – in the initial presentation to the stream there was a slide that was posted which informed that Major-General Berning Ntlemeza acted during the dates of 2014 to 15 following which he was appointed to the position of National Head of DPCI from 2015 to 2017.    Page 109 which is sub paragraph 5.2.1.8 and titled “Padayachee Affidavit”.  Without going into the detail of what is stated from paragraphs 338 to 345 is it correct that this particular Colonel Brian Padayachee is the same Padayachee whoassisted you in the Toshan Panday investigation relating to interception (background noise)?    Can we then move on to page 111 of  the report?  Under paragraph 5.2.1.9 it is marked “The Decision to Authorise the Prosecution and the Steps Taken”.  This particular section is dealt with at length and to that end you were asked General Booysen to please clarify the – as far as you are aw are – the process and involvement of Mlotshwa as the Acting DPP to authorisethe prosecution and the steps taken by augmenting what is already stated here.        So Mlotshwa refuses to sign without the supporting documentation.  Who in fact signed the indictment?  Are you aware?    And.    ZG.    There is - there is certainly the exchange between Mlotshwa at page 155.  Mlotshwa actually testified at the inquiry and that talks to his agreement to in fact sign theindictment without the supporting documents and Jiba’s non-interference in the exchange between him and Chauke.  Is that what you refer to Chair?    Can I perhaps have a look at that?     And revert to you?  I do not have it at.    At my fingertips right now.    If I can then take you to page 117 of the report – Mokgoro Report and that is sub paragraph 5.2.1.10 and that in fact confirms evidence that - unless I am incorrect – evidence inrelation to Mlotshwa’s end of office.  Do you have any comments in this regard?  No problem.Page 117 sub paragraph 5.2.1.10 is titled “No Reappointment of Mlotshwa”.  Do you have any personal knowledge in relation to that no reappointment?      Thank you on that score and specificto the prosecution memorandum in the outline of the procedure that needs to be followed for the purposes of obtaining the authorisations relating to racketeering charges, a prosecution memorandum needs to be submitted.  If one looks then from paragraph 375 at page 121 of th e Mokgoro report an address is made in relation to the prosecution memorandum specific to your case. Do you have any comments in relation to the prosecution memorandum submitted?      No problem Chair.  If I could ask you – just bear with me Chair.  If I could ask you to turn to page ZA.      Page 204 do you recognise this document?     Please explain what this document is?     So the document that appears from page 204 until page 260 of Exhibit ZA is that the prosecution memorandum relevant to the charge, the racketeering case against you?     Yes.MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN    And if I can then take you to page 261 of that same bundle there’s another document which appears there which runs until page...(intervention).      261 of the same bundle.     ZA still on ZA.      ZA.     No problem it’s page 204.     And if one goes to page 261 of that same bundle there’s a presentation document that appears there.  What document would this be?      Unfortunately I don’t...(intervention).CHAIRPERSON    It certainly doesn’t come to mind and I do not recall it to be included in the bundle.      Will do.     If we could then deal with these  documents since we’re at them which is the prosecution memorandum and the presentation.  Is it correct that you took certain action in relation to the detail of these documents and please explain the contextof such action that was then taken, if I can th en refer you to...(intervention).     So it was General Booysen’sevidence that in the process of obtaining the necessary authorisations there are two documents that need to be submitted.    The one is a prosecution memorandum.     And the other is – which is the one that appears at page 204.     And the other is a presentation thatneeds to be done at page 261.     Both of these documents, if I understand the evidence correctly, are documents that were then submitted in support of the institution of racketeering charges.     It’s Annexure JWB17.      Still the same bundle it’s ZA.     Page 191 there’s an affidavit which appears there which is your affidavit.      And similarly at page 199 of the same bundle appears another affidavit that you deposed to.      However these affidavits are in fact unsigned.     Page 199.     These affidavits talk to the prosecution memorandum and it talks to the presentation which is enclosed below.  Please explain the context of ...(intervention).      Thank you Chair. General Booysen please explain why you deposed to these affidavits and the context in which it was done?     So who drafted the prosecution memorandum?    And who authorised your prosecution?     That was the second.   Now General Booysen...(intervention).      So just to make sure I too understand, you’re saying that the same p rosecution memorandum together with the same presentation is what informed both authorisations?     Okay now General Booysen, why would advocate Noko and advocate Mahema include falseh oods indocuments that they are – that they compiled for presentation in such a serious proceeding?   Then – if you could then...(intervention).     Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair.  Following the submission of your letter was there any – did the – did the decision change at all?    Yes.    Thank you Chair.  If we can then move on to the next point that Chair had raised for attention and that is the letter – the covering letter specifically by Advocate  Noko.  With your leave if I may hand up two documents.   Yes.Before you Chair General Booysen had provided two documents.  The first documen t which is marked blue – which is a blue document.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Chair this is but just the covering letter and it does not include the annexures that are referred to in this letter.  In addition to this document General  Booysen had also provided another letter.    So if I may EXHIBIT Z(J) as has been    The next document which was also provided and yet to be marked relates to the second authorisation for racketeering charges.  Chair will recall that the first authorisation was done by Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba.    And the second was by – the second authorisation was by Advocate Shaun Abrahams.    With your permission are we to markthe next document?    If I may?    General Booysen if we could first quickly refer to EXHIBIT Z(J) - that is the blue document.  That is the covering letter that was sent by Advocate  Noko to Advocate Jiba in relation to the first authorisation of racketeering charges.  Is that correct?    Okay.  It specifically then talks toenclosing - as referred to in paragraph 1 – an application as – sorry paragraph 1.1 is the application for authority.  1.2 is the proposed indictment and 1.3 are the draft authorisations.  The recommendation is for the authorisation to be granted.  This particular document - while we do not have the annexures to this document – was signed in fact by Advocate Noko?    Okay.  Who signed – do you know who signed the indictment that ought to have been enclosed with this    Thank you and are you aware whether or not in accordance with procedure there was a prosecution    In support of this application?  Thank you and is this the authorisation that was then subsequently challenged to which a finding was granted by Justice Gorven?    Thank you.  If I can then move on toEXHIBIT Z(K).    And then.    As it pleases Chair.  Before we move onto the next document this blue document is the first authorisation in 12?     The second document which is Exhibit ZK is dated 18 August 2015 which relates to the second authorisation.     Apologies, Exhibit ZA, it’s in his main affidavit.     Yes Chair.     Page 23 paragraph 75.     Thank you, if we then look at Exhibit ZK there does not appear to be many paragraph references but if you look at page two...(intervention).      Page two of Exhibit ZK.     ZK.     So paragraph one reads that this document is essentially an application for fresh authorisation of racketeering charges against you and several others. On page two i t talks to certain documents that ought to have been enclosed which we do not have in support of the application and 1.1 lists it as theapplication for authority, 1.2 the fresh prosecution memorandum, 1.3 the proposed indictment and 1.4 the draft authoris ations, is that correct?     Now in this regard earlier youreferred to a prosecution memorandum and a PowerPoint presentation.      Are those the two documents that may have been referred to in this particular letter?      Thank you, just to highlight, on page three of the same Exhibit ZK paragraph four details the documents/evidence upon which – rather which were considered for purposes of this application and in particular it lists at least seven     Thank you Chair.   If you could then go back to Exhibit ZG which is the Mokgoro report on page 121, we’ve dealt with the prosecution memo and without detracting fro m the detail that is stated in here it continues to page 127 which very briefly, at sub -paragraph 5.2.1.13 deals with the manner in which the Booysen matter was dealtwith.  The next pertinent point is at the bottom of page 127 which talks about – or rather it is titled at paragraph 5.2.1.14 which is Mosing’s? version.  Who exactly was advocate Mosing in the context of the investigation?    If I may Chair, yesterday during consultation with General Booysen there’s – it’s a document that General Booysen had prepared which is a typed version of the copy of    My humble apologies Chair.      It’s Annexure JB12 which is in fileZA page 145.     No that’s the copy that is in the file.      It’s Exhibit ZA page 145.     General Booysen had typed up his understanding of the note and with your leave I beg to hand it up.      Correct Chair.    Thank you Chair.      Please proceed General Booysen.    Thank you and what exactly was  your concern or problem with the recordal as you understood it to be in relation to the Minister holding this meeting and calling for arrests within that week?      Thank you Chair, if I can then take you to your statement which is in Bundle ZA we are now, effectively dealing with your paragraph references from 77 and 78 on page 24 – 24of your statement.  General Booysen you have made various references to other perceived interferences by Minister Mthethwa, if I can take you to page 146 which is Annexure JWB13.      147 sorry.    General Booysen can you identify this document please?      Thank you and what is your     Thank you Chair.  If I can then take you to the next...(intervention).     In continuance of your evidence concerning your understanding of Minister Mthethwa’s involvement I ask you to go to page 149 which is Annexure JWB14 of the sameBundle Exhibit ZA.     As it pleases Chair.    If – if I may Chair.    In the timeline to the Mokgoro Report.    Reference is made there that   That you may find.    Unfortunately not.    The other date.    That was alluded to earlier in relationto the letter by Mdluli to the former President.     At – in the timeline at page 355.    It is recorded   Yes.CHAIRPERSON   Okay.    Okay.    At paragraph 93 you deal withAdvocate Jiba’s role in prosecuting you for racketeering but you have certainly dealt with that in extensive detail earlier.     At page 29 which is paragraph 94 you deal with additional involvement of Jiba in processes.  Can youplease deal with that part?   Before we move onto Advocate Sello Maema I just wish to alert you Chair.     That mention has been made of the Justice Jakob Fact Finding Commission in the Mokgoro Report as well.     At page 317.    Chair.    Chair if I may it has just beenpointed out to me that again in this Mokgoro Report at paragraph 253 page 85 it is recorded that Breytenbach was involved in the prosecution of Mdluli to answer the question.    As you have raised earlier.    Yes.    No problem.    Can you just please clarify who do you say lied under oath?     At paragraph 105 you talk about the suspensions of Mr Robert McBride, General Dramat and yourself were held to be unlawful in court whilst the others did not challenge their suspensions and it was consequent to these persecutions various Hawks and SARS investigations were compromised.Which investigations are you specifically referring to in your view?   At page 6 you talk about Advocate Maema’s involvement in the Brett Kebble matter.    Just in line with the slide that we have before us Advocate Maema was involved in the Cato Manorinvestigation only in relation to those four investigations at least?     Thank you.  You please proceed then to Advocate Anthony Mosing.    If we could then move to page 34 of your affidavit and paragraph 110 at which you deal with  Okay and who appointed Advocate Noko?    Will do Chair.    Okay.CHAIRPERSON   Will do Chair.    Thank you.     And in particular the criminal complaint that she laid pursuant to that?      Yes.     Page 36 you then deal with Advocate Doctor Torie Pretorius, will you please address the Chair in relation to your observations of the matt ers that Pretorius was involved in.     Thank you Chair, at paragraph 36 you talk to Advocate Pretorius, Dr Torie Pretorius.      And that’s specifically, to make sureI understand this, that’s specifically the t ranscript of the interview of Advocate Noko?     Thank you Chair.CHAIRPERSON    At page 38 from paragraph 1 to 4 you deal with the next Advocate who is Advocate Sean Abrahams, who appointed Advocate Sean Abrahams?      Okay.  Who is – who preceded, who was the previous incumbent to his position?      Mr Toshan Panday.     No Chair.     Male fides Chair?     Were you involved General Booysen in the legal process which led to Nomgcobo Jiba’s prosecution?      In your view did you su ffer any consequences as a result of laying this complaint against Advocate Jiba?     Having said that General Booysen if I can ask you to go to page 182 paragraph 39 of the same bundle.      It’s page 182, paragraph 39. 
 MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well I did Chair.  I said to him well what is this all about.  These are normal police  photographs. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSL BOOYSEN:  Indeed Chair.

CHAIRERSON:   Ja but your recollection is that it is in the bundle or you are not sure? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WES SEL BOOYSEN:  It will be 2.3 Chair.
