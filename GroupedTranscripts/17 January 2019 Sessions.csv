CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.     Thank you Mr Agrizzi thank you.  Are you ready Mr Pretorius?      Yes.    Okay.    Oh yes thank you.  Are being informed that it is signed?    Oh.  Well this is S2 that I have here.    Yes.   Yes.  Oh okay no I am sorry I am confusing you.     Okay alright.    Okay thank you.  Before you start there is just one or two – there are just one or two questions that I want to put to Mr Agrizzi just to round off on a question that I asked yesterday.  Mr Agrizzi when I asked you yesterday about the amount of – the total amount of cash payments per month, you asked me whether I wanted you to talk about only cash payments.  I got the impression that there were other forms of payments that you wanted to talk about.  I know that you have given evidence relating to items of groceries and so on and so on.  The question I want to put to you is whether there were – whether the gifts that were paid out, or were givento certain people were regular in the same way as the cash payments?  In other words, were they like monthly as well, or they were given as occasion was considered to demand?    Yes okay no that is fine.  And I think when I asked you the question about cash payments yesterday; I was talking about when you started – when you were given this responsibility for the first time of handling cash andkeeping records.  Now the amounts that you told us about R4 million to R6 million per month.    Do they relate to right at the beginning when you were starting to do this – execute the responsibility, or were those amounts the amounts as well when you left with Bosasa?    When you started on this responsibility, can you remember or can you not remember?    Okay.    Well I have seen R4 million to R6 million in your affidavit as well, but I cannot remember whether you do specify as to those payments having been –or that applying to the time that you left or much earlier.    But I think it is helpful enough for me if you say, at least by the time you left they were – Bosasa was spending between R4 million to R6 million in terms of cash payments per month in bribes.    Thank you.  Mr Pretorius?    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Going back to ACSA, that contract was it for the provision of security services, or was it for more than that?    Oh okay thank you.      Thank you.    Well before he does – I am sorry Mr Agrizzi.  The documents that were placed there, were they placed there so that, they could seem to be a basis toclaim privilege and therefore deny access in case there is a raiding, or they were there because that is where they legitimately could be?    So the documents that were sought to be protected by this writing, were documents relating to the SLU?    And the NPA.  Were the documents that – Bosasa had legitimately acquired?    So they were there unlawfully?    Thank you.      Maybe before he – maybe he should go back a little bit, I did not see whether the face of the person is shown on the – an arm or something.  Can he just go back a little bit?      So he was carrying out your instructions in taking ...[intervenes]    The – okay I am sorry.  Is it the person who took the video that you instructed to take the video, or is it Mr van Tonder that you instructed to take the box out?    And both were done at your instructions – on your instructions?    Yes but you ...[intervenes]    You knew about it?    Okay thank you.      Okay.    Okay.      And for completeness, you told us yesterday that there were about eight vaults, do they all have this writing?    Okay right and they have documents inside?    Okay thank you.      The ones you told us about yesterday?    Maybe just for the sake of completeness, I wanted to ask this question yesterday.  At a practical level at Bosasa, were they only used for cash, for bribes, or were they also used for other legitimate payments?   Okay thank you.      You said he has the desk and the chair there, is that right?    Would that desk be the desk where he would count the cash that would go to the cash bags, or – in other words, is it used for counting the cash, or does he sit there to do anything else?    Okay thank you.   Ja probably ...[intervenes]    Yes just try again.      Okay.     Ja okay.     Is that the clearest picture of his face that we can have here on this or not?   Okay, alright.    As far as you knew would they have been very confidential legitimate business files or would they fall in the same category as the NPA and SLU documents that you put in the vault that you told us about earlier?    Okay thank you.    Yes.    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay we will take five minutes, we will resume at 10   Thank you, we adjourn.    Yes Mr Pretorius?   Please just raise your voice, I think because you have moved back so it is not coming across clearly.    Yes, you say there is money in a bag?    And the colour of the two is – the colours are different.    The plastic bag that is on the desk there, I assume is not the, one of the bags, the type that you told us about yesterday because this one seems to be transparent.  You said those other ones are not or am I mistaken?    Okay thank you.    The vehicles being provided by Bosasa companies to Government officials.    Being those vehicles would be given to Government officials on the basis of them being donations or just for use for a certain period of time and return them after some time?    Oh they were not themselves bribes, it was a contractual thing.    Ja okay, thank you.    Those, the items we are now talking about, the items that seemsto, I do now know whether protrude is the right word, on his left-hand side, those are the items we are talking about.    And those bags are the ones that you told us about, which were used for cash for bribed?    Thank you.    You have just sequenced the events, you said number one up to four, I take it that what you mean is that when we see him carrying those bags as we see him now, it was – that is part of a process that started with Mr Gavin Watson at the desk or is it a different occasion?  In other words cash gets taken out of the safe and then that is one, then there is two, there is three, there is four?  In other words is that what you are saying, it is connected to that process or to Mr Gavin Watson when we saw him sitting at the desk or it is the same sequence but this might have been a different occasion?   Thank you very much.    Oh before, I am sorry Mr Agrizzi just before you move on I think I just want to have this clarified but I think you have said it but I want to be sure about it.  Are you able to say throughout the time that you were employed at Bosasa, whether both the times when it was called Dyambu and when it was called Bosasa, throughout that time you have never seen these bags carrying anything other than bribes?    And that is a period spanning close to?   19 Years, so it is highly unlikely that anybody can say it was usedto carry anything else?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Thank you very much.    Yes, yes, yes please feel free to do so.    Yes.  Ja, ja.    Thank you.   Ja.    Ja.    Oh the bottom shelf?    The bottom shelf.    Yes.    Yes.    Right at the bottom shelf?    Yes.    Mm.    Thank you.    Now the money that you would drop in the drop safe.    Would it be money that was coming from the banks, that had been withdrawn from the banks, which would later on be used as bribe money or coming from other Bosasa entities or from where cash could be obtained?    No, I was just wondering where it was coming from because I was doubting that it could be coming from the banks.    Okay, alright thank you.    Tell us how you can tell.   Oh you did a lot of these?    Okay thank you.  So Mr Watson is carrying money and you are able to say exactly how much it is?   Ja alright, thank you.    Ja that is fine.    That is fine.    Well before that ...[intervenes].    Oh I am sorry.  So is it correct that Mr Leshabane, Mr Joe Gumede and Mr Gavin Watson are in the same room?    So when we saw Mr Leshabane earlier on, where he was standing and seeming to be speaking on a cell phone and having on his left those bags ofmoney that we talked about, he was in the same room that Mr Gavin Watson was at the same time and Mr Joe Gumede either was at the same time or later came into is that right?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay thank you.  So now with the four people in the room, and now that we, well earlier on we saw cash on – money on Mr Watson's desk and now we see Mr Watson carrying cash, and you have told us how much it is, based onyour experience would Mr Gavin Watson's role be to take out the money and give to whoever, like Mr Leshabane who might have wanted to take it somewhere?  In other words would he be the one who would count the money and say okay this is the money I am giving you to give to whoever you want to give to?    Okay thank you.    I am sorry just repeat that Mr Agrizzi?    Yes.    Before you proceed you have told us that there are four people in the room there.    You have told us that over the 19 years or so that you worked forBosasa these bags were used for nothing else but bribe money.    Now are you able to say very positively that each and every one of the four persons in that room knows exactly what this money is for?  In other words nobody can claim that it is for something else.  Are you able to say that very positively?    Thank you.  Yes you may proceed.    I am sorry I do not see the bottom of the screen that has got – I see what appears to be some boxes in the second shelf from the top, is that what you are talking about?   The one ...[intervenes].    Ja.    Okay the one that he seems to be carrying?    Oh okay, those must – but did you say that is Mr Gumede?   That is Mr Leshabane?    Yes.    Yes, yes.    Okay can I ask you something else?  I see that Mr Gavin Watson, Mr Joe Gumede and Mr Leshabane are all wearing what appears to me to be grey shirts.  I do not know if the pants are dark.  Was that they uniform or what?    Okay is what I call grey, blue?  That is blue?    Okay, alright thank you.  So it was uniform?   Okay.    No, no it is okay thank you.    I am easy.  We – maybe it might be convenient to finish the video.  I am not sure.  I have a better idea of how long ...[intervenes].    Will be a while.    Okay you would suggest we take the adjournment now?    Ja.   Yes.    Okay we will take the tea adjournment and we will resume at    Yes Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Yes thank you.  Mr Agrizzi?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No thank you very much Mr Agrizzi for bringing that to myattention.  Mr Pretorius will you direct some members of the legal team to be in touch with – or the secretary, I see Reverent Stimela is here.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes and is somebody attending immediately to tightening the security in terms of people coming in and out, or coming to the hearings in terms of what they show and so on?    Is tight ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Was used.    Ja.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay please do that and whatever steps, additional steps may be taken to minimise the prospects that somebody could go through the system using something that is not legitimate should be looked into.    Ja and ...[intervenes].    And then at some stage, it is just that I do not know at what stage the report from that investigation will be avail but it will be important that Mr Agrizzialso gets to know what the investigation into that incident discovered.  Okay thank you.    Yes thank you very much.  Thank you Mr Agrizzi.    Thank you.    Are you seeking to draw a distinction between maybe different uses of the grey bags now or not really?  I am trying to understand the point.    Oh I see.   Yes.  Yes but the money that you are talking about that you would give to them.    Was also unlawful was it not, bribes?    So it is just that they were – it was not money to be bribe money tobe paid to outsiders, it was being paid to personnel within the company?    Yes, yes.    Yes.  No, no, no, thank you for that.    Well it might not be necessary to remind him all the time provided now he – I inform him that until you finish your evidence, whether it is today, tomorrow or Monday or next week or whatever time, until you finish it you are under the same oath that you took at the beginning.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes, no that is fine.  It is important to just mention so that there is no misunderstanding that that oath applies throughout.  Thank you.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    But you were using the word bonus because that is the word that was being used in Bosasa in regard to those particular ones?    Ja, ja, ja.    I am sorry, you, in response to one, the first question from Mr Pretorius in this set of questions that he has just finished you refer to some bagsbeing used predominantly for bribes.  Are there two types of bags that you are distinguishing between here?    Yes.    Ja no, let me just make sure.  I just want to make sure I – most ofthe time, if not all the time when we have spoken, when you have spoken about bags and money since yesterday, you have spoken about the grey bags that are not transparent.    Now earlier on you said in the 19 years or so that you were at Bosasa, those bags were never used for anything other than bribe money.    You stand by that?    Okay.  Now in the first question of the last set of questions that Mr Pretorius asked you, you referred, you said something about predominantly, something being predominantly used for bribe money.  Were you referring to the same bags, the grey bags or was it a different type of bag?    Yes.   Yes, yes.    Yes.    Oh okay, okay, okay.  So that answer stands?    Thank you.    Thank you.    Yes do that.    Could it be a code language for something?    Ja.    Ja that should be fine.    Yes sure.    Yes, is he carrying something?    You cannot tell whether it is something he is carrying or something on the door?    Okay.    Oh okay.    Ja.  Are you not going back now?    That is fine.  Ja.    That pace, is there something we can do nothing about?    Okay.    Okay.    Is that the best volume?    Okay.  Thank you.    Who is counting there?  Who is counting?    Okay.   What is the significance of the monopoly part of it?    In other words, is there any special meaning to be given?  Why is he referring to it as monopoly money?    Yeah.  Okay.  Alright.    So monopoly in this sense being, you know Bosasa wanted to monopolise contracts.  State contracts.    Thank you.    Yes you may continue.VIDEO PLAYING    Did he say 5 million at some stage?    No.  Okay.    500 thousand.    100 thousand yeah.   Yes.  Okay.  Thank you.    And you remind us that when you say a hundred, you mean 0 thousand.   Ja.  Thank you.    So you are able to tell that that stack of what appears like 100 notes – R100 notes.      Is actually a million.    Yes.   You did earlier but maybe just do it again.  It was not a million then, but just do it again.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay.    Yes.    Yes.  No, no.  It is fine.    You have said that the security, grey security bags were used only for the bribe money.    But, I would imagine that some of the money that was kept there could be used as well for something other than bribe money for example, Mr Watson if he could take any money there and use it for personally or maybe even yourself or somebody else within the company if they needed some money they could also just take money from there or did that not happen?    In other words we know that the bags were used only to – for the bribe money but was the money that was there used only for purposes of bribes or sometimes it was used just personally or to buy something in the company?    [Indistinct] yes.    Ja, ja.    Yes, yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Or the company secretary, you talked earlier on about the company secretary having keys, that would be to the vault but not to the safe.    Thank you.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  Now this money for bribes, was it only kept in Mr Gavin Watson's safe or was it – were there other safes also where this money was kept?    That would be the one which had Mr Gavin Watson's safe and another one, how do you describe the other one?    Okay, did that one also have corruption money if I can call it that or that was just used for – whatever money was kept in that one was just legitimate money?    Now money that was kept for purposes of bribery, what kind of amounts on any one day would you say they would be talking about that will be kept there?  Obviously it would not be this – well maybe not obviously but I assume it would not be the same every day but on average you – during the time that you were at Bosasa the lowest amount you ever became aware of on any particular day X millions or X hundreds of thousands and the maximum that you got to know at any one stage?    Yes.   Yes.    No, that is in order.  Ja that is in order, yes.    Yes thank you.    Yes, yes.   Now you did talk earlier on about money sometimes coming from places such as Zimbabwe.  When you refer to the supplier of money just as you havedone a minute ago, would that supplier be somebody from within Bosasa who would have been given money by somebody from outside of Bosasa or could it also be – could that supplier who hands it over to somebody in the company, did you say on the side of the road on Lenasia, could that somebody be an outsider from Bosasa?    Yes.    Okay thank you.    Yes.    Okay.    To the extent that that stack of money might not be the same that we saw earlier on where you were able to tell us how much it is, could you – can you tell us how much that is?    Okay thank you.   Ja before Mr Pretorius asks you some questions, how often would the safe need to be refilled, that is Mr Gavin Watson's safe need to be filled and at what intervals, if you are able to tell me?    And are you able to say that maybe at a particular time the total number of people that were "looked after" monthly were – was X, maybe 20 maybe 50 at any particular time where you can remember, you say I think around that year at that time or just before you left the number would have been around a particular figure, people that were being paid cash monthly.    Yes, yes.  You may do that.    Or otherwise we can… Maybe we can…  You can deal with that question after lunch.  Maybe, so during the lunch break you can just check what you need to check.      Ja, that is fine, together with the other question.    Do you remember the other one?  You remember the other one.    Yes.  Okay.  Alright.    The first one was, at any… What was the total amount of money being kept in Mr Gavin Watson’s safe on average and on any particular day.  So I just wanted… Maybe he might be able to say, you know, normally about so much, but it could go as high as whatever on a particular day.  So that was the first one, which hewill look at.  Then the second one is, how regular they had to refill as it were, Mr Gavin Watson’s safe with money for bribery.    Oh yes, thank you. [Intervenes].    Yes.  How many people were being paid bribes at some stage, you know, like in a particular month, he might be able to talk maybe more for the time closer to when he left to say maybe 20 people, 50 people or whatever.  Thank you.    That is personally, to use for your own personal use as opposed to you paying bribes.    To do as you please with it.      Ja, okay.    And because you knew all these criminal activities.    Ja.  So also… So in effect not only to keep you happy, but also to make sure that you see no reason to get out of this or to talk.    Yes.    And this way of bribing people as distant from a situation where you pay somebody a once off amount, this way where you pay them every month or atcertain intervals continuously, are you able to say whether actually that would contribute to, maybe this is obvious…  Contribute to making sure that, if I am in a government department, or if I am in a company where Bosasa has a contract that is going to be coming to an end and I have influence and I know that if this contract of Bosasa is not extended or renewed, I will not be getting these extra cash, then in all probability, I would be doing whatever I can for the contract to be renewed and to be extended because if it is extended then I continue to enjoy the lifestyle that I have become used to.    Because if you give me money on a once off basis, maybe when the tender is awarded, I might let up on, I think well, I have used that money and that is it.  You know it is gone or I have got it already, but if it is continuous as you say, I get used to a certain lifestyle which I do not want to change.  At least not for the worse.    You see, we all know that Bosasa has been… There has been allegations of corruption up against Bosasa that have been in the media for many, many years ...[intervenes]    And it has continued to have contracts within Government,notwithstanding that, so this might provide the explanation because people who may have had the power to stop the contracts did not stop them because they were continuing to benefit on a continuous basis and if they stopped the contracts to Bosasa or did not renew them, they would be adversely affected in terms of the monetary value that they were getting from Bosasa.    Can I… I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Can I just go back to what we discussed two minutes ago.    During your time at Bosasa, are you able to say to give an estimate of about maybe how many Government contracts Bosasa might have had… Let us say during the five years preceding your departure from them or maybe preceding the pastyears.  I mean if you get… If you are not accurate, I do not mind.  I just want to havean idea.  Could it be something in the region of 10 or 20 or are you not able to say?    Yes.    Well I was actually going to come to that, to ask whether of the contracts that Bosasa had during your time.  Maybe particularly 10 years… The last 10 years before you left, are you able to say, look really there was a legitimate…  Any legitimate contract that Bosasa got from Government or any Government entity.  They    Yes, but what about extensions and the extensions of contracts. Would the extensions in your experience have likely been influenced by bribery or you are not able to say?    Ja, but you think most were influenced by corruption.    Okay.  Or maybe one could put it more neutrally to say whether or not the extensions came about as a result of bribes might be one thing, but would you be able to say that where contracts… Bosasa’s contracts with Government departments were to be extended, more likely than not, there would be people that would already bythen be recipients of bribery.    Thank you.    Thank you.    I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Is there any… Does this mean there will be one person to handle him and another person to pay him or is it one person handling him and paying him.    Oh it is coming.      Okay.    Okay.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Okay.  Alright.    Yes.    If he is going to clarify it that is fine.    Okay.  Yes.    Well I thought Mr Pretorius, you said the context would come from    Ja, if I a knew that, I would have asked for the answer then.   I thought you were saying the context was going to come from this.    Ja, let me here now.ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC   Let me here now.    Oh.    Oh.MR ANGELO AGRIZZI   Yeah.  Okay, so the handling, refers to doing certain things for him,other than paying him.  I do not know whether I should say managing him but maybe that is not the correct term, but doing certain things to help him whenever he might need help other than cash.    And this concept of handling the recipients of this money, apart from paying them.    Did it apply to all the recipients?  In other words, they had to behandled, managed or most of them?    Did you say Mr Biebuyck was an attorney?    Ja, okay.    Please do so.    And the other Patrick was not getting that amount.    That amount… The only Patrick that was getting that amount was Mr Gillingham.    Okay.  Alright.     And maybe just to go back a little bit, where a person such asyourself was the one assigned the responsibility to pay a particular recipient, was that person required to be the one who hands the cash over physically to the recipient or could they give it somebody else to hand it over or depended on situations on availability?  I am just trying to see to what extent for example when you tell us that you were the one to pay X, that we can take it that it means that normally you would hand the cash over personally to that person.    Oh, so in your case, when it was said that you would pay so and so, it meant paying the intermediary, the other person like a director of Bosasa who would need money to pay a recipient.  It did not mean that you were the one to physically pay the ultimate recipient.   You are correct, with one exception that sometimes the person was not around and I would have to pay the recipient directly in various cases.    Okay.  Thank you.    Before you proceed Mr Pretorius, what motivated the taking of this video or why did it happen and who… I think you said you arranged for it to be taken.  Can you give that background?    Okay.    Yes.  Tell us about the disposing.  Sounds like people being taken out in coats during a certain era in our country.  Tell us about disposing…  People being disposed of.  What do you mean?    Yes?    Ximba.  X I M B A.    Ja.      Do I understand you correctly that you wanted to be able to prove that you were not the only one who was involved in these criminal activities.    So you wanted to make sure you would have a strong case to show that you are not the only one.    Yes.    Yes.  So in other words already at that time when you arranged for the video to be taken, you were having in mind that you wanted to share this information with the nation.  Is that right?    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will resume at    Yes.  Thank you.  We were supposed to resume at 14
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair.     Yes we are Chair.        We are about to show to the Commission a video recording.  The words on the video recording insofar as they are audible have been transcribed into a document, which has been handed to you in an envelope. However, that transcription is not signed by the transcriber so may I replace that with another?  This is EXHIBIT 2.    EXHIBIT S2.    Yes.  I am sorry I gave you the wrong number Chair, it is S4, this is EXHIBIT S4.    Yes well remember Chair the first bundle is S1 now.      The second bundle is S2, is that right?    The video we are playing will be EXHIBIT S3 and the transcript of that video is S4.    That transcript should actually be placed into the bundle, but we will do that at a later stage.      In relation to your questions Chair, there are a number of issues of detail and clarification that have arisen.    And that will arise during the course of the testimony.    That will require attention.    It is our intention to assess the evidence perhaps tomorrow and then do a comprehensive sweep as it were of the evidence to provide that detail.  But may I ask, before we play the video just three questions?    That may clarify evidence given yesterday.    We will go out of sequence now a little Mr Agrizzi, you will forgive me.  You gave evidence yesterday of three contracts at Goldfields?    And these contracts were awarded, or were entered into at the time you transferred from Molope Foods to Dyambu?   They involved the Libanon Mine, the Kloof Mine and the Leeudoring Mine?    What was the approximate value to Dyambu?    Over a period of time?    Yes but that per annum it was not one year contract was it?    It was for longer than one year?    Then in relation to ACSA you gave evidence of payments to officials of the Airports' Company of South Africa?     The value of the contracts at the time the payments were made, approximate value to Bosasa, what was that value?    Right.  Then you spoke about a later period in relation to ACSA 2009/2010, do you recall that?   What was the value of the contracts at that time?    Okay.  We will go into that detail when we do the review of your evidence and fine tune the detail.    Then in relation to the South African Post Office, at the time payments were made, what was the value of the contracts then?   Right.  There are other matters that we will have to clarify, or provide more detail in relation to, but we will do that at a later stage.      Mr Agrizzi we were at paragraph 12.6 of your affidavit and in that affidavit you say you have available a video, you have made that video available to the Commission and the Commission has now arranged to show that video.  But before we do so, can we place this video in its context.  You did not take this video?   Right.  You do know that there is corroborative evidence available in relation to the content of the video, a yes or no will suffice?    Yes.  The video shows movements into a vault, activities in a vault and movements in the immediate vicinity of the vault.    You know that vault, I understand?    And do you know the contents of the vault from yourown memory?    Are you able to recognise the scenes on the video?    The persons who speak on the video, do you know them?    Are you able to recognise them?    And can you identify their voices?    The activities in the vault and immediately outside the vault, are those activities that were at the time unusual, were they common place?      Are you aware of those activities?   Alright.  So you are able then to assist the Commission as I understand it to describe exactly what happens on the video?    Alright.  Do you have Exhibit S4 in front of you, that is the transcript, the new transcript?  We will provide you with a copy.    If you would bear with me one moment Chair.      The detail on the video is related to timing on thevideo.  When you show that video will you just check please where the timing is shown?      So just play on a bit and see if the timing is shown on the screen?    No I am not talking about the transcript Mr Agrizzi, the actual video.    You know that when one plays a video ...[intervenes]    On occasion you can see how many seconds or minutes have been played.    And then one can go to a particular point in the video.    Are those facilities available now?    Okay.  Alright let us go to the beginning of the video if you can and that is the screenshot on the screen at the moment.  That image that you see on the screen.    What is that?    And do you know what the writing on that safe was at the time?    What was it?    Because privileged documents were in the safe?    Alright.  Would you play then to 48 seconds please?    Alright.  Would you play the video please?    And stop at 48 seconds.  Right perhaps stop there.  What is shown on the video there?    Alright.  Well as far as the video is concerned he is taking out a box?   Okay.  Just play on it will become clearer.  Those shelves there, are they in the vault or outside the vault?    Right.  Please play on.  Okay stop there.  Is that the box to which you were referring?    And you know from the video and your own personal knowledge the identity of the person who was holding that box?    Who was he?    What – he was, yes?    Of?    Alright.  Please play on.    Okay stop there please.  Up until that point, it is clear from the video that one cannot recognise the person handling the box?    How do you know that that is Mr van Tonder?   And is the person handling the box taking the video?    Why can you not see the face of the person handling the box Mr van Tonder?    Where is the camera, or the cell phone camera?    Okay.  Alright, the video has just shown a person, if you could go back please.  Stop.  Who is that?  That is at 48 seconds I understand it.   Now if we play to 1 minute 22 seconds, you will during that section of the video hear someone talking and someone outside the vault?    Just play it and then tell the Chair please what is appearing on the video and who is talking.    Stop please.  Chair if you go to the transcript, the words being spoken appear in the transcript.   Who is the male who is talking there?    Right.  Please continue.    And they simply greet at this stage?    Continue please.  Okay would you stop there please.  What is happening now?    What is the relevance of Consilium here?    Alright.  So the box has being transported from where to where?    So we have two vaults here.  The first vault is the vault that we saw in the first part of the video that you have just played, is thatcorrect?    And you say that vault resides in the company's secretary's office?    And that person who was seen on the video, the female person is in fact the company's secretary?    The box insofar as there is evidence necessary to confirm that that is available is being transported from that vault to another vault?    And the latter vault is Gavin Watson's vault near the Consilium offices?    Alright.  Just please play on to 1   Right.  And if you could just play on to 1   I hope I can warn you in time to stop.  But just before you see the person in the video there is a scene that I want you to comment onplease.    Stop there please.  That sign there, where does that sign exist?    It is there, stop.  Where are we on the video in terms of minutes and seconds?    Right.  You show there a notice on a door, on what looks like a door.    So that is the door to Gavin Watson's vault, it has the same sign regarding privilege?   The sign client privilege as existed on the safe in the secretary's office?    Alright just play.    Just play on for a second if you would.  Further please, stop.  You see there an olive green or grey container or cupboard or safe, what is that?    Right now that safe is the subject matter of some testimony to come?    Right.  And if you look towards the bottom of the screen, you will see some items, what are those?    Right you have given ...[intervenes]   And what is the use – just remind Chair please, what is the use of those bags?    Go on please.      Right.  Go on please until you see a person standing at a table, or sitting at a table.  I stand corrected.  Go back please.  It should be at    Stop.  Who is that person in the blue shirt?    And where is he seated?    Is he in the vault or outside the vault?    Right.  Go on please.  Does he say anything at this stage?   Alright.    Carry on please until you see a second door too, later    No take your time please, it is evidence that we must do properly.  We do not see his full face, although that ...[intervenes]     Maybe because of where you stopped on the video.    If you would bear with me a moment Chair.    I am told by our expert we do not have a facility that allows frame by frame movement on the video.  So if you would just bear with us Chair.    Okay.  In the video now immediately after the scenewhere Gavin Watson is seated at his desk, you see another person.  Who is that person?    And where is that person seated?    Alright, and that is at 1   Behind him there are some items in the shelves, what are those items?    Members of the legal teams, I seem to be sharper than ours Mr Agrizzi, would you go back please to the scene where Mr Gavin Watson is seated at his desk, that is 1 minute 50 and 1 minute 51.   Stop.  I am told that there are some items on the desk which may be necessary to identify, if you could go back please.  Do you see immediately in front of Mr Watson on the desk there are some items, if you could try and stop the video there.  Stop.  Just missed it.    Chair, may I ask if you would bear with us for a moment, we do have a person skilled in these technological matters.    He says to me that he would appreciate an opportunity to check whether we have a frame by frame function.   On this computer.    Which will save a lot of time ultimately because there is a lot to play where 1 minute, nearly 2 minutes through a 6 minute video.    And the detail later needs more precision than now.  So if we could just take five minutes please.    Thank you Chair.    Thank you for that opportunity Chair.  Mr Agrizzi the scene now on the video is at what timing?    Alright, and that is immediately after you have seen an image of a person you described as Gavin Watson?    And is that Gavin Watson's desk there?    We have spoken about that, and it is immediately before the video moves on to a person you identified as Mr Gumede?   Do you see what is on the desk there?    Alright.    Alright, now it would be difficult to conclude, just from what we see on the video, that those are R100 notes, are you relying on otherinformation or memory to say what you say?    Mr Agrizzi would you play through to 1 minute 57 seconds, we have dealt with some of the scenes already in evidence but if there is anything between there an 1 minute 57 seconds that you wish to comment on please do so.    Alright.    To there, stop.  Stop.  Alright could you stop at – hang on.    Stop.    Stop there please.  The ...[intervenes].   Yes please.    Alright.    Just please record what minute and second reading?    And it is just before that.    That one sees the scene where you say there is aclearer picture?    No it is okay, the pictures become clearer later.    So we can move on.    Who is that person at 1   Who is he?  Who was he at the time?    Spell that please Kgwerano.    Do not move on please.  If you look carefully in his left hand, the person you have identified as Mr Leshabane, appears to be speaking on the phone.    On a cell phone.    In his other hand or somehow attached to him or next to him, behind him what are those items?    You see them again.  Oh sorry you must say yes or no because ...[intervenes].    The record will not pick up the nod.    And it is on that basis that you conclude that there is money in them because obviously one cannot see what is in them on the video.    And as I understand it you are saying that the scenes you have described as they appear on the video, are consistent with the system of which you are fully aware and which you conducted yourself?   Would you play through then to 2 minutes 16 seconds, and if there is anything in that period that you wish to highlight to the Chair please stop and do so.    Carry on please.  You do hear some sounds on the soundtrack of the video that might be familiar to you, I do not know if you want to comment on those but please continue.    Carry on please.    The olive green safe you spoke about earlier?    Is it the same safe?    There are two safes visible on the screen at the moment.    You are talking about the shorter one?    Do you see it at floor level in the safe?    Just pause there for a moment please.  Would you please tell the Chair what is a drop safe?    What purpose does it serve?    And you have an anecdote to tell, I believe, about how easy it was to protect your hands or otherwise.    Chair if I may say at this stage the obtaining of cash and related laundering of money is thoroughly dealt with further on in the statement.  There were various sources of cash.   Yes you are correct.    Alright.    Proceed please.  Is that Gavin Watson there that has just been shown?    At what timing?   And is he carrying anything?    Is there a possibility of getting that any clearer?    Are you able to confirm what you saw in that clip?    There at that point.    What point on the video is that?    And ...[intervenes].    If you play onto 2   Sorry stop there please.  Stop there please.  Someone is speaking in a language, do you recognise it?    Alright.    Where are you – I am sorry Chair.    Let us go on please.  We are now at 2   Yes just before ...[intervenes].    I am sorry Chair, just before that he leaves the bag, he leaves with the two bags, I understand it at 2 minutes 17 seconds.  Just before that another person whom you have identified I think as Joe Gumede says something, he mentions a figure, would you try and find that please?   And you will see in the transcript, Annexure S4, halfway down the first page a transcript there of what our transcribers say is being said.    Yes please.    Stop there please.  What did you hear there on the soundtrack?    Carry on please.    Alright so you say that the soundtrack shows or has a statement that is audible, and the words 10 000 are clearly audible?    Who to your know says that?    Do you recognise the voice?    So you know his voice?    Alright now at the screenshot now visible on the video who is that?  You see his arm but you have seen the scenes before and after.    And are you sure of that?    And what do you see at the bottom of the screen?    Alright, okay.    Mr Agrizzi then at 2   If you would play through to 2 minutes 24 seconds,and again if there is anything in that sequence that you wish to draw to the Chair's attention please do so.    Alright, who is speaking at this stage?    Alright, and if you look at the transcript, that is Exhibit S4, and in the middle of the page you see words attributed on the transcript to Joe Gumede.  By listening to the video soundtrack and by referring to the transcript, which you can accept for present purposes is more or less correct, would you tell the Chair what is being said at that stage?    Alright, Chair, I do not know if you want to play the video through and then take the short adjournment or whether you – so that the witness can just have a look at the video in the break, if you want to take the short adjournment now.   We will be a while.    Because the scenes that come later may require more attention.    I do.  It will give the witness a chance to ...[intervenes].    Look at the words or hear the words being said and to look at the words being said and then tell you.    When we reconvene, what has happened at this stage on the video.    Before we continue with the video, Mr Agrizzi has expressed to me a concern that he wishes to relay to you.    I know something of it but I think it best that he relaysit to you directly.    I have received a report.    Chair, and I am aware that investigations are underway.    And a full report will be produced by the Commission's security personnel.    Chair, the security is as tight ...[intervenes].    As can be.   But there are obviously occasions on which it can be avoided or evaded.    And this appears to be one of those occasions.    Mr Agrizzi says a police card ...[intervenes].    An expired police card was used.    For the person to gain entry.    There may be more evidence about the role and function of that particular person in Bosasa's history.    But perhaps we should investigate fully and verify the allegations fully before reporting to you as a legal team, but we will do so.    Yes Chair.    But ...[intervenes].    I take notes of your comments Chair.    Just bear with me a moment thank you Mr Agrizzi.  The video that is now being shown or the particular frame of the video that is now being shown, where is that in time terms?    Right.  Is it possible to keep that indicator on?  No,    Well I have been informed that perhaps what we should do is remind the witness on each occasion that we resume after an adjournment, that the witness is still under oath.    Perhaps we should just summarise then your evidence in relation to firstly the use of cash and secondly the use of the grey security bags.  In relation to cash, and we have seen that cash and we will see more on this video, what was the use of cash?    In short bribes as you have described it?    The use of the grey security bags?    And paid both internally and externally, external to the company?    You have also mentioned the word bonus yesterday and today.    Now if someone was to come along and testify that your evidence is entirely fabricated and that all of this cash was packed in grey security bags and given as bonuses, as part of employees' terms and conditions of employment what would your response be?   Right, but factually ...[intervenes].    Would it be correct or factually incorrect?    Alright shall we go back to the video then?    So as I understand, if we may just summarise, cash in grey security bags are used for bribes?    Predominantly to bribe officials outside of the company?    But also to, as you termed, bribe people within the company to keep silent?    Alright shall we go back please then to 2   Please play it and then if you would tell the Chair what is being said in relation to the transcript.    I have thumbs up from the ...[intervenes].    Audio controllers.    Okay the last words which are audible clearly are the words "so I am just" and if one looks at the transcript under the name Joe Gumede, page 2 of Exhibit S4 you will see at the beginning the word with the numbers 10 000 and the words at the end of that section of the transcript "so I am just".  Can you tell the Chair what is said?  And you may refer to the transcript if you wish, between those two words.    Alright.  Now what the transcript says is less than that but you have been able to expand upon what the transcript says.    And we will go back to the transcribers and see if we can get a better transcript but you have told the Chair that really this money, according to Mr Gumede is for two remote controllers, R10 000 for two remotecontrollers.  Will you comment please?    Alright, so on the face of it R10 000 is requested incash for payment for two remotes.  What would the normal process be for procurement of equipment such as that?    Alright what is the cost, to your knowledge, well let us, before we ask you that, do you have experience of the items required in security installations?  Do you have experience of the cost of those items?    Alright.  What do you say to the proposition that R10 000 is required for two remotes?    What position in the company did Mr Gumede occupy at the time?    Is it normal for the chairman of the company torequest from someone such as Mr Gavin Watson, cash to buy remotes for use at an installation where Bosasa is active?    Well then the question that arises is according to your evidence all four persons in the room, the vault at the time, knew what was going on.  Why would it be necessary to say things like this, which on your version at least are highly improbable?    Well perhaps Mr Gumede would assist us at some stage.  Would you continue then with the video and please be aware of our invitation to stop at any stage.    Oh okay.    2   We can see the time now.    Yes.  If you would go on please.  At 2   Alright.    And not at the time.    Stop there please.  Someone leave the room, do you know who that is, or leaves the vault.    Yes.   On the screen now is Mr Gavin Watson.    We now have a frame by frame facility.    Stop there please.  On top of the lower safe, can you see what is on top of that safe?    What is that?    Carry on.    Alright, the lowest floor level shelf?    Of the safe yes.  Okay I think it is useful if you go frame by frame now.   Okay carry on please.    You going forward or you going back.    Yes please.  Although it takes more time, ultimately wewill save time if you go frame by frame, because then we will not be going back and forth.    Okay.    Let us see what we see first.  Frame by frame and then we can assess at that stage, what to do about the replaying with the audio.    The video continues to show the interior of the vault.  Correct?    Well that is not a problem, because what comes is clear, so let us just continue frame by frame.  It may seem tedious at this stage, but it actuallywill save time, because we will not then have to search within the video.    We need in any event to stop at 14   But go on please.  Stop there please.  Alright, can we turn up the volume there?  Stop there.      Well we are keeping people in suspense.    It is not deliberate for [Indistinct].  Perhaps what you could do is from the point that the counting what is apparently counting commences let it play and then we will come back to it and describe what is happening.  Okay, just play it at ordinary speed from there through and we can go back for the detail please.      Stop there.  That reference to monopoly money.    The phrase monopoly money, by whom was it frequently used?    If you would just stop there.  You hear one, two, three, four, five and then you hear, 1 million.  Just explain how that would come about, from your own experience?    Sorry, I am not sure if my maths coincides with yours.  If there are five piles of 100 thousand each, that would not mean a million.  If other notes were used?    Alright.    Well it becomes clearer later on if one had regard to the transcript on page 3 of EXHIBIT S4, but play on please.    Alright.  What does that show?    Yes.    I am not sure where – Sorry Chair.    I am not sure where in relation to the scenes depicted on the video this occurs, but two-thirds the way down on page 3 of the transcript, S4 you will see attribute – The following words, attributed to Gavin Watson.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8, 9, 10.  Brother, one million exactly.    Does that coincide with what you see or is it consistent with what you see?    And just before you move on please, behind the notes on    That may well be the plastic bag that was seen earlier.   Before you go on, you described earlier a drop safe into which cash would be deposited.    By amongst others yourself from time to time.    Who had access to that safe?    No, into the actual safe where the cash was kept.   Thank you, carry on please.    May we continue then Chair, with the video recording?    He says ten brother, and he is going to say something else now if we play on.  Alright please stop there.  What is audible on the soundtrack, which is confirmed by the transcript, is that the person speaking, whom you have identified as Gavin Watson, says "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten brother" and then one hears the words "one million exactly".    Alright, is that consistent with your evidence and how you recall things happened?    We then hear someone say "alright, okay I will just – now we just get that six thousand that they still owe us".  How would that come about, from your own experience and do you know factually what was being spoken about here?    Is this cash coming in?    Yes.    Alright so subject to what you will say later when you give more detail as to how cash was generated and received, for the moment you say that this reference to R6 000 is a short payment on someone who provided cash to Bosasa?    Please go on.  Stop there please.  This is a clearer shot of what you referred to earlier in relation to what appears on the lower safe.  Those, what appear to be plastic bags to which you have referred earlier, what are they?    Go on please.    Alright, now – alright we hear – well play on and thenwe will go back to the transcript.  Alright what you see on the screen once more is the person you have identified as Gavin Watson at the desk you have spoken about, with piles of money on the desk.    Alright continue please.  Alright that then is the end of the video.  Perhaps we can revert to the transcript to explain some of the conversation that took place in relation to yourself, Patrick and other persons mentioned.    No, I want to ask some questions please.    Just for clarity for our sake Chair, the questions that need to be looked at are?    Right, we can then revert please to the transcript S4 atpage 3 at the… Near the bottom of page 3, the following words are attributed to Andries    Right, then Gavin Watson says   Alright.    Why were these amounts given to yourself and Andries van Tonder, senior management?    And you are now complicit.    Thank you Chair.  If you go to Page 3 of the transcript of the video we have just played, again for record purposes, EXHIBIT S4, to the bottom of page 3.  Before we refer to the name mentioned there, may I ask you a question?   Did you know from your own knowledge of payments made to a person with a first name Patrick?    Who were they?    And Patrick Gillingham, who was he at the time?    Right, before you go on, do you know whether or not and from your own knowledge please, whether or not money was paid to Patrick Gillingham?    And you will come to that detail later.    Now ...[intervenes]    Just to clarify in that respect, there would be the stage where Bosasa would bid for the award of a particular tender.  Correct?    There would be occasion on which… And you will give this evidence, Bosasa was involved prior to the issue of the tender documents in going so far as to write up the specifications for the tender.    Inside knowledge.    Once the contract had run its course, it would be extended in two circumstances.  The first where the client or the Government department had discretion to extend and that it would do in its own discretion.  Correct?   And there were occasions when the contract expired and before it could be extended a further tender process would have be gone through.    And you have examples of both in your evidence.    Was influence exercised in respect of both categories of extension?    And that is unlawful influence I am talking about.    Alright, let us go back then to the transcript at page 3.  You say there were two Patricks who would be recipient to your knowledge, of the payment of cash monies as you have described them as grants.    Right, your name is mentioned on page 4 and perhaps we should place on record what is recorded here in the transcript.  At the bottom of    What is 110 denote?    Then over the page on page 4 of EXHIBIT S4, GavinWatson is recorded as saying, “Okay, what is going to happen here?  Brian Biebuyck and Angelo.”  Is that a reference I take it to yourself?    And you have personal knowledge of the circumstances that are being spoken about here.    Well let us just read the transcript first and then you can    Perhaps ...[intervenes]    If I may interject.    Could we just finish.    I am sorry to interrupt.    But, if you wish to proceed with the question, obviously I am ...[intervenes]    Yes, it will all be.    Andries van Tonder says   I am sorry.    No Chair, he would have a complete explanation of what the whole of the discussion ...[intervenes]    Let us then just clarify a few issues.  Prior to the handover of the duty of payments and the duty of handling to Mr Biebuyck on the one hand and Mr van Tonder on the other, what was the practice or what was the arrangement in regard to payments to Patrick Gillingham?    And pay.    Or who would pay?    Are you able to say from this transcript and your recollection of the circumstances that you have described to the Chair, which Patrick is being referred to in this transcript?    Remember you told the Chair that there were twoPatricks who received money from Bosasa.    Are you able to say from your own knowledge, which Patrick is being referred to in this transcript.    Please hand on.    And you would specify such occasions in your evidence to come.    Just to clarify a little detail of the video and the circumstances surrounding the payment of monies to which you have just testified, do you know approximately when this video was taken?    That evidence can be given.    Where were you at the time?    And what is the relevance of your not being employed to the fact that there is a handover here?    Well the duties that you used to perform.    Are according to your evidence in relation to the transcript and the video being handed over to another person to perform those duties.      At the stage this video was taken and at the stage this conversation apparently took place, you were no longer employed by Bosasa.    Is that the reason the handover takes place or is there a another reason that the handover takes place?    Right.  Was there any stage after the termination of your employment that you continued to be involved in the payment of monies?    Is this a convenient time for the long adjournment Chair?    Good afternoon Chair.  I understand that you had an announcement to make. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Good morning Chair thank you.    Thank you Chair.  Chair just to let you know that the payments were also for – for instance hiring of vehicles, travel and that type of thing.  They were not regular in the sense that they were not monthly, but that would happen quite often, I would say every two/three months.    Yes.    Chair those were the amounts when I left Bosasa.    I cannot remember Chair.    I think it is in my affidavit, but I am trying to jog my memory to get the exact date.    Yes.    Thank you Chair.    Correct.    Correct.      Correct.    The only contracts that were awarded to Dyambu at that stage was Libanon and Kloof Mine and the value of them is in the region of approximately R160 million per annum.      Per annum.   No, no, no it was ...[intervenes]    Yes it was for about three years if I recall.      Yes.    If I recall correctly and I stand to correction, because it is a long time ago, it was in 2001 or 2002.  In was in the region of about R14 million per month.  So that would be about R180 million per annum.    I do.    I would like to check, but it would be much more because the first contract was only for OR Tambo, the second contract was for Airports Nationally.     Thank you.     Chair the payment – the value was about also R180 million per annum at that time.    Thank you.      The ACSA contract was initially for the provision of security services and gardening at the Multi-Storey car park.    I did not, but I did ask a person to take the video for me.    Yes.    Correct.    Very well.    Exceptionally well.    Most definitely Chair.    Very well.    Most definitely.    I can Chair.    They were common place.      I am aware of those activities.    Most definitely in detail.    If you could.      I will check.     Excuse me Chair, but my transcript does not have timing on it.      Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Correct.    Yes they are.    Yes.    Chair that is safe inside of the vault of the company'ssecretary's office.      I do.    The writing on the safe was to do with the legal privilege, because we were concerned that we be raided.  There was some documents in there, but there was – mostly that was the holding place for the cash Chair.  So we had there, there you would have to contact Hogan Lovells and Brian B Buck to get access into the safe.    Correct.      Chair I must admit, I put that sticker on the safe personally because – and I had one or two documents in the safe there that were regarding the information that was given to me by Gavin Watson regarding the SLU and the NPA investigation.  So that is one of the reasons why those documents were in that safe as well.    And the NPA investigation, correct.   No Chair.    Correct.    I will do.   PLAYING THE VIDEO    Chair what is shown on the video is a person called Andries van Tonder opening up the safe, the bottom safe, taking out a box of cash.    Yes.    They are inside the vault.    Correct.    Most definitely.   The gentleman was Andries van Tonder he was the ...[intervenes]    The CFO Chair.    Bosasa.    Correct Chair.    Two reasons, because you hear me speaking just now and also because I asked him to take the video.    That is right.    Yes Chair.    It is the same person Mr Chair.     We discussed it, I would not say it was an instruction.    We discussed it.    Yes.    It was quite a heavy box Chair and he is having to carry it by himself.    The cell phone is in his top left hand pocket.     Correct.  The person is the company's secretary Natasha Olivier.      Correct.    Will do.      Andries van Tonder.    The lady that greets him at first is the lady by the name of Shalimar Loo she works in the IT Division.  She is just walking passed him.      Yes.    Andries is walking – he walked out of the reception area and he is now turned left and he is walking passed the Bid Office on the left and he is walking towards Salaries and Wages on the left and he would be turning right through the garden into Consilium's office.      The vault is built behind the main boardroom in the Consilium office.  So the only person that would have had access to the Consilium once a month was Doctor Jurgen Smith and Caroline Grammar who did the wages for Consilium.  But Gavin Watson had a key to get in and out as he wanted to.    The box is being transported from the secretary – the company's secretary's office vault to Gavin Watson's vault.    That is correct.    Correct.    Correct.      That is right Chair.    Correct.    Andries van Tonder there are two doors that needs to go through.  The first door opening it up to the office block, the second door would be going to the vault which was always hidden – all vaults were hidden behind false walls or doors.    Sorry Chair.    Will do.      Sorry Chair I just want to get it clear for you.    1   It is exactly the same notice that I mentioned earlier on the safe that is the vault door.    Correct.    Correct Chair.      Correct Chair.      Correct Chair.   The long olive green, it is actually olive green Chair, it is what we call a "drop safe".  If you look carefully you can actually see it has got a picture in it, which opens up.     Correct.    Next to the photostat paper if you look just underneath it with a yellow strip and a blue strip across it, those are the security bags Chair.      Correct Chair.    The use of those bags is to pack cash to pay people with bribes.      No Chair they were only used for bribes.    Sorry I am not used to this computer.      The gentleman is Mr Gavin Watson.    He is seated on the left hand side of the vault.  He has a table a chair there and behind him is his safes.      He is inside the vault.    Morning – I think he just mentioned, I did not hear properly, I think he said "good morning" or "morning to you".    Yes.    It is used primarily for counting cash.    My apologies.    That is Johannes Gumede.      He is seated at the desk.  There was always a spare Chair there.  There are only two chairs in the vault Chair, he is seated at the one chair at the same desk as Gavin Watson.    I think further on it gets a bit clearer.    Those are very confidential files.    Sorry Chair, some of them would be legitimate documents.  A lot of them would be shareholders' agreements and then the unlawful documents as well.    Sorry I am just trying to ...[intervenes].    Chair the time is 1   Correct.    Correct.    Correct.    I do Chair, it is money in a bag.    A pen and what seems to be a paper or a list.    My apologies Chair.    Yes.  If you look on the table there is a plastic bag and there is money inside there.  There is R100 notes and there is a pile of R100 notes on top of a piece of paper, a pen and what looks to be like a cell phone next to the pad.    Chair, we used to get the money in either 100s or preferably R200 notes.    You can see the difference.    You are 100% right Chair.  That plastic bag is over those notes because those notes come in packed, I think it is R1 million in one big bag,which is wrapped by the people that collect the cash and that type of thing.    Thank you.    If I could just rewind it.  Shift and back?    My apologies Chair.    No leave it, I will do it okay.    If I may make a point?    I think that is a slightly clearer picture of the cash.    And a clearer picture of Mr Joe Gumede.    We are now 1   Yes.    Would you like me to rewind it again?    Okay.    Okay, thank you Chair.    That is Mr Papa Leshabane.    Papa Leshabane, he was the spokesperson, he was also the director for Kgwerano Fleet Management and he sits on the main board.    Kgwerano (spelt).  If I may add Chair, they provide vehicles to Government on the SMS scheme.   Correct.    Correction from my side Chair, those vehicles was a contract that Kgwerano had with the Department of Transport, it was valued at about 14 million, 15 million per month and it was to supply the management of Government, various management on a scheme where we would do all themaintenance of the vehicle over that period.  So it was a contract that was awarded, that is what Kgwerano is.    No.    Correct.    Correct.    Those Chair, are two full bags of cash.    Correct.    Sorry Chair, yes.    Correct Chair.   The reason I conclude that there is money in them Chair, is because number one I know the system, number two the bags were on the safe, number three the case was on the table and number four, it is being carried out.  There is nothing else that you carry out in a bag like that.    Chair if I can elaborate as well.  Number one would be the delivery of the cash.  Number two would be packing and reconciling into the safe.  Number three would be notifying from either director that they are coming to collect cash.  Number four would be to count the cash with the person packing the bag.  Number five would be for the person to take the cash and to go and deliver it.  Number 6 would be the delivery.    Correct.    Okay.    Chair, I can confirm that.    19 Years.    Chair, they are very identifiable.    And they are probably the size of an A4 envelope.    Or bigger on the side.    People might say well is it not a courier bag.    Because you used a courier.  These were specific bags.   That were bought only for that reason.    Chair if – it would assist if I could just chip in when I see something I would appreciate it.    If Adv Pretorius is okay with that.    Okay the sound you are hearing is the typical sound of opening up the box with the cash in it.  It is the tape on the box that is being pulled, the duct tape.    I would just like to stop there.  On the left you will see the drop safe which had the aperture in it.    Correct.    It is the same safe.  On the top of the safe you will see plastic envelopes that I spoke about, the bags, and that is one of the safe doors.  Now normally they would be filled, you know one safe would be filled the other one would be empty that is why there is two safes and the drop safe.  We would have todrop money in the drop safe if Gavin was not there.    Okay.    Alright, I do not see unfortunately, any of my books there although if you look at the bottom, as a matter of fact I do see one of my black books, if you look the bottom Chair, on the bottom ...[intervenes].    [Indistinct 13   You see there is a black book.    With a yellow kind of goldish lining.    That is one of my black books.   Correct.    Yes.    Talking about the shorter one.  If you look at the safe it has got three shelves, the floor, on the floor of that safe you will see a little black book.    Can you see it?   My books are very distinctive, they are black books which I – my family, my kids buy me for Christmas, they buy me the big ones and the small ones.  I do not normally use the small ones for myself.  I think I do have one here I can show you, but that is one of the black books in the safe.    Yes.    The timing on that is 2 minutes and 4 seconds.    Chair, a drop safe ...[intervenes].    The drop safe is a safe that has a small aperture in it and it has got a flap so that you cannot retrieve out of it but you can drop into it.  So often Iwould have to, if Mr Watson was not around, because he was the only one who had a key for the safes, if he was not around I would have to go and drop money into the drop safe and he would then take it out of the drop safe and pack it in the other safes when he was around.  I would always make sure the company secretary had the keys for the safe, for the vault.  I would be able to get into the vault and then place the money in the long drop safe.    My hands are pretty bruised from all the years of dropping money in the drop safe Chair.  Because I do not know if you recall there was atelevision programme Open All Times, with a British programme, with a till that they battled to close, they would always catch their fingers and that was the anecdote.    Yes.    Chair, we cover the cash later on, I cover it in my affidavit but I can tell you that initially in the early, early years yes, cash was drawn from the banks but then it just got too much and too much and it would come from cross border, it would come from, I believe from Zimbabwe from sales from someone else and some would come from betting houses.    Can I continue?    That is correct.    That was at 02   He is carrying what looks like is money.    I can.    Yes I am.    That is right yes.    That is 02   If you give me a second I will tell you how much more or less it would be.  That is 50, that is R100 000.    Chair because I used to ...[intervenes].    It was part of my job.  In the one hand you will see there is three elastic bands, small elastic bands there then there is one, two, three [indistinct    Yes.    Chair, I just want to mention I cannot see the time on those screens but I can see the time on this screen so I might miss it and then – but I will then go back.    Thank you, alright.    Correct, the language is English, Joe Gumede is basicallyspeaking to Gavin Watson and Papa Leshabane is on his cell phone speaking either Xhosa or Tswana.    Correct.    Chairperson we have got four people in the room.    There was Andries van Tonder.    There was Joe Gumede.    There was Gavin Watson.    And Papa Leshabane.    Chair if I can respond to that, there was a list which I was responsible at the time.  There was also a list that Gavin Watson was responsible for.  He would do mostly the senior staff, where he would give them bonuses in cash every month and there were some that I would do, and Mr Watson would obviously do cash as well but the main, the bigger cash amounts would all be done by Mr Watson.   Chair if I can interrupt here, I do not want to make a point of anything but I think it is important we watch now because Papa Leshabane now leaves the vault with the bags.    I said I did not want to interrupt but I just want to mention now that you will see Papa Leshabane leaves the vault with the bags.    I will Chair.    Can I proceed?    Correct Chair.    Correct.    Chair, I am willing to say that extremely positively and to bet all the money that is in the safe on it as well.    Thank you.    Johannes Gumede is asking for an extra R10 000.    I just want to mention there, there you can actually see thebags and you can see that they have been packed pretty full.  So ...[intervenes].    Correct.    Johannes Gumede.    Clearly, we – Chair if I can add myself and Johannes Gumede had a very close relationship.  We went on holidays together.  We went to Italy together.  His kid came with us on driving expeditions.  We werevery, very close.    Yes I do.    Chair, the arm is that of Johannes Gumede.    The arm of the person in this position is Johannes Gumede and the person behind Johannes Gumede is Papa Leshabane leaving the safe.    At the bottom of the screen I see two moneybags full.    No Chair, if you look, if you count the shelves down, one down.    There are three shelves.    And you look slightly across you will see a grey bag, there is two grey bags together and there is some writing on the grey bags.    Yes.    Mr Gumede is in the front.    Behind him is Mr Leshabane.    If I can rewind it by a few seconds.    I will show you.    Chair the uniform was a blue shirt with a tie.  It is all blue shirts.  We wore uniforms as a company.  I wear my blue shirt, I can show you.    That is French blue.    Yes.    I will wear one tomorrow if you would like me to.    That is correct Chair.    Will do Chair.    Johannes Gumede is speaking.    Chair can I – sorry could you repeat that for me please?    Thank you very much Chair, thank you Adv Pretorius.  Chair, I just need to relate something that happened and I did not want to say anything until everything had been verified.    As you know I have been receiving numerous threats and that type of thing.  About four years ago I employed a gentleman from the SAPS, he was in the special team of the SAPS I was told, his name was either Captain or Colonel Solomon Segale.   He left the police force and he joined Bosasa and we used him in security.  I did not deal too much with him because he reported to one of the directors Johannes Gumede directly, and to Gavin Watson directly.  He subsequently was made a director of one of the companies.  I was a bit concerned yesterday but I was not sure of my facts.    That he – when I went for the lunch break he was standing outside with a group of policemen.  They were in uniform, he was not.    I then asked to verify.    Because I did not just want to make an allegation.    He was most definitely here.   And to me it is concerning.    That they report to me as well that he did not go through the normal accreditation.    And he slipped in on his old police ID card.    So that is concerning.    Thank you Chair.    I will put it up on the board.  It is 02   Yes Chair I have checked but if I may just add when I mentioned earlier, it just came to my memory now, when I mentioned earlier the grey bags for cash, the grey bags were only used for cash, sometimes there were certain people in the staff, which I mention later on in my affidavit, which get cash as well, those we put also into grey bags just so that you are aware of it.    Sorry Chair what I am trying to say is that I was not 100% correct when I said to you grey bags only get used for bribes.    Grey bags are used to pack – we used to give certain staff members that had to keep quiet about the cash, we used to give them an amount of , R20 000 each.  Later in the video you will actually hear it, and we used to put their money in grey bags as well.  Just for clarity purposes.    Yes.    Yes it was.    Correct, I just wanted to make that clear because I am still under oath.    So I just wanted to make that clear.    I fully accept that judge.    Oh sorry Chair.    My wife has reminded me a few times as well.    The use of cash was from the safe, was usedpredominantly for illegal activities.    Correspondence.    Was used to pack the cash in that was used for bribes.    Internally and externally.    Yes.    Why not just put it on our payroll?    Sorry what I can add to that ...[intervenes].    If I can add to that Chair?    We used to pay 15% premium to get the cash because the cash was laundered.    So if you wanted to pay bonuses it would be better, saferand more cost effective to do it via the payroll system.    When I was referring to bonuses I should have used the word bribe.    Because what we are actually doing is we are bribing the people to keep quiet about the corruption.    Correct, some of the words used are, and they stuck in my mind after 19 years.    Chair what I was trying to distinguish was that these are not courier bags.    There is courier bags that are used to courier and strangely enough they are also grey but they are not the same.  They are much bigger and much thinner.  You can actually distinctly see them.  It is a pity that I cannot get a bag to show you and you can see the difference.    Correct.    Correct.    I stand by that.    Chair the grey bags.    What I meant and what I think I said was that the bags would be used for bribe money.  I was confused when I said that the staff that get bonuses also get them in the grey bags.  You clarified it for me very nicely to say was it lawful or illegal.    And that cleared it up for me.    That those brown, those grey bags are only used for bribes.    Yes.   Correct.    Correct.    That is correct.    Correct, can I press play?   If I could just make it a bit louder, I do not think the voice is coming through, or could I put this ...[intervenes].    Perhaps here.    Oh okay.    Alright.   Basically what was said is I need R10 000 to buy two remotes for ACSA because they have got cargo gates and he wants panic buttons, the remotes for panic buttons that will ring into the police control room.    Yes.    It does not make sense because Chair, we have got an internal – not we have got, sorry they have got an internal fully fledged technology department that makes up remotes, gates and panic buttons and that type of thing, so I do not understand why they would buy two remotes, and I cannot understand why they would have a remote in the police offices as he says, it does not make sense to me at all.    It could very well be.    What would happen is that the unit leader, who is an operational person not a chairman of the company, would request on an order, a purchase order.  He would have to write a motivation.  When I was there he would have to write me a motivation, attach a purchase order, three quotations and then I would then refer that to Sondolo IT at that time, and I would use a specific person to go out and see what the need was and to put in the proper system, especially if you are talking about cargo gates at the airport.  I mean that is a serious place, and if you remember we had a raid at one of the cargo gates.  You would follow proper processes to do it.    Most definitely.   Well just to give you an indication you can buy a remote transmitter and a receiver at Builders Warehouse, and you can buy it for about R300.  So both would have maximum cost you R600 and if you put long life batteries in there probably about R700 in total maximum.    Chairman.    That is what is so strange about it Chair, is that normally he would just pick up the phone and phone and say I would like a system in and it would be done, and the other people would following the right processes.    I cannot understand it either.  I am sorry, I cannot answer that question.  I am not ...    I just want to mention that there is no – I cannot view thetime here anymore so I will try and count it out.    Where would you like me to stop?    Sorry Mr Chair, it does not show the time, it shows the last time of the last ...[intervenes].    No that is 2   I would just like to see, it records the last time, it does not give the actual time.    Can I make this suggestion Chair?    That I show – that I – you tell me at the scene, to stop at the scene.    The person that leaves the vault is Mr Johannes Gumede, the chairman of Bosasa or African Global.  Could I just rewind it just a little bit please Chair?    I would like to show you something.    That is – well now you see Joe Gumede leaving the vault.    Chair sorry I do not want to speculate.  There is a spot there but I cannot speculate.    No, am going to try and see now.   Yes, you tell me where to stop.    Yes.    It is money bags.    Empty ones.  If you have a look at the bottom to the left of his hand you will see the book that I spoke about earlier.    Yes.    Will do.  Sorry just for indication purposes his initials Gavin Watson, are on his shirt, on his cuff.    Chair, there you can clearly see the black book at the bottom.    Can I rewind and play.    I am going forward.    Correct, but then you will not hear the transcripts.    Perhaps we should just play it and then …[Intervenes].    Will do Chair.    Correct.  It will be stuck on here for quite some time because at this stage, I think they are busy packing.    Nothing Chair.    There are 24 frames normally in a second, so I am having to click it 24 times in one second.    So it does take a while.  Sorry, there is nothing else I can do.  This is where all the talking takes place.    Ja.    [Indistinct].    Sorry.    Will do. VIDEO PLAYING    Excuse me Chair, you can hear Gavin is busy making up thenotes, so Joe Gumede says he is coming back and he [indistinct] – Sorry that would have been the list that he would come back, because you can see the safe was empty, so they needed to refill and Joe says, ‘I am coming back.’    Sorry, Andries van Tonder is counting.  He is a very nervous type person, so he knows what he is doing is wrong, and he is trying to count it.      He is making mistakes.    Sorry it was a frequent reference by Mr Watson because it was – Cash was noting in the company.  It was just money.  It was paper.  There was not regard ...[intervenes]    By Mr Watson.    The monopoly he referred to ...[intervenes]    I once asked him what is the meaning – Monopoly money    Okay.    Correct.    Can I continue?    No.    Okay, if I can explain, when you handle large amounts of cash like that, you have them in, as I said earlier, they wrap 50/50.  So one bundle is 100, what they were actually doing was counting 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 but what he said was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, so the rule was you packing 500s, 500 gives you 1 million.    500 thousand.  So, if you hear the knocking on the table, that is a pack of a hundred being put down.    And if you count the knocks as well.    If there were… No, there were five stacks of a hundred.  There was two X five, gives you a million.  That is exactly what I meant.    Correct.    Sorry it is imprinted in my mind.    I will do.    That is a million rand exactly and I explained how it was packed.  So that is a million rand.    Yes.    It is a million.    If I can explain how do I calculate it.    Okay.  The mouse does not work on the screen hey.  Can you see the mouse?    Oh great.  If you have a look at that, that is 50.  So 50/50.    Is a hundred.  The two 50s there.  As I said, we always put them together, so it will make it 100, so on the top there you have got 200, so it 2.  Thiswas a full pack this 100 that there is 200 thousand.  That is 50 there is a hundred and that there in total is 200 thousand.    So that is 2, 4, 6 and I can see up to 8.  I do not know where they packed the other 200 but that is how you can calculate it.    Just roughly.  I think just from years and years of doing it, you just glance at this kind money and it is easy to count.  It is not much in the bigger scheme of normal deliveries.    Correct.    I think it is coming just after this.  Yes.  It is exactly the same Chair.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    Chair, the only person ...[intervenes].    Chair no, the money there was only for bribed.  Mr Watson, obviously it was his company alone, he was a shareholder, he could probably takemoney and ...[intervenes].    Use it for whatever he wants to.    But we had a petty cash office.    And that would be used to draw money.    So that we have records.    I just want to add for clarity remember this money could not be claimed back as an expense.    Once you had used it.    That is why it would not be used for normal purchases.    Correct.    Correct.    Into the safe or into the vault?    The keys for the actual safes were held by Gavin Watson and him alone.    Hundred percent correct.    If I can just expand, that is why there was a drop safe.    Because if there – because sometimes there was too muchmoney.    To fit into the normal safe.    And in the secretary's vault.    You know R5 million in 100 or R200 notes is a lot of money.    You would have to then transfer half or take some and just get it into the safe.    Chairman there are other safes where money was kept.  Whether it was, if it was used again in the system but in total there are about eightvaults at Bosasa and sometimes money was kept in other vaults as well.  When I was responsible to take over the security of it, I only used two vaults as a safety measure, and not the other vaults.    The company secretary's vault.    That safe, the secretary's safe was to move money after ithad been delivered, to hold it there until such time as Mr Watson was there to put the other money in the safe as long as we did not have to urgently drop it or anything like that.  As a matter of fact it was called the oven.  Mr Seopela gave it a very nice name, he said it was the oven and the bread must cool down.  In other words the bread must get cold and then it will be moved out into the shop to distribute.    Chair, I do know the answer and – but I do not want to speculate.  I can actually go into one of the records if you do not mind.    During the break.    And come back and then refer you to it if Adv Pretorius is okay with that.    Then I will give you accurate numbers and closing balances of what was in the safe.    Yes.    [Indistinct] million yes.    I do know factually what was spoken about and basically what happened was there was no time to check money in the open on the street.  Itwas a very dangerous process.    Cash coming in.    So what would have to happen would be somebody would have to meet up with the supplier of the cash on the side of the road, normally it was at Lanseria, there is a petrol station there, they would meet up and the box of money would be transferred from a nondescript car into say for instance in this case Andries' car.  There was no time to count it on the side of the road.  So what would happen is it would then be delivered to the office where it would be counted in thesecretary's vault.  From the secretary's vault, if you have a look at those, previously you saw those boxes in the vault, those are file holders but we would count in there.  We would pack them and stack them in there, count it and then repack it into the box, duct tape over the box, then write the amount.  Then you would be able to verify.  Then the person who delivered would be phoned and said listen you were R6 000 short on your previous delivery and they will be expected to fix it the following delivery.  I think we go in later on how this whole process and a cash deal collection went and that will explain it more in depth.    Correct.    The person who would deliver the money to a central point would be an outsider to Bosasa.  The person collecting it would be normally Andries van Tonder.    I did occasionally collect, but very seldom collect money as well.   Those are the security bags.  If you have a look here you see there is a yellow strip there, and you see there is a yellow strip, so it is a double seal that you put, you fold over but those are the actual security bags.  They are about the size of an A4, a bit bigger than an A4 piece of paper.    But they do fit quite a bit in.    You will hear he asks "how much is Patrick".    Yes that is right.    Sure, that is 150, 300, 450, sorry let me just check here.  That there is 900 000.    Would you like me to continue?    The intervals are weekly.  So what would happen is on a Monday Gregg Lacon-Allin would send a message what is the order of chicken for today.  So we would then say well we need to check with Gavin, and we check with Gavin and then let him know what the order would be but on average it was weekly that will be filled up, sometimes more frequently.  Sometimes we would change it and we would take a bulk order in of between five and six or sometimes overChristmas period it would even be more.    Chair, if I may, I can give you the answer in a matter of 30 seconds.  If I may just flip Annexures.    And if you could maybe guide me on which Annexure it is.   As it pleases you.    Ja.    Yes.    If I may ask you Chair, you also want to know how many people that actually benefited [Intervenes].    From it.    Yes, it would have been a short delivery.    There were certain words that was synonymous with thing and ‘stuff’ is money.  Here is your money, here is your stuff.  Every month, for instance, I would get my stuff, which was cash money that I was given that I could use to do anything I wanted to.  It was not reflected in the books.   That was what was given to me or to Andries ...[intervenes]    Just keep you happy.    Because it kind of buys loyalty.  You feel important.  Youcaught up in a cult.    That is right.    Ja.    You see, if I may elaborate.    It is a trap, like bribery is a trap, because you raise your standard of living when you get it and that is the whole monopoly idea of this monopoly money is that you raise your standard of living.  You raise everything to that bar and then as soon as you start complaining about it, it is taken away.    Chair quite simply you are one hundred percent correct.  It is why we are in the situation we are in this country today.   Chair, you are hundred percent correct and that is why we had to use that system, because you do not entrap somebody for life when you pay them a once off, because they take their money and they go and they start and they do something else, but once you start paying people and I have realised that myself.  The hard law, the hard way.  Once you start paying people bribes on a monthly basis, for as long as that they are they, you control them one hundred percent.    Yes.    Chair, you have hit the nail on the head.  It is so true and there are plenty people affected.    Yes.    There were two Patricks.  Yes I am aware of them.    One is Patrick Litler who was an operational leader.  The other one was Patrick Gillingham.    Patrick Gillingham at the time when this all started was the CFO of the Department of Correctional Services.    Most definitely money was paid to Patrick Gillingham.  I was involved.   If need be.  Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.    Chair, what I can tell you, I cannot count all the contracts in the back of my head now, but what I can tell you is it was every single contract.    Either way, every single contract was tainted with bribes and corruption.    I would say that most extensions were largely affected… I would really have to sit down and work it out, exactly.    Correct.    Most definitely.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Correct.    Correct.    Correct Chair.    Correct.    In most cases yes.  There were perhaps one or two exceptions.   Most definitely.    Correct.    That is correct.    R110 000.    That refers to Brian Biebuyck the Attorney and Angelo Agrizzi being me.    I can tell you about them Chair.    If I can give you context.  A context is ...[intervenes]    Chair, I think that the Transcriber maybe does not… Did not recognise the voices, but basically what it said is, it is said… It says in the transcript here, “Sir, so if you pay me every month, we changed the agreed agreement.  Brian willhandle him every month and you can pay him every month.”  So Brian Biebuyck and myself would have to go and do a handover.  I had objected.  Once more, I had been put under an agreement which said I would be paid X every month, but I have to handle Patrick Gillingham is one of them and I helped him with his divorce and everything and so with his kids and that, so I would have to handle him, but then Andries would pay him.    But I had said, I do not want part of any of this anymore.  I was already outside the company.    You have hit the nail on the head again Chair.  What you said, ‘manage him’ so that he does not become like I did, a loose cannon in the opinion of Watson.    Yes.    Most of them would be managed by the person that pays them.  This was a unique situation.  It was a very sensitive situation and that is why Brian Biebuyck was co-opted into handle him and Andries was co-opted into paying him, so I do not know why they decided on Brian Biebuyck or Andries to pay him, but it was to control the process.    I believe he was… He was an attorney.  I am not… I cannot ...[intervenes]    I would handle them Chair.   And pay.    I would handle him and I would pay him.    I do not seem… Which… Where you referring to in the transcript.    Yes.  This is Patrick Gillingham.    This is Patrick Gillingham and I can explain why Chair ...[intervenes]    Okay, because the other Patrick used to get the money for the Unions at Kloof, Libanon and Leeudoring and he used to get the money for the hostel manager that used to be paid as well.   So he would get a different set of money to this.  This was a full R110 000 that was packaged specifically for Patrick Gillingham, over and above his other salary.    No.   Correct.    Sorry and if I can also just clarify and add, because if he just said Patrick and 110, there could have still been maybe the same or different Patrick, but the fact that he says that Angelo and Brian…  There has been a new agreement.  Angelo and Brian Biebuyck will handover and meaning that I would handover and you will go and pay me future on a monthly basis.    Chair, it is normally the responsibility of the person that ordered… In other words that said, I need to pay somebody to take that cash, so whoever I handed it to, they would confirm it to me.  I would do a few checks now and again, but I would say they would not, not hand it to the person, because it would come out eventually, if you do not.    Yes I will.    This video was taken in 2017.  I am sure the investigators,when they did the voracity check, actually looked at that video, if I am not mistaken.    Yes.    I was at my office in… Where I was working.  Not at Bosasa.  I had left Bosasa.    I remember having… Sorry I want to answer this properly.  Sorry Chair, can the question be repeated?    Yes.    Yes.   Correct.     I was handling it to a point and then I did not want to deal with them anymore and that is why the handover took place.    No.   I can give it.  It will take a while, but I would most definitely give it to you now if you do not mind.    So basically what would happen is people would be disposed of.  If you got to know too much, people would just get disposed of.  I know, because I used to do some of the disposing.      Well there was a dustbin for people.    There is a dustbin with people’s names on it.  So basically ifyou had served your purpose and you started raising your voice and you started saying, but I do not want to do this anymore, you would be easily terminated.  Just say, we do not need that person anymore and we lived in an environment where it was very dangerous.  They had a history would be… I for instance was shown… I was called to a meeting at the Michael Angelo once and Mr Watson was sitting with a gentleman by the name Killer Ximba and ...[intervenes]    X I M B A    And I had never met him before.  I had heard of him and I wascalled by Gavin Watson and I remember it vividly.  They were sitting with a fish…  Where the fish pond is on the restaurant level and said, come look at this.  And the guy opened up a bag and showed me a big… I do not know what kind… I do not own a gun, I have never used a gun, so I would not know, but I was… When I explained it afterwards, it was a 45 Colt with a white handle and all chrome and he showed it to me.  So, you know what would happen is, if you did not do what was told to you, where you questioned it, you became a problem and problems would have to leave.  They would have their salaries cut.  We were constantly told that we were white males and that you will not find a job anywhere out there and I have got videos of conference where we were stood up and we were told, you are a white male.  You will not find a job anywhere.  This was drummed into our heads so as soon as we stopped doing what we told to do, the wrath of everything would come down on us and the biggest problem is that the blame would be attributed to those who had left.  So when I left, a lot of blame was attributed to me.  That I was involved.  I was the one who paid people.  I was the one… It was under my instruction.  So, Mr Andries van Tonder phoned me up one dayand he was very concerned, because it was a process that you could see unfolding.  You would pick it up.  First you would get moved.  Your office gets moved.  You get ignored and then the next thing is, you get fired and you do not have the financial resources to go and fight in the legal cases and that and the one thing that you must bear in mind that Gavin Watson would never sign anything.  He would tell you, I never have signed anything.  You cannot pin anything on me and he would then sell you up and that is what motivated the video.    Had I come to the Commission Chair without solid evidence toshow you, it would all have been pinned on me alone.    I do not think Chair that is correct.      I wanted to show you where corruption… And I wanted to tell the country how easy it is to fall into this trap.    Correct.
