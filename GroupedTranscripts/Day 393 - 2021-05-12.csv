CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?  Good morning Dr. Dintwe.    Thank you.    They sometimes complain – witnessessometimes complain about that chair – the seat.  But the problem is that the other one is – seems further from the mic.  But try and just make yourself comfortable.      Ja it is.  Please just administer the oath or affirmation again.    Thank you.  You may be seated.    That is fine.    So – so we would – so we will get that information.    Okay.  But how rife is this problem of appointments that are done in this way particularly those that seem to have features of nepotism roughly do have some idea?  Are we talking about two, three okay in instances are we in a year are we talking about over the past five years fifty people more or less.  Do you have someidea or is that difficult to say?    Forty.    Yes, yes.    Is that so.   Yes.    Yes.    Do you have an idea as to whether there is a number that they seek – or a target that they seek to achieve per year that they must have got X number of people that will go into this training and then later on get employed by SSA?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.   Because it would be good to have an idea whether one can say over the past five years or even more it looks like on average per year so many people get put into the program even if to the training with a view to later being employed by SSA – even if not all of them are people who have been employed due to nepotism but people go into that program to see its size.   No, no that is fine.    It can be furnished later in writing if – if it is information that you can get.    It is not (talking over one another).    Okay.  Mr Pretorius.    So – so are you saying that there is no legislation or regulation that gives power to anybodywhether it is Minister or DG to say this can be done?    The – the legislative provisions that you have in mind about the advertising and so on I think those would relate to the actual appointment of these people.  Is it not?    Yes.  What I was more concerned about ishow they come in because based on your evidence it is like they first have to get into some training or they get bursaries on the basis that once you have got whatever the qualification or training is you will be employed.  So I was asking about any legislative provisions relating to the granting of those bursaries or whatever the program is.  Do you know anything?    Okay.    Oh.    Okay, okay.    Oh you had exhausted the earlier one.    Oh okay.  But the cadets get bursaries to get some training or whatever and then they get employed afterwards, is that right?    Ja.  So – okay that is where I was still on – and you say that one has got no legislative provisions – framework as far as you know?    Yes.    Yes.    They do not have?    Yes.  So it is like somebody just decides it is a good thing to look around and give bursaries sometimes to people who seem to be deserving and then it is done.   Yes.  Okay but the latter category you were talking about is people who have been in the system but not in certain positions and then they are promoted to certain positions without following any processes.    Okay.    Ja there are…    Yes.    Yes.  Yes. And in regard to that both Ministers and DG’s are involved as well in the breach of those regulations?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.DR DINTWE   And that is about how many people?    26.    And which Minister are we talking about do you know?  Yes and how recent is that that appointment are – or how recent are they?    So it is something that happened afterthis commission had heard some evidence about some of the challenges in SSA.    Yes.    Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius.  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  Have you got any understanding with regard to this category – have you got any understanding why Ministers and DG’s would act in breach of the regulations in regard to these appointments whenthey know them. Do you know why they would be doing this?    Ja. Okay.  Alright.    Okay.    Okay.  Because the – it cannot be that they do not know I would imagine.  They must be – know the regulations.  You do not want to say anything.    Okay.  Mr Pretorius.     Promotion.     H’m.     Who is quick to work out how much that is in – is it multiplied by eight or ten?  To turn it into – convert it Euros.     Oh, okay.     I have not travelled in a long time. [laughs]     It is roughly?     Millions.     Ja.     H’m.     H’m.  And there is no proof of what itwas used for?     H’m.     So it is a tap that must be closed without jeopardising the effectiveness of intelligence, proper intelligence and the use of cash legitimately for intelligence purpose but close the tap for those who can just take money and they do not have to account to anybody as to whether that money was used properly.     No, no I ...[intervenes]      ...the legitimate part of using cash, that must continue.  The problem is to close the tap of using it illegitimately.     Ja.  Because one can understand why cash may have to be used for legitimate intelligence purposes but one must close the tap if one can in regard topeople being able to just take money and go and use it for whatever they choose to use it for and say it was for intelligence purposes and their word must be accepted.     Ja.     I thought you were tempted to say I can say without fear of contradiction that they are not doing their job.  [laughs]       Ja.     H’m.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Now with regard to this particular committee.  Are you basing your view on your experience during your term of office only or are you only basing your view on records or lack of records that you found in youroffice as to interactions between your predecessors and this particular committee or what is the position?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that is a long time.    Ja.  By the way, who was your predecessor?     Oh, she is late?     So she would have been there, from what?  Around 2010?  Is it a five year term?     Ja.     Then there was the space of two years when there was nobody.     Before your time.  Before you were appointed.     Yes.    Yes, yes.     Yes, yes.  Now if – I am trying to find outhow one can find out even without asking the committee, find out as to what may have been sent to the Portfolio Committee by, for example, Ms Radebe and what responses, if any, she may have received in response to her reports.  What did you call them?  What do you call your reports?       Certificates in regard to her certificates.  So in your office, you would have copies of certificates that she would have sent during her time.  Is that right?    But in terms of the mechanisms, you do not have a way of knowing whether the committee acting upon each certificate, do you?     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes, yes.     H’m.     Yes.     Well, I think this is how we can deal with it and maybe you deal with it in your affidavit.  Maybe we have dealt with it last time.  Mr Pretorius will remember.  Or maybe it is still to come amongst the documents that you will send.  I think it would be good if you were able tosay I have looked at the certificates that were sent by my predecessor from that year up to that year.  I am aware of what she recommended or whatever.  What issues she raised before the committee to look at or deal with as well as the ministers, the relevant minister because you have said that the certificates go to the relevant ministers, the relevant DG and the committee.  You – so if you could identify those for each year and be able to say the following – the problem – this problem that was raised during that year is still there or when I arrivedit was still there.  So I can tell that nothing has been done to deal with it properly.  So or whatever had been done has not worked.  You know.  And so I think that could help just to give that indication.  In terms of law, there is nothing that requires the committee or the relevant ministers and DG’s to revert to your office to say you raise these issues.  This is how – this is what I have done in response.       Yes.     You can do that, ja.     Ja.     Ja, ja.     Yes, yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, yes.  Well, of course, I think you suggested the last time or you do in your statement that I think you wish for a regime in terms of which yourrecommendations cannot just be ignored but they would be binding.  I got the impression you had in mind the same situation as the Public Protector but I may be misrepresenting what you say but certainly the minimum, it would seem, is that those authorities when your office has raised issues and made recommendation they should at least come back and say we have noted, we agree and this is what we will do or we do not agree because of the following reasons, so you can take it from there but to have a situation where they just completely ignored youand you never -  you are not – you never know whether they did anything seems untenable.     Yes.    Ignored, ja.     Okay.  Mr Pretorius?     And this would have been in a period of about how many years?  Do you have that information?     Accumulated to R9 million within three years?     Okay.     Not millions.     Not millions.     Ja.     We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay, let us continue.     So it is like different people may have taken monies to finance different factions.     But I think Mr Pretorius is suggesting that in the light of what appears to be large scale abuse ofmonies that should be used legitimately for Intelligence the tightening should not be or cannot be for just a little bit, much more is required.  I think [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     Ja.     Okay, alright.     But somehow it seems that even though different members of that committee may be aware including members of opposition parties serving on that committee, may be aware of the problem, it looks like they cannot get action to be taken by the committee because, from what you have said, it looks like no action seems to have been evident or seems to be taken that is effective. At least, if anything has been done, it seems not to have been effective but you cannot tell what it is that may have been done.     Yes, yes.  And one does not know whether it might be the same problem that has been experienced by some portfolio committees in parliament in regard to oversight where members of opposition parties say we can push as far as we can if the ANC and members of the party who are in the majority do not agree, wecannot do anything because a decision must be by majority.  So one does not know whether that is the situation with this committee as well.     Ja, ja.  No, no, that is fine.  Thank you, let us continue.     Would you be able to say whether because of the redaction, the redactions that you made, there would be nothing wrong with those reports.  Now Icannot remember whether they are classified or not, your certificates, being available to the Commission if those redactions have been made or they will still be a problem even if there are redactions?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Yes, yes, well I would be very interested in seeing those certificates, those report insofar as onecan look at them without any problems in terms of security and so on.     Yes, okay.     Ja, okay.     Ja, okay.  No, that is fine.     Ja, no, no, that is fine.  I think it would be important in order to get the full picture.  Whatever can be dealt with publicly without being in breach of any law, it would be good to look at that.  Whatever I can look at away from the public, that might also be important if it can be done.     Ja, okay.    Ja, ja.  Okay, alright.     Let me also just make sure I understand it.  So you have somebody such as a CFO who, in terms of his authority and job description, is not supposed to have a source.     And a source here is an operative, is that right or it can be…    Ja, okay.     Who gives information.     Hey?     Yes, okay.     Ja.  Yes, it is somebody who gives information required by the organisation.     Okay, alright.  And there could be different categories but that is the general.     So if I, as CFO, want some cash, maybe from time to time I could just have somebody that I connect with, a subordinate of mine who, in terms of the law, is entitled to have a source.     And then I give the money to my subordinate to give to the source and then I get it in someother way or no money gets given to the source physically but the records are written in such a way as if my subordinate gave money to a source.     Yes.     Yes, yes.     Oh.    A source.     Yes.    Is for a source, okay.     To the CFO.     Oh, okay, so …[intervenes]     Oh, so suddenly the CFO must give to the source.     But would the – would both of them know – I guess the CFO knows the subordinate would know what is going on, that this is criminal?     The subordinate also knows.     Ja, ja.     Yes.     Yes, yes, okay.     So  - but the subordinate also knows that what the CFO is doing is criminal because he knows that it is not part of the CFO’s job to be paying sources or is there no such – or is that not the position?     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Well, I guess the bottom line is the law does not allow the CFO to be taking money to a source because if the law allowed that, the CFO, if he was acting lawfully, would go to the accounts department himself.    Yes.  The reason why he must use the subordinate is because he is not allowed to go there and claim money from the accounts department for purposes of giving to a source.     Ja.     But the classification of the law, you know, the classification of such a document cannot be legitimate.  I mean, if you do that, how do you expect thatpeople will benefit from the principle that you cannot use classification to hide criminality?     I mean, you just have to say it to realisehow absurd it is.     Which means they pocket the money.     But on the records – the records will say the money was used to buy such-and-such an equipment or something like that but the equipment would not be there.    I'm sorry.  A group of what?     Backpackers?     Okay.      Because they ...[indistinct].     Well, I'll ask the question.  You know what you would have said to the committee.  You cannot tell us what the committee said, but what you can tell us is whether subsequently there was anything you learnt there which indicates that the committee has done somethingabout it.     Okay.  I am trying to deal with the problem that you cannot tell us what the committee says,but you can tell us if indications are that something has been done.     In terms of what you have observed since then.     Ja.     Ja.  Ja.     Ja.     Factions.    H’m.       So again, it's just theft.      Ja.     Ja, no that is fine.     Is the position that - I am just quickly having a look at those paragraphs, is the position that in regard to each service that falls under your jurisdiction, you have provided certificates for the same period, in terms of years, financial years?     Okay.     Well, maybe – I may be taking you back Dr Dintwe but you mentioned under the failure of oversightover the Intelligence Services, that you include your own office, that it also failed and then you said you could give reasons you were weakened and so on.  It may be that you dealt with it earlier on but I have forgotten, can you just tell me, this is why the reasons why you say your office failed?     Yes.     Yes.     Okay, no, no, I am glad you say that because, you know, with these problems that the Commission is looking at to face the country, we will not solve them until - unless people who are leaders areprepared to look at themselves, look at their own roles and say, I know, I accept that from my side I did not do enough here and going forward, this is what I am committed to doing to make sure that yesterday or tomorrow is not the same as yesterday, you know.  If we are not prepared to do that, and if leaders are not prepared to do that people who are in positions are not prepared to do that there is not going to be a change. So I am always glad when a leader, somebody in charge does not just look at what others have done wrong, but alsosays, have I done enough on my side and what can I do differently going forward?  So I am happy that you have said that.     No, thank you.     Ja, no, no, that that is fine.  I mean, the - one has got to look at what each body or functionary is required to do by law and did they do what they are required to do by law or what they were empowered to do but did not do.  So you look at the committee and say what is there role, what were they employed to do, what were they apply to do, what is it that they did, and what is it that they could have done and you look at there the DG’s as well, if they should have pursued certain issues with DG’s and they didnot then they have valid reasons for not pursuing those issues, those are the types of issues, questions that one looks at.     I see it is 1 o'clock.  Do you have an idea how much more time you need because if for example, you were to be done in 30 minutes, maybe we could delay taking lunch and then take lunch after you are finished but if it is going to be longer then we maybe could take lunch?      Okay, no that is fine let us take the lunch adjournment then we will resume at two.     No that is fine, so then 3 o’clock would be - they could be here.  Okay, we take the lunch adjournment, we adjourn.  INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES      Okay let us continue.    Yes.    Oh okay.   Just that – okay no that is fine.    So…    Yes.    So that is a submission you say.  Is that the submission to the Minister?   That is the actual – the approval of the appointment.    Oh okay.  Okay.    Of the 26 managers.    Yes.   Yes.    Ja.  Ja.    The actual appointment is made by what –by – by who – by the DG but the – he must get the approval of the Minister or is it the Minister who makes the appointment?    Okay.    Ja.  Ja    Recommended.    Yes.  So you say in regard to these 26 managers the acting DG did not recommend – did not sign – he had some issues?    Ja.    Ja.    Abstain – to abstain.  Ja.    Ja it is like spoiling your – your ballot.     He spoilt his ballot.  Okay but the – the Minister then approved but it means if I understand you correctly in approving the Minister is appointing.    Yes.    Okay alright.    Mr Pretorius.  So you do not know what the response was to the budget controller’s consent.    Oh.    Yes.  Yes.  But I would have thought that the appointing authority before he or she appoints would need to satisfy themselves whether there is budget for these posts.   Yes.    Oh alright.  Mr Pretorius.    Well you told me last time that you are not a lawyer but constructive refusal seems also consistent with a judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeal that Mr Pretorius will probably remember where the Supreme Court of Appeal says well if a judge has given a judgment and the party who lost applies for leave to appeal and that application for leaveto appeal is not adjudicated for a long time it is constructive refusal of leave to appeal. So – so it has not been decided the Judge has not decided that he is refusing leave but because it is left hanging for too long it is constructive refusal of leave to appeal.    Oh that is good.   Oh no that is good – so good.    Ja well I have every reason to believe you are going to pass and pass well.   One day.    But also does it mean there seems to be aculture that ah this is small why – why are you bothering about it somebody else has taken much more.  Is that part of the – of what you are saying that there is that culture with the junior members or not?    Okay.    Ja.    So quickly.   Ja.    Okay.    So knowledge of curtains that were bought is a threat to National Security.   To a particular house.    But not the actual purchase of curtains.    Ja.     Ja.     H’m?     Thank you very much, Dr Dintwe, for availing yourself to assist the Commission, we appreciate it very much.  Thank you very much, you will ensure that yougive us what you may give us lawfully.  Okay, thank you very much, you are now excused.  We are going to adjourn for about ten minutes to enable the next work stream to set up but we will continue on Friday with witnesses connected with SSA.     Yes, thank you, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Good afternoon Mr Myburgh, goodafternoon everybody.     Are we ready?     Okay, Mr Gama the oath you took yesterday will continue to apply today.     Thank you, okay, Mr Myburgh.     Hang on one second Mr Myburgh.  Do you still have that memo or the response that you gave to Fundudzi because…[intervene]     H’m.     But okay, but no, I raised it because on the face of it to I also like Mr Myburgh think when I read this it does not - it seems to be different from what you said yesterday about the CSR the decision to confine to CSR.  But can I find out this?   Do you agree that this on its own without reading the entire memo, namely, what is quoted in the first paragraph at page 128 suggests that what you said was that you - was that the decision to confine to CSR, as opposed to confined in general, irrespective of to whoeverthat is the decision that this says was extensively dissipated.   Do you accept that that is the impression it leaves?     Yeah, no, no, that is fine I just wanted to make sure that we have the same understanding. So, but what you do say is what you say that when one reads the whole document that is not the impression one will get.     And that is not what you intended it to say.     Okay, alright, Mr Myburgh.      Yes.     No, it can be done, if it is available itcan be done, that can be done anytime.     Well we spoke yesterday, briefly or I asked you a question about whether even when a matter that was to be deliberated upon by the committee related to your division, you would only be able to attend if you invited…[intervene]    And you said yes.  So I guess that when you look at the deliberations, and you formed a view that you formed which you have just articulated from your point of view, it just shows maybe that how important it is thatmaybe the head of the division should be there when the matter is dealt with that relates to them because he or she would understand issues much better than anybody else.      Does the view you have taken that it looks like nobody was involved in that, in those deliberations knew what they were talking about, at least in regard to some of the issues relating to this matter suggest that maybe even the committee did not have people whohave the kind of expertise and knowledge that would have enabled them to pick these things up to say, this thing does not make sense, this does not make sense and so on.      You see, I asked the question, because one of the issues that the Commission is going to look at is what criteria were followed in the past, in selecting people to be appointed to Boards of SOE’s and what qualifications should be - what qualifications were required, and experienced, and so on, and so on.  And as well as what skills and expertise and qualifications were required before somebody could be put into a particular committee, you know because if you took me and put me in an ITCommittee I would not know what to do. But if you are going to put people in a Board or committee where certain technical knowledge and expertise is required, and they do not have that, then managers can do all kinds of things because they do not understand, youknow everything is above them.   So That is why I was asking the question whether you think it might reflect that this was to technical and maybe the Board Committee members or some of them maybe did not have the kind of expertise that would have enabled them to pick up that this thing does not make sense and so on.      Ja, thank you, Mr Myburgh.     BB4A, somebody will help you, while they are looking for a file for you, I want to ask the question.  If both types of locomotives were to be discussed would it have made sense for you to leave before the other one was discussed?  I think you said youwould have been there or you were there for the 1064.     But you do not remember being there when the other one was discussed.  So I am just wondering whether it would have made sense for you to leave whenyou knew that they were going to discuss and the other one as well.      Okay, Mr Myburgh.    Mr Myburgh I am told there is 4(a) and 4(b) which one is it?    Did you say 553?    563.    Are we going back to Bundle 6?    Okay.    That is Bundle 7.    Hopefully you do not think it is all meant to confuse you.      Have you got the page Mr Myburgh?    I just mention this while I remember.  I hope that Mr Gama and his team did remember the issue of that email that we discussed yesterday.    Okay.    Okay alright.    I am sorry Mr Myburgh I do not see that. Are you still at page 50?   You know this is 61 and they have 51.    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes.  So where about on the page were you reading?    Yes.    Oh okay yes.  Okay.   Which was contrary to the business case document.   Well I – you will have to just speak to it a little bit more because my understanding was exactly that you were saying earlier on the business case has formulated I think at TFR made certain assumptions.    You make that point.  But I thought you said that ...[indistinct – word cut off] even if it is not all,     Ja.     H’m?     Oh, oh ...[intervenes]     ...into account. MR     Taking in account.     But there was some forex not taking into account.    H’m?     Uhm ...[intervenes]      And what bundle is it?     Oh, okay.     Okay.  And have we got the page or isthat the beginning?     At the beginning.     Oh, okay.       But before going there, I just wanted to go to page 405 because I know Mr Myburgh draw attention to that.  I see there at the last page that says excluding the potential effects from forex hedging, forex escalationand other price escalations.  But you say we must go to 435?     Ja.     Well ...[intervenes]     Yes but before you proceed.  I do not think anybody thinks that they were saying the exchange rate would remain fixed.  My understanding is that when you talk about what certain items having been excluded or included, my understanding is that people are talking about what was taking into account and what was not taking into account with an understanding that its estimates.     And there are assumptions but if you did not include in your calculations and assumptions certain items, then they say you have excluded them.     So I just wanted to mention that.     That is my understanding.     442?     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Yes?     Ja, ja.     Yes, because I was about to say ...[intervenes]      Ja.     I was about to say.  As far as theRand/Dollar exchange is concerned, what you have been saying does not seem to me to going to inclusion or exclusion.     It simply goes to whether your estimatesproved to be correct or not.     And of course with these things it is not – you never have certainty.     You know, it is a certain estimate.     And obviously, you have to adjust when you come to the day.     To say what is the – what is today’s rate.     So it seems to me that, based on what you are saying, one would not say – one would say it was included but maybe the estimation might have been lower than what it should have been.     Ja.     Ja.    Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     [laughs]  Well ...[intervenes]      Ja.     H’m.     H’m.  Mr Myburgh.     ...anybody says that Mr Gama.       Nobody says that.     Nobody is saying that.     H’m.  Mr Myburgh.     When you said there was some foreign exchange that was taken into account, other foreign exchange...  [Speaker ’s voice drops – unclear]  What were you talking about?     H’m?     Yes, I understand ...[intervenes]      ...that is part of ...[intervenes]      Yes, on the ...[intervenes]      ...account.[Speakers intervening each other – unclear]     H’m.     Are you saying that what you say in the paragraph that Mr Myburgh has read from your affidavit is the same as what they say in the minutes?     Saying you are saying the same thing?     I am sorry.  You are reading from where now Mr Myburgh.     Oh, okay.     Ja, okay.     Well ...[intervenes]      Yes, I think that given that Mr Gama hasdeposed to an affidavit dealing with these issues and has expressed his views, ordinarily there should be nothing wrong with putting somebody else’s view or conclusion and     I think where we have a problem(?), he can put it or where something that consider contentious, let us – we will look at that.  Well, remember just earlier on Mr Myburgh read mister – a passage from Mr Gama’s own affidavit and he confirmed it, he stood by it and it was in accordance, as I understood it, at least with those who said this features were included.       Yes.     Well, let us do it this way.  Mr Gama, ifyou are not able to say you agree or you do not agree without the context, say so and then the context can be put to you but if you know that you do not have a problem with what is put to you, you can then give your view.  Okay?  But if you want context, say so.    Yes.     Yes.     Of his ...[intervenes]      Testimony ...[intervenes]      Yes, okay.     Ja.     Yes.  Mr Myburgh.     Ja.     I saw it, ja.     Yes.     One second, Mr Myburgh?  It looks like there are two files and she is not sure which one you are referring to.     I am sorry, is that 714?     Oh.     I may have missed this, Mr Myburgh and Mr Gama, when you were elaborating or dealing with your understanding of the phrase excluding blah, blah, blah, that we found at page 002 or was it 05?       002, ja, you were saying that it was included, you said the features – you made the example of the Forex, you said some was included or some features were included, others were not included under Forex but I do not think you got to talk about other items that they saidwere excluded to indicate whether your view as the same in regard to the other items other than Forex.     Ja.     Ja.     So what you said in respect of Forex applies to the other items as well.     Okay.  Mr Myburgh?     Just remind me what bundle it is or have you got it?     Oh, okay, okay, she has got it.  Ja, what page should we go to?     Okay.    174 being the page and 78.11 being the paragraph?     Ja.     Yes, I have got it.     Okay.     Sorry, is that a different bundle?     Have you got the page number?     Have you found it Mr Gama?       H’m.   Is it something your junior Mr Myburgh could look for while you continue with other questions, or not?  Or you would prefer to try and deal with it now?     I intended that we would take a break at six, a ten minutes break, maybe we should take it now that might help with looking for it.     Ja, shall we say ten minutes or shall we say fifteen up to six?     To give you more time to look, ja.      Okay.       Yes.     You understand ...[intervenes]      Do you want to start with the bundle, what bundle it is?     BB28.    2508?     250.158.     148.  Yes that is where it starts.     Okay, do you have the specific part where he deals with it or shall we take the break and thenit will be easier to find it?     Yes, well okay let’s take the normalbreak we were going to take then, fifteen minutes and then we come back.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let’s continue.  Sorry the aircon noise, they will attend to it, okay.     We were looking for that part in the affidavit that gives the ...[intervenes]      Okay.     That is in the middle of the first paragraph at page 173.     635million?     With the – would it be correct that probably you first sign and then it occurred to you that you needed clarification of certain matters and that is why you make those notes because otherwise you wouldn’t sign ...[intervenes]      Oh, so I thought maybe if you are not approving or this one it says approved, or not approved, it is not clear what you were saying.     But it was implied that they would need to come back to you?     Ja, so they couldn’t take your signature and go somewhere and say this has been approved.     Ja, so from that point of view it is not finally approved.    Ja, okay, alright.     On what page?     Okay.     Try not lower your voice Mr Gama, trynot lower your voice, so that whatever you ...[intervenes]      I think your voice went lower.     Yes Mr Myburgh?    Yes.    That is Bundle 6?    42? I am sorry.Did you say from ...[intervenes]      Yes.    Okay.     [No audible reply]      H’m.     Well ...[intervenes]  MR     ...there are many witnesses who haveappeared before me.     I have no recollection of what you are talking about ...[intervenes]      ...personally(?) ...[intervenes]   I ask witnesses questions and ...[intervenes]      ...they may or may not think what is behind the questions.     H’m.  But obviously, there is no desire to make them change what they intend to say, if it is the truth.     H’m.     Is that 250.160?     250...  H’m?     Oh, okay.  The number at the bottom.  Okay.       Is that...  The one with ...[intervenes]      Ja.     Was it more the Chairperson who was having this maybe heated debate with them or the whole committee?     Okay, continue?     And what is the page number?     Maybe this would be a convenient time to take another ten minutes adjournment?     Let us take a ten minutes adjournment and then we will resume.  We adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let’s continue.    Page?     Do you remember whether irrespective of whether this note from – an instruction note from Treasury applies or not, whether Transnet had a policy on how to deal with unsolicited proposals.     Would you remember what, whether – would you remember any important features of that policyor that is something you cannot remember now?      Okay, Mr Myburgh.     H’m, okay.     Is that in a different bundle?     Okay.  At 250?     Okay.     You know normally when you put as S & H and say all amounts you would ...[indistinct] what would follow after that is whichever is the higher or bigger or lesser depending on what you want to say, so I don’t know whether they have left that out or whether when you read it you are supposed to – it is implied to sa ...[intervenes]      Whichever is the higher, because maybe you say whichever is the lower it wouldn’t make muchsense I am not sure.        Yes, of course you would appreciate that – or a comment, or the Commission, part of why we have to do that even with hindsight is to establish where things did go wrong, how they went wrong and what it is that could have been done to prevent them from happening and whatmeasures would be put in place to make sure that in the future the same things don’t happen, so you have to say okay this is what happened and how did it happen, people were supposed to ensure that it – certain requirements were met, not do their job, and so on, so ja, okay.  Mr Myburgh?        I am sorry his réponse is on what page?     Okay thank you.    H’m.    Just for the transcribers Makhunga will be M-a-k-h-u-n-g-a and Nomvelo N-o-m-v-e-l-o.  You know sometimes when you read the transcript you find that you cannot even make head or tail of what they have writtenbecause they did not know the spelling.  Ja okay.     To act in your position.    At the – at this function.   My Myburgh there is  …   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay what is your objection?    Ja.    Would not indicate what?    But it is the position not that we saw another one that showed – or was it an email that showed that was it Sahara or somebody who had paid?    What – what – there was something that referred to either Sahara or somebody connected with the Gupta’s that we dealt with last time.    Either an email or the invoice I cannot remember which one.    Well he has not said so.  He has not said so.    Well let us see if and when he gets there.  But later on you – you may re-examine to clarify whatever issues might not have been clarified.  Okay.  Mr Myburgh.     Ja.     No, no he is not being put under pressure.  All Mr Myburgh is saying is.  When he said he had reached the end of his questions, he could have said that is it but he just thought just in case there is something that he missed and Mr Gama might wish to say something.      Ja.  No, no ...[intervenes]      No, no that is why Mr Myburgh was just trying to make sure that in case he has missed outsomething if you remember something, you can deal with it.  But there is the opportunity to clarify something when your counsel re-examines you ...[intervenes]      ...or in terms of arrangements that willbe made to file an affidavit.     Okay thank you.  Counsel for Mr Gama, is there an arrangement that has been reached subject to my approval or what is the position in terms of clarifying anything, re-examination?     Ja.    Ja.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Okay.     Ja.     Okay no that is fine.  Mr Myburgh, you have ...[intervenes]      Yes, that will put in action, ja.  Do you want to give an idea of what you have in mind in terms of timeframe, because it is better if we have a timeframe.     Seven days?     That is about how long?  How long from now?  Today is what?     That is three weeks.  I think that is too long but I would be prepared to give you more than seven days, as I was indicating.  I am prepared to give you up to on or before 25 May.  Is that fine?     H’m.     But ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes, but of course ...[intervenes]      28 t h?     Okay no that is alright then.  The deadline is 28 then.     Okay alright.  Thank you Mr Gama for your cooperation.  Thank you for – to your legal team.  Thank you Mr Myburgh and your team.  Thank you to the investigators.  Thank you to the technicians and the staff.  Thank you to everybody for all your cooperation to enable us to work until this time.  We will adjourn now.  For the benefit of the public.  Tomorrow I will be hearing the evidence of Mosebenzi Zwane in relation to Eskom, former Minister of Mineral Resources.  We adjourn.
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Dr Dintwe you will have to put the microphone closer to you please.      Is it necessary for the oath to be taken?    Thank you Chair.  Dr Dintwe your statement in affidavit form is before the Chair in Bundle SSA2(b) and it is Exhibit YY15.  We ended the last session of your evidence at page 812 the black numbers in the topleft hand corner of the pages.    You gave evidence before we adjourned in relation to an appointment or the approval of appointment you say without due process by Mr Bongani Bongo and you deal with that in paragraphs 119, 120 and 121 of that page. You informed me just before commencement of your evidence today that there was an issue that you wish to clarify.     Please so so.    Alright.  Just to summarise then you gave evidence last time of an appointment which was called into question by your office.    As being irregular.    You conducted an investigation andmade certain recommendations.    The Minister – Minister Dlodlo raised what appeared to be procedural concerns about who had been heard and who had not been heard.   You responded to those complaints maintained your recommendation and the matter was from your point of view not resolved.    If we could go over the page then please to page 813.  You deal in the paragraphs on that page and over the page with appointments to the cadet program and to other portions or departments within State Security.  Page – paragraph 122 just very briefly whathappened in relation to those appointments there or recommendations.    Alright you have given me examples in paragraphs 122 to 124 and the facts are set out there but in principle what is wrong if a Minister of State Security suggests a particular candidate for a cadet program with theundertaking that that person will then employed by SSA?  Surely a Minister can identify a person suitable for such appointment on his or her own?  What is – what is the problem with this Ministerial overreach as you call it?    Alright.  What about – yes you do not mention…    Alright.  So that – the danger of nepotism you do mention as a general point but the – in paragraph 122 you do say there are other instances of the children and family members of senior politicians and Ministers being appointed to these cadet positions.  You do mention that.  But the particular examples you give here are not examples of nepotism.    Oh I see.   I am – I understand what you are saying.    Alright.  The second point is what is the – what are the issues around the future loyalty of the SSA member a cadet becomes a SSA operative about thepotential of partial loyalty to the person influential in his or her appointment, is that a problem?    And then in addition to that you have testified to the Chair that you are not clear whether the requirements – the appointment requirements were actuallyfollowed in each case.    Just in summary then as a matter ofprinciple at the bottom of page – or at the end of paragraph    And adequate suitability of thecandidate for the post being properly assessed.  The second is that there would a potential of the relationship between the state official or the Minister and the operative being exploited.  I suppose both ways is it possible that the operative would be loyal then to the Minister and theMinister could exercise influence over the operative.  Is that a valid observation that you make?     The period that you are referring to, is that the period covered by the PAN 1 Report, Principal Hedge and Network 1 Report, that period?     Alright.  And the allegation - and it is an allegation for the moment, we may deal with thatlater, Chair - is that people who were implicated in the PAN 1 Report were reappointed to the SSA.      Is that what ...[intervenes]  DR     I see.     Alright.  So it is promotion you are talking about?     Just to summarise then.  The Cadet Programme, the Bursary Programme has its outcome appointment into the ranks of the SSA.  Correct?     And you have given examples of ministerial involvement in the selection and appointment informally, of course, into that programme.     And your concern is that the proper procedures are bypassed in that process.    In relation to the 26, you speak about irregular promotions to senior positions within the SSA.     But all these are done under the direction rather than the recommendation of the minister, as I understand what you are saying.     What is wrong with that?     So, as I understand it, the minister does not approve finally but is involved in the process leading up to his or her approval, irregularly?     In paragraph 124, page 813 you     Right.  You go on in that paragraph    So do I understand you correctly tobe saying that one of the principles of employment in State Security particularly, and I presume it applies throughout the public service, is that the person appointed must be completely independent of external influence?     Particularly influence in regard to their appointment in the first place?     You go on in the next section, paragraph 125 and following, to deal with the controlsrelating to the use and flow of money in the Intelligence Services.  Now we have heard detailed evidence in this regard.  You give evidence of a more general nature arising out of your own experience and independent investigations.  What have been your findings?  You deal with that in paragraph 125 and following.     Right.  In paragraph 126 you go into a little more detail.  Would you deal with that?  Butbefore you do.  The documents that you are yet to provide in the various bundles supporting your statement, do they contain more evidence of this?     Alright.  So that documentation, wetrust, will be forthcoming hopefully as soon as possible Dr Dintwe.       Yes.  Paragraph 126, you go into a little more detail.    Alright.     Nineteen, I think.     [laughs]     Alright.  You are saying, firstly, that the use of cash is inherently problematic, although it might be necessary, I think, that has been conceded by you elsewhere, but it is the accounting and the documentary records in relation to the disbursements of cash that is of concern.  Is that correct?     We will deal an extract from one of the reports you actually made in this regard over the page but for the moment if we could stay on paragraph 126.  You say you raised concerns about the prevalence of large sums of cash being withdrawn at the SSA and that is in relation to the 16/2017 Financial Year of SSA Operations.      [Indistinct]      Alright.     Right.  Now these claims that were made - complaints that were raised with your office.  Yousay you investigated and you made findings.       And those findings highlighted concerns over the use of cash and the improper or inadequate accounting for that cash.     Now you say that you raised these issues in certificates.  Who receives your certificates?     Now in regard to the latter.  Without the intervention of the minister or the director general or acting director general, as the case may be, in each security establishment, there is a direct reporting between your own office and the Joint Standing Committeeof Intelligence.  Do I understand that correctly?     What did the JSCI do on receipt of these certificates in relation to the improper use of cash, as you found?     Do you know why?     You conduct in your office an oversight role over the executives, correct?     And you do so independently.     With your knowledge of what oversight entails, are you satisfied that the JSCI performedits functions adequately?     [laughs]     You are not misrepresenting me, Chairperson, you have got a very sharp memory.     In paragraph 127 on page 814 you cite two examples.  I would just like to ask whether you     Is this a convenient time, Chair?  It is, let us take a 15 minutes break, we will resume at halfpast eleven.     Thank you, Chair.     The examples that you have given to the Chair, Dr Dintwe, both at a general level and at a particular level.  Were these included in the certificates that were given to parliament and to the Minister and theheads of department?     In paragraph 128 you raise a concern about the possible use of these monies.  What do you say about that?  That is on page 815.    And that information too would be in the certificates.     Or at least to the joint standing committee on Intelligence.     You say in paragraph 129 that you made certain recommendations in a report and you talk of one of your reports, would this report have been included in your certificates?    Okay, so it was a certificate reported to all those instances to whom you have referred including the JSCI?    Right.     Would those reports go to parliament?     I see.     Right.  Perhaps you should read onto the record your recommendation in paragraph 129.     Thank you.    And then you go in page 815, paragraph 130 to talk of recommendations that you made inyour capacity as Inspectors General Intelligence.  What were those?     A little bit?     No, you used the word a little bit.  Was it just a figure of speech?     We have heard the evidence of Mr Jafta as to what steps have been taken more recently in relation to financial controls but it appears from yourevidence that what you are saying is a substantial review of control measures and their implementation is required within the SSA and other intelligence organs.     Right.  And you say that steps should be taken to recover outstanding temporary advances from members who have not settled those.     Now all these issues concerning financial controls, the absence of financial controls, the loss of state security monies, the inadequate controls over the use of cash are – and which you have now highlighted over the last hour or so, your report or your reports or your certificates audit to the JSCI and the Ministers would contain detail in this regard.     And would contain detail in regard to your recommendations.    How is – and these questions I have been asked to raise in relation to further evidence to be led by Adv Freund, who I have spoken to in the break, Chair – to whom does this report go in particular?  I mean,does it go to the secretary of the JSCI?  The Chair of the JSCI?     Right, who is the Chairperson of the JSCI or who was the Chairperson of the JSCI at the time you would have been submitting these reports?     And did you ever have occasion to speak to any member of the JSCI and say what is going on?  Why are you ignoring my recommendations?  What are you doing about my reports.  Was there any interaction ofthat nature either in correspondence or verbally?     So you would have in discussions raised concerns about your certificates, how they were considered and what was being done in response thereto?    Are you able to say – do you feel comfortable to say what General Holomisa said to you?     Well, whether that is a satisfactory explanation or not from a member of parliament issomething we will make submissions on in due course, Chair.     But in summary then, the problems that you have raised, the impropriety, the illegalities, the loss of monies, the inadequate accounting for monies, the looting that you have spoken about, the improper use of monies in factional battles, those are all in your reports.     No member of the JSCI can claim ignorance of what you have reported to the JSCI.     So when we get those certificates the Chair will be able to see exactly what the JSCI knew,apart from the redaction.       Chair, our understanding, we have looked at this quite carefully and have consulted externallyas well, is that you would be entitled, as Chair, to see the unredacted versions of the certificates.     However, for the purposes of your report and whatever goes public, the redacted version would be necessary to be revealed.     Provided, of course, the person in control and who has the lawful power to deal with it agrees.    And that is Dr Dintwe.     We will consider the position.     Thank you.  In paragraph 131, page 816, you deal with what is another serious issue in your terms in relation to Crime Intelligence and you say in     So a senior official would require a subordinate to go and collect money allegedly for thepayment of a source.     That money would be given to the senior official who had no authority to deal with sources at all.    And that senior official would then say or claim, perhaps not, that that money had been handed to a source, correct?     But the person accounting to the system, as it were, the accounting system, would be therunner, the person deputised by the senior official, is that correct?     Yes, that is a point I wanted toraise, the subordinate or the runner who is used to collect the money allegedly to hand over to a source and as used by the senior officer, that subordinate or runner has never seen, in this example, the source.     Cannot.  But, nevertheless, accounts and says that the money has gone to the source.     And there is an added element that you have just said that perhaps the public requires a more detailed explanation or a clearer summary.  Chair, I will attempt to do that.  The CFO says to a subordinate you goand fetch money and you tell administration that it is for a source and you give it to me.     And then the CFO says I am going to give it to a source.  He may or may not do so.     Right.  So he may keep the money.     He may give the money for another illegitimate purpose because the CFO has no mandate orpower to deal with monies in this way.     That is why he must use a subordinate who had the power to go and get the money in the first place.    But importantly, also to report that the money has been given to the source, when he does not know that at all.     You give another example in paragraph 134, page 817, but you have dealt with the system that can be used or abused.  Paragraph 135 you    On investigations into the detail?    And you have summarised the findings here, or you have summarised the type of malfeasance that occurred?     Right, would these issues and reports and findings also be included in your certificates?     Alright.  You then say something in     Is it also clear to all concerned interms of the legislation that classification cannot be used as a reason for not giving you documentation?       Right.     Yes.     That's good.     Right.     We will come to those in detail indue course.  The regulations in terms of security are unfortunately and ironically and quite improperly kept in our submission themselves secret.  So the law or the regulation which says you cannot use classification to conceal criminality secret, but that principle is widelyknown, as I understand it.     Yes, please.     So it has the consequence, Chair, that any person affected or interested in unlawful classification of documents cannot source the very regulation that deals with it.     Yes.  Well, Chair, the idea that one could classify the law.      Yes.  And it goes a lot further than criminality.  It talks about administrative abuse as well, that classification cannot be used.  We can get the wording.  I think you deal with it somewhere in your statement.  You deal with the expression and the missed document, but let us deal with it when we get there.  Inparagraph 136 – well, perhaps we should then just clarify what you say in paragraph 135, that these abuses, this criminality, is reported to a law enforcement agency.     It is up to them to take it further in terms of law enforcement, prosecution and the like.     Now, but you say that – in paragraph 1.35 you make the point that these law enforcement agencies, their investigations and prosecutions are hampered by their refusal to declassify documents.    And in paragraph 136 what is the evidence that you give there?      It is another form of fraud ormalfeasance.     So procurement funds, funds for procurement, are basically stolen.     And just to confirm once more, these various investigations in their detail, including your findings and recommendations, would be in the certificates you have spoken about.     Okay.  Let's move on then to paragraph 137 on page 817.  What is a grabber without revealing too much method?     Okay.     If the grabber is placed in therequired radius of a party conference, and you gave this evidence now, it would be possible for the person in control of the grabber to hear everything that is spoken over a cell phone.     Emails as well.     So all electronic communicationswould be able to be monitored within the specific required radius of the grabber?      So in paragraph 137 you refer to media reports.  Would you, without naming the companyand the name of the person who is the director of the company, please – and I will explain the circumstances thereto in due course, but would you tell the Chair the story of the grabber?      And its procurement.     Ivani?     That is a group?     I would say in summary there was an attempt to procure and it seems to me that you suggest,at least in your statement or your affidavit, at an exorbitant price a grabber for use at the NASREC conference of December 2017.     Is it correct that that intended procurement was halted by IPID?     And amongst the reasons, as you say in your statement, was that the company from whom the grabber was to be procured had already been flaggedin relation to irregular procurement previously.     So not only was the procurement process irregular, not only was the party from whom the grabber would be procured already under investigation for irregular procurement, but you had information that you used to which the grabber would be – sorry, not the grabber – used to which the money would be used, either through inflated procurement ...[indistinct] inflatedprocurement prices was the information you received was to buy votes at NASREC.     Right.  And during this process when problems arose about the procurement, influence was sought to be exercised on you to facilitate the project.  Isthat correct?       Well, let's tell the Chair about that, please?       Alright.  Now, so Mr Mbindwane had been involved in procurement at all?     But should he have been involved?       Alright.  And the relevant crimeintelligence unit that would have been responsible for the purchase of this grabber, was it ever consulted?  Did you investigate this issue?      They didn't even know?      Alright.  Now, you say ...    Alright.  Now, you say in paragraph     Right.  So you were relying on media reports.  You had a suspicion.  Those suspicionswere corroborated but you have no knowledge of that fact, of the vote-buying.     Right.  But you say that that matter is under investigation by IPID.    Now, well, that is the point.  IPID was investigating the series of events, right?       Were they able to access the relevant documentation?       Not at that stage.  Before the court case?      And how did this affect their ability to investigate this obvious – well, certainly obvious allegations of criminality?      Now, all these are serious allegations.  Are they currently still under investigation?       Right.  And is your office investigating the matter?      And would you have reported your investigations through the various instances in your certificates or would you do that in the future?      So all this has been reported to Parliament?     And the response?    Was this reported to you, thisconcern?     Right.  So did you make a presentation on the basis of your certificate to the JSCI in relation to this?     And what ...?  Well, I suppose theproceedings are top secret.  Is that not correct?       So we will consider that position and deal with it but maybe the Chair wants to ask a question.     And the correct position, at least the position evidence by the documents now declassified and public was at least that General Sithole did not approve.    Right, you deal in paragraph 144 Dr Dintwe with a new issue and that is an issue involving the same company, Ivane’s company and you deal with a different form of corruption or malfeasance in relation to information technology, solutions for Intelligence collection. Could you tell the Chair briefly about what happened here, you deal with in paragraph 144 and 145 of your statement?     Alright but just stop there, I am sorry to do this, but I think maybe you and I are out of synchere. I think you are dealing here with paragraphs 146 and 147 the voice encryption system.      If you could go back please to paragraph 144 where there was a quotation from the Council for Scientific Industrial Research, CSIR, for the amount of R7million for a particular software solution, and tell the Chair about that incident please, and then we will get on to the voice encryption system.     So at the top of page 820.     For R33million.      Yes, but to make matters worse, you then did an investigation to find out whether this ITsolution had ever been actually installed.     And what did you discover?     So quotations go out for an IT solution CSIR, say we are provided for R7million.     This particular company says wewill give it to you for R33million.     It is procured from this company, in inverted commas.     Monies are paid but nothing is installed on your finding.     And you relate that your personal visit and your personal investigations in paragraph 145 and you say you were informed that the original product no longer existed and had since been replaced but you couldn't be shown the replacement either, is that correct?     Right.     So your conclusion was in paragraph 145, that the amount of R73million was fraudulently paid from Crime Intelligence to this company     What would be secret about theseprocurement documents?     Right, and then on paragraphs 146 and 147 on page 820 and following, you deal with the voice encryption system, procurement process, what happened there just briefly?  You talk about cover quoting.     Which was also existent you say in relation to the previous issue that you have discussed the software solution, you said that prescripts were not followed.     Here prescripts were also not followed in relation to the voice encryption system where it was procured for about R23 million.     And you say that all manner ofprocurement requirements were flouted.     Yes, you say    Right, but…[intervene]     The cost of this procurement, you say in paragraph 146, was R23million.      However you investigated thematter and you saw competing quotes one for R58million, were those genuine competing quotes?     And that - those were your findings in investigating the facts.     Okay, alright so a related companyissues a quote for R58million and I understand what you mean by cover quoting it makes the quote for R23 million look reasonable.      Is that the point, you are making?     Chair, I must place on record that we have a response from the company, the director who is     Can we move on then on page 8712 to the failure of oversight over the Intelligence Services.  Now we have dealt with this piecemeal in several parts of your affidavit to date but if you could just summarise what you say, in paragraphs, 148 to 150 please,and you can do it in summary form because we have dealt with these issues.     Alright, but in relation to that you have given evidence to the Chair about your independence, or lack of independence, the structural and organisational challenges you face as the office of the OGI its capacitation and funding, we have dealt with that evidence    You have dealt with issues in relation to this earlier in your statement last time you appeared before the Chair.  But would the same comments that you make now apply to the JSCI with the JSCI is not unrelated in this series of events?    You say in paragraph 149 if I may     Alright.     In paragraph one...[intervene]     In fact, have you sought to secure your powers through Court intervention?     In paragraph 151, on page 822, Dr Dintwe, you deal with the failure to implement the recommendations of the OIGI, you have dealt with this issue in questions, in answers to questions to the Chair.     And so perhaps my question was put in to general a term, as I understand, what you are saying is that the Chair has now pointed out is that many of your recommendations and reports would be directed specifically at functional officers, for example, the Ministry and the Director Generals of Intelligence Services, it would be their duty to consider your reports andrecommendations and where appropriate to implement.     Yes, but to the extent that they are not implemented an oversight body, such as yourself and the JSCI, would then come into play and be accountable for the failure to exercise oversight over the non-implementation of your recommendations.    And then in paragraph 153, you     As for your recommendation, the Chair will have to think about that further.  Chair it is 1 o’clock.     I would be at least another hourand I will try my best to finish within that time.     Okay I have communicated this to the next…[intervene]   Thank you Chair.  Dr Dintwe much of what follows to the conclusion of your affidavit we have dealt with albeit piecemeal and out of order already so given the constraints that we have in regard to time I am going tosummarise and extract what I think are important passages from your affidavit of course if I leave anything out you will take me to task on that issue and intervene.You deal in paragraph 154 on page 822.    Of course.    What document was that?    On the 6t h of March.    Thank you Chair.  On page 822 at the bottom of the page you deal with the issue of limited access to information and you have throughout your evidence have raised the issue of the – in regard to the fact that you andlaw enforcement agencies do not have free access to information enabling you to do your job adequately.      Let alone ideally. In paragraph 154    And you say in paragraph 155   When you talk about constructive refusal what do you mean.    So whilst there may not always be adirect refusal of information the conduct of the party from whom information is sought might make it clear that you are not going to get the information whatever you do.    That is some interesting example.    We may be the opposite on the other hand.      Lawyers could not con students of    In paragraphs 158 and 159 on page 824 you deal with your conclusion that there has been some resistance by the intelligence services and you talking there crime intelligence I understand to criminal investigation by    On page 824 paragraph 158 you deal with the concerted effort as you put it by management of crime intelligence to ensure that pending cases do not off the ground and avoid detection by oversight bodies.  And you go so far as to say it had become clear that the implicated persons and entities enjoy the continued protection of the divisional management.  You have just referred to one exception and General Lazarus and the proceedings against him would be another exception.    Matters were pursued against him.    And of course there may be others but you deal with your findings I presume of your investigations and summarise those in paragraph 159, am I correct?    Right.  And you then go on in paragraph 160 on page 824 and following to deal with in general terms the refusal of intelligence services todeclassify information that relates to suspicious transactions or criminality and you have given examples and you have stated that on a few occasions in your evidence.  But for example in paragraph 161 you deal with the contention that it would be palpably wrong for intelligence services to hidebehind classification of documents in instances of suspicion of criminality.  Procurement issues for example need not be regarded as secret and if there are secret elements they could be redacted, am I correct?    Issues relating to safe houses and I am told by you that many of those issues are contained in documents which are refused declassification.  How could that be dealt with?    And in relation to safe houses I think you suggested in consultation that one could just redact the address of that.    A safe house.  Then in paragraph 163 you deal with the mis-document and that document as I understand it adopted by cabinet on 4 December 1996 isavailable on the internet.    In any event you say in paragraph 163  “The mis-document deals with classification and declassification of information.Of particular relevance to the issue at hand as paragraph 3 of the mis-document which setsout guidelines on the procedure for classification and the declassification of classified documents.”And insofar as it is necessary we can deal with that in submissions to you Chair.“The mis-document provides an explanation on classification documents and in particular paragraph 3.4 gives an injunction that security measures are not intended and should not be applied to cover up maladministration, corruption, criminal action etcetera or to protect individuals/officials involved in such cases.”The point about that is that the mis-document precludes classification in categories far wider than justcorruption and criminal action.It includes mis-maladministration and I think regulation 3 of the Security Services document goes so far as to say that classification cannot be used to preclude or prevent embarrassment to officials.  Words to that effect I may not have the precise words but the point I – as I have – understand from mis is that classification is precluded or prevented or prohibited in broader range of cases than simple corruption and criminal.    And you say in paragraph 165  “The mis-document enjoins the head of an institution to test on a regular basis classification of documents generated in the institution and further provides that overclassification of documents must be guarded against.”It seems that the point that is made there is the duty to manage classification as an on-going duty.  It is not as if a document once classified it remains classified forever.  Is that correct?    And in paragraph 167 you refer to the judgment of the constitutional court in the Independent newspaper versus Minister for intelligence case where the Deputy Chief Justice Moseneke laid down several factors to be considered when the disclosure of classified documents is being dealt with and he lists there a number of factors that must be considered when a document which is formerlyclassified is sought to be declassified.    And you say in any event in paragraph 170 it has been said that members of IPID as is the case with members of the OIGI have security clearanceto the level of top secret.  So there would be no reason for refusing classified documents to you.  The law prohibits that anyway but to IPID.  They have security clearance anyway as I understand.    Right.  And then in paragraph 171 you put before the Chair several examples of the mis-use or overuse of classification. For example a case involving the procurement of blinds and curtains by crime intelligence officials.  Any reason why those documents should be classified?   Ja and that is because of over-classification of documents.    In any event you have given examples and you have spoken already of examples in relation to procurement of IT Solutions and the like.  They are there for the record.     Understood.  At paragraph 172 youdeal and that is on page 829 you deal with a – quite an ironic situation and that is where the law enforcement agencies are saying in relation to criminality, misconduct and the like only you as the officer of IGI have jurisdiction.  That seems rather strange in the context of the evidence you have given.  Could you explain the problems attached to that approach?    Yes and you have restricted powers anyway.  You have no powers to prosecute.    Or be disciplined.  You have recommendation powers only.     Obviously investigative powers but ultimately powers of recommendation.  So do I understand     And what was your response tothat?     Right.  You were told by IPID, and you relate this in paragraph 174, that this view that only the IPI can deal with the issue of criminality, fraud or malfeasance within Crime Intelligence, that this view was relied upon in the investigation of the criminal charges against the former Divisional Commissioner, General Mduli during or about 2011.  Is that correct?  Can you confirm that?    And you say it has been raised frequently during your tenure.     And in response to what you have just told the Chair about the use of your offices as a clearing house for declassification which you have resisted.  Clearly, the duties will lie elsewhere.  Documents must be declassified at the Lord Chester and if they no longer deserve classification.      Addressed to the minister.  It will be in your documents.   “I indicated that in instances of suspicion of criminality involving classified documents,the Divisional Commissioner and/or the National Commissioner were duty bound to reconsider earlier classification of documents. Moreover, Crime Intelligence should, as a general rule, be inclined in favourable classification of documents in order to rely for proper and unhindered criminal investigation and possible criminal prosecution...”So as I understand your position that the duty to monitor classification and to declassify documents were appropriate, cannot be roistered upon your office.     In paragraph 182, it seems that the JSCI became quite active in summoning you to appear before it.  What was the issue you were required to explain?     182.  Concerning the leakage of information.  Just read the paragraph and tell the Chair, please, what point you are making there.     Okay.  But anyway, there the JSCI was active in calling you to account.    Alright.     Alright.  Then in paragraph 183, on page 833 you deal with quite an important topic, really.  And that is the role of the Auditor General in relation to the audit reports of Intelligence Services.  And you say in     So that very category of funds that you have investigated and shown to be the source of much corruption and blatant looting and theft, as you put it, is concealed from the Auditor General.  Is that right?     And of course, it stands to reason, as I think you said elsewhere, that monies would be allocated to those sectors of the SSA operations precisely to conceal, to keep them away from auditing processes.     You say then in paragraph 187, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the lack of skills and experience and expertise in the audit process, your office has observed that there was large scale flouting of rules and legal prescripts by the Intelligence Services.  It was observed that chaos and maladministration thrived and you say that in paragraph 187.     And you say in paragraph 187 that the IGI certificates, those are your reports to various instances, have included in them a list of suspicious financial transactions and these have been reported to the ministers, the JSCI and the relevant heads of the Intelligence Services.  Is that correct?     And you give one instance here where certain of these financial irregularities in your view were also reported to the current President while he wasstill the Deputy President.     We will deal with that matter in due course but having said that.  There must obviously be some balance between secrecy on the one hand and the need for proper financial auditing on the other.  Quite how that problem is to be solved is a matter that the Chair may consider.  But do you have any comment in the solution to that issue?     Alright.  Is this document, this benchmarking report, available?     The benchmarking report that you spoke of.     I could be wrong.  You mentioned that there might be international literature available on how internationally and acceptable intelligence services are audited.     Alright.     It was another comment you made that we can pursue that in due course.     In paragraph 188, you draw a conclusion arising out of the latter part of your affidavit.      Chair, it is necessary to deal just very briefly, hopefully, with a few matters that have arisen...[intervenes]      ...since Dr Dintwe last gave evidence.     The first I have dealt with and that is the company and the director of the company, Ivani, that was involved in procurement.  They have presented a version.  That can only be given to you or given to the Chair for publication, at least, once certain procedureshave been gone through and perhaps we can do that in writing and due course.The second is that there have been certain media statements by Mr Bongo.  I am not going to deal with the evidence given through the media.  It matters what beraised before the Commission, they must be raised directly.  Then Mr Arthur Fraser has given a response to your evidence.  That document is not before the Chair yet but again, it may be necessary to obtain written responses.  They are not being ignored.Then I have an affidavit from “Danny” and he was involved in the vetting security clearance of Mr Nxasana and he gives a version that differs from your version in some respects and I want to put that version to you in summary form.  It is a long affidavit and it will beput before the Chair.  He says that around October 2013, he was instructed by the then director General to commence a vetting process of Mr Nxasana who had been appointed as the National Director of Public Prosecutions.  And he says there was a vetting field investigator appointed, a unit head initiated a polygraph examination, and the polygraph examiner found that the subject that Mr Nxasana was being truthful. She was of the opinion that the subject qualifiedfor top secret clearance.  And in this phase, the vetting evaluator made a recommendation that a security clearance be issued.  So that process, that initial process in October 13 and the months that followed, recommended that each step that the clearance begranted.He then says the file was handed over the Vetting Evaluation Divisional Head and upon consideration of all the relevant information contained in the file, the recommendation that a security clearance be issued was confirmed.  Alright.    What year?  2014?     Right, I understand.     And it may be the issue of whether a certificate was actually signed by the Director General rather than all the processes being concluded to the point where for all intents and purposes the certificate ought to have been granted.     So it may be – what Danny says is that no certificate was granted in the sense that it wassigned by the Director General and actually issued to him and then taken away or the decision reversed?  You seem to be saying that that could be correct but not in the sense that all the administrative procedures had been concluded in favour of the granting of a certificate.    So Danny may say the rubber stamp at the end of the process was not there, you are saying everything leading up to that required the issue of a certificate.       But it seems that both Danny and yourself are very clear that the process and its culmination resulted in an outcome that was not justified.       And that the Chair will look at in relation to other evidence involving Mr Nxasana and we do not need to go into that here.     Yes, that is the last issue.     So you are saying that theunavailability or loss of the records was for a particular period when Danny was not in office?     Yes, he himself refers to a period when he was out of office in his affidavit.     Alright, just one last question, if I may, and that is in relation to PAN1, Principal Agent Network.  That report, the summary of that report, do you have it?    Do you feel that you can legitimately give it to the Commission?     Alright.     These are events over a decade ago, there is controversy over whether they have been properly dealt with, there are allegations of criminality or maladministration, at least, there does not seem from ourpoint of view at least any reason for the continued classification of that document.     Yes.  And then finally, if I may just ask you, were you present at any stage where the PAN1 report was presented to any ministerial or other official?     Alright.  Thank you, Chair, those are the questions.     Yes, Chair, thank you. 
DR DINTWE:    Good morning Chair.    Setlhomamaru Isaac Dintwe.    No objection.    I do.   So help me God.    I confirm that I can see that.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Honourable Chair I am not amending what I would have written there but I could have created an impression that the Minister accepted our findings andrecommendations readily – at first instance.But I have since checked my records again there was something – some other correspondence that I would have omitted and I think that the commission – The Chair will appreciate that I am sitting with about 200 complicit and given time so those mistakes do happen.  But it does not really change the whole complexion of what I would have written in my affidavit. I however request your permission that I read something here so that I clarify that once step that I saythat I would have jumped.    Thank you very much.  And may I continue?  So we – we have written to the Minister with the findings and recommendations but she then wrote to us and although she was not saying that the appointment was regular she raised about three points and we accepted them as includes because when you are doing investigations you want to also give them an opportunity to input into that investigation.  So we accepted that but the following points were raised in herletter and this was on the 27 t h of February 2020 where she    That is correct Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct.    That is correct to date.    It is a generally accepted practice amongst intelligence services that sometimes they will want to identify intelligence officers at an early stage.  They could visit high schools, they could go to the universities and start recruiting there.  And what they have done here is that in certain instances they will identify the so called underprivileged or previously disadvantaged students or individuals they will give them a bursary and then they willgo and study with already a commitment at that stage the they will be absorbed into the agency once they complete that.Same principle with the cadet program as well.  So they have done a lot on that.  Like a single cadet programcould have around thirty or even more students who will be taken to the college.  We would not have a problem of that it is a good practice accepted.  The only problem is that they do not have a criteria which says what are the requirements basic or otherwise that these cadets or students should you know comply with and that is creating a serious problem because there is    The problem is that more often than not wehave stumbled across or in fact we found that there would familial relations between people who are appointed between them and the political principles and in certain instances also with senior managers within the State Security Agency.    For us it is nepotism and – and we cannot really deal with that issue satisfactorily until we know which criteria was used to identify that.   They are examples of nepotism.  We decided to – to remove about two names.    For the reasons of the time – the pressures of time Chairperson and we are also trying to limit the notices that would have sent.  But in the – in the documents that will be declassified and transmitted to yourself you will see the names, the surnames and that relationship.   It is in the documents that I have submitted to the commission already.    That is a problem and I think I would have raised it earlier as well to say that they become beholden to the appointing authorities and they are ingratiated in a particular manner because some of them will tell you that I did not expect this you know.  Just imagine how easy it is Chairperson if I get identified I am given a bursary, I get appointed but our neighbours child who may even be more qualified than myself is not getting considered for thatposition.  It is obvious that I will be beholden to the appointing authority.    That is correct.  We would not be able to establish that because each time we request the assist – the criteria they say we do not have the criteria.    It is frequent practice Chairperson.  In fact when I was driving – drafting the affidavit and I wanted that documentary proof I was given a list of about forty.    Cadets yes.    And – and at that particular point I am informed reliably that the then Minister of State Security Minister Kasrils I am not implicating him so I think I canmention the name he actually disowned those students because he said that when he was going through the list he could pin point exactly that Minister, that other former Minister, that other Minister.    That other DG, that Deputy.    DG.    So he disowned about forty graduates on a cadet or a cadet program.  The other ones it was actually two students who had gone to university but then the reason why I focused on that it is because they would have written to us now complaining in turn. But there were not placed on a level that they were promised before they went touniversity.  It is a very, very, very frequent you know issue at the Security – the State Security Agency.    I do not remember I think that we – we made that enquiry but it should have been included in that annual report.   If not they are planned.    For the so called 00   But we could not get kind of information so I do not know in any given year how many people are they targeting to recruit.    Ja I will not be – I will not have any intelligence – intelligent you know response to that.    I – work that out.    Maybe safe to indicate that it is also happening loosely in that …    In that you will get and I write – I write thenames of the Ministers you will get Minister David Masobo who will visit a particular high school in KZN and then he identifies maybe three or four students.  You will get the then Deputy Minister I mentioned her name Ms Molekane who will go to a high school in – and I am exchangingprovinces here to the North West and identify two that we have that particular information. And then you will have the Director General then who will have a program of about thirty or forty at any given time them being sent on this cadet current program.  So it has happened because there is no criteria.  Other people are going and where we are sitting now we may even be oblivious to some of those cases.    That is correct.    It is an observation that we – we confirm and – and maybe can I give a final example of what happened in terms of the executive overreach?  And this is the matter that we are dealing with – with now.Now the specifications starts writing a submission and that submission appoints 26 managers – now it is senior managers they use their own levels there but I think that in the public service it would be your directors and –because they are also general managers who could be equivalent to chief directors and so forth.Now this is the chase that is confirmed but what happens there is that they did not advertise it. There is no selection panel. There are no interviews. Some of those people do not meet the requirements of that particular post.  The DDG – I mean the DG the acting DG that even refused to recommend because he is writing his concerns about how these people were identified.  26 Chairperson managers and the only thing that you find in that submission is that theyhave a blog where they write their motivation.  One example of that motivation is that this person used to act in the particular position and he is a loyal member for years and he has experience on that particular field and so forth.  And then they got appointed.  Some ofthem and what the DG wrote under the comments is that some of them were even recalled from retirement and then they were appointed – appointed – appointed again.There is no regulatory framework.  When you go through that particular submission they did not tell you    The way I see it Honourable Chairperson sorry – ja the way I see it, it is that the Minister was intending to come up with what we called a deviation.  So the regulations are in place and they could not code those regulations because regulations says you advertise, you come up with a selection criteria, selection panel and then you follow those steps.That is what their own regulations are saying.  So – so they did not write any of those there.  The only reasonthat they provided under the motivation is that there is a huge number of managers who have either resigned, went on retirement.  In fact coming up with what one could see as an emergency recruitment.  So in my career I have only heardabout emergency procurement when there is a burst pipe somewhere and so forth. But I have never ever heard of an emergency recruitment.    That is correct Chairperson.    Ja no in that case they do not have and I will request the Chairperson to delineate the two that I was talking about.   The latest example that I was referring to is people who are long in the service.    Now that are appointed into managementpositions.    I had exhausted…    At least (talking over one another) time – there is cadets and the students.    That is correct Chairperson.   It does not have and that is what we have been requesting.    Even if it is a policy which this was the criteria.    To be considered.   They do not have that Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct.    And in that instance there are regulations.    Which deals with that but they get ignored.   Completely.    In the latter example.    The acting DG refused to recommend.    But the Minister went ahead and approved.   26.   Managers.    Minister Ayanda Dlodlo.    They are yet to get their 00   That is correct Chairperson.    Yes.    I do not want to give you conspiracy theories.    I did not want to give you that.   Chairperson.    Alright.  And I – I think with one of those appointments there was a media opinion.  There was an opinion in the media.  Those people are connected majority of them are connected to the previous management.  The management that would have worked with Mr Arthur Fraserduring that time.  People are able to appoint and – and     During that period.  That is correct, yes.     That is correct.     ...talk about promotion.     So during Pan 1, they would have been in a level below, the level that are pointed to now.     That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct.     I confirm that, Chairperson.    The approval of the minister.  So the minister is the last signatory and it will be written, like, on the submission to say that recommend, not recommend that.  So it will be the other signatories.  You will get an HR official somewhere but the last part there it is approved or not approved.  And the minister - the appointments happened under the approval of the minister.    Exactly what I am saying that involvement of the minister in the recruitment process constitutes significant executive overreach and this is not – cannot not be seen as my opinion only because it is also contained in the HLRP.     That is correct.  Yes, Chair.    And I am still shocked, even today, Chairperson.  But what happened is that when my staff members go and do what we can call, like, verification, like, when they visit these offices, I, sometimes I accompany them and we will deal with or we will have a meeting on the first day and then I will leave them becausesometimes they will work there for a week or so.So in this specific meeting I was sitting there with the Provincial Head, Major General Makele, and I     That is the complaint that I received.  May I please paint a this by using an alphabet, if you will allow me Chairperson.  Now you will have A and A is a head of Counterintelligence.  And then you will have B who is a head of Surveillance.  Now because this group falls under this other group of B, for instance, they will then provide information only to B so that B could appear moresuccessful than A.  So they will be sitting there, and I am just being careful because this is one of the networks that they are doing but let me use a similar or simplistic example.  Let us say they are responsible for listening to conversations and they come across, for instance, people who are blaming to commit cash-in-in-transit heist, for instance.Instead of giving that information to A, they will not do that but they would rather give it to B because B was on their side and would have influenced theirappointment.  So that kind of a competition also exists and which poses a serious problem then because it means that the other people may not even come across that information.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Yes.  And Chairperson, yes, I think that I need to stand by confirming that indeed we would have removed specific transactions because amongst your witnesses I think that Ms K detailed all those.  We do havealso a detailed list of money-flows.  What I can confirm is that money has been stolen and we are talking lots and lots of money taken with suitcases, others being lost and people were never really held accountable for that money.  And what I am saying there is that our findingsare that these monies have been used for other things that, in fact, could affect our National Security adversely.  For an example, some of those monies could be used to fuel political tensions.  There is evidence in our possession that some of those monies were used to finance a particular faction within in the governing party and in other jurisdiction you will find that these monies can be used also to finance terrorism.       They do contain itemised, Chairperson.  Itemised, you know...  Ja, the items which indicate at what stage was this amount taken and what reason was given, and I even attached examples of what could be seen an invoice.  In other words, reporting that the recipient would have received the money.     That is correct.  I confirm that.     Yes.  And I also referred them to that.  I think...  Okay.  I am aware, Chairperson, that during the evidence of Ms K you were shown an example of a Word document.  So I take the money and say that I am taking this money to Josef.  Josef could be a source or he could have done certain work for us.  And what I do is that I only type.  I, the undersigned, confirm that I have received this particular money.  And then there is just a signature.  No letterhead, no nothing and so forth and they are taking huge amounts of money.  One of the transactions wasequivalent to 200 000 Euros at a call(?).     Even eighteen.  It is eighteen.     It is around eighteen.     It runs into millions.       It runs into millions.    At that time that I was doing that calculation.     To be – what I find at that particular point.  I know it is fluctuating but it was R 2.7 million.     Yes.  That was taken by a member and it just got lost, just like that.     Not at all, Chairperson.     That is correct.  And also to add thatmanagers deliberately or being unaware attempt to misconstrue secrecy and allow the commission to use cash, to mean that then it is no accountability.  There must be an authority somewhere where you go and account.  So they see that kind of a thing to say that once you say thatyou can use cash, then it means that you can – you may not, in fact, account it for and that is what is happening.     That is correct, Chairperson but they will never ever be able.  None – all intelligence service willneed to use cash in certain instances.     [Indistinct]      That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct.  That is our proposition, Chairperson.    Yes but we would have investigated them.  So what we include in our certificates.  Remember – that Ireferred to last time.     Yes.  It will basically be findings not value(?).  So we would have received a report and we would get into the system and check whether all thatmoney indeed went out and we will check whether there was some kind of invoice or settlement of that particular money.     So what I list in the certificate will be our findings to say that this X amount of money went outside and we do not have proof that it was really received by the intended recipient.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     First it would be the minister responsible for that particular service.  In other words, Minister Bheki Celewill get on behalf of the police of SAP-CI.  Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula will get on behalf Defence Intelligence, and Minister Ayanda Dlodlo will get on behalf to the State Security Agency.  That is the first authority.The second authority will be the Head ofServices.  So it will the DG and the Divisional Head’s Commissioner.  In the case of SAP-CI, it will be Chief Defence Intelligence Officer in that right(?) chain(?).  The third authority will be the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.     You understand me correctly.     The previous committee never acted.  Never acted on this.     The one or the other reason that was provided at a particular point was that they want to reallyachieve(?) the separation of powers.  For them they saw these as the decisions which happened with them, the executive realm.  And I do not know to what extent they were intended to hold those executives, you know, to account but as far as I know is that I was never reallyprovided a reason, a convincing reason.  Let me say that.  I was never convinced as to the reason why they could not act.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct.     No, not – I can say and submit to the Chairperson that no they – that is not sufficient their oversight role.       No, Chairperson I can say confidently ...[intervenes]     ...that their oversight was never adequate.     The reason why I say I am confident about it is that it is also a finding of the HLRT(?) ...[intervenes]     But I think that there is evidence before this Commission, as it were ...[intervenes]      ...to say that Parliamentary oversight was not adequate.     My preference was to confine this to my term of office.     Because I think that even officials(?) will tell you that it is I have been there for a sufficient time to then be able to formulate an opinion.     But also formulate or identify a particularpattern.     So, I mean, I have been there now for four years ...[intervenes]      So I confined myself to my – office.     My predecessor was Advocate Faith Radebe, the late.     Yes.     Yes, I am writing about – it is a five yearterm.     Ja.     That is correct.     That is correct.     I think in my earlier paragraph here, I have written which years exactly.     But 2010 sounds more probable.     Certificates.     That is correct, Chairperson.     No, but I will know ...[intervenes]      ...by implication.     Because there is continuance in the office.     It is only the Inspector General of Intelligence who gets appointed who comes and go.     The rest of the staff and very senior people including investigators are always there.    Now during my first year in the office and when I started dealing with my first certificate there was reference made or recommendations that remained unimplemented and were coming from the tenure of Advocate Faith Radebe.       There are many examples.  Examples of that.  In fact, the so-called Rogue Unit at SARS and so forth.  I still had to deal with that issue after I have takenoccupancy of that office.  So I will have a group of certificates which will show what my predecessor sent to the committee but those problems would still be applicable under my term of office.     Like, for instance, the one that I am writing there.   Inadequate controls relating to the use and flow of money in the Intelligence Services.  You will find those things also under the certificates that were drafted or that were signed before I assumed the office.    I think my submission, Chairperson, was to say that our recommendations are just being ignored willy-nilly.     And we touched on the PAN 1 Investigation.  If I can make the specific example.  And I am using this example to submit to the Commission that it is doable.  Itis an exercise that I think that if I go back to the office I can readily ...[intervenes]      ...identify so say that...[intervenes]      ...this has been a problem for time ...[intervenes]      Or since the establishment of this particular office.    Let us take an example of what one of my staff members would be writing an affidavit about that I discussed and I think it is in here.  Now, the former Minister Mahlobo says that he was not aware that Mr Arthur Fraser was implicated in the PAN Investigation.  And I went to the office because the Commission wanted us to confirm whether there were some presentations made to the minister with regard to the PAN Investigation.  So the same recommendations in the PANInvestigation was that people should be judged(?), for instance.  So that is exactly what – it is a classic example and I think an accurate example of saying or being able to furnish(?) the Commission that it is a doable exercise to go there and say that these were the findings before even myoccupancy of the office and they were never ever implemented.       In law, I do not think that ...[indistinct]      ...therefore ask as – in terms of oversight body.     Because that is what I was saying and I was saying that I think that we do have a good model to say are these remedial measures, we know that they are not.  But I was even saying to yourself that I wish that we had the resources because I was going to take myself to court and say that I do not think that any legislature will have an intention to put so money into this organisation but then recommendations are just being ignored.     Yes, that was what I said.    These were findings and I write there, I say this is clearly absurd because what came to our attention was that - in the 3.6 million, there is a gentlemen on anoperation to Jupiter, this other planet and he comes back and says but I lost it, they have taken it or I misplaced it or whatever but then he does not even create serious attention or, you know, serious attention because he then tells that I have lost it and you deduct it from my salary.   In fact the gentleman went on an early retirement during the course of 2020 and others, who will know, that their pensions will not even get to that particular amount and in this instance he just came back and said that oh, I have no reasons, I have lost it and please start deductingit and so forth.  I am told that that money – and they would have attached his pension if not part thereof.  Now this is a problem and it came in the analysis of our evidence.  If Now if I got 3.6 million and I went and bought a property I will be saving about another 100% because if I am buying a property for R3.6 million and it is bonded, I am going to end up paying about R7 million but if I buy it cash and I say that no, no, you can buy that money from my pension it means that I would have received and interest free loan to do other things.   That is the firstexample.The second example of R9 million in the finding, also, this person is a protector.  He is a protector who accompanies a principal when he travels both internationally and locally and our findings is that thisperson could not have pulled this mission alone because it is very easy.  If I am not travelling overseas but you get my protector coming to claim money that they would have travelled.  It should be well-know but no, no, no but he did not apply, you know, to go to this and other country and so forth.  So it happened over a period of time until he reached an amount of R9 million.   Inadequate controls and there is an argument about that because other people will say absence of internal controls.  No, in this instance controls are there but theyare being ignored as well.     Three years on average, a travel of three years.     That is correct, Chairperson, yes.     It also tallies with the usage of cash.  I willnever understand why do they give me cash when I travel outside the country, I just do not know, because it is even risky, I am called Inspector General Intelligence, I am not collecting intelligence, I am not doing anything, I am oversight body.  But believe you me, when I travel theygive me that kind of cash.  So when I come back normally I will return some.     I beg your pardon?     No, it will not run into millions, ja.     Yes.     I confirm that, Chairperson.     I am saying that they were used to fuel or finance a particular – I mean, a particular faction depending on who is taking that money.  Our finding in that regard is not one-sided at all.     That is correct, Chairperson.       It will be in the certificates.ADV PRETORIUS     That is correct.     That is correct, Chairperson.     It is certificate – I think that I used the word report interchangeably there.     That is correct.      Would you not like me just in one or two sentences explain why I would have used the word report over there?  So over and above the certificates, I also do what is called monitoring reports.  Now monitoring report, I may change just one subject because the certificates will run – will deal with issues, a variety of these sort of issues but in this instance I may decide to do a monitoring on procurement maybe of software, for instance, and just writethat particular issue and then I will send to a responsible minister.      They will then go to parliament because a certificate is a culmination of your review reports monitoring reports, outcome of investigations.     So even if I would have sent only this subject right in the middle of every reporting year it willthen be found in the certificate as well.     I will do that, Chairperson.     I say    It was that although the control measures are there, they need to be tightened a little bit because some of them were too old.    Old for my liking, in any event even the secretary’s account I think it was 1957 or so.     Maybe too old.  Ja, but my intention was to say that they could be a little bit old, just too old for our liking and that …[intervenes]     Yes but my quagmire is that times will differ.     So they would have amended one out of fifteen.  Maybe in 2009 they would have, you know, adjusted three or four in 2014 and so forth.  That is why I cannot use an umbrella weight that too old..    For us, yes.     That is correct, Chairperson, but I also said in this instance that they must be both preventative and deterrent.     That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     We address them to a Chairperson.     Previously it was – no, there is a previous committee, the immediate previous one, it was Mr Nqakula, who then was transferred to the Presidency as State Security Adviser and during that particular time there wasan acting Chairperson, Mr Ganebe and we then also – okay, ja, Mr Ganebe acted for a while.  With the current one is honourable Maake ADV PRETORIUS     That is correct, Chairperson.     I would not address any formal letter to any other person except for the Chairperson but I cannot rule out that there could have been a discussion between myself and one of the members because they also had anopen line to myself.  In fact one of the people that I remember raising these issues with is General Bantu Holomisa because he was sitting in the previous committee but apart from that, there is also a Chief Whip, a Deputy Chief Whip in parliament that I also have that kind of an open line.  So we would have had those discussions about these issues.     That is correct, Chairperson.     General Holomisa said that he is aware – normally he will sort of give me counsel, such as you have to be strong, we are aware that you are doing your work and perhaps he could have promised me that he will see how he would nudge, you know, the Chairpersons or the committee itself in its entirety to really implement these things because all these people that I would have, youknow, talked to, they were aware of the rot that was dipping especially in the State Security Agency but also in Crime Intelligence, so they were not oblivious to those.Can I say that there is an interview that was done by one of the current members, Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi whosaid in that interview on TV that he is aware that we are doing what we are supposed to be doing but the failure is at the point of implementation by the committee itself.     That is my submission, Chairperson.     They are all in my reports, Chairperson.    Not at all because, to confirm that, I would submitted the certificates in a redacted version for the Chairperson.  All what I removed was methods that they use, sources but I also removed organisational weaknesses.  But in terms of the transactions I made it a point that the Commission, you know, becomes aware.     That is correct, Chairperson.     No, there would not be problems because I deal with administrative issues.       With regard to procurement, for instance.     And I think I will make submission earlier orlater to say that there is generally over classification and it done to hide malfeasance.     So I have worked on the certificates to an extent but I am satisfied that they can be made public also.     That is the reason why I would removed the other issues.     Thank you, Chair.     I have considered that position.  It is in fact my administrative decision that I said to the co-functionaries that I consulted with to say that there are two levels of disclosure here.  The first disclosure is to yourself, Chairperson, and maybe I also mean the legalteam.   The second disclosure is then to the public.     Yes, I give an example of that and I usedthe word looting deliberately because pure looting.  Yes, of course, there are investigations that are taking place.  We were also promised that the Crime Intelligence itself will conduct its own internal investigation.  To date we are aware of about two members who are dismissed.  I thinkthat they have appealed and so forth based on those findings.Now what was happening there and I am giving an example later, is that we were even calling the subordinates their runners.  What would happen is that a Chief Financial Officer based at Crime Intelligence will be involved in operations.  An example of an operation here is that he will handle a source and it is not acceptable but because he cannot go and claim money for that particular source, he will use a Captain or a Colonel or a WarrantOfficer somewhere because he will be a Major General.  So a poor Captain will go, collect money, give it to the CFO, the CFO will then claim that I would have paid a source and the settlement will then be done on behalf of the Captain not on behalf of the person claims that they are actually real handlers of the particular person.  So we are calling them runners, that these senior managers will then have these other people.     That is correct, Chairperson.      That is correct, Chairperson.     Yes, he would just return and give him something and say that I have given to the person that I have given so he can go back and [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     That is correct, Chairperson.  And during the investigation what was also surprising is that – I think that we have an affidavit, I stand to be corrected, here by the staff members in my office, but many instances where a subordinate will tell us that I did not have any proof that the money was given to a source, I do not even know who that source is.     Not at all.    Yes, that is what the account will say.     That is correct, Chair.     I do not know I will – I will not be discussing the method here.     But a source could be somebody at a different rank.     Yes, it is somebody that takes a rank, ja, it is not a police official.     It could be somebody that …[intervenes]    That I saw when this thing was happening.     That is correct.    Yes.     That is correct, Chairperson.     No, you I misunderstood me there.     And it is very critical that I explain.     Now the CFO instructs the subordinate to go to accounts department and collect money there.     And the reason that he is using there is to say that you know that I have …[intervenes]     A responsibility to handle a source.     So this money that I am taking from you is for a source.     But it never goes to the source himself, he gives it to the CFO.     Yes.     And then the CFO tells him that no, do not worry, I am going to give to the source.    Yes, that is the claim by him.     They know, the CFO knows, the subordinate knows.     Yes.  That is why we are calling themrunner because I think that there was a suggestion by the evidence that they could have been getting some kickbacks.     But we did not have that – because whywould you go there?       Because when questions are asked, they will not be posed to the CFO, they will posed to yourself as a real handler, as you claimed.     That is correct.     That is what our proposition is.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct.     That is correct.     Although we would not have concreteevidence to say that they were getting kickbacks and that is why I am using this word selectively of a runner.     But he is aware that in terms of the prescripts that is not allowed.     And if he was oblivious to that, he would ask the CFO as to why do you not go straight there?     So this is an activity of a person who is fullyaware that the CFO cannot handle a source.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     These are finding, Chairperson.     The details.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is the general principle, the general rule.     That will be my response, but there is a rider to that.  That last sentence does not refer to us.  It does not refer to the investigations conducted by the officeof the Inspector-General of Intelligence.  I do not know.  I may have – it sounds as if that is the submission but it is not a submission.  When I say investigations cannot be concluded, now I am referring to criminal investigations and we have got instances such as those.     In our chains they do not have a right to withhold any information.     Whether classified or not.    We always give to others.  So our investigations in the specific case will be concluded, but the other investigations that follows will be hampered by refusal to declassify.     So I am referring to investigations such as those conducted by IPID, for instance, and those maybe conducted by the Hawks.     It is widely known and I think that it is laughable.  In fact, the team have always laughed about it.  Maybe I should just explain what happened with this specific one.     Now, the SSA wanted to develop a regulation which will sort of put into effect the provision of the missed documents.  Now we decided that we should have our own document in the regulation which takes thatposition which states it cannot classify documents to hide malfeasance.  But guess what they do, Chairperson?  The very same reason they classify it as secret.     There is another dimension to that, Chairperson.  Now, I am just imagining that if it was myself and I contravened the same regulation and that they wanted to ask me questions.  Let’s say we are an operating and over-classified and they said oh, but you have contravened that.  My response will be that once you classify and say that you will apply a principle of need-to-know, so which means that I may not have been considered as a person who should be aware of that particular ...  AndI can easily say that was classified.  I did not have access to it.  So you are defeating your own purpose, your own objective by ensuring that people do not over classify because they will say but I am not aware of that.     Yes, but over and above that their management – divisional management of Crime Intelligencealso promised us that they are going to deal with these issues and they are going to refer them to law enforcement agencies, because our recommendation would be that here is a clear case of criminality, so please refer it.  We do not want to replace the management of these agencies.  We can only flag and point out to where malfeasance, especially criminality, would have taken place.     That is correct, Chairperson.  And I thinkthat they would have developed an access path for me if I did have to do that, I mean, into the courts.  I could be at the Magistrate's Court and the other courts every day of my life because of the level of malfeasance in those particular ...     That is correct, Chairperson.     Alright.       Yes, it is another - it is another form.  And maybe I can use an example of what happened there.  So they would have told us that they procured and ...[indistinct].  Chairperson, I do not want – because it will be names of companies normally.  But on Advocate Pretorius's laptop he will have, like, for an example antispyware in that.  So normally he will – you will pay a certain licence fee.  So they bought something along those lines in the region of millions and the intention of thatparticular licence was to protect the principles within the environment – within the management so that their gadgets could not be easily intercepted by foreign, you know, agents and so forth. But now what we found – because I went there personally again.  What we found is that, in fact, the licence itself or the software was never delivered and the investigators in my office were actually tipped that it was never delivered and it was about to expire.  So normally you will pay it for a period of 12 months.  But when wewent there we satisfied ourselves that it was supposed to be still there and we requested that we should be taken there so that we can observe it.  And there was a confirmation that it was not available.  It was never delivered.    That is correct.  They buy non-existent things.     That is the only inference I think that one could make.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct.  I confirm that, Chairperson.     Well, the general came back that they useand there is a second gentleman who is appearing before a court in Centurion ...[indistinct] so it is in the public domain.     But a grabber is an equipment that can beplaced within a particular radius and it will be able to create a tower.  But there are side issues.  But it will create a tower.  So, in other words, when I call the Chairperson you will have the other line, so that machinery will be, like, between myself, so call it eavesdropping, because that particular person that is not really prevent my communication to reach you but the only effective ability of hearing the conversation between myself and the Chairperson.     That is correct, ja, including it goes to the extent of emails as well.     So let us say digital communication in general.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Alright.       Okay.  However, we use the names that we will have used.  I think it is very important to refresh the Chairperson's memory to say that there was this gentleman called – that we called Ivani here.    Yes.  Who is a director of a company called IDI.  So this person is the person who accompanied a group of other people to go investigate ...[indistinct].  He is the same person now, but he is appearing under the other circumstances.  Now, just days before the NASREC conference I received a call from Mr Mbindwane, Mr Bongani Mbindwane.  He was given notice.  I am aware of that, Chairperson.  And at that time he was the advisor to the then Minister of Police, Mr Fikile Mbalula.  And what heinforms me is that, "There is an urgent issue that I want to discuss with you."  And obviously he was telling me that he is sent by the minister, but I really have to impress upon the Commission that the minister never requested me to attend that particular meeting but I went there.  And thenwhen we met at that particular place he told me that there was a group of backpackers who wanted to influence the conference, the outcome of the conference, the NASREC conference, and ...     He called them backpackers.       Yes.     Well, they use that concept in criminology and so forth, but it will be, like, people who will claim to be tourists, for instance, so they are known to have those backpacks, you know.  It may be full of cameras and so forth.     Mr Chairperson, that is how you describe that group of people who were said to be coming from a foreign country and they were, you know, littered around Soweto.  So he told me that the biggest challenge that theyhave is that the then acting divisional commissioner of ...[indistinct] did not want to procure the grabbers.  He said that they were actually in need of grabbers to the region of R210 million.  However, because the date was too close they could settle for one grabber at a tune of R45 million. He explained, like, you know, the idea.  This is how it works.  These are the capabilities so do not be surprised that it is so expensive.  An ordinary grabber costs around R7 million.   But the reason why he called me was to say that the divisional commissioner was scared or did not want to purchase because I was conducting some investigation with the previous procurement.  And I felt so bad.  I said how could they want to use my name and if something terrible really happened it will seem as if, you know, I wasinvolved in that, hence I promised him that I will go to the divisional commissioner and change it.  "No, no, do not worry.  If there is a threat and so forth, leave.  Continue.  Manage the organisation and make decisions."  And that is what I did.  I left there immediately and I went to see the divisional commissioner.  I know I am taking long, but I think it is important to do this. When I got to where the divisional commissioner was he was not at his headquarters.  He was there at the other place.  We met.  So we will normally meet in a room,so he had ...[indistinct] room.  We did not even get to sit down, because the divisional commissioner then asked me, "Are you aware of the company that they want me to procure from?"  I said, "No, he did not tell me."  And he mentions this company, IDI, and I immediately said that,"No, no, but he was not honest with me, hence I am no longer getting involved in this particular issue."  "Then I understand why you do not want to procure."  And that is where we ended on that day, claiming, the divisional commissioner that, "No, no, I was coming to permit you or somehow tell you that I will not stand in front of any procurement."  But in this instance I am no longer getting involved.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct.     That is correct, Chairperson.  But we also as the office of the OIGI we are involved in keeping the IPID.  In fact, a senior manager from my office was working with a senior manager from IPID, because we hadinformation and I am calling it information, not evidence, information to say that the rest of the money will be used to buy votes at NASREC.     That is correct.  And it sounded probable.  That's when we interrupted or intervened, because the grabber's original price or average price would be R7 million, but here in this case they wanted R45 million to buy only one grabber.     That is correct, Chairperson.  Maybe I should also mention that I stopped somewhat about this procurement, but there was a subsequent meeting again that took place in front, Chair.    Alright.  Now, after withdrawing – telling the divisional commissioner that I will not get involved in this because I did not make those decisions, I then received a WhatsApp message that I am attaching the documents that will be coming from Mr Bo Mbindwane, saying that, "AG, I had thought that we agreed on a particular position."  And my understanding is that that WhatsApp message came as a result of the Divcom, the divisional commissioner, tellingMr Mbindwane that, "No, no, that guy did not, you know, agree or he did not want to get involved in this particular process."  And then I said that, "I will settle then for a tripartite meeting, because I spoke to you alone.  I went somewhere else and I got a different story, so let us meet."  And yes, of course subsequently we met here in Sandton and again I reiterated that I do not get involved in procurement by any of the services, as long as they procure in accordance with the applicable prescripts, whether applicable with any other legislation that regulatesprocurement.  And I ended up in leaving that particular meeting and they give ...[indistinct] behind with Mr Mbindwane.     He was involved.  That is ...     No, he should not have.  He is a ministerial special advisor.  Even the minister, I mean, for that matter never really gets involved in ...  That is exactly what they tell us.  And in this instance I have to be very clear that even Minister Mbalula has never, ever discussed this matter with myself.  It was the advisor who was pushing for this.     I investigated it though they were never ...[indistinct].     They didn't even know that there was a process to a trial and a purchase of this particular equipment.     And – sorry, sorry.  This could be very much important to say that if I'm hacking surveillance in crime intelligence journals, they call me end user.  In other words, I am the one who initiates the process, who go to the procurement people and tell them that I am in need ofthese three bottles of water and then they will conduct their own research, source the prices and then buy.  So I am an end user.  I must initiate.  It cannot be initiated anywhere else.      It is correct and that is the reason why I said that information should not be misconstrued for evidence.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Yes, it was under investigation and there was also litigation with regard to that particular matter, in fact, yes.  There was a finding per se – I mean, a judgment which states that those documents must be declassified.     That is correct.     Not at that stage.    Before the court case, yes.     The investigation could not even take off as far as I know, because there was an application by police management, including Mr Mbindwane, to say that IPID cannot have access.  And I think that interdict was, youknow, issued until there was an appeal or a review as far as that decision was concerned, yes.     We know a lot more now.  But even at thatstage as the office we knew more than what IPID knew because we were in possession of these documents.     Yes, our office also got involved in the investigation of that particular matter.  Remember that I always say, Chairperson, that the other agents cannot stop the investigation on our behalf or at our instance, because we are reporting to different authorities.  So IPID was conducting a criminal investigation.  We were conducting,if you'd like, oversight investigation.     It will be in the certificate, this one, because it is a 2017 matter, so it will be in the 2017/2018.     That is correct.  Yes, that is correct.     No, there was not a response as far as that is concerned.  But I think that even the ANC members in that committee were really concerned and worried about what I have reported ...[indistinct].     Ja, the concerns.  So it will be during the deliberations, during presentation when they started comments and so forth to say that this is worrisome that it is actually happening.     That is correct.  I did that, Chairperson.     Ja, they are.     I do not think I clearly understand your question, Chairperson.     Okay.  Now ...     The other part then happens in the public domain.    It displayed itself, so I do not have reservations informing the committee what happened thenabout this.     I think two issues that I want to mention, Chairperson.     Now, during the time that it was reported in the public domain there was an expression by senior ANC officials who are not even in Parliament to say that this is worrisome and these monies are used to fuel the factions.     Yes.  In the ANC and some of them were also worried to say that to what extent can Intelligence be involved in the internal for that event, because that is an internal ANC event, it is not a government – government event.    There is confirmation that officials of Crime Intelligence were even removed from NASREC and they were told to go a little bit far because they were causing problems for that particular conference, but now after the Court decision this issue came to the fore again, and now there are two incorrect narratives that have been created about this particular issue. That the declassification of the documents revealed two things that General Sithole never signed theprocurement of this grabber of R45million.  The second issue that we lost the declassification is that General Sithole kept on telling the – my other managers, the management that you can do this as long as you comply with procurement prescripts.   So he kept saying those two things but the problem is that the narrative that was being built, whilst this was declassified was that General Sithole signed the submission and that he could have allowed a deviation, but it never really reached a particular stage. The other issue which is very important and critical to National Securities, but it is in the public domain, again, where Minister Cele accused or said that this grabber with the R45million was also - could also have been used to intercept the emails of the then Deputy President of theANC but that event took place way before we were involved in that investigation, way before this attempted procurement.  So those are the issues, the narratives that are incorrect, and they've played themselves out now in the public domain.     That is correct, Chairperson.     Yeah, so this is the general and similarprinciple that they procure irregularly and sometimes goods are not delivered, the problem that I have expressed.  But here let's say that they change the tact, they changed modus operandi. In this instance they call for quotations and whenwe analysed these quotations, there were certain facts, which came to the fore.  The first one being that the font the manner, the structure of the quotations was actually similar. The other concern or what we established was that one of the companies that provided one of the quotations was not even involved on this, they told us that they are an HR consultancy company, and they say that they have never even sold an equipment of that particular nature.     Oh, ja.     Alright now…[intervene]    Yes, I see that look CSIR is a government entity.  It is something on those lines and the researchers there will develop some of the solutions for even for State information technology agencies or for other governmentdepartments.  So in this instance, they had offered the Crime Intelligence that we could develop this kind of IT solution for yourselves, and it was going to be at around R7million but now that offer was then ignored and SUB-CI then called for the other potential over and above what CSIR would have offered them.     For R33million now this time around.     That is correct Chairperson I did that and I visited personally with members of my office, visited.     We discovered that it was never delivered to Crime Intelligence.      That is correct Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.     It is procured in inverted commas, moniesare paid.     That is correct Chairperson.     I could not be shown a replacement as well,Chairperson.     Pure theft.     That is correct Chairperson.     I am arguing always argue that you cannot over classify this issue, just a pure procurement issue.  There is nothing National Security about it, there is nothing Intelligence about it, it is like procuring a car.     Yes, but it is the same company now, thiscompany gets involved in all these kinds of procurement, which I can supplies him and irregular instances not even getting delivery but in this instance that system - oh, but on the paragraph I am talking about flouting of their procurement regulations again.     That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct Chairperson.     I submit that Chairperson.     Yes, that is correct.      Yes, so in the instance where I saidChairperson, that an end user will be somebody who is responsible for that particular thing.  So if you say that it is a voice encryption, if you say it is a grabber and we are looking at some body as surveillance, you know, and all those an issues, but the end user will be somebody somewhere.     That is correct Chairperson.      They were not genuine and as I say the paragraph that we picked up some of the other thing, for example, in one of those, there was no VAT number, V-A-Tnumber and it was also apparent that the latter two quotations were for purposes of creating fictitious competition, also referred to as cover quoting, in contravention of their applicable Treasury regulations.     Those were my findings, because the name of the director of Company B was also the director of Company C.     That is correct Chairperson.      Yes, yes.     Yes, and I might need to on paragraph 148, that I am not executing that failure only to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.  I am saying that we have failed also as the OIGI and I think that I would have provided reasons what I think were the reasons behind that because we were weakened and all those other things but the failure there of oversight over this organisation is also attributable to us as the office.     That is correct Chairperson.      It is related and I think that is where previously I said to the Chairperson that no one and no one within this fraternity should come to you and misleadyou that we were not aware of this because on paragraph 149 I am dealing with the certificates and I am also referring to what I would have sent, and I think that I am also attaching the letters that will accompany those certificates to the Joint Committee on Intelligence.    I confirmed that Chairperson.     That is correct Chairperson.      It is because Chairperson I mean, if you get an office and you get appointed, there is an expectation that you should come up with a turnaround general strategy and without deviating looking at any reasons tojustify that I am glad to say that maybe we could even have pushed more than this.     And I know the attitude of the Chairperson I have heard you saying, telling other people we willnormally say that, but what did you do with the little that you had?      So I should not come here and say that we melt down, we have really got broken down, to me I see that as a failure of the OIGI.     And then there is an example, which further elucidate that Chairperson    That is correct Chairperson but for instance, over this four years I have struggled to get information, when in fact, the oversight act criminalises a refusal by any person in decent physical services and I always, you know, wanted to regard that as a last resort.  So that is – this is an example of a lapse on our side and because it does not need money, it needs me to cross the roads, the nearest police station, open a case and not wait, not write four letters before I can get one signal as an information.  So we should not be myopic, about the challengesfacing the office we could have done more.     I have done with the litigation that I would have referred to earlier.     That is correct Chairperson, there is this legal issue that I think that maybe during the arguments, the closing arguments maybe the legal team will deal with it because if a recommendation is developed and sent to their accounting officer for implementation, can we really bemoan the failure of the implementation and place it at the door of the legislature?  I think that that distinction should be made, I think that the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence should only hold the DG’s accountable, as to the extent that they fail to implement, because theseother issues are administrative decisions and so forth, which are a sole preview or province of the director, Director General's.  I do not know if the if that argument is raised whether it will be acceptable, but I did not want to venture into that myself.     That is correct Chairperson, I think that is what – not I think rather than to say that the majority of the recommendations will go to the accounting officers for implementation.     That is correct and I think that also in the spirit of legislation, you remember there is superintendence a role of the Ministers as well.  So in any event, if a decision is done, I have recommended to the DG the Minister is aware of that recommendation.  I think thather role eventually in that office superintendence so she has more powers to us the DG, why are you not implementing this?     Yes, that is that is my submission.    Yes I – may I please address the Chairperson on one point?    In less than a minute.  I did not – I know I am surprising the evidence leader I just deliberately did not want to discuss this issue with him.   I want to provide the commission with the date on which the submission was signed with regard to the 26 managers.    It just that – it is just that part.    It was signed on 6 March 2021.  Minister approved appointments on the 6 March 2021.    For the 26 appointments.    No, no it is an approval.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.    Yes on 6 March but on the 26 t h of March something happened there.    The – we have what we call a budget controller.    The budget controller wrote to the Minister and the DG – the acting DG then saying that most of theposts are not funded or were not funded so he was recommending that they should be put on hold until due diligence was completed.  But that was just …    A recommendation from the budget controller. What we are sitting with it is an approval which is signed on the 6t h of March.    6t h of March 2021.    In terms of the signatories the acting DG signs as a recommender.    So – so you will have a compiler Chairperson.    And then you will have maybe assessed level of recommendation.   Maybe from the HR person and then you will have the acting DG then who was supposed to recommend – he did not do it he raised some concerns and then you have got an approval by the Minister dated 6 March.   Yes. So what he did is that he scratch both sides.    And then he wrote – ja he wrote amended.    So which means that in other words why do we not say that he chose to – to abstain.   Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  He spoilt it.   He spoiled his ballot.    Yes the people are occupying as we know.    The positions.   Yes.    No we did not know that.  What we know isthat the Minister upon signing that she also made comments – handwritten comments and one of the comments there was that the concerns raised by the acting DG will be discussed between herself and the DG.    That is all what we know now.    That is an ideal.    And I think that the conclusion that I am able to draw now is that she appointed and in fact the recommendation of the budget controller was ignored.    That is correct.    It is the summary of the – of our submission Chairperson.   Yes I still stand by that contention.    And I can only explain it but we borrowed thatword from a constructive dismissal in terms of the labour relations you know legislation to say that on face value you cannot say it is a dismissal but it is you know done in such a manner that it could confuse other people.So what I mean is that in most cases we will still be given information but where there is refusal you will not get a letter which says that we will not give you that information.  Let me make an example.I will have a letter that – that will reach the commission at a later stage where I was requestinginformation with regard to the deployment of operatives at party political events for instance. And the letter that I got in response was to say that may you please explain how this request fall – falls under your mandate.  So I had to explain back to them to say that apart from monitoring and all those other issues I also have a function called investigation which includes maladministration which includes corruption but which also includes abuse of power.  Because at that stage I had received complain from one of the political parties who were saying that we do not even want this number ofintelligence operatives attending our events.  So – so constructive because they will not say that – we are not giving it to you but they will say explain to us how does it fit into your mandate.    That is correct Chairperson.    Yes Chairperson.  Can I mention Chairperson that this is my third year of completing an undergraduate degree in law and a LLB    Yes.  So I just decided to study that yes.    So I am not a lawyer but I do 00   Thank you Chairperson.    It is consistent with my findings Chairperson and I think that will also have submissions so affidavit in our possession where junior members says that I would have stolen this particular amount but it will just be a fraction of the amount stolen by somebody senior.  And they just get you know they just dismiss them in a short sort of time so there is a pattern there and it is our observation and finding.    Some of them may not take that angle.   In arguing they will almost admit – let us say they will confess.    And say that okay I am dismissed – I am here – I have stolen but there is somebody somewhere who it is known that they would have stolen more than myself but it is not – he is not saying that he should not have been dismissed.  They only say that our dismissal happened.    So quickly.    If compared to senior managers.    It is consistent with our findings Chairperson without mentioning names I think that the Chairperson will be aware that there is a former head of crime intelligence who is now convicted.  And there is a matter which is enrolledwhich happened more than ten years ago.  So you ask yourself why could you not just enrol this particular matter at that particular stage. But there is something again where we get – we get approached by some of there is this other captain who comes to us and he complains – he writes we have the file and he says I may have committed this particular crime and whatever however our preference – my preference is that it is you who should investigate us. So they know that we can only make recommendations and he even went to an extent because you ask them what kind ofrecourse or recommendation that you are wishing for and he says that if you have those powers could you please tell IPID that they did not have powers to investigate myself because    That will be another exception Chairperson.   That is correct.    You are correct.    You are – you are correct.    That is correct there is another case that wewere involved in and I think it is one of the enrolled matters now where one of the senior managers traded in his own personal vehicle there was a shortfall so he used the monies from a service from a particular service to pay for that particular shortfall and this case could not be concluded.  The investigation was concluded long time ago but they could not prosecute merely because that administrative part was classified also and it has always been hidden under information that on face value one may think that it is intelligence and it is not intelligence at all – it is a purecriminality and theft of state funds.    You could do that.  In the documents that I willbe submitted or that are in my bundle Chairperson which is not in front of us now is that I make an example of them purchasing groceries from one of the supermarkets that we all go to and they classify that particular submission.  Instead of just removing the house number and the address where these things will be taken to because it is a safe house yes.    It is available and it – they only write or wrote restricted.  Now restricted documents are not necessarily classified documents.    I confirm that that is our proposition Chairperson.   That is correct Chairperson and maybe one should hasten to add that what is a secret today may no longer – may not be a secret two weeks or two months to come you know.  So that is why it enjoins the head ofservices to keep on testing or retesting and identifying those that – those issues that should remain classified and those that need to be declassified.    That is still our submission Chairperson.    They do have that Chairperson.  There are often some internal arrangements such as if one of the investigators is still waiting for the re-vetting and so forth that they remove them from cases of that – of that nature.  But they are always alive to the requirement that only people with top secret should access these documents in crimeintelligence environment.  I think that is now happening also with the investigative directorate.  It is also happening with the Hawks as well to say that if you are waiting please step aside for a while until you are re-vetted.    They should not have been classified at all.  The matter is yet to be prosecuted because we have got the Centurion case number and the prosecutors could not proceed with that – with that issue.  Ten or so yes that is actually 2013 matter.   That is correct Chairperson it is over-classification because it is purchasing of blinds; of curtains.    It cannot – my argument is that it is the delivery thereof which becomes a National Security issue.    Place – house yes.    Yes.    Chairperson I do not know if I am dealing with it but I save to say a critical issue.  We have been dealing with a case where the management of crime intelligencedecided to buy PPE for Covid – now I am talking masks, sanitizers and all of those sort of things and they decided to use what we call Secret Service account.  Now they have got two accounts the other one they call it open account the other one they call secret service account and you askyourself because secret service account is used for cover operations. So where do you buy those because from where we are sitting as and when you go and buy them it is – it could be issued to anybody. What you have to worry about is that after the purchase who do you issue to and that is the level at which you should start protecting the identity of the recipients. But you should not be using the secret account to purchase – to purchase those things.  It is happening    Let me explain that and – yes and it is a finding of the Mokgoro Commission where we have letters that were written by seasoned and very senior prosecutors toour office to say that this and that other issue it is – it falls under your exclusive jurisdiction.  The police can never ever you know investigate a particular matter and I think that the Justice Mokgoro would have made a finding on it and it led to the removal of two of the senior – very senior prosecutors. So that is an example of that absurdity where people say that it is only you because I think that they – they have reconciled themselves with the fact that this office is so weakened that nothing will happen.    I cannot prosecute.     That is correct, Chairperson.    That is correct.  And Chairperson, this has led at a particular point where I convened what we called – we used the word trapper(?) tide(?), supper(?) tide workshop.  [Speaker not clear]  We sat around the tablebecause ...[indistinct] kept on using a term – they were referring to us as a clearing house.  So whenever I picked an investigator approaches them and say that I am investigating this particular matter, they will say that but the OIGI is our clearing house.  In other words, they were giving me powers to     I said that we cannot be regarded(?) with that and there were a lot of deliberations.  We then made resolution about that issue.  They withdrew(?) in that meeting, the usage of the concept and we signed thoseminutes.  They are part and parcel of the documents that I would have submitted to the Commission.     I confirm that, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct.  That is the letter that I referred to, yes.     That is my submission.  That is correct, Chairperson.    Which paragraph is that?     Alright.  Now there was a stage that General Jacobs wrote to Parliament and he titled(?) about acomplaint against the OIGI.There were several complaints.  The first one, he was complaining that I was threatening him.  There was a letter that I – that he thought it was a threat.  And secondly, that the information I our possession would find itself, you know, somewhere else.  And in this instance, if I have to be specific, is that they were part of my certificate that were sent to the National Anti-Corruption Hotline of the Public Service Commission and I was called to come and account and explain whether it was not my office that would haveleaked that information.  I have no business leaking information to that because I have clear reporting lines.  So I do not need to do that.     That is correct.  And my explanation was accepted.     And the allegations were seeing as being unsubstantiated.       Firstly Chairperson, this amount to a legislative difficulty because the Auditor General is mandated in terms of the founding legislation.  We are mandated with that.  In our legislation the Oversight Act, we are not given auditing mandate of function and if you like, whether you differentiate it between financial auditing performance, audit and all those other things.  We do not have any business to do that kind of work.  But maybe let us ask ourselves.  If I had to do that particular work, to which report was going tobelong(?)?  Because the Auditor General will write their own report and we actually write what we call certificate.  We report to different authorities in Parliament or committees, if you like, but the most important thing is that we do not even have auditing capacity.  I am not an auditor myself.  I do not have an auditor in my office and I do not see even Treasury allowing us to recruit auditors because by legislation we do not have that particular, you know, mandate.But the problem about it, about this practise called Combined Audit Assurance is that there was a sort of an agreement before my arrival where the Auditor General’s Office will then give the so-called working documents to our staff members but it is obvious that they will really, really conduct what is called a box tickingexercise because they did not even understand, they cannot even get deeper into this particular issue.So it was really giving or creating lots and lots of problems.  One of those being that the Intelligence Services had even reached an agreement, I do not know how, with Auditor General but before you even start auditing us you can qualify us already or disclaimer or, you know, in terms of what they called slush funds in the SSA or what they call secret service account and they are taking about 10% of the budget allocated to those agents.  So it is the bulk of the money and they created deliberately so a blind spot for the Auditor General.  So it was only ourselves who could go there and I have to admit today that I do not think that we really had capacity to audit that particular portion of the budget.    That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.    I confirm that, Chairperson.  So when I see that we did not have an auditing function, I did not mean that we did not book into their books.  We looked into theirbooks but we call it something else.  It is oversight but we do look at their books.  So you will see that this area albeit you know a blind spot to the answer(?) but there is a lot happening as far as those portions of the budget were concerned.    That is correct, Chairperson.     That is correct, Chairperson.     I do have a comment and maybe let me usean analogy of a tale which works a dock(?).  The other way around and tell you about this meeting that was convened by the JSCI Chairperson there.  And the Auditor General that is the late Thembekile Kimi Makwetu was there.  I was there, representing this office and then there were peoplefrom the CFO’s, most importantly, that were sitting there.  And the SSA had gone to do a benchmark with the other countries.  Their interest was to establish how do these other countries deal with the auditing of the Intelligence Services and they made recommendations.  That is the reason why the meeting was called, to say that we have to also make inputs.  Chairperson, I never go to Cape Town and I did not utter a word.  This is the only meeting that I went and I never uttered a word in that meeting.  I only introducedmyself and I never uttered anything because I was very much surprised that an intelligence service will go do a benchmark, approach a Committee of Parliament and the oversight bodies and tell them that this is how we would like to be audited and they will be using a particular jurisdiction.  It is a country that I will not mention with a name, you know, by a name but literature and your OECD reports and other transparency, international and all those other things, they would have rated that country as numberone most corrupt country in Africa.  Now there they – and     I beg your pardon?    Well, it was not my document.  It was not given to me.  I never even bothered to request that document.  So I do not have it.  It is not there in thebundle that I have provided.     No, no I was referring to something else.     I was saying that the country that was being fed of the model that was preferred, that country has been ranked as you know number one by literature and someresearch conducted by, for example, transparency international.     Yes, yes.     That is my conclusion, Chairperson.  And my wish is that it is understood again in the context that I would have raised earlier to say that we have hope.  We did not only come here to assist the Commission.  We also have hope that maybe this Commission would be different from all other commissions.  It is the first commission that has a rule whichsays that the information gathered here may be used for prosecution.  I think that is a novelty as far as this Commission is concerned.  So in my conclusion, I am saying that this rot should not be allowed to happen again in future and we hope that, as I mentioned there, that therewill be proper consequent management now moving forward.  I personally will not be a beneficiary of this.  I will be out of this office on the 15 t h of March 2022 but I will be the happiest man if my successor will reap the rewards if there are any in terms of strengthening this oversight mechanism which is very much crucial in the Intelligence space.       Chairperson, I had an opportunity to go and refresh my mind again because I received – I was made aware of this particular affidavit.   First point, in my evidence I have never said that Danny refused the security clearance, I said that theprocess was completed but then he recalled the file and allocated it to somebody else.  So in fact you are saying the same thing, it is only that I think that we are only differing with regard to at what stage did he intervene.  But he did intervene and he is confirming it.  I am confirming it as well.   So I have never said that he would have refused.  Anyway, he does not have powers to refuse because it get signed by the DG especially for such senior people.  So Mr Nxasana is so senior that an expectation will be that it willbe sent by DG and not anybody.  By that time Danny was a general manager for that, but that is one point. The second point with regard to the timeframes, I have got difficulty there because he does not tell us on what date was security clearance given.  My version is thatit was issued on the 6 March and …[intervenes]     2014, yes.  Now if you take that date and you go through the information that we have just received, albeit not complete, you will realise that there will be entries beyond the 6 March and that can only suggest one thing and one thing only that the investigation with regard to Mr Nxasana continued beyond him getting the security clearance.   We cannot say that the process was whetherstopped or whatever or whatever but the legislation which deals with the appointment of the NDPP says that he cannot resume his duties until that process is finalised.  So if he had provided the date exactly when this thing was restarted and when it was consequently, you know, finalised, we will then be able to see that Mr Nxasana would not have been allowed to start with that particular process.At least, the third point, the name of Thulani Dlomo is mentioned.  I did not say that Mr Thulani Dlomo wasinvolved in refusing, I said that the investigator was sent to him to get the names of the people in Kwazulu-Natal that could assist with that particular process.  That is what I said.The last point, it is very strange that a DG willrefuse to sign.  That is actually – it is a pure administrative matter.  This file would have passed through a committee, an adjudication committee.  The reason why they sent it to there, it is because they want to remove that human element so that if I am hated by the Director General, he is not given an opportunity to be a sole decision-maker.  So my take is that once it has passed this committee, it is as good as being accepted and issued.     I do not see where I am differing with Dannyif there are any differences it could be about the dates and at what stage did [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     I beg your pardon again, sorry?     That could be correct because even if it is correct I do not see a conflict between what I am saying and what he is saying so that here we could be talking about two different dates but the activity itself took place and we are both confirming that.     That is what I am saying, Chairperson.    That is correct, at least now that I had an opportunity to look at that particular affidavit, we are both saying the same thing again in that regard.     That is correct, Chairperson, but maybe Ishould also mention to say that his version about the availability of the documents …[intervenes]     Ja, at the time that I was conducting this monitoring or investigation, if you like, Danny was out ofthe system.  So there was an acting person.  He has since returned, that is the reason why we are using a pseudo name, he has since returned but he has returned after I had conducted that and there is a written report from an acting personnel or the personnel manager who says that we could not locate at least a physical file of Mr Nxasana.  I will be very happy – if he had to cross-examine me on that I think I have got to concede to say that you found it, I did not find it.      That is correct.     That is correct, Chairperson.     I do have the summary of that report, Chairperson.     I suspect that it will be in the documentsthat I can give.     And look, it is my document, it is our document, I was told declassify, we have got the power to put any restrictions if we want to [inaudible – speaking simultaneously]     As I said earlier that certain issues graduate out of national security, I mean, but if you say that you have to investigate further criminally and charge person A, what is secret about that?     I was not present, Chairperson.
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.    Do you have any objection to taking theprescribed oath?    Do you consider the oath binding on your conscience?    Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.

ADV MYBURGH SC:   Good afternoon Chairperson.     Yes we are.        Thank you Chairperson, good afternoon Mr Gama.    I was at the point yesterday of taking you through Mr Singh’s version in relation to the 100 locomotives.   I would like to just finish off on that if I may I think I have taken you to one paragraph in one of hisaffidavits, I would like to take you to a few others.  Could I ask you please to turn to Exhibit BB23, Bundle 5C, and could I ask you please, Mr Gama, to turn to page 1464, one, four, six, four. Perhaps, I could just ask you to direct your     And then at 152    You have a comment on the others?      And then 153 says    Now as I understood from your evidence yesterday, at least at the time, when you presented the business case you had confidence in Mitsui.  I think you said with the benefit of hindsight things mighthave changed.     Alright, if I could then take you please, to some aspects of the Fundudzi Report on the 100 locomotives.  Could you turn Exhibit BB27.  I just wanted to ask your comment, if I could ask you please to turn to page 127.     127, and if I could direct your attention Mr Gama, can I just ask you to clarify one or twothings.  At page 127 go to paragraph 5.6.8.16 I think it is, the third last paragraph.  It is apparent from the text that Fundudzi asked certain questions of you and you provided a written response.   With regard to that paragraph it says     Yes, this relates to the 100.     Alright, so in other words, what you are talking about there is post approval?     Could I then ask you please to go to the top of page 128.   “In his response, Gama further indicated that the decision to confine the procurement of 0 locomotives to CSR, was extensively debated andconsidered upon and was arrived at after rational consideration of all the financial, technical, operational, legal, and compliance related facts.”     Alright, well I raised it only with you, because it appeared to me to be different to the evidence that you gave yesterday.  But again, if as I understand it, you saying it relates more to what you did after the decision was taken.     And it is the same answer that you gave in relation to Sub 16?      And then…[intervenes]     Yes, thank you but Chairperson this is – I would just confirmed the memorandum or Mr Gama's responses will be something that he asked us to discover which we did.  It has not found its way into the bundle, because we thought he might put it out if you wanted to rely upon it.  But perhaps for the sake of completeness, wecan add that document into the end of the bundle.     I assume we can we may even be able to do that today.      Then Mr Gama just two subsequent     Alright, and then could I ask you     Thank you.  Mr Gama could you then please go to page 13 and if I could ask you to have a look     The next paragraph says    And then it says, I think then they go     Yes.      Yes, thank you I just wanted to makesure that I understood your evidence in this regard Mr Gama. It is correct that you did attend the meeting of the 24 t h of January?     Can I just ask – but if you could turn up Exhibit BB4A, I want to go the minutes again.     Yes, I just wanted you to please turn in Exhibit BB4A to page 228, it is annexed to Mr Callard’s affidavit, the minutes we looked at them yesterday briefly.  You will see that these are the minutes of the meeting on 24 January, we identified that Mr Molefe and Singh were present and that you were partially in attendance, you and Mr Gianni. This meeting if one has regard to the heading   You want to comment on that?   If I could then take you back to the Fundudzi Report and this is the last thing I am going to put to you in relation to the 100 locomotives and this report.  Can you turn please to page 160.  There if I can direct your attention to the middle of the page.  It says at paragraph5.8.29.4. “Transnet would have saved R1.2 billion if it procured 100 locomotives from Mitsui.”Do you have any comment on that?    I would then like to address briefly the issue of the increase in the ETC of the 100 locomotives from 3.8 billion to 4.8 billion.  Now we saw yesterday that the agreement was concluded on the 17 t h of March 2014.    No stick – stick with that.    We will come to the relevant part in amoment.  So we saw yesterday the LSA’s concluded on 17 March 2014.  The evidence has been that Mr Singh then requested Mr Laher to prepare a memorandum explaining why the prices had increased from the business case submission and ultimately that memorandum was produced and there is reference to it.  If I could ask you to go to page 141 of the Fundudzi Report.  It says there at paragraph 5.6.18.8. “We determined that Molefe, Singh and Gama issued a memorandum to the board on 23May recommending approval to increase the ETC from 3.8 billion to 4.8.”Now it refers to Annexure B35 that you were furnished with.  You will find that document in another file perhaps I could ask you to leave that document open andthen if someone can help you find Bundle BB4(f).   This is Transnet Bundle 4 here.  Transnet Bundle 4.      4(b).  Could you turn to page 550 that is where you will find the memo.      Ja.  Now let me just take you directly to the last page 563.   563 Chairperson.    That is the signature page.  Now you    Now this memorandum the evidence has been that for about two months from the 17t h of March up until the third week or so in May – for two months Mr Laher assisted Mr Singh in putting together this memorandum.  Mr Laher gave evidence that Mr Singh would in fact send him updates, changes that had to be made and Mr Laher would then type them and effect them.  Would you confirm that this is the work of Mr Singh when he was the first recommender, do you confirm that?    Ja.  Now Mr Callard gave some evidence that he considered the price increase not to be justifiable.  Evidence to that effect was also given by an expert Mr Chawbe.  Now this is an issue that is being played out in our examination you will recall Mr Chairperson of Mr Singh because he is the author of this document.  An expert report has been put up.  He has filed a comprehensive affidavit etcetera.  I do not want to – and you were not issued with a 3.3 in respect of Mr Chawbe’s evidence.  I do not want to be unfair to you and take you through all of that Iwill just simply ask you to – to comment. There is – there has been evidence led that this increase is considered not to be justifiable.  Mr Chawbe said that anything above 800 million would not be justifiable.  Do you have any comment that?  I mean I would accept entirely that it is a strictfinancial issue.    He was the expert who gave evidence.    I beg your pardon.    Well Mr Laher’s view as I recall was that he did what Mr Singh told him to do.    Alright.  I want then to – to turn to the procurement of the 1064 locomotives.      I am going back to Bundle 6 yes.    And I want to take you to that portion of the Fundudzi Report it makes it easy to identify the core facts dealing with the 1064.  Can I take you please first topage 177.  In fact I will start at 178.  Are you there?      Can I direct your attention please to paragraph 5.9.10 towards the foot of the page under the heading Business Case/Budget.  Paragraph – first sub-12 MAY 2021 – DAY 393   You have a lot of – a lot of flags and dividers.  I think it is probably the first document or close to the beginning.  It is page FQC401 Mr Gama.    Annexure FC54.  You have it?   So on the first page if you go to 402 you will see there procurement of the 1064 locomotives for general freight business.  Date of submission 25 April addressed to Transnet board of directors.  And this is adocument that runs to 115 pages.  Perhaps you could go to the end and that is at page 516.  I think I have asked you already whether you recall ever signing this business case and perhaps in fairness I must mention to you that we for some reason have not been able to find the signed version. Can you recall ever signing it?    Alright.      That is correct.  So if we can go back to the beginning of the business case.  Now I want to take you to page 405 because as you know it is this phrase excluding that has become contentious.  If you look at 405 the last paragraph second sentence. “Accordingly it is recommended that the 1064 locomotive business case be approved with estimated total costs of the acquisition of 38.6 billon as per the corporate plan (excluding the potential effects from forexhedging, forex escalation and other price escalations.)”You see that?    Then if I can ask you please to go backto the Fundudzi Report this is at Bundle 6 you should still  have it open page 177.  177 three paragraphs from the bottom. “According to Callard the business case submitted to the board incorrectly stated that the ETC of 38.6 billion excluded forex escalation and other price escalations.”And the next paragraph. “We determined that the final business case dated 25 April 2013 submitted to the boardwas amended to state that the ETC of 48.6 billion excluded the potential effects from forex hedging, forex escalation and other price escalations.”You want to comment on those two paragraphs?    Yes.    So you deal with this in some detail in one of your affidavits.    Let me take you there.  Exhibit BB28 Bundle 7.      It is I am afraid.      Page 250.170.      Yes we have it and we have got it inthe bundle already.    We will come to that DCJ.    So Mr Gama you deal with this inparagraph 78.6 and what you dealing with there is the creation and the development of the business case.  If you go over the page to 171 you will see 123456 lines down on    Now if I could take you to the minutes of the board meeting held on the 25 t h of April 2013 which we have already references in the Fundudzi Report.  Theseminutes you will be assisted you find in Bundle BB4(a).  Oh sorry BB4(g) I beg your pardon.  Pierre it is that file.  Could I ask you please to turn to page 59.  You will see at page 59 that this is a minute of the special board of directors of Transnet meeting held on 25 April 2013.  You will see that present were inter alia Mr Molefe, Mr Sharma and Mr Singh and there was partial attendance by yourself and Mr Peter.  You see that?    Now this meeting said in terms of the   And then if you go to the followingpage 61 you will see right at the end that the meeting closed    I beg your pardon 15   The resolution that was adopted appears just above the heading close at page 61 and it contains this sentence that we have been discussing.“The business case for the acquisition of the 64 locomotives for TFR’s general freight business at an estimated cost 38.6 billion as per corporate plan.”And then the contentious piece. “Excluding potential effects for forex hedging, forex escalation and other price escalations.The submission of PFMA application to the shareholder Minister for approval.”You see that?    And it says…    I am at page 61 – the page numbers are difficult to read.    Well yes it is 51 and 61.  I think the official page number Chairperson is YM61.    If you will see it has got a line through it and then there is…    Handwritten 51.  I think it shouldactually be 61.      If you go to just above the heading close at the foot of the page.    You go up about five lines or so you will see there is a heading resolved that the board approved the following.    So what the board approved there was the business case an estimated cost of 38.6 billion and then you have the contentious phrase excluding.    Yes.  So Mr Gama I just want to ask you then were you present when this resolution was adopted?    So why did you not correct that statement?     ...the Business Case?  [Speakerunclear – microphone not switched on]     You find that passage ...[intervenes]      So that is Exhibit BB-4(b).       ...first document.    BB-4(b).     Yes.  Mr Callard’s annexures.     The Business Case...[intervenes]      ... starts at page 402.     Yes, what I think that what Mr Gama has put to you, you have shown us with reference to 442 that foreign escalation was considered in the Business Case ...[intervenes]      ...in arriving at the figure of 38.6.  The point is that 442 does not tell you what 405 which says that it excluded the potential effects of foreign escalation.  And the evidence is that that purpose, that preamble, that was a – it should not change and there is evidence to theeffect that, just as I have put to you now, it is at odds with the Business Case.  So Mr Gama, perhaps I can ask you to comment on that before I put something else to you.     Do you want to comment on that?     Yes but we are not dealing with that now.  We are dealing with the Business Case that is presented to the board on the 25 t h of April 2013 and the assumption is ...[indistinct] that.       Yes.  Well, again, I just want to put to you again.  What we are looking at now is the position as of 25 April 2015.  Bu Mr Gama, do you not put it simply     Right.       So they were included?    They say here that they were excluded.  It is as simple as that.     Alright.  I would just ...[intervenes]     Well, let me just take you to some of the evidence that has been led.  Mr Laher and Mr Mole and Mr Callard were requested in 2018 to undertake an investigation to determine if the Business Case of 38.6 ETC included forex hedging and escalation and they found that it did.  Do you agree or disagree with that evidence?     I am paraphrasing the evidence that has been given.    You will remember that evidence has been given, Chairperson, that in 2018 Mr Laher, Mr Mole and Mr Callard were requested to undertake an investigation to determine if the Business Case, ETC of 38.6 included forex hedging and escalation and they concluded that it did.  Mr Gama does not disagree with that.     There has also been evidence by Dr Fine of McKinsey, who testified that the Business Case ETC of 38.6 also included, he said, hedging and escalation.  You would not disagree with that?     Alright.  And the expert, Mr Chawde, also came to that conclusion.       I take it you would not disagree with that?    Well, Chairperson this is not really contentious because I put this to Mr Gama and he agreed.  He does not disagree with the fact that the ETC of 38.6 in fact included foreign hedging and escalation costs.  He does not disagree with that.  His own affidavit says that.      Yes, certainly.  I am going to put to you also what Mr Molefe had to say about this because hewas questioned about this – the very same phrase but let – one of our researches will find the full passage.     So that I can read it to you.  I do not want to just paraphrase.  Let me come back to that.     So that is the Business Case ETC.  I now want to deal with the increase in that ETC.  Could I ask you, please, to go to the Fundudzi Report at 183?  That is – I beg your pardon.  Chairperson, it is Bundle 6.    So it is BB-27.       And if you have a look at 183, there     Now what I have seen amongst the documents is will you accept that a similar memorandum, in I think almost identical terms, was then prepared and recommended by the three of you for the board.  I can take you there.  Perhaps you can leave that open for a moment.     So that is to the BADC.  What youfind is if you could go to EXHIBIT BB8, you will find a corresponding memorandum to the board.  BB8(b)1.  Could you please – can you help Mr Gama turn to page 165?  Red numbers, 165.  You will see that this is addressed whereas the memorandum in Callard’s bundle is addressed toBADC, this is …[intervenes]     It is BB8(b)1 and the 2.  If you will turn to page 165 please, red numbers.  It is in the first divider, 165.  Mr Gama, are you there?     So what you will see is that this is the corresponding memo.  Callard’s annexure relates to theBADC, this annexure is to the board.  If you go to page 182 you will see that it is the same recommendation and it is signed by the three of you.  Do you see that?     And would you confirm that...     If it is the same memorandum?     We will come back to the contents of these memos in a moment.  Could I ask you please to goback to the Fundudzi report and I have taken you to paragraph 5.9.12.1 that deals with the BADC memo, we have now identified the corresponding one to the board.     183.    Then there is a heading BADC     And then if you go to the board meeting where your recommendation presumably served.      Present in the schedule, amongst others, Mr Molefe and Mr Singh and then over the page, Mr Sharma.  Do you see that?     Now perhaps we could – we can use either of these memos, let us use the one given that they are the same, contained in Mr Callard’s annexures, page 714.  At paragraph 14 – and sorry, let me …[intervenes]     714 of Callard’s annexures.     Ja.  Now if you go to paragraph 14     And then if you go to paragraph 23 at page 717 …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, absolutely.       Yes, if I could – so what this motivates for is an increase.  Perhaps if you go to the recommendation it states it most clearly at page 731.      Yes.     Yes.     That was the exclusion of that and the exclusion of the cost of future inflationary increases – escalations, I beg your pardon.     And it is on that basis that it also BADC recommends an increase, is that correct?      So you were not present at the BADC meeting or the board meeting but certainly there has been evidence and it has been put or will be put to Singh and Molefe that they misrepresented the position to BADCand the board insofar as they contended that the business case, reason for the increase was that the business case excluded Forex hedging and escalation.  Do you want to comment on that?     But you signed both this memo and the one to the board.     Now, Mr Gama, just dealing with the justifiability of the entries on 38.6 to 54.5, the situation is the same and perhaps more acute as it is in relation to the 0 locomotives.  So perhaps I can explain it this way.  Again Mr Chawde, gave evidence about this increase, an expert, given that these two memos were the work of MrSingh and it is really a financial issue.  That evidence was presented to Mr Singh.  Mr Singh has – Chairperson, I do not know if you have yet to see this, I do not think it has been introduced into evidence but Mr Singh has produced himself an expert who has given a contrary expert report and those things are still going to be dealt with with Mr Singh when he returns to testify the week after next.  So I do not want tax you about things and you are correct, you were not given Chawde’s report, I do not want to tax you about that, but is this like with the 100locomotives an issue that you are happy to leave to be fought out there or is there any comment that you have in relation to the justifiability of this increase?     Alright then just on this – lastly on the memo, can I just ask you please to go to page 727, it is FQC727.  There are a number of …[intervenes]     That is bundle BB4(b).     727, Chair.     Mr Gama, could I ask you to have alook at 727 and paragraph 80?      This has become a contentious     Alright.     And then there are two other issues which also featured with Mr Molefe and will with Mr Singh and that is the issue of the conclusion of the LSAs beforeobtaining board approval.  But I think you mentioned yesterday that you yourself did not sign the LSAs, they were signed by Mr Singh and Mr Molefe, is that correct?     I can take you to one of the agreements if you...     Well, it gets you off the hook.  We can save some time.    And then the other – another contentious issue relates to the failure to obtain ministerial approval but again I think Mr Molefe, he accepted that the obligation to do that rested on him, it did not rest on you. Would you accept that?     So that brings me to just one thing that I want to ask you about and that is the issue of batch pricing.  You have mentioned – and we know that it was a significant contributor to the increase in the ETC.  Now this is something that is dealt with in the MNS report.  Perhaps I could just ask you to go there.  This is bundle 6, EXHIBIT BB27, the one that contains the reports.  And if I could ask you to turn to page 312, please?  And you see there, if I    Do you want to comment on that?     I said I think you deal with it also in your affidavit.     Alright, then let’s go there.  Sorry, I have got myself swamped with files, just give me a moment.  What page are you at?  So you are presumablyMr Gama in Bundle 7, Exhibit BB28?   Your file.      Ja.     I am not able to find it offhand, I think I might have had in mind where Mr Gama deals at some length with the accelerated delivery schedule, I am not sure offhand, perhaps his counsel can help us as to where Mr Gama – bearing in mind he filed more than oneaffidavit, I assume it must be, if it is here it must be in the affidavit responding to Mohamedi and Callard.     Alright, thank you.    Fifteen Chairperson if possible yes, fifteen I think would be ...[intervenes]    Thank you.     Mr Gama do you want to comment on the issue of batch pricing?     So Mr Gama I perhaps just want to put this to you for your comment, the problem that allowingthe OEM’s to increase their prices at the negotiation stage could result in their bid prices increasing beyond those of the unsuccessful bidders, that’s really the problem and that is certainly the evidence of Mr Laher.So in other words you split the batches, the prices then went up, this happens during the negotiations stage.     Right do you have anything further to add to that?     Right Mr Gama I would like now to turn to the last locomotive topic thankfully, and that relates to the relocation in particular of CNR South Africa from Pretoria to Durban.  Now this is dealt with as you know by Mr Gonsalves, can I ask you perhaps just to pick out hisfile, that is Exhibit BB5, you do deal with it in your affidavit and I will come back to that.  Right, you have BB5?     Well perhaps you can just go to the first page.  What I am going to try and do Mr Gama, I have got these topics that I still have to deal with, I am going to try and summarise or the background at least, and then get to what I want to deal with.  What Mr Gonsalves affidavit reflects from a broad overview is that on the 11 t h of March 14 CNR submits an initial costing of 9.7million for therelocation, we then see on the 25 t h of April 2014 CNR concludes a business development service agreement with Becks, with the project benchmark being 580million.  In July 2015 a costing of R647million was submitted to Transnet and ultimately you agreed in signing the variationorder on the 23 r d of July 2015 and the net effect of this then was that Becks was a commission of R67million.  We have been through this affidavit, would you accept that broad outline?I suppose the important thing is your signature of the variation order, let me take you to that document, that you find at page 261, that is where you become directly involved.  You see at 261 you write to CNR Rolling Stock South Africa and it is headed variation order to finalise the relocation, the construction of the 233 Class 45-Elocomotives by CNR Rolling Stock South Africa, who ...[indistinct] facility in Durban and then you say in the     And you sign this on the 23 r d of July5.     Now we do have a short set of documents that are contained in your bundle, perhaps I could take you to them and those documents you findtowards the end of your exhibit 28, at page 250.401, and the documents start with a memorandum and what we have is there seems to be two signature pages, at 404 there is a signature on the 9 t h of June 2015 and then at 405 there appears to be another undated signature where there is a handwritten annotation, is that your handwriting at 250.405?     So which of these two pages then would be the official page, for want of a better description,would it be 405?     Well in the sense that there’s two pages, the one is signed and dated by you, the other is signed and not dated and then there is an annotation, I am not trying to make an issue of it I just want to know would one read them together or is 405 with the annotation.     Sure.     Yes, no certainly.     Oh I see, so 405 relates to BT?     Okay.     Okay.     Okay.    Yes.      Okay so I understand what you are saying, so 405 is an earlier version.     And 404 was then the one that you signed later.    Yes I ...[intervenes]      Can I just ask you just to read into the record if you don’t mind your handwritten annotation at 405.      And then if you can go back to 404, so subsequently on the 9 t h of June 2015 you approved of a     So that is in 9 June.  I want to then take you ...[intervenes]     Right, what you see then at page 406, 350.406, is an email from Mr Pita on the 20 t h of June.     250.406.     Mr Pita was the Chief Financial Officer is that correct?    Okay.  What was his position then?     And you have seen this email, Imean what he sets out, received a proposal and he raises a number of queries, is that correct?     So for example in the 4 t h paragraph he says get a list of suppliers they are using in Gauteng and total material they expect from them, as they say they’re moving 1.3million material but it doesn’t make sense because they don’t have many suppliers set up as yet, per my info.  And he raises a number of issues along those lines, correct?   And he in this email if you go for example over the page at 407, he says at the top Yusuf to check the assumptions, the last paragraph Yusuf to check financial – finance costing, do you see that?      That I assume was Yusuf Laher?     Then what we see ...[intervenes]      Alright, and then at 408 the next day Mr Laher responds, the second half of the page, from Yusuf     And he questions really in 18 respects the price that has been submitted.  He raises a number of queries.    Let’s take one for example, increasing the team size does not make sense considering the learning curve will mitigate this requirement in a short time.  Two, negotiating with suppliers will eliminate the inflationary costs related to the four different ...[indistinct] etcetera, do you agree with that?     Alright.  And then if you go to page 410 you will see towards the bottom of the page that    That is on the 25 t h of June, if I could then ask you to turn to page 250.412, it is 25 June, then Gary Pita on the 10 t h of July sends an email to Lindiwe and the second paragraph says, right at the bottom of the   Now just ...[intervenes]     Yes.  Alright, well in fact I was going to get to that because I see that some of these emails are copied to Mr Singh, you see in fact at this very page, 250.412, that email is cc’d to him.    Was he a member of the negotiating team?    And we see at 250.4.1.10 also the bottom email was also sent to Mr Singh.  Correct?   Then what we have in chronological order is the next memorandum to you that you find at page 250.415 and this you signed on the 23rd of July 2015, that you find at 250.418, is that correct?    And that – that memorandum relates to – to Bombardier Transport.    You get a similar memorandum if youpage a little bit further at 250.419 you get a similar memorandum in relation to CNR.  There you see the signature 23 July 2015 you see that?    Requesting the recommendation – theacting Group Chief Executive to note the final outcome of the negotiation for the relocation to Durban with CNR approved variation order and the amount there is 647 million.  You see that?    Now it does appear that CNR concludes a business development service agreement with BECS and the money flows have or will provide evidence that BECS is a Gupta linked company.  Did you know anything about this business development supplyagreement?    And do you accept that ultimately BECS was paid an amount of some 67 million?    Alright well the evidence that the money flows team will lead is that BECS was paid I assume this is including VAT some 76 million and of this 62 million was paid to a number of so called first level laundering entities.  Do you have any comment on that?    Do you know of any involvement by BECS – do you know of anything that they may have done to secure this variation order and this amount?   How is that the negotiations were conducted in such a way that it would allow for a commission of this size 67 million?    Or are you surprised by the fact thatthere was that amount?    So Mr Gama do I understand from what you say in your affidavit that you relied on the people whoput – reports to you and recommendations made to you yourself did you know of Mr Laher’s concerns?    Laher’s concerns.    Did you know of Mr Peter’s concerns?    Have you got any idea how those concerns were resolved?    Yes.    Alright then can I take you – you deal with this in your affidavit perhaps you can address that if you would like to.  Go to your Exhibit 28 and turn up page 146.   Yes.    Perhaps I could ask you just to go to the POI Bundle the one with the reports in.  Bundle 6 Exhibit 27. MNS deal with this in a so called relocation report. Could I just take you please to page 427.      Bundle 6 Chairperson yes.      427.  At paragraph 2.8 I just want to –    Then I had said I would take you to your affidavit.  You deal with this at page 146.  That is at the beginning of Exhibit 28.  Not 250.146 but 146.  And this is in response to Mr Molefe and deal with this at some – some length running from page     Ja in fact I – on the right hand side yes.   Running through to I think it is 154.    And you end off actually by referring to Mr Laher’s concerns which you say you had no knowledge of.  Is there anything in particular that you would like to deal with in these pages?    Yes.    Sure.    And Mr Gama you also deal with this further at page 165 in dealing directly with Mr Goncalves’ statement.  Perhaps if you want to – if there is anything you want to deal with at paragraphs 47 and 48 it seems that these are things you have –      We have already traversed by and large.    Alright.  Can I just before I conclude on this can I ask I have seen reference and some documents to the effect that in addition to concluding these LSA’s with the OEM’s you also concluded maintenance contracts, is that right?    So those were separate contracts?    What I must just mention to you if you want to comment you can is that money flows evidence shows that Mr Essa also concluded BDSA’s in relation to the maintenance contract.    Business Development Services Agreements.    In other words these…    So you were talking about the 67 or so million that BEX was paid and you said well perhaps it couldhave been lower if it had not been for that.  I just want to – to put this to you.  Money flows intends to lead evidence which will demonstrate that the total – the grand total of all kickbacks paid to the Gupta enterprise relating to the 95 locomotives, the 0 locomotives, the 359 and 232 locomotives that being part of the 1064, the attendant maintenance contract that you have spoken about and the CNR relocation costs that we have spoken about the grand total is just short of R3.5 billion.    I mean that must come as a real shock.    Yes.     I want now to turn to the issue of T-Systems.  T-Systems is dealt with as you know by Ms Macede.  Can I ask you please to turn up file BB – sorry Exhibit BB11.  Ja.  So could I ask you to go to page 1.  Now Mr Gama I am going to try and paraphrase the evidence of Ms Macede I mean a lot of this is not in dispute and there is a lot of common ground between two of you.Perhaps you could go to page 5 and you will see that she says that Transnet issued and approved a RFP with theprovision of IP Data Services to Transnet in November 2015.  I just ask you to confirm that we know that the entity that held the contract before them was T-Systems.  They had had a five year contract which had been extended I think by two years would you confirm that?    And she says at 13 a tender related to the outsourcing of Data Services for the whole of Transnet.If you go to page 6 paragraph 14.1 the estimated cost of this tender was 1.85 billion over five years.  She goes onto explain at paragraph 16 that there were seven bidders including T-Systems and Gajema.    She then goes on to explain that two bidders were shortlisted.That being T-Systems andUbunthu.  And over the page – page 8 Ubunthu withdrew and was then replaced by the third highest ranking bidder Gajema.    So now it was Gajema and T-Systems.    She says at paragraph 20 that on the 22n d of September 2016 she was presented with a complete file of the evaluation process by Mr Thomas requesting my signature on the recommendation to award the tender to T-Systems.  You confirm that.    Then she says at page 9 at the top that this recommendation was not in line with the evaluation outcome of the process and she explains at paragraph 22.1    She then says at paragraph 25 onpage 10 just below the quoted part she has explained that she had her misgivings but she says I then appended my signature to the recommendation letter this is in respect of T-Systems but made the following comments at the bottom of the letter.  Do you see that?    She says at 26 that    Then at paragraph 28, at page 11, she says that roundabout this time, she held a meeting with you at the Tintswalo Hotel in Waterfall Estate.  She     Then she says at paragraph 30    And then at 31 she says that    She says at 33    Sub-three.  I suppose quite smartly.  You, according to her, made an emphatic point that you wanted to sign only one memorandum to the ADC and nottwo memoranda.  Do you see that?     And then at 34    You were present at this meeting?     And then at 35.4, Mr Zanool(?) Nugby(?).  Was he a member, a Transnet Board member and a member also of the BADC?     Right.  She then says at paragraph     And then she says at paragraph 44    Now you have provided a response to this in two places.  Could I ask you to turn to Exhibit 28?     And you deal with the issue first at page 154 and this is in response to Mr Molefe.  It is quite a     You say at 34.3    You confirm that?     And then the other place that youdeal with this, is when you respond to Ms Mosidi.  Could I ask you please to turn to page 159?     And you deal with this from 159 through to 156.  Perhaps I could invite you ...[intervenes]      One, five – page 159.  I beg your pardon.     To page 165.     Paragraphs 38, Chairperson, to 46.       Now perhaps I could ask you to gothrough this.  It seems that the first paragraph 38 is very much background that we might already have traversed.  If suitable to you, could you start by taking us through from paragraph 39 at page 160, where you deal with the meeting that you had at the Tintswalo Hotel?     [Speaker ’s microphone not switched on – unclear]     Well, perhaps we should just perhaps deal with the viva voce evidence and you can then comment on it.  I mean, I think you have dealt with it broadly.    Well, let us go to page 250.428.  It is almost right at the end of your bundle.  That is a transcript of her evidence.    428.     So at line 20 at page 428, she is now ...[intervenes]      You are not...     So at about line 20 and for the sake of trying to save some time, we get to the key passage. She talks – now she has gone to the hotel and she is     Oh, I am with you.  So you are talking about the transcript number?     Ja.     Alright.  Well, then let us get to the part of your affidavit where you deal with Mr Shane.  If you can go, please, to page 161, paragraph 42?     Yes, 161.  It is right in the front,Chairperson.     Just before you – and I am going to come back to this but have you come to learn that Mr Shane is actually a well-known Gupta associate?  Haveyou come to learn that?     But you have heard ...[intervenes]      So just so that we understand this.  Did Mr Shane, did he replace – who did he replace as the Chairperson of the BADC?     Ja.     Okay so when I talk about replacement, I do not mean it literally.  So we know he succeeded ...[intervenes]      ...Mr Sharma?     Alright.  So can we deal with paragraph 42, please?     Could I ask you – let us go to the judgment, that you find at page 214 of EXHIBIT BB11, annexure to Ms Mosidi’s affidavit.    So if you turn forward in this judgment to page 225 you will see at paragraph 29, 225, that Transnet submits that it acted unlawfully in deciding to award the tender to T-Systems which was not the highest scoring bidder.  Now that was the contention.  And then     Now I want to take you to something    I want to just then take you to the transcript that the court refers to and that you find at page 137.     Yes.     137 the transcript starts and Mr Shane speaks a lot in this transcript and says a number of things but I just want to point out to you at page 145, MrNugdi(?) also addresses the committee, you see at page 145 from line 12, the whole of 146, 147.  At 147 at the top     So I now want to just mention to you what the money flows investigation has revealed and some evidence has been led in this stream about this.  So what the investigation reveals, Mr Gama, is that from mid-2012 to mid-2015 T-Systems made regular monthly payments ofmore than R80 000 to Zestilor.  Zestilor is company that was owned by Salim Essa’s wife.  So more than R3 million was paid over that period.  Those monthly deposits were used to, amongst other things, fund payments to Mr Essa over that three year period.  He received payments of morethan half a million rand.The evidence, Mr Chair, you will remember that has been led in this stream is there was then a time when T-Systems ceded to Zestilor the equipment sale and rental elements of the MSA that it had with Transnet.The money flows team have also investigated this particular transaction and they have come to conclusion analysing the Transnet, as the court did, that Mr Shane motivated strongly in favour of keeping the contract with T-Systems.  Their investigation has revealed that Mr Shaneis a Gupta associate.  What the investigation has also shown is that there is strong evidence suggesting that Mr Nugdi had by February 2017 been operating as a money launderer for the Gupta enterprise and had used his company, Leboshile(?) Technologies to expatriate more than R5 million in proceeds of kickbacks paid to the Gupta enterprise in respect of corruptly procured public sector contract.  Do you have any comment on that, Mr Gama?     Alright.    I want to then turn to my last main topic and then there are just a few things that I need to sweep up after that, concluding questions that I want to ask you.  The last main topic I want to deal with is Nkonki.  Could I ask you please …[intervenes]     Certainly, Chairperson.    Thank you Chairperson.  Alright, Mr Gama please could you go, I think you have been provided with Exhibit BB3a – so affidavit of Mr Mohamed Mohamedi.  Could I ask you to turn to page 29 please.  Mr Mohamedi     250, just hang on Chairperson.  Yes, 250.82.  Are you there Mr Gama?     So this is the Treasury Practice Note    579 after ...[indistinct].   So if you go back to the memorandum at 571 certainly on the face of it, it doesn’t appear that this recommending memo deals with the requirements of the National Treasury practice note in relation to unsolicited bids.     No I can’t remember now but the custodians would have been the procurement sort of thing.     Alright and then let’s deal with theNational Treasury instruction.  I will have to investigate the points you made about whether the practice note applies to the schedule 2 entity.     Let’s turn to the National Treasuryinstruction that you find at page 250.94.   Could I ask you please to go to page 250.97.    It is in Mr Gama’s bundle B28, I am sorry DCJ.     It starts at 250.94, I am going to take Mr Gama if I might to 250.97.     It says at paragraph 9.1 theaccounting officer/accounting authority must ensure that contracts are not varied by more than 20% or 20million, including VAT for construction related goods, works and services and/or services and 15% or 15million including VAT all other goods and services of the original contractname.  Any deviation and excess of the prescribed threshold will only be allowed in exceptional cases, subject to prior written approval from the relevant treasury.  Did you  have regard to this?     I really don’t know and as I say Chair hindsight is a perfect science, where somebody says okay let’s look at certain things my way hindsight, the most important thing is to be able to deal with the things at thetime when they are being dealt with, and it is important for the compliance people to make sure that they have dealt with it, because we could sit here for a very long time, dealing with something where there’s an actual exclusion, I don’t know.     Yes thank you Chairperson.   Mr Gama if I could ask you to turn to your bundle at page 250.146, that is where you respond to Mr Mohamedi, paragraph 5.11 which I have read the whole thing to you.    250.146, and your response spans two pages on.   Do you want to deal with that?     250.146.   This is your response to paragraph 5.11 of Mr Mohamedi that I read to you.     Yes.    Now Mr Gama this – this particular transaction has also been investigated by money flows.  Now I wanted just to put to you whether you were aware that in 2016 the year before this Trillian acquired the auditing firm Nkonki.  Trillian.     That as you know Mr Essa through Trillian Holdings was a 60% shareholder in that business.    Of Trillian.    Trillian acquired Nkonki in 2016.    You know that Mr Essa was a shareholder at Trillian.    In your answer to Mr Mohamedi's paragraph 5.11 you do not take issue with his statement that Nkonki bid was unsolicited.    When you answer paragraph 5.11 of Mr Mohamedi you do not take issue with his statement that Transnet received an unsolicited bid from Nkonki.    Right.    Alright I have got a few things here and there to deal with.  Could I ask you again in your bundle to go to page 250.438.  We have done some further investigations into this JZ Foundation donation.  There you will find an affidavit from Nomvelo Makhunga she was theperson who put up a response before     Thank you Chair.  So what she does in this affidavit is she refers over the page at 439 at paragraph 5 to her response which we went through previously and then at paragraph 6 she says that Mr Zepho Ndlovu a general manager represented Transnet at the event and she sets out the other attendees.  Do you know Mr Zepho Ndlovu?    What was his position?   General manager.    At Transnet port terminal.    And then what we have also managed to find is the delegation of authority that you see at page 250.444, do you see that?   No it is not.      Because there is no delegation ofauthority covering 20 June.    This is the delegation of authority there is not a delegation of authority covering the 20 t h of June.    That would…    Alright.  Well I just want to put to you Mr Gama that we have not been able to find a delegation of authority.  I have specifically asked the investigators they specifically asked Transnet this is the delegation of authority that we have been provided with.    Okay well let us then deal with this.  There was a delegation of authority from 27 June to 12 July,is that correct as per page 444?    Mr Gama was there a – does page 444 reflect a delegation of authority during the period 27 June to 12 July?   And that was signed by you on the 14 t h of June.    So what were you doing during the period 27 June to 12 July?    Or is this when you were in Russia?    And then after that?    Alright.  And then I just wanted to show you we will have to investigate that further – here is the program which has been found at 445 and 446.  And you see at 446 there you are reflected as a speaker.    So is it your case then that Mr ZephoNdlovu was appointed – you gave him the delegated authority of the acting Group Chief Executive on – for the pair 20 June – is that case.    So who was – who was the actingGroup Chief Executive on the 20 t h June?    I beg your pardon.    And then the last two documents 250.447 – 448 this we thank – we received from you if I can start at 448.  You see on the 15t h of February 2018 you wrote presumably to the Oberio Hotel and you said  “I stayed at your hotel in Dubai from the evening of 22 January to 24 January Bill Noso and so has been replaced – has been misplaced and I request a copy of the receipt.  I stayed in room 1601.” And then if you go to 447 at the bottom of the page.  They responded and presumably they provided you then with thedocument.  Is that correct.    And that is the document at page 250.341.    250.341.    I beg your pardon I did not see that.    I am with you.  Alright it is the – well it is the same document that we have at 250.341.    Of course it does not reflect who paid this.    250.341.  Mr Gama.    Yes it is.    No I ..    Yes.    Yes absolutely.  No I appreciate that.  The point is it does not reflect who paid the bill.  It is a simple point.    But that is the very proposition I am putting.    That is precisely the proposition that I am putting.    That it does not tell you who has paid and it is not ridiculous.   Because there at least two documents that show that at least the month and two months after Mr Gama stayed a schedule was being sent to Sahara saying the amount is still outstanding.  So it is oh more than possible that Sahara then settled it and you get a nil balance.  It is a simple proposition.    It does not tell you who paid.    Absolutely.    Alright thank you.  That brings us to the end of those documents.  I want to just take you to…    Mr Gama I want to take you to one or two other issues.  Could I ask you please to turn to Bundle BB4(f) one of the investigators picked it out.  Quite a difficult – have you got it?  BB4(f).  Do you have it Mr Gama?    Could I ask you please to turn page 87.  It relates to the role that you played in relation to the 64 locomotives and particularly in relation to the tender evaluation process.  This is a – a memorandum to the board of directors from Mr Molefe dated the 17t h of January subjectRequest for approval to negotiate and award business to the shortlisted tenderers for the supply of the 599 Coco New Voltage locomotives for general freight business.  The purpose of the memo is to provide an update to the board of directors on the tender evaluation process.  Note andapprove the tender evaluation process from step 1 up to step 6 to the Transnet board of directors.Approve the recommendation of the shortlist tenderers as a result of the tender and evaluation process for negotiations and award of business and delegate all powers etcetera.  I just want to confirm that you were a signatory to this document.  You were part of the recommending team that you see at page 95.  Would you confirm that?    Ja well it arises from evidence that you have given about your role.  That in – that relates to the 599 locomotives.You will see at page 0 a similar memorandum in relation to the 465 diesel locomotives.  Your signature appears at page 108.  You confirm that?    Then I want to end with something that you asked me. You said that if I was of the view that you knew of this corruption and money laundering then I should put it you.  Remember saying that?   So I think it is important Mr Gama that I perhaps explain this.  That different to normal court proceedings evidence leaders do not have a client who has a particular version. Our client is the general public.  So we donot have a particular version ultimately it will be for the Chairperson to assess all of the evidence and determine whether you may or may not have known.  Now I just want to discuss a few things in that regard with you.As I understand is it is your evidence that you were completely unaware of this if money flows certainly is to believed what is corruption and money laundering.  Is my understanding of your evidence correct?    Oppose something ultimately that theChairperson would have to consider is how could you have been unaware of this when it was done on such a grand scale?  It spanned many years as we have seen.  It went through various different phases.  It involved numerous contracts.  How could you have been unaware?  Did you not have an inkling that something was untoward?    Not an inkling?    So…   But Mr Gama you have seen literally at every turn – in fact every contract that we have discussed over the space of the last few days is tainted with corruption and money laundering.      The other thing I just want to ask your comment on I suppose another thing that would have to be considered carefully by the commission is Mr Essa on the money flows analysis and investigation we know has been dubbed as the Gupta Money laundering Lieutenant and you have seen that at least on the face of it he is behind almost all of these contracts that we have been discussing and issues we have been discussing.  Suppose a potentialchallenge is that Mr Essa was well-known to you.  He was also well-known to other senior members of Transnet.  It is not that this is someone who it is not like an intellect scam that you dealing with an unidentified person.  This is Mr Essa you have seen him in meetings with Regiments.  You haveseen him in Mr Singh’s office.  You have been taken by him to Gupta’s.  You have met with him in Dubai and so it goes on and on.     And another thing, I suppose, that would have to be considered is that in order to pull off grand scale corruption and money laundering, literally, of mega-proportions, one would need some sort of insight and insistence, presumably.  One would need some peoplewithin Transnet to be on your side.       And then presumable if there was internal assistance, there would need to be some sort of quid pro quo.  What is your comment on that?     I suppose that then brings us to the evidence of your driver and ...[intervenes]      Well, we have been through that.    And, I mean, as you know your predecessor, Mr Molefe, has also been here implicated to a greater or lesser degree his Chief Financial Officer, Mr Singh, has been implicated.  Mr Peter too has been implicated.  We will hear from him next week.  It isevidence of drivers in relation to them as well.     And then perhaps, let me just finally put to you.  We have been talking now about your peers, your colleagues, some of your subordinates.  But going up a level, you may have heard the evidence of Ms Gigaba in relation – the relationship between Mr Gigaba and the Guptas.  You may have heard that, and of course we are still to hear from Mr Gigaba, and her evidence is still to be tested but if I was to summarise.  Her evidence is to the effect that Mr Gigaba well and truly captured by the Guptas.  That he was told that if you do not do as we say, and this is when he was the Minister of the DPE, his portfolio included Transnet, then you will be send back to Home Affairs.  There is evidence against him by her of him also receiving cash, even at that level, Mr Gama.    That completes our questioning.  There is just one last thing I need to do.    Mr Gama, could I ask you, please, to go back to your Exhibit 28?  Previously, I have taken you through your first affidavit and you said you had nothing to add to that.  Your second affidavit, you will find at page 116.  And then there is an introduction and then the first thing that you deal with is the Barbara Hogan statement at page 123.  I think we have gone through that or you have dealt with that in the context of the first part of my examination of you relating to your reinstatement.  Do youagree with that?     And just let me make it clear that these affidavits must be stand as read and they will, obviously, be considered by the Commission but I just want to make sure that there is – there may not be anything that you need to or want to add.  Then what you do at para – sorry, at page 133 is you deal with Mr Molefe.  Certainly in your opening statement you dealt with much of this stuff and a lot of what he had to say wasof quite a general nature.  But in the context of your response to him, for example, at page 144.  We have dealt with what you had to say about the hundred locomotives.  Another example at page 146 at paragraphs or at your paragraph 33.  We have dealt with relocation which spans a number of pages.  And then at 154 you respond to T-Systems, what he has to say about that.  That we have dealt with.  You deal at paragraph 35 with three separate civil claims.  I do not think this is something that you have dealt with.  You want to say something about that?     Or can we take it as read?     Yes.    And then at page 159, you deal with Mosidi’s statement and we have gone through that in some detail previously.  If you go to page 165, you deal with Gonsalves’ statement.  That we have gone through.  And then at 166, you deal with Witness 2.  We have dealt with that.  So is there anything in this affidavit that you feel you would like to address?     Sorry?     Yes.     Okay.  So in relation to your third affidavit, that deals with Mohamedi and Callard and we have traversed much of that already.  If your counsel has something he wants to put to you in addition to evidence that you have given, of course, he can do that.  And then your fourth affidavit, which you will find at page 250.262, that deals with Witness 2 and something that we have gone through in its entirety.     Thank you, Chairperson.  That concludes our examination of Mr Gama.     Yes, and I suppose you setting out a timeline would be important ...[intervenes]      That is three weeks. 
MR GAMA:   Thank you.       Good afternoon Mr Myburgh.     I think he is correct.    Yeah, I could comment on 1524 and indeed, Mitsui had proposed that they would use existing parts of the 19E so if those parts ran out means also there was a risk in terms of the pricing, and that they have given usthat it would actually change and increase.  So that particular one, I think it is in my knowledge, the other two are in Mr Singh's knowledge.     I have no comment.     Well, I think the confinement had started as early as February of 2013 and I think as time went by, we all know that the people who have got a better ability toaccelerate locomotive delivery is actually the Chinese locomotive manufacturers, they have proven time and time, again that they can do that quicker.  So it is probably true that they would not have been delivered on timeously, even the timeframe that actually expired since the confinement had initially been motored.     I had confidence in the locomotive. I had confidence in their locomotive and it is it had already been delivered and it was in operation but from that time, there were a lot of post commissioning teething problems thatarose afterwards with the Mitsui locomotive.  So here 153 talks specifically to delivery schedules.     127?     Are they talking about the 100 locomotives?     Yeah, I indicated to you yesterday that after the approval by the BADC we then put together technical teams that worked with CSR to agree on the technicalrequirements and to create a prototype, that is what it means.     That is correct, yes.      Yeah, I have had occasion to request through you the report or the responses that Fundudzi talks about or what I do want to say to you at the outset is that a whole lot of these quotations when taken out of context, and when they are not read with the totality and the actual memo that I had sent to them they will send you on a frolic of sorts because they can be taken out of context. So I want you to be aware of that and to note it, because it was when I read the document, that I could see that they were quite conservative in terms of the quotation they quoted those elements, which if you looked at the entire text that they had been looking at, it would give youa very different picture.  So it is not something that you should rely on without looking at the text of the document.  So then coming back to this one it is true that the confinement of the locomotives was extensively debated, as you know, it was initially to Mitsui. We spent even more time on Mitsui, the CSR matter was an after the decision issue when the decision had been taken, and we then had to say a decision is taken how do we make sure that we will operationalise thedivision?  And that is really what this means.     That is correct.     Yes.     I did request a memo, it is also interestingwhen they say Gama this, Gama that.       In the memo, and I qualified in the name, I said, I am not going to talk about the actions of individuals, in terms of what different individuals did, you must go and ask individuals about their issues.  But I am saying from a Transnet perspective, what were the issues, I did obtain that memo, and I think I obtained it from through the Commission. So I think we would be able to, yeah.    That is the impression it leaves gives and I think I have said this yesterday to Chair.  The FundudziReport is crafted and in a manner and way in which it wants to get you to particular outcomes, and it is able to exclude very relevant information that would make the reader actually reach a very different vision if the information given was taken in its totality.      That is correct.    No.     Ja, also, this is when somebody enters an arena that they do not understand, 20E locomotives is a GFP locomotive and we would not try to put EFP locomotives in a heavy haul line, which is the coal line.  So that was never the intent.  The whole issue of the 21E was always the intent. So obviously, if somebody then went and took the GFP locomotive, which has a maximum of 22 tons per axle versus the 26 tons per axle, the price will change, it will be different, but they write here as fact, that which they do not understand and then it permeates across the FundudziReport.     The meeting of 24 t h January Chairperson was described by me in my affidavit as having had a lot of what one may call illogical, if not nonsensical, things that werethere, it is not clear that even the people who were in the meeting understood what they were discussing.  So there is not really much that one can say any further about logic. There was no logic that took place, when this particular matter was discussed, as I looked at the minutes, ja.     That is correct.      Yes, you are quite correct I mean there were a lot of issues that are just conflated.     Yes.     It is true.      Yeah, so in terms of the 100 locomotives, all of those things had been followed but that was only in respect of the Mitsui confinements.     So when it came to the CSR memo that was submitted those were then it.    It would be difficult to speculate Chair because it is one of two things, either the minutes are written badly and maybe they do not reflect what was discussed, or the minutes are written correctly and they reflect what was actually discussed, because - so it is one of those, but then it would seem to me that the happiness that was there was that the confinement was no longer toMitsui, so.     Ja, no Chair I think the matter you raised is quite pertinent and it is an important one because the qualifications of the Board members that go onto this SOE,especially if you get Eskom and Transnet you need heavy technical engineering, economics and finance skills that are required in those kinds of entities.  And in order for it, you know, to succeed, so if you have a Board member who excel in Bible studies, for instance, you might find that they will be good for the Ethics Committee, but they might not be able to make input in the other aspects of the business.      It is correct, there was pressure on attendance. In my recollection, I do not recall that I wasthere when this particular 100 locomotive issue was discussed because you will see that on the agenda that     BB?     Yes.      It may have been discussed before we went in for the 1064.  I cannot remember the sequence of the meeting minutes when I looked at it in terms of what was discussed first.  But I have been more involved on the 64 in terms of what was being discussed on that particular day. Remember that, I had even sent a memo the day before and I was not really sure when I said no, this thingdoes not make sense. I was not sure that I did not know that it was even on the agenda.    Ja.    So I think my comments of yesterday might remain a positive – also took place a long time where I was said these are the kinds of meetings where you spoke when you were spoken to as well but I just do not recall this actual discussion about the 100.    Ja I think it is a wrong conclusion.  There werecertain assumptions I think Mr Singh’s affidavit was indicating that Mitsui had priced based on assumptions that they could use certain existing parts that were in Transnet’s possession.   I do not know how much exactly those were.  It would need to be costed in order for – for a statement to be made. The potential saving – let us assume it was true but I am – I am just saying that the parts need to be taken into account because there is a cost to that I do not know maybe they are worth 600, 800 million or 1 billion I do not know.  But when you look at these things you must also look at the total cost of ownership.  The frequent taking out of locomotives for maintenance and repairs of Mitsui’s actually counter products and that cost.   So you might say I am going to save some money up front if you thought you were saving it is like somebody who buys a bicycle versus somebody who buys a small VW Beetle.  You save some money by buying the bicycle in the front but if you had bought the Beetle you might have been safer and you might reach certain places a little bit faster. So if the total cost of ownership were to be taken into account it is unlikely that the conclusion that Fundudzi reached could be reached.   Because as I have said there were a lot of problems.  In fact I think even now they are still experiencing someproblems with these Mitsui locomotives.    Okay where are we now – which bundle must we go to?    Okay.    BB4.    550.    Sorry I am – page.    Yes.   Yes it is a finance and a pricing related matter.   Now who is Mr Chawbe?    No I do not know.  What does Mr Laher say?    What does Mr Laher say because he was working on the document?  What was Mr Laher’s view?    Oh.  Not very useful.  Okay no I am not able tocomment on what Mr Chawbe said. I do not know him I do not know what he is an expert on.    No not yet.      BB4(b).      I got it.    Yes.    No.    I have no recollection.  This was the final one that went to the board.   Yes.    The – the 38.6 billion did include some – what you call it forex assumption as I understood it.      It did include some – it should have said it excluded borrowing costs because we always excludedborrowing costs and that was always determined later. But certain assumptions around foreign exchange were always made and the 38.6 was a historical number that had been developed I think even at the TFR business case was about 38 billion.  It has some assumptions around foreignexchange.  But it did not have everything.  It did not have borrowing costs and other things but it did include some assumptions around foreign exchange.    That is correct.    It is raining files today Chair.   No we shall not be confused.     Absolutely.    Yes.    Yes.    15   Yes.    Yes.    I think the resolution came with the – what you call it – the business case that was submitted yes.    The statement is not incorrect.  That is why I say it is ambiguous because a lot of people nowadays they are trying to interpret what it means.   Yes.     Ja.  No, the statement is not incorrect.       The statement is correct that it explaining(?) potential effects from forex hedging, forex escalation andother prices escalation.     And that is why I said it is ambiguous because then to some people they think that it would have included all of the forex assumptions.  There were – there was an inclusion of certain forex assumptions but not everything.  So the statement in itself, as adopted by the board on that day, was not incorrect.  That is why I said it is ambiguous because – and it has led to a lot of [laughs] ...[intervenes]      ...consternation because people have tried – are trying to say it was 38.6 billion.  Everything that has to do with forex ...[intervenes]      ...taking into account.     Yes because the world changed.  So let us put it a date on this because I think it is important.     So the date of this is the 25 t h of April 2013.  So there is that discussion.  On the Business Case, youwill see that there are certain assumptions.The assumptions are what is the Rand/Dollar spot rate, and then in there it also gives you an assumption of what is the future.  What is the likely?  Because this is the world of speculation.  What is the likely foreign exchange?  I think it says – I do not have the numbers in front of me but if we go back to that file, Mr Myburgh, where you talked about – I just want to take you very briefly to that.  It is on my statement.     Yes. To the Business Case.  I think that is what will elucidate ...[intervenes]      ...not the issues... [Parties intervening each other – unclear]     Ja.     Okay.  It will be page 435.     Yes.  So Chair that phrase of 38.6 excluding, it is going to resonate right until the end.     So it is there and I am saying there is a source of ambiguity in it because there are people who have come here and said to you the foreign exchange was included and then they have given you the impression that whatever calculation that would have been made on the25 t h of April or the 18 t h of April, to be specific, because that is the date on which the Business Case had been prepared, that the actual exchange rate would remain fixed during that period.  So ...[intervenes]      I do not – just want to assist the Commission in terms of ...[intervenes]      Yes.    H’m.     Ja.     Ja.  No, no that is why Chair I say it is ambiguous.  I think – that is why I say it is ambiguous.  Can I take the Chair to page 442?    H’m.     At the top, it says Forex Risk Mitigation.  Do you see that?    If we – and they tried to explain what it means.  If you go down to the middle of the page, there is somewhere where it says Exhibit 29.     And then it says the Rand/Dollar exchange     All I am saying is that it was understated.     And the fact – and perhaps inaccurate ...[intervenes]      ...in a sense.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     H’m.     Yes.    Yes.     Ye, it was understated.     And hence, there was the effect.     The effect.     Excluding the effect ...[intervenes]      ...of foreign exchange hedging.    The word effect is important.     So all I am saying is that ...[intervenes]      ...the statement in itself is not incorrect, Chair.     It says the effects, because what these people knew was that the numbers are likely to change butI do not think anybody would have assumed to would have known by how much.  So you go on the assumption.  So that is really what I want to say ...[intervenes]      ...based on that.      Yes.    Sorry, what are you saying?     It may have been challenged but as I have said to you Chair, at best we are dealing with ambiguity here.  I know that foreign exchange assumptions were made in the Business Case.  But then there are people who would then want to say to you that because they weremade then it means the numbers must be fixed at 38.6 billion.       Ja.     Ja.     Ja.  So they were made but at the time of the actual contract – so I have said to the Commission in the past few days that there is the investment decision.  Sothere is an investment decision.  It is made at 38.6 billion excluding the potential effects.  I would have probably worded it differently.  I would have said it excludes hedge purging costs and excludes - costs and leave it at that becausepart of the forex is really the effects of the forex.  When you enter into what we then will call the procurement decision, on that day there is a new forward curve of forex that is then used and then it means the effects - the effects is the delta between the forex curve on the date of the procurement decision versus the date of the investment decision.  So that the investment decision is 23 April 2013 or whatever the date was, close to that.  And then the procurement decision is the one that is taken on the17 t h of March of 2014, which is a year later.     Ja.  So I will repeat myself.  I think we should not be dogmatic about this.  The effects – to say excluding the effects.  I do not think there is anything incorrect in that.  The foreign exchange assumptions had been made. They were encapsulated in the actual Business Case.  That was the investment decision that was made on a particular day based on the foreign exchange curve that we have discussed at 422.  Because I will then take you to the documentthat I said was presented by Laher and Smit, where they then come up with a new investment curve – I mean, a foreign exchange curve.       So the assumptions were of the Rand that would remain relatively strong if you look at 422 Chair.  If you look at the numbers.    Except that by 2020, the Rand/Dollar would be R 12.55.     Yes.     Yes.  So and that was taken into account.     In the ...[intervenes]      Ja.  What was not taken into account is this delta that we then are talking about.  In fact, in reality, the Rand the depreciated much, much faster in real life and that then the assumptions that were made here.  And thatis why it is important when you look at this, you must also then reflect on the other document that I referred to which the Treasury Team then produced on the day when the contract was actually entered into.     That is why I have said about six times, yes.     Ja.     Yes.     I am saying to you Mr Myburgh.  To say excluding the potential effects is not incorrect.  That is all Iam saying.     Yes ...[intervenes]      Ja, it is not incorrect Chair.  It just says as of this day things look like this but we do not know the potential effects going forward.     But I know that this thing could have been worded much more eloquently.It was not worded eloquently at all.     No, we are in agreement with that.  There isno need ...[intervenes]      Ja.    No, we do not disagree with that.     [No audible reply]      I do not know.     Yes but perhaps I can be of assistance, Chair.     When Mr Myburgh started, he referred to somebody, Chobe or whatever it is.       And we agreed that I have not had sight of ...[intervenes]      ...over whatever ...[intervenes]     ...testimony, yes.     So what we are saying here is.  It must not then be brought in because we – it is something that I have not seen.  And I am not likely to have any view.  I may have a view.     But I have not seen it.  And Mr Myburgh himself said when he started that he is not going to putthat to me because he knows that I have not seen it, whatever it is that this Chobe or...     Ja.     Yes.     Is it – ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Absolutely.     Yes.     What page is Fundudzi?     Ja.     Okay, I think it is probably based on the minutes.    Yes.     Yes.    That is BB4(b), Chairperson.  Mr Gama, perhaps I should preface this with the following.  Mr Laher also gave evidence that this memorandum was prepared ina similar way to the one in relation to the increase in the ETC of 100 locomotives.  They were prepared roughly at the same time and his evidence was the same as I have described to you and that is that after the conclusion of the LSAs and for a period of a month or two, he liaised with Mr Singh and Mr Singh, I think he even used the word, pedantic, he would provide him with the text, he would provide him with amendments and he would then type it up.  Would you accept that this, as reflected, as him being the first recommender is again like in relation to the 100locomotives the work of Mr Singh?     Ja, it is work of financial people.     Yes.     But I think also importantly, one of the things that I had said is that it also excluded the cost of changes in economic condition.    Between the approval of the business case and the award of the contracts which was highlighted there, ja.     002, yes.    Ja.  No, those things, as I said, they were all included albeit the estimation and the assumptions of the values that were put in the original business case.  They were somewhat understated.     Because that is from the period between the time when the actual business case was made and the award of the contracts.    Ja.     Correct.     The cost of hedging for foreign exchange movement.     The word movement is very important.     Ja.     Yes.    Yes and also the cost of the Transnet engineering that had been excluded in terms of their scope, ja, and then the economic conditions, the changes in economic conditions.     No, I am unable to comment on what theyhave said.  I think I have said my understanding of this.     That is correct, yes.     The only thing that I want to say, I think it is okay for the financial people to discuss this.  The onlything that I want to say from where I see it, Chair, and which is contained in my affidavit is the following.  If you go to my affidavit, page 250.174.     BB28.     250.174.     I have, Chair, entered, I think, into evidence, if you go to 174, 78.11 and I have said that request …[intervenes]     Ja, the paragraph 78.11 on page 174.     That a question that has arisen is how the estimated cost in the investment case, estimated 38, escalated to 49.54 billion because I think those are thetrue numbers that must be compared.  It moved from 38.6 billion to 49.54 billion and then I have said that there was a report that was given to me prior to signature of those memos that Mr Myburgh talks about.  That report was from the finance negotiating team and it is entered here wasSG5 and it appears, Chair, on page 250.200.     Yes, up to page 250.220.  You will see, Chair, at 220 that although this one is not signed because it is – it was an electronic – it is signed by Mr Danie Smit who is the Deputy Treasurer and Mr Yusuf Laher, TFR Finance.  In this document, Chair, is what was explained to me prior to signature of that document that went to the board.  So I just want to say before we rest the matter to then indicate to the Chair that that is the document whichthen contained a breakdown of the final base costs which had moved – the base costs that moved to about 40 billion and then they then allowed all of the other escalations and it went to 49.54 billion.So that was the contract value, 49.54 billion was the contract value which was entered into with all of the OEMs on that date of the 17 March 2014, 49.54 billion.  So it had moved just over 10 billion from 38 to 49.54 billion and then what was then added to that was what is called the 10% contingency which came to about 4.954 somethingsomething and then that then moved it to the 54 billion.  So I am quite happy, Mr Myburgh, that you then deal with it with the finance people, but I just wanted to make sure that I entered this and indicate to you, Chair, in terms of the inputs that were given to me in terms of my signing thatparticular memo to the BADC and the board.     Ja.     The hurdle rates, they are issued by the finance department.     On an annual basis, so Mr Singh is the correct person to speak to.     I think that is what you said that you observed that my signature was not on them, yes.     No, it is fine, I believe you, Mr Myburgh.     Ja.     Ja, I accept that.     Sorry Mr Myburgh ...[intervenes]     Okay you also said something ...[intervenes]      Yes, I think dealt with it in my affidavit, I  have nothing to add, other than what I have said in my affidavit.     BB28.     Maybe it was at the beginning of the file.  Ithink it could be in another affidavit.     Thank you Mr Myburgh.  Before the breakChair we ...[intervenes]      Yes, so if we start at page 250.166 and we go to paragraph 72.1.     Let’s go to line 1, 2, 3, 4, let’s start with the     Yes, so everybody would have increased the prices, these ones were now short-listed because their prices were lower already than the other ones so even if they then went up, even with the other ones, those higherprices would have gone up even higher, so there is no prejudice that you suffer when you’re negotiating with a lower price supplier versus a higher price supplier, and I don’t think that the numbers were you know were big significant sort of numbers but I do know that the supplierdid refuse to stick to the original price when the quantities were reduced.     Let me see.  The final thing Chair that one needs to – because you get MNS and Fundudzi they become experts after the fact and sometimes what is not taken into account is what happened in the negotiation and I think if we just turn to page 250.172 at paragraph 78.9 and sorry, we turn over the page to page 173, in the middleof the page after dealing with the ...[indistinct] I indicate Chair that in addition there was an independent review of the processes.    At 173 yes in the middle of the first paragraph.      Ja, the page number?     Yes.    Yes.     That is correct yes.      When you say the official page ...[intervenes]      No, no let me help you there.     The – as I understand it I think the issuesmay be exactly the same.     The one of 405 I made some comments.     It is an earlier version.    Where I say to the team how does this relate to the delegation by the Board for me to deal with this, as there is no reference to it in this memo, and the I also say to them does this apply to both BT and CNR.     So if an earlier version, it is in May of 2015.     And that is when the team is coming to me to say look please approve the final team to negotiate therelocation.     And they tell me who the people are, and they are saying when we negotiate up to a maximum of this number can we go and negotiate.     Yes.    I find that in June but there is another one that I signed as the formal approval.      After they come back and they say we have now negotiated.    It says I need clarity on one, does this apply to both CNR and BT, number two, the amount referred to 635 is still under negotiation with a question mark.     635million ja, and then three, how does this relate to the delegation by the ADC/Board for me to deal with this matter as there is no reference to it in thismanner, or approved on the basis that the limit in three is not exceeded and I am informed of the final negotiation outcome, so this was to approve that the negotiating team goes in and have further discussions with them.     No you always sign, you always sign, you cansay either approved or not approved.     Ja so I say to them it is approved on the basisthat the amount in three is not exceeded and I am informed of the final negotiation outcomes.     That is correct yes.     No, no, no.      It is not finally approved, but it is an approval of the negotiating team that they can go and negotiate.     Yes, that is correct.     So this one unfortunately I don’t see a date, I am not sure which one came before the other, but I think later on we will make a comparison of them.     Not on that date.     On that date he was the Group Chief Supply Chain Officer.     Yes.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes, right.     Am I too far?    Oh sorry.     Yes.     Ja, I note it, I see it yes.     I see that.     Yes.     I think also what y9ou should say to the Chair is that all of this communication that you are asking me to see and note is between the negotiating team members.    Yes.     Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No.    Ja I have never seen the actual report Mr Goncalves or I do not know how to say his name I think it is Goncalves or Goncalves he did come to say to me that there was this anomaly that there were people that had been paid to negotiate this relocation and that is when I then – we had Werksmans doing investigations within Transnet at that timeso I also asked them to look into this particular matter as well but unfortunately I have never received the final report on that but I did ask that it be investigated.  So if you say there was an amount that you have seen somewhere I am not in a position to deny or confirm it.  But Mr Goncalvesraised it with me very sharply in a meeting.    No.  I do not know anything about it ja.    No I do not know them – I do not who they are.  I was told by Mr Goncalves that they were these people.  I do not know whether they even met with my negotiating team of they were working for CNR I am – I do not know who they are.    You asking me?  I do not know.    I was – I was very surprised I mean I was very, very surprised.    Mr?    No I did not know.    No I did not know.    No.  I do not know how they were resolved.  Iam – I see that Mr Laher was not a signatory to the documents – the negotiation documents but Mr Peter was.    So but all of these memos that you have read to me I have only known about them because of the commission.  So you have sent me these documents.  I was not aware of their existence prior to that.    Perhaps before we do that.    Just as a matter of – of record so that there is clarity on it.  The – the memos that I sign on the 23 rd of July that you referred to one is for CNR and the other one is forBT which is Bombardier.  So what is really in front of me on that day is the amount of 618 million which is for BT and an amount of 647 million well that is the maximum values of 647 million for CNR. So for the approval you are doing a comparison of the two in terms of relocation and thinking they look very close to one another.  That is really what is in my mind at the time when one is signing that particular document.  But also you have a team of five negotiators that have been busy with this for more than a year by the Chair because you come to July 2015 they say they started thenegotiations in 2014.  So that is what is at my mind so I just want to record that at this point before we continue.  Yes Mr Myburgh.    Yes those are the people who signed the memo.    It starts at age 146.    Yes.      Yes.    Maybe just a high level.    I am not going to go into detail onto it.   So the – the relocation is initiated by Mr Vallihu who was the Chief Executive of Transnet Engineering when he writes to Mr Molefe requesting to relocate the assemble line for Bombardier and China North Rail.  Because at theclose of the locomotive tender it had been assumed that everybody was going to manufacture in Pretoria – Kuduspoort.  However CSR and TE already had assemble lines in Pretoria and they only needed to be rigid just a little bit and then they were able to continue with their manufacturing.  With the other two CNR and BT they did not have any assembly facilities so they had to move to Durban.  So – but he puts all of that in his memo to say there are competitions concerns.  You do not want one diesel manufacturer looking over the shoulder of another it is betterto relocate to this other places.  So that is how it starts.The – it ends up with the – the letters that you showed me where after the 23r d of July then wrote back to BR and CNR indicating to them that these are the maximum amounts that were approved for them and that they would be paid periodically.The – so the rationale of all of that I think was well documented and well-motivated by Mr Vallihu in this – in his letters that when they asked for the – for the relocation.So at a time then enter Mr Goncalves where he camethrough with one or two of his other partner and then he informed us that there had been this involvement of BEX – B-E-X or BEX Business Expansion Structure something. And then at that time that is when I then asked that Werksmans investigate I have attached SSG9 the – a letter – a firstreport from Werksmans where they said that they have commenced with the investigation and that they were going to engage with Mr Goncalves so that they can get more information and start with that process.And at some point in the commission you were also informed Chair that there was no relocation.  But I think we can agree that there was a relocation to Wentworth and that is where these two entities were in terms of the relocation program.The obligations for payments where they fell withinthe divisions to then say as and when certain things happened and they should be paid.  But at some point I then decided that since we are doing this investigation and there were these allegations that came about as a result of BEX I then asked the CE of TFR Mr Ravi Nair to stop all payments to these two entities both BT and CNR so that we can have some kind of understanding of what the relocating program amounts were and whether or not we had – they had not been inflated to us.So that was done and they stopped those paymentsand they wrote to – they suspended those payments and they only – they said to them we would only pay you just for the delivery of locomotives and none of the relocation until a time when we are clearer.As I have said to you Chair I am unable to give you afull report because I never saw the – the full report from – what is his name – Werksmans in terms of the finalisation.And also in the – I have also indicated that it has subsequently emerged following the submission of a detailed motivation that during the – and during the commission’s hearings that Yusuf Laher one of the financial executives had raised certain objections and highlighted certain issues of concern which were brought to the attention of the team that was working on the recommendation and does not appear to me that his concerns were ever addressed.But at that time of signing I had no knowledge of his concerns and I had no reason to doubt the bona fide’s of the high level team that was involved in the negotiation of the relocation costs and I had no cause to be concerned at that time up until the time that Mr Goncalves visited me and then that is when I learnt that there was a commission agent that was used.  And so I had just looked at the two amounts that they were almost similar to one another.  But it seems now from what transpired that we probably could have paid less for the – for the CNR portion at least.But each one of them and I have attached for the commission the actual proposal for BT and CNR they are all – they are marked and they are in this particular – I do not know – I do not wish for us to go through them but you will see that they are almost very similar and they are almost onpar with each other.    Yes.    Yes I already traversed them and you didindicate that amongst them there were two issues really there.The first issue was that there had not been any consensus between CNR and its partners – the local partners Goncalves included about the appointment of this BEX.And then the main thing that was significant to me and to Transnet was that in this 2015 proposal I think I was now talking to him in 2017 and he was then saying that look that variation agreement there was the presence of BEX whoend the commission and therefore maybe if they had not been there the costs would have been lower.If you go my paragraph 48.2 then they say they requested the Chief of Legal at Transnet be fully briefed to ensure that investigation is carried out into CNR and BEXinvolvement in the CNR consortium.As I have indicated I however never received a preliminary nor final report from Werksmans who had been instructed in this regards.  Werksmans had advised at the time that there was a delay due to waiting for information from the high value tender teams. But by then we had also taken the decision to stop any further payments to both CNR as well as BT that related to the relocation process pending the outcome of the Werksmans Report.I think that is a fair summary.   Yes with OEM’s yes.    Ja those – those are for after sales service they kick in two or three years after the locomotives have started working because they relate to the maintenance.   BD   Okay.    Okay as it is commission agreements. ADV MYBURGH    No I am not – I was not aware of that either.    Eish.   Ja.  So these – these money flows are monies that have flown to these different letter box companies that you are talking about.    Ja. It is shocking.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.     Yes.    Yes.     Yes.     Yes.    H’m.     Yes.     That is correct.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     [No audible reply]     That is correct.     That is correct.       Yes, I confirm that.     [No audible reply]      No, thank you.  When I wrote this affidavit, I had not been provided with the viva voce testimony of Mosidi but I have, subsequent to that, I think in the past two days or so, have been provided with aspects of it as it relates to that aspect about the Tintswalo Hotel meeting.  Ithink we should call it that.  The context of that meeting, simply Chair, is that Ms Mosidi was new at Transnet and she had signed a document that she did not believe in but had nevertheless signed it and it was in front of me and that, one, that why she had signed a document that she did not believe in because she signed it and then wrote other things next to it.  So...And I have gone through the document but I myself was going through the document and had manyquestions around it.  And I think that is the document she refers to as a document of September or August 2016.I got a sense that she may have been intimidated to sign the document.  [laughs]  Or was not too sure but because she was new and so I got the sense thatmaybe I needed to engage with her and perhaps I could learn(?) from her what the issues were.  I did not want to influence her in any way in terms of whatever decision that she needed to take and I think that she has said to you, Chair, this Commission that she believed so as well.So she had signed this document despite her discomfort.  So I thought that maybe she had been intimidated one way or the other but also I wanted her to have comfort that she can disagree with things and I needed to get a sense of whether she had that courage tobe able to disagree with things and to put facts on her own in order for her to be able to make those decisions.Now I have seen Chair, you have made her, especially when she spoke to you, she changed her statements many times.  [laughs]  Whenever you would ask her questions then she would go with what you thought ...[intervenes]      ...was correct but I think in terms of what you may have wanted but at the end, I think she looked likeshe was prone to some of your influence, Chair.  [laughs]       Ja.     I know.     Ja.     Yes.    Ja.     Ja.     So.  But in any event, I think, as I say, she did change her statements many times.  But the key thing, because I saw there is something – there is a referencewhich is not in the affidavit of hers but there is a reference in the viva voce to a five million or something about danger and all of that and I do not know what she herself probably     Ja.     Ja, I have dealt with it broadly because I do not know how much time you have.     250 point...?     [No audible reply]      I am not there yet, sorry.     Okay, ja.     Ja, I think – I mean, straight up, as Iindicated to you, there was not any discussion about decisions relating to the entities, as she will prove herself in the same viva voce testimony.  If you – so I deny any discussions.  In fact, as I say to you, there is nothing about sharing of money.  At best, I think, what I could have said is.  People are willing to pay lots of money to do surveillance on people who are making decisions about procurement.But really, the context of this is a simple thing which deals with whether she was intimated because I wasvery worries that she had find a document that she did not believe in.  So if you – for instance, if we just – if we go to page 160.     250.430.    Yes.  Sorry, I used the transcript.     Chairperson, I was in – at the bottom there where you had to by references to procurement is dangerous and if you scuttle, that term, that certain peoplemay have already divided the proceeds.  I deny that there was such a discussion.  Then she says no the whole discussion rattled her.  But if you then move further to page – to the next page.  The Chairperson says in the     ...we are going back to the same bundle.     No, I have not come to learn that.  [laughs]     I have read things that are suspected, ja.     No, he did not replace anyone.  There was a new board.  I think there has been this tendency where there is a new board and you get completely new people. But the one that – in the board previously, that is the same role that Mr Sharma had played.       H’m.     Yes, that is ...[intervenes]      Yes.    So at paragraph 42, I just indicate that before the commencement of the – of that ADC meeting, which was on the 13 t h of February, I was requested by Mr Shanewhen I arrived that the meeting be adjourned so that he would have a brief session with me.  So I had a discussion with Shane in the presence of the board’s Chairperson, Mabaso.  Mr Shane indicated that the non-executive directors would vote to overturn the decision and recommendation that had been made by management to award the contract to the FirstRand bidder which was Gijima, this was now after the December discussion that we had had with Mosidi and after she had determined that the risks were actually manageable. Mr Shane indicated that as non-executives they had a right to overturn the recommendations of the management and so to overrule, the two of us, who were the two executives that were members of the board and that the majority of the non-executives could be overruled by them in circumstances where they, as non-execs, believed that management had not properly assessed the risks.And then he then indicated at the board meeting he would also recommend that the decision that had beenmade by management also be overturned because as non-execs they had the right to do that, so that was the whole gist of it because he believed that we did not assess the risk properly.  So during that meeting I then outlined to Mr Shaneall of the processes that had taken leading to the decision to award the IT data services tender to Gijima and I indicated that there was adjudication, there was a lot of discussions that took place amongst the people and that the decision had not been taken lightly, we had taken it after following proper and due processes.He indicated that no, look, his reading of that whole process was that T-Systems would have won this tender had it not been for the fact that Ubuntu Technologies had withdrawn at some point.And then he then had certain concerns about Gijima that he came up with and in particular he said look, you could wake up tomorrow morning and Transnet cannot even send an email because you have got a new contractor.  That would be a disaster to the reputation of Transnet just as an example.The meeting became and tense and he said to us – to me, look, it does not really matter what we as management thought about Gijima and that he thinks that T-Systems should continue with this because in any eventthe ultimate decision lay with the board and not with us and he did not want to expose Transnet to any form of risk.So I indicated to him that look, it would be difficult to change that decision and there would be consequences because that decision conflicted with the outcome of a dueprocess.  So we then resumed with the meeting at the ADC and then Mosidi and Thomas then came in.  We granted them the opportunity to make their verbal submissions.  I did not tell them that I had had this meeting which wanted to overturn the decision.  So they came in in support of a decision to award to Gijima and they continued to support that recommendation because that was the outcome and I was hoping that maybe Shane would have considered or reconsidered his stance in terms of overturning thatparticular decision.It was a long drawn out meeting, there was a lot of talk and discussions.  At the end when Mosidi was persisting, you know, a lot with the argument, I then sent to her that SMS to say look, we may have to look at other ways to deal with this, it is not going to help if you continue to argue in this case because it was clear to me that there was not anything that was going to change the Chairperson’s mind around this particular thing, he was convinced that it needed to change.    It was more led by Mr Shane as the Chairperson of the committee.  Ja.    So I then say at paragraph 43 that    Ja, I have got it.     Yes, I think the issue of the risks that had been identified, the court would have felt and we agreed with it that the risks did not amount to objective criteria.     Yes.     Of the Mosidi file?    Yes.     No, I am not aware of it.  As you say this is what has been established but I think it is quite shocking ifit is true that there were these types of things that were happening.   Chair, I think one of the things that we had started to do at Transnet before I left were to look at a list of some of these vendors and – because there were lots ofallegations in terms of different entities and I opened at the Hillbrow police station on the 21 November 2017 to look at all of the allegations that had levelled especially against entities that were doing business with Transnet.   But I think what one had found was that Transnet itself did not appear to have been paying Commissions to anybody but that it was entities that were contracted to Transnet that were paying outside people and it seemed that there was a modus operandi that seemed to indicate that perhaps there were internal people, I do not knowwho, who provided information to these entities in terms of saying maybe you are going to be awarded this tender.   In order for you to be awarded this tender, you know, we think have influence and then these people maybe were gullible.  It would just seem that there was some kind of information that would leak to third parties because all of these entities, most of them that were being paid, that were recorded as being paid, they did not do any business with Transnet.   So our people had made those preliminaryinvestigations that – I mean, those preliminary findings, our auditors, internally, that there was such a thing but we could not pin down in terms of who and how and where some of this seemed to be happening because we could also not find that in terms of the procurement processesthemselves that there was something amiss in terms of maybe inflation of prices.   The process seemed to go well inside the tender process but there still emerged all of these entities that seemed to have been paid by contractors of Transnet.  The contractors were paid to third parties.  Obviously at Transnet we could not police that because we did not know but those were some of the preliminary things that we found.     But I do not know that actual people or the individuals that would have been involved.     Yes.     Which page are you at?     Okay.       You know Mr Myburgh when Mr Mohamedi came here he was very desperate to ingratiate himself with the Chairman of the Board of Transnet, because he was acting GCE and he wanted to be appointed as the GCE,and he may have in his frustration given you a lot of things that sounds to me like a man who was there but then starts saying no there was this and this, I have investigated this, but never said anything when it was happening, wanting to give you the impression that he was a bystander, an innocent one.If you go to the Treasury note I don’t know this treasury note whether it applies to Transnet, I have never seen it and it says 2008/2009, Transnet is a Schedule 2 entity.  This applies to Schedule 3A, 4B, 3C and 3D entitiesin terms of the PFMA, so I don’t know whether any of this thing applies to Transnet or not, because what you have put here before me is for Schedule 3 entities.The second issue that I want to indicate it is quite normal for entities that we do audit work, we also do non-12 MAY 2021 – DAY 393audit work, provided that the audit committee agrees that they should do, and also it limits the amount of work that they should do, so by the time you see this it might have been presented to the Acquisition Committee, it is at the recommendation of the Audit Committee to say let us use this entity.  Nkonki used to be a very good brand, at the beginning of time and I am sure its founders would also agree and the directors and workers who worked there would also agree.   But obviously at a point in time we then learnt that it had gone rogue in one way or the other, therewere those allegations.  At the time when we learnt that it had gone rogue we terminated the contractual relationship between Transnet, I terminated that contractual relationship between Transnet and Nkonki when we learnt that something could be amiss, because we also needed protect the reputation of Transnet.  I don’t know whether the Auditor General terminated before us or not but I suspect we terminated even before the  Auditor General.And at the time according to Mr Mohamedi anamount of R26million had been spent on the work that had been agreed for them to do.  There was quite a stringent manner in which anybody could be paid, I hear there’s a lot of discussion about innovation or innovative but as I said Transnet is a Schedule entity in terms of the PFMA, I don’tknow if this applies to Transnet, I have never seen it, but because the documents that we sign are also signed by compliance people, and they would have known before it came to me they would have known whether it or not this could be done or not, so I don’t know Chair.    I think Transnet did have a policy to deal withunsolicited proposals, and I don’t know how this proposal actually came about, but there was a policy I couldn’t – I wouldn’t be able to say to you that this was an unsolicited proposal or not, I wouldn’t be able to say to you whether it was not from the people that went to Nkonki to say look since you are inside and you are trying to do certain things maybe you would be better able to do this you know to do this, I don’t know the genesis of this particular thing.     Ja, I think you would have to put one that schedule 2 so that we would know, because we can spend a lot of time discussing something that where Transnet is excluded.  Personally I have never seen this but it says 08/2009 which is 12 years ago.     Again Chair I don’t know to whom this was applicable to, but I have a recollection at a point in time where these deviations or variations where some of these notes took place, that there were representations to the National Treasury in terms of saying is it the 20% or is it the 20million or the 15% or the 15million, because for anentity as large as Transnet if it is at 15% it is understandable, it is acceptable, you do get involved with those kinds of things, but in terms of construction related goods Transnet had its own set of rules that had been approved, that were different, so any application to Transnet of this I don’t know.   I have just forgotten what it was called, something, something E, I can’t remember, or construction related, but an amount of 15million or million variation for contracts, I mean let’s take the IT data term that we have just been talking about.  It wasabout 1.8billion.   If you applied 15% of it, it would take you to about 240million, so – but if you then said no it is the 20million or the 20% then you started getting into some difficulties, so some of these things are a bit difficult, and I don’t know as we sit here about applicability because as Iam saying the memo’s that I am looking at, the compliance people have signed them in, and they always had the duty to then say can this be done or not and we take the cue from them as well that before you do the business transaction the compliance has looked at it, so I don’t know Chair in terms of applicability, but I do know that there was a huge protest at some point around the 20% or million which one is applicable because if your contracts were R100million or less then it makes sense but for the big contracts and then a lot of the things the contractswere bigger than that.     The higher or ...     250 point?     This is in relation to Nkonki?     Yes, I indicate that that memo emanated from the GCFO and it was supported by the Chief Legal Counsel of Transnet, and that was the typed signatory to it, and it was submitted to the acquisition and disposals committee,it was a project which was part of the cost savings and efficiency drive for the optimisation of supply chain management within Transnet and we had hoped that we could save up to R5billion per annum.The proposal had first been taken to the Audit Committee as I have already indicated, to permit Nkonki to perform certain non-audit related services.   I have dealt with some of those issues, part of the issues with this renegotiation of the Kumba Iron Ore contract, the Anglo American contract in terms of which this evergreencontract with Kumba they paid market related rates for portions of the iron ore haulage which rates were significantly below the market price that Kumba’s competitors such as Assmang were paying for the same service.We estimated that an additional R1 billion per annum could be paid by Kumba to Transnet and in fact since 2005 per annum those amounts would have been recoverable and Kumba had failed to regularise the – this position ostensibly relying on the contract with Transnet and the termination date saying that they only want to deal with it in 2028 when the existing contract expires.So this was as a result of that contract which had been entered in a hurry and in haste in 2005 which we believed was exclusionary and anti-competitive to transportiron ore to Saldanha. And really what Transnet was trying to do at that time was to remove and embed a derivative on the original pricing mechanism which was linked to the US Dollar and therefore certain – it gave rise to certain embedded derivatives.So the – the funding for this work it was emphasised that once the cost savings had been raised then the people    No.    Of Nkonki.   No, no you saying Trillian had acquired     Yes.    Yes no we have dealt with that issue yesterday.  No what I am saying Trillian acquiring Nkonki because remember Nkonki is a firm of accountants and auditors.  So for me it would be – it would have been absurd that such athing had happened but it was widely reported in the newspapers afterwards but I did not know when it happened.  But at the time when we terminated those were part of the considerations that enabled us to terminate the relationship.   Sorry.    I do not know.    Whether it was unsolicited I have said to youbefore that it may even have been Transnet’s people that thought they were appoint – approaching an accounting firm that could assist them.  I did not know anything about the solicitation or otherwise that is why I was not going to comment on something I do not know.    Yes.    I think he was one of the three people that we had said last time that he could have been involved.  He was a general manager at the Transnet port terminal.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes but it is irrelevant for our purposes is it not.    Why?    Sorry.    There would have been a delegated authority between the 15 t h of June to the 21 s t of June.    This is a different matter.  It falls outside the dates that we are dealing with and therefore it is irrelevantfor our discussion.    Yes but it is for the wrong period Mr Myburgh that is all I am saying.    I do not know what is the relevance of this?    Yes.    Yes.    You have not given me an opportunity to go and check that.  Did you ask me to check that?  I have not.    Sorry – no I was in Russia between the 15 t h ofJune and the 21 s t of June.    In St Petersburg and then I came back to the country.    Yes.    No it is not.    I asked Mr Karl Socikwa who was the CEO of (inaudible).    I asked Mr Karl Socikwa who was the CEO of the Transnet port terminal.    To act in my position and to represent me at this.    Yes.  He was unable to do so he requested Mr Ndlovu he gave him the speech that would have been made there and Mr Ndlovu made the speech at this place.  And that speech was made on the 20t h of June 2015.    Yes.    250.450.    Okay I thought they have just attached the document at the back of this thing here.    Is it not easier to …   Yes.      Sorry let us – this 250.    250.341.  I think it is the same document.    At 250.450. Mr Myburgh yesterday you – yousaid you wanted to ascertain that it came it from the hotel.    It says that the balance in this thing is nil.    And you – you said that is not what you are –you are contesting – you are contesting the fact that you are agreeing that it came from the hotel so I have given you the emails.    Ja.     Sorry can I just say to you that that document it has a date on it.  The date is on the date that I checked out.  It says on the 24t h of January 2016 paid.  There is the amount and it says the balance in AED nil.  That is what that document says.   Ja.    Ja I see this document for the first time now but yes that is my signature.   Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    No I did not.    I did not.  Not at all.    As we sit here we sit here with the benefit of hindsight where people say how could so many have not known because one was not involved in it.  One was just working doing their work not knowing that there is anything in the background.   Ja that is what the money flow teams as you say have found out.  I have said to you earlier that my own sense with a lot of these was that the processes themselves were followed properly inside the NDT but that our contractor had commission agreements with third parties and something that we ourselves probably could not have been able to police orwe did not understand and we did not know anything about it. That is what I have said.    No it does not go and on and on.  It is somebody that I have met three or four times which I have told this commission.  I did not know any other thing that he does other than what he said he does.  I have not had any relationship of any sort or nature with him.  I do not know what it is and I am not familiar with all of these money flows and the money laundering and all of that aspects of him.  Hehas not shared, it was not what we discussed.  And you would also see that entities that he was involved in, when certain things happened that I believe imputed the integrity of Transnet, they terminated those contracts.  Not once.  I have told you about terminating the Regiments’ contract in 16 and the Trillian’s contract in 2016.  And when Nkonki issue arose, I also terminated that contract.  So I do not think that those are the actions of something who was in any way, form in cahoots with the so-called Mr Essa.    And that was not me.       Yes, it was not me.  I was not involved in that.     Yes, what about the evidence of my driver?     Yes, I have indicated to you about the driver, that sometimes he uses real events that took place and then he puts flavour into it and then he alleges that certain things that did not happen, he says that is what happened.  I have dealt with those issues.  I have shown you where he supposes I could have been at two places at the same time.  So...  And I have also shown the Chair that there are other motives in as far as the driver is concerned.  I have indicated those issues and I have shared it very freely with the Chairperson.    Ja, I can only talk about myself.  I cannot talk about other people.  It is me that I talk about.  It is me that I know.  I cannot talk for other people.     You would have to put those things to Mr Gigaba himself and find out the truthfulness or otherwise of those issues with him.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Yes, it is something I shared ...[intervenes]      ...with the Commission, yes.  You can take it as read.     It will be difficult.     I am saying it will be difficult for me, just going through this in lightning speed.     ...anything has been omitted or not.     Yes.
GAMA:Ja.I am saying there was forex ...[intervenes]    In terms of some of the viva voce ...[intervenes]  
ADV OLDWAGE:   Mr Chair, I ...[intervenes]      I have been rather patient listening to Mr Myburgh put it to Mr Gama that various other persons have said certain things.  It started initially with MrChawde – if my pronunciation is correct – said X, Y, Z.  There is no reasoning to provide the basis upon which that testimony was proffered in the first place.  What we clearly see now is that there is a different appreciation, approach and perhaps interpretation to the concept, what was and what was not included.  But     Be fair to Mr Gama.     Chair ...[intervenes]     I am startled by this submission that this is not contentious when the witness said but it isambiguous.  It is capable of more than one interpretation.  Do not insist on one interpretation alone.  I am telling you.  There is a reason I say that it is ambiguous.  How can that not be contentious with respect?  It does ...[intervenes]      Mr Chair, with respect.  I have nodifficulty with that.  I settled this affidavit.       The position is.  I – my complaint relates to what is being put to Mr Gama with reference to the testimony of other persons and he will, no doubt, understand that he has got to consider his position very carefully to simply acknowledge that it is right or wrong without knowing the context within which that evidence was given.       Thank you, Mr Chair.     Chair if I might be of assistance, it was dealt with in – with reference to the evidence of Mr Callard and in particular his statement.    And that is to be found, it commences at page ...[intervenes]      250.148.     It is BB28.     Indeed, page 250.148, that’s where we commence dealing with Mr Callard’s ...[intervenes]      250.148     250.148.     Indeed.     I will find it for you shortly, but I don’t want to waste your time Mr Chair, if  a short adjournment is appropriate we would appreciate that.    Chair this is – this is ridiculous.  It really is ridiculous in the extreme and I must object to what is being put here.Firstly let us consider where this document camefrom.  There is no signature appended to this document by virtue of when it was created.  Surely Mr Myburgh must understand that that is the answer to this ridiculous proposition that he is putting.Secondly these accounts do not reflect who actually made the payment.  So you cannot put that proposition with the greatest of respect.    Mr Chair this is – Mr Myburgh is not getting my objection.  He is missing the point with respect.    I am saying simply this.    He has accepted that this emanated from the hotel.  That was…    That was his submission last night.  In the ordinary course a document like this would not indicate that. That is the first issue.    Who – in fact if you have regard to when this document was created.On Mr Myburgh’s own submission it would not reflect who had made this paymentbut no invoice issued by a hotel reflects who actually made the payment because there is no provision for it.    No Mr Chair.    Yes.   No there was a schedule that was forwarded to the as I understood it the CEO of Sahara Computers and that was calling for payment of three hotel bills by three individuals.  So that is something different.  But there is something more concerning about this.  This commission has wide ranging powers.  I find it strange that it is not put to Mr Gama that the hotel is in fact confirmed that he has not paid this bill because it is clear what Mr Myburghis driving at here.  That Mr Gama is not being truthful about payment of this account.    He is driving at Mr Chair with respect.    Mr Chair, I think in fairness to Mr Gama. He must be given an opportunity to consider.  He should not be under pressure now to make that determination.  There is the issue of re-examination which I will address you on in a moment when I have that opportunity but he will consider his position and as advised to your responseby way of either an affidavit or the re-examination... [Speaker ’s voice drops – unclear]     Mr Chair, there certainly will be a need for Mr Gama to place additional evidence before the Commission.  There is no formal agreement.     But we wish to take advantage of your offer.     That we reduce to writing in a form an affidavit that which in the ordinary course ...[intervenes]     ...constitutes re-examination.     I have taken those instructions.     We will be doing so.     So we are simply making use of that invitation by you for us to submit such an affidavit in view of re-examination.    Thank you.     [No audible reply]     Mr Chair, would – bearing in mind that we would like to consult the transcripts of the proceedings and the evidence of other witnesses that have been referred to during my client’s questioning, might I suggestthe 4 t h of June?     To comply with that?  Regrettable, I am away and I am in other matters and I am also away fromJohannesburg.  So the 25 t h, which is – it gives us six working days, Mr Chair.     If I might then ask?     But I am not testing your patience.     But I also have a busy schedule.     Or that we do it by the 28 t h.    It gives us to extra days.     Thank you, Mr Chair.
