CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Wentzel, good morning everybody.      Are we ready?  Yes.  Mr Khuba you will continue to give evidence on the strength of the oath that you took two days ago.  Okay.      Thank you. Alright.  Continue.    I am sorry Ms Wentzel I did not hear the question and the reason I did not hear it is because I saw what they have written on your name tag there.  Did you see that?    It says you are Advocate Wentzel SC.    Okay yes.  Do you want to repeat the question so I can hear it?    I think let us always as far as possible refer to them as either the first report, the amended report or the second report so it would be clear which one we are talking about.    Hm.    Before we go further on that point.  Let us go back to the point that – to the answer that you just gave earlier to Ms Wentzel’s question.  I understand from the report of Werksmans or Werksmans do you know whether they prefer to be called Workmans or Werksmans?    Okay, alright.  It seems from that report of Worksmans or Werksmans that the report says that when they interviewed Mr McBride he said that he had not seen the first report when he signed the second report.  But they say that you contradicted him when they interviewed you and in this regard if I am not mistaken they say that you – he had – you said he instructed you to retrieve the docket and from that they seem to infer that he must have seen the first report.  Did you say to them that he had seen the first report?    Of the first report?    Who might have handed it to – oh.    Yes.    He did or not.    Yes.    But the short answer is that you do not know whether or not Mr McBride did see the first report before signing the second report?    Yes.  He may or he may not you do not know?    Okay.  Thank you.    And do you know whether Mr McBride saw the amended report before signing the second report?    Okay.    And what was her response to that?    Hm.    Hm.    Okay and therefore you would – would you have the – even the exact date when you received these calls or not the dates?    Yes.    Mr McBride?    Hm.    But it was March?    But it was March 2015?    Yes okay so you…    So you received a call from the Minister himself Mr Nhleko?    Yes and what – what did he say in the telephone call?    Oh.  At that stage had you been – had Werksman been in touch with you at that stage?    They had been in touch with you.    But had you had an interview with them already or not yet?   Yes.    Interview.    Yes.    The Executive Director.    Oh.  And what did the – what was their response when you referred them to the Executive Director?    Hm.    Hm,    Hm.    Hm.  And when you – if you look at the time when you had that interaction with Werksmans and the time or the date when the Minister spoke to you and said he wanted you to cooperate with Werksmans did – how much time had elapsed? Do you have a recollection?  A week, two weeks, a few days?    Was that like in a few days’ time after the call?    Yes.    Yes.    Oh but maybe around a month or so after the call.    Less than a month?    Weeks ja.    Okay.  So did you get the impression that Werksmans had reported to the Minister that you had referred them to Mr McBride when they wanted to – you to come for an interview?    Hm.    Hm.  And he must have formed the view that you were not cooperating with them?    And thought it was necessary that he should make the call personally to you and – actually he had wished to have a meeting with you.    In Cape Town.    The call must – he must have made the call because you kept on saying that you would need Mr McBride’s permission.    Yes, no, no I understand that completely but obviously she was conveying to you what the Minister had asked her because she was the PA’s Minister and she was – I am saying she it could have been a he – was – had been sent by the Minister to call you and ask you come to Cape Town.  Otherwise the PA would not say come to Cape Town unless the Minister wanted you to come to Cape Town.    Yes.  And was this the first time that you spoke to – you were speaking to the Minister?    Yes.  But he – what he had to say was just brief.  I want you to cooperate with Werksmans.    When he came on the – when he phoned – were you phone by his PA who then said please hold on for the Minister or did he phone and you picked up the phone – the call.  You did not know the number and he said this is the Minister of Police or I am Nathi Nhleko the Minister of Police I would like you to cooperate with Werksmans.  How did it – how did he introduce himself to you?    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Well was that on a cell phone or on a landline?    A cell phone okay.  So how did he start the conversation with you?    Ja in what way?    Hm.    Okay.    With his voice yes.  And then he just said he would like you to cooperate with – with Werksmans.    Yes.  Okay thank you.    I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  Did you see the direct approach by the Minister to you as opposed to him talking to the Executive Director to pass on the message to you as something unusual or strange or did you see nothing unusual?    And Mr McBride never told you anything along the lines that the Minister did approach him to ask him to release you to go and see him in Cape Town?    And if he – if that had happened he probably would have told you?    Did you get any impression that the Minister was trying to bypass the Executive Director on this matter – on the Rendition matter?    Hm.  Okay.    Is that Mr Kgamanyane?    Oh in his chambers.    Okay.  Ja.    Had you seen – I am sorry.  Had you seen the Minister’s affidavit that you – that he was asking you to – to sign a confirmatory affidavit about.    Yes.    Oh But what – how – how could you say if you signed a confirmatory affidavit you would be lying if you had not yet seen what the Minister’s affidavit said or was saying?    In the media.  Yes.    And in brief what was the version that you had seen in the media being attributed to the Minister?    Hm.    Hm.  Okay.    Were they recording you?    Yes.  So from their recording whatever you said in terms of this issue should appear?    Do you know whether it does appear in their transcripts or have you not had a chance to…    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.  Did you ask for the audio and they did not provide it or did you not ask for it?    Yes okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.  Ja.  But do you have a clear recollection whether when you raised that issue namely could this result in me being disciplined or being charged. Do I need a lawyer here?  Do you have a clear recollection that at that stage the recording was on because it – it having been a first thing – the first thing you raised it may well be that you raised it before the proceedings started formally and therefore it might not have been captured?    Hm.    Your one as opposed to Mr Sesoko’s one?    Ja.    Yes.    Hm.  Hm.  But – but is your answer to my question that you do know that it was recorded and therefore if the audio recording could be accessed it will be there or it should be there or are you saying you are not sure?    Well – I am sorry before you do that.  You see my question is whether if we get the recording we are likely to find it there unless there has been interference.  As far as you know and that depends  1. On whether you know that when you raised that point the recording had started or you do not know?    Yes.    Yes or whether the recording was on.    Or not.    Yes.  But you said something earlier on about them saying we are on record.    Was that before you raised the point?    Hm, ja.    The recording?    Yes, but what I am asking is whether when - as far as you can remember - when they said we are on record …    Whether that was before or after you had raised the point to say do I need a lawyer to - to represent me here.  Am I at risk for a disciplinary charge or a criminal charge?    Hm.    Okay, okay.  Thank you.  I think attempts should be made to try and get the record - the audio.    Ja.    Okay.    Before you deal with the report Ms Wentzel.    You will recall that yesterday I indicated that I would like Mr McBride, Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba to look at the report properly and submit affidavits that deal with the findings of the report and the reasons given for the findings relating to them.  Now I do not know whether in regard to Mr Khuba you propose to deal with those issues with him now while he is on the witness stand or whether you intend - you propose to let him also go and do that - submit that an - an affidavit that does so of course with him, Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko if there is a need for anyone of them or all of them to be called back to deal with that aspect that can be done.  Have you applied your mind as to how you propose to deal with it?    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Affidavit.    Hm.    The report?    Yes.    Oh, okay.    Okay.    No, no that is …    That is fine.    That is - this fine and Mr Khuba you are ready to deal with this report …    Properly?    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes, yes.  Well of course when things were still fresh it would mean that you had a better recollection …    Of what had happened?    So - so you said something about if you have more time.    Oh, okay.    Yes, okay.  Okay.    You have not had time to do that comprehensively of late?    Yes, yes.    Yes, yes.    You prefer to have more time?    Yes, yes.    Yes.    No I - I would be - I - I would want you to do that because you see that report is important with regard to the role of Werksmans on this whole issue and I will give Werksmans an opportunity.  I think Mr July will need to be called to give evidence and to give their side of the story with regard to how they handled this and the conclusions that they reached in the - he reached in the report but I - I would like you, Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride to really look at the - the report.  How it dealt with issues. What it says about each one of you and what findings it makes?  What the reasons are that given for each finding against you and against the material that Werksmans had before the remuneration to - what statements did they have?  What documents did they have you know on which their findings were supposed to be made. So - I - I would be inclined to give you that opportunity because also the - because I think that the Minister and Mr Kgamanyane or the Minister must have made the decisions to suspend or was it the - the Acting Director.  I cannot remember now who made the decision to suspend the three of - the three of you - must have made that on the basis of that report and the three of you were put through quite a difficult situation and - and I would like you to be able to deal with it quite properly so that when I evaluate all the evidence about how the three of you were dealt with and how the Minister - what role the Minister played, what role Werksmans played, what role Mr Kgamanyane played and everybody. I have a full picture.  So that - that is what I am inclined to do.  What do you say Ms Wentzel?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    No that is fine.  That is fine.    100-and …?    Yes.    Yes.    May - maybe what one can ask is whether Werksmans at any stage before the interview started told you what their terms of reference were.    You cannot remember?    Yes.  Okay.  Do you know when for the first time you saw in writing what their terms of reference were?  Whether it was when you saw the - their report for the first time or whether you got to know the terms of reference at some stage as they are put here.    Oh.    Yes.    Yes.  Okay, alright.  Thank you.    What page?    Hm.    Hm.    But who - who said that Mr Mosing was the person who was going to guide the investigation?  Who came with that - from whom did you hear that for the first time?    Hm.    Hm.    And Mr Mosing was one of them?    And did you initiate communication between the two of you or did he call you at some stage or is that something you cannot remember?    Oh, okay.    And you confirmed from him that he was - he had a role in this investigation and that role was to guide the investigation?    Yes.    Hm.    Okay, okay and that is how you then cooperated throughout?    Was it the first time that you were involved in an - in an investigation under IPID where a member of the NPA was playing an active role during the investigation?    Okay.  Thank you.    Hm.    Page - page 200.    What paragraph?    Have you got it Mr Khuba - the paragraph?    Okay.    Well Ms Wentzel that would form part of what he is going to deal with.    Yes.    Did you have a look at - at the statute?    I - I suggest you have a look at it first.    Before you ask him …    Because that will be much more helpful.  I saw something quoted in the - in the Werksmans Report which may be relevant to what he was saying and it might - I did not understand it to be consistent with what he said but he will get a chance to deal with everything that refers to him here in the report by way of an - of an affidavit and he will have a chance - he will have had a chance to reflect on everything and probably he will need to come back after submitting that affidavit and then he deals openly with all of these issues. So - so it seems to me that as far as the report is concerned we should not go further.  Let him go and …    Do that homework.  Submit that affidavit.    Then we will call him again.  Then he can deal with all of these issues and in the meantime also Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko can do the same but as far as other matters are concerned I think you can still ask other questions if there are other matters other than the contents of the report.    To the report.    Yes.    Yes.    Okay.  No that is fine.  Would that then place us a stage where I can release him …    For now?    Not - ja, okay.    I thought you said there was nothing else.  It was just the report you wanted to deal with.    Yes.  Not that is fine.    You can - you can deal with them, ja.    Of his affidavit?    What page?    Yes.    The Executive Director?    Yes.    And what did he say?    Okay.    And when she - when you say at that time that - which I - I take - I assume you mean at the time she phoned you.  You say it was very late.  Around what time would you think it was?    Yes.  To - to go to Limpopo?    Yes, okay.  Continue.    Ja.    Yes.    Your recording?    Ja.    Ja.    So where she said the Minister wanted you to receive the letter of suspension that day was that captured in the recording as well?    Yes.  Do you have any idea why if the decision to suspend you was that of the Acting Executive Director namely Mr Kgamanyane why the Minister would have an interest that you receive the letter of suspension on that day?  What did that have to do with him?    Was just being an instrument.      These were decisions being taken by the Minister?    The Executive Director.      Yes, if you had not -  you say if you had not received this call – the call from the Minister directly earlier on it would have been another issue, what do you mean, how would you have taken this interest of the Minister in you being served with a letter of suspension on a particular day?      Yes.      So the letter of suspension and I know I’m jumping now, the letter of suspension was signed by Mr Kgamanyane?      Suspending you.      But the Chief Director, Miss Nitsiyanda who came to serve it – who called you to say he had a letter to give to you said that the Minister wanted this letter served on you on the particular day, is that right?      And – okay and you say when the call came it was around – it must have been around three in the afternoon.      So you said you would wait for her.      Okay continue.      I’m sorry I think he – you don’t want him to continue how Miss Nitsiyanda then reached Limpopo and served first or is there something that you want to deal with before that?    Oh okay.    253?     I’m sorry, maybe just in case we didn’t ask this.  You confirm that substantially this transcript reflects the conversation that took place between you and Miss Nitsiyanda?      Okay, thank you.      Now Miss Wentzel you said something earlier on about, I think in response to which Mr Khuba may have said that he would need to go back to the people who transcribed that conversation, or did I misunderstand?  In response to which he – I understood him to be saying he would go to the people who made the transcription.      What was that about, it seems to be quite – especially with the affidavit, I’m not sure if we need anything further?    Yes ja I don’t think so because the person who had a conversation with Mr Khuba has confirmed in an affidavit the relevant part.    Ja.      Or maybe let’s connect it to where he was before we went to the transcript.  Miss Nitsiyanda left Pretoria and drove to Pretoria to serve the letter on you, is that right?      Polokwane yes and she served you with the letter.      In the conversation that the two of you may have had is there anything of importance that you want to mention?      Around what time in the evening?      Okay.      Well from Pretoria to Limpopo is it not about three hours or is it two hours?      Okay.      But other than that there’s nothing of consequence that transpired in the conversation when you met with her?      A suspension letter.      Did the letter of suspension or did the news that you’re being suspended come as a shock to you or not really?      Okay thank you, have we got the letter of suspension here?      Let’s go through it.      Well I think it appears from the first paragraph of the letter that we might have skipped a step earlier.  Prior to you receiving the letter of suspension did you receive a letter in terms of which you were asked to make representations why you should not be suspended.      Yes, and did you consult with attorneys who helped you to prepare such representations?      Yes, and you submitted the representations to Mr Kgamanyane?      Yes, and the letter that had asked you to make those representations had come from Mr Kgamanyane, the letter that asked you to make representations, did it come from him?      Yes, yes I get the impression in making that point you are emphasising that the decisions might not have come from him but the correspondence was coming from him.      Okay alright, you think the decisions were coming from where?      Okay alright, did - and Miss Wentzel have you got that letter here, the letter that preceded the letter of suspension?      Because we should also have a copy of the representations that he made.      We don’t have them either here?      Would you have that letter somewhere and the representations somewhere?      Ja from your lawyer.      Ja try and get those and send them to the legal team because it will be important to see what was said in that letter to which you needed to respond and to also see how you responded in order to evaluate the decision – the decision to go ahead and suspend       Yes, no that’s fine.      I’m so you were called to a disciplinary inquiry and effectively a senior counsel Advocate William Mokare SC and a junior counsel Mr Thembetha Nkatube [?] instructed by Morgan Lourens Attorneys were appointed effectively to be the prosecutors to prosecute you in the disciplinary inquiry, is that correct?      Had there been any disciplinary inquiries of IPID personnel before – before he disciplinary inquiries of yourself and Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko?      Did they – did IPID always bring senior counsel to prosecute its staff in disciplinary inquiries?      Yes, I mean senior counsel is very high level of an Advocate somebody who has – usually who has been an Advocate for many years and somebody who is very good and somebody also who doesn’t come cheap.      But is your answer that there had been disciplinary inquiries involving IPID personnel before this and the organisation had brought outside lawyers but not at the level of senior counsel, is that what you’re saying?      Yes, a heavyweight but did they always or often or sometimes bring an outside lawyer?      Yes.      The ones that you can remember, namely disciplinary inquiries that had happened before your one and Mr McBride’s one and Mr Sesoko’s one you would think would have been how many more or less that you can remember that had happened, two, three, more or less even if it’s not an exact number?      Any senior lawyer from outside?      Yes, but do you know whether they brought any lawyer from outside at all or only internal people were used?      Because that’s the important part, whether it was the first time that outside lawyers were brought to – in regard to disciplinary inquiries when your inquiry, Mr Sesoko’s inquiry, Mr McBride’s inquiry happened or whether it was not the first time but it had happened before but rarely but even then not senior lawyers such as these?      Okay during the interval that is going to be there before you come back, please find out that information, how many disciplinary inquiries had there been before your one and Mr McBride’s one and Mr Sesoko’s one, did it involve outside lawyers who were there, what was their level and so on.      Okay thank you.      And the Chairperson was Advocate Mojana?      Yes, okay.      He’s a lawyer so he would be an Advocate or an attorney you’re not sure?      Ja okay.      I’m sorry just repeat, he said, bru if you what they’re going to fire you, they say if what they’re going to fire you?      With the hearing?    Yes.          Okay just repeat that because it’s important, you said something about no matter what, just repeat exactly how he put it to you?      As you were preparing for…[intervenes].     He was confident yes.      Yes but now he said this is what they’re saying.    Hm.    hm.    Hm.    Hm.      Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Hm.    Hm.    To settle.    Yes.    And this is the same lawyer who as you are preparing to come the disciplinary hearing was saying this is a walk in the park.    Who was very confident?    Yes.      Hm.  Trying to get…    Other people’s views and so on.    Hm.    At this stage as you were making these calls had your lawyer told you whether there was an offer on the table that they were putting – these – the employer was putting on the basis of – on the basis of which they were saying let us settle this matter.  Or at that stage they just wanted to find out whether in principle you would be agreeable to talk in settlement but – and if you were agreeable they were still going to come up with an offer?    Ys.    Yes    Yes.    Hm.    Did you say what you would need to admit to in order for them to give you a warning or what it is they wanted from you?  Because I – I assume if you were going to give – to be given a warning you were going to be required to admit that you are guilty of something?    Hm.  What was that?    Hm.    Yes.    On the first day of the hearing.    Yes    So before you – I take it the disciplinary hearing was adjourned to enable you to go and sleep over the matter.  Around what time of the day was it after you had been making calls to various people and there have been discussions between the Advocates?    And they – and you had met at what time – in the morning at the disciplinary hearing?    But it was in the morning?    So…    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    And the matter was adjourned to the following day?    Okay.    As you – as the proceedings were adjourned at what stage were the discussions in terms of what you needed to do in order to say have the matter settled.  Now initially they said according to your lawyer you would have to admit to wrongdoing in regard to the report.  Did that – had that changed to something else by the time you adjourned or had that not changed as yet?    To compromise.    Okay.    Admit to wrongdoing.    Yes.    Oh they were saying.    What – what would you give – what were you prepared to give in order for there to be an agreement to settle.  They were talking along – they were trying to find out if you were not prepared to admit to wrongdoing what is it that you were prepared to admit?    ja.    Yes, yes.    You would keep your job.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Yes.    They will get rid of you.    Yes.    Take it.    Ja.    Hm.    Those were the sort of advises you were getting from people.    Yes.    Yes.  Well overnight when you came back in the morning was there something that you – had you made up your mind how you wanted to sort this out or you just wanted the discussions to continue.    Yes, yes.  Yes.    You did not want to say anything that was not true.    Yes okay.    An agreement.    Sorry let us go to the agreement.    287?    Yes okay continue talking I just wanted us to find where the agreement is for later but I want you to continue to talk – to tell me how the discussions went up to the time that the agreement was signed.    Was that – was that before you told them what you – what would be acceptable to you?  Because you must have come back and your lawyer must have said what did you think or what do you think? Are you prepared or not prepared and you must have told him something which he passed on to Mr Mokhari.    Before you came?    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    When you signed?    Ja.    Which was important to you?    Ja.    Is that the one looking like…    Oh the – he initialled there.    Oh so it was not there.    Oh which – okay.    Okay, okay.    And MB or well – or is it MS?    Oh okay.    But did not somebody initial on this part of the – on behalf of the employer?  On the first page.    Yes I see that.    Who did that, do you know?    What is her name – his name?    Oh okay.    Okay.    Yes on page 2.    Yes.  So you – you were – you went – you had some discomfort with the first page?    And you were not prepared to even initial it.    And your lawyer initialled it?    But you signed the second page?    Was that your own way of trying to protect yourself by not signing at a page that you were not comfortable with?    Ja.  You were just not comfortable.    Ja that will mean – yes yes.    You – ja, ja.  You knew that it would bind you but…    Hm.  Yes Ms Wentzel.    Well he was looking at the agreement.  Is that not the - what you want him to look at?    No, no I think it is your question.  I think he had the agreement.  You had the agreement?    Ja.    No it was your question.    I think your question – let me say this.  It would seem that the reason why you were uncomfortable with the first page is that it saying you were pleading guilty to a charge of dishonesty and defeating the ends of justice.  Is that right?    Yes.  You were uncomfortable about that?    Because your position was that you were not guilty of any dishonesty and you were not guilty of anything?    Is that right?    Hm at your level yes.    You have to go.    Yes.    Yes.    Do you want – could you just reiterate again your reasons for signing the agreement nevertheless?    Despite your discomfort, despite your position that you were saying you were not guilty of anything where – what was your – what were your reasons for signing nevertheless?    I think we should adjourn.    Ja we will adjourn and return at twenty five to twelve.  We adjourn.    Yes.  Let us continue.    I am sorry.  Do you say in the course of these proceedings?    Disciplinary proceedings.  Okay.  Ja.    Hm.    Was that on the first day of the disciplinary hearing?    Ja.    That is now before he went out to get and then your lawyer - and asked to come so that they could discuss or was it later than that?    Oh.  Then later on he asked you to sign an affidavit?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    They wanted you to say in the affidavit that Mr McBride and Mr - Mr Sesoko to do what?    To alter the report?    The first report?    Hm.  So you saw the affidavit.  You read it or did not even see it but you knew what it was saying?    Ja, but they told you what it was saying?    Yes and you refused?    Hm.    Would this have been on the first - same day that you signed the settlement agreement or would it have been a few days later?    The same day, okay.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes, yes, yes.    Did you have a copy of the agreement with you at the time or not really?    Oh, you cannot remember.    Yes, okay.    So you assured him that you had not implicated him.    Okay.    Was that in the media?    Yes, okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    And what was the affidavit saying in essence?    Hm.    Hm.    Yes, yes, yes.  Yes.  So - so it was - it was consistent with what you understood to be the true facts?    Okay.    Hm.    Hm, hm.  Yes.    Yes.    On the 28 t h?    The 29 t h?    The 29 t h would that have been a Monday - a Tuesday?    Because Monday was the 28 t h - the 28 t h I think you said.    Ja, okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    I guess especially after what you were told at the disciplinary hearing which led to the agreement.  Namely whatever you say if you continue - if the hearing continues you will be fired.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  You had reached that point?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.   This was now after you had sent your representations?    Your explanation?    Yes.    Hm.    No hearing nothing?    Hm.    After getting the letter?    What was your state of mind after getting the letter that makes you not to remember how you reached the house?    Hm.    Huh-uh, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  Which is the thing you had sought to avoid when you agreed to this settlement agreement even though you were not happy with page 1?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  You - you become more convinced that what had been told to your lawyer that you were going to be fired anyway you were going to be fired if the disciplinary hearing proceeded must have been true?    Hm.  Okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm and the letter was signed by Mr Kgamanyane?    Yes.    Did you email your - your explanation?    Yes.    Okay.  Hm.    You do not - you are not going to read the whole letter, hm?    Ja.  I think just go to what is important because     I see when I look at this letter that Mr Kgamanyane wrote to you asking you to - inviting you - you to make representations why it is - ja.  That in terms of that letter what he was seeking to do - to - is to in effect do away with the final written warning that had been agreed to as part of the settlement in respect of the charges that you - you had that been preferred against you and he was seeking to replace that with dismissal.  So he was seeking to unbundle the settlement agreement?    He - he was seeking to charge you with misconduct in regard to you deposing to an affidavit.  He was seeking you to give a penalty - a sanction for the charges that you had faced at the disciplinary inquiry.    And that is quite strange because it looks like on the one hand he was seeking to do away with the - with the settlement agreement but on the other hand he also wanted to use it because your plea of guilty was part of the settlement agreement.  If the agreement is put aside that means there is no plea of guilty.    And therefore there should be an inquiry?    And the inquiry that had been scheduled from the beginning should then proceed?    But he - he wanted to retain the part of the settlement agreement where you had pleaded guilty but to discard the part of the settlement agreement that related to a final written warning and to then put in a different - a different sanction that had - that had not been part of the settlement agreement.    I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  I may have missed this while I was focusing on this letter from Mr Kgamanyane at page 3 - the earlier letter at page 3-0-1 or is it the one ending at page 300.  I see Mr Khuba that in your representations to Mr Kgamanyane among other    Yes, but you - you made it clear here that you were quite happy to actually go through to - to resume the disciplinary process and go through a disciplinary process?    Hm.  Okay.    Well the - three is a paragraph which is I think important also on the last - second page of your letter.  Namely page      I’m sorry excuse me Miss Wentzel I think you did refer to the letter of dismissal but I actually didn’t go there, what page is it again?    I see that in the letter of dismissal he says, that is Mr Kgamanyane,  “Due to the seriousness of this transgression and the seniority position you hold in IPID as the Provincial Head, I find that I’m unable to trust you anymore an as such the trust relationship has been irreparably broken down.  The position you occupy is one of trust and the person who occupies it, must be a person with integrity.  You have demonstrated through your dishonest conduct that you lack integrity and cannot be trusted by the employer, I therefore dismiss you from your employment with immediate effect”. Does this in any way go back to a point you made earlier on with regard to why they would want to keep you as part of the settlement if you were guilty of such serious misconduct as dishonesty and defeating the ends of justice.    Yes.      Yes and – okay let me ask this question, how was your relationship with Mr Kgamanyane before this – before the disciplinary hearing?    Before he became acting Executive Director.    Yes.    He being Provincial Head in Free State?    And you being in Limpopo?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Is that so?    Did you say after eight months or so?    Now Mr Sesoko testified that when Mr Kgamanyane, I think his suspension letter if I’m not mistaken, he basically, I think asked him a question which kind of required Mr Kgamanyane to say why he was doing this because Mr Sesoko said I think the two of them also had – they had a very good relationship before Mr Kgamanyane became acting Executive Director of IPID.  He said he had even helped him, I think, when he was setting up in the Free State, setting up offices and so on and he said Mr Kgamanyane responded and I think there’s a transcript for it by saying something along the lines that when you join the police before they confirm you or confirm  your appointment and they instruct you to go and arrest your  father, you have to go and arrest your father, which Mr Sesoko understood as a way of saying, I’ve been instructed to do this.  So in other words it’s not me, I’ve been instructed to do this.  You did not have any such situation in your interactions with Mr Kgamanyane?    Yes.    Yes okay – yes okay thank you, you may continue.    This is even before they could sit down?    He was quiet?    Yes.    Mahlangu.    Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride?    So you say he was very direct that’s how he put it?    Yes.    Did they say in what way they wanted you to implicate them, to implicate Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko?    What did they say?    What did they say?    Oh yes and they were from the Hawks and at that time he was already acting head of the Hawks.    Well before – after you had, had a discussion tell us how the discussion ended?    The following day?    This was February 2016?    Oh I’m sorry October 2015?    Okay yes.    So on the second day, what did they say, I want that discussion?    They were being nice to you?    Yes and this time was it just the two of them again or was there different…[intervenes].    So they – I want the discussion between the two of you, just tell me more this time now?    Yes.    Yes.    9AM to 4PM.    You’d just sleep?    Yes.    On the phone ja.    When he was in the house.     But tell me on that conversation on the phone, just tell me in full what he said and what you said back as far as you are able to remember?    Is that how he put it?    Okay.    Yes.    Oh she was saying maybe just forget the IPID issue.    Just look for another job.    Yes.    Ja make peace with and put it behind you.    So – but the conversation on the telephone or with Colonel Mahlangu ended on the basis that he said make a statement against your enemies and you said – or something like that?    And that you will then be reinstated?    Yes okay and then what happened – oh I’m sorry Ms Wentzel you may continue, do we have that – a transcript of that telephone conversation?    Let’s go to it.    Yes page 310.    Well maybe read it yourself Miss Wentzel, I think it will be quicker.    We don’t need to read the whole thing, just the important features.    I think just say Khuba, Mahlangu so that…    Yes thank you, that transcript of course she hasn’t read everything on the transcript, that transcript of that telephone call, does it reflect substantially the conversation you had on the phone with Colonel Mahlangu?    Okay.    Maybe before we go there, did Colonel Mahlangu follow-up on the issue that the two of you discussed on the telephone at a later stage?    Yes.    Would that have been a few days after the day on which the telephone call took place?    Okay.  You called him.    Oh the – was he going to come home    Now on the – on the – on the transcript of the telephone conversation I did not pick up anything in terms of which he was going to come home.  Did he call after – afterwards to say I would like to come home or is it in the conversation?    I might not have picked it because I did not read everything.  But that is your understanding?  In the telephone conversation…    3?    310?    Oh that is     Okay so that.    He was going to talk to the Brigadier.    With a view to make an appointment for either him or them to see you on Monday.    Okay.  And then you phoned him before they could come?    And you had said to him you are not at home?    And what else did you say in that telephone conversation?    Yes.    Oh.    Okay and there was no further arrangement made?    Okay and nothing actually…    They did not pursue the issue?    Ja they did not.    Okay alright.  I think then you can continue.     I am sorry I think – I think we should say for what it is worth Ms Wentzel.  You – Mr Khuba you did in October 2015 you lodged an application in the Labour Court challenging your dismissal, is that right?    And you have attached your founding affidavit and loss of motion as Annexure HIK25?    Ms Wentzel will not go to that now but just for the sequence let us do – I wanted us to record the sequence. And then that it seems was decided in April 2017. She will deal with that later.  In the meantime then she wants to talk to you about what is in 107.  Okay.  Then you can continue Ms Wentzel.    You should not ask him to look at it unless he says he wants to refresh his memory.  You just ask him a question and then he can tell the story.    What happened in February 2016?  Did you have any meeting or visit by members of the Hawks?    Tell me more.  Tell me about that visit?  Who visited you?  Where it was?  And what was discussed.    You can refresh your memory if you want to look at the names that is fine.    Yes.    Yes did they make an appointment before or not?    You cannot remember?    Yes.  They came to your house?    Yes.    Defeating the ends of justice.    ja.    Of Colonel Mahlangu and …    Yes which you saw…    Which they – had with them.    Yes.    Defeating the ends of justice.    Yes okay.    Now the Hawks of course at that time were under General Ntlemeza?    Yes.  Your friend.    Okay.  Yes.  The one who according to Mr Mahlangu was going to re – have you reinstated if you – if you signed and – statement implicating Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko.    So what did they say to you and what did you say to them?  I want that conversation.    Yes.    Was there a purpose – was the purpose of their visit to give you those questions or was the purpose to serve you with a charge sheet or summons or what was their purpose?  The purpose of their visit?    They did not say what the purpose was?    Ja.    Oh they wanted to get a warning statement from you?    Okay.    Okay    Yes.    Hm in your statement?    Colonel Mahlangu.    Oh.    Yes.    Dramat.    Yes.    You had not shared them with Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes otherwise were these people from Gauteng or were they Limpopo people?    Okay, okay.    Just before you get there.  If you have got those letters please give them – copies to the legal team where you were writing to the head office of IPID asking them to pay your claim and they were not doing that.    Ja okay continue.    Who was that now?    Your attorney or?    Oh Brigadier Xaba ja.    Oh he read it while you were there.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    He was not happy with your statement.    Yes.    Hm.    Okay.    You did not say 251?    351.    The warning statement.    Yes.    Was that on the 16 March 2016?    Yes.    At this stage when you were being – when you were arrested your case in the Labour Court was still pending?  It had not been dealt with – decided yet?    Yes, yes.      Yes.    If in terms of the sequence of events     It happened later that is fine but otherwise if it is not going to disorganise your plan you can deal with the arrest and then deal with – with that.  Which one is – would it make – enable you to tell your story better?    Later.    Now Okay.    Yes okay.    Okay deal with the labour issue.    To – yes.    The setting aside of the settlement agreement.    Oh your application to the Labour Court was an urgent application.    Yes okay.    Yes.  And who was the – was that the one who helped you with the letters or was that somebody else?    Mr Mathibe okay.    A dismissal.    Yes.    Yes.    But the bill.    Ja.  You said we will see it later.    Ja.    Ja.    On the merits.    The – ja the dispute about the dismissal.    Was referred to the bargaining council.    Ja.    Yes.    That is the employer’s representative?    Ja  yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That case may have been the case of BMW in the Labour Appeal Court a number of years ago?    That I happen to know.    Yes continue.    And it came through?    What was the finding?    Hm.    Valid and fair or something like that or fair and equitable.    Ja.    To arbitrate.    Just to earn a living in the meantime.    Hm.    Yes and then did you then launch a review application in the Labour Court or what happened?    Yes.  To set aside that – that aware and to – to try and get reinstated?    Yes.  And then there was a review application in the Labour Court?    17.    Ja.  I think there is a reference to 2017.  Ja.    And - and what was the out - the order that was made there?    Hm.    Yes.    Yes.    And you - you were reinstated?    Unfair?    Ja.    A lot of money?    Your back pay?    Oh.  You - you - oh.  Oh.  You - you thought- you thought they should have been given more time?    Was the job?    Ja, you …    As long as you got your job back?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    And but that time the - the Executive Director was back?    Mr McBride?    So basically it was his decision now?    Yes, okay.    Okay.    Yes.    Were you paid ultimately for the whole time that you had not been working?    All the benefits, ja.    Okay, thank you.  I am sure you were very happy and the family was very happy.    Hm.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    I understand this yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes.    It is a difficulty.  Yes.    And in any event whatever pain you went through just because later on you get an order reinstating you in your job does not mean you did not go through that pain.    You still went through that pain.  The job comes later and the back pay but you - you and the family went through the - that pain.    Hm, thank you.  I think Ms Wentzel we are close to finishing with him.    Let us finish before and then we take the lunch break.    Is the arbitration award and the Labour Court judgment …    Are they both here?    Ja.    Ja, put them in so that we have a complete picture.    We go back to pain and suffering.    Page - paragraph 1-1-1.    (Intervenes).    Hm.    Yes, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Exactly.    I mean were you prisoners already?    In the gallows?    Yes.    I am sorry.  What report is that?    Oh, but have you finished on the arrested and prosecution?    Issue?    Ja.    I think finish on the …    On the prosecution.    This was the prosecutor saying this to you?    So effectively saying the state has no case?    Hm.    Hm.    Did you ever understand who those witnesses were supposed to be or - or were that they were talking about?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm, hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.  So you - you - other than that person were you ever told who else was - was understood by the state to be state witnesses?    Yes.    Hm.    He was refusing to testify?    Yes.    Recommend that you be charged.    Yes.  That was strange indeed.    So it was like he was not prepared to stand in court and - and show why his conclusions were - were justified?    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.      Yes.    Hm.  Yes and then - and then the charges were withdrawn?    Ja, okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    The charge - disciplinary?    Ja, okay.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Hm.    Well I want - I am sorry.  I wanted to ask Ms Wentzel why - why must I hear about the Public Protector’s Report that was issued recently?    Hm.    But - but have you - has the Commission investigated that in relation to the conduct of the Public Protector?    Yes.  No.  What I am asking is if they say the Public Protector is doing this - what the Public Protector is doing is part of the fight back.  Has that being …    Tested by the Commission?  Was that being investigated?    Yes.  Why do we not wait until …    That has happened?    Ja, because it is not in the statement.    It is a recent thing.    If - if they say it is part of whether you call it fight back or whatever you need to get statements from them.  Hear what the substantiation is.  How they substantiate that and then if necessary then we - we can - can come back …    But I do not think we should …    Deal with it …    Before there is proper investigation.    Ja.  You understand that - you understand that Mr Khuba?    That what I am - what I am saying is and - and it is just that I - I - when Mr Sesoko gave evidence I think it was dealt with very superficially.  What I am saying is it may be that it is something that should be add here but it should not be add before the investigators of the Commission and the legal team take statements and look at it properly.  You understand that?    Yes, it can …    Yes.  Ja that is right.    So because otherwise we are dealing with something that has not been properly investigated …    And it should not be like that.    Ja.  Okay.    Yes.    Okay.  Thank you very much Mr Khuba for coming to give evidence and to share with the Commission your experiences and what you know.  You probably will come back because there is still some further - an affidavit that you are going to put together and so arrangements will be made in due course for you to come back so that you can deal with the Werksmans Report but be in touch with the legal team. If at all possible depending on your situation I think I would like - I would be glad if the preparation of that affidavit can happen without delay.  I do not know what - what the chances are that by end of this - of this coming week it could be done but if not at least it should not delay for more than two weeks. I would like to - those affidavits to be available.  Your one, Mr McBride’s one and Mr Sesoko’s one and the legal team must be in touch with them but I know you would share the information with them as well.  Am I right Mr Khuba?    Yes.  Ja and then we will take it from there but otherwise thank you very much for - for coming to give evidence but for now you are excused.    Thank you.  We are going to take the lunch adjournment now.  The time is 26 passed.  We will - pass one - we will resume at 20 - we will resume at half past two.      And when we resume we will then start with the evidence of Colonel Naidoo.    We adjourn.    Are you ready Ms Wentzel?    Yes we are now going to hear the evidence of Colonel Naidoo to whom Colonel Roelofse referred in his evidence. In accordance with the order that I made yesterday he is not present here in this hearing room but he was – he will be heard here and when he is asked questions he will hear the questions and be able to give an answer.  He has already been sworn so the oath has been administered to him but when we start I will just get him to confirm that the oath has been administered to him, but before we get there Ms Wentzel is there anything you want to say before we start?    Do you not want to explain how he will deal with the question of identities of some of the implicated persons so that everybody knows so that when you get to that stage people don’t wonder what is happening.    I think just say it for the public and then you can repeat it with him later.    Of course you will make further efforts to obtain clarity on the persons who were agents or informers or are still agents and informers among the people that he implicates or the group in respect of which you were requested, you previously requested clarity because it was not clear exactly who falls under what, so it may well be, or what is contemplated is that once clarity is obtained then certain names would be or could be revealed if those people were not or are not agents or informers and in which case if during Colonel Naidoo’s evidence he has referred to them as FN1 or FN2 or FN3 it would be indicated what acronym or number was used for that person in due course but to try and not compromise the identity of people who might be involved in sensitive intelligence work we will use the numbers.  Will they all start with FN?    FN and then a number?    Yes, okay alright, no that’s fine then.    Yes, are we now connected, Colonel Naidoo can you hear me?    You can.  Good afternoon to you.    Thank you very much for availing yourself to give evidence in proceedings of this Commission.   We appreciate it very much that you have availed yourself.   Various measures have been taken in accordance with an order that I issued to try and ensure that your situation is protected as somebody who is in the witness protection program, but before we start I just want you to confirm that you are the Colonel Naidoo who was referred to by Colonel Roelofse in his evidence before the Commission.    Okay thank you.   Do you confirm that you have taken an oath to speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth when you are giving evidence in the Commission?    And that you have indicated that you consider the oath binding on your conscience?    Okay thank you very much.   Ms Wentzel will then ask you questions to lead your evidence.  Ms Wentzel?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    What happened to ...[intervenes]     Oh there was a break-in?    Was that did you say it was at the house of a relative of yours?    A close     Oh but you say you – it could be just normal criminality or it could be connected with attempts to intimidate you?    Yes, yes.  Okay thank you very much.   Has the matter been reported to the relevant authorities already or not?    Yes.    Yes, okay, Ms Wentzel just make sure that you get in touch with the Hawks or somebody in the legal team, get in touch with the Hawks so that they can look into the matter urgently.    Okay that will be done Colonel Naidoo.    Okay thank you.  Let me take this opportunity to check that everybody in the room can hear everybody?   Okay, thank you, alright, let’s continue.    That is a lever arch file hey?    Have you got a lever arch file Colonel Naidoo that is marked on the spine Exhibit KK1.2 and Exhibit KK1.1?    Okay    The lever arch file containing – you see I think where you have a supplementary affidavit there was no need to give it a separate exhibit number because that causes confusion.    Because all the lever arch files you just have one, so once you say inside the same lever arch file there is exhibit – there are Exhibit KK1.1 and Exhibit KK1.2 it causes confusion especially because they can all go into one file, but we now have to be careful if you are not going to – is the numbering in terms of the red numbers, sequential from page 1 up to the end or does it change somewhere and start from one again?    Because if that is so we can actually delete any reference to Exhibit KK1.2 and simply say the lever arch file and its contents are Exhibit KK1.1 and it starts from page 1 up to whatever and as long as you bear in mind where the supplementary affidavit is that should be enough, is that fine?    Yes, okay, alright.  So the lever arch file containing the statement of Dhanajaya Gangulu Naidoo will be marked as Exhibit KK1.1.  So what will remain is that we just change this so that is no reference to KK1.2.    Okay, alright, so Colonel Naidoo if we talk about Exhibit KK1.1 it will be the lever arch file in front of you and its contents.    Thank you.    So there is an affidavit which has got everything.    Because the one I have in front of me doesn’t have that as well.    Okay, alright.  Yes continue    Ja if you can start with them.    Yes, no that is fine, you can start with them.    Yes.    Mmm.    Yes I’m sorry Colonel Naidoo just remind me again you did give the timeframe from when to when what period are we talking about in 2011 when these incidents happened?   I just want to be reminded of that.    Okay, yes.    Or do you want to, is there anything you want to tell me about the content of the discussions on that hour long interview more or less?    Yes.    Oh, how you operate?    Yes.    Okay, okay, yes?    Yes?    At that stage had they officially asked you if you could tell them certain information or not yet, they were just having discussions with you without necessarily asking you to give them sensitive information?    The secret service account, the looting of the secret service account.    Yes, so this would have been on the 19 t h of October 11.    Yes, okay.  So that was Colonel Roelofse and Henkel, did you say Colonel Henkel?    Piet Viljoen?    Yes, okay, continue.    Yes.    Your dates, okay, yes.    The 18 t h of October, that interview on the 18 t h of October is that the one that you said was about an hour long?    Oh that was in September.    But the 18 t h October one was the second interview with them.    With Colonel Roelofse.    And whoever he was with.    Okay, alright, yes.   So you say after the interview of the 18 t h of October 2011 General Lazarus spoke to you.    Yes, continue.    Yes.    Yes.    I am sorry may I just interrupt you.    Just to get certain things straight.  The first interview with the Hawks – your first interview with the Hawks was sometime in September 2011. That is the interview which you say related to administrative issues, is that right?    Yes. And then the second interview is the one that happened on the 18 October 2011, is that right?    Yes.  Now is that the one where you say you had decided to tell them many of the things that you knew which were – which related to corruption and looting of the Secret Service Account?    Or is that on the 19 t h?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes okay but – but with regard to the 18 t h – so with regard to the 18 t h you were simply answering questions that …    That they were putting to you.    And that is the – that is the day where in respect of which you say you were not sure whether you could trust them or not at that stage?    So you knew you had knowledge of a lot of things that were happening but you were not sure whether you could trust them.  But insofar as the questions that they put to you you say you answered those questions honestly?    And you say that interview took the whole day?    On the 18 t h?    And then after the Hawks were gone General Lazarus called you and asked you about their visit to you?    Ja.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Oh he knew that you were going to be having an interview with the Hawks?    Okay.    Yes that is General Lazarus?    Do you want to just you know remind us what position General Lazarus held at Crime Intelligence at the time?    Yes.  And who was the head of the Crime Intelligence at the time?    Well if he was suspended it means he was – he was Head of the Crime Intelligence.    But there would have been somebody acting in his – in the position?    So he – so General Mdluli was the Head of Crime Intelligence but he was on suspension?    You cannot remember who was acting in his position?    Okay.  And General Lazarus would he have been like number 2 in Crime Intelligence or not?    In terms of the hierarchy in Crime Intelligence?    Yes.    Quite close to – his position was it like one grade below that of General Mdluli or is that something you do not know?    Yes.    Oh okay alright.  Okay if you may then continue with your – to tell us about the discussion that you were having with General Lazarus.  You said he was upset when…    Yes.    Hm    Hm.    How did he show his – I think you said earlier he was furious and then later you said he was upset.  How did he show it?    Ja.    Okay.  Okay.    Oh the manner in which he spoke to you after you told him what you had told the Hawks?    Okay continue.    Yes.    All of the things you knew relating to corruption and crime and the looting of the Secret Service Account?    Okay.  Okay.  Did you have an arrangement to meet with Colonel Roelofse on the 19 t h or there was no arrangement as such you – but once you made this decision you were going to contact him?    Oh okay.  Yes and what happened on the 10 t h then?    Oh okay.    Okay I am sorry I am interrupting you again Colonel Naidoo.  Let us deal first with your interview with the Hawks on the 19 t h October before we go to your meeting or discussion with General Lazarus after the interview.    What happened at the interview – at your interview with the Hawks on the 19 t h October?  Did you tell them everything that you knew?    Oh yes.    Hm.    Yes.  Okay no that is fine.    Yes I think Ms Wentzel then can take it from there.    Sorry Ms Wentzel.  Let us finish first what he touched on earlier on and I stopped him.  He said after his interview with the Hawks on the 19 t h he had a discussion with General Lazarus.    But I stopped him before he could tell us exactly what transpired.    In that discussion.  Let us hear about that part?    The – was there an arrangement between the two of you namely yourself and General Lazarus that after the interview – your interview with the Hawks on the 19 t h you should come back to him and tell him what you discussed with them?    Yes so you – you went – you went to tell him on your own not because he had asked you to come and tell him?    Yes.    Yes.  And you say you gave him what you call a watered version – a watered down version of what you had disclosed to the Hawks, is that right?    Yes.    What was your motivation for giving him a watered down version of what you had disclosed to the Hawks?    Yes.    Yes.  And he was one of the people who were implicated in what you had disclosed to the Hawks?    Yes.  Okay.  So how did that meeting end – that discussion between the two of you?    It just accepted…    Accepted what you said and that is – it ended there?    You cannot remember.  Yes.    Okay.  Alright.  Ms Wentzel you can proceed.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Just repeat that please?  You told him that you had told the Hawks that you had put in false claims to the value of R100 000.00.    Okay alright.  Continue.    Just have a look at the list that you have.  If it is somebody who is supposed to be referred to by way FM and a number just mention the number.  The FM and the number.  But I take it Ms Wentzel that anybody that is not mentioned here that is not in the list and that he does not know to be an agent or informer he could mention but those are people in the statement.    Yes.  Yes Colonel Naidoo do you understand that?    Yes okay.    So if the person that you were wondering whether you can mention you would have to look if you find then you mention FM and the number.  But if it looks like it takes you some time we can see what to do but it is not a list that is terribly long.  It is one page I think.  It is one page.  Okay do you want to check there or is the name not there?    Oh okay.    FM40?    40?    Okay.    Yes.    Hm.    That is now the two of them?    Ja.    Now do you think what was shocking them was that you had disclosed that to the Hawks or what was shocking them was that you had put in claims for that kind of amount?    Oh it was more the amount.    Oh the admissions okay.    Okay.  Alright.    Okay.    This is still on the 19 t h October 2011?    Oh on the 20 t h October yes okay.    Yes.    So the interview of the 20 t h also was like a daylong interview?  Took more or less the whole day?    The interview of the 20 t h October – oh I am sorry – ja the interview of the 19 t h October did it last the whole day?    More or less?    Okay no that is fine.  So the two of them were concerned and asked – and suggested that you go and rest?    And this is on the 20 t h now?    Yes and then what happened?    And this was around what time of the day?    Okay.  Yes continue.    Colonel FM08 yes.    You are looking for the other one.    Number – ja no that is fine just have a look.  It was FM08 Chair    Yes.    Oh FM08 and FM09?    Yes okay.    Yes.    When you saw them for the first time were they in a car or were they walking?    Oh.    Yes.  So when you saw the car and you saw one of them I think you said climbing over the fence.  Was it when you, your wife and your son were coming back home from the walk?    Oh okay.    And the car was outside the gate?    In front of the gate.    Yes.  And you say one of them was jumping over the fence?    Oh he was coming from inside the premises?    Okay.  Yes continue.    Who had you left at home?  Was there – were there children that you had left at home or anybody?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    That is – who was saying that to you now?    Yes okay.    Yes.    Did you not ask why at that stage?    You did not.    Yes.  And – yes.  This was after hours hey?    Yes.  So your – your wife and your son proceeded to walk home.     And you jumped into this car?    Yes.  Continue.,    And who was driving do you remember whether it was FM08 or FM09?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    To remember.    No that is fine.    Yes okay.    Yes.  In the meantime Ms Wentzel I just see that some of the copies here are very bad.    So please make arrangements I always say to the legal team in advance of bundles coming to me once you have identified that they are copies that are not legible or that really are just too of poor quality arrangements should be made if at all possible so that we have copies that are legible.    So you can try for maybe – so that next week we have better pages.    Yes.    Yes, okay.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Marimuthu?    Okay.    So he - I am sorry.  So General Lazarus said he had spoken to a certain pastor.    Pastor Jonathan …    And he said everything will be over soon?    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  So did it - did it appear like to you he accepted that you might not have told Colonel Barnard that you had put in a false - false claims amounting to R100 000,00?    Yes.    Okay, yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    08 and FM09.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    You proceeded to …?    To the braai area in General Lazarus’ house?    Okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Now - okay.  Who was giving the instruction that the evidence of air tickets should be destroyed?    Yes.    Yes.    Ja.    Yes.  Huh-uh.    Yes.  You did mention FM09.    Yes.    Do you want to spell Mahesh?    Is it …?    Okay.  Thank you.    Yes.    Hm.    Huh-uh.    The records?    Okay; and how did this gathering at the braai area of General Lazarus’ house end?    Yes.    Hm.    Ja.    Huh-uh.    Yes.    Yes.    Hm.    Yes, okay.  I think I would like us to stop there for the day and then when we resume on Monday you can then take us from there where there was the suggestion that you go for drinks.  Is that alright?    Yes.  Okay.  We are going to adjourn at this stage then and tomorrow - I mean on Monday not tomorrow.  On Monday we will start at 10 as usual.  Thank you very much Colonel Naidoo.  Arrangements will be made for you to be also available on Monday for us to continue.    Okay.  We adjourn. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Good morning Chair.    Mr Khuba you were testifying yesterday that you briefed Mr McBride on the Rendition case and he then instructed you to go and collect the docket which you did.  Could you then tell the Chair how it came about that what is now known as the second report was prepared?    No.    I know that is a very nice promotion.  I will tell the bar council.      Yes Chair.  Could you explain to the Chair how it came about that you compiled the second report together with Sibiya?  I mean Sesoko – Sesoko.  I beg your pardon.    And is that the report that appears in the bundle at page 139?    Now the final recommendation in that report is    Thank you.    The – if you have regard to page 176 of the    And this report was signed both by you, Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride, is that correct?    And what was Mr McBride’s involvement in the compilation of the report?    Now if you go to page 25 of your statement at    I do not know.  I always call them Worksmans but other people call them Werksmans.    And Mr Khuba just to clarify the report that you sent to Mr Sesoko was that what we are now calling the amended report    So it was not the first report it was the amended report?    Thank you Chair.  Now if you go now please deal with the telephone conversation – the telephone call you received from the Minister’s personal assistant dealt with in paragraph 81 of your statement, page 25?    Mr Khuba after Mr McBride was suspended who replaced him?    And …    Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba you say in paragraph 83 on page 26 of your statement that hereafter you went to Duma Nokwe Chambers in Sandton and met with Advocate William Mokhari SC.  Could you explain what happened at that meeting?  Firstly who told you to go and what happened?    Now tell me…    Did you hereafter attend further interviews with Werksmans or Worksmans?    Yes.    We will make a note of that.    Now after the interviews Werksmans produced a report which appears at the bundle page 178.    Yes.    Chair, I was going to deal with it with the witness because …    There is a great deal of what is said …    In the report is based upon what they say they were told by Mr Khuba.    There is also part of these papers a confirmatory affidavit that Mr Khuba deposed to in support of McBride …    In his disciplinary proceedings.    In that …    Affidavit …    He deals with     Comprehensively all the things …    The - the grounds upon which Werksmans say they came to their final conclusion that the report had been altered.    And …    Because of that I think that perhaps …    He is in a position to …    To deal with it.    I - I have got no difficulty with that …    That approach whatsoever.    The only thing Chair is …    There are one or two aspects in the report …    That I would like to draw to your attention …    And also to the attention of the witness …    Which do not deal specifically with the allegations …    Against him or things that they say he said.    Hm.    So if we could have regard to page - the report Chair starts at page 178.    78.    And then if you can go to page 182 of the    The other aspect …    Chair the second aspect I wanted to deal with is what you testified to yesterday.  You were explaining what the purpose and role was of an IPID Report and what the - what you understood the role was of the NPA once they received the report …    And just by that I would like you to comment on this.  If we can have regard to page 196.    196.  In paragraph 3.1.2 it says what you have stated. “The first report was compiled by Khuba with the assistance of Moukangwe and the guidance of Mosing and Moletsi.  In the section we elucidate the circumstances under which this report was produced by Khuba and Moukangwe. Our explanation of the circumstances under which this report was produced is based on the interviews conducted with Khuba, Moukangwe and Mosing.”        Mr Khuba if you could then have a look at page 200 paragraph 3.1.21.    This is another issue that you - you dealt with …    Extensively yesterday.    200.    3.1.21.    It says here   It is …    But it is only that he was debating yesterday.  He said he was party to drafting the IPID statute and he said in terms of that statute they are not required by law to take the recommendations that IPID sends them.  That - if you remember he said there was this distinction …    I actually did not get a chance as yet because I have been trying to do that.    I will.    Yes.    Yes.    Chair.    Yes.  It was only with regard to the …    Cellphone records …    But I will deal with that …    When he testifies again.    Hm.    Not quite yet.    But …    No.  I - I just need a few issues.    I am not going in a lot of detail.    Thank you.  We know that Werksmans recommended that you, McBride and Sesoko be criminally charged for defeating the ends of justice or obstructing the administration of justice and that disciplinary charges be brought against you in your capacity as employees. Now you will deal with the report and you will deal with that recommendation.  If you can go now to paragraph 87 on page 27 of your report …    Of - of his affidavit.  I am sorry.    27 Chair.    There it is said that   Could you then deal with your suspension which you start to deal with from paragraph 88 of your report?      If you have regard to page 25…[intervenes].    It’s about exactly what he’s testifying now, I want to show him the transcript of this conversation.      If you could have regard to page 253.    Yes, now this is not a certified transcript, you’ve said you recorded this, when was this transcribed?      And did you personally transcribe it?    Okay it’s also confirmed in an affidavit by Miss Nitsiyanda but if we can just have a look at what is said at line - well let’s start at the beginning, she says, “Yes Mr Khuba, how are you, I’m fine okay I’ve been asked [inaudible] where are you, I must come and serve you with a letter.  Okay I’m in Polokwane.  You are in Polokwane? Yes. Because apparently the Minister said that you must have the letter today and I am still in the office which means I must drive right now, will you wait for me and then I will call you when I am closer so that we can meet somewhere.  Yes, yes.  Okay no thank you so much for your understanding.  Okay thank, sure yes”, And then if we have regard to an affidavit that was deposed to…[intervenes].      Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba if you can then look at a confirmatory affidavit that was deposed to in the disciplinary proceedings in the matter between IPID and Mr Sesoko on page 257 and at page 258 paragraph three, she says, “I confirm in addition that upon receiving instructions from – sorry I hereby confirm same insofar as they relate to me regarding circumstances around the handling of a letter to Mr Khuba.  I confirm in addition that upon receiving instructions from the current acting Executive Director Mr Kgamanyane, he specifically told me, in no uncertain terms that the aforesaid letter must be delivered to Mr Khuba that same day and that those were the specific instructions of the Minister  at IPID when we refer to the term Minister, it is the Minister  of Police that we duly – that we normally refer to.  I duly  complied with the instruction and called Mr Khuba to arrange  for delivery of the letter as properly articulated in the  Annexure to Mr Sesoko’s affidavit marked NS6”.    Now is it correct…[intervenes].      Oh yes.    I don’t think we probably need anything further.      Yes.    Thank you Chair.  After you received your notice of suspension did you, thereafter participate in a disciplinary hearing?      Yes we have.     The letter of suspension is Annexure HIK15, if you just bear with me I don’t seem to have put a reference it will be 250 something.  It’s page 382, Mr Khuba is that your letter of suspension?      If you have a look at the…[intervenes].    I don’t believe so but I will verify.      Yes.    No Chair I don’t remember seeing it myself.      Thank you Chair.   In paragraph 91 page 28 of your statement, you say that on the 19 t h of June 2015 you deposed to a supporting affidavit in the High Court in the matter between Mr McBride and the Minister of Police, could you have regard to page 260 and confirm whether this is the supporting affidavit that you referred to?    And Chair it is also in this supporting affidavit that certain issues and aspects in – with regard to the Werksmans report are dealt with but that we will canvas at a later stage.      Then on the 7 t h of July 2015 you were served with a notice to attend a disciplinary enquiry and that appears at page 284, is that correct, is that the notice?    Could you please tell the Chair what happened at that disciplinary inquiry?      Thank you.  Now just for the record Advocate Makwari was the same Advocate who you say, a month or two prior to this had asked you to depose to a confirmatory affidavit in favour of the Minister.    And that was in proceedings against Mr McBride?      Now do you remember when the disciplinary proceedings were ultimately held?    The agreement is at page 287 Chair.    Yes.    Now if we have regard to that letter that you signed and I think it is important that – that we see what was actually said so that we can understand why you felt so uncomfortable.  It says under the introduction  “The first employee Innocent Khuba was charged with dishonesty and defeating the ends of justice as more fully set out in the charge sheet attached hereto marked A.  Pursuant to the institution of disciplinary action against Mr Khuba the parties have reached agreement on the 23 r d September 2015.  The parties wished to record in writing the terms of the agreement which terms they record below.  Under the    Then it says   Oh sure.  Do you want to have a look at page 288    Yes but he seemed to not – I noticed him paging…    Oh.    Yes oh okay.    Chair would this be an appropriate time.    Yes if we could?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba were you during the course of these disciplinary proceedings asked to sign an affidavit?    Disciplinary proceedings.    Did they want you to say anything about Mr McBride or Mr Sesoko in that affidavit?    Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba after signing the settlement agreement did you go and see Mr Sesoko?    Can you just explain what happened?    Could you have regard to page 2-9-2?  Is that the confirmatory affidavit that you gave to Mr Sesoko?    And if you can have a look at page 2-9-5    And then at page 2-9-6 paragraphs 20 and 21    Now did your employer know that you had deposed to this affidavit?    Mr Khuba who hand delivered this letter of dismissal to you?    So did somebody from Head Office in Pretoria again have to drive to Limpopo to hand deliver this letter to you?    And if you can look at the timing between sending your representations in response to the letter you have received on 29 September 2015. Is it possible that those representations could have been considered before leaving Pretoria with this letter?    Now please will you have regard to the document at page 298.  It is a document addressed to you by Mr Kgamanyane dated 29 September 2015.  Is that the notice of dismissal essentially?    That was sent to you?    And if we have regard to paragraph 3 it says   No.    “…without my knowledge or consent deposed to an affidavit in Polokwane which contradicted the terms of your guilty plea as contained in the settlement agree.”    And that refers to you saying that there was no condition in the agreement that you could not depose to the affidavit and you regard the agreement as being invalid and you are going to go to court if need be to set it aside.    Then the next document on page 3-0-5 dated 30 September 2015 is that the letter of your summary dismissal?    Thank you.  Mr Khuba I am now dealing with paragraph 103 on page 31 of your statement.    103 page 31.    Please could tell the Chair what happened on 3 October 2015 which was three days after your dismissal?    And if - if you can perhaps have regard also to page 3-0-2.  Sorry.  I can see you already closed it.    And then one, two, three - the - the last    Thank you Chair.  Okay now Mr Sesoko can you tell the Chair what happened on the 3 r d of October 2015 three days after your dismissal, where you deal with it in paragraph 103 of your statement.    It’s page 305 Chair.      Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba could you please now tell the Chair what happened on the 3 r d of October it’s dealt with at paragraph 103 of your statement?    Yes.      The transcript is Annexure 24 and it starts at page 308, the actual wording at 310.  Now…[intervenes]    So you’ll see, I don’t know you would like to read it or are you happy for me to read it Mr Khuba?      That’s fine he says…[intervenes].    He says, “No I’m not at home down at the bottom paragraph 20, yet but I’m at a elder’s house, where – okay, okay.  In the rural areas here I am home, no one stays here so I decided to come and open the windows for some fresh air.  Oh that’s good yes.  Then he says, you say no man thanks I will talk to Brigadier maybe tomorrow to finalise the appointment on Monday.  Yes…[intervenes}.      I apologise yes, “Khuba, no man thanks I will talk to Brigadier maybe tomorrow to finalise the appointment on Monday. Colonel Mahlangu, yes, yes I forgot to show you something, then Khuba, okay, Colonel Mahlangu, yes I forgot to show you something just so that you know that everything that you do for good for yourself.  Khuba, okay.  Mahlangu, General, General remember General is your friend.  Khuba, Yes.  Mahlangu remember General Ntlemeza is your friend.  Khuba, yes I know he is my friend.  Colonel Mahlangu, you must  understand that whatever you do well for yourself.  Khuba, yes.  Colonel Mahlangu, not to support your enemies.  Khuba yes.  Mahlangu, we will make him we will make him and we will empower him to ensure that you restore your job that is what you must do.  Khuba, okay.  Mahlangu, that you must know whatever everything of good you do for yourself.  Khuba, okay.  Mahlangu, and you are not in line with your enemy.  Khuba, yes, yes yes.  Mahlangu, as soon as everything is finalised General is the one who will do good for you.  Khuba, okay okay.  Mahlangu, as a friend, as a person you know.  Khuba, yes.  Mahlangu, I do not think he will dump you, I do not think he will throw you in the mud the only thing you must do is be honest to yourself, fix everything, do not take wrong ideas and advices and then we will tell General the NPA will deal with whatever they deal with but we will inform General that since this guy has pushed for us to reach where we are.  Khuba, yes.  Mahlangu, as a witness.  Khuba, yes.  Mahlangu, then he is acquitted.  Khuba, okay.  Mahlangu, and something has to be done, he has to be restored next to his position or to his [indistinct].  Khuba, okay.  Mahlangu, yes please you must underline it, you must put NB behind it and underline it do not do it.  Khuba, Okay and then the response, do not highlight it with a highlighter you must write it with a red pen underneath it is the best statement to you, you must empower yourself”.    Mr Khuba if we can then go to paragraph 107 on page 32 of your statement an if you could please the Chair what happened on Wednesday the 24 t h of February 2016?    It is on page 3 – well it starts – you can look at page 310 onwards.    310.    Ja.    So just so we can get the timeline.  This first visit that you had from Colonel Moukangwe was the 3 r d October 2015.    Then I am not going to deal with the – the Labour Court application yet.  Then the following year on Wednesday the 24 t h February 2016 is it correct that you were again visited by members of the Hawks?  If you have a look at paragraph 107 of your statement page 32.    Please could you tell the Chair what happened?    Thank you Chair.  So if you can have a look at paragraph 107 of your statement.    Yes.  No I intended him to do that I just wanted him to understand where – you know what it is what – just for the dates.    If you have a look at page 351 of the bundle it is Annexure 27.    351.    Is this the statement that you are referring to where you said you are now going to set the truth out?    The warning statement?    And as you testified you set out everything that had occurred and it was only in the last part of the statement from page 361 that you say you will respond to the remaining questions.    Do you know what it was in the statement that the General had problem with or the Brigadier had a problem with?    And is it correct that this statement is substantially in line with what you have testified here today?    Mr Khuba were you later arrested?    And please could you tell …    Please could you tell the Chair the circumstances of your arrest?    Yes Chair.    Yes.  No.  We - we are virtually finished.    Hm.    No, but I will make them available.    Chair.    Thank you.  We will.  I am afraid now that we have dealt with the - a happy result can we go back and remember your arrest.    The 16 t h of what?    Ja.        Just one final question.  Mr Sesoko testified that recently there has been a Public Protector’s Report implicating him.    Are you also implicated in that report?    You remember Mr Sesoko testified that there is a recent report by the Public Protector.  It had come out I think in the - the last week - in the week that he was testifying or in the previous week.    Hm.    No Chair.    Your right.  Sorry.    On the …    What ultimately happened to your - your criminal case?    Just finally if you could deal with the recent Public Protector’s Report.    Because if you remember Mr Sesoko’s testimony.    It is his view that this is still part of a fight back.    Well not in relation to the conduct of the Public Protector but only from their perspective that …    It is being …    It is being investigated.  Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  No.  We will not deal with it.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes that is - that is about it.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.  I understand.    Yes.  I understand that Chair.    Chair I do not have any …    Further questions for the witness.    Thank you Chair.    Yes Chair.     Yes I am.     No, not at this stage.     Yes Chair I was going to deal with it with Colonel Naidoo so that he could also understand why we’re doing what we’re doing but I can just as well ...[intervenes]      Yes in Colonel Naidoo’s statement because he was involved in Crime Intelligence a good number of the people referred to in his statement either are or were or may have been agents of Crime Intelligence, or also informers.   Because of this a letter was addressed to Crime Intelligence asking them to state who are the actual agents involved in covert operations because it was Colonel Naidoo’s view that the vast majority of people who were placed into the agent program were placed into that program as a result of nepotism. However General Jacobs of Crime Intelligence has responded to the request but in view of the fact that the – it is not a 100% clear from the response as to who in fact are agents or whose safety may be compromised should their identity be revealed.  As a matter of caution we have taken a decision that we will nevertheless redact the names of all the people who could possibly be an agent and we will only refer to them by reference to a number, which will be FN1, FN2, FN3 etcetera. DCJ we have provided you with those names in a sealed envelope which – so that for our purposes you will know the names but during the course of the testimony these people will only be referred to by number.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.     Thank you Chair.     Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo what are your full names?     And is it correct that you were approached by investigators from the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture and requested to give evidence in these hearings?     And that the request resulted from certain disclosures that you made to Colonel Roelofse from the Hawks during criminal investigations undertaken by him into certain fraudulent activities involving the Secret Services account at Crime Intelligence?     Do you understand that in testifying at this Commission you may potentially incriminate yourself?     And this evidence is given freely and voluntarily?     Colonel Naidoo have you been offered a Section 204 indemnity to testify in any of the criminal cases to be prosecuted by Colonel Roelofse and the State Prosecuting Authority in any of the criminal matters that you have described in your affidavit?     And can you tell the Chair whether this offer was made to you before you informed Colonel Roelofse of the nature of the fraud and corruption perpetrated by members at Crime Intelligence or after this?     Could you just briefly at this stage detail the circumstances, if you could just detail those events, how that happened?     Yes Chair I will do that.     Colonel Naidoo I am assuming that you have a bundle in front of you that is marked Exhibit KK1.1 and KK1.2.     Yes.     And Colonel Naidoo if you have a look at the numbers on the top right hand side you will see your initials DGN and then it says in red 001.  Those are the page numbers, so when I refer you to a page it will be 1, 2, I am not going to say DGM-001, I will just say one, two, three or whatever, do you understand that?     And the document that the bundle that is in front of you is this the affidavit that you have given to the Commission which appears from pages 1 to 70?     And is it correct that you have also deposed to an affidavit which is Exhibit KK1.2 and that is a supplementary affidavit to support your application in camera and that appears at pages 141 to 153, is that correct?     Chair if I might place exhibits into evidence, marked KK1.1 and KK1.2.     It causes confusion.     No it is sequential.     Yes, that is perfectly fine, thank you Chair.     Yes.     Chair if I might just mention one thing to you before we start leading the evidence, is at page 70 you will notice that the place and identity of the Commissioner has been redacted, Chair you will have a complete version but this was done in order to conceal the place where the affidavit was attested to.     Yes.     I understood it and I apologise Chair, I will make sure that you will have the one that has everything.     Colonel Naidoo could you explain the sequence of events from when you first consulted Colonel Roelofse and when you first requested Section 204 immunity from prosecution?    Thank you.  By the stage that you depose to this “Blanket Affidavit” on the 25 t h October 2011 had you been placed into the witness protection program?    You said you deposed to an affidavit on the 25 t h October 2011 which you call your “Blanket Affidavit” which confirmed what you had told Colonel Roelofse on the 18 t h and the 19 t h October, is that correct?    Yes Chair.    Yes.    Yes.  Colonel Naidoo did you hear the Chair?  Could you explain what happened on the 19 t h October 2011 after your interview with the Hawks?    Now you said that before you gave this “Blanket Statement/Affidavit” to the Hawks on the 25 t h October 2011.    You were placed in the witness protection program and I think perhaps we should deal with that now at this stage.  If you could have regard to page 63 of your statement that you have given to the commission could you please tell the Chair being careful not to refer to names and have regard to the list of names that have been provided to you with this abbreviation which will be FM1, 2 or etcetera could you please tell the Chair the circumstances under which you ended up being placed in the witness protection program?    No it would be better if you can just refer to the list.    Yes.      Colonel Naidoo.    Just so that you can refresh your memory you are dealing with events that are dealt with on page 63 and 64 onwards of your statement.  If you just want to have a look there that will also help you with the – the FM names of the agents so you do not have to always look them up.    I apologise Chair.    I apologise Chair.    I apologise Chair.  I unfortunately was in Botswana last week when these …    Bundles were prepared for you but I will make sure that it rectified.    You can continue Colonel Naidoo. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Thank you.    Thank you.  After I was allowed to go and collect the docket from Gauteng I came back with the docket and I had already been informed because Mr Sesoko was not involved from the onset to say that I need to involve Mr Sesoko.  So I did attachment of the evidence that we – that I had already acquired and we evaluated the evidence in totality which gave birth to what is called the second report.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Mr McBride was not involved in the actual compilation however what happened is that because he was going to co-sign the document went to him for spelling check and it was returned to us until he was satisfied about the quality of the report.    The call was about the Minister wanting to see me personally.    Chairperson I still remember very well that they wanted to know whether when he wanted an update he – I had handed him a copy of the report.    Of the first report but I indicated to them that I handed a copy to Mr Sesoko who might have handed to McBride.    Handed it to McBride.    I never saw whether he …    He handed – not.    And yesterday when I was testifying I indicated that the report – there was a report which was sent to Mr Sesoko on the 23 r d which means that report had already changed.  So if I can say what I handed to Sesoko was a January report I would not really be very correct on the basis that they had that slight change only on recommendation that we cannot place General Sibiya at the scene.    I do not know Chairperson.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I do not know.    I received a call from the personal assistant to the Minister.  It was Minister Nhleko and she made it clear that she is the personal assistant of the Minister and she told me that the Minister wanted to meet me personally.  I then requested to know what was that about – she just gave me a highlight to say it is about the Rendition.  Then I indicated – I informed her that I would need permission from the Executive Director Mr McBride and I cannot be able to just go and meet with the Minister.  Then she suggested and that was I think on the subsequent call.  She suggested and said to me the Minister would want to meet with you in Cape Town over the weekend.  They will arrange transportation and McBride will never know.  Then on Sunday you will be back and then on Monday you will be able to report on duty.  Now I indicated to her that it does not matter it is over the weekend because if I come there I will be discussing issues pertaining to the department and the Accounting Officer must know.      No she indicated to me that she will talk to the Minister again.    That is when on the following day I received a call from the Minister himself.    Both these numbers were saved in my cell phone and I still have them today.    I may not remember but it may appear somewhere.    Because shortly after that I had spoken to the Executive Director.  There were some …    McBride.    There were some documents which were done.  I think they might have captured the date I cannot – but now I cannot remember the date.    But what I have it is …    That is correct.    But the exact date I cannot remember.    Yes.    His call lasted very – it might be less than – not even a minute.  He just said I want you to cooperate with Werksmans.  And then I said okay and then he terminated the call.    Yes.    That is correct.    No I had not yet had the interview with them.    They just call me requesting me to attend the…    Interview.    And I referred them to …    To the Executive Director.    At some stage there were some exchange I think of emails between them and Mr Sesoko.    Because I also indicated to them that even though the Executive Director is the head of the department.    Sesoko is the direct supervisor and I report direct to him.    So I gave them I think the email of Mr Sesoko and then they started liaising with him.    I cannot remember but the time lapse there was not really huge on the basis that after I indicated that I will not be able to meet with the Minister in Cape Town McBride was then suspended.    It did not take a month.    But I cannot really quantify in terms of…    Days.    Less than a month – less than a month – let us say…    Weeks.    Ja.    I just got an indication that probably Werksman had contacted him.    That is why he had to contact me.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct but I need to indicate clearly Chairperson that it is not the Minister himself who proposed Cape Town.  It is the PA saying the Minister wants to meet me with – with me in Cape Town.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    He phoned directly.    They were having different numbers.    He used a cell phone.    He introduced himself.    To say that he is the Minister of Police.    And I could hear the voice because I think few weeks he had come to our office and addressed us.    So I was really familiar with his voice.    That is correct.    It was Mr Israel Kgamanyane.    For me it was very unusual because politicians normally will not communicate with the staff.  They make communicate with heads of departments because they report direct to them.  So I felt that probably he wanted me to do something without Mr McBride knowing.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Shortly after the appointment of Mr Kgamanyane as the Acting Executive Director I was told by him to go to Duma Nokwe Chambers in Sandton to meet with Advocate William Mokhari.  In the morning I went there as I was instructed and when I arrived at the reception I just sat there and waiting for him.  He came down and never requested me to go with him to his office.  He spoke with me at the reception.  He was standing.  And I was standing because I was shaking his hand.    No that is Advocate Mokhari at Duma Nokwe Chambers.    That is correct.    Now he requested me to make a support affidavit a confirmatory affidavit in support of the Minister.  I then refused and I told him that if I do that I will be lying.  And he did not say anything.  He said no it is fine you can go back.  And then I left.  It was the shortest meeting I had.  Then I went back.    I had not yet seen it.  I – even now.    I do not know that affidavit.    I said that on the basis that this issue was on the media and the Minister had a version of what happened.  So now it immediately came to my awareness that what I have to confirm it is what he has been speaking publicly.    Because – and that was not the true reflection of what happened.    The version is that McBride altered – influenced me to alter the report.    The report was deleted to suit the recommendation that NPA cannot charge Dramat and Sibiya.    That is correct.  I had three interviews with them.  And in my first meeting with them they assured me – it was a panel of three or four – I think three and they assured me that the investigation they were doing will not result in a criminal or departmental recommendation against me or resulting in me being charged.  And I said is there a need for me to be legally represented?  And they said no.   I did not record that but we had discussed this at length with Mr Sesoko and Sesoko said we – you must not forget we need to raise this issue.  And I thought they captured it in their record.  For some reason I did not see that appearing.  And that is when I started to be free to talk to them after that assurance.      That is correct.    That is correct.    I checked the transcript because we once requested them when we were being charged but we could not get the audio. They sent the transcribed record.    And that part did not appear.    I think we might have asked for it but let me say I am speaking under correction now.    But my common sense tells me that if you are to do a [indistinct] you want to compare.    The difference between what is transcribed.    Because some words cannot be as audible as one may think.    I did after they introduced themselves.  They indicated that they are on record.    And then they introduced each other.  Then I started asking the question.  And that part I was fortunate enough because Mr Sesoko had a separate recording which he used himself and that was captured.    His one?    And it just gave me a consolation.    That I could not record but our situation was just exactly the same.    I am sure that if it is recorded it is there.  But let me just give a little bit of just…    What I can say Chairperson is that after they introduced themselves that is when I indicated that part regarding legal representation.  But the point that I am coming to Chairperson is that I am not sure whether they – but the recording was there in front of me.    So that part I may not know.    It was playing or…    I cannot really tell that much.    That is correct.    That was before they raised the point because they indicated they had a way where they did their things.  They would firstly indicate the day …    And mention the date and then after that they will say …    They are on record.    Hm.    What I can say I think it was after they said they are on record but what I remember vividly …    Is that it is after they introduced themselves.    Ja.    I - I think - I am okay.  We - we dealt with - with it …    But I think what will be a little bit of a challenge …    Would be if I get more time …    The recollection is …    Enhanced.    In terms of certain things.    Because how I articulated it in a confirmatory affidavit.    It was when things were still fresh.    That is correct.    That is correct.    More time to go through that confirmatory affidavit …    And the report itself.    That is …    I - I did it last night …    Because that is when you raise it Chairperson …    But …    Then if I can have a little bit of indulgence to …    Really make the difference.    Ja.    That part Chairperson I cannot remember.    I cannot remember.    That part Chairperson it - it is very difficult to say because I cannot remember whether they show me there …    But I saw it in this report     When I did the (intervenes).    That is correct.    This part it is - it is very misleading because my experience when I deal with prosecutors who are guiding the case quite often they are the ones who will take the decision on the matter and they model out that case in terms of what they can really prove in court. Now this also comes to the issue of the guidance of the report to say here they indicate that the - Advocates Mosing and Moletsi were guiding this report but the truth of the matter is that it is IPID that needs to make that report without the involvement of any advocate from the NPA because it is like when I am writing a letter to you but you write a letter to yourself.    You are communicating to yourself.    So it was supposed to be an independent one but I have already given a justification because of the closeness we had.  It just became so normal that it flew that they started commenting and …    For the first time when I had a meeting with Colonel Moukangwe at Emperors Place.    That meeting was aimed at him explaining to me the investigation he did, what was outstanding, what needed to be done.    So that is when he said there are prosecutors who are already guiding this investigation and he gave me their name and their numbers.    That is correct.    I remember because one - once I was given the number I called him.    That is correct.    I cannot remember whether I confirm …    But I indicated that I am now investigating this case which I heard that he was …    He was - he was dealing with and then we scheduled a meeting from there.    That is correct.    No.  I - I think there was a - a certain investigation like the Cato Manor which I indicated that I investigated first.  That is when I started to know Advocate Mosing but at that time we put dockets together and he told us what needed to be done but I think I had only one or two meetings with him. Then after that they put another person who was Advocate Mathenjwa.  So Advocate Mathenjwa came at a time when I was already on exit.  Then I had to meet with him.  That is the advocate who was very, very close who was telling them on a daily basis what to do but most of the activities I cannot really attest to because I used to get a telephone call from the team members. We still had a link even though I was not there.  They would tell me what was happening.  Some I used to advice.    Page?    I got it.    That is correct.  The - during the interview as I indicated …    We had the meeting with the reference group and they indicated that they were set up by the Minister to look into policing matters.  One of the members of the reference group was known to me because I walked with him summarily in KZN investigating Cato Manor and that is Advocate Mathenjwa. He gave me a call the other day after the meeting and he said to me he wants the copies of the rendition docket.  He was mentioning it in a - like as if he was demanding it but I - I never had a problem with that because we had some dealings in the past.  Probably he was so free to - to talk to me. I refused and I told him and I still remember I was no, no you need to speak with …    The Executive Director.    That is what happened.    He said it is okay.    Ja.    Chairperson in - in May 2015 that was 21 May I received a letter of precautionary suspension signed by the then Acting Executive Director Mr Kgamanyane.  The letter was served to me by Ms Netsianda.  That was after McBride was suspended around March 2015. Now she gave me a telephonic call and told me that she wanted to serve the suspension letter and apparently the Minister wanted me to receive that letter.  Now at that time she indicated that she was driving.  It was very late and I knew that she was going to cover between 200 or 250 to 300 kilometres to arrive in Polokwane.    I think it might have been around three or 4 o’ clock because she was leaving Pretoria I think around that time.    That is correct.    And then I said it is fine.  Whatever time you arrive I am going to wait for you and then I - the call was recorded.  I also sent it to the company that transcribed it and she also deposed a statement confirming that because I made her to listen to the call.  I still remember the day I made her listen.  She just said you are a witch.  Why did you record me?  So …    And said I am putting her at a very difficult position.    And I said even if you do not give a statement I have your …    Ja …    But the statement was not given direct to me.  I think she did a confirmatory to either …    McBride or Mr Sesoko.    It was.    I’m not really sure, but seeing previously I had received a call from the Minister, I realised that probably that the acting Executive Director was just being…[intervenes].    An instrument to achieve that goal.    That’s correct and probably to add on that Chairperson, if I had not had an experience where the Minister called me directly it would have been another issue, but because he had called me, I realised that these things above…[intervenes].    The Executive Director it’s no longer the interest of the Department there is somewhere where their interest is being said and I was not aware of that – what kind of interest they were saying.    Normally I would not really have – I would have doubted the words of the person.    Not necessarily, I would thought that probably she’s just trying to make the situation big, so that I feel compelled to cooperate but the previous call, I realised what I was dealing with.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.      That’s correct.    That’s Correct.    It was transcribed – I did it in Polokwane but it was – I think it was some weeks after the incident it took a bit of time before – I cannot remember exactly when but it was sometime after this call but I did it in Polokwane.    Yes and I think I can go to the company and get any record probably regarding this matter.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.    Ja she came to Polokwane.    That’s correct.    What she did was to appreciate my understanding and also compromising because I had to fit within her schedule.  I also had to gather all the things that I had to hand over to her.  I had a laptop, I had a 3G card, those things that I was using I had to hand over the items and I still remember she arrived, it was late, very late.    I do not know whether it’s eight or nine but it was late.   So when she phoned me…[intervenes].      It’s around three hours but I do not know what caused further delay because when she came, I saw she was with her husband.    So I realised probably she might have gone home first but she came late to Polokwane.    No and also from my side, I could not talk.  For me it was – I was not settled because it was my first time in my 16 or 17 years’ career in the IPID to be getting that…[intervenes].    Ja so I was really unsettled, so I could not really formulate any discussion about anything.    It was a shock, it was a big shock.    That’s Correct.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.      That’s correct.    Ja all the correspondence I think they were coming from Mr Kgamanyane.    That’s correct.    I think the decisions were coming from people outside the department and in this case I suspect the Minister.      I think if I try Chairperson I can also get it from the lawyer.    Because he might be having …[intervenes].    That’s correct.    That’s the one.    Ja.   I think there were but…[intervenes].    What I can say Chairperson is that the one that I remember I don’t think – they did not bring the person who is at this level.    Chairperson I understand that, but I think I looked at it to say, if really you want to draw blood from the stone you need experts probably because you get your normal people, they may not be able to achieve that with ease.    Ja I don’t remember where they brought a heavyweight like this.    It was not often but also considering that our department, more especially on a higher level, you don’t really get a lot of misconduct cases.    It would be once after a while.    There was one which was done for the person who was in a Provincial Head for KZN and the one which was done for the Provincial Head of Eastern Cape but these, I don’t think they brought any senior person.     Any senior lawyer because we are very economical with our budget.   That one I cannot really…[intervenes].      I remember most especially on the KZN one because it was coinciding with the time when I was going to assist the Province but I cannot remember what was the level of that person, I cannot remember.     Okay.        That’s correct.    That’s correct.    The disciplinary inquiry was held on the 17 t h of July 2015 but on that day it was postponed, we finally had it on the – it was set for the 13 t h, 14 t h and 17 t h of August and we made an application for suspension of that hearing pending outcome of the Constitutional Court which was brought about by McBride and the Chairperson dismissed that application…[intervenes].    I think that’s the one, he was the Chairperson.    Now we finally had it on the 22 n d and 23 r d of September 2015.  What happened on that particular day, Mr Sesoko could not avail himself because he was not well.  Now they requested that we need to separate this hearing so that they could have some progress.  I was represented by Advocate Phooko, let me say I might be just using the word Advocate loosely but it’s a lawyer.    Ja.    Now what happened is that, while we were there Advocate Makari went out with – he requested my lawyer to say, let’s go out and have a discussion.  It was after there was an issue of separating the hearings.  Now when they went out, he came in but Mr Phooko called me and he says, come I want to talk to you.  Then I went out and he said to me – and I just want to indicate how he put it, he says, these people are proposing that we need to settle this case and he used the word – they say if you continue they’re going to fire you, it does not matter what you are going to say.  Now that part…[intervenes].    If I continue.      Ja and lead evidence, they are going to fire me.   So they’re proposing a…[intervenes].   He said, no matter what evidence you are going to lead there, they are not going to take it, they are going to fire you.  So it also gave me a bit of surprise on the basis that he was one person who was saying – he was enjoying doing my case, he said, this one it’s just going to be a walk in the park.    I was preparing, I was telling him.    He was very, very confident.    He said this is what they are saying.  Now I had a very lengthy discussion and I said, I think I need to talk to Mr Sesoko.  I gave him a call sometimes we had a discussion with Mr Sesoko’s lawyer.    And the discussion there was to discuss the issue of how we are going to do that because immediately when he said they were going to fire me I started to panic.     Because when you receive such type of information.    The first thing that you think is how are you going to pay for your car?      How are you going to pay for your house?    You switch off completely.    From the amount of evidence that you can have.    Because the fate has been decided.    Now I tried to speak to Mr Sesoko and Mr Sesoko he was warning me.    To say he does not think that it is right idea.    To settle.    And he also indicated that once you settle they will take you as dishonest.  Because you settle on a level that you accept this and you go back to work.  Now I went back to my lawyer it was like to and fro.  We were discussing trying to find out – and my lawyer was telling me, do you want to keep your job let us just get these things wrapped up.  And he was telling me that the way I spoke with the council you are not going to make it.  Whatever we are going to do they are going to deal with you.  Now…    Ja this…    That is correct.    Now I then – I phoned my wife, I phoned my uncle it was all calls all over.      Trying to get…    That is correct.    Now it came to a part where – what I did…    He told me immediately.    That they are going to give you a warning.    A final warning.    Written warning.    Now and there was this…    That is correct.    He said I need to make a statement admitting to the wrongdoing of the report.  Now that part I refused from the onset.  And I said it cannot be.  Because I will be lying. I did not do what they say I have done.  Now what he did he also went back to [indistinct] and they discussed.    But the following day because I even stopped everything there and I said I need to go and sleep on this issue.    Yes.    Ja I said I was going to sleep.  They gave me a chance.    Ja.      It was in the afternoon.    I cannot remember whether it was nine or ten.    It was in the morning.    But when it was towards or in the afternoon.    That is when…    They indicated that okay we are going to give you an opportunity go and think about it.    Now I went…    To the following day.    I went to the hotel I continued with the calls.    They – it had slightly changed because they were proposing something.  They were trying to bend to what I was…    To compromise.    Because I said I cannot …    Ai.    And they were – they were slightly mentioning the issue of what if we do an agreement.    Ja an agreement.    You can – that is correct.    But even the issue of the settlement agreement they were the ones who came up with – because that word was not even in my mind.    The one who came with it and they indicated that if we do an agreement where this issue is resolved we want you to come back to…    You keep your job, you come back to work.    And I want to tell you when you have been suspended for the first time in your over 20 years’ experience in different sectors or in government I have never met that.    To tell you the honest truth my mind switched into survival mode.    And I said what do I do to save my family.    But I was not ready to compromise the issue that I was not going to put a statement.    Because a main investigator I know you cannot really put the statement on same issue different.    Because I said this is the position but I need to keep my job I want my job back.  Now then I went to the hotel and then I continued with the calls.  And that time I was not only confined to – to only relatives.  I was calling even the friends in government, in – who have senior positions because we normally know – communicate and – and they were telling me that if they are giving you that deal let me tell you one thing with our government they are going to fire you the [indistinct].  That was one of the friends that is what he said to me.    He say with this government of ours when they want to get rid of you…    They will get rid of you.  It does not matter what you do.    So now they are giving you a life line.    At least you will – you will carry this shame just for a bit but you will come…    You will be back at work.    Now…    I was getting.    Now then I – the following day then we had to engage in the issue of that settlement agreement.  They went and drafted it.    No I had already decided that as long as whatever I am going to sign it is not going to make me to commit perjury.  That is what I told myself.    As long as I …    That is correct.    And my wife was very supportive of the fact that it is better to go back to work and really continue sustaining the family.  Now when I went back they drafted the – it did not take too long     An agreement.  Now the agreement the first page it was talking about …    287.    When they brought the agreement the – it was already typed.  There was a…    They had something that has already been drafted which I…    Ja which I – when I pointed some of the things I do not know how it was changed.    And then I was called to a smaller office to sit and discuss.  Now when it came back now we discussed and my lawyer was happy with it.  He was really fine.      Now if you check the part of the agreement it is where he talks about plea to the charges as per departmental hearing charges.    But the issue there when we got this – this report I was still not comfortable – I was still not comfortable with this part.    When I signed.  In fact I said to my lawyer when we were doing this that this fist page I am having a problem with it. But he indicated that this is an agreement there is nothing – it does not have any effect on what you said previously.    And they have already indicted that I am free to testify in support of Mr Sesoko.    Yes which was important to me.  Now I do not know being out of sarcastic or what but I took this agreement and did not want to sign the first page.  And it was initialled by my lawyer.  It was only the page where he initialled.  And I signed the subsequent one.  So my lawyers initials     Are only on the first page.    LEP stand for Poko.    Ja.  If you check that HI – HI was basically for me when I was preparing this thing for the – for this hearing.    It was not there ja.    Yes.    Ja.    That MS is the police officer who certified the documents.    And then you have a signature towards the corner that…    It is initialled at the corner there.  If you check there is a…    Ja a [indistinct]    That is the head of Legal Services.    Ms Morashe[?].    Marine Morashe    And if you check there that signature there it is similar to the one in the subsequent page which is…    The second page.    I had a discomfort with the first page.    Yes.    That is correct.    That is correct.    No I was – I was – for some reasons.    I was just not comfortable.  I knew that when I sign at the end it binds me of course.    But the truth of the matter is that I was just really not comfortable.    And it seems as in terms of negotiation on the proposed offer that was the cul-de-sac for us.  There was no way I could go.    That is correct.    I will just request you to – to just repeat that?    Thank you.      I have the agreement.    That is correct.    I was very uncomfortable.    That is correct Chair.    Chairperson and actually for me to look at the charges of dishonesty and look at what they were bargaining with me to say this is the sanction.  It could not really – it could not balance.  To say a warning when somebody say you have been dishonest in the department.  It – more especially as my level.    I would have expected the employer to say whatever may.    We are not really settling.    So I think the strategy was they put a dangling carrot to say we are going to give you this warning.    For this serious, serious, serious charge and I took it on the basis that I felt a warning but the charges which they were saying they were very serious – they were not balanced.  It was not proportional.  Ja.    The reason for signing for…    As I have indicated and I think that part is squarely falling in my warning statement.  Because I reflected exactly to how I reached that level to such an extent that I said to myself I have never been in that situation before with the department.  I came from the private sector and everywhere I go I was the most abused employee.  In terms of the work because I had to do a lot of work.  Now the thing was even though the position was so senior the picture came that you took yourself to the university.  The struggles, the pain of which many people had been saying to me you managed to reach a level where the position is regarded as a political – they normally appointed directors from a ruling party.  And I am there in this position and I said I am just me.  So that part it kind of really took the sense of the implication and I was stuck with the reality of how I reached there.  It was difficult but I never saw an alternative.      That is correct.  The first …    I was before the settlement agreement the first thing which I was requested to do was to sign a statement acknowledging that I lied.  I altered the report.  That was done by Advocate Mokhari.  I refused.    I said no I cannot do that and that is when the issue of the settlement agreement kicked in.    It was on the first day.    Where we had …    He had already went out with the lawyer.    Yes.    That part I refused.    I indicated that I cannot really do that because I will be lying.    Yes.  They wanted me to say that they forced me.    To alter the report.    Yes.    That is correct.    No I did not see the affidavit.    They were saying that we need you to - to do an affidavit where you say that Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko forced you to change that report.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I went to Mr Sesoko.  I found him at the hospital.    The same day.    I - I went to the hospital and I told him what transpired but he had already known the details because I kept him abreast telephonically …    In terms of these developments.    When I was meeting with him he was - he - he was not really in supportive of what I did but he was more relaxed.  We - we could talk about and I said no rest assured I did not implicate you there …    And …    I cannot remember.    I think it was with my lawyer.    I think it was with my lawyer.    That is correct.    Then I went back to Polokwane.  Suddenly the - I do not know whether it was on television or on newspaper but there - there was an issue of saying IPID investigator has now spilled it all.  He implicated McBride and Mr Sesoko.    It was in the media.  There was some talk about it.    Now I received a call from Mr Sesoko and he wanted to know whether I implicated him and I was - I was very angry.  I was very angry because number one I knew that that agreement my lawyer would not really leak it to the media.  So I started to have doubts because the other copy - my understanding was given to the employer.  Who then leaked this thing and also they are distorting.  They are not putting the way it happened.  So I said to Mr Sesoko I said you know what we had a discussion and an agreement that I can even testify in support of your - your disciplinary hearing …    And I said I am going to do a confirmatory - confirmatory affidavit.    I did not waste time.  I went - drafted.  I went to the police station …    And after - I think I did an assent to him or something …    But I finally signed it at the station.    Then I give it to - to him.  I do not know what he did with that.    The affidavit explained what had happened …    And also indicating …    In fact it is in line with other affidavits like the confirmatory affidavit that I deposed in support of McBride earlier.    That is correct.    Just a little - ja.  That is - that is the one.  That is correct.    That is correct and if I want to add it is also in line with what is in - in Werksmans Report.  There is a paragraph they talk about the interview and says Mr Khuba indicated that he never received any instruction …    To exonerate anyone.    That is correct and also in - as part of that my lawyer deposed a confirmatory affidavit in terms of what happened during that process.   I reported on duty on 28 September.  That was the Monday because it was concluded I think it was around Friday.  Early in the morning while I was having a meeting with my staff telling them that I am back and I wanted to check how they were doing in terms of the work.  I received a call - telephonic call from Mr Kgamanyane.  He asked me why did you depose to this statement.  I told him that it is because it is the truth and then after that we had some discussions but on the 29 t h that is when I received a letter to state reasons in writing why I should not be dismissed.  Those - that letter was delivered.  It was delivered late.    On the 29 t h.    I think it was the 29 t h.    I think it was on Tuesday if I am not mistaken.    Was the 28 t h …    And then he indicated to me in that letter …    To say I must not - I must tell him why he must not replace the final written warning …    With dismissal.    He gave some background on the top to say …    You concluded this agreement.    Now you deposed a statement …    And when I got that I still remember I could not continue.  I had to leave the office.  I went and consulted with the doctor because I was really depressed.  I could start to see where it was going.    That is correct …    And my expectation there was that if anyway they wanted to discipline me.    The first process had already been concluded.    They were supposed probably to initiate a new process …    And use that agreement as an aggravation.    The way I know the …    The Labour Relation processes.    Now I did not involve the lawyer.    I drafted my own response.    I indicated in my response …    That I do not know who leaked that - the information about the agreement …    And that I think that agreement was done in bad faith …    And I stated that I was ready that the agreement can be withdrawn …   And face the disciplinary hearing.    I was ready for that.    I indicated in the letter.    I - I have reached that point …    Because I have realised that it seems as if there was threat which was used.    Now let me go and really face this …    Hearing …    And then give all I had …    In order to prove my innocence.    Now I - I sent that letter …    I cannot remember the exact time when I emailed it …    But in the afternoon …    There was a person from Head Office.    That day I did not go to work because when I consulted with the doctor the doctor had given me the medication.  So I decided to be at home and say I will not be able to go to work.  Now I - I was told that there is somebody on the way delivering a letter. Now I was so - so surprised but I felt this letter is the letter of dismissal.  I went to the gate.    Yes.    Yes.    Then I went to the gate because it is an estate setup and I went to collect the letter and I got the letter.  It meant you are dismissed with immediate effect.    Hm.    No hearing.    I remember very well how I reached the gate but I do not remember how I reached the - the house.    That is correct.    The biggest problem is that it seemed as my mind was separated from my body.    I was with my son but when I went back I do not remember whether he was there.    Now - and I was walking barefoot.    I collected.  I went back.    I could not remember what happened but I remember while I was in the house …    Then it started to sink in …    That I am now dismissed …    From the employment.    That is what I was seeking avoid …    But I want to say Chairperson that …    I somehow got the consolation …    Later very late.    The consolation was when I heard in the news …    That Mr Sesoko was fired when he was admitted in hospital     Without leading any evidence.    I realised that what I did was simply to cross the bridge early …    But anyway I had to cross.    That is correct.    It was - it was a gentleman called Mosie but I remember the time there was my Deputy Provincial Head came at the gate.    So he was used to hand deliver that letter to me and I accepted the letter …     And he then went back …    But from Head Office it was a gentleman who was - it was - he was from Gauteng.    I cannot remember the name now.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I - I think the way it happened looking at when the - the report was - was sent.  Even though I cannot remember vividly the times.  I got this sense that the person was already dispatched before they could even entertain what I have written because my understanding is that when you have a representation if you are an Executive Director you will apply your mind and request maybe to have a meeting with your Legal Services or Labour Relations and consider the reason - evaluate them and then decide on the decision but the way it happened so quick when I sent it in the morning or around nine. I do not know whether it was nine or 10 and you have in the afternoon a person there.  It really shows that it was just what they requested me to do was just a formality.    I think I emailed Chairperson.    Hm.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Ja.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct Chairperson.    That is correct and Chairperson …    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    It is 100?    Okay.  I am - I am there.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Okay.  3-0-2.  Okay.    That’s correct.    I received a visitation from Brigadier Ramela and Colonel Mahlangu of the Hawks and…[intervenes].   That’s correct Chairperson because my understanding is that if then what he was saying was true why did he stomach the first one.    He would not have negotiated to have that settlement agreement because we talk about dishonest but the truth of the matter is, they were using me to say, how can they get me to turn me against McBride and Mr Sesoko and when it backfired now they play this strict employer, why are you – why did you depose this statement?    Mr Kgamanyane was one of my best friends in the department.    Before he became acting.    To such an extent that we used to call each other even over the weekend, we were very, very close and when we were attending either strategic planning, when we would go to eat we would eat [indistinct] sit together because our offices – our provinces were regarded as the best performing.    Provincial Head.    While me being in Limpopo.    Normally they wouldn’t find staff with us.    And it’s just that he was not utilised in the investigation of high profile cases or setting up offices.    Then when this thing happened it really gave me a shock but somehow I just understood it this way, some people are so ambitious to such an extent that when they are looking for a bigger position, integrity no longer matters, so I just felt that way and really it was like – and I just want to put this part so that Chairperson can understand because after my dismissal when I was struggling with how am I going to run my life I realised that I have put in petrol claim of the travelling that I did while I was doing this hearings.  That petrol claim was supposed to pay me R8 000, I phoned head office -  I think it was paid maybe eight months or sometime.  I phoned head office, our policy says they pay the claim within 30 days.  Now when I checked and I kept on phoning, phoning then one of the employees told me, we were told not to process your claim because if we pay you this money you’re going to pay the lawyer and try to fight back, they want you to suffer.    That’s correct, so what I did I went to another lawyer in Polokwane, not Mr Phooko I was using, we wrote numerous letters saying we would have to go to Court you have to pay me the thing and they ended up not paying, they paid way after.    After I had gone to the Labour Court to – it was way after.    No I did not on the basis that because I was far from Pretoria I could not have engagement with him and I avoided him to make any call to him.    So he would use someone to serve me so I think with Mr Sesoko it was easier because he resides around there.    On the 3 r d of October 2015 it was approximately three days after my dismissal I received a visitation from Brigadier Ramela and Colonel Mahlangu of the Hawks.   When they were there, I did not even -  I was not aware because when you enter through the gate you need to get approval the security, they will telephone the house but I was just surprised when they were there, I don’t know how did they get access.  So they entered the house and then we – before they could sit down they were like moving in the sitting room, so my garage it’s facing the sitting room, they could see the car parked there and they could see – they checked the house and they were saying you have such a big house, it might be expensive on a monthly basis?  You have a beautiful car, now because you’re not working it might be really, really difficult and I was surprised because they were saying these things before we could even start to – they were just doing like this, ah the house is nice but how are you going to pay for this house because now you are not working?  Then when I told them we can sit, they said, Mr Khuba we have a solution for you…[intervenes].      Before they could even sit down, they said they had a solution for me, they’re having something good for me, then we sat down.  They were having a docket and fortunately that docket, I was able to check because while I was seated you know, I just become suspicious why there is a docket when these people are visiting me.  So that docket, I wrote the case number down, not while I was with them, after they had left and now the – what they did was to explain to me, they were very direct, but I need to indicate the person who was talking was the junior Colonel, because they introduced themselves, the Senior Brigadier Ramela was always – just quiet.    He was quiet, not talking much.   The person who was a spokesperson was…[intervenes].    Mahlangu and that is when he said we want you to make a statement that will implicate Dramat – not Dramat, Mr Sesoko and McBride and then you are going to be…[intervenes].    Ja so that you can be reinstated.    No they were very direct with me there, they never duck and dive.    Now I refused, I said no I can’t, why should I make that statement and I saw a charge…[intervenes].    They indicated…[intervenes].    Because they said they forced you to do – to alter the report isn’t it, then I said no, they didn’t force me.  Now I’d already seen the charge there in the docket so I just started to talk to them and say, no, no they persuaded, persuaded, persuaded, came with tricks, you know it’s going to be difficult to sustain yourself, how are you going to pay this and what he was talking, he was really playing with my emotions, he was really playing with my emotions.  Somewhere somehow I felt to say, really why this guy is saying this thing because it was – you know when you have just gone through a traumatic situation pictures are not far fetched, immediately a person mentioned a word it just comes.  So he was telling me what I – I even asked myself how I’m going to pay and he says, no we’re going to help you Ntlemeza sent us here.    They said General Ntlemeza sent us here.    The Hawks yes, and he said he’s going to make everything in his power that you go back to work.  Now I knew once bitten twice shy but I wouldn’t have done a statement but I realised this is coming again, it’s coming again and after that, after we had a discussion then they…[intervenes].    The discussion ended when they were saying they will come the following day, they wanted me to think about it and if it’s possible you can consult with your lawyer, any person, this is good for you.  They were just indicating how, you know it will really assist me.  Then the following day, I’m not recollecting completely what happened but it seems as they came again…[intervenes].    The following day and we could not understand each other…[intervenes].    No that was October.    2015 Yes.    Then they left again.    They wanted to know from me whether I thought about it and they were like playing like my friends, please we are going to help you.      Very, very nice.    I think it was the two of them I don’t remember any person coming there, now…[intervenes].    No the discussion was whether you have spoken with your lawyer, what happened what is the decision that you have taken, I said, no I can’t.    They still insisted to say we want to help you if you have a problem just give us a call and they were saying they were leaving and then they left but at that time I was under a medication, I think I used it for almost a week.    And it made me to kind of really sleep, I would sleep sometimes from 9 o’clock until 4.    4PM and again in the evening I would just sleep.    But I only use it for – I think for a week and then while I was just – I think I was in my sleep, I think – ja I was in my sleep or just woken up, I got a call from Mahlangu, that is the call that was recorded, it was recorded because I had an app on my phone that would record every call but I will just choose which one I want to save.    Now – then that is when they said to me, but he was a little bit diplomatic in the call.    But he was reiterating what he said, to say that, you know your enemies, if you make this Ntlemeza, you know Ntlemeza will reinstate you, I just felt that he was a little bit cautious unlike when he was there.     In the house then…[intervenes].    What I remember is that he said make a statement against your enemy.    Ja put it, because he was indicating this people, Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride are my enemies.    My close friend is General Ntlemeza because I’ve been interacting with him for quite some time.      So – and he said they would want me to make a statement.  So I was – I was like dizzy I just okay I never engaged with them and even the first part, it indicated that there was something wrong with me because I even thought it was Phooko, I said Mr Phooko because I thought it was my lawyer but it was later that I realised that it was Colonel Mahlangu because he was there in the house but I also want to add that even from that call I realised that the medication was not really doing me any good, I still remember  my wife saying, let’s put this in the dustbin you go and see how you look for a job outside, even if you pick up papers as long as our kids eat and that was the last time I…[intervenes].    Yes.    Recover.    So it was the issue of that just step down and make whatever you can make.     That is correct.    Yes and including that you will be reinstated.    That’s correct.    That’s correct.    No what happened, I am the one who gave him a call, it was on Monday because he was supposed to come on Monday.    And that is when I said I was in Pretoria and I said I won’t be available.    That is correct.    Ja just to say I am not going to available at home.    He was going to come again on Monday because he wanted to see whether I have changed my mind.    I think if we check…    Let me go to the – just to refresh my mind.  Telephone conversation.  The transcript where is it?    310.  Okay.  Okay there it says – “No man thanks I will talk to Brigadier maybe tomorrow to finalise the appointment on Monday.”    That is it.    Ja.    ja.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    It was very, very short.      I do not remember having said anything further than that.    And he just said okay.    No.    I do not remember.    No there was …    Hm.    Okay.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    I received a visitation again from members of the Hawks it was on the 24 t h February 2016.    That is correct.    It was Brigadier Xaba.  It was Sewela I do not remember the rank.    Okay.  And Colonel Maluleke.    And those three when they came.    I cannot remember.    I cannot remember whether there was any appointment made.     That is correct.    And that is when they told me about the case of defeating.    Ends of justice.    And fraud.  But when they showed me the case number I realised that it is the same case number that I have already quoted it in my Labour Court papers long time ago during the initial visit in…    Ja in October.    Ja.    But this time the charge had changed.  It is no longer perjuries now.    Fraud and …    Defeating the ends of justice.    Yes.  And they told me that they were investigating – they wanted my warning statement.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.  Yes continue.    So I then agreed that I will submit a statement.    They told me about the charges and they gave me questions.  They were questions I think they were up to I think it was 21 or cannot remember vividly now.  But those questions were written down to say did you do a report with Colonel Moukangwe?  Did you sub – those type of things?    And what I did…    There were no not – they…    No they just indicated that there is this case of alteration of report.    We want to obtain a warning statement from you.    That is correct.    Then I took the questions and I said I am going to submit a warning statement.    Of which I did.    But I think I need to put this in context.  Because that was for the first time that I told myself that now here I am going to say it all.      In my statement.  At that time I had not yet even told McBride about the visitation I got from…    Ntlemeza, Mdluli and that one was …    Sorry Ntlemeza.    Telling me about being seen by…    General Mdluli.    Those parts – those details…    Even Mr Sesoko did not know.    Now I felt that this time let me open the lid and I was doing it out of the feeling that I held the secret which if I do not say it out it will never be known.  So I then did the statement.  When I did the statement at the bottom there when I finalised the statement then I started to respond to those questions.  I think my warning statement were almost eleven pages then.    And then two or three or one page – let us say around two pages might have been the response to the questions.    Now I took the warning statement and went to the office of Brigadier Xaba.  He had hired or requested somebody to give him an office in Polokwane.    So it directed me where I had to submit that statement.    From – I think they were from Gauteng.    Then what happened there I gave him the statement.  I was accompanied with a lawyer whom I requested from Limpopo.  The one who assisted me to write those letters demanding for R8 000.00. Now this lawyer was that he read the statement – we sat there.      I will check that.    Then the – we handed – I handed over the statement.  Before I could sign because there are some processes that need to be followed when you are take – you are obtaining a warning statement.  It is not simply an issue of signing and – he read it and pre – he prepared something that entails the rights of the person so that one could understand as a suspect that whatever he says is going to be used in the court of law.  Now when he read it he said to me – in the middle he just stopped.    It was …    Brigadier Xaba.    Ja.    I was there I was seated there because I wanted to sign.    He read it and he took my warning statement somewhere in the middle he put it on the table.  [Indistinct] Mr Khuba was he this necessary to say? That is what he asked.    I said to him for me it was necessary but my lawyer was quick to say you cannot really tell what the suspect needs to say.  It is his right.  So he then took and he was no longer willing. I could see that he took the page where I was just had to sign.    But he was not really …    He was not happy.    He was not happy.    Then after that I signed and I requested a copy which I got.     That is correct.    That is correct.    I could not see what he was reading but somewhere somehow while he was reading – he took a bit of time but he reach a part where he seems as he could not continue    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    We firstly went to the so called CATS office that the office of a unit headed by Brigadier Xaba which was responsible for crimes against the state.  We had a meeting saying that we are going to be appearing on this date.  We had a discussion of the bail – bail.    Chairperson I would want to cover that part because there is also a bargaining council.    Which I want to talk to.  If you allow me I can start with it?    And just indicate what happened before I come to the issue of the arrest.    That is correct.    I can deal with the Labour issue.    Now.    And just finalise so that – because the arrest took place.    Ja.    The labour issue as I indicated to – in my letter to Mr Kgamanyane which of course he did disregard was that I was going to make an application at the high court.    To request …    Setting aside of the settlement agreement.  I had already spoken to a person working at the labour – at the union – the PSA and already indicated that you need to come and see me so that we can discuss this issue.  Now I then had a subsequent meeting with him and he said the urgent application PSA will not be able to cover.  And that is when I then turned to another lawyer.    It was an urgent application.    Because I wanted them to set aside.  When I had a discussion with my lawyer not Mr Poko the new one now.      It was somebody else.  It was the one who was helping Mr Sesoko.  It was Mr Mathibe.    Ja.  And I requested – then he advised that when you challenge     A dismissal you do not have to challenge per se the agreement because these are labour matters.    You need to go through to the labour court.    Now I followed the advised it is correct and then we started to work.  He gave me the bill I accepted it in the – I did not have money.    Yes to say.    We will see it later I just want the thing to be sorted out.    We were given the date of – when was that – that was the 15 t h I cannot remember very well but it was shortly after the – they were very quick.  They give us the date.  And the advocate was helping me.    Was a junior advocate and he said no he is confident that we are going to really make it.  But when we went there I think the argument of the employer was that this matter is not urgent.  They did not dwell on the…    On the merits on the subject.  Now after that it means that I had to wait for the bargaining council.    Ja.    Ja.    Now Mr Poko had prepared papers and then we were given a date for the conciliation part.  And I still remember the employer representative was there.  I went there I was also represented by Mr Poko.    When we – we had a discussion because they wanted us to state the case and then the employer rep also stated the case. During your discussion the employer representative indicated that we were given mandates not to settle or entertain this.    That is correct.    Now she wanted to know the facts what happened and there and there she indicated that you are not going to succeed here.  Why did you not have a hearing – they were talking and they were just really…    They know we were told to come and do this.    And then after that we left.  That is the first time that I had a meaningful smile.  That somebody coming from an institution has already gathered these facts.  And then after that we waited now for arbitration.  It took for quite some time.  Then we were told – and they decided that because there was no hearing we are not going to lead any evidence.  We are going to prepare arguments.  And I still remember we – they did a research – there was also a similar case like mine and they say an employer cannot replace any sanction by a chairperson.  When the chairperson decide you cannot do anything.  Because you have appointed that chairperson to represent you as an employer and his decision about the matter it is what closes the case.    I think you are correct Chairperson.    Okay.    And then we did our submission.  I was very, very, very confident.  Now after that I was told that within fourteen days I am going to get the award.  It might have taken more than 30 or 35 days.  Now there was this person whom I was – I got his number – he was the person who was dealing with.  Because when I phoned the bargaining council they told me that if you want award you deal with this person.  So I was dealing with that person.  Now when it come to the 21 s t I could not take it anymore and I said – can you tell me what is happening?  And he says – no, no, no I will come back to you they are busy dealing with this issue.  And I was phoning him daily.  I would not mind that I called him the previous day I will keep on calling him.  Now this other day – that was the day before he sent a report.  He mentioned something that I felt there is something going on.  And – but I down played because you desire certain results you kind of really    And it came through that is the following day.  When it came through I read the report.  I could not believe the finding.      The finding was that my position was so senior that it did not require that hearing.  That Mr Kgamanyane later requesting me to explain why I did not – why I depose a statement amount to affording me with an opportunity similar to a hearing.    He said the dismissal was both fair and he indicated another word which I cannot remember now.    Something like that.    But I looked at this report and I had to call my lawyer.  And one time after these presentations were served my lawyer said to me the chairperson of the hearing is the gentleman I work with because I am sometimes requested by the bargaining council to – he knows him very well.    He knows him very well.  Now I was not really settled on the basis that they – on the basis that the know each other.  I was settled on the basis that my case is strong.  He is going to be objective.  And then after that when I got this I phoned my lawyer and my lawyer said to me Mr Khuba you can just suspect what happened.  This case involves big people politician and he dropped the phone.  And that part I realised that I was dealing with bigger monster than what I thought.  I then – at the time I had not yet claimed my patience.  I was just working.  You know I started something putting in boards that I can clean carpets going to houses.  And now I was doing that.    To earn a living.  Then I said to my wife I said I do not want to stop that job.  But let me claim my pension so that when I have deficit I will just take probably a little bit of interest and drop into the deficit so that I can be able to break even.  And she agreed.  Because I really realised there that the journey was going to be long.  I realised the journey was going to be long.      Having heard that to get your case finally heard by Labour Court it will take nearly two years.  So I realised that the journey was going to be long and then I started to – the reality started to sink in at that time.    That is correct.    That is correct.  And when the PSA studied the report I still remember I met with the head now not with the person who was assisting me initially.  The head of PSA at a Provincial level and he just said I cannot believe these findings.  And what he did then was to say I will motivate that they approve the review of this and that is what he did.    There was a review application and I got – there was a final judgment which was made I think it was April 2017    17.  It was almost a year and …    2017.  It was a year and seven months or …    The order was made that the dismissal was both - was unfair.    It was a contrary of what …    The person said, ja.    Hm.    I was reinstated and also the order was like very - somehow I felt that it was a little bit …    Not unfair.    Because the department was given only five days to pay …    To pay back - I mean …    My back pay.    But finally what - of course the one which I was really interested I was really happy about …    It was going back to work. Even if they had said they will take another year to pay.    I never had a problem.    Yes.    That is why when the employer approached me they said there is this order.    We have a problem that we cannot just implement it.    The space is very short.  We requested that you give us some more time.  I …    He was already back.    He was already back.    That is correct.    Ja.    And then I - I came back to the department …    And …    That is correct including all the benefits.    Ja.    You see Chairperson sometimes I was happy …    But sometimes we normally gain more than what - we normally gain less than what we lost.    Ja.    Because to go …    And start rebuilding the pension again is another issue.    When I went back to SARS to say I want to - to pension fund.    I want to deposit back my money.    They told it is such a big penalty …    And I realised that it is going to be very …    Difficult.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Ja.  I was arrested on the 16 t h and …    It was - let me just …    Ja.    I was arrested on 16 March 2016 for defeating the ends of justice and I think just - to just give a little bit is that I thought probably we are just going to go there and appear.  They are going serve us with J175 but we were arrested.  We went through the cells and it was - it was very traumatic for me because we - we went through - we had a group of other people who were going for court. We were put in a big hall where there were other suspects or criminals or - but I think what - what was happening was everybody was staring at us.    On the basis that we were the only people wearing suits (indistinct).    And they were requested - they requested a belt.  I still remember I took out mine.  Fortunately the trouser was - trouser was very tight.  I could not hold it by my hand.    I then - we then went for fingerprints.  We then joined others again and after that they decided to give us our belts back …    And I think there was mention one officer indicated because Mr McBride had a problem with the issue of the belts.    He said why would you need these belts …    And then they said - he said what if you hang yourself and Mr McBride says …    Mr McBride indicated that he had been in the (indistinct) for some time …    Waiting to be hanged and never decided to die.  Why would he hang himself by this thing that does not have any - it does not have a head and a tail and then - that is when he decided to give us our belts back.  They gave us a small cell.  We went and sat there and then we went to court.    Hm.   I am also implicated Chairperson.    We had three court appearances if I remember well and then they were just being postponed and we realised that the state was just buying time.  They will refuse to give us a certain part of the docket that we have right over and they indicated that no, no, no that is sensitive information. So we ended up saying no, no, no you can keep whatever you keep.  What you are giving us we are going to use that and that is when we appeared on 1 November 2016 and I was ready with my statement in order to plea to say I plead not guilty and that is when the prosecutor refused to continue with the case. We pressurised him saying we want to continue.  He said no this case is not winnable.  There is a Constitutional Court judgment.  You people were doing your work.  There were a lot of just explanation juggling around.    That is correct.    He was saying that.    He also said that now the witnesses do not want to come forward and testify and we were surprised because there is a - a remedy for that.  You subpoena a witness …    But they said no they - they cannot do that until they said no they are withdrawing.    They - they spoke about - the witness whom they were speaking about was the person who accompanied me to take a docket and anyone will know that that person did not participate in …    The report.    He only filed the docket …    and he indicated that no I accompanied him …    And I said I accompanied him.    He accompanied me.  What was that?  What was that?  What was …    Of evidential material …    In his statement?    But they say because McBride is back he may not want to testify but I just realised that no, no that was just an excuse.    Hm.   It was Sandile July of Werksmans …    Because they indicated that he was not ready when he was ready to go to court …    In order to challenge.    He was refusing to testify …    But I could not understand if then Mr July can sub - submit a report and recommend criminal charges.    And now he turns around and says no, no I rather to go to court and challenge you to say I do not want to go and testify.    It was strange.    That is correct and - and my - my assessment there was that I do not think these things were intended …    To have ultimate result of serving justice.    It was simply to have quick wins …    Because you can charge me.  That is process …    But when you have to prove there …    In front of the …    The Judge.    Hm.    That is correct.    The Public Protector’s Report is challenging.  I am just going to give a quick indication of what really happened.   The Public Protector recommended …    That a number of people within IPID be charged …    But for some reasons …    I am also …    Disciplinary.    I am also part of that because of an appointment of a specialist who deals with cellphone analysis but what happened is that the post was advertised and they did short listing.  I was not there.    I think they did.  They did the advert even - before I even arrived in I - I was reinstated.    Now the other day because I was given a responsibility to head the task team - all task teams in the IPID.    Now I was working in Head Office and then I wanted to go to the lift and then I was told that there is an interview and one of the panel members was not there.  They requested me to assist and I indicated to them that when you assist in the panel you need to be appointed. So I said because I am only participating in the - in the interview I request that you get permission.  They got the approval of the - the ED.  Then I sat in the panel.  We recommended but what I want to say is that …    That - the role that I play …    I played it is governing in terms of Provision 11 of …    The procurement …    Sorry.  Of - for the Recruitment Policy …    But that policy on that provision …    It specifically say what is expected of a person …    Who it is - who it is interviewing.    The consistency with posing questions …    And all - all the things.    The - the Public Protector never made a finding on that …    But they made a finding that I …    I understand that but …    I understand that and I think we can deal with it …    Later if it needs to be dealt with.    That is correct.    Thank you.

COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes I can.     Good afternoon Chair.     That is correct Chair.     I do confirm Chair.     Yes I did.     (duly sworn, states)     Dhanajaya Gangulu Naidoo.     That is correct.     That is correct.     I do.     Yes.     Yes I am in fact a Section 204 witness with regards to the criminal cases that are still pending.     After the information that I have given to Colonel Roelofse.     Chair if I may with your permission and before we start.     There is an incident that I would like to bring or place on record before the Commission, it actually happened on Wednesday this week.     I got word that one of my close relatives their home was broken into, this might just be a random act of criminality.     Or a direct result as to maybe to send me a message to intimidate me or to deter me from testifying at this Commission Chair.     So I just wanted to place that on record.     There was a break-in, there was a home invasion Chair.     Ja.     A close relative of mine.     Yes Chair.     Chair it is due to the close proximity of my testifying at this Commission, I cannot rule out that it is maybe a concerted effort to intimidate or deter me from testifying at this hearing.     Chair at this stage I – the information that I have is very limited.     But with your permission Chair if I may suggest that the investigations into this matter be escalated to the Hawks so they can see if there is in fact a link to the robbery itself and to me testifying at this hearing.     Thank you Chair, I appreciate it.     That is correct Chair.     Yes.     That is correct.     That is correct yes.     I follow Chair.     Chair if I may with your permission there is in this timeframe of the 18 t h or rather September when I was initially interviewed by Colonel Roelofse that was just a once-off interview and then I go to the 18 t h of October 2011 to the 21 s t of October 2011, within those days there are pockets of incidents that happened during this timeframe, if I can just ...[intervenes]      The timeline for the record.     Chair this is just an overview.     I was employed in the SAPS as a member stationed at CI, Head Office, as a clerk.  During my service myself and various other members were involved in the looting of the funds from the Secret Service account.     This we did on instruction of mainly General Lazarus, together with General Mdluli, Colonel Hein Barnard.  Chair in September I was approached via General, Commissioner Henkel, General Henkel sorry.     Well it starts on the 18 t h of October 2011, up to the 21 s t of October 2011.     Chair before I go there I just want to go to September 2011, this is when I was first approached by the Hawks, more especially Colonel Roelofse, via General Henkel, he wanted and interviewed me to explain certain aspects of Crime Intelligence.  I cannot remember the exact date Chair, it was probably around the latter part of September 2011.  This interview was conducted at Crime Intelligence Head office, myself, Colonel Roelofse and General Henkel was present.  It was not a very long interview Chair, it was just more administrative to explain agent files etcetera, probably an hour or so and our meeting was done. Subsequent to that Chair in the 18 t h ...[indistinct]      Chair that was more or less to explain the agent files.   At that stage I was  handling seven agents.     It was basically administrative – I had to explain how I got to handling these agents.     Not really how the operations of it Chair, it was just more administrative because at that stage I had to explain their salaries, their medical aid payments.     So that was done in that hour long interview.     And subsequently I was asked again to meet with Colonel Roelofse, again via General Henkel, this was on the 18 t h and 19 t h of October 2011.       Chair on the 18 t h of October I met with Colonel Roelofse and Lt Colonel Piet Viljoen of the Hawks at their offices in Pretoria at Silverton.  It was regarding Crime Intelligence and the alleged looting of the account Chair.   On the first date Chair I was quite reluctant or hesitant to – not as to not to cooperate with the investigation but I had quite a lot of information that I needed to speak about, and I did not know if I could trust them at that stage Chair.     Chair if I can remember correctly on the 18 t h there were certain questions put to me by Colonel Roelofse and Lt Col Piet Viljoen which I answered honestly, I did not lie to them about anything, like I said I so much information that I did not know if I could trust them, that was the first day of the 18 t h.   However on the 20 t h, sorry the next day which is the 19 t h Chair, out of my own accord I decided to take them into my confidence and explain all of the allegations, or made numerous allegations to them regarding the looting of the secret service account.     At large Crime Intelligence Chair but it was more the Secret Service Account because this is situated within Crime Intelligence.     Yes Chair.     It was no Chair it was Colonel Roelofse and Colonel Piet Viljoen.     Yes Chair.     This  had disclosed on the 19 t h of October to the various allegations of the looting of the account, including myself, by members of Crime Intelligence, including myself.     On the same day 19 t h October 2011, sorry Chair I am just trying to get my dates in order.     Going back to the 18 t h, after my interview with – on the first day, I went back to my office and General Lazarus wanted to know what the Hawks were questioning me about.     No, that was in September Chair.     September of the same year, 2011.     That is correct Chair.     That’s correct.     Yes Chair.     Yes Chair.     During the 18 t h, I will call it the first day, although it is not the first day but because ...[intervenes]      ...of the timeframe.     If I can remember correctly there was a question put to me by the investigating team if any members of Crime Intelligence had their premises rented by Crime Intelligence and I answered honestly I explained to Colonel Roelofse that General Mdluli and General Lalla their premises were being rented by CI when – I am going back to the afternoon when I went back to my office and I explained to General Lazarus that I did concede or confirm that I have – confirmed with the Hawks that this was indeed the case, in terms of the rental of the premises for the two Generals, he was quite furious with me and asked me ...[intervenes]     Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair regarding agents that I was handling at the time.    That is correct Chair.  That was almost a day long – almost entire day Chair.    No Chair.    On the 18 t h – this was on the 18 t h October.    Where certain questions were put to me.    Regarding certain aspects of criminality within CI which I indeed answered honestly and correctly or I would say honestly.    That were put to me Chair.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes.    No Chair.  When my interview concluded for the day I am referring to the 18 t h.    There was quite a few missed calls on my phone.    And I am not sure who it was but there was a few but General Lazarus was looking for me.      Or rather wanted to speak to me.    To see how the interview went with the Hawks.    Yes Chair.  Yes Chair.    I conceded that I admitted that the two generals whom I refer to as General Mdluli and General Lala that their premises were being rented by CI and like I explained he was – was not happy.  He was quite – he was quite upset.    General Lazarus.  Yes Chair.    Chair General Lazarus was the Head of the Secret Service Account at Crime Intelligence.    At that stage I am not sure – I am not sure because General Mdluli was suspended by then.    Yes.    That would be – that would be correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    I am not sure Chair I am not sure.    I would not…    I would not say number 2.    But he would be quite – he was…    You could say that Chair he was a rank below General Mdluli he was the CFO of the Secret Service Account.    So yes you correct in saying that Chair.    He was very upset with me.    That I conceded in giving that information to the Hawks.    I explained to him Chair that it was a direct question that was put to me and I could not lie to them.  It was an official investigation and I could not lie to them.    Nevertheless that was – that conversation ended there.  I cannot really remember exactly what transpired thereafter.    Chair it was not – it was not any physical attributes.    But in how he said what he said to me that made me believe that he was upset with me.    In the manner in which he said it to me.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I am going back or rather not back I am going to the 19 t h which is the next day – 19 t h October 2011.    Chair on this day I made a decision that on my own accord I am going to reveal to the Hawks all of the allegations of …    That is correct Chair the abuse of the account by various members as most of which were senior members of Crime Intelligence including myself Chair.      Chair there was an arrangement that I would meet them over those two days which was the 18 t h.  Like I said I concluded on the 18 t h and there was regiment that I meet the next day as well.    Chair on the 19 t h – on the 19 t h October again I had to give General Lazarus feedback on how my interview went with the Hawks.  Like I said Chair at this stage I had explained or confided in them.  Going back to General Lazarus I gave him a very watered…    I gave him a watered down version of what really transpired.    Yes Chair.    That is correct Chair.  At that stage what I could – because there were so many incidents of corruption Chair.  On the 19 t h what I could remember I conceded and given them that information. But all of that…    Information that I have given to them on the 19 t h Chair.    And a little bit of the 18 t h is contained in an affidavit that I deposed to Colonel – Lieutenant Colonel Piet Viljoen on the 24 t h October 2011.    Most of that information that came out of the interview over these two days was contained in that initial investigation.  If I can call it the “blanket investigation” sorry Chair pardon me.  If I can call it the “Blanket Affidavit” that I deposed to.    Thank you.    Pardon me.  Can I get the date again?    Yes that is correct I was already in the witness protection program by then.    Yes yes.  As per the previous day I had to again give General Lazarus feedback as to how the interview went with the Hawks.  Like I explained I gave him at this stage on the 19 t h I had given them all the information that I knew at that stage.  I gave General Lazarus a watered down version of what really transpired just to get him off my back.      Chair not really but I fell within the Secret Service Account so he was indirectly my boss.  I actually reported to Colonel Barnard who reported to General Lazarus.    I cannot remember the details Chair.    But I do remember having this conversation with him on the 19 t h.    Yes Chair.  Like I mentioned on the 19 t h I decided on my own accord to give the Hawks all the information that I knew at that stage which was quite substantial many incidents that I referred to.    So I did not give him all the details – I am referring to General Lazarus my conversation with him that I had with him on the afternoon of the 19 t h I gave him a watered down version of what really transpired with my interview with the Hawks.    Chair the previous day I had only told him about one incident regarding the safe premises and he was quite upset with me.      And on the 19 t h I gave them a whole lot of information and I do not think he would have taken kindly to that.    That is correct Chair.    Chair it is some time ago.    It is almost seven years.    I would say so Chair I cannot remember the details.    No.    Ja.    Sure.  Chair if I can just go back to the overview and I will get to 63 in a moment?    Like I said on the 19 t h I had this discussion with General Lazarus.  I dropped him off at his residence and I went to my home.  The next day I picked him up as I would normally do because he travelled with me to work – to his office.  I dropped him off at his office and I explained to him that I was quite tired mentally having been interviewed by the Hawks for the previous two days and I informed him that I would want – like to go home to rest.  He agreed Chair.  After I dropped him off at his office I decided – I am talking about the 20 t h Chair the Thursday.    I decided to confide in one of my colleagues namely Colonel Barnard.    And I confided in him Chair and I told him about the interview that I had with the Hawks.  And also informed him that I also informed the Hawks that I had also conceded that I put in claims to the value of R100 000.00 – false claims.      That is correct Chair.    Chair during this – during this confession that I made to Colonel Barnard another member of Crime Intelligence that was present there I am not sure if I can mention his name?    Oh pardon me sorry.    Yes Chair.    There was another Colonel who …    I do have the number Chair.    I would refer to this Colonel as FM40.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    He was also present when I confided in Colonel Barnard.    With my admissions to the Hawks.    Chair at that stage I was – I was – I – or rather I had the impression that they were genuinely concerned about my wellbeing.    Yes Chair.    Initially they were quite shocked though with my admissions regarding the R100 000.00.    It was more the amount that I put in Chair.    And the – or rather I would the admissions Chair not so much the amount.    The admissions that I had made to the Hawks.    Regarding the amount.    And I genuinely believed Chair that they were concerned about my wellbeing and they said that I must take care of myself I must go home and have a rest.    Chair this is on the 20 t h October.    Chair which I did.  I was quite tired.  I was exhausted mentally because remember I was interviewed quite extensively the previous two days so I went home.    And I think I had a sleep for a few hours.    Pardon me Chair I did not hear that part?    Yes Chair it did.    More or less because it was quite extensive in terms of what I disclosed to Colonel Roelofse and Colonel Viljoen.    That is correct Chair.    That is correct Chair.    Chair I am still referring to the 20 t h.  The evening of the 20 t h probably between 6 or 9 I cannot be sure or more or less during that time my wife and I decided to go for a walk because like I said I was quite stressed out and also mentally tired from the previous two days.  My eldest son was at home.  He was asleep Chair.  It was my wife and I and my youngest son he was on his bicycle we went – decided to go for a walk around the block around my house.      This was in the evening Chair of the 20 t h probably between six and seven.    We went around the block Chair.  There is a park opposite my house.  We walked around the park and as I was getting closer to my house I saw two of my colleagues Colonel FM08.    Sorry Chair I – it is just…    I am just looking for the…    And FM09.    Yes Chair.    Chair I cannot remember exactly which one of them but one of them – I refer to both of them in this incident but one of them and like I said I do not know which one I cannot remember exactly.    I saw them jumping over the gate of my house the driveway gate.    Chair there was a car that was parked in front of my driveway gate which I recognised as one of the vehicles that I previously drove at CI as a covert vehicle.    It was subsequently handed to one of my colleagues FM08 at that stage was driving that particular vehicle.  So I recognised it to be the vehicle that he was driving.    That is correct Chair.  Around the block, around the park and we were on our way back nearing the house.    And I noticed one of them jumping over the fence or rather the driveway gate Chair.    In front of the gate Chair that is correct.    That is correct.  On the outside of the gate.    That is correct Chair from within the property jumping over the gate back outside. So obviously they were…    That is correct.    Chair     It was my eldest son he was asleep Chair at the time.    And my youngest son accompanied us on his bicycle.    My wife walked and he came on his bicycle.    Chair like I said as I was nearing the premises I noticed this – one of my colleagues jump over the fence and they got into the vehicle Chair that was parked in front of the driveway gate and they started the car – sorry Chair.    And they started to drive in my direction which was not very far off from my house.    As the car approached or came nearby I noticed General Lazarus sitting in the front seat.    The car stopped and he told me I am a very hard man to get hold of.      General Lazarus.     And I explained to him I just went for a walk around the block.  So he asked me to jump into the car.    He offered my wife a lift home and I explained to him that it was just around the corner so I gave her the house key and she continued together with my son they went back home.  I jumped into the car Chair.    No.       He basically instructed me to jump into the car.    This was between 6 and 7 in the evening Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Like I said General Lazarus was in the front passenger seat.    FM08 was driving the car Chair.    FM09 was sitting in the backseat on the left side.    And I jumped into the right side of that – behind the driver’s seat.    And when I jumped in FM08 who was driving the vehicle started to drive around the block.  If I can remember correctly General Lazarus enquired from me if I was okay and I said no I was indeed okay.  He subsequently asked me if there is anything I want to tell him.  I said no.  I think if I can remember correctly he asked me the question again.  And I said no.  Chair.    Chair if – just bear with me Chair I…    Sorry it is a few years now I am just trying to …    [Indistinct] my thoughts together.    Yes.    Yes okay that is fine.  Chair I am also trying to just remember the events but I will – I will refer to the different pages.    Just to refresh my memory as well.    Yes Chair.  Like I said General Lazarus there asked me you do not want to tell me anything. That was his exact words to me.  If I can remember or according to my statement and I said that I did not.  General Lazarus then said he heard that I had made some admissions to the Hawks. Chair I said that he - he got it wrong and then he asked me then why is Colonel Barnard saying that you are - you - you admitted to putting in false claims to the value of R100 000,00.    Chair at that stage I admitted to - to speaking to - to - I am talking about General Lazarus now.  I admitted to him that I or rather I - I said that I - I admitted to - to speaking to Colonel Barnard but the night that I - I told Colonel Barnard that I put in false claims or admitted to him putting in false claims.   Thereafter Chair General Lazarus then told me that he had spoken to a certain pastor - Pastor Jonathan.  Chair this pastor was an associate of Mr Marimuthu which I will deal with further or later in my statement or (intervenes).    Mr Panganathan - to me - Marimuthu.    And that this whole thing would be over soon and I must be strong.  So …    Pastor Jonathan.    Ja.    He - that is correct Chair.    And that I must be strong.    So what I understood from this - from what General Lazarus told me is when he said that I understood that I must be strong through this investigation.  That it will be over soon.    Chair, I - I managed or I - I think I managed to stay calm and …    I - I was convinced that I had convinced him that I did not speak or I did not make any such admissions.    So while this whole conversation was taking place we had circled the block around the park near my house and we came to close my house again and FM08 drove into the driveway.    Chair before I could get out of the car General Lazarus told him to reverse and to carry on driving …    And from there we proceeded to General Lazarus’ house in Isandovale in Edenvale which is not very far from - from my own house.    Chair as we were all getting out of the car and I am referring to all.  It is myself, General Lazarus, FM …    08 and FM09.    FM10 also arrived at General Lazarus’ house …    And we all proceeded or proceeded to the braai area.    The braai area - the braai area of the house.    That is correct Chair.    Chair at this stage there was just general conversation.  I cannot remember the details of it but I like I say it was general conversation.  Up to a stage that FM10 made a statement that his contact at the Hawks had informed him that I had made certain admissions to them and that I am now on the side of the Hawks.    Chair I again had to go into defence mode.  I again denied what was being said.    Chair and at this stage I started to feel uncomfortable …    As more questions were being directed to me regarding my involvement in the admission of putting in false claims to the Hawks.    Nevertheless Chair I still managed to stay calm …    But although - although still remaining calm I was uncomfortable.    Chair - pardon me Chair.  Like I said there was general conversation up to a point where Westville Air Travels - Air Travel Tickets were discussed …    And Colonel FM08 said that General Hankel had requested certain documentation from him regarding air tickets.  Colonel FM10 then told Colonel FM08 that he must speak to his contact.  Contact referring to the contact at Westville Air Travel.  This particular individual I - I know as Mahesh.  I am - I am not sure what is his surname Chair.    And that they must destroy the evidence of the air tickets.    Chair, F - FM08 said that General Hankel was making certain inquiries regarding air tickets …   From this particular service provider namely Westville Air Travel.    FM10 told FM08 that he must speak to his contact at the travel agent and that they must destroy all of the - the invoices or related matters …    Regarding the travel.  More especially to - to Crime Intelligence.    Chair, I forgot to mention or I did mention FM09 was also part of this.   Chair when this suggestion was made by FM - FM10 to FM08 all - all who were present at the braai area was agreement - was in agreement with the suggestion.  No one disagreed.   Chair what I can remember next FM08 said that he will speak to his contact whom I referred to previously as Mahesh.  He worked off a laptop.    I think it is    I think it would be M-A-H-E-S-H Chair.    Like I say I am - I am not too sure what his surname was.    FM08 said that he would speak to Mahesh as he worked off a laptop and he would speak to him to ensure that the laptop was either destroyed or damaged so the evidence would be lost.    Chair I was later given to understand this was apparently not done in time as - I am not sure.  Pardon me Chair.    Chair this was apparently not done in time because I was later informed that the investigators did manage to - to obtain certain records from - from Mahesh prior to - to him destroying …    The records.    Chair if I may just go to the next incident that is still happened at the braai area.   After this - this conversation took place regarding the - the destruction of the evidence …    Relating to the air tickets FM09 asked General Lazarus if he should spin a story.    General Lazarus did not say anything but he nodded his head.    This made me believe that he had agreed with what FM09 had suggested.    Chair I cannot remember the details thereafter.  I am taking about the braai area.  If there was any more talk or it was just general conversation …    But what I can say is after - after we had finished at General Lazarus’ house …    FM09 suggested that he, FM08 and I go for a drink.    That is perfect Chair.  Thank you.    Thank you Chair.
