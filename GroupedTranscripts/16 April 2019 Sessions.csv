CHAIRPERSON:  Good Morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.     Thank you.  I am going to deliver my decision in the application brought by Mr Moyane for leave to cross -examine Mr Gordhan.  It will not be immediately or a typed version will not be immediately available but it will be available in the n ext few days.  So – but otherwise it will be subject to one qualification a full decision.     Thank you.    Yes you may be seated thank you.  This is an application brought by Mr Thomas Swabihi Moyane for leave to cross -examine Mr P J Gordhan the Minister of Public En terprises who submitted a statement in this commission last year and subsequently gave evidence.  I shall refer to Mr Moyane as the applicant.  A copy of Mr Gordhan’s statement was sent to the applicant by the secretary of the commission in accordance with  Rule 3.3 of the Rules of this commission.  A notice contemplated in Rule 3.3 was also sent to the applicant.  In support of his application the applicant delivered a founding affidavit with extensive annexures as well as a supplementary affidavit also with annexures.  Mr Gordhan opposes the applicant’s application in support of his opposition.  Mr Gordhan delivered an 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  opposing affidavit with extensive annexures as well.  Thereafter the applicant delivered a short replying affidavit with annexures. In due course the applicant’s counsel and Mr Gordhan’s counsel delivered written submissions on the applicant’s application for leave to cross -examine and Mr Gordhan’s opposition thereof.  I subsequently had oral argument presented by counsel for the applicant Mr Mpofu SC counsel for Mr Gordhan Ms Le Roux and some limited comments by the head of the commission’s legal team Mr Pretorius SC.  I am indebted to all counsel for their written and oral argument.  After hearing argument I reserved my decision and indicated  that I would announce it due course.  Subject to one qualification that I will deal with later this is my decision.  In order to proper consider the applicant’s application it is necessary to first refer to the legal framework within which an application for leave to cross-examine a witness before this commission must be evaluated in order to decide whether leave should be granted or refused.   The legal Framework  This commission was appointed in terms of Section 84 of The Constitution.  The Commissions Ac t has been made applicable to it.  Certain regulations have been promulgated that apply to it.  Neither the Constitution nor the Commissions Act contains any express provision relating to the cross -examination of witnesses by anybody adversely affected by any statements or evidence of a witness in a judicial commission of inquiry such as this one.  However Regulation 83 of the    I think we will need to take the  tea adjournment now.    And then we can proceed after that.  It is eleven o’clock, we will adjourn and resume at quarter past eleven.     Those who might not have been here earlier on good morning to everybody.  Thank you.    Yes Mr Pretorius.    I am sorry.  Just to go back to impersonation.  As you understand it what was the factual basis of the charge that they were impersonating IPID Officials?  Were they wearing any uniform that IPID Officials wear?  Were they alleged to have said they were IPID Officials as you understand the position?     The ones on the basis of which the charges had been put together of impersonating?     Oh, yes okay.    Ja.    Ja.    Hm.    Hm.    So they could not remember well?     Hm.    Thank you.    Mine is blank too.    One second Mr Pretorius.  Thank you.  You may proceed.     And do you think the motive or aim was to drive you out of IPID or at least to deter you from any determination you might have had to fight corruption with the vigour that you might have displayed before, to try and slow you down and soften you.  Do you think it’s either of the tw o that they might have wanted to achieve with you in particular?    Is that to keep you away from your work?     And of course was it in the conversation that was recording it yesterday where there was talk of if you do this we will remember you or we won’t forget you, or so and so won’t forget you, so that’s part of what you’re talking about?     Ja and if you want to be remembered you need to be pliant, you need to keep that person happy so they can remember you.    And being arrested.    And obviously if you have that culture in any organisation but talking about SAPS now if that is the position then it’s very easy for those members of SAPS who are quite happy to be pliant to the seniors to be actually pliant to outsiders as well.     So private companies, individuals, you know criminal 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  syndicates because there would be – I mean the seniors would offer them either money that they might be getting illegally or offer them positions that will give them money, high positions, so people outside can give them money and then they would be happy, that’s why they would be wanting if they  see the position.    That’s their core function. 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84     Thank you.  Mr Pretorius I just want us to take five minutes break, we will adjourn for five minutes, and we will resume in five minutes, twenty five to.    Okay you may proceed Mr Pretorius.    Yes.    Yes.    And…    And the – there would still be many of those?     I guess that has to be acknowl edged.    Hm, hm.    The harassment that you have been talking about is primarily aimed at IPID – IPID or is – I know that maybe some of the Law Enforcement Agencies that may – that are supposed to fight corruption might not have been seen to be very effective in the past.So maybe they might not have been targeted.  But what is your experience?  Is it this kind of harassment from SAP S and Crime Intelligence being directed at just really primarily IPID?     Yes.    Ja thank you.    Yes.    Yes it is one o’clock we  will take the lunch adjournment and resume at two.  We adjourn.     You may proceed Mr Pretorius.    [Intervenes].    Reference group being a reference to what appears to have been an advisory kind of group of people  put together by the then Minister Nhleko?    Okay.    You just said about a few minutes ago in relation to I think Mr [indistinct] he is the one who was prosecuting in your cases?     Yes you just said that he was prosecuting on the basis of the Werksmans Report only, but I am – my recollection is that when we spoke yesterday or was it Friday that you said you never got to know whether there were any statements in the docket or not.  Is that right?    You asked for statements – witness statements, you were not give or you were refused but you never got to know whether they were there or they were never there.  I thought that is what you said.    But is the difficulty not – I know that Mr Pretorius is on something else but is the difficulty not with saying that a bout him and his report that you have got to ask where was the factual basis for his conclusion that there should be a criminal prosecution then because if the factual – if there was a factual basis based on witness statements on the – on which his recommendations were based then at least those statements should have been available to the prosecution.     So that even if his report was taken away those statements should have remained there whi ch of course might go towards what you are saying that maybe in all probabilities that the report was the only thing but it would really be most surprising if both the police and prosecutor who would put people, comments, criminal proceedings against someb ody with no witness statements.  Ja, okay.  Thanks so.    I did not hear who – I am sorry.  I did not hear who it was that you were going to address or Sesoko and Khuba we re going to address.    Oh, okay.    Who was who at the time?     Okay.    How long ago was this?  It was March, the 31 s t 2016?    Hm.    Is it with the NPA?     And it has been there for how long?  Since when?     Oh.    Hm.    2017?    Oh, okay.     I thought when we were listening to the recording yesterday, the other person was not from IPID I thought he was from Crime Intelligence, I may have misunderstood.      Oh okay.     You were raising, among others, this issue?   Exhibit Y?    Okay let’s try again, Exhibit Y?     Okay, I think your junior is laughing at you.     So, okay the page is 1765.    So the whole thing of this person’s employment started while you were on suspension and Mr Ngamanyana was the acting Executive Director?      And when you arrived he was already working in the ministry but on the books was it reflected under IPID as an employee official or whatever or do you know where he was reflected as?      Yes, no, no that’s the most important question, how come he had anything to do i n terms of paperwork with IPID if he was going – he was not going to be employed by IPID and if he was not employed by IPID and I take it that you never got any explanation from Mr Ngamanyana because you said he left and he never came back when you returned.    And nobody ever gave you an answer to the question from the Department of Police Ministry or anybody, you never got any answer?     So – but when it is other people those matters are not given to that unit?    That is – you did not accept that explanation and informed him or you did not accept and you left it at that?     Well it is quite concerning if a matter – if matters and it looks like many matters  in respect of which the NPA had already taken a decision to prosecute wait for five years and more without being enrolled again.  In the meantime witnesses could disappear, could pass on.  It is quite concerning.     Ja.    Ja.    So you saying a document that is in one of the exhibits that already exist?     Ja.    Okay.    No thank you very much Mr McBride once again for 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  coming forward to assist the commission and to assist the country.      I am grateful that you still have more informa tion that you want to share with the commission that will be that you regard as useful and helpful for the commission’s work.  And so I – you will – we will be seeing you again.    And it may be that quite apart from you coming back to give us more information there may well be implicated persons who might apply to for leave to cross -examine.  I am happy that you – you will always be there to assist whenever you can.     Thank you very much once again for coming forward we appreciate it and you are excused.     Thank you.      Yes, yes.ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC    Okay.    Ja.    On the [indistinct].    Ja, ja.  We – I think we will – we should resume on the 2 n d but I think we will announce before we break in case there should be a change but there should not – I do not think there should be a change about the 2 n d.      Oh is there a need?  Or is there a need to hav e certainty now?    Okay then…    Then 2 n d we will be here.    Ja.    So tomorrow we can start at normal time ten o’clock?     Ten o’clock ja.  Okay we will then adjourn for the day and tomorrow we will start at ten.    We adjourn. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.    Thank you Chair.  The legal representatives of Mr Moyane are present and the legal representative of Mr Gordhan have asked to be excused.    May I be seat during…    Alright now we are going to come to that in a moment. If we could just complete the references in 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  the transcript and go to page 1566.  At the top of the page the English    Your references to this transcript insofar as we are able.  This is a transcript of a telephone conversation of an uncertain date between a Mr Mahlangu an I PID investigator and Mr Gomo a senior officer in Crime Intelligence, correct?     And you say that the Auditor General had noticed this issue?     What happened as a result of your investigations into these facts or allegations?  Were there any disciplinary proceedings?     Alright.  Let us move on then to the counter investigation that we flagged earlier in your evidence.  At paragraph 80 you deal with the investigation conducted by IPID into the then acting National Commissioner of Police General Phahlane.     Please briefly provide the background to that investigation?     Sorry before you go on.  At that time was Mr Gomo part of IPID?     Yes.  In any event you say there was a complaint laid with IPID about the conduct of General Phahlane?     In broad terms how would you – how would one categorise those complaints?     Was that case then brought to your attention?    Alright. You do mention the duplicate files being closed in the same paragraph where you talk about O’Sullivan’s complaint but you say they are separate in time?     That is brought to your acting 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  predecessor Mr Kgamanyane?     Or acting National Commissioner Phahlane on the one hand and the list of persons who are the subject matter of the collection of evidence and potential charges on page 1565 at the top of the page.    Funded by whom allegedly?     Right.  So now we have a task team investigating General Phahlane and we have the complainant.     You say that report went missing?    You talk of a second charge of 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  defeating the ends of justice that was registered against the Mabula Team and other Generals?     It is all very complicated.    But essentially what we have as I understand your evidence is an investigation into General  Phahlane, an investigation now into other Generals particularly from the North West and a counter investigation for security breach and the like and the execution of the search warrant in related matters.  Am I correct?     Alright.  Let us go then to paragraph 90.  What happened during the course of the investigation and counter investigation?     Right and if you would have regard to paragraphs 90 and then 91 please and tell the Chair of what you say there.    So as part of the execution of the search warrant O’Sullivan and his attorney accompanied IPID investigators.  Is that correct or not?     Ja, but is it correct that O’Sullivan and Trent accompanied IPID investigators to the Sable Hills premises or estate rather, rather than the [intervenes]?     Okay.  I understand and on the basis, is it on the basis of O’Sullivan and Trent accompanying the IPID Officials that there were charged with impersonation of IPID Officials?     Right and this was part of the investigation in relation to the complaint?     Made by O’Sullivan.  Is that 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  right?    Were O’Sullivan and Trent arrested?    You mention in paragraph 92 an incident that occurred during the course of that arrest.  What is that?     So against the backgrou nd of the information and the telephone conversation transcript?     You have Khomo talking to Mahlangu one of the task team members investigating Phahlane?     About giving evidence against other members of the task team about collating or obtaining evidence and the like.  The precise wording used is “instructive” but we can deal with that when Mr Mahlangu is called if he comes to testify.  So w hat you have basically is an investigation into General  Phahlane and what you have referred to as a counter investigation?     That issue was taken to court?     And was dealt with by His Lordship Mr Justice Tuchten?    In the annexures to your original statement and the original annexures there are at leas t part of the judgment of His Lordship Justice  Tuchten, but it is incomplete.  So we have obtained a proper copy of the judgment together with the order granted.  It is EXHIBIT Y2 Chair and it has been handed to your 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  Registrar.    I am not going to go into it in any detail but just to highlight certain aspects of the judgment and order.  If you would just look at page 1 of EXHIBIT Y2.  Is that the matter where IPID is the first applicant, you are the seco nd applicant, Mahlangu is the third applicant?     And Binang another member of the Task Team is the fourth applicant?     Were they to some extent or another involved in the counter investigation ag ainst IPID and others or members of IPID and O’Sullivan as well?     There is a related matter.    That obviously was joined involving others as well?    Form the background to this application before His Lordship Mr Justice Tuchten?    They are an IPID investigation into General Phahlane and an IPID investigation into General  Mabula.    General Mabula and others now come to Gauteng to conduct what we call the counter investigation?     All these events are relevant to the transcript of the telephone conversation that you have spoken about and about which there may be further evidence?     Okay.  Can we go to page 12 of EXHIBIT Y2 please?  After obviously hearing the parties the Judge    Paragraph 25 reads   And the first respondent there agreed not to take part in the investigation?     That is the counter investigation to which you refer?    And a further draft order appears at page 24 of EXHIBIT Y2.     Where an undertaking was given by Deputy National Commissioner Lieutenant -General Mfazi in the capacity of the Acting National Commissioner that certain members would be removed from the counter investigation and those persons are Major General Mabula, Brigadier Ncube, Lieutenant Colonel Dawood, Brigadier Kgorane and Colonel Reddy.  You see that on page 24?   No I am just talking – I am referring to page 24.  Are you saying that – if you go to page 26 that is the completion as I understand it, paragraph 4 of that draft order there on page 24?  So you can ignore page 25.     The undertakings were made by the respondents – we should place on record – without any concession or admission of liability but the net effect of the application was the removal of certain interested perso ns in the counter investigation.    To provide for a similar 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  [intervenes]?    Right.  In paragraph 94 you continue your evidence in relation to the counter investigation?     This would have been – I just want to check its relationship in time to the application to court before Judge Tuchten.  Before that application the events which occurred in paragraph 94 would have occurred.  Is that correct o r not?    You see what you say in paragraph 94?  If you could have regard to it please.     In relation to the application before Judge Tuchten.    So before the Tuchten judgment the events in paragraph 94 occur?     And were probably relevant to the need I understand for the bringing of the application at all?     What happened in May  2017?    Just to remind the Chair Mahlangu and Binang were part of the Task Team set up by yourself to investigate Phahlane?    Right and were certain other accused or alleged accused joined to that proceedings?     Right.    The incident you referred to in paragraph 95 before you testify to that is that of your knowledge or is that information received by you?     What is the information received 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  by you?    [Intervenes] the subject of our own investigation?    In paragraph 96 you talk of charges being brought against Mahlangu and Binang who were  members of the IPID Task Team?     Is that the same occurrence that you talk about in paragraph 94?     Alright.    You referred earlier in your evidence to an occurrence that is or was not uncommon in relation to people in your position that you would be charged and charged again and charged again?    After the charges and the rendition saga how many times after that were you ever charged with any offence?    Okay.    Right.    On what basis were charges contemplated in relation to yourself of racketeering?  Do you know?     And what was the purpose then of approaching the high court?   From page 24 to page 27 you deal with circumstances giving rise to and the bringing of the application in the North Gauteng high court which was heard by His Lordship Mr Justice Tuchten.  You have dealt with that.  If you could assist the court – or assist the Chair rather by looking at paragraphs 1 to 118 to see if there is anything further that you want to say  in relation to those events about which you have testified this morning?     Right.  Just before you go on it seems that amongst the cases that IPID was investigating against amongst others General Mabula in the North West.     Concerned torture and a death and detention?    Later?    Alright but let us just deal with the sequence then in paragraph 109.  You say the – despite obtaining an order from Prinsloo J, what was the nature of the order obtained from Prinsloo J?    Counter investigations?     Investigations who had an interest in the outcome of that investigation?     I just tried to find the Prinsloo judgment I cannot.    On two occasions IPID finds it’s necessary to approach the courts for one or other form of interdict?     These come before Judge Prinsloo and Judge Tuchten?     Alright.    In paragraph 110 you say   Thank you Chair.  Mr  McBride can we go to page 26 please at p aragraph 116 of your statement?  You there deal with the circumstances of the application before Judge Tuchten?    You say that in relation to that    And you say in paragraph 117 that the term “revenge investigation” was made by Judge  Tuchten in his judgment on 26 June 2018.  The order was in effect drafted around Section 25 of the IPID Act and you explain that it is that Act that precludes IPID members from investigating matters where there is a conflict of interest?    [Intervenes] as a declaration of that conflict of interest?    And the Judge noted that the SAPS Act did not have a similar clause?     And it was advised or even directed that SAPS should look into that matter?     Right.  In paragraph 119 you deal with the search and seizure related to a vehicle investigation related in turn to General Phahlane.  Would you tell the court briefly about that?    Between whom?    Relationship between who?     Is that the same Keating that you referred to earlier?     Criminal Analytics?    A car being made available in South Africa?    So you say that - as I understand it – IPID was investigating a money laundering operation?     Which was used to facilitate the provision of motor vehicles in South Africa but the money originated from SAPS itself?    FDA being?    Anyway as you say that these matters were the subject of investigation?    [Intervenes].    Alright.    Right.  You say that search warrants were issued in relation to these investigations?     What happened to the search warrants?    Was that challenge suc cessful?    At page 28 of your statement at paragraph 123 you made the general point that IPID has been under attack and continues to be under attack.  Is that correct?     Or I should qualify that.  Yo u say    But if you have or if you are confident to make allegations we will not intervene, but just caution that you should be conscience of that fact.     These are police officials that are not prosecuted? 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84     Came back to IPID? 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84     Perhaps we will refer to some correspondence as an example of the exchange between IPID under your watch and the NDPP under the watch of Advocate  Abrahams but in your statement apart from the examples that you have given you talk of prosecutions that did take place and you contrast those with prosecutions that did not take place.     What is your comment there?     Yes, perhaps that should be the topic of further investigations on the part of the investigation team of the Commission to see if your allegations are borne out.     By that analysis.    Is there anything else you wish to add then on the National Prosecuting Authority before we go to page 30 of your statement?    On page 30 you deal with the firm of attorneys Hogan Lovells again before you deal with it, may I just highlight a distinction between a firm of attorneys being used and a firm of attorneys deliberately being part o f the clients cause.  On the fact of it there’s nothing wrong with anybody using any firm of attorneys and you do so – Hogan Lovells allowed itself to be used so bearing that in mind what point do you make in paragraph 131?      And then paragraph 132, you talk about the CATS unit, the Crimes Against The State Unit, would you tell the Chair about that unit please and how you regarded its activities?     Is there any relationship, to your knowledge between the Priority Crimes Litigation Unit which operates under the auspices of the NPA and the CATS or the Crimes Against the State Unit which op erates under the Hawks or the DPCI?  You deal with an issue on page 31 paragraph 134.      Alright at paragraph 135 you deal with Police Minister Nglego as Chief of Staff.      Page 1765, it’s YD.      The paper trail you refer to there, I’m not sure if you feel it necessary to show it to the Chair, the contents of that paper trail, I’ll leave it up to you from page 1765 onwards it just shows that a query was raised by your acting predecessor.     Well perhaps we should just refer briefly to the correspondence at page 1765 is a letter from the Acting Executive Director of IPID Mr Ngamanaya dated 22 February 16 to a Mr Dlodlo it requests a personnel suitability check or a security check as you put it in relation to Leon  Mbangwa do you see that?     And you say that, “it has come to the attention of the Executive Director of IPID that the Chief of Staff of the Minister of Police is a Zimbabwean, he’s a convicted fraudster, he was convicted and sentenced for providing  a false ID, he continues to use this false ID, for some unexplained reason the request for pre -16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  employment screening was done via IPID in my absence”, which is the point that you’ve emphasises, “whilst the results of the pre -employment screening by your domestic branch was able to detect that the subject had a criminal record and had financial problems, it was unable to detect that the ID was false and that the subject is a Zimbabwean” and you then attach to that letter supporting documentation.  Is that th e paper trail you referred to?     So you had made reports in accordance with your investigations and duties to the NDPP, you say that some action was taken but they were not finalised over a long period of time.        You reach your conclusion at 1763, you’re free to mention, in summary, any particular case that we might not have dealt with in evidence but I would like you to put your conclusion on record at 1763 please.     There is an intervening letter from yourself again dated 23 F ebruary 2018 but before we go there we should have regard to the letter received by you on 19 February 2018 addressed to you by the NDPP, Advocate Abrahams and signed by him on 19 December 2017.  What does he say in response to your various communications of which we have referred to but one?     Yes I think the point you making is that in relation to all the matters that had been outstanding for a long period of time he deals with them in the way he does but in relation to the swiftness with which you and others were d ealt with he says well special resources and efficient resources were dedicated to that 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  prosecution?    But you say later in his position of advisor on the Reference Group reporting to the Minister.   Is there anything else that you wish to mention at this stage?     And to continue for at least two hours on Thursday when we then break for the Easter break.   With your leave Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Noted, thank you Chair.    Yes Chair.    Thank you Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS  INQUIRY RESUMES    Morning again Chair.      Thank you Chair.  Before th e adjournment yesterday Mr McBride we were dealing with the transcript of the telephone conversation at page 1557 of the bundles which is Yd.  We had got to page 1564 and we were discussing the list of persons at the top of page 1565 who were at the very l east subject matter of an investigation.  Do you see that list of persons at 1565?     That list would have included Mr Mahlangu one of the speakers on the transcript as well as yourself as  ED?    Executive Director.    Now you going to tell the Chair in a moment hopefully in a moment of the – of the investigation conducted by IPID into certain police officers and of what is referred to as a counter investigation by those police officers or persons associated with them into IPID and we will deal with that.  That matter eventually came before His L ordship Mr Justice Touchton who dealt with the result and dispute in matters arising from the investigation and the counter investigation.    So we will explain the origins of that list of names in due course but it – what you have already told the Chair is that the context of all this is what you described as at least a questionable counter investigation by police into IPID investigators.     Alright well let us just summarise.    The first part of the conversation deals with what is in effect an offer or a prospect of a substanti al promotion to Colonel in Criminal Intelligence – in Crime Intelligence.    Correct?    There is then a brief reference to a fear that this might constitute favouritism or corruption and those issues are dealt with.  There is then a discussion on evidence in relation to a criminal investigation where Mr Mahlangu might be an accused?    And he is clearly speaking to Mr Gomo about bringing evidence against his co -accused?    And you say this is the counter investigation?    In that context you are said to be going down?    Right and then finally we see indications which Mr Mahlangu will explain or sugg estions of finding evidence?    In pursuance of what is being discussed.  If we can move on then to paragraph 79 of your statement.  You have told the Chair already in another paragr aph about your discovery when you returned after your suspension that cases being investigated by IPID had been prematurely closed without carrying out proper procedures and this was done in certain instances you say to manipulate the statistics upwards?     Right.  You have already told the Chair that this was intended to portray an impression that performance had been better under your replacement on an acting basis Mr Kgagmanyane – Kgamanyane better performance than under your watch?    Alright.  Do I understand you correctly one employee was dismissed and another employee resigned and there were others who were also subject to investigation in relation to these issues?    Of in effect falsifying statistics by closing cases prematurely and improperly?     Yes he was appointed in August 15.    Right.    You deal with that in paragraph 80.    Okay.    That was brought to the attention of Mr Kgamanyane during your  suspension?    As I understand it.    Is that when you discovered the – that two files had been opened and both of them had been closed on account of the fact that they were duplicates of one another?  You mentioned that in paragraph 81?     In any event…     As a result of the complaints laid by O’Sullivan and as a result of the matter again being brought to your attention was a task team established?     When was the task team established in relation to your suspension and return?  You deal with that in paragraph 82.    What year?    Are you back by this stage?     Alright.  So there is a complaint about corruption or corrupt relationships.     Alleged between General Phahlane and service providers?     On your return you receive a com – further complaint by Paul O’Sullivan that these matters have not been attended to?    A task team is established?     Okay who were members of that task team?    Alright was Mr Mahlangu part of this task team?     Right.  Who else was on the task team?    Now if you would go back to page 1565 please.  This is the transcript of the telephone conversation.      It seems that there is some co-incidence between the members of the task team that you refer to in paragraph 82 who are now investigating General Phahlane.     Nkabinde, Binang and Mahlangu are mentioned there?    So what is the link? 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84     Right.  So what appears to be happening on the face of it and there will be further evidence to deal with this and place it into full context with further facts is that Mahlangu is approached with an offer of promotion or the prospect of promotion.    To testify against a range of people some or all of whom or some of whom are members of the task team investigating General Phahlane?     And that I understand from your evidence which you are going to give to the Chair now is part of what was termed a counter investigation?     Right.    Right.  What was – in paragraph 83 you deal with the subject matter and this is relevant to the counter investigation of some of the investigation against General Phahlane.   What was that subject matter?     Right.    During January of 2017 as a search warrant issued and executed a t the home of General Phahlane?     Right.  Was that search warrant then the subject matter of a civil suit?     Right.  This – would you refer to the testimony then of one of the original task team members that is the task team to investigate General Phahlane?     Also one of the persons on the list.    In the telephone conversation transcript.    What happened in regard to 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  him?    Alright.  Thank you.  Would you go to paragraph 87 please?      And just tell the Chair what you say in that paragraph please?     Right.    What you referred to as the Sable Hills house is that the same house in respect of which the search warrant you referred to earlier was granted?     And executed?    As Paul O’Sullivan?    And to an extent at least his attorney Ms Trent?    Right.  What happens then?     And you deal with that in paragraph 88 if you would refer to it please?     Let’s just summarise then at a general level, arising out of the rendition series of events.    You were charged.        The charges came to nought.     You returned after suspension and you continued investigations or IPID under your watch continued investigations into senior police officials?      Further charges both in relation to the counter investigation and other matters were contemplated at least, or prepared against you?      Thank you Chair. INQUIRY ADJOURNS  INQUIRY RESUMES     Thank you Chair.  The counter investigation what was the outcome of that?  You deal with that in paragraph 97.      2017?    That deals with undue delays?     Was it in fact struck off the role  by the relevant magistrate?   And apparently could only be re-enrolled with a written instruction of the National Director of Public Prosecutions?    Briefly tell the court of the Prinsloo application.  Judge Prinsloo application or the application heard by Judge Prinsloo and I understand that that application preceded the application that you have referre d to before Judge Tuchten?    That you say in paragraph 99 that he would arrest other members of the task team including yourself?     This is the Judge Prinsloo application.    And the outcome of the – it is in the bundle but I want to try and avoid referring to it in any detail but we can refer to it?    That was an application brought by the Helen Suzman Foundation, is that right or is that a different application?    Alright we will see if we can find a reference to that.    There is another judgment in the bundle by Judge Prinsloo which we will not deal with n ow.  If you look please at page 24 of your statement – of your statement?      And these are the cases that were described as “cold cases”?     So…    As I understand it the – the undertakings not to con tinue with the investigation by those people were not obeyed which resulted in further application being necessary and that came before Prinsloo J.  Is that – am I understanding you correctly? 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84     You said Prinsloo J18.  Let us get the sequence right.  You said 2018 for Prinsloo?     And then Tuchten?    Alright that is the order.    Alright.  But the reasoning – the reason for the second is what you have said?     And they – they covered the same subject matter?    Or having certain people 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  involved in counter investigations.     It relates to another matter.    So I am not sure we have the correct one on file but we will attempt to do that.  But because you have dealt with the facts giving rise to the judgment by Tuchten J the same principles as I understand it are involved?     You say in paragraph 109   Right.  And you talk about the warning statements there.    Mr McBride just to deal with page 24 to 27 of your statement in an attempt to summarise the evidence you have given to invite you to make any further comment.  On your return to IPID after your suspension investigations into very senior police officials including acting commissioner continued.  There are counter investigations to which you have referred.   Those counter investigations involve the very IPID members conducting sensitive investigations.    We have referred to the Tuchten judgment and we will try to find the Prinsloo judgment.  I think the wrong one may have been filed.  Nevertheless you say notwithstanding the order obtained before Judge Prinsloo the investigations and as you talk – as you describe it harassment of the IPID investigators continued?    Yes.  I would like to refer then    “Continued with their counter investigation against the IPID.  Mabula and his team continued harassing and attempting to intimidate IPID members to impede the IPID investigation into Phahlane.”  Is that your evidence?    [Indistinct]     “Was sanctioned at a senior level.”  What I want to ask is you in relation to your evidence on page 26 is whether apart from the court applications attempts were made by approaching people in high office to try and address what was happening?    Perhaps we should take the long adjournment now Chair.    And when we come back Mr McBride we will deal with a summary of the aspect that you are dealing with now the counter investigation and then move onto page 27 hopefully we can finish this afternoon.      Well there’s nothing wrong with respect to your evidence to brief counsel repeatedly, in fact, it might sometimes advantage a client because that person then has knowledge and experience and is relied upon to use that knowledge and experience in a clients cause, in fact it’s the duty of the legal profession to act in the cause of the client.      Alright is there anything else you wish to add to paragraph 131?    Tell the Chair what you wish to say about that please?        And explain, please, to the Chair the point that you wish to make in paragraphs 135 to 136 and 137 in fact.     Alright perhaps you can go to Annexure X to the – to Exhibit Y at page 1765.     It’s Exhibit X of – well it’s Annexure X to Exhibit Y, let me just refer to the page Chair, page 1765.      Well she sent me the note, so she’s entirely responsible.     The answer to that request for a check appears at page 1767 and it says in summary, “no negative information of National security relevance was obtained with regard to the above candidate, the candidate is a confirmed South African citizen, the candidate has a criminal record, the candidate has a negative credit record, it should be noted that the inability of a person to manage his/her finances could pose a security che ck” and then you take up the (indistinct) on page 1770 after your return and you do so in a letter of 25 October 2016 where you address a letter to Mr Arthur Fraser of the State Security Agency, do you see that?      Before we deal with your evidence on page 32 can we go back to paragraph 128 please.  You refer in that paragraph to correspondence between yourself in your position as Executive Director of IPID and advocate Shaun Abrahams of  the NDPP and perhaps we just ought to place that correspondence on record.  Annexure U to which you refer is at page 1742 of Exhibit YD.      Now the sequence – you refer to U, V and W the sequence may be incorrect in the Annexures to your 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  statement, let’s just check that. Perhaps you can explain at page 1743 is a letter addressed to you in your capacity as Executive Director of IPID and its dated the 19 t h of December 2017, that’s the date  of its signature, do you see that, it’s marked as having been received on the 19 t h of February 2018 and it refers to correspondence from yourself addressed to the NPA during 2017. How does that relate to the letter at 1749 and at 1753, it seems that we’ve  got to begin at the end of the sequence of correspondence at 1754, the letter of 2 May 2017, is that correct?     Right would you tell the Chair briefly and in summary, because you’ve de alt with much of the contents of this in evidence what you were addressing to the NDPP and the purpose of your letter please?      Let’s start with the one of 2 May 17, that’s the first in this chain, what was the purpose of you addressing Advocate Abrahams of NDPP or the NDPP rather?      It seems that what you say to Advocate Abrahams is that IPID has investigated a number of cases against senior police officials.    That the files have been delivered to the NPA but there has been no action in relation to the matters referred to the NDPP is that correct?      Right so they had not been prosecuted to finality?      And that was your complaint?      On page – you then in the long letter beginning at 1754 refer to a number of individual cases some of which you’ve testified to now in evidence.      Is that correct?    That is correct.    And he deals with various investigations and matters reported by IPID to the NDPP?     Including the matter involving General Phahlane, the matter involving Executive Director General Kgamanyane, the Mabula team, Brigadier Ncuba and he says that the decision has been taken not to prosecute and he gives his reasons for that.  Do you have any comment?     Yes.  I have not referred to the letter addressed to Advocate Abrahams on the 23 February 2018 which appears at page 1749 and following.  It is marked confidential I am not sure that that would preclude us dealing with it unless you have any reason not to deal with it.  But in a nutshell and I do not think th at we need the letter to establish that you did not accept Advocate Abrahams explanations, is that correct?     And you give your reasons?     At page 149.    You repeat some of the information you have already given about two people being charged in relation to the Mabula team torture investigation with no explanation for why the other accused members were not charged and other matters.     On page 32 Mr McBride you deal with the Reference Group.  Befor e you do so I would like to just allow you to see and to comment on the document placed before the commission by Advocate Muofhe who gave evidence before the commission and a document which shows the terms of reference at least apparent terms of reference on the letterhead of the Ministry of Police.  It is a letter addressed to Advocate Muofhe appointing him as a Reference Group member dated the 30 September 2014.  Before you give your evidence on the Reference Group I would just like to place this on record and before you.  We have extracted page 55 from the – I do not have the Exhibit letter of Advocate Muofhe’s evidence.  Yes it is 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  Exhibit Q I am told.  Anyway Chair may I hand up a copy of Exhibit Q1?     It is page 55 of Exhibit Q1 for record purposes but for convenience…     I have it here.      Exhibit Q.    Q1.    Page 55.  But this is only for convenience sake for you Chair and for the witness.  Would you just have a look please at the requirements placed upon the Reference Group?  I am not sure whether these are officials’ terms of reference but it is an instruction from Minister of Police Minister Nhleko to Advocate Muofhe setting out the tasks that the Reference Group is required to execute.      Just look at it please and comment if you will?  I must confess it is not very clear in respect of what these activities are intended to achieve.     Yes so for example it says “gather all necessary background and information and material” it does not say in respect of what.  It says interview persons and connection with specified matters.  The matters are not specified in this letter.  Research examine analyse written material documents or media articles relevant to each specified matter.  But this let ter at least does not specify the matters to be examined.  Do you know of your own knowledge what those matters were?     Or what any of those matters were?    Yes perhaps you better place evidence on record then.    Was IPID one of the institutions to be investigated in this respect by the Reference Group?     Alright and you have given extensive evidence in relation to the independence of IPID and who would have authority and who would not have authority.  We need not revisit that.    If you could deal with paragraph 139 please?    This was whilst he was now an advisor in the Reference Group?     He then aggressively demanded sight of the case file in …     Okay carry on please?    You then deal in paragraph 140 with your view in respect of the Portfolio Committee on Police and I presume you referring to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee?     You have a brief comment there in paragraph 140 what is that?     And you have dealt with the Portfolio Committee in a different context?    Mr McBride you have given lengthy evidence do you have any further comments to add before we conclude?    Sorry before you go on.  You referred earlier in your evidence to classification and refusal to declassify documents within Crime Intelligence.    And that this device was used you say improperly to impede your own investigations on serious matters relating to corruption?     Alright and you talking about surveillance equipment?     Alright so you say you have further evidence to give in regard to those issues.     Is there – I was going to pose a general request to you in relation to the analysis and addition done by yourself General Dramat and is it Mr Ivan Pillay which  was referred to in that article.    Which is now part of the bundle and I think you have undertaken to look at that analysis and if it is appropriate present it to the commission.     That is the evidence thank you Chair.    Chair I know it is only twenty past three there has been some uncertainty surrounding the timing of the next witness General Booysen.    And he will resume on recommencement.    Of the commission’s hearings on the 2 May.  If that suits the Chair.     Chair the background which perhaps I do not need to deal with here.  There will be a change but that is being managed.    Yes Chair there is.   So if…    2 n d we will be here Chair.    Yes Chair.  Ten o’clock is appropriate.    Thank you Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIU S SC:  And we know is this the same mr Mahlangu as the person who participated in the telephone conversation we have just dealt with?    You were also suspended?     That is the one aspect.  The paragraph 106 and 105 you refer to an order of court by Prinsloo J, is that not perhaps Tuchten J that should be referred to there?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETOR IUS SC:  Cedrick Nkabinde?    Alright. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes.    Yes.    Yes, yes.    That is correct yes.    In essence the Mabula Team moved to Gauteng.  So from North West they came to Gauteng and they set up in a hotel in, in the CBD of Pretoria or just outside the CBD in Arcadia and were basically permanently based there for I would say almost a year  and the only purpose for being there was dealing with O’Sullivan, Trent and IPID.    Okay.  Their, sorry 91 I say   No, no, no that is not correct.  This is prior to a search warrant even being obtained and prior to BS – to a search warrant being executed.    But not during the search warrant execution.    Yes.  That is – so they were with IPID Officials but they were charged for impersonating IPID Officials.     That is correct.    That is correct.    Yes indeed they were arrested.    During Trent’s arrest her mobile  phone was confiscated by the Mabula Team and booked in for investigation in order to support charges that were being fabricate against the pair and later on the IPID investigators that were added.  So at different occasions both Trent and O’Sullivan were arrested and I think O’Sullivan was arrested twice for the same case.  One of the instances I think there were, there was bail given and the bail had conditions attached to it and so which did not necessitate the second arrest.  Some undertakings were give n during the first arrest.  In any even O’Sullivan was arrested twice by the Mabula Team.     From what I remember Chair there were no specifics attached to it.  Mainly it was related to the fact that they accompanied IPID Officials and that they had spoken to witnesses who 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  provided statements.  I would just hasten to add here that at a later stage the Mabula Team visited every one of those witnesses and got them to change statements.    No, those who made statements implicating General Phahlane.    In, in.    The corrupt relationship and.    And so on.  They, every one of them were visited.    And altered their statement to some extent or another.    People who had indicated that they, they had seen bags of money being paid over to the contractor that is in cash.    Subsequently after the Mabula Team.    Had visited them.  So that is what 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  resulted in the defeating the ends of justice.  I think the second one being opened up against the Mabula Team.     Ja.    Yes.    That is correct yes.    Yes that is correct.    Yes.    Yes.    That is correct yes. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    That is correct yes.    Yes, yes.    Ja.    Ja.  If I can just give the context of this.  For the Mabula Team to leave North West and come to Gauteng 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  they would need their Provincial Commissioner’s permission.  To come and work in Gauteng they would need the Pr ovincial Commissioner of Gauteng’s permission also and, and that is why they are cited for allowing them to come into Gauteng to work if supposedly an offence they are investigating which occurred in Gauteng and just to indicate that Mahlangu is investigating Phahlane and was part of the initial team whilst I was on suspension still and that Binang was investigating General Mabula and his team from 2011 already under ICD.  ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    Yes.    Yes, yes.    That is correct.  That is correct.     That is correct yes.    Yes and just to – I would just like to add here Chair is that indeed it is the same Khomo who took 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  Mandla Mahlangu to Potchefstroom to meet with Mabula and Ncube to, to concoct a story.  So it is, so the team is investigating these people yet Khomo is the person who takes them to Mabula.  The fact that Mabula sees them is sinister for the bigger games at play here in addition to this litigation that is going on.     That is correct yes.    (No audible reply).    Yes, yes.    That is correct yes.    Yes, yes.    Yes that is correct Chair. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    That is correct.  Chair I just wanted to check.  I do not have – my page 25 is blank.    Okay.    Just to add that a key element in summing up in a judgment was that IPID has a provision in its Act, Section 25 that no investigator may be involved in an investigation in which he has any interest and that SAPS does not have a similar provision and at some stage there was a – at some stage there was a directive that the necessary, the necessary changes to the legislation or regulations of SAPS needs to be done but.     That is correct.  That is correct Chair.     Yes.    (No audible reply).    Yes I have it.    Yes, yes. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS    It was before the Tuchten judgment.     That is correct yes.    That is correct. 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84     So during May 2017 Brigadier Ncube of the Mabula Team on the instruction of Advocate  Molatlhwa Mashuga charged IPID investigators Mahlangu and Binang for alleg edly contravening the IPID Act.    That is correct yes.    Yes Chair.  Mahlangu and Binang were then joined to O’Sullivan and Trent as co accused.  I think in the transcript Mr Mahlangu refers to this and i ndicates that he was accused number 1 or two or number three.  He is accused 3 at some stage.  He is referring to this where they are all charged together - on page 1563.  He says I was accused 3 when he is talking about.     When Khomo is about adding other co accused on.  So this is what Mahlangu is referring to.     No that is information received by us.     The information received.    Ja.  That Trent was arrested and after been driven around for a whole was then interrogated and asked for her phone and then taken back to go and get the phone at the office where she was arrested.  This was at least an hour and a half later and the phone was then taken.  The phone was not part of a search warrant or relevant to any charge of impersonating an IPID Officer which were the charges at that stage.  The phone was then – the chain of evidence of the phone was last.  Rumours from within the police itself was that the phone was taken to Israel to get it downloaded.     That is correct yes.    That is correct.    So what is key in 96 is when Ncube came to IPID offices to take the warning statements of Messieurs Binang and Mahlangu I became aware that he is in the building.  So I then approached him and to ask him is it true that you 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  are from the North West and he said yes he is from the North West.  So I asked him how is it that you came here to Gauteng to carry out an investigation against my officers and I indicated to him that he is, is he aware that he is a suspect and that part of what he is doing he is defeating against – is an attempt to defeat the ends of justice.  He is a suspect in that investigation.  He then decided to charge me for intimidation because I enquired how he came from North West to be functional in Gauteng.  I am not – not sure where that case is.  I gave a warning statement to the investigator and I am sure it was thoroughly investigated.    Ja.    Well complaints were laid but it never, it never went to court ja.    It never went to court.  Even on the – we know that documents were prepared to make the whole case which started off as a security breach into racketeering and, and that is what Khomo was talking about “he is going down” and all of that.  It is about 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  the plan, the ruse, the concoction but it never comes to fruition perhaps as a result of the Tuchten judgment a nd that no other prosecutor would want to touch something so obnoxious.     Off the top of my head I cannot remember what it was about.  At one stage I was – Cedric Nkabinde brought a member who identified himself from Crime Intelligence and said he was aware of a conversation taking place to charge me and it was the Mabula Team and in particular Ncube talking to a prosecutor in order to obtain an arrest warrant and the Crime Intelligence person – you know – asked me is there any way I can help with this.  So  there was an arrest warrant being prepared and I said to the Crime Intelligence guy when I am investigating corruption there is no way I can come to any agreement or understanding or reconciliation.  They are suspects of IPID and so it cannot happen.  So they must do what they want.  My suspicion it might have been to do with Nkabinde’s double game he had been playing and basically in short the allegations were that three was a conspiracy to undermine the security cluster by targeting SAPS Officials.    Yes Chair.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    That is correct.    Thanks Chair.  By the time of the search and seizure the investigation had expanded and the 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  investigation basically involved a process of corrupt, corrupt relationship and.    Between.    Between General Phahlane and a number of service providers.  In this particular case a person by the name of Keith Keating from Foreign Data Analysts and Durand  Snyman and [intervenes].    I am not sure I did refer to Keating yet.     I think Criminal Analytics was another, another service provider.  I am not sure but there, there is a whole interrelationship with a lot of the service providers dealing with forensics.  In any event the structure, the model of the corruption involved these two entities in South Africa establishing Namibian equivalents and there are transactions between them in Namibia.  No transaction in South Africa and in that way money that is transferred to one company for example Company A to a South African Company A – the same company – would then be made available for patronage.  In one of these instances it was the roundabout trip of money went to – from SAPS as the client paying the service provider and then land ed in Namibia and a transaction between then one Namibian company and 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  the other one and then a car being made available for a, a corresponding amount and in terms of dates of the Namibian transaction.    That is correct.    Yes.    To give you another example is a person who was in charge of procurement did not have any transactions or improper relationship in South Africa with the service provider, but indeed did so with the same business in Namibia and in terms of the evidence a, a transaction for the same, same type of service took place in Namibia for the Namibian Police which involved a capitalisa tion of the Namibian equivalent of, of FDA and the policemen then [intervenes].    Forensic Data Analysists.  That is Keith Keating so – if I can put it – a twin company of Keating was set up in Namibia but it was owned by the police officer the general who had been responsible for issuing contracts or had been in an influential 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  position to influence contracts.    Ja.    I am using the example for the purposes of understanding that this was not petty corruption.  It was big corruption on a grand scale and i t involved billions.    And I will give other examples later on.  Just so that it is clear that we are not talking about one country or one, or one general but that we are dealing with a system of corruption that operates.  I will give two more examples just now.     That is correct.   Well the search warrants were executed and documentation including cash money – I think it was R800 000,00 was seized from Keith  Keating’s office for which an explanation is not given yet b ut which a few months after that he charged IPID investigators for stealing the money and an investigation team was rapidly set up and they were shocked when they came and saw the money had been bagged and tagged and was in a safe and 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  secure place as an ex hibit because they were made to believe it was stolen.  The money was declared at all relevant stages.  In any event Keith Keating went to challenge on a technicality the validity of the search warrant.    No it was not, but just to add a search warrant was executed at Phahlane’s house.  It is the second search warrant.  He never challenged that one where stuff was seized.  So he is dealing with the one where nothing was sei zed where there was identification.  I am mentioning that so you can see the malicious and ulterior motives in the court challenges and the litigation.  So in any event Keith Keating failed before Judge  Kollapen and he bizarrely sought to argue amongst other things that IPID Officers had no right to execute such warrants and that was clarified by the Judge.  He then applied for leave to appeal and that was refused.  Apparently he is approaching the SCA at the moment.     That is correct Chair.    Yes.    Yes.  So, thank you Chair.  In terms of the NPA I think firstly to note that there exists within IP ID a paper trail of engagement.  Letters upon letters and at all given stage engaging with them on instances where they have dragged their feet on certain cases including the Panday case, including the Mabula case and yet there seems to be obscene haste to  deal with anti-corruption people, people who fight against corruption including IPID.  Those issues are raised and the people who are quoted there we can give – I can give examples now about instances there of their involvement in what I believe is a bias view of what they are doing and we have a record of that and I am not in IPID now so I do not have access to those records and a litany of letters and the traffic of letters to Abrahams, Mzinyathi and Baloyi.  I can mention that there was a complaint give n against Baloyi by Mr Mahawka and Mr Khuba regarding the rendition matter because at a certain stage Khuba and Mahawka approached  Baloyi.  My understanding is it is at Baloyi’s insistence and they explained to 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  Baloyi that the difficulties were prosecution .  Baloyi’s response was and he went to – we assume it was Mzinyathi.  He says he has to go to his boss and he want to him and he came back and said no IPID must bite the bullet.  Formal complaints were made at that stage.  When I approached Mr Nosana about it he indicated he does not, he does not deal with stories.  I must put it in writing.  The two guys then submitted affidavits but no action was taken against Baloyi on any aspect.  There is a case of the open as a complainant against the Mabula Team by O’Sullivan and Trent on kidnapping and torture and a number of related matters.  Two senior public prosecutors recommended that in the interests of preserving human rights and having and removing any idea of impunity that there should be prosecutions and t hey gave a long – support the recommendation with case long and then it goes – the same case goes to Baloyi to decide.  The Baloyi in which we have complained against already.  Baloyi refuses to prosecute. The docket is returned.  The investigator then goe s to the two complainants - O’Sullivan and Trent - and informs them that there is a decision to decline to prosecute against them.  Immediately Baloyi recalls the docket.  The docket then goes back to Baloyi.  Letters are written for a review on Baloyi’s decision not to prosecute and it goes to Mzinyathi.  Mzinyathi says he agrees with Baloyi.  Abrahams says he agrees with Baloyi.  No reasons are given. They are not prosecuted now for amongst others kidnapping, defeating the ends of justice and torture.     Ja that is right.  Then of course Advocate Mayema with the rendition issue was one of those who went ahead with the prosecution in the absence of evide nce and including the disclaimer with the only evidence in his hand was the Werksmans Report.  We have spoken to – I mean Advocate Tori Pretorius is the one who gave the go ahead for our warrant of arrest and for our – and the decision to prosecute us on the rendition matter.  Yet it is the same Tory Pretorius who Mayema consulted for the final decision to withdraw charges against us in the absence of evidence which could sustain a prosecution. So all of the names mentioned of course Raymond Mathenjwa was in the reference group.  I am not sure whether he should have been in the reference group and involved in a process and making recommendations that ultimately led to Dramat and Sibiya being prosecuted without evidence to substantiate a prosecution and myself Khuba and Sesoko also.    Why would he make himself available on a police reference group?     That is correct Chair.    So the cases I mentioned they are documented and there is a paper trail of all of this that is in existence 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  but because I am not in IPID anymore I cannot access it.     Yes that is correct.    Hm.    I think I am coming to the conclusion that was all the evidence he had because if any of the evidence was relevant and of any prosecutorial value he would he would have placed it before the court.  He did no such thing.  On a point that Mr Sandile July refused to testify the matter was withdrawn and I think at that stage when Mr  Sandile July did not make himself available and was going to approach the courts so that he does not have to testify I actually think he did good by doing that.  One would have hoped he would have done good earlier on but credit to him he did not go and testify and he knows as a lawyer which is strange because he knew as a lawyer there is no evidentiary value in a hearsay statement of 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  hearsay which he was going to testify ab out and yet he could not see that an opinion of an investigator is of no consequence to decide whether to prosecute or not.    Absolutely Chair, absolutely.    So thanks Chair.  In the, in mentioning the names in 125 there are records and I give an example of the environment and I know we are all tired and we want to get done.  On one occasion after Sesoko came back and after Khuba came back we approached the NDPP to discuss these issues which we had written about.    IPID.  Yes that is correct and in one of the meetings he was – he had given us the floor for – to have a meeting and we were going to raise with him what the issues were and that is why Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba were with me and were going to raise issues and Mr Sesoko had prepared and he even had prepare d a presentation what he is going to deal with.  With this very issue of prosecutorial bias by the Prosecution Authority and in.     Thanks Chair.  The National Director of Public Prosecutions.    Yes.  So when we came.    It was Mr Shaun Abrahams.    Ja and so whilst we were there Mr Abrahams welcomed us and he continued speaking and he was with all his Deputy National Directors or Acting Deputy National.  There were a number of them there and h e started pre-empting what we had written to him to discuss already before we had spoken.  So he went on for about 20 minutes to a half an hour.  So I then asked him is IPID going to have a chance to speak in this meeting and so he burst out at me and told me to get out of his meeting and I said no but I wanted 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  answers.  I am not leaving and he proceeded to point at all his deputies that not one of them must comment in a meeting.  They must all keep quiet.  No comments allowed in the meeting and I found it very strange that the prosecutorial authority is subject to such intimidation.  What is poor little IPID going to experience in this.  So that gave me a good idea what is going on.  I mean in fairness to Mr  Shaun Abrahams afterwards I said to him I am glad  I did not leave your meeting and in response he said I am glad I did not insist you leave.  So we left on a professional basis but it really was an eye opener to see what the environment was like that and later on I could then understand when prosecutors in the NPA told us they were actually scared to act in a particular way because they perceived that this is the attitude of the NDPP and in fairness in the entire NDPP Phahlane and Keating and all these people no action would have been taken against them, search warrants, prosecutions, appearance in court if everyone was bad.  So there are good people there and there are good people who committed to fighting against corruption.  So I think it is important in fairness I need to mention them.    yes. 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84     Well I think the most appropriate response is to and the correct one as it was for example Dramat, Sibiya, Sesoko, Khuba and myself they have been told the outcome of investigations indicates evidence is not there to sustain the prosecution.  Prosecutions nevertheless go ahead.  There is evidence because they have to postpone for delays on Mahlangu, Binang, O’Sullivan, Trent.  They go ahead.  The matter is struck off the roll but on all these other matters which is a list of them and there are about 20 cases that have been investigated over years, no prosec utions. ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS   Well in the matters that were prosecuted and were later withdrawn or struck off the roll there was no evidence.  People were anti-corruption fighters.  In essence – and I have seen it with what happened in DPCI.  I have seen it with other people who have been fighting against corruption and the initial stages of and the initial stages of state capture.  Whereas in many of our cases as in IPID which we submitted to the NPA much of those dockets had gone to the NPA and the NPA said the following is missing.  We went and gone to get it and bring it back, send it back to them.  So to cover each and every possible evidentiary loophole  and in some instances investigations we were not cautiously precisely because we wanted to convince ourselves first that indeed there is a case and we would always ask ourselves about it and we got the evidence and it was 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  sustainable evidence and I am sur e that with the changes at the NPA we might see some prosecutions starting but the issue here is why was some prosecutions why did they not take place and we can start from Panday as one of the first cases that had dealt with to Phahlane to Mabula Team and there are a number of other corruption cases are starting to get – to be ventilated now in the open court and people are appearing in court.  So there is a change but at that time the bias we speak about it is indeed tangible and we can, we can back up wh at we are saying.    Yes.    Absolutely.    I just give an example which is one case which was another case of corruption.  Firstly there are all the cases relating to Crime Intelligence but there is one that mirrors Crime Intelligence case is the case of – it is 31 March.  It is 2016.  It is the end of the 2015/2016 financial year.  Someone in SAPS decides that there is an emergency – urgent need for a particular set of products.  They write a memo at 5 o’ clock in the afternoon.  The memo is 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84  approved.  So approval for the procurement.  Orders go out presumably.  Supplies are delivered.  In any event by 10 o’ clock that same evening a matter which was only generated that same day 54 million is paid out.  The stock is supposed to have arrived from Australia because it must be imported from Australia.  So I am not sure which transport method they were using but there is no way a product could arrive within five hours from Australia and 54 million went out on the same day and that is – it was not picked up by none of the agencies that should deal with that.  IPID picked it up with the cooperation of police officials.  That is an open and shut case of fraud and corruption.  It is there.  It has not been prosecuted.     Yes.    And so that is the [intervenes].    Yes, yes.    It is part of the range of Phahlane cases.    It has been there since.    Since we became aware of it say about six months to a. 16 APRIL 2019 – DAY 84     2017, ja.
