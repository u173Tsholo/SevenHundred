CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning everybody.    Are you ready?    Yes.    Ja as I recall one or other previous witness who testified on the matter – on the transaction I think may – it may have been I think probably it was Mr – Is it Ephron from…    Ephron.    Yes that they had – they had reached an understanding with various officials or structures within Eskom who supported the proposal they had made for an adjustment I think on the price of coal.  And there was a memorandum that was placed before the board.    Which had the support of management.    Of Eskom.    But when that matter came before the board Mr Brian Molefe had joined Eskom about three days before    And his arrival saw a complete change of attitude on the part of Eskom towards the deal that had been proposed and been supported by various levels of management.    And he adopted quite a hard line towards them.    Yes.  Maybe it was justified to do so maybe it was not but I do recall that part of the evidence.    That there seemed to have been – he seems to have taken a very hard line.    Towards them.  Yes.    You may wish as you proceed with the evidence of various witnesses you may wish to try and identify areas that are really not in dispute that have been testified to by other people and focus on those where they are – there may be disputes.    If possible.    Ja okay alright.    Do remember to raise your voice you have a soft voice.    So do remember to raise your voice.    Hm.    Okay please administer the oath or affirmation.    Welcome back Ms Daniels.  Thank you for coming back.  Alright.  You may proceed Mr Seleka.    Ja okay.    Yes Ms Daniels looks like she wants to say something.    Yes.    Okay five minutes, ten minutes?    A few min – okay alright.    Okay go ahead.    Well Ms Daniels we both the evidence leaders and myself want to be fair to everybody but we accept that people will have their views about whether we are fair or we are not fair and as for me while I care that people see that we are fair I am not going to try and make sure that it is their kind of fairness that I use.  It is fairness as I understand it that I will use – that I have always understood that I will use. You and other people might think differently both in regard to the evidence leaders and in regard to me but we will always – I certainly will always follow fairness as I understand it which might differ from your fairness as you expect it – to understand it and somebody else that will stick to the fairness as we understand it. When it comes to the questioning of witnesses there are various factors that – that count.  Today you might be questioned in a certain than which is different from the way you might be questioned three months later.  When certain investigations have been completed that were not completed when you appeared for the first time there are various factors that – that come in.   So – but as I say the public and individuals who are implicated or not implicated are free to have their own understanding of whether we are being fair to witnesses and to implicated persons.  But as I say I am not going to change anything just because somebody might think this is fair or not fair.  I have a certain understanding of fairness that I am following and that is the fairness that I am going to use. As I say if you appear today you might be questioned in a certain way because of certain circumstances. Maybe the investigation into certain matters in which you are alleged to have been involved have not – has not been completed.   When you appear later on and that investigation has been completed you might be questioned in a different way.  Or certain information might not have been confirmed at a certain time and at a certain time it is confirmed then you are confronted with it. But we – we are not going to try and follow anybody’s program.  We will follow only the commission’s program of how we do things. But throughout we remain committed to do the best we can to be fair to everybody as we understand fairness.  Okay.  Alright.    Ja.  Mr Seleka I do not know if you want to say anything arising out of Ms Daniels’ remarks?    For some reason I struggle to hear you; I do not know why in terms of what you are saying.  Just try again.    No, no, no, no, nobody wants…    Nobody wants it to be a debate.    You said something and I said something so that you know what my position is and the evidence leader said what he had to say and we move on.    Okay alright.      You – you refer to a Reference Bundle but the bundle I have with me is Eskom Bundle 18.  I do not know what Reference Bundle is supposed to mean.    Reference Bundle is normally used for documents other than affidavits.    As well as legislation and things like that.  So I am not sure.    Ja.    34 without the U or U34.1?    Ja okay.  The affidavit of Ms Suzanne Margaret Daniels starting at page 236 is admitted as Exhibit U34.1.    You nevertheless might wish to consider whether that writing there that says Reference Bundle is correct or whether it will just cause confusion?   Because a Reference Bundle will normally not …    Will not include affidavits and so on.    Ja.    Okay alright.    Ja.    There is a problem.    Is it hot – can we switch off the air conditioner?  Will it be hot for people?    Or shall we switch it off for the – for a certain time and if there are complaints then we can switch it on.    I think somebody will – or put it down a bit not – because it also makes some noise.  Okay alright.       Yes.  What was your position in the company at the time?  Where you company secretary?     In November 2015?     In November 2015?     You became Company Secretary in October?     But your involvement in the matter was in November.  Is that right?     Yes.       Well, maybe Mr Seleka because we have got to also assist the public to follow what is happening.     It might be necessary to just through Ms Daniels inform the public what this whole transaction was about.     Ja, before we proceed.     If you are going to ask her to confirm, you might need to ...[intervenes]      To ask her because by the time you are finished, she may have forgotten.     Ja.  You might get her to confirm how much of what you have said is in accordance with her understanding.     H’m.     Do you, Ms Daniels, recall those facts.     Ja.  Now could you tell the Chairperson then what role did you play in the build-up to the decision made by the board on the 9t h of December 2015 regarding the prepayment of R 1.68 billion?     What page?     H’m.          Yes.     Ja, ja.  H’m.     Just one second Mr Seleka.     Just go back to the two versions.  Your version and Dr Ngubane’s version about who said there should be a meeting of the board should be called.  You say that he instructed you to convene a meeting of the board.  And according to Mr Seleka, he says ...[intervenes]      ...requested an urgent meeting of the board.  And you say you did not request a meeting of the board.  And as I understand you, you say you did not request because it would not be up to you whether there should be a meeting of the board.  Is that right?     Could it be that you suggested as Company Secretary that there was a need for a board meeting and you left it up to him whether he went along with the suggestion because I guess it is a suggestion you could make. MS     H’m, h’m.     H’m.  Yes.  Continue Mr Seleka.     I am sorry.  The Chief Executive of – the Group Chief Executive of Eskom and financial officer or financial director.  They were ex-officio members of the board, is that correct?     What about the company secretary, is the company secretary also an ex-officio member of the board or does he or she simply attend to – facilitate recordkeeping and so on?     The company secretary would provide basically a resource to the board.     To make the work of the board easier, to make sure that records are kept properly and also advise the board on some legislative matters?     Ja, okay, Mr Seleka? ADV SELEKA     Just continue, I am looking at the beginning of the submission.       That is where I am looking.     Also, there seems to be no reference to any rehabilitation, is it not?     What, the rehabilitation?  What was the hook?     Yes, Mr Seleka?     What page is the resolution, where is the submission again?     281.     Yes, okay.     That is Tegeta.     Okay.     Well, by the way, did you prepare the submission?  Who prepared the submission?     Yes, Mr Seleka?     Maybe before you move on, Mr Seleka.     Ms Daniels, your earlier versions of the draft, was there any different between it – or those drafts and the ultimate paragraph 2.1.2?     Ja, you can have a look if there is something that will refresh your memory.     You have got them or you do not have them?     Are they in another bundle, Mr Seleka?     Oh, have you got them somewhere?     Oh, does the investigator have them?   Ja, okay, we can proceed while somebody is looking for them. But what is your recollection or you cannot remember?     Okay, we will wait until we have got the drafts.  Proceed, Mr Seleka.     Well maybe go closer to the microphone maybe, Mr Seleka.     We are at one o’clock.  Those drafts, have they been found?  Do they have 2.1.2?     Do they appear at 443?  Oh yes, I can see 2.2 seems to be same as 2.1.2 but maybe not exactly.     Well, if you compare 2.2 at page 444 and 2.1.2 up to a certain point they seem to be the same but what appears at 2.2 at page 444, there seems to be something else that has been cut off, excised, but it would appear, Ms Daniels, that even in your own draft you had written that the Chief Financial Officer – oh, you did not     So it would seem that whoever settled that submission might not have initiated that wording and that that wording may have come from you.  Is that right?     The wording I am referring to…     Is    Yes but I thought that was precisely Mr Seleka’s concern, that when you look at the – it was to be a pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Mine and I think Mr Seleka’s point and Mr Seleka must tell me if I misunderstood.     Mr Seleka’s point I thought was one would expect that the negotiations were going to be with Optimum Coal Mine and not with the proposed owners of Optimum Coal.  He was saying it is strange that 2.2 and 2.1.2 on the final submission says that these officials of Eskom mentioned there were being authorised to negotiate with the proposed owners instead of saying they must negotiate with OCM.  That is the point he was making.     Ja.  What do you say – why did you write that, what was the rationale behind...?     H’m?     From whom?     And why – did you ask him why the submission should talk about the officials of Eskom being authorised to negotiate with the proposed owners of OCM instead of negotiating with OCM itself, did you raise that issue with him ...[intervenes]      Because it wouldn’t have made sense to you.     Ja, but why wouldn’t you have raised it, it doesn’t make sense.     Yes, so what was in that meeting that could make one understand this.     Yes?     I mean well it may well be that if you have an agreement with somebody and somebody else is likely to take that entity over there might be cause to talk to the proposed owners with regard to the future, it may be that that is it, but one would normally have expected that since the proposed owners were not owners as yet that the negotiations would be with the supplier, you understand that?     Okay Mr Seleka I think we must take the lunch adjournment.      It is about eight minutes or nine minutes past one we will adjourn and resume at ten past two.   We adjourn.     Okay, let’s continue.     Can I request that – I’m sorry Mr Seleka, there is first that the – in the submission contemplated the Board would note from the Department of Mineral Resources was the request from Dr Ramontja’s letter – in Dr Ramontja’s letter that Eskom should play an active role in providing support for the project to proceed?     What did that mean, do you know?     Which of these paragraphs did Dr Ramontja say he did not put in his letter, Mr Seleka?     At all?     There’s a letter that he received from Eskom and I think it must have been Mr Koko as well, where he did not authorise a response, I think but somebody else in DMR, if I recall correctly, prepared a response that was supposed to be sent off only after him authorising it, so it must be another letter because this one has got his signature.     Ja, okay, alright continue.     So, in other words, there is nothing else of any consequence that the Board was told other than the contents of the submission?     Ja, so if anyone wants to know, what was the Board told, it’s what’s in the submission?     Ja, there was no discussion outside of the document?     Hmm, okay.  Why was it not necessary to let a matter involving such big amounts – such a big amount be decided by way of a Round Robin without the benefit of a proper discussion among Board members?     And whose instruction was that?     Okay, Mr Seleka?     Was that your decision as opposed to an instruction to you from somebody else?     Was it your decision?     Had you been instructed as to – to whom you were supposed to address the submission?     Yes, the reference to the Board, what do you say about it?     Okay, Mr Seleka?     Well, let’s start with this, has he seen your summary or your document, the submission?     Yes, no, no I accept that, I want you to confirm.     That he has seen that he has seen it?   No, I accept that, based on…[intervenes].     And is he making submissions – is he making suggestions of what to be removed and what to be amended?     Yes, but he says he has identified a part that he says should be removed?     And he says that it should not be addressed to the Investment and Finance Committee it should be addressed to the full Board?     Yes, yes continue.     Why do you say that?     Is that the Businessman email?     Oh, infoportal1, were you not aware of it at that time?     Oh, but the email address you were?     Ja, okay.  When did you become aware of the email exchange? ADV SELEKA     Oh, the Commission.     In?     2018, okay, Mr Seleka.     Do you know whether Mr Singh also signed it, I see he didn’t sign on this one, is there another copy that is signed?     Oh yes.     I’m looking at 497.     Okay.     I’m sorry, just for my understanding what was the ranking between the CFO and Group Executive Generation?    Of the?    Yes – was the CFO not part of the Executive Committee?    Well it is confusing me because you have – we looked at an email a few minutes ago where I think Mr Koko addressed an email – ja at page 486 to Mr Singh and addressed him as Boss.    And now at 497 Mr Koko appears to be the last one to sign in terms of what I take it to be hierarchy?    Oh that Mr Koko.    Who – you say Mr Singh was acting as Group CEO?    Yes but on this document he did not sign in that capacity at 497?    Yes.    But as Chief Financial Officer when you compare to Group Executive Generation that is what I am asking what is the hierarchy?    Between the two of them?    Ja well it is does not make the sense that one has got over the time.  One has seen that usually the highest ranking official would be the last to sign after everybody has made recommendations and then the last – the highest ranking official then makes the decision.    Whereas here – ja you have the Chief Financial Officer before Mr Koko.  Okay so I guess you – there is nothing you can – you can say about it?    Hm.    Were they – were they on the same level or were they not on the same level or is that something you would not know?    The Chief Financial Officer and Group Executive Generation.    Or was one of them higher than the other in terms of the company hierarchy?    Hm.    Okay.     Okay alright.  Mr Seleka.    Okay.    I am sorry I thought you said 459?    What is the point you were making about page 497?    Yes okay.    I am sorry I may have lost you Mr Seleka.    At what page are you now with the board – whether the board made a decision – what page?    Oh okay.    Okay I thought  maybe you were at that page ja.    Okay.    And that 486?    Mr Seleka.    Is that at 486?    The email from Mr Koko.    Okay.    I think she has mentioned quite a few pages.  545 was one of them is it not?    So should we go to 537?     Yes.     I am sorry.  Did you say his approval is at 569?     Oh, okay.  Thanks.  H’m.     Oh, okay.     At the instruction of...?     Mr Singh, ja.     What was the significance of converting it from – converting from cash to guarantee as you understood it, if you do understand it?     But was it not interesting that that conversion was thought of at the level of execution as oppose to the level of the decision being taken by the board?      And this was the board that was appointed at the same here, is that right?  In March ...[intervenes]    The same board that suspended executives?     And the chair had been appointed...  What, December?     December 2014.     Ja.     H’m?     H’m.  Yes, okay.     But also, is the position not that once the guarantee has been put in place, has been secured?  You cannot undo it or can you undo it?       It was subject to some conditions?     H’m.  So it would be paid if certain conditions ...[intervenes]      H’m.  Mr Seleka.     Is the entity in favour of whom the guarantee was made if from the entity which was going to get cash before the guarantee was introduced?     H’m?     Yes.  So it is a completely different thing.     And not mandated by the board?     H’m.     This is a few months after Mr Anoj Singh has joined Eskom?     Yes.     He has not even finished the year. MS     Yes.     He acted first.       He acted for some time.     And he was appointed.     When Brian Molefe started, joined in April 2015 and acted as Group CEO.  Mr Singh came about, what, three months after that, two months, three months to act.     1 August, okay.     Ja.     And before he arrives who was acting as Financial Director, was it Ms Dlamini?     Veleti?.     Okay.     Ja.     From which page in her affidavit does she deal with that topic?     Okay, I have got it.     Before we do that, go there, we deal with that, Mr Seleka.     On the guarantee…     Have we reached the end of that part?     Okay, alright.  Okay.     Okay.     Sorry, the meeting was meant to be when?     The 13 t h?     Three zero.     One three, yes.  And Mr Khoza was phoning you on what date?       On the 11 t h.     Yes.  The meeting on the 13 t h was going to be a meeting of the board tender committee.     And now he wanted you to convene a meeting of the same committee on the evening of the same day on which he called you.     Namely the 11 t h.     Yes.  And this meeting that he wanted you to call, was it going to take the place of the meeting on the 13 t h or was it going to be an additional meeting?  So there were going to be two meeting, in other words or not?     Okay.     Yes.     Oh, so he wanted the meeting of the 11 t h to deal with what?     Yes.     Okay, one second.  Mr Seleka, we are at three minutes past four.  Let us take an adjournment, we can continue, and if that is fine with everybody, maybe until about quarter to five or thereabouts and then I will be ready to start the evening session.     With – for another witness.  So let us take a short adjournment now of ten minutes.  Let us resume at quarter past.     Okay, we adjourn. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     Okay let’s continue.     Oh yes.       Or on the strength of that agreement.     And that is not his Eskom email address hey?     Email address.   Yes but did you know it to be his personal email address or you are just saying because it has got his name?       Okay.     But it looks like Businessman instructs Mr Matshela Koko and Mr Matshela Koko instructs you?     Why not?     Well would Mr Matshela Koko have sent you this type of documents or instructions without any discussion with you first as to what they really related to and why they – it was necessary to include them in an agreement or guarantee?        And discussed with you?     Ja, but this time did he?     Because you see if he didn’t discuss them with you before he sent them to you my intimation is to think that you would have been surprised where is he getting all of these things without discussing them with you and that you would have wanted to discuss with him before even sending to Mr ...[indistinct] or whoever, but did you discuss with him these terms, these issues before you instructed attorneys to assist you.     And Mr Koko says that the two of you were very close and 2015 is all within the years that he says that the two of you were very close, he said when he was giving evidence last week that in township lingo you were tight.     You confirm you were very close?     Yes at that time, so one would have expected that he would have discussed these things with you and if he didn’t you would find that strange and maybe ...[intervenes]      And say where does this come from, you haven’t discussed this with me.     Mmm.     Mr Seleka?     Why wouldn’t you have sought to confirm whether that was so?     You look?     But you were Company Secretary at the time, you were a lawyer, you had an opinion, you advised on contracts isn’t it?   Or that was your previous position or you still did that when you were Company Secretary in terms of contracts, you were no longer involved in advising on contracts but you had the knowledge.     Yes, and what this was about was connected with contracts?     And you realised that there is this Businessman who is effectively instructing Mr Koko to do certain things about contracts or guarantees and Mr Koko in turn instructs you to give effect to that.  Surely that should have concerned you to say well who is this person that I don’t know within Eskom who is giving instructions and I am supposed to carry out the instructions. MS     But you would have seen from the emails isn’t it that originally it comes from Mr Businessman?     So I am – and you didn’t know anybody within Eskom whose email address was Businessman?     So you would have thought it must be somebody from outside.     And that should have worried you.     And you would have been, you would have been concerned whether the affairs of Eskom were now being dictated to by forces outside of Eskom and you would not have wanted to be part of that isn’t it?     And therefore once that was the thinking you would have – one would expect that you would confront Mr Koko, more so he was close to you at the time so you would have no reason to fear that maybe he wouldn’t take it positively.    You would have – you should have raised the issue with him to say but where are you getting these ideas from, because you are not getting them from within Eskom.     But do you accept that it would be strange if you didn’t raise the issue and yet being aware that it seemed that forces outside of Eskom were giving instructions as to what Eskom officials should do?     Well he said your relationship soured between the two of you, the relationship between the two of you only soured in 2017 if I recall correctly.     On your version when did it sour?     Of course earlier than December, I think at the latest if I am not mistaken from your previous evidence here, in September of 20 – I think 15 I don’t know if it was 14 but I think 15 or it must be 15 because Dr Ngubane only joined 2015 was the first calendar year that he was a member of the Board, from your previous evidence you recall that there were emails that came in from – if it was not Businessman it was Infoportal, and there is a dispute between yourself and Dr Ngubane, you said in effect – I am putting it in my own words, this person sought to communicate with him and you were just given instructions by Dr Ngubane, I think he says he pushes the blame to you that you were the – you would be the person who knew about this person but that email address Mr Seleka was either Businessman or Infoportal isn’t it?     Yes.    Ja.     Ja.    Oh it is the same email address?    So – so the point Ms Daniels is how – how can you in December when you see this Businessman, this email address that sends email to Matshela Koko and he is saying – sends instructions to you.  So how can you still not raise the issue when that is not just the first time you had another occasion or other occasions about the same email address?  Unless of course the other scenario is if you knew then obviously you did not raise anything?    But that suspicion is the one that should have driven you to ask.  That is part of the point.    Why did it not drive you to ask?    Mr Matshela Koko.  Mr Matshela Koko who is this person that is sending us this – sending you instructions and you send them to me because obviously this is somebody outside of Eskom?  Who is this – what is happening?  Why did you not ask that?    You would not cause any trouble for yourself with Mr Koko he was – the two of you were tight.    So if it is..    You were close.    hm.    But you agreed earlier on.    Five minutes ago.    No but Ms – you cannot say if there was not something that you suspected to be something wrong.  You cannot say that you would not have been in a position to raise it with Mr Koko?    Yes but at least at the level of wanting to understand.  You say I do not understand who is this Businessman?  So it cannot victimise you for that.  He cannot.  You are just enquiring.  Who is this person?  I see that you pass on to me instructions that are given to you by somebody that seems to be outside of Eskom.    But you accept it or do you not accept that the other possibility of course is for somebody in your position not to raise the issue was if they knew who – exactly what was going on?    You accept that proposition.    Yes.    Hm.    Mr Seleka I see we have gone beyond quarter to?    But if you want one or two questions to.    To finish for the day that is fine.    Did you wait until you were asked to advise or did you advise as you saw the need?    Mr Seleka.    Okay thank you Ms Daniels you will come back – another date will be arranged.    For now you are excused thank you.    Okay.  I have not seen the next evidence leader but I am sure.    Oh he is here I can…    I can see him.  Ja okay.  I will take a short adjournment to enable them to set up and then we will go into the evening shift.  Okay we adjourn.     Good afternoon Mr Chaskalson.  Good afternoon everybody.     Yes, are we ready?     Yes, he is continuing with his evidence.  Good afternoon Mr Holden.     Yes.  The oath that was applicable Friday, it continues to apply, oath or affirmation.  Okay, alright.     Oh, just for the record.  Mr Chaskalson, if you could confirm again what bundle we are still using?     Ja.  Flow of Funds, Bundle 6.  Thank you.     H’m.     Okay.       Somebody will bring it to you Mr Holden.     It does not look like I have got 869 and after that, it is 870.     Coming my way?     Okay.  [laughs]      Yes.       We will take a five minute adjournment. INQUIRY ADJOURNS INQUIRY RESUMES     No problem.  Yes, let us continue.     You are now using a different bundle, hey?     Yes.     Oh, okay.  I am just trying to think of what we are saying to the record to make sure that somebody who keeps on following Bundle 6 does not get confused.     Ja.     Yes.     Yes.     Bundle B, ja.     Yes.  Ja, so basically, Bundle 6 has now been split into two bundles, 6A and 6B.     Yes, okay alright.  So going forward, there will no reference to just Bundle 6.  It will either be Bundle 6A or Bundle 6B.     Ja, okay alright.  Thank you.  Okay.     Thank you.     What is the page number?     Okay.     It is 419, né?     Okay.  Yes, I have got it.     Thank you, thank you.  But it includes 546.42, hey?     Ja, ja.  That is what will make it easy to get clarity.     Yes, yes.  The date you give for this email Mr Holden, is it because you are able to read that language?  [laughs] Or that writing there because I cannot see.  I can see the year.  I do not see the month.  Ja, I think you said February.     Oh, January.  Oh, that is the one?     Oh.     Oh, is it 6 January?     Oh, okay, okay.     H’m, h’m.     What does R 50.48 million represent?     What does R 50.48 million represent in respect of 359 Project?     Oh, okay.  I would have thought it was much more than that but...  Okay.     Oh, per locomotive.     Oh, okay.  Ja, I think that is important to – per locomotive.     Maybe before you say that.  So I guess, strictly speaking Mr Chaskalson, because it was one contract for an X number of locomotives.  It is not accurate to say R 50.48 million is the contract price because the contract price includes all the 359 Locomotives or whatever, is it not?      Yes, okay.  No, I just want that for myself to...     Okay alright. So that is – the R 50.48 million is one locomotive?     Ja.     Yes.     Of that contract.  Okay.     Yes, okay.  No, that is fine.       I think Mr Chaskalson wanted you to explain something and I interrupted him.     Ja, I think so.     Yes, okay.  I did, ja.     H’m.     H’m, h’m.     Yes, okay.  Somebody should just assist you with a pen.  Oh, you have got one?     Oh, okay he has got it.       Okay.     Please repeat that page Mr Chaskalson.     629.     Oh, 298.     Ja, okay.  Yes, I have got it.     346?     Yes, continue.     I am sorry, what is the page where the services...?     376.  Okay, thank you.  I have got it.      Well, I found the - apart from this one, this clause, I found that other one, what is it, 3? “Closely coordinate with the designated authorities to comprehend the applicable government policies.” [Laughs].  Yes.     2014, 2015 in Eskom and Transnet were quite busy.     Oh, yes.  I was looking for the email address, I have seen it here, okay.    It was after July.  You said after July 15?    I was looking at the right page.  You must have said it.  I was looking at the right page, you must have said it.     The parties now hereby agree to restructure?  To restructure the payment method as follows?  That is 2. – that is 2.1 and then there is 2.1.      2.2 Starts with, that within 10 working days.    Ja.    Ja, ja, you have – well 425 is, is it one signature there.  And then the one where which would have been your 425.1 is the, is the outside page with, with the names of the parties.  So there must be some page missing.  Or pages …    Yes, no that is fine.    That’s fine.    Ja.    It’s got, it’s handwritten at the top, Agreement number 0661 blah, blah, blah, blah.    [Indistinct].  Okay.    Yes.  Are these the best copies you have Mr Chaskalson?    Okay.    Alright.    Which one?  Let me – which one?  Which date do you have, are looking at by the stand?    Is that the last?   [Indistinct] 18, line? But it is dangerous to …    Yes, okay.      Does it indicate where whoever signed, where it was signed?  I saw that the previous one I think was signed in Sandton.  The one of the ones that we just looked at was signed in Sandton.      Yes.    Yes.  Ja.  Okay, alright.    A very senior?    Oh okay.    You said 1110.    That’s A.    Okay.  Well it’s been a long day, so but I see that the first page is 869?    Oh 1110?    No I didn’t hear the zero.  So I was wondering how 111 could be on this bundle.  Okay.  1110.  Ja, I have got it.      Is it the top one or the bottom email?    1112.    Okay, ja.    Oh okay.      Yes.    Well Mr Chaskalson you recall that yes, in years gone by in the Magistrate’s court or maybe in the High Court’s the interpreter would always sometimes describe whatever the witness is doing, to say well the face looks like he’s shocked.  So you might have to describe.      Yes.    One second.  So – can we infer that the same mentioned at 1122 is the same Singh mentioned at 1123?  Namely Mr Anash Singh?   Or not?    Yes, okay.  No, no, when I was looking at 1122, that second line, after the greetings first line.  I saw that they said Mr Singh without giving the name, but or there is another Singh.  Ashika Singh, later in the …    Anash Singh.  Okay, now ja I didn’t see that.  Okay.  So this is February 2015.    Ja, okay.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Hang on one second.  Did you say 995.1?    On?    I don’t think I have.  I’ve got 995.  Let me just see.  Ja, no I don’t have 995.1.  I have got 995.  And then the next one is 996.      995.1.     Yes.    Okay.  So you can just repeat.  Just replace the old pages, the other pages.    Oh okay.  Okay.  Well I think 995 is one side or 995 and 996 are on the same page, on the same document.  Yes.      Ja.    But in the meantime I think we can make do with – ja, okay, alright.    Yes.    Yes.    What’s the page on 6A?    263.  Yes.    Okay.  Okay.  Of course the writing, the words are very small on those.    But maybe Mr Holden has been able to make a plan instead.    Ja.    Okay, okay.    And as US dollars.  What?  Is that US dollars?      Okay.  Ja, and Regiments.      Okay.    599.11.    995.11.  Yes I’m there.    Payments.    Okay.    Okay.  And then I’m not looking here because I can’t read anything.  But so.    Yes.    Ja.    Okay.    And it looks like Ama Bongani got it right.    Ja.   Maybe before we proceed Mr Chaskalson, let’s talk about our plan for the evening.  What is your situation?  Your assessment?      Okay, well.  I think, I think then that should be fine.  Ja.    Ja, okay.     I am sorry Mr Chaskalson it may be that at some stage somebody must do an exercise to go back to where we used this Bundle 6 and if we are now only going to have A and B we won’t have the original Bundle 6 and in the transcript indicate where it is supposed to be A and where it’s supposed to be B.     But if we are going to have maybe for convenience the original 6 which is combined then that exercise won’t be necessary and then still have 6A and 6B because then it would mean that where the transcript reads 6A whoever has the files can go to 6A where it says 6B they can go to 6B, where it simply says 6 without saying A or B then there will be a file written 6.     Ja okay. ADV CHASKALSON SC;   At page 267 of Bundle 6A you record  a range of individuals who were paid out of the Tequesta and Regiments Asia accounts.  Can you just quickly give – take the Chair through those payments.     1094?     6B 1094?     I have got it.     Are we still on the same bundle?     Oh okay, 277 on the other one.     Oh okay, alright, yes I have got it.     In the other bundle?     Yes, okay.     Yes we looked at some paragraph 1096 then there is 1097.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes.     Just the page again Mr Chaskalson?     1051, yes.     Yes, yes.     I would like you to be on standby for earlier than today but I am not sure how long, I think if you speak to Mr Seleka he might give an indication whether two o’clock would ...[intervenes]      Then that would be in order ja, that would be in order. Okay alright.     Thank you very much and thank you to everybody for working late, so we shall still be here tomorrow hopefully not until this time but if it has to be it has to be, but thank you very much Mr Holden, thank you Mr Chaskalson and your team, thank you to the staff.  We are going to adjourn for the day. We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Good morning DCJ.    Yes Chairperson.    Thank you.  Chairperson this week the commission from the Eskom work stream will be leading evidence on what we have referred to as the transections and it is mainly the Tegeta issues emanating from some of the evidence that was led in phase 1 in regard to the pre-payments decisions made by the board. Just by way of introduction in regard to that Chairperson back in 2015 and 2016 Eskom did some decisions – took some decisions in regard to a company called Optimum Coal Mine.   This mine Chairperson was at that time in some challenging position in regard to mining and the provision of coal to Transnet – to Eskom I beg your pardon and it was seeking to negotiate better deals with Eskom. There was some cooperation agreement concluded in 2014 which was to serve before the board. That cooperation agreement with an addendum to the coal agreement that existed at the time in order to amend the terms of the agreement in regard to pricing served before the BTC in April. The BTC did not make a decision Chairperson it referred the matter to the board.  The timing is important because this matter was referred to the board on the 23 April 2015. The board did not make a decision on the issue rather it decided to refer it to the newly seconded Mr Brian Molefe the announcement of whom was made on the 17 April 2015 by Minister Lynne Brown to second him. The gains that had been made in the negotiation process with Optimum saw the beginning of the end of that process Chairperson as Mr Molefe then terminated the cooperation agreement, terminated negotiations agreements, insisted on Optimum continuing to provide coal to Eskom.    Ephron.    Yes.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    Yes.    Correct Chair.    Yes.    Towards Optimum.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes Chair.  Yes indeed Chairperson.  So there the board on the 23 April 2015 does not decide the matter.  It refers to Mr Molefe who had just arrived and in fact in the same meeting you see the board making its first decision in regard to the secondment of Mr Molefe. The approved the secondment which was effective to start effectively on the 20 April 2015.  And the handling of the matter then leads to the termination, the enforcement of the 10.1 billion penalties which I might add while referring to them Chair once Tegeta obtained Optimum – acquired Optimum the – the penalties of 2.1 billion they get settled with Tegeta at R599 million but there are still deductions to be made to that amount.  The payable amount ultimately is only R255 million to be paid over 20 months Tegeta still defaults on that amount.  It pays hardly half of that and immediately thereafter it goes into business rescue. So Eskom although it used the – a huge amount against Optimum it reduced it significantly when Tegeta was the owner of the mine. And then by the decisions regarding pre-payments which are made in favour of Tegeta and the narrative is that there are pre-payments made on an urgent basis. The first one by Round Robin, the other one by telephone conference were made on an urgent basis for a different purpose – an ulterior motive. That motive being to assist Tegeta in the acquisition of Optimum. There will be two submissions in respect of both decisions made and we will deal with the motivation contained in those submissions and the witnesses will be asked questions relative to the validity or otherwise of those motivations Chairperson. We have that – that is the evidence and the elements of it will unfold Chairperson during the evidence of the various witnesses this week.  I think that sums up what we have to do this week.    Yes Chair.    Yes Chair.    Yes.  Yes I am – ja – with that in mind Chair the persons that will be called mainly today are those that – I mean this week are those that for lack of a better word implicated in the masterminding of these transactions.  Thank you Chair. So the first witness this week Chairperson is Ms Suzanne Daniels.  She was the Company Secretary in 20 – from October 2015 at Eskom and she is ready to take the oath.    Ja.    Indeed Chairperson.    So the first witness is Ms Suzanne Daniels who was the Company Secretary from October 15 at Eskom and she is ready to take the oath.    Suzanne Margaret Daniels.    Thank – thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.    Chairperson we using Eskom Bundle 18 – 18 Exhibit U34.    Ms Daniels affidavit is found on page 236.    Ja Chair I might add that to – what the Chairperson is saying Ms Suzanne Daniels – Ms Daniels it also depends on the level of a person’s involvement in what we find in the investigation.  As the Chairperson says the manner of pursuing questions against an individual witness tends on what the evidence is and what it points in regard to the individual witness. So I concur with the Chairperson on that point.    Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Daniels the bundle in front of you contains an affidavit on page 236 – now you follow the page numbering on the top left hand corner – page 236.  Between tramlines is affidavit on transactions.    You see that.  This affidavit runs up to page 267.    Yes.  There is a signature there by the deponent do you confirm that to be your signature?    On 30 November 2020.    And you confirm the affidavit to be your affidavit then?    Thank you Chair.  Chairperson it is part of the Reference Bundle.    Oh yes Eskom Bundle.    Yes.    Sorry Chair.  Let us go with Eskom Bundle 18.    It is Exhibit U34 and we could mark the affidavit of Ms Suzanne Margaret Daniels as Exhibit 34.1.    U34.1.    Thank you Chairperson.    Ja.    Correct Chair.    Correct Chair.    Yes.    Ms Daniels a great deal of the evidence on the Tegeta matter was led in phase 1 of the commission and I would like you to tell the Chairperson and as we go along we will indicate what has come before this commission so that it does not have to be traversed. But we would like you to indicate to the Chairperson in regard to the Tegeta matter in 2015 when do you first become involved or faced with this matter?    Ja.    I think I cannot hear you also.    You need to adjust your microphone.    Ja.    Ja the…    I do not see the Reverend here.     So what ...[intervenes]      Yes.     Yes.     Yes.  Yes, Ms Daniels from the evidence that was led.  The Commission understand that the Eskom Board were – was considering the – it took part in discussion that had to do with the acquisition by Tegeta or Oakbay of Optimum.   Optimum was, at the time, providing coal to Eskom in terms of a Coal Supply Agreement that dated back to 1983.  The mine had exchange hands over time and at this time and point, the mine was owned by Glencore. Glencore owned Optimum Holdings.  Optimum Coal Holdings which was a holding company of Optimum Coal Mine.  Now during this time, these discussions between Optimum and Eskom to renegotiate the agreement, as I did in my opening address, did say.   Oakbay and Tegeta at some point, tendered to buy Optimum.  They tendered to purchase Optimum for the price of R 2.1 billion.  It would appear from the evidence that Optimum – or rather, Tegeta and Oakbay did not have the funds to procure their position. As a result of which, we see steps taken within Eskom.  They seem to be independent of what is happening in regard to this transaction.  There are urgent steps taken in December 2015 to approve a prepayment of R 1.68 billion for Tegeta.  And the reasons are given to be an emergency supply of coal.   That prepayment is agreed to by the board but the very next day, it was changed into a guarantee.  But the decision for a guarantee, does not go back to the board.  It is done by the CFO, on the face of it, in the terms of this evidence. And it would appear that the guarantee of that R 1.68 billion issued by Eskom in favour of Tegeta was a tool used by Tegeta to show the business rescue practitioner of OCM Optimum Coal Mine that it has the necessary funding to pay for the purchase of the mine. That is the one transaction.  Some four months later, we are now in 2016, April 2016 ...[intervenes]      To ask...     Okay thank you Chair.     Yes.  Oh, Chair now I get – I get the Chairperson’s idea.     [No audible reply]      So Ms Daniels, is it correct that prior to that point or up until that point, the sale that had been negotiated was in regard to the acquisition of Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) Ltd?     So what you are saying is, Mr Koko was then expanding the scope of the acquisition to include OCM Coal Holdings, the assets belonging to OCM Optimum Coal Holdings?     And what was the response from Mr Howa?     Is it Mr Howa who responded?     Yes.  So just take us then to what happened next, after this?     It is about the 4 t h...?     24t h of December 2015?     Ja.  And what happens there?     And you had worked this time?     So Mr Koko is requesting you to do what?     Okay.  Did you do that?     Yes.  And it is correspondence to what effect?     Yes.  Please turn to page 270 in your bundle.       Two, seven, zero Chair.     270.  Ms Daniels, can you identify the document?     Yes, what is it?     That you what?     That you had prepared for Mr Koko.     Yes.  So Dr Ramontja has testified before the Commission.  So the letter is common course.  Did you understand what Mr Koko sought to achieve by this letter?     Did he – did you ask him what assistance he sought you to obtain from the DMR?      He just wanted the put the information before the DMR.     Chair, should I read certain salient ...[intervenes]      ...points of the letter into the record?     Thank you, Chair.  So the letter reads –     We know from the evidence presented in Phase 1 that there was a response to this letter from Dr Thibedi Ramontja.     Were you aware of that response?     Just briefly.  Your recollection of what the DMR’s response was.     Are you looking for that response?     Let us see what – on page two, six...  Page 276.       Page 276.     Just briefly what the response was.       Ja.  In a nutshell, what has become apparent is that this letter has been used as a basis for the board decision in regard to the prepayment.     H’m.  We can see from your affidavit that you took part in the drafting of a submission that was given to the board in regard to that prepayment request for a prepayment decision.     Can you tell the Chairperson how did your involvement come about?     Yes, in regard to the email, we have asked whether you could provide us with those emails.     Could you obtain the emails?     Yes.  I just missed what you said about Dr Ngubane.  I could not hear you properly there.  He gave you a call...?     Yes?     Okay.  Because this is what I want to tell you.  In his affidavit, Dr Ngubane says in regard to this     So convening this meeting, was not your initiative.     Okay.  So a submission is prepared.  You prepare the submission.  Assist with information, you say you obtained from Mr Koko and Mr Anoj Singh.  And where does it get to be submitted?     Yes.     Requested an urgent meeting.     Thank you Chair.  You see, he carries on further and just listen to the picture of things ought to be painted here.   “So Ms Daniels request an urgent meeting on the basis of the letter Mr Matshela Koko had written to the DG of the Department of Mineral Resources on 6 December 2015 and the undated response of the DG and the copies are attached. The Company Secretary (he goes on to say) presented the memorandum dated 8 December 2015, dealing with the urgency of the matter.” And he attaches a copy as well.  So the impression created – and maybe he will clarify when he is here – is that you called the meeting, you then presented the memorandum in regard to that. Well, I suppose this memorandum is the submission that we are referring to here but it seems to be something that, on his version would have come from you, in your initiative, calling a meeting in submitting this memorandum. Did you sign the memorandum?     Yes.  So what did ...[intervenes]      Well, you can tell us from your recollection.  I will assist in regard to the – where you find the submission, if it is, page 281.     It was to...?     Ja, I think your mic is again not right and …[intervenes]     Yes.     Thank you, Chair.  Now that submission is on page 281, you confirm that is the submission?     Yes, it is    So who – so the intention here is to make a submission to the board motivating for the board to prepay for coal from Optimum.     Not from Tegeta.     Now paragraph 2 says    You mean the letter on page 276?     Ja, let us go to page 276 please.  The     But does it bear any relevance to the proposal to do a pre-purchase or prepayment?      Thank you, Chairperson.  That file you have has Dr Ramontja affidavit, but I will read to you what he says in regard to this 1.7 and maybe that is where the     Did you apply your mind to it at the time and maybe enquire as to why the board should be made to rely on this letter, because that is the first part of the submission under paragraph 2.     So we go back to that submission under Resolution Required.  They require... “It is hereby resolved that a request from the Department of Mineral Resources is hereby noted.”     281, Chairperson.     281.     And paragraph 2.1.2    “The Group Chief Executive together  with the Group Executive for Generation…” Who is that?     “...and Chief Financial Officer...”     Mr Anoj... “...are hereby authorised to negotiate and conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement with the proposed owners of OCM (Coal Supply)” Now what …[intervenes]     So is that consistent with what is said     Yes, but say more, is it conflicting, is it the same entity or what is going on here?     Ja, thank you, Chair.  Okay, so there is that – it is a confusion or inconsistency and it goes on.      Yes, Chair.     I do not think we have your draft versions.      In your affidavit.     Because this is …[intervenes]     No, Chair, we do not have them, the Commission does not have.     The [indistinct]16    Thank you, Chair.  So, Ms Daniel, I     “    Yes, so if one takes this paragraph, on the fact of it, it means that there is a proposal on the table by the business rescue practitioners of OCM and that proposal is supported by the DMR.  So that means what follows should be Eskom accepts that proposal.     And the end result should be that the transaction that is motivated here would be concluded with the business rescue practitioners because they are the ones who made the proposal which the DMR supports.     Looking at 2.2.2.     Ja.  Which then is still a puzzlement why 2.1.2 is worded the way it is worded because it envisages a pre-purchase from a different entity.     Ja.  And 2.2.3 says    Oh, you cannot hear me.     Did I fade in and out?     So which – where would you like me to repeat?  2.2.4, I was saying I do not understand that paragraph, I do not know whether it should detain us.  We can move on.     It what?     In what way?  In what respect?  Well, you know, let us do this first.       If you, just in a nutshell, explain to the Chairperson, this submission is about, as they say, a pre-purchase of coal from Optimum and it seems to be based on what they say, it is a proposal by the business rescue practitioner which proposal is supported by DMR in respect of, what they say, is a risk to the supply of coal to the Hendrina Power Station.  What is the solution to that risk?  Let us do a pre-purchase or – ja, they call it a pre-purchase of coal to the value of R1.6 billion. Now on the fact of it – well, on the one hand it is relevant so the submission looks at Optimum (Pty) Ltd, the business rescue practitioners, and he talks to that.  On the other hand, and tell me if I am correct because I am explaining this so that we understand it, on the other hand, that paragraph, which is 2.1.2 says it is a pre-purchase. “To negotiate and conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement for the proposed owners of OCM.” Now that is a different entity.  That will be Tegeta.       Is that explanation correct?     Then am I correct that one then is left with a confusion.  Is it correct that one then is left with a confusion?     This is - says to the identity of the party with whom this transaction is meant to be concluded.     Page 443.     Chair, we are looking at 2.2.1.     Yes.      Yes indeed Chair.     Thank you chair.     Thank you, thank you DCJ.   Ms Daniels we were dealing with the submission that was prepared.  Now we are at a stage of the preparation of the submission, the contents of the submission. This submission is prepared in order to be submitted.  Now we need to know from you is it to be submitted to the Board for discussion and decision making?     So, there was not going to be a meeting of the Board?     Now, this submission – I’ll come back to it, is being prepared on the 7 t h of December 2015.     That Round Robin decision took place when?     To the Board members?     And the Round Robin decision was made?     So, the Board members had one day notice?     Or one day opportunity to consider what was being submitted to them?     He didn’t draft the letter, Chairperson.     Yes, so the letter was given to him, he found it on his desk, and he said he read it, it made sense to him, he says because the DMR would sometimes intervene to help, especially where jobs are at risk and he signed the letter.     His signature yes.     Thank you, so Ms Daniels we were just trying to plot the timeline from the drafting to the submission or circulating of the submission to the Board members and to the decision making by the Board members.  So, they get the submission from you on the 8 t h?     And when you send a submission to them what do you indicate in terms of when the decision should  be made?     And can you recall on the 8 t h, when do you – time wise, when do you send the submission to them?     So, they would have had to have considered it overnight?     Make a decision.     By Round Robin on an R1.6billion?     Pre-payment?     Did any one of them raise concerns?     And what were – who are those?     And what were their concerns?      Did they reply?      I see that in his affidavit Mr Koko says, in regard to the drafting of the – oh no that’s the letter, I think he confirms, asking you to draft the letter on the 4 t h of December 2015, that’s the letter you draft, and it goes to the DMR.     The drafting of the submission itself, you say is on the 7 t h.  So, let’s – we were going through the contents of this submission and what we see, on the face of it, is the convolution and confusion in regard to the identity of the entity with whom to do this transaction.  If you recall, and I would like you to explain this to the Chairperson,  what was in the mind of – or what was explained to the Board when this submission is presented, what is explained, is the purpose for which this submission was made?     Yes, now that explanation, where does one find it, is it in an email or is it in this submission?     About the pre-payment to Tegeta?     To Optimum Coal Mine?    You’re saying it’s in this submission?      Yes, well there’s two things here, I’ve said the entities are seemingly confused – well not confused but it’s confusing in regard to the identity of the entities to conclude the transaction with.  What I want to understand, is your explanation to the Chairperson, what was explained to the Board, is the purpose of this submission, what is the Boar told and I appreciate that the Board is receiving this, is it by email?     The Board is going to decide by way of a Round Robin, correct?     So, the Board is not going to have a meeting to discuss this documentation submitted for it?      So, they’re going to, individually send you, in their approval of this documentation without having sat together to discuss it?      So, what is explained to the Board, when this document is submitted to it?     Now, what was explained as the reason for the urgency?     Was there documentation relied upon to validate that claim of the risk of coal supply?     I see that the only kind of factor relied upon is that OCM has gone into business rescue?     But does business rescue – a company being in business rescue prevent it from trading?     Yes, and isn’t it that, regarding what I’ve just asked you, that Tegeta itself was acquiring coal from OCM or Optimum Coal Mine in order to supply to Eskom.     You didn’t have direct knowledge of that?     Yes, so what I’m saying is, if Tegeta could buy from this mine, Optimum Coal Mine, no doubt Eskom could continue doing so, directly from the mine?     So, the reason that it was under business rescue was no reason at all for the purposes of this pre-payment?     Now, you know, we have seen, and I want you to just explain to the Chairperson, the evolution of this document with the amendments that get to be done to it, were you aware whether this document went outside of Eskom for commentary by some third party and, that is during the drafting process and then came back to be finalised with the changes that were made and given to you to submit to the Board?     Yes, Chair, if I may, in regard to this particular aspect I’d like Ms Suzanne Daniels to turn to page 443, that’s where we were relative to the first and the second version of the draft but now, I wanted to view it for a different purpose, 443, are you there Ms Daniels?     Something catches my eye on page 444, I see that – is that what you refer to as your first draft?     Yes, the heading under Executive Summary is Round Robin submission to the Investment and Finance Committee, IFC?     So why is that I thought this was a submission to the Board?     Did you…[intervenes].     Thank you Chair.  Now, how did that get to be changed?     Okay, that’s the version one is your page 444, is that correct?     So, the email – your email to Mr Koko is on page 443.  So, you say to him, “For your review and sign-off”, That’s Monday 7 December 2015 at 15h16.    So, the document you’re sending to him is on page 444.      So, the heading, it reflects to be submitted to the IFC and it requires, on page 447 paragraph 4,  “Other approvals required, Public Finance Management Act obtained from National Treasury and Department of Public Enterprise due to tenure and contract value”.     Then on page 448 there’s an email     That’s at 15h58, so you turn the page, the document is still addressed to IFC and it still has a requirement of Public Finance Management Act on page 452, paragraph 4.     It’s sent off to him, then you turn the page to 453, again still on the 7 t h of December 2015 at 16h40.  Now, please explain to the Chairperson, identify to the Chairperson what you see there?     What exactly is he saying?     Thank you Chair.  Did you – do you know how the draft submission would have landed with Mr Eric Wood and Businessman?     You only know from?     Yes, my question is, do you know it would have gone to them, this document?     The investigator doesn’t have an email to that effect.     That’s why I’m asking whether, do you know?     So, so far what we see from the emails is that it is you and Mr Koko exchanging the draft.     So, either you or he could have sent it out?     Did you send it out?     Were you aware of this email at the time?     Okay, so I want to…[intervenes].     Correct, Chairperson, infoportal1.     Ms Daniels, then – well on the draft on page 454 I see still there’s IFC, so IFC hasn’t been removed and on page 457 under paragraph 5 it still has a PFMA, National Treasury required, approval required.  So, it seems by this time, it hasn’t come back to you?     Did you, in fact, do the changes from IFC to Board, did you, ultimately, do those changes?     Does your final draft – well who made the final draft?     Signed?     So that came to you, turn to page 486.     Are you there, yes please identify the document?     But this is now on Tuesday 8 December 2015?    At 16h40.      So, by this time, this document has not been submitted to the Board?     Its forwarding to you, the email below.     So, the email below is also from Mr Matshela Koko, Tuesday December 8, 2015 at 3h57pm it sent to – or addressed to Mr Anoj Singh and the subject is the 2015/12/08 RRR Optimum Coal Mine Pty Ltd final and then he says, “Boss please receive the attached, signed documents, best regards”, There at the top then it gets forwarded to you.     Is that the document on the next page?     So, the last one then is a Round Robin submission to Board of Directors.     No longer to IFC?     And that paragraph 4 of PFMA requirement?     And the document is signed by Mr Koko on 8 December 2015?     Is that the document or submission you finally circulated to Board members?     I see…[intervenes].     Yes, I want to go slightly back – a little back, I see on…[intervenes].    Thank you.  Ja Ms Daniels because even the draft is in that order.  Mr Singh is first and then Mr Matshela Koko is last which is what the Chairperson is saying.  Normally the – the junior people will sign first and pass it on to the most senior person who will be the last to sign.  After the document is submitted to him and it is explained this is what it means and he is satisfied then he signs.  That is the point he made.  But you would have known who is senior – more senior than the others surely.  Ms Daniels seeing as the Chief Financial Officer would have been more senior?    Yes.    Let us go slightly back to page 459?     Page 459.  So it is after that email from Businessman is I want – I want – now this man wants it.  It is not may I suggest – I want the PFMA approval.  Part removed.    Yes Chair I was saying it after that email.  Let us go to 459.  Let us go to 459?  459 it is on the 8    And he writes   Well you are not copied there so you – would you have had knowledge of this exchange?    Then there is the – I am not sure whether this is version 3 on page 468 because he still has IFC and he still has paragraph 4.  But it did not come to you?  Well you are not copied in that email.    And go to page 464.  There are emails there and the bottom one is the one we have read between    Then we go up and the middle of the page there is another email from – it is Polly.    Now I cannot pronounce that name Visenet.     “On behalf of Anoj Singh.”    The 8 December 2015 11   So Polly is an employee at Eskom?    This time – is a PA – well I do not know is he a PA – is she?    Executive Assistant.    Oh I see.  So sending the document to Regiments.    Now does Regiments have anything to do with this document?    Financial certification.    Verification.    Give us the page number?    Oh under paragraph 3.7?    Now let us go back to page 64…    It is 491 – 497 yes.  He is saying under paragraph 3.7 “Regiments Capital Propriety Limited is indicated there as verification by independent party.”    Yes.  Ms Daniels let us go back to page 464.  And now did you know about Regiments as you go back to page 464?    Ja.  Ah because I see on page 463 under the paragraph 3.7 verification by independent party they say not applicable there.    But what was to be verified if there was anything to be verified?  What does that entail?    Was it applicable here?    Okay but just think about it.    Here is a submission for a pre-payment to be made. Eskom wants to make a pre-payment R1.6 billion.  What need – what – how does verification come to play – come into play there?    I want you to help us understand.    Ja.  So this document is sent to Regiments on the 8t h remember you said you would have sent the document to the board members on that day for a Round Robin resolution the next day.  I do not know how much of verification – how much is required in the verification process?    Yes.  So let us – let us move on.  I see on page 469 this – at the top of the page – at the bottom is the same emails we have read – at the top you get Boitumelo Mapasa which is the one at Regiments on the 8 December 15 and she sends the email to Eric Wood and cc’d Mohammed Bobat.  Did you know these persons and – sorry just before you answer it seems to be forwarding version 3 of the document received from Polly.  You see that?    Did you know Mr Eric Wood and Mohammed Bobat?    Did you know them after this transaction?    Turn to page 474.  There is another email there.  474 you see that?    From Mr Mohammed Bobat Tuesday 8    Anytime thereafter?    So you do not know this person at all?    You would not know in which company she is?    You turn that page then there is an executive summary which on the face of it would have been what was being exchanged and it has some track changes from track changes and one of which is on page 478 and there is a comment there against paragraph 4.  The comment    You see that.  So whoever included this comment here seems to have known what Businessman wanted.    And on page 480 please identify the document?    So that 15   On page 486.  Just shortly after that 3   Well it has…    Sorry …    Yes Chair.    Oh the page for the board decision.  I have not reached there yet Chair.    Yes.    No.    No you are – you are on track Chair.  Ms Singh – Ms Daniels – I beg your pardon.  You then – do we have your email to the board?  But anyway you send this submission to the board.  It seems to be in the evening of    At 16   From Mr Koko.    Yes Chair.    At 486 yes.    That is correct Chair.    It comes to you and then at 492 – at 492 you get the one signed.  What are you – what is this – what is that email at page 492?    Well is this not the first time you are getting a request for a Round Robin by the board?    Not for the IFC.    Because the document has now changed from IFC to the board.    Because Businessman said I want it to be submitted to the board.    Not IFC.    It comes from Maya Barnard.  Please tell the Chairperson who is she?    Of Mr Anoj Singh.    And this is now the final signed document?    And you are being asked to assist with a Round Robin to the board.    Now on page 498 we see that same email from Ms Barnard – Maya Barnard but then at the top of the    Oh.  Now explain this because I thought the Chairperson had asked you to convene – to assist in the drafting and to convene a board meeting on the 7t h the day before?    So was there a response to your email?  I see you have turned the page to 499.      Yes.    Yes but he is not answering your question?    You think you would have had a telephone.    Talk with her.  So thereafter you have sent that to the board?    524.      Yes that is an email Tuesday 8 December    But you did say Ms Verushni Naidoo    Was that done?    On the 9 December you convened an IFC meeting?    So when would they have been notified that there should be a meeting?    On the 8t h?    I see there are emails on page 537.      Did you say 545?    No my apologies I got the sequence incorrect.    Yes I have referred you to 537 – 537.    Is it a duplication?  Ja you can pick up the sequence – let us see – okay are you looking for the email where you notifying the IFC members?    Yes.    Yes, no I think it was the page you had referred the Chairperson to.    Yes.    Yes so that was page – well I see it on page 4 – I mean 549.    Page 549 where she writes to you 8    Just one point before I move on.  Was it your email where you asked is the Chairperson aware of this to Mr Singh and Mr Koko and Boitumelo.  But then you when    Ja.  The reason I am asking you that is because you saw in his affidavit.    This morning he says you convened that meeting.    So on page 550 Kassiem or Kasim.  I think you have referred to this earlier.       Twenty-eight minutes past nine.  And she is writing to you and Mr Anoj, asking questions there.  You say these questions were answered?     Page 552.     552.     Oh, is this – is this email – because you need to identify it first – is this email an answer to Ms Kasim?     But it comes on the 9t h of December at nine minutes past nine.       When did IFC meet?     And for how long did they meet?     And how did the meeting take place?     So the meeting was no in person?     Did anyone of them complain about the short notice, extremely short notice given?     Who are the members of IFC?     Ja.  Did you arrange the telephone conference?     Now the outcome – just give me the time again.  Date?     Okay.  So this – if you took about 30-minutes, these answers would have come after the fact.     The outcome of IFC, what was it?     Yes.  Did you keep the minutes of IFC?     Let us see.  Turn to page 584.  Or 582.  It seems to be the same thing.  Let us see.  You will tell me.  Page 582 has a watermark Draft on it and then there is 584.       Are you there?     Did you look at the two – the documents on those two pages?     Yes.  So I see that then...  Ja, the     So they have approved...  Anything more on this IFC outcome?     Yes, you say it is in your affidavit?     Let us see.  Chairperson, it is on page 286.  Page 286.       You found it Ms Daniels?     You say the salient points.  Anything of significance here you wish to draw to Chairperson’s attention?  Sorry, the document, just for purposes of identification is dated 9 December 2015.  Eskom Board of Directors, IFC proceedings, December 2015.       The title is    Yes.     Which paragraph number were you reading from?     Number three.  Well, let me read this     Yes. “...approved and will support and allow OCM to migrate from the status of business rescue to that of a growing concern.” Now OCM here cannot be Tegeta.       Because Tegeta is under business rescue.     Yes?     Yes. “...to migrate on the status of business rescue to that of a growing concern. Their full rights, responsibilities and accountabilities will be as per the Companies Act. They plan to use the pre-purchase proceeds to address their now liability and liquidity challenges. This will be a positive development, both for OCM and for Eskom, which will address the present day contractual obligations and create a platform for the future sustainability of mutual trade, business and job continuity for fellow South Africans. 2. Despite of the proposed solution, OCM undertakes to increase their transformation accountability and responsibility from 30% to 51% ownership.  This is a positive development.  It is noted and acknowledged.” And I will leave three which I have read.  Paragraph 4     Glencore was the owner of Optimum Coal Holdings.     Which was a holding company of Optimum Coal Mine.     Did you see this note?     So this note related to Glencore?     And Optimum?     So in the mind of IFC, this resolution for the prepayment of coal was in relation to Optimum?     And not Tegeta?     Did the board see this?     Because I have seen the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, Ms Viroshini Naidoo says she never received the IFC outcome from you.     She specifically asked for it?     Now Ms Daniels, this meeting of IFC ends at nine ...[intervenes]      09    Yes.  Then there was Ms Naidoo saying    Yes.     So when...  Or you want to answer first?  Let me give you a chance to answer.     Ja.  Now, can you recall?  When do you receive a response from the board members in regard to this particular submission?  And I am now talking now the date and the time.      Sorry, I am missing there?     Oh, the one where she approves herself?     Yes.  That is on the 8t h?     Page 571.     But then if she approved and she asked that it be considered by IFC, it would have been a formality for her to receive if the outcome from IFC?     Because she has already registered their approval.     On the 9t h?     That is the day thereafter, after the 8t h.     Chairperson, that is page 569.     So he approves four minutes before eleven at night.       Dr Ngubane sends his approval at 08    IFC is in session.     His is at page 571.     Yes.  The one at 569 is Dr Pat Naidoo’s.     Yes.  And then the one of Mr Romeo Khumalo.     On page 572.  Did Ms Pat Naidoo also approved this?     No, no.  Sorry.  Mr Mark Pamensky.     So even at board level, he did not take part in the voting?     In the approval.     So then by the time IFC is...  Well, I do not know whether they deliberated on this.  They are busy in a tender conference and the chairperson is Mr Pat Naidoo because Mr Mark Pamensky has excused himself.  Mr Pat Naidoo has already sent you his approval the night before.  He is chairing IFC the next morning but the decision is already made.     Ja.  So what happens to this R 1.68 billion?     Ja.  Just before that conversion.  What did the board decide on the execution of its decision to prepay OCM and Dr Pat Naidoo suggesting, let us do a joint statement.  Chairman of Eskom and chairman of Glencore.  How is that – or was that executed?     And what did the board decide on the execution of the prepayment?     Was...?     Yes.  How did they execute it now?     Well, what was the board resolution?  Maybe I should ask you that.     Give us the page number, please?     577.  Thank you.     Yes.  So was that done?     This is to execute on the prepayment?     Does this not execute on the prepayment?     Yes, I am asking whether that execution was done?  Was the prepayment made?     Yes, what happened?     Did you know who did that?     Did he instruct you?     So that is exactly the next day?     Did that, what do you call it, conversion for a lack of a better word, from a cash to a guarantee go back to the board?     No, did it go back to the board on the 9t h?     Yes, you wanted to say, it went to the board, when?     December ...[intervenes]      Ms Daniels, the guarantee – the cash is converted into a guarantee.  And I hear you venture an answer about the safety relative to that but the question is.  In whose favour was the guarantee issued?     Yes.  Ms Daniels, which underlying agreement is that?  Which are the parties to the agreement?     Okay.  But does it matter?  Because the approval of the prepayment is made in relation to Glencore and OCM.       The guarantee which piggy backs on the approval is suddenly made in favour of Tegeta.     Now go back to the first resolution which relates to the prepayment before OCM.     There is the underlying agreement between Tegeta and Eskom matter for that decision.     So that is why...  You want to carry on?     Yes.     Yes.  So if it does not matter, it makes everything about the guarantee irrelevant.  Irrelevant to the decision made by IFC and the by the board on the 9t h of December 2015.     That guarantee is irrelevant.     It is not made by the board.  It not made by Eskom.  It is made by Mr Anoj Singh.     And he is making it in favour of a completely different entity.     Chairperson, that guarantee is on page 599.     So then this guarantee would have been given for an ulterior motive or purpose.     Well, we have learnt from the evidence that the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, that it would have been issued to assist Tegeta to show that it has the money to pay for the price, by the purchase price of OCM.     It...  Did you know ...[intervenes]      Is he not effective 1 August 2015?  I think it is effective 1 August 2015.  I am not sure.     He is seconded to act effective 1 August 2015.     So this is August.  September, October, November, in December this is what is happening.     In that six – that’s three months, ja, a little over three months now.     Ms Nonkululeko Veleti.     Yes.     That is right, Chair.  Is that correct, Ms Daniels?     Ja, I cannot recall exactly when.     Yes.     Yes, that is [indistinct] 01.52 because we have done – the 1.6 billion prepayment approval which is taken on short notice, the next day is converted into a guarantee by the CFO, all on his own, and in favour of a different entity than the one contemplated in the previous board decision.  Then there is the prepayment of 659 million, I believe that is the next thing you deal with in your affidavit.      And it is common cause the board made that decision, Ms Daniels, I think you have – your part is relating to the Chairperson, to the Commission, the role played in the build-up to the making of that decision because it also starts with the submission and now we are on – we are now in April 2016 and you can tell the Chairperson briefly what happens.     That is from page 255, through the whole file. Chair, while Ms Daniels goes there …[intervenes]     Yes.  There is an affidavit recently submitted to the Commission by Mr Pierce Marsden who was …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     I have, I have.     I just wanted to read a portion from his affidavit which relates to the statement made in Dr Ramontja’s letter about the rehabilitation – well, it is actually made in his affidavit about rehabilitation.     Ms Daniels, yes, I had asked a question, we are going now into the prepayment of the 560 – no, 659 million.     Beg your pardon.  Again you were asked to do a submission.     Yes, Chair.     That is in order, Chairperson.     Thank you Chair.   Ms Daniels there’s a question which I recall I needed to ask you and that is in regard to the guarantee.  Remember the guarantee is made on the 10 t h of December 2015.  Do you know how ...[intervenes]      Was there any agreement in writing between Eskom and Tegeta relative to the guarantee?     Okay when you say underlying you mean the guarantee would have been issued in contemplation of that agreement.     Or on the strength of it.      Now did you take part in the drafting of that agreement?     Who, who asked you to draft the agreement?     Yes, on page 7, 73, page 7, 73.     There are emails there, can you just quickly identify them to the Chairperson.   From bottom up.     Yes, well is that the agreement on page 774.     It runs up to page 776, it is unsigned so that is a draft.     And Mr Anoj, the email above yours?     That is on 10 December 2015 at 4    Then there is an email above?     So that email is on the 10 t h December     Now what was the time, I said 16    724.  Are you there?     Please identify the document.     Yes this email is on the 10 t h of December 2015, and it is at fifteen minutes past twelve, after midnight, is that correct?    Yes, that is what is confusing me because it is 10 December 2015 at just after half past seven sent to you, that will be 10 December in the morning.      Yes, so this is an email from Businessman to Matshela email address 10, Matshela2010.     No, I know that it is his personal email address.     There is an email above from Matshela2010@yahoo.com sent to you, Suzanne Daniels, forwarding the two pager.     So you know that you know that you received this from Mr Koko?     Yes.  So would this have preceded the drafting of the coal supply agreement, what you have referred to as the underlying agreement?      Just turn the page to 725, see whether that doesn’t relate to what you are talking about.     Yes.  So what were you asking there?     Yes, I see that the attachments is instruction two pager between Tegeta and Eskom, which seems to be similar to the emails on the previous page which also is the subject of a two-pager.     So does it mean that Businessman would have attached a document to his email address, which is two-pager, forwarded to your by Mr Matshela Koko, which then gets forwarded further to CDH, Mr Rishaban Moodley of CDH.   Is that what is happening here?     And if one looks at the body of the email – well I don’t, maybe he didn’t attach anything, Businessman on page 724, if you look at the body of his email he says two-pager between Tegeta and Eskom salient points, Eskom will provide bank guarantee for R1.68billion.  This is Businessman and then he writes CP – what does CP stand for, CP for release is?     Okay condition precedent for release is one, Section 11 approval from DMR, two Competition Commission approval.  Now let’s pause there for a moment, let’s go to page 726.  Could that have been the document annexed to your email to Mr Moodley of CDH?     So it says ...[intervenes]      So you send it to the attorneys, I need your assistance in drafting this agreement, so page 726 says two-pager between Tegeta and Eskom, salient points.  That’s exactly what Businessman wrote, two pager between Tegeta and Eskom salient points.   Eskom will issue bank guarantee in favour of Tegeta for R1.6billion on signature, so that is the same bullet point as his except on signature is there, a faction effective date, and then CP for release is which is also how he wrote it.  The first bullet point under there is Section 11 approval from DMR which is exactly the same as his.   Next bullet point is Competition Commission approval which is also the same as his, and there are other aspects added to the draft, notarial bond on future coal company secretary to issue letter of comfort that that shares have been transferred and issued to new owner, and lawyers letter of comfort that the CP’s have been fulfilled, do you see that?     Are the rest of the bullet points the same as the one in Businessman, ja it seems to be the same.     If you look at the last bullet point Chairperson any amount due over R130million for each month shall be payable to Tegeta.  The one above that, therefore if Tegeta does not deliver full volume from OCM or Kroon the payments due for Brakfontein can be clawed, exactly the same.  Go to the one above, Tegeta receiving prepayment for two mines supply but Eskom can use monies owed from three mines, Brakfontein also to recoup the R140million a month. Exactly the same.  So somebody else was drafting his own terms for Eskom, for you guys.     Did you see this email which was forwarded to you by Mr Matshela Koko on page 724?   Is this email being forwarded to you?     Thank you.  Did you express any view, not view but was this of any – did it raise any concern to you that it is an email from Businessman that is assuming you don’t know who is Businessman, does it raise any concerns for you, questions, queries, where does this come from?     Thank you Chair.   Ms Daniels this is in December 2015 did you have an idea in December 2015 as to who Businessman was or could be in December 2015?     You had your suspicion?     What was your suspicion?     It was Businessman.      Chairperson so where the name – it is essentially the same, so where you see the email address it is Infoportal, but then sometimes you see the name.    Other times you see both.    Businessman then infoportal.    Yes the same Chair.    Ja.    Please yes.    Thank you Chair because relative to Dr Ngubane Ms Daniels he was saying you told him he is Richard Seleke and you said he was the one who told you that is Richard Seleke.  I am wondering what is Mr Matshela’s version going to be?  I understand he says you gave him the email.    Affidavit.    Yes.  Quickly you know the email exchanges ultimately also goes to explicit Mr salimessa@gmail.com page 752 as well as page – well let us deal look at 752.  There is Mr Anoj Singh on 10 December    “Please find above attached.” And that email seems to have been forwarded – oh it goes to Eric Wood of Regiments and Eric Wood at the top of the page forwards it to salimessa@gmail.com.   And you turn to    Ja.  If you did not stand up based on your duties I suppose you knew them very well as a Company Secretary.  This board who was going to advise it if you were silence who was going to advise this board?    Yes.  Ms Daniels I want to conclude with this.  I saw another email there where you tell Mr Anoj Singh that you have not put the expiry date for the fulfilment of conditions of the CP’s.  That expiry date was ultimately 31 March 2016.  Who placed that date?    For the fulfilment of the…    Were you aware that at the same time as this was happening that Tegeta had signed an agreement with – in fact it signed on that day the 10 December 2015 signed an agreement with Optimum or Glenco for the purchase of Optimum Coal Holdings and that that agreement    Do you know what was the date for the fulfilment of those conditions?    Well when you became aware?    It coincided with the same date.    31 March 2016.    Ja that will lead us to the pre-payment on your return.    Thank you Chair.    Well I understand that..    Yes.     Thank you Chair.

MS DANIELS:  No.    Yes.    So help me God.    Yes please Mr Chairperson.    May I please make a few remarks it will not take long before we start?    It should not be…    It should not be that long.    Thank you Chairperson. Thank you for the opportunity to make a few remarks before I deal with the questions. I appreciated right from the start that going public with my disclosures on state capture at Eskom would bring both positive and negative feedback.  Since making my disclosures I have been maligned and attacked as a disgruntled opportunist seeking some form of redemption. What is particularly galling is that the parties who have set out to crucify me and paint me as the villain are part of the crew who in fact are beneficiaries of the proceeds of state capture. What I did not realise is how close being a whistle blower is to being a scapegoat.  It would appear from my treatment that unless you are a whistle blower who has made exactly zero mistakes you are likely to become an object of scorn. Very few whistle blowers are pristine.  Very few of us carry a halo and yet we try to do the right thing and expose wrongdoings even when some of the exposure may have affect our own reputations. When I made my disclosures I admitted to the errors I have made and explained their contents.  My admissions are a mark against my name that has served those with far greater culpability in the wrongdoing at Eskom very well. There are people with greater power than me.  People who unlike me benefitted from their actions.  These are people who now use Suzanne Daniels as a scapegoat for their wrongdoing. I have nothing.  I have lost everything.  I may not be able to work in my profession again.  Financial and professional ruin is often the lot of whistle blowers.  Not to speak of death threats and constant fear.  My daughter is now abroad because of the threats we received. When the drivers testified here before the commission Mr Chairperson my blood ran cold when they repeated the messages they received. I received those same messages verbatim only difference was mine was anonymous.  The other threats I mentioned the last time I testified.  I watched Mr Koko’s testimony here before the commission last week and I was stunned at how matters unfolded.  He made a number of spurious allegations that went unchallenged as they did not make their way into his affidavit. Chairperson Mr Koko has sought in this commission to insinuate and it was I rather than him who was the link between Mr Essa’s designs and various nefarious decisions at Eskom. However smoothly he talked anyone who knows or has dealt with Mr Koko knows this to be untrue.  Listening to him seeking to advance his version with selective anecdotes and unrelated events I could only think of the remark of a prominent former investigative journalist.  I will put his remark a little bit more delicately.  He said Mr Koko was Mr Essa’s indentured servant.  Or maybe pet comes closer to the original remark because they communicated all the time like a boss micromanaging an underling. And those of us lower down the chain of command were all prevailed upon or manipulated or misled in various ways to ensure that Mr Koko’s true principles were satisfied. I have alerted the commission and other institutions to the extent of Mr Koko and Mr Essa’s communications which proves the depth of their relationship.  I do not have this proof myself in the form of call logs or memory caches or data usage.  I do not have the power to obtain those kinds of records. But the commission presumably has the power to obtain these records and thus to readily corroborate what I say about Mr Koko being the true conduit for Mr Essa and Gupta instructions into Eskom. In addition evidence of emails, overseas trips and meetings at the Saxonwold compound have emerged through various sources and I wish to make particular reference to Mr Koko’s testimony before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee. In that testimony Mr Koko confirmed  1. That he knew Mr Essa. 2. That he had visited Mr Essa at his offices at Melrose Arch. 3. That he had actually had a meeting with Mr Essa to discuss the Trillian payments. So other Eskom rollers have – sorry – other Eskom role players have testified here like Dr Ngubane and Ms Klein and I am sure more will appear in the coming days all were in the positions of power far greater than to that which I ever held. The all had far more to gain than me whether financially or by way of power from the bad decisions made at Eskom.  By virtue of my role these decisions flowed through – flowed past or through me and for this reason I am a handy scapegoat for some of them. What also unites these people is the treatment at this commission.  While their testimony with all due respect Chairperson attracted mainly geniality and chuckles and questions that provided a platform for their version to credibly emerge my own prior experience here is different. My testimony plainly provoked incredulity in you very pointed cross-examination and even statements that indicated free judgments. These are obviously my subjective views Chairperson and I do not want to play the victim. I welcome the interrogation and I accept that you may descend into the arena however when my accusers or higher social and political rank than me do not also get the same hard ball questions this leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Their stories plainly provided the same openings for interrogation and an impeachment and yet none who faced insistent requests that they concede that their versions conflicted with their duties or common sense.  You have an extremely difficult job Chairperson and I ascribe no ill-tent or personal biased to you at all but we cannot have a situation where witnesses on different scales of the same dispute of facts receives such a disparate treatment from the bench which is my impression of my situation.  To conclude my own evidence about Mr Koko’s role and the suspected role of other people in facilitating Mr Essa and the Gupta interests of Eskom here at Eskom can be corroborated by me. But I hope that just as much as the commission has quite inter-harshly interrogated my version of events it will also energetically use its powers to corroborate my version also. Thank you for listening.    Thank you Mr Chairman as I said thank you for allowing me to speak.    It is not intended to be a debate Mr Chairman I – sorry I – it was not intended to be a debate or anything I was just expressing my subjective view.    Okay.  I was not intending it to be a debate Mr Chairperson it was just my subjective view.    I do not concede…    Yes.    Okay thank you.    Yes I am there.     Yes I am there.    Yes I confirm that is my signature.    Yes that is the correct date.    Yes that is my affidavit.    Mr Chairman I first become involved in the developments that would culminate in the decision by the board say at the 1.68 million to Tegeta.    And that was in and around November 15.    Oh.     Mr Chairman, I became involved in the developments that we had that culminated in a decision by the board to prepay R 1.68 billion to Tegeta in and around November 2015.     Yes, Mr Chairman.  At the time, I held the position of Company Secretary to which I had been appointed on the 1s t of October 2015.       [No audible reply]      October 2015.  I had to ...[intervenes]      Yes.     That is correct.     Yes, Mr Chairperson that is in accordance with how I understood happenings to have unfolded.     Mr Chairperson, I think the first point of entry for me was a meeting of the 24 t h of November 2015.  Mr Koko asked me to attend a meeting.  It was between the Optimum – he said it was between Eskom and the Optimum Business Rescue Practitioners and his specific request was to ask me to take minutes because it was going to be a particularly important meeting.  Can you hear me?     Okay.  So this meeting took place on about...  In fact, it takes place on the 24t h of November.  The record shows, 24 November 2015.  At this meeting, I played no role.   There were – I, other than to take minutes, and I compared my notes with Ms Nteta, who was the Coal Supply Manager.  She was also present.   For me, at this meeting, it was my first encounter with the Oakbay representatives, Mr Nazeem Howa and Ms Ronica Ragavan were present together with Mr Twala.  They represented Oakbay.   Mr Marsden was there from the Optimum Business Rescue Practitioners and there was also a representative from Glencore but I could not recall his name but it is in the minutes that he was there, and Mr Shaun Blankfield.   For me the meeting was significant in – it was at this meeting that Mr Koko raised expectation on the part of Eskom that for the sale of Optimum Mine as a – that the sale of Optimum as a single entity would not be acceptable to Eskom. In the structure that Mr Seleka explained, there was a holding company and Optimum Mine was actually run as a subsidiary of Optimum Coal Holdings.   So there were other resources in the Optimum stable and Mr Koko mentioned these.  He emphasised that, you know, that it would be more acceptable to Eskom that Optimum Coal Holdings become the object of the sale. Amongst them, was Koornfontein Mine which was also another source of supply to Eskom.  They produced high-quality coal at this stage.   At the point of this meeting Mr Chairman, to the best of my knowledge, you know, the matter had not actually served before the board in the manner brought here with the acquisition of Optimum Coal Holdings.  So this was a new event.  In fact, it was also new to the Oakbay representatives because they pointed out that they did not have a mandate to discuss that and that they would have to go back to their and they would discuss it with the Business Rescue Practitioners later that day, which I understand...     That was my understanding from the meeting Mr Chairman.     Yes, that is correct Mr Chairperson.     [No audible reply]      Mr Howa responded that they did not have a mandate to discuss the purchase of Optimum Coal Holdings and that they needed to reconvene with the Business Rescue Practitioner.   In my notes it said that he would have to get a mandate from his board to discuss it with the Business Rescue Practitioner.     The next time I get involved is on about the 4t h of December.     Of December 2015.  My apologies.     Ja.     Mr Koko then requested me – he was Group Executive Generation – he requested me to assist him with the drafting of the correspondence to the Director General of Mineral Resources and the document should have been titled Optimum Coal Mine (Pty) Ltd, our supply to Hendrina Power Station.       I cannot recall.  I was at the office at that time.  I think the 4t h of December might have been the Friday afternoon.     To draft correspondence for him.     Yes, I did.     It was really – set out in broad terms what he wanted to say to the Director General.  He wanted to make the Director General aware of the challenges Eskom was facing in respect of the coal supply to Eskom.   And the other supply risk that Eskom was facing and he was not clear on the type of assistance that he wanted the DMR to lend to Eskom. And what I can say is, what initially started out as a reference to Hendrina ultimately included the supply challenges faced at Amot and Komati Power Station as well.       Yes, I can.     This is the letter addressed to Dr Thibedi Ramontja, the Director General of the Department of Mineral Resources and it was signed by Mr Koko on the 6t h of December 2015 and this was the final version of the letter that I had prepared.     That I had prepared.       For Mr Koko, yes.     It was not clear at the time Mr Chairman what he sought to achieve.  It was – ja, he just – end of the     At the time, he did not really answer the question.  I did ask him but he did not answer the question.      Yes, that is correct Mr Chairman.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes.     [No audible reply]      Yes, please.     [No audible reply]      My apologies.       Yes, he spoke about the transfer of the mineral(?) on an urgent basis.  It also spoke about a financial provision due to the historical liabilities and its holding levels for Optimum Coal Holdings, and it then spoke about driving transformation.  I think I just need to real the whole sentence.   “In return for the new owners honouring the current contract up to 2018 and for driving transformation, we would like to propose that consideration be made for some prepayment to be made for up to one year of coal supply, understanding the upfront capital injections to be made, ...[indistinct] to meet coal prior requirements from these mines.” [Speaker not clear.]     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that I confirm in my affidavit.     Mr Chair, roundabout the – I think it was the 7t h of December 2015, I received a call from Dr Ngubane, who was the chairman of the board at the time, with an instruction to convene a meeting and this was the executives, Mr Koko and Mr Singh in preparing the necessary documentation for circulation of the board.   At that stage, he was not specific as to what the contents of the submission was going to be about but he told me to speak to the executives.  The correspondence between the DMR would eventually become part of that board submission pack. After the call with Dr Ngubane, Mr Koko did request me to prepare the necessary paperwork for the board’s submission and consideration, and it was headed...  I am just trying to... I am just trying to find the copy on the...  It was the –     I did not ...[intervenes]      I did not have all the emails Mr Chairman.  What I did have, I think, we compared what the Commission has and what I have.  So it shows the various drafts.  Where there are not replies, that is when I say, you know, there were telephone exchanges.       He gave me a call roundabout the 7t h of December.     And he asked me to convene a meeting of the board.     No, Mr Chairman I would not call the meeting.  The meeting would be...  I mean, as the Company Secretary, the meeting would be the prerogative of the board, the chairperson. So I would – Dr Ngubane definitely called me to say     No, it was not my initiative.     That is correct Mr Chair.     And you know, given the time of the year, it would have been very difficult to do unscheduled meetings.     No, I did not sign the memorandum Mr Chairman.  It was signed by Mr Singh in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer and it was signed by Mr Koko as the Group Executive for Generation.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     Mr Chairman, I think that is one conception that one needs to debunk, the company secretary is a not a member of the board, has no voting powers.  My function was to ensure the smooth – so it is a very high level technical clerical role in one aspect and it would ensure that the meeting is run sufficiently, that they run smoothly, that the minutes are taken and that meetings are convened at the request of the Chairman particularly.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, I had been asked, you know, in the course of my – in my duties to get – obviously either advise on governance issues or obtain legal opinion, etcetera, which came later.     Can I refer to the submission?     I think, in just high level terms, Mr Chairman, it was to negotiate and conclude the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Mine.     What the submission says, it was to negotiate and conclude a pre-purchase of coal agreement for the proposed owners of Optimum Coal Mine.     Did you hear me?     Mr Seleka, just continue?     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct. ADV SELEKA     So in essence it was to prepay for coal.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     Not from Tegeta.     This was the request to consider payment of R1.7 billion upfront, as you would have seen in the letter     The letter on page 276, it says    From my understanding and experience, Mr Chairman, of coal contracts, this was the provision that needed to be made for environmental rehabilitation.  So, you know, as miners progress in the mining they have to make provision for rehabilitation at the end of the mine and as concurrent.  So that was my understanding of this sentence.     I think …[intervenes]     No, there is no reference but, you know, having looked at the documents now, with the benefit of hindsight, that was the hook that was used to motivate for the prepayment because you would then see …[intervenes]     Well, it talks about R1.7 billion and then it talks about providing support for the project to succeed     In my submission this had nothing to do with the prepayment.     Mr Chairman, at the time I really did not interrogate the letter to that degree.  I have had the benefit of hindsight and you will see it in my affidavit of sitting down and, you know, actually looking at the – also at the request of the Commission and the questions, looking at the submissions and releasing that it actually did not make any sense.     Yes at the time the Group Chief Executive, Mr Singh was acting, Mr Molefe was off sick.     That was Matshela Koko.     That was Anoj Singh.     Yes.     No, that is not consistent.     Sorry, Mr Seleka, I did not …[intervenes]     I drafted versions 1 and 2 and  - well, each version would be sent to Mr Koko and Mr Singh.  They would come back additions.  This final version that was signed, there were additions that I did not make but it was already signed off by them.  So there was no opportunity  to change things.  You will see that one it is signed by the executives I do not second-guess them.     I do not – I do not have that …[intervenes]     I am not sure we have …[intervenes]     In the bundle.     Ja.     I do have them but they are not in the bundle.     Yes, I do have them somewhere.     No, I think we did have it in our consultation, Mr Chairman.     I would not remember the minutiae of the detail.  I think it would be, you know, unfair to put them before you.     No, it was not correct.     Yes, I see that but that – that was not reflected in the correspondence in that way.     Yes.     That is correct.     Just looking at 2.2.2.     But – ja, that is correct.     Mr Chairman, I am having the same problem hearing, I cannot hear Mr Seleka.     Sorry, you fade in and out.     Apologies.     I think the executive summary is explained in sort of Section 3 and then I also analysed in my affidavit.  So I think if your questions are does this make sense, as I said in my affidavit, it does not make sense.     It does not make sense.     Okay.     Yes.     Yes, that is a succinct way of looking at it, Mr Chair.      Yes, that is correct.     Yes because OCM, Optimum Coal Mine business rescue practitioner is used quite loosely.     Yes, I can.     No, I think …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes, that is correct, Mr Chair, but I do want to point out that I actually explain in more detail and it is a bit clearer that it is the new owners of Optimum Coal Mine.     Yes.     Those were my instructions at the time, Mr Chairman, and the manner in which I phrased it here …[intervenes]     I said those were my instructions at the time.     From Mr Koko and Mr Singh.  And …[intervenes]     I don’t ...[intervenes]      Ja I don’t think I raised the issue at the time Mr Chairman.     Ja, it is against the backdrop of the meeting of the 24 t h of November.     There was mention, or the premise of the meeting at the time was the purchase of OCM.     So that was the only link at this time in the process of drafting, because there was discussions about buying OCM.     I understand that, and you know in retrospect one would say you now that should have been the position.  I think because of the meeting of the 24 t h of November, you know just the letter of DMR aside, if you look at it, the discussion at that meeting was the parties were already undertaking a due diligence, they wanted to complete this by a particular date in the future but as it progressed you now those documents were not – these documents then don’t support that, and that’s why I am saying with the benefit of hindsight when you look at the documentation provided to support his position they don’t really tie up, and that’s what I say?     It was because it was a Round Robin it was decision making.     No, it subsequently became a Round Robin discussion, I mean a Round Robin approval because members of the Board were not available to meet.     That is correct.    I sent out the documents on the 8 t h of December.      To the Board members.     On the 9 t h of December.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman.     Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman.     No, not at that stage, it just looked like consideration for the pre-payment.     Yes, that is correct, Mr Chair.     I think it was the next day by midday if possible.     It was in the afternoon.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct, Mr Chairman.     Yes.     There were two Board members that sent questions, Mr Chairman.     That was Ms Viroshini Naidoo and Ms Mariam Cassim.     I think in Ms Viroshini Naidoo’s case she approved the submission, the first line of the email said I approve but please ensure that this goes to the IFC, which is the Investment and Finance Committee, is it within – you know make sure that we adhere to the PFMA approvals and does this need DPE approval, which is The Department of Public Enterprises.  Ms Cassim had issues – her questions were around the financial construction which I sent to – and the coal pricing which I then sent to Mr Koko and Mr Singh for reply.     They did reply, and I sent the replies that I received to Ms Cassim on the morning of the 9 t h of December.     Yes, that’s correct.     I think the covering note just said, this is for the pre-purchase of coal – pre-payment of coal in cash for the amount of R1.68billion from Optimum to Optimum Coal Mine and the supporting documents would have been the submission and the letters between Mr Koko and Dr Ramontja.     It’s in this submission and …[intervenes].     No, I think it was the pre-payment to Optimum Coal Mine that I said not Tegeta.     Yes.     Well, it says Optimum Coal Mine.     Yes.     Yes.     No, not at all…[intervenes].     Yes, that is correct.     This is the submission for decision, it concerns the pre-purchase of coal from Optimum Coal Mine.     That is correct, Mr Chair.     It was in the documents that I sent out.     No.     I think, Mr Chairman, at the time, given the time of year, it was practicality you know ostensibly but there was a rush to get a decision, so the instruction was, send out the documents.     There was a request from the office of Mr Singh, the Chief Financial Officer, to send it out by Round Robin and, you know, that’s also when I also prepared the documents on that basis, I also sent it out.     There actually was no explanation for the urgency other than, there’s a threat to security of supply.     No, not at this submission.     Yes, that is correct.     No, it does not and more particularly if you bear in mind that there had been a commitment at the meeting of the 24 t h of November that the supply would continue.     Yes, that appeared from the documents, I did not have direct knowledge of that at the time.     No but it does – that was the contractual arrangement if you look at the documentation.     That is correct, I mean, it had a contract.     That is correct, Mr Chairman.     Yes, Mr Chairman, during the consultation with the Commission’s investigation team, I was presented with emails between Mr Eric Wood and The Businessman email and I think it was Mr Koko and Mr Singh.  My version, two of the documentations actually went outside of Eskom, it came back signed -well when I received it, it was signed.  If you look at the discussion that happened between the parties it was changed from a submission to the Investment and Finance Committee, there was information added, the financial constructions were added and it then came back to me signed, both by Mr Koko and Mr Singh.     Yes, I am there.     Yes, this is the first draft on the 7 t h of December.     Yes, that is correct.     Mr Chairman, when I received the instruction it was my view, at the time, that this was – the Investment and Finance Committee is the Committee of the Board which deals with financial matters and it needed – and a decision of this nature, I thought it go to the Investment and Finance Committee before it goes to the Board and that is why I started out preparing the document to the Investment and Finance Committee.     Yes, at that time.     Yes.     No, not at that stage, I was just given the content.  You know when – in Eskom, the terms Board was used very loosely you know, so we’re going to do a submission to Board, and they wouldn’t specify in detail.  So, my assumption, in the first instance was that this would go through the Investment and Finance Committee.     I said it – you know, in Eskom it was quite a loose term when we had discussions, like you’d hear, it was decided by the Board when it was actually a sub-committee of the Board.  So, when I started out with the draft, I started out on the assumption that it would first go to the Investment and Finance Committee.     When it came back in version – I think it was version three, it was already, the signed, the final version it came back and to the Board.     That’s correct.     Yes, that is correct.    Yes.      Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct, this is still addressed to the Investment and Finance Committee.     Yes, that is correct.     There’s an email from Businessman to Eric     What he…[intervenes].     It appears that version 2 was attached to that email, Mr Chairman, if you look at what it says in the attachments.     Yes, I confirm.     Well, I can only confirm from what he writes.     Based on what he said, he must have seen what I had written.     Well, that – I wouldn’t say those are suggestions I think those are more like instructions.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     I only know that from the emails that I’ve been shown.     From the emails that I’ve been shown from the investigating team.     Okay, it was either forwarded from Mr Koko or Mr Singh.     Oh.     Oh okay, no I don’t know then how it got to them but that’s my assumption.     Yes.     Yes.     No, I did not.     No, I was not aware of the emails at the time.     I’m talking about the email exchange, Mr Chairman.     Yes.     Of the Commission and in 2018 as well, Amu Bongani sent me some questions, I think that was the first time I became aware.     2018.     No, it hasn’t.     No, I did not.     The final draft came back signed from – first from Mr Koko and then from Mr Singh.     Yes.     Yes, I’m there.     It’s an email from Matshela Koko to me.     Yes, that is correct.     At 16h40, that’s correct     No.     Yes.     Yes, that is correct.     That is the document, yes.     To the Board of Directors, yes.     No longer to IFC, that is correct, Mr Chair.     Has now been removed.     Yes.     Yes.     The next copy is the one that I used because it contained Mr Singh’s signature.  If you look at page 492, Mr Chairman.     And then you’ll see that…[intervenes].     Yes, that’s the document, I then, used.    The CFO was the Executive Director on the Board, the Chief Officer – Group Executive Generation was a member Exec – of the Executive Committee.    Executive Committee.    As well but in terms of – when you think rank the CFO would rank.    Okay.    Yes.  I think just to put it in context Mr Chairman at this point in time Mr Singh was acting Chief Executive Officer.    Mr Singh because Matshela Koko is writing to Anoj Singh and calling him Boss.    Ja Mr Molefe was off sick at that time.    No, no he signed as Chief Financial Officer.    Yes.    Yes.    There would have been a hierarchy.  The Chief Financial Officer is actually a bit higher than the Group Executive Generation.    Yes.    Well you know at this stage I think if you just look at the emails Mr Koko signed first.    If you look at the emails in terms of the time Mr Koko signed the document first.    It is difficult.    It is ..    In terms of the – in terms of the company hierarchy the Chief Financial Officer would be higher.    Slightly higher.    Than the Group Executive Generation.    Yes that is what I am saying the Chief Financial Officer is more senior but I – I did not actually – if I look at this now Chairman I did not really take notice of the manner in which the document – the signatories were.    Please say the page again for me?    Yes I do.    Yes.    No not that I can see.    No.    Yes I see that.    Yes.    No really the Mr.    Yes.    This is going from the office Polly is the Executive or was the Executive assistant to Mr Singh and this looks like it is going from Polly to someone at Regiments.    Yes.    Yes she was as you can see it says here Executive Assistant.    Office of the Chief Financial Officer Mr Anoj Singh.    Yes.    Not at this stage but you will see later when it comes back from – when it comes back signed the – the financial verifications section Regiments is included as the party who did the financial verification.    Verification.    By – by independent parties.    You will find it on page 491.      3.7.  My apologies you will see Regiments Capital Propriety Limited added in there.    Not in this context Mr Singh because I – Mr Chairman because they did not have any input into the document to my knowledge.    Yes.    Usually if – usually if in submissions if there had been an external evaluation whether it be financial, due diligence you know where an external party say for instance a Deloittes or somebody was consulted we would then in submissions indicate who had been provided – who had done the verification. And that is why it says if applicable.    Not to my knowledge.    Yes.    Not – not really.    Ja.  Not really Mr Chairman because the basis for the – the basis for the submission was there is a supply issue and that Eskom would be the only qualified entity to say there is a supply issue.    Well given the time came near Mr Chairman there would have been not much that they could do.    Yes I see that.    No I did not.    I met Mr Eric Wood as I testified the last time Mr Chairman at Mr Essa’s offices where he introduced himself.  Mohammed Bobat I think I met at one of the COCTA Round Tables that we had with them.    Yes I see that.    No I did not.    No I did not meet her.    No.    No I do not, not from here.    Yes I can see that.    Yes that is what it looks like.    It is an email from Fahima Badat to Anoj Singh and copying Eric Wood and Mohammed Bobat and    Yes he does.    Yes.    The next day.    It comes to me at     16   And then 16   492 is the signed document by Mr Singh with    Yes that is correct. For the board not the ..    Yes.    Oh I see the difference.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Maya Barnard was the General Manager in the office of the Chief Financial Officer.    Of Mr Anoj Singh yes.    Yes.    To the board that is correct.    Yes I replied to all and asked if the Chairman has been notified or do I have to request him to allow.    But – yes he did ask for a meeting.  This is different because it is Round Robin so I just wanted to make it sure and all along we had been doing a Round Robin to the IFC now we doing a board submission.  A full board submission rather than a board sub-committee submission.    I think...    I think Ms Barnard and I spoke Mr Chairman rather than emailed given the time of the day and then I see    No, no that is why I am saying I think that Ms Barnard and I spoke.    Yes.    Yes I did.  I am just not sure of the time.  But if you – ah here it is.  If you go to page 524 Mr Chairman.      I sent it out at – on Tuesday evening at    Yes I did Mr Chairman.      Yes she did.    Yes I did so.  I then convened a meeting for    Yes.    I called them immediately after Ms Verushni Naidoo’s email because I think it was on the same – it was in the same time period.  Later in the evening.    On the 8t h.    Yes Mr Chairman if you look at 5 – actually    Yes okay.  Mr Seleka is referring me to 537 which is much easier.    Yes.  I think it is a duplication of the documentation later on.    No your question was about Mr Verushni Naidoo.    Questioning so she sent an email that evening.    Oh was I correct?    My apologies – my apologies Mr Chair it is just a lot of documents.    Yes.    That is the email I referred to Mr Chairman and this is what I then used to convene the meeting the next    Yes I would have phoned him in between.    Yes.    No I would not have convened the meeting out of my own volition.  But because it was a Round Robin Mr Chair I would have phoned him and said this is now a Round Robin you had asked for the meeting may I go ahead?     Yes, I did.   ADV SELEKA     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, they were answered.  I see we do have the emails with the ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      Yes, that is where I am.  They came the next morning and I then forwarded this to Ms Kasim.       Yes, this is the answer.  On 552, this would be the answer to Ms Kasim’s questions.     Yes.     At 08    I think that meeting was about half an hour.     It was a telephonic meeting.     No, it was not in person.  It was a telephone conference.     No, there were no complaints.     The members were Mark Pamensky who recused himself because he was the Director of Oakbay.  Mr Pat Naidoo, Ms Venete Klein and I think Mr Khosa.  Mr Zethemba Khosa.     Yes, I did arrange the telephone conference.     I think it was at 08    Yes, that is correct.     The outcome of the IFC meeting was recommend approval to the board, to approve the pre-purchase of Optimum Coal.  I mean, the pre-purchase payment to Optimum Coal Mine.  My apologies for...     Yes, I did.       [No audible reply]      Yes.     Yes, the one is the draft minute that I sent out and then the...  My apologies.  Page 582 is the draft that I sent out and 584 would be the minutes approved as signed off by the chairperson of that meeting.     Yes, that is correct.     There was only that motivation that I include in my – the salient points in my affidavit about Mr Naidoo who is the chairman of the meeting, setting out the reasons for the motivation for approving the recommendation to the board.     Yes, it is.     Yes, I did.     Yes.     Yes.     Mr Chairman, I think the most salient point for me the business case for pre-purchase of coal which is     I was reading from paragraph number three.     Yes, that is correct.     That is correct.     [No audible reply]      Yes, that is correct.     No.     Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct Mr Chair.     Yes, I did.     Yes.     Yes.     To Optimum Coal Mines, yes.     Not Tegeta.     Yes, I did send it to the board subsequently.     No, I would have sent it out because she specifically asked for it.     I mean, she specifically asked for the meeting.  So I would have sent the minutes of the meeting.     Nine o’clock.     On the 8 t h in the...  On the 8t h in the evening Mr Chairman.     Let IFC look at this.  I convened that meeting.  The documents had already gone out.     So ...[intervenes]      So I sent out the draft minutes immediately because I was typing as we were talking and I sent – it would have probably would have been within the hour of the 9t h.     Well, effectively, Mr Chairman, the approval started arriving on the evening of the 8 t h.     I said, effectively, the approval started arriving on the evening of the 8t h because the first approval was actually from Ms Naidoo.     Yes.     On the 8t h, in the evening.  And then, I think, Dr Ngubane on the morning ...[intervenes]      [No audible reply]      Yes, but ...[intervenes]      She has already registered the approval.  I     On the 9t h, yes.     And actually, Dr Naidoo also approved the     Yes.     [No audible reply]      That ...[intervenes]      That is at 572 Mr Chairman and that is     Yes, that is what I said to you, Dr Naidoo...[intervenes]      No, Mr Mark Pamensky recused himself because he was a director of Oakbay at the time.     No, he did not take part in the voting.     [No audible reply]      Yes, that is correct.     It then becomes...  It was approved in the first... It first was approved by all the members and it then...  I am not sure how it happened Mr Chairman but it then became a guarantee discussion.  The approval was for prepayment of cash payment to OCM.  And then the discussions on the 10t h, started around converting this into a guarantee.       No, the joint statement was not executed Mr Chairman.     The prepayment was approved.     Approved.       Well, that was left up to the Chief Financial Officer, the delegation.       It was approval of...  I just need to get it.  So it was...   “The Group Chief Executive together with the Group Executive for Generation and Chief Financial Officer are hereby authorised to negotiate and conclude the pre-purchase of coal agreement with the proposed owners of Optimum Coal, OCM.”     This is...  I am reading from page 577.     Yes. “The agreement shall be subject to the necessary regulatory approval having been obtained by Eskom and the supplier, respectively, as and when necessary. The Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorised to take all the necessary steps to give effect to the above including the signing of any consents or any other documentation necessary or related thereto.”     Yes, that was done.     [No audible reply]      Yes.     No, the prepayment in cash was not made.     Then the cash payment was converted to the issuing of a guarantee, the performance guarantee in favour of Tegeta.     That was at the instruction of Mr Singh.     Mr Singh.  Anoj Singh.     No, this was via the Group Treasury Department in Eskom.  There was a memorandum prepared.  I am not sure how the conversation went Mr Chair.   But there was – I was copied in on subsequent emails and you now started having to monitor what was happening.   There was a memo in which Ms Henry motivated, that it was safer to do a guarantee than a cash payment.  And this was approved by Mr Singh on the 10t h of December.     The very next day.     It all went back to the board in ...[intervenes]      No, it did not.     In 2016.     In my understanding, it was better risk management for Eskom to – effectively, it would have been giving cash to a supplier.  So from a risk management perspective and from a cost perspective, this was a better option.     Yes, there was very little question at board level Mr Chairman.  I mean, other than the two ladies who asked questions about, you know, the coal pricing and the financial constructions, there was really no discussion.     This is the ...[intervenes]      That is correct.     [Indistinct]  [Parties intervening each other – unclear.]     27...     I refer to this, the Ngubane Board in my...     I referred to it as the Ngubane Board in my affidavit.     As I said, the guarantee was issued in favour of Tegeta Exploration in 2015 and not Optimum Coal Mines.     Mr Chairman, there was an underlying clause by agreement that was put in place, that had to be – there were suspensive conditions in that agreement.  But from the guarantee perspective.   So those – there were performance – the guarantee is in the bundle of documents – but there were certain performance related, terms and conditions in that guarantee.   You will hear that it was, you know, that it expired on the 31s t of March.  So there was a measure of...[intervenes]      Yes.     Conditions were met.  But those conditions were not met.     That is Tegeta and Eskom.     [No audible reply]      Ja.     H’m.     No, not for the purposes of the decision.     I just want to say, not for the purpose of the decision.  You know, it was really ...[intervenes]      It did not matter.     Yes, that is correct Mr Chairman.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, it was Mr Chairman because the guarantee is in favour of Tegeta.     And the prepayment of cash was to Optimum Coal Mines.     Completely different.     No.       That is the only conclusion that one can draw, yes.       Yes, that is correct.     Yes, that is correct Mr Chairman.       The...[intervenes]      I just remember …[intervenes]     Yes.     Yes.     Yes, I just remember …[intervenes]     Yes, I am just not sure if she resigned at some point, but…     I cannot recall exactly when she resigned, Mr Chairman.     But she resigned in that year.     But I remember that I completed the appointment of directorship forms and things like that in October of 2015.     Yes, that is correct, Mr Chair.     Yes.  And he says    659 million.     Yes, Mr Chairman, I was approached by Ms Nteta who was the Acting General Manager Field Sourcing and she asked for assistance – she needed to get a submission to the board tender committee.  So this was around about the 8 April, it was the – I think it was a Friday and I said to her, the board tender committee is sitting on the 13 April and if you needed to get a submission in, you know, you need to get it very quickly.  I had just done a pack of late submissions so I was saying to her listen, please hurry up if you want to get to that meeting.   We – she asked for my assistance and we worked together.  By the Monday she had - you know, we had this skeleton of a submission.  Mr Mabelane then also asked for assistance to get it done. The understanding at that point was that this is going to the meeting of the 13 April, which was the Wednesday and this was about – there was a coal shortage at Arnot and that they needed to – the procurement processes were not getting done in time and they needed to secure coal.  So that was the basis on which we worked. Late the Monday afternoon I had left the office and I still did not have the submission so I was a bit nervous because having such late submissions to the board tender committee I would always bear the brunt no matter if it was the executive’s fault, the company secretary also got the tongue lashing in the meeting. It was then only later that Mr Khoza, who was the board tender committee Chairperson, phoned me, that was around 7.30 in the evening and he said to me that we needed to convene a meeting that evening and I asked him what was this about because, you know, we have a meeting 48 hours, can it not wait until then?  He said it was about …[intervenes]     The 13 April.     13 t h.     One three.     On the 11 April.     And this is in the evening of the 11 t h.     Yes, that is correct, Mr Chair.  So this was not …[intervenes]     Yes.     The 11 t h and it is already 7.30 p.m. in the evening.     This was an additional meeting, a special meeting, as we called them.     And this would be to just consider one particular topic.     He said to me that there was an emergency - you know, that there was an emergency at Arnot Power Station and that this is why this meeting was now urgent.  When I said we have 48 hours to the next meeting, it can wait.     There was emergency supplies at Arnot Power Station, once again a security of supply issue.     And he said the operational people told him that it was urgent.  At the time I did not have any document yet and I then called Mr Mabelane, who was the official responsible and I received a submission and it was closer to 8 p.m. in the evening when I got that and with the request because I asked him to give me a reason to convene a meeting.  So it was to discuss the emergency supply at Arnot Power Station. So when I called all the board members – the BTC members.  These were Mr Khoza, Ms Naidoo, Ms Carrim and Ms Mabude and they all indicated that they were available, full meeting.  I sent out the documentation and I convened the meeting – I think it was nine o’clock that evening.  Ms Mabude was the only one who indicated that she will be a bit late for the meeting but she attended.  I sent. I sent out the submission documents once received from Mr Mabelane.  There were once again questions from Ms Naidoo, Viroshnee Naidoo, which I sent to the executives and said look, these are the questions that you are going to need to answer.  The meeting went ahead at nine o’clock …[intervenes]    Positively Mr Chair I do remember, I nodded my head, my apologies.     As I said Mr Chairperson the underlying agreement that we were working on was a co-supply agreement, which was supposed to be between the three batches of coal from Optimum Coal, so that was the agreement that we were attempting to put in place at the time.     I think on the strength of that agreement is a better way to put it.     We – yes I did, I engaged the services of Cliff Dekker Hofmeyr to assist, I think we received a suggested two-pagers from the Primary Energy Department, I am not quite sure how it happened, but there was a two pager agreement in place that we went through.     As I said Mr Chairman I can’t remember how exactly that came about.      Yes I am there.     There is an email Mr Chairman from myself to Mr Anoj Singh and it says letter agreement to get an     Yes, this is the agreement on 774.     It is a draft yes.     The email above mine is from Mr Anoj Singh to Mr Eric Wood, and he forwards the agreement as is to Mr Wood.     That is correct.     There is an email there in reply from Mr     Yes that is correct.      Can I have it again Mr Seleka please, I didn’t hear it.       Yes I am there.     It is an email from Businessman to Matshela2010 and there’s a two pager between, the subject     That’s what it looks like and then it is sent to me at 7.31.      But I think this is – if you look at the time it is GMT+2, so it might be different time zones, that could be the explanation I think.      No that is not his Eskom email address Mr Chairman but that is his personal yahoo address.     Yes.     I don’t recall the email specifically Mr Chairman but yes it has my name on it so I accept that it was sent to me.     I am not sure about the timing, this seems to be at 7.31 in the morning, I do recall that I had instructed Mr – Cliff Dekker Hofmeyr on that day.     Yes it does because it is the 10 t h December 8.42, I speak to Rochelle Moodley about the Optimum Eskom fee purchase.     Here I ask please call me, I need your assistance in drafting this agreement, urgent time pressure, I need the draft by twelve o’clock.     Yes.      I think that is what it would mean Mr Chairman, I can’t remember precisely, it is five years ago, but I did send if these attachments were there then I did send them.      Condition Precedent.     That could be Mr Chairman.     Yes.     Yes I see that.    It seems to be the same.     Yes he was.      Yes it has been forwarded to me.     Not at the time Mr Chairman.       I really just took it and looked at the top and went and did the agreement.     He probably would have called me.     And discussed with me.     I really don’t remember, you know just given the way that it happened there he may have but I can’t [audio cuts out]      I really can’t remember the specific phone call of that day.     [laughing] that is correct Mr Chair.    We were close at that time.     I would have probably found it you know.     H’m that’s correct Mr Chair but as I sit here today I cannot remember that, you know those particular phone calls, there were lots of phone calls between us.      The fact that I acted on the email I can say there must have been a conversation, but because I don’t have an independent recollection as I sit here today, but judged on what I did there must have been a conversation.     I am just trying to place, Mr Chairman I think I had my suspicion.     Yes.     That given you know the nature of what was being discussed that this could be Mr Essa.    Mr Chair I think if I look at the – what I witnessed in that year ...[intervenes]      What I had witnessed in that year, 2015 and knowing what Mr Essa was capable of I would have, you know I was quite careful.    No, I had the knowledge.     Yes.     Yes.     No.     Yes.     Yes it did.     That is correct Mr Chairman but at that ...[intervenes]      I should have Mr Chairman but at that stage I did not.  I really did not.     Yes, that I accept you know, it is just that I want you to take into consideration the mood at the time, you know.  Yes it may be so that Mr Koko and I were close, but the fact that we had experienced what we did, that closeness was already waning, it wasn’t at that point, remember this is now December 2015, it is not at this stage where I can say hey what is going on here.     No that is why I am saying that is incorrect you know because you will remember last time I said to you that’s incorrect, he is conflating the dates.     It started late 2016.  I had already you know started trying to be mindful of what I witnessed and mindful of you now the rush – witnessing what the Board had done, that there definitely was outside influence.   You know I cannot sit here and tell you there wasn’t.   You know that would be just nonsense.   Mindful of that I started putting the distance and I think it was late 2016 when we started having, we started getting all these questions from about the first quarter of March, I mean the first quarter of 2016, about you know the Gupta affiliations, the connections and all of those things, and in that process the distance, I tried to keep the distance but it also maintained the professional relationship, so I think when Mr Koko uses a particular incident which is really, it started way before then.    It is the same.    Mr Chairman I suspected at the time – I did not have concrete evidence and that ...    Yes I – I.    You know asking the…    Well I think I – I really did not want to – to cause any trouble for myself.    No, no.    Just remember I mean.    I want to just – I want to dispel that.    Because – I want to dispel that …    Yes.    We were but not that close but I would now be able to be in a position to say to him – hey?    Yoh Mr Chairman I mean – I think you would have to – you would have to understand the mood of Eskom at that time.    Ja look at the time I just did not want to upset the applecart and you know what now when you look back at it I should have done so.    No I accept that proposition.    Yes I am not going – I am not going to argue with you.    You know but I just wanted to please understand that the mood was very, very different to the ordinary corporate environment.    And especially if you know you want to give the appearance of being friendly.  Because I had witnessed – remember I had now sat in on a number of sort of purportedly closed meetings and I had seen how these people operate.  And it was not – I mean Mr Koko was the only one who came back.  And here we have Mr Singh, we have Mr Molefe, we have Mr – Dr Ngubane and they all seem to be in the same circle you know.  And the limited – at that stage the limited exposure that I had had to the board members you know they had acted quite ruthlessly when someone questioned things.  You know.  So for me it was just – I would ask you – yes I accept I should have done more.  There is no way I can say to you you know I should not.  With the benefit of hindsight if I were a co-sec today I would certainly do things differently.    Yes I think that – I think you would find that even in his – I am not sure which version of his     Affidavit or you know – he says that I told him that is that is the chairman’s address.  I mean the records clearly show it came from him you know.  So I would really dispute that.  I did not at any time say to him that this was the Chairman’s address.    Yes Mr Chair.    That is a fair assessment I mean we cannot argue with this Mr Chairman.    Mr Chairman I did get a bit bolder as time went on.  So when – when I was asked to advise I did so.      When I saw the need and both Mr Chair when I was asked to advise we put in place a program of director training etcetera you know so I continued to do the – the duties that I was engaged for.  So it was a combination.    I think it was…    I think I got those – I think I got those dates from him Mr Chairperson because the – we did not have them in the – in the agreements we drafted.    I was not aware of that at the time Mr Chairman.  I later became aware when that came out in the media.    I think it was…    I think it was March – it was the end of March.    Yes.    It did – yes it did.    Okay.    Thank you.    Thank you. 
DANIELS: Under normal circumstances, yes Mr Chairman, I may have been able to do that but at this stage, I did not have enough information.  You know, when he called me, all that he said is that, I would need to convene a board meeting and that I would get the information from the executives.   His appointment, his permanent appointment was only confirmed in October 2015.   I think Mr Chairman I sort of compartmentalised it in terms of this is coming from Matshela Koko. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Good afternoon Chair.     We are Chair.  It is Mr Holden.     Thank you Chair.  Mr Holden, today we are going to be talking about the kickback payments made in respect of the locomotive contracts from Transnet and we are going to be talking about payments to Tequesta and Regiments, Asia.   Before we get there, I wonder if we could just go through the cast of characters so the Chair has a sense of who we will be referring to in due course?     We are using FOS-6 Chair.     That is correct Chair.     And Chair, to give you a sense of where we are to be going.  The locomotive’s contract were paid in two different stages.  They started out being paid through entities called JJ Trading and Century General Trading which were part of the World Windows Group and those payments were made generally in the UAE.   And then at a certain point, they shifted to Tequesta and Regiments, Asia which were more directly integrated into the Gupta enterprise as opposed to the World Windows Group that was just laundering for them.   And Tequesta and Regiments, Asia payments were made initially in Hong Kong and then we can see that they moved back into the UAE at a later stage.   Although sequentially, the JJT and CGT payment started first, we are going to just do it in reverse order.  So we will talk today about the Hong Kong payments to Tequesta and Regiments, Asia and then tomorrow we will go back to the World Windows Group and JJT and CGT.     Just to introduce some of the characters and companies we will be referring to today.  Mr Holden, can I ask you to go to your report at page 175 of the bundle?     Yes.       175.       And there you list the people to whom you are referring in your report.  Under A, Individuals Gupta Family, most of the names are familiar but can you tell the Chair who you have under Paragraph V, Kamal Singhala?     Sure.       [No audible reply]      And have you seen reports of his wedding?     Can you tell the Chair what you read in the reports of that wedding?     And can you date that wedding and place it or...?     That is correct.  Then the next person I would ask you to explain to the Chair is Aashika Singh.     And you just mentioned Tequesta and Regiments, Asia, I think, talking about them a lot.  Can you briefly tell the Chair who they were?     And we have come backwards and forwards to the World Windows Group.  Can you just again tell the Chair briefly what the World Windows Group was and what its relationship to the Gupta enterprise was?     And you mentioned Piyoosh Goyal.  Chair, you might remember, he was the man whose name was on the email with – to which the Transnet Cranes Tender Report was forwarded.  We discussed that last week. The other World Windows Group individual we will come across today is Rupesh Bansal.  Can you tell the Chair who he is or what we know about him?     Can I just stop you at that point?  Can you go to page 869.63?     Chair, do you have an 869.63?     Chair, this is a...  Let’s make into a...  I think the documents are ...[intervenes]      Coming down in a second.     Chair, I must apologise.  Could we ask for a five minute adjournment, just that we can sort out your files and the witness’s files?     Thank you Chair.     Sorry about that Chair.     We were talking about Rupesh Bansal and you had mentioned a company called WW Ventures Limited and I had asked you to go to Annexure DD which is at page 869.63.  And sorry Chair...[intervenes]      Your bundle has now been split between two files.     So it would be bundle FOS-6A and FOS-6B.  This is at the start of FOS-6B.     I will have to refer to A and B each time I mention a document.     But for record purposes Chair.     Any number in FOS-6 that is above 869 ...[intervenes]      ...will be in Bundle B.     869 and below is Bundle A.     That is correct Chair.     That is correct Chair.     Chair, so this is now Bundle 6B, 869.33.  It is point 63.  Can you identify that document to the Chair?     And can you direct the Chair to Mr Bansal’s role in that company?     And then if you go over the page, can you tell the Chair who the second director is?     We do not need his details.  Just his name.       And Chair, that will be at page 869.65 of Bundle 6B.     Now, Mr Bansal is going to appear in connection with a very important email.  Can I ask you to go to page 419 of Bundle 6A and explain to the Chair what that email is?     419, Bundle A Chair.     6A.     That is correct Chair.     Thank you Chair.  Mr Holden, can you start at the bottom of the page which is where the stream starts and explain what this email is?     Sorry, before you go further Mr Holden.  Chair, can I just ask you to make a note of that email address of Mr Yang Minu because we will find it again.     Indeed.     Indeed.     And going up the stream, what happens to that email?     And are you able to identify who Businessman is? MR     And to whom – and going up to the top of the trial.     Can I then ask you to turn to the following page, which is Bundle 6A, page 420?  And is that the attachment...  Oh, sorry.  Where did you find that email?     And the document that we see on page 420 of Bundle 6A, what is that?     We were going to go through it in some detail but while we are here, why do we not just go through it now?  If you can explain to the Chair how that spreadsheet works?     That is per locomotive Chair.     That is correct.     Can you just explain to the Chair how each one of these projects seemed to, what we have been calling the 1064 Purchase?     Yes.  We talked a lot about the 64 Project but these are component parts of that project.  Can you explain to the Chair what...  Well, they are not all component parts in that project.  Can you explain to the Chair how these fit in with the 1064 Project and what kind of locomotives there are and who the purchaser is?     And I think you referred to the 54 Project.  I presume you meant to say the 1064 Project.     The 100 Project?     Sorry, let us come back to that because there will be... I think the Chair may have heard evidence about the decision by Transnet to fast track a pre-purchase of a hundred electrical locomotives.     Because – extensively because the 1064 procure was being ...[intervenes]      But anyway.  Let us go further down the table so that we understand the numbers in it.       Sorry, I think you are confusing millions and billions.     So if you can start again.     Can you just read that note in red that explains how one reaches that figure – how that figure of 123.903 million Dollars was reached?     Then in the next row, receivables from CSR.     And the total amount that it would pay?     Then the next line, what does that refer to?     Next line.     The next line on expenditures?     I think that is 55 million.     And then the next line, which I imagine gives the JJT/CJT total payment...  Well, payment breakdown.  Maybe if you can just tell us what that total figure to go to JJT and CJT would be?     And then the bottom line which is crucial for letting us know what had actually been paid at that stage and what was still to be paid.     Underneath.  Just keep reading through that – until the bottom of the table.     So whatever remained after the deduction of the Rand equivalent of 123.9 million Dollars from the total of R 5.267 billion would still be payable to JJT/CJT but 85% of that, they would have to account to the Guptas for.     So let us now turn to the agreements in terms of which all of these payments were made.  And while we are it, we may identify one or two – or actually one additional agreement that we will discuss tomorrow.  Can I ask you now to turn to Annexure A on FOS, Bundle 6A, page 298?     It is Bundle 6 A, page 298.  Chair, 298.     No, 298 Chair.     Bundle 6, page 298.     And this is a contract that we will get to tomorrow but very briefly because we are going through the whole batch of contracts, can you tell the Chair what this contract relates to?     So – I mean, we will get to in detail tomorrow but this, to anticipate tomorrow, is kickback contract in relation to the Transnet procurement of cranes from ZPMC.     Then the next agreement which is the first agreement that we have dealing with the locomotives contract, that is on page 304 of bundle 6A and it is annexure B.  And on page 304 can you briefly describe how the cover page describes this agreement?     And then if you go over the page to page 305 can you further share the date of the agreement?     And the first party named on the agreement?     Then if you can go down to following page 306 under the definitions.  There is a definition of project and product, can you redact those definitions out for the Chair?     Then there is – well, if you go to page 309 the terms of payment are described under clause 7.  Can you take the Chair to those?     Sorry, can you just pause there, that would be the 232 locomotives, diesel locomotives project according to the definitions.     And then 7.5?     And then if you go down to page 313 can you just identify who the individual is who must receive notices on behalf of Tequesta Group Limited?     Clause 12.1.3.     And then to the signature page on 315 and if you can just identify the signatories to the Chair?     And then if we can go to the next contract, that is on page 316, it is annexure C and again on the title page, the parties?     And over the page on 317, the date and individual representing Regiments Asia?     If you can then go down to page 320 and identify the project?     And at 324, the payment terms in clause 7?     Then down to page 329 to see who gets notices for Regiments Asia.      And at 332, the signatures?     The next contract is a draft contract, it is annexure D at page 334.  It was superseded by annexure at page 346, so because we are going to deal with neither of them today maybe you can skip annexure D and go straight to annexure E and briefly describe to the Chair what annexure E, page 346.     346, Chair.     Now we are not going to discuss this very briefly just to tell the Chair what it governed.     Can you just repeat those two figures?  What was the original anticipated cost?  What was the benchmark cost in the contract above which BEX would get their commission?     And that benchmark price is at page 357, annexure A.     Then we come to the contract which is the most famous of all of these contracts, it is annexure F at page 358.  Can you take the Chair to that contract and the parties on the cover page?     At page 362 we see the project to which this refers.     And then if you can go to page 365, paragraph 3.3 and explain to the Chair what that clause deals with?     I think do, yes.     Then if you can go to page 367 clause 6.1.1.       So can you explain broadly what that is describing?     Then the notices at the foot of page 370.     The signature page, 375?     Then annexure A, the services that Tequesta and Mr Salim Essa had to provide CSR for in return for these billions of rands are listed.  Can you take the Chair through those services and then we will pause and reach the final clause.     376, Chair.     Can you read the clause after all of this?     Yes.  Now, can you – so this is for the 359 electric locomotive project.  Do you remember when that tender was awarded?     Yes.  Well, it was part 1064 locomotives so the BADC decision was in March 2014.  What is the date of this contract?     So we …[intervenes]     They were indeed, Chair.  As was Mr Essa.  Then you have sourced from Hong Kong, from Hong Kong Companies office, details of the Tequesta Group Limited.  Can I take you to annexure G on page 377 and can you tell the Chair what that document is?     And what did it tell you of interest?     And then …[intervenes]     Then can I take you to another document that you sourced in relation to Tequesta from the Hong Kong Companies office, it is page 385 and can you tell the Chair what that document is?     So would I be correct in assuming that on the 17 November 2016 Aashika Singh replaced Salim Essa as the sole director of Tequesta?     Can we then go to our next contract which is annexure H on page 388 and can you tell the Chair what – who the parties to that contract are?     If you go down to page 392 you see project, can you tell the Chair which project this agreement relates to.     And then at page 398, the payment terms?     Please do, yes.    And this contract has for the first time has some banking details attached to it for the Regiments or to quest the party, they are at page 405.  Can  you take the Chair to that?      And then can you take the Chair to the signatories to that contract at page 406?    And then briefly to 407 where we see the same addendum that we saw to the previous agreement talking about services.  Can I at this time ask you to just read out the last clause of the addendum?    And then you had made some inquiries at the Hong Kong company’s office in relation to Regiments?  Regiments Asia.  Can I ask you to go to page 408?      Can  you tell the Chair what that document at 408 is?    At the top of page 409, the email address of Regiments Asia?    Page 411, where it identifies the Director.    Then on page 416, there’s a second document.  I understand you sourced that too from the Hong Kong Company’s office.  Can you tell the Chair what this is?    And if I remember correctly, it is the same date, 17 November 2016 as was the case in relation to Tequesta.    Can we then go to the next contract which is Annexure K, page 421?  And can you describe to the Chair what this contract or who the parties to this contract are and what it does?    And the essence or the purpose of the contract is, is essentially set out in clause 2.1.  Can you read that clause to the chair and explain its significance?    That page 422, sorry Chair.  422.    Oh Chair, I must apologise.  I think that the replacement pages for this, for this agreement it should have been – no, this agreement has always been in the file.  Does you 422 page start with …    Yes.    Yes.  Yes.  Chair, Chair no we are on the right page.  So it’s 2.1.  Well the whole of 2, essentially deals with the restructuring of the payment and 2.1 is the, is the critical provision.      Mr Holden?      And then clause 2.2.    And, and then what is detailed below?  What is that table refer to?    I think you need to go down a page or two, because the table continues much longer.      Sorry, I apologise.  You are absolutely right.      And then the next table?    And can you go to page 425 and 425.1 to identify the signatories?      I may, I may have made an error there.  Let’s look at 425.  I will check my source document to see if there is a 425, if there should be a 425.1.     Chair, I don’t want us to delay now.  But we will search for the signatories.    The signatory page.      Chair, can I ask if your 426 …    The 426 is a document that ought to have a replacement agreement in it.  Can I ask what your 426 cover page says?    That’s the correct ja.    Can I just check with Mr Holden if he has the correct document in front or he has a duplicate of the previous document?    Can I offer you this replacement?  And this is our last agreement.  Can you tell the Chair Mr Holden what this agreement is on page 426?    And can I ask you to go to 2.2 on page 429?  And tell the Chair what, what that deals with?    And then the table?    I’m afraid they are Chair.  This is a – whoever leaked these documents didn’t, didn’t use a photocopier or …    If they did …    I think the most important figure is the total.      And then if we go to the signatory page on 430.1?      So we have seen a series of contracts and the ones that we focused on are the ones between the Chinese Rail Companies and Tequesta and Regiments Asia.  I want us now to go back and we’ve, we’ve touched on some earlier contracts with the Chinese Rail Companies and JJT and CGT.   I want us now to go back to that document with the workings email which indicated how much had been paid to JJT and CGT and how much was still due to be paid.  That’s on page 419 of bundle 6A.  Can I ask you to go to 419?  And I want us to focus on the dates here.   And you’ve taken the Chair through these dates.  The original email is 6 January 2015.  It’s from Bunsal Rupesh(?) who you identified as a World Window individual.  Zhang Min Yu. Can you explain who Zhang Min Yu is?      And then Zhang Min Yu forwarded it to Businessman, who we believe to be Salim Essa on 7 January 2015.  And then there was a delay of more than two months before it got forwarded again to Asha Tjala(?) on the 22n d of March.  Want us to – can you broadly describe to the Chair what was happening in the Gupta enterprise world window relationship over that period, first quarter 2015?     And, and the first agreement that we see between the Chinese Railway Companies and Tequesta or Regiments Asia that provides for monies that were previously to go to JJT or CGT now to come to Tequesta or Regiments Asia is I’m correct the annexure F.  Page 358 which is the 15 – sorry the 18 May 2015 agreement between Tequesta and CSR, that records the 707 million that’s already been paid to JJT and has that provision that if that Tequesta must essentially make sure that that money will be deducted from what’s due to Tequesta and that Tequesta must take of JJT.      Yes, but not – that does not deal with taking over.    Well taking over rights to payment that previously had vested in JJP or CGT. MR    I want now to look a bit more closely at Mr Zhang Min Yu and what he was doing in the first quarter of 2015.  Can I ask you to go to bundle 6B annexure XX at page 1110?      That’s correct Chair.      B.  Bundle B.  6B.    Yes, but it should go, it should go until – 1110 should be quite close to the end.    1110.      Can you identify that document for the Chair?  Or can you say where that document comes from?    And what is it?    Can I then ask you to turn to page 112 and to identify that document to the Chair?    Chair …    Chair.  1112.  That’s correct.    It’s a string that in fact starts on the previous, previous page.    But for now I ask Mr Holden just to identify the parties to the end of the string which is at the top of page 112.    1112, not 112.    And the date, sorry.  Ja, you have just given the date to which it relates.  Can you tell the Chair what the string is dealing with?      And if you go to the foot of page 1113 we see the passengers who are going to be flying on this chartered plane in another email for Asha Chawla to Sunial Gow, at sunialaircharterservices.com.  Also on 16 March 2015.  Can you identify those passengers for the Chair?    And so we know about the first three.  Do you know who Mr Digaan Yuan is?      And Mr Wang Jincheng?      And do you know who Mr Mokesh may be?  I think the record won’t be able to see your faces.  So I think that ...  (indistinct).    [Indistinct] you had no reason to believe that you should know.      The face looks like he does not know who this ...  (indistinct).      Our last issue in relation to – our last email in relation to Mr Zhang Min Yu is at page 1115.  Can you identify that email to the Chair?    And if you down a page to 1116, can you identify that document for the Chair?    And you’ve highlighted one entry. Can you tell the Chair what that entry is?    Thank you Mr Holden.  While we’re on this topic, can I ask you to go to page 1117 and if I recall correctly, Mr Zhang Min Yu stay at the Oberoi were 27 February to 1 March 2015.    Can you tell the Chair what you see on page 1117?    And then if you go down to page 11120.    And then down to 1122?      And the dates?  That reservation?    Can you then go down to page 113 …    I think we probably can, but we do know who the reservation was for Chair, because that’s at 1123.      [Indistinct] the paragraph above the reference to Ashika Singh identifies Mr Anash Singh.      Indeed Chair.    Now so we have Anash Singh, Ashika Singh and Tony Gupta at the Oberoi from I think the 24t h to the 26t h of February and we have Zhang Min Yu at the Oberoi from the 27t h of February to the 1s t of March.  Can I ask you to go to 1125 and this is a document sourced by the Commission Chair.      It’s Mr Anash Singh’s immigration records from the Department of Home Affairs.      And what this document reflects is that Mr Anash Singh left OR Tambo on an Emirates flight 766 on the 23rd of February 2015 and returned on Emirates flight 767 on the 1 s t of March 2015.      We have been through the registration documents of Tequesta and Regiments Asia.  I think we’ll come back to abbeylie and stevenmslie a little later.  Can I ask you now to turn to bundle 6B, page 995.1.  995.1?  And Chair, this is a document that that Commission obtained from HSBC and it attaches transactions – it’s an affidavit from an HSBC …    That’s correct Chair.    Bundle 6B.    Chair I must apologise for that. Can I offer you up a copy of 995 …    Well the whole 995.1 to point 34 bundle because …    That needs to …    It comes in between 995 and 996.    We’ll have to clean up your, your file.    Later Chair.    So Chair at 995.1 you will see an affidavit furnished by Thomas Fletcher Shenfield(?) who is the Country Head of Financial Threat Litigation for HSBC Bank BLC Johannesburg branch, which is HSBC South Africa.  And he has furnished this affidavit to provide transaction records for four entities that the Commission has been looking at.   Freedom Trading Limited, Morning Star International Trade Limited, Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group.  And the, these are transaction records that went through the South African office of HSBC when they conducted their own investigation.  It confirms their authenticity as HSBC records of the transaction.  And the transactions for Regiments Asia are annexure 3 to that affidavit, which is at – sorry.  Which start at page 995.11.      And those for Tequesta are annexure 4 to the affidavit that start at 995.16.      Now Mr Holden we have made these records available to you.  And you, you’ve analysed them and, and drawn some conclusions from them. Can you, can I ask you to go to page 263 of bundle 6A which is back in your report?      At 263 Chair.    Can we, sorry Chair.  HS – included in those HSBC records are also records for JJ Trading that HSBC has.  And for Century General Trading that HSBC has.  I must emphasise then in relation to JJ Trading and Century General Trading, what HSBC has is a small window, small section of the total banking records, because they ran several accounts at banks, other than HSBC.    Yes.    I wonder do  you have the original spread sheets or the spread sheets that were made available. That might …    If we can first go to your, your sort of overall big picture findings at, at paragraph 264.      I think we must just come back to that total figure, because I’m not sure it’s accurate.  But we will come back to it.  265 Is, is the – when you break it down.    Sorry NN is your extract from the HSBC documents, not the original HSBC?    And paragraph 266?   MR    And, and then your totals to Regiments Asia and to Tequesta by each of those Chinese locomotive companies.      Can I ask you to go back to paragraph 264, because I think that figure of 187 million includes also payments that the HSBC records show to JJ Trading and CG Trading.  Because it’s greater than the sum of the sum of the Regiments Asia and Tequesta payments.    Well before we get to that, those tables, can you just identify those tables to the Chair. Table 3 on page 264.      And then the aggregate amount paid to Regiments Asia and to Tequesta Group in the Hong Kong HSBC accounts you have a 145 dollar, $145 177 086,91.    At prevailing exchange rates what would, what would that be?    In fact would be quite a lot more than 1,6 billion rand at today’s.  Sorry at today’s exchange rate.    Oh, oh, sorry.  Okay.  We should probably do the same exercise that we promised the Chair in relation to rand exchange rates and rand equivalents on each of those payments, which we will do.  Then can I ask you to go to annexure II.   Which is at page bundle – sorry, just see.  Bundle 6B, page 885.1 to 885.25?  And again I think we might need you to go to the source spread sheet to magnify it on screen.  Can you identify this document at annexure II?    And can you describe to the Chair how, how this document – I mean the original document is a spread sheet, but can you describe to the Chair how each one of the page, what each one of the pages does?      So, so just to take – maybe if we could go to – because let’s illustrate one with reference to the HSBC accounts.  And maybe we can use – so if you can maybe go to 885.5 which is the tab that relates to the 232 Locos.  So if you click on your 232 Locos tab there, okay each one of these sheets relates to a different underlying contract between Transnet and the Chinese Rail Manufacturers.    So at page 885.5 we have the 232 Locos which was one, which was a diesel contract with China North Rail.  That, is that correct?    Subsequently replaced by CRRC as both China North and China South were.  And Mr Holden let’s take these columns one by one.  So the starting column is the date?    Do, do proceed.  Yes.      Can I stop you there and Chair can I ask you to go to bundle 6B at page 995.11?  995.11 Where we ...  (indistinct).    995.11.    And these are the Regiments Asia, HSBC records.  And the four amounts that Mr Holden has just cited from that spread sheet, you will find Chair on the fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth entry on that page.  So if you go across, the first column says transaction identity.  The second says source transaction type code.   Original currencies, US dollars all the way through.  The posting date and the value date.  Let’s look at the value dates, you go four down, there is 2014/12/08 and the amount is 3599998, which corresponds almost exactly to what Ama Bongani had. Then 35974998, 3716998, and 3649998. Which are those four …    Payments.     3577998.    If we go back to the Abu Bongani document, annexure II.      Sorry Mr Holden, when you say here can you identify the column?    Apologies.    And because the printed copies don’t have column headings, they have column headings but not column letters.  Can you just read the, the what looks like the heading to the column in, in that red band?    But we will get, we will get bigger and better.  Then they have to be A2.    Because there is so much detail.      But what the spread sheet does, is each one of these pages relates to a different one, contract, the 100 locomotives contract.  The 95 locomotives contract.  The 232 locomotives contract.  The maintenance contract and so on.  And it tracks what you would expect the kickback to be what you see at HSBC.      And they broadly match up in all cases.  It’s an extraordinary piece of work by the looks of it.    Absolutely.    The – let’s have a little bit of light relief.  Let’s see who before we get into the laundering of these funds, let’s see …    Chair my guess is 45 minutes to …    Thank you Chair.    Can I, can I ask you to go back to porch at page 267, Bundle 6A at page 267, and there you have identified a series ...[intervenes]      Yes.    Yes Chair I will have to speak to the Secretary to see if an original 6 still exists, because I think what they have done is the have cannibalised – but one way or another we will – either you will get an original 6 plus your current 6A and B or we will have to do that exercise.     Those individuals what were you able to find about them from public records?      Prachi Desai.     We found a sort of glossy mag, an Indian glossy mag online, Chair if you go to 6B page 94.     Yes Chair.     1094 and Mr Holden can you describe to the Chair what 1094 is?     And then if you go to the contents page on 1095 there’s an entry for what we find at page 8 of the magazine.     And if you go to page 1096 we see this article about Turkish Delight, can you read the first two paragraphs and the first line of the third.        Okay if we can stop there, can you just identify what we found in relation to Catalyst in the HSBC payments?     No Chair this will be 6A 277, but if you just keep that bundle open because we are going to go to the next page in a minute.     That’s correct Chair.     Is it page 268.     Sorry, what was that date?     And if you go back to page 1096 6B what was the date that the wedding started?     Right, let’s see what Prachi Desai did at the wedding.  Can I ask you to – I’ve lost my reference, do you have the reference to Prachi Desai?     6B Chair yes.     And can you remind the Chair what Prachi Desai was paid out of that HSBC account?       Thank you.  Now if we move away from payments to individuals to see where most of this money was distributed at page 269 of your bundle 6A in your report you produced a table of companies that received amounts in excess of a million dollars from that – from the Regiments and Tequesta HSBC accounts.  Can I ask you just to take the Chair through that table, page 269.     I think in the interests of speeding up maybe just describe to the Chair what this table is doing generally because it really speaks for itself.     Then you produced another table under 6.4.3 which you refer to at the bottom of page 270, paragraph 282.  That table – sorry that table is included on Annexure NN but it relates to an entity called Morning Star International, can you tell the Chair who Morning Start International are?     And at paragraph 284 you list a range of companies that received payments from all of Regiments, Tequesta and Morning Star International, can you identify them?      And what do you – what conclusions do you draw from the fact that there are companies receiving payments from Regiments Asia, Tequesta and Morning Star?       At 286 to get ahead of ourselves a little bit you talk about payments from the Tequesta Group Limited accounts at Habib Bank in Dubai, can you just take the Chair through that paragraph?     Can I ask you to turn to 6B, page 977, and can you identify that document for the Chair?     Then can I ask you to go back to page 272 of Bundle A.  There you talk about a Sunnyside Import and Export CC report by the Reserve Bank, first can I ask you to identify that report by going to – sorry, we are jumping between bundles, it is  now going to be Bundle B page 1051.     6B 1051.     And can you identify that document to the Chair?     And – so this dealt with Exchange Control Violations by Sunnyside and I ask you to turn to page 1060 of the same bundle and can you identify that document for the Chair?     And those are across border transactions?     Can I then ask you to turn to page 1093 and this is a document that you have generated, can you tell the Chair what it is?     And have you counted them, do you know how many there are?     And what inference do you draw from the fact that there are 23 companies who Sunnyside Import & Export did transactions, did cross-border transactions with from South Africa who also were paid money by Regiments Asia and Tequesta?     You have repeatedly referred to what is going on in those Tequesta and Regiments Asia accounts is money laundering, can I ask you to go to page 281 of Bundle 6A where you identify what you describe as obvious signs of money laundering taking place through these accounts and can you take the Chair through those signs, those indications of money laundering?    And then finally your concluding remarks at page 284 paragraph 304 in relation to the Hong Kong accounts of Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group.      Thanks Mr Holden.  I realise we haven’t taken you, some of those conclusions are based on material in your report which we haven’t actually addressed in these hearings but I think we have done quite well for tonight.   I am not going to ask you to go back. Chair that concludes Mr Holden’s evidence on the kick backs paid into Hong Kong for the Transnet Locomotives contract.  Tomorrow we will be dealing with the kickbacks paid to CDT and JJT and the World’s Window Network at an earlier stage.   I understand that the Eskom evidence tomorrow may in fact finish earlier ...[intervenes]      ...than anticipated so would you like us to be on standby from two o’clock?     He was suggesting that two o’clock would be a sensible time.     Thank you Chair. 
MR HOLDEN:   Good afternoon Chair.     Is that the bundle there?     Can I just have the page number again, please?     I am there, yes.     Certainly.  I would actually like to cross-reference it against the person, if I can?     If I can just locate that?     Chair, Kamal Singhala which I described at FOS-6 290 which the ...[indistinct] person [speaker not clear].  He was AJ Gupta’s son and he was also a director of VR Laser alongside Salim Essa.       Yes, I have.     We see that a certain amount – well, a particular individual was hired for that wedding who will be – who were identified receiving funds from Regiments, Asia at a certain point.       Yes, the wedding took place in Turkey.  I just need to double check the article again.  I think it is in 2015.       Certainly, Chair.  Aashika Singh was an Indian National.  She was an employee of Infinity Media which was a Gupta enterprise company or at least we can track one payment to her which is recorded as a salary payment.   The relevance of Ms Singh in this regard is that at a certain point at Tequesta and Regiments, Asia which acted as the primary conduit through which being paid, Salim Essa stepped down as the sole director and he was also replaced – he was then replaced by Aashika Singh.   And I am sure as we will get throughout the testimony, there is also an indication that she was present at a particularly notable gathering in Dubai.     Certainly, Chair.  Tequesta and Regiments, Asia were two companies that were formed in Hong Kong.  They were from – what we can gather from the company information records in Hong Kong, they were registered by an online company formation agent who specialises in the creation of companies in offshore tax havens.  They were initially registered with Salim Essa, the sole director, a position they held until 2016.     Certainly, Chair.  The World Windows Group is conglomerate companies, headquartered in India.  At the time of the matters under consideration here, the World Windows Group head by a man by the name of Piyoosh Goyal.   The Gupta Leaks shows that from at least early 2010 onwards until at least mid-2015, there was quite an intense and a lucrative business relationship between the World Windows Group and the Gupta enterprise and that included the World Windows Group operating two companies by name of JJ Trading and Central General Trading, both of which were acted as money laundering vehicles form which kickbacks from suppliers in relation to Transnet contracts were received and dissipated to Gupta enterprise companies.     Certainly, Chair.  He is a bit of a mystery figure.  What we do know about it – the extent what we know about it is included in a very limited amount of information appearing in companies house filings in ...[indistinct] [speaker not clear] companies of houses, the UK version of CIPC here.   There is a company by the name of WW Ventures in which Mr Bansal appears as a co-director with Mr Goyal.  That ...[intervenes]      I do not have an 869.63 in the bundle I am afraid.     Certainly, Chair.  This the Companies House filing for WW Ventures Limited which is a company with registration number 07629898 which is registered in the UK with a specific address, Settler Floor, Heathrow, Cube 9, Arkwright Road, Collin Brook, Slow, Middlesex, England, SL30HJ.     Certainly, Chair.  He appears at the following page, which is Bundle 6A, FOS-06-869.64.  It indicates the company director one is one Mr Rupesh Bansal with a service address of 29 Woodcraft Crescent, Axe Bridge, Middlesex, England, UB10 9JB.   It provides certain information about him below which indicates that he was – he is usually a resident in England.  He is a British citizen and his date of birth is the 18t h of October 1974.      Certainly, Chair.  The second director is Mr Piyoosh Goyal.  His service address is 9 ...[intervenes]      [laughs]     Certainly, Chair.  At the bottom, you can see that the original email is sent from Rupesh Bansal at the email address replyrb@googlemail.com.   It is sent to a Yang(?) Minu(?) which his address is yangminu54642@qq.com.   It is sent on the 6 t h of January 2015.  And as we can see ...[intervenes]      It is January.     Correct, Chair.     And there is a six after the address.     That is correct Chair.     What we see is Yang Minu from that address, which we have just identified, sends an email to an address called Businessman of which infoportal1@zovo.com.  He is forwarding the message on the 7t h of January 2015 and the     Certainly.  Finally we have an email from Businessman sent on Sunday, the 22 nd of March 2015 to Ashu Chawla and it provides a subject forwarded which has two Chinese photos and then thereafter, it indicates there is an attachment, attached by email with the name of finalcsr2015workings.xlfx.       Chair, the email was located within the Gupta leak profile.     Certainly.  That was the document in an Excel spreadsheet that was attached to the trials of emails we have just seen.   Effectively, what this Excel spreadsheet works out is the number of or the value of kickbacks to be paid on certain Transnet contracts, in particular, what they refer to as the 359 Project, the 100 Project and the 95 Project which refer to the 95 Locomotive Project, the 100 Locomotive Project and the 359 Locomotive Projects.   And it indicates the total amount that have already been paid to various individuals, to various companies, in particular JJT and CJT, under the terms of those kickback arrangements and what remains to be paid.       Certainly, Chair.  What you have at the very top line of the spreadsheet is a heading providing an indication of what project is being referred to.  So 359, 100 refers to the 359 Project and 100 Project and then 95 Project and then the total. Underneath that, it provides a particular Rand value for each locomotive within that project.  So each loco value for the 359 Project is R 50.48 million, and for the 100 Project it is R 44 million and for the 95 Project it is R 28.28 million.  And underneath ...[intervenes]      Apologies Chair?     Certainly.  So the 359 Project was the supply of 359 locomotives and each – the R 50.48 million refers to the contract price of each locomotive within that contract.     That is correct Chair.     Yes.     That is correct.     And then the line below that, you can see it indicates Chair project value.     Which then gives a total value of that particular contract.     And that is the value of the contract as signed between the particular Chinese manufacturer and Transnet.     So ...[intervenes]      Certainly.  I will just have to double check my notes and make sure that I get it exactly right.  We have a 95 Locomotive Project and I am trying to just remind myself whether that is an electrical or diesel locomotive project which I will reflect very shortly. Chair, as far as I recall the 95 Locomotive Project reflects a 95 diesel locomotives.  They were purchased by Transnet.  And they were purchased from China North Rail, CNR, Hong Kong. The 359 Locomotive Project refers to the purchase of 359 electrical locomotives.  That was part of the original larger 1054(sic) Contract and those are purchased from China South Rail, Hong Kong. I should mention Chair that for the purposes today, that at a certain point after June 2015, China South Rail and China North Rail merged into a single entity which is referred to as CRRC.       That is correct Chair.     The 100 Project refer to the provision of a hundred diesel locomotives.  And as far as I can see from my notes, I have – that was a contract that was signed with CRRC.     Certainly, Chair.  At the third line, we have the project value which we have already mentioned.  The first value is of the 359 Project.  It gives the value as R 18.122 32 00,00.  And on the 100 Project it is given as R 4.4 million.     That is correct.     Sure.  It is R 18.122 32 000,00 in the first column under 359.  And the 100, it is R 4.4 billion.  And the 95 Project, it is R 2.686 60 000,00.  And then we have a total figure for all of those contracts together which is R 22 152 232 000,00.       Thereafter, we have an entry which says total receivables will be from CSR which stands for China South Rail.  For the whole project, it is 20% for 95 and 21% for 359 and 100. What they propose, it will become a little bit clearer below, is the portion of the total project value that CSR intended to pay over to JJT and CJT of which 15% was to go to CJT. And so CJT and JJT, for their particular fees for money laundering, and the remainder of that was to go to the Gupta enterprise.   So what we have here at that fourth line, is effectively a calculation of the total value of kickbacks to be paid on these three contracts.   The total value under the 359 Project is R 3.805 687 2 000,00.  The 100 Project would be a total kickback of R 924 million.  And the 95 Project, it would be R 537.32  000,00.  And then the total amount would be R 5.267 007 2 000,00.   So that was the total amount that would be paid out to the various recipients of kickbacks in relation to this contract. The line below indicates the amounts that have already been paid by the data of this particular working sheet, which at that point, which you can see it is a CSR has paid on the 6 t h of January 2015, which, if the Chair recalls, was the date on which the email was first sent by Rupesh Bansal. And it gives a figure of US Dollars for the combined figure for the 359 and the 0 contracts of 7.203 921 million Dollars.   And then under the 95 Project it provides a figure of – it is a little bit difficult to read without the decimal point in place but it is fine but as far as I can see it is 16.699 028 9 million US Dollars. And then the total figure combined of those two amounts is 123 903 822,89 US Dollars.  That was the amount that was already been paid under the terms of these kickback arrangements.       Certainly.  The line reads    Certainly.  This breaks down Chair the way in which the amounts, the kickback have been calculated.  What we see here is under the 359 and 100 Projects, it indicates that 21% is total receivables.  That is the total amount to be paid to CJT.  2% advanced success fees.  That is 2% of the contract value to be paid as a success fee and 19% receivables on actual basis that is due from CSR.   And there Chair, what that means is 90% of each milestone payment that is made from Transnet to CSR.   Under the 95 Project it is a slightly easier calculation.  They just refer to 20% of total receivables.  And then it gives a figure to the right which is R 5.267 007 200 000,00.   What this indicates Chair is that, very simple, that for the 359 and the 100 Projects, China South Rail was intended then to pay a total of 21% of the price paid by Transnet to JJT and CJT.  And on the 95 Project it was intended to pay % to CJT and JJT.       Again, that is R 5.267 007 200  000,00 Dollars(sic).  Apologies.  Rand, not Dollars.     Certainly, Chair.  What this line indicates is it refers to JJT/CJT and expenditures.  The effect of this is to describe the fee that was to be paid to JJT and CJT for carrying out certain – for receiving the funds and then just repeating them. It says here out of 2%, under 359 Project and 100 Projects indicates, out of 2% success fee, 1% success fee for JJT and 1% expenditures, which we understand to mean, 1% of the total contract value would be paid on the granting of the contract to JJT and 1% would be paid to the Gupta enterprise. Out of 19% CSR receivables, which is the 21% total contract value minus 2%, JJT receives 15% and expenditure is 85%.  So on this contract, JJT receives 15% of 19% and additional 1% of the total contract and the remainder is paid over to the Gupta enterprise. At the following line it says out of 20% receivables, CJT receives 15% and expenditure is 85%.  This again indicates that a part of the total project value, CJT would take a 15% share of 20% share of the contract value, while the remainder of the 20% would be paid over to the Gupta enterprise.     Certainly.  So the next line then provides a Rand figure breakdown.  The amounts that will be accruing to JJT and then under expenditures, what we understand to be the Gupta enterprise. Under the 359 and the 100 Projects as a combined figure, we have R 3.862 577 880,00.  And for JJT, we have R 867 109 320,00 .   Under the 95 Project, we have an amount of R 456 722 000,00.  I just want to make sure that is a hundred percent correct.  That is correct.  So it is R 456 722 000,00. And then of that, then CJT was to receive its own 15% which is equal to R 80 598 00,00.  And then the final row gives a total across those three contracts.   It is total expenditures i.e. the total amount that he paid to the Gupta enterprise under these calculations, would be R 3.908 250 008,00.  And for JJT and CJT, it will be R 947 747 707 320,00.       Certainly.  So expenditures then explains the – it effectively repeats to an extent of – to some of the previous lines.  It indicates the specific amounts that will be paid to the Gupta enterprise here.   So under the 359 and the 100 Projects, they were intended to be paid a 1% success fee which is...  I must double check I have got the correct decimal places here.  It is 21 903 000  Dollars.   And it says 85% of remaining receivables would be...  I have 554 132...     That is correct Chair.  If I may, I might just get a pen to mark the decimals to make it slightly easier to read?     [No audible reply]      Thank you Chair.     That is quality Chair.  That is 55 430 2097,75 Dollars under the 359 and 100 Projects.  And then under the 95 Project, we have an amount of 40 194 917,45 Dollars which was supposed to be paid to the Gupta enterprise. And then we have a total amount in US Dollars of 90 614 118.20 Dollars.  So that is the total figure that was supposed to be paid – remained to be paid to – that was to be paid the Gupta enterprise in relation to these three contracts.     Certainly.  So at the far right, we have the total figure and that is 33 289 705,68 Dollars.     Certainly.  We have notes in red.  And the     Certainly.  It says    That is correct Chair.     Certainly, Chair, this is an agent agreement that is dated the 13 June 2011 and signed between party A which has provided Shanghai Zhenghua Heavy Industries Co Limited and we will be referring to them tomorrow in more detail as ZPMC which is the alternate acronym for them and party B is JJ Trading FCE and it relates to a contract for two ship to shore container cranes including the repositioning of existing Noell Cranes, and additional 5 number ship to shore cranes for Transnet South Africa.  The name of the project is – the Transnet internal name for the project is iCLMHQ0762 which then is indicated as design, manufacture, delivery and commissioning of seven hand and lift ship shore cranes for the Durban Container Terminal, Durban, South Africa and relocation of two existing IMPSA ship to shore cranes from Durban to Port Elizabeth, South Africa.  And I should add here, Chair, this is a separate and distinct contract to the contract that was entered into between Transnet Port Terminals and Liebherr which we discussed on Friday.     That is correct, Chair.   What the agreement effectively arranges is for – incentivises JJT to seek to increase the cost of the contract to benefit ZPMC.     Certainly, Chair, it indicates and exclusive agency agreement entered into between CNR Hong Kong, which is China North Rail Hong Kong Corporation Limited, was Tequesta Group Limited.     Certainly, Chair, the date of agreement     Is Tequesta Group Limited, hereinafter referred to as TGL, a company duly incorporated and existing under the laws of Jebil Ali Free Zone and having its registered office at P.O. Box 17398, Dubai, UAE, duly authorised and represented by Mr Salim Aziz Essa.     Certainly, under product it reads    Certainly, so in clause 7 we have seven     That is correct, Chair.  Returning to 7.2    7.5 reads    313?  Yes.     Clause 12.1.3 indicates that for Tequesta Group Limited would be for the kind attention of Mr Salim Aziz Essa, P. O. Box 17398, Dubai, UAE.     Certainly, at page 315 the signatory on behalf of Tequesta Group Limited is Mr Salim Aziz Essa and for and behalf of CNR is Mr Ma Zhan.       Certainly.  This reads    Certainly, the date is provided at the top line, the date is the 20 May 2014 and under the parties it indicates for Regiments Asia hereinafter referred to RAL.  They are duly authorised and represented by Mr Salim Aziz Essa.     Certainly, under project it refers to the supply of locomotive and [indistinct] .10.26 parts in South Africa.     Certainly, under clause 7, 7.1 reads    Certainly under 329 it indicates that the individual who had received notice for Regiments Asia Limited would be Mr Salim Aziz Essa at P.O. Box 17398, Hong Kong.     Page 332, Chair, the signatory on behalf of Regiments Asia Limited is Mr Salim Aziz Essa for and on behalf of CNR Dalion Locomotives and Rolling Stock Company, it is Mr Zhu Zhi Jong(?).     Certainly, Chair, this is a business development services agreement entered into between CNR China North Rail Rolling Stock South Africa (Pty) Ltd, so as distant from its Hong Kong entity with Business Expansion, structure Products (Pty) Ltd and it provides a registration number for – what we refer to as BEX 09/020420/07 and the agreement date is the 25 April 15.     Certainly, it is the relocation of certain facilities that was requested by Transnet in relation to the production of locomotives and the substance of the contract is that BEX or Business Expansion Products would be incentivised to try and ensure that Transnet increased the amount that it was going to be paying to CNR way above the original stated amount, which was just under R10 million, and that any amount over a certain benchmark price, which is R580 million would be payable to BEX so it is an incentive on behalf of BEX to induce Transnet to pay a much larger amount than had originally been anticipated for relocation costs.     Certainly.  The original quoted price was slightly under R10 million.  It was, as far as I recall, R9.75 million and the benchmark price, which has actually increased on the previous contract is R580 million and thereafter, the amount that was to be earned by BEX, would be the amount over and above R580 million.  So if there were able to get Transnet to pay more than R580 million they would receive the additional amount that is paid.  That is clearly an adverse or prejudice to Transnet of close to - in terms of the benchmark price R570 million.     That is correct, Chair.  It appears at     Certainly, Chair, at 358 we have a business development services agreement between CSR, which China South Rail Hong Kong Limited with Tequesta Group Limited, or its nominee, with an agreement date of the 18 May 2015.       Indeed, Chair, it refers to project 359 and     Certainly, I will read out the full clause but the summary of the clause is that – summation of the clause is that at a certain point JJT and CJT were no longer used as the main – as the primary agents and they were replaced by in this case Tequesta Limited and that Tequesta would seek under its own powers to resolve any outstanding disputes with JJT arising.  Should I read the full paragraph?     Okay.  3.2 reads    Certainly, Chair, at 6.1.1. It reads    Certainly, it is describing that had already been paid to JJT and TJT up until the date of this particular contract and thereafter, with that amount deducted from the contract value, the amount that remained to be paid to Tequesta under this agreement which meant that by signing this agreement Tequesta was due to receive over R3 billion.     Certainly, it says under miscellaneous, it     Certainly, Chair, at page 375 we have Mr Salim Essa signing on behalf of Tequesta Group Limited, this contract was signed at Shenzhen on the 18 t h day of May 2015.     Certainly and the annexure A, there are six     Okay, so under 1, let me begin again, Chair. 1. Advise the company on the regulatory social, cultural and political framework in South Africa with respect to the project. 2. Identify the various opportunities of participation in various government and private projects leading to the short listing and focus on the current project as contemplated in this agreement. 3. Closely coordinate with the designated authorities to comprehend the applicable government policies and advise the company accordingly to ensure smooth execution of the project. 4. Provide consultancy on participating in the tenders and bidding processes related to the project on an ongoing basis. 5. Assist the company in negotiating with the client on pricing levels in relation to the project. 6. Assist the company in  increasing their footprint in government and private projects in South Africa.”     Certainly, Chair.  The clause thereafter     Chair, I would have to double-check my notes, I do not know the exact date but I know it certainly before this contract was entered into.     The date of this contract is, if I refer backwards, it is the 18 May 2015.     Certainly, Chair, this is a document that I procured – it is an annual return for Tequesta Group Limited that I purchased from the Companies Registry in Hong Kong.     The most interesting thing for me appears at – well, there is two potentially interesting things within this document.  The first appears at page 380 of bundle 6A and it provides the details of the loan director of the company and the loan director of the company is given as Salim Aziz Essa with the residential address of 2 New Forest Road, Forest Town, Johannesburg, 2193 South Africa.   Referring to the previous page, at page 379, we have the details of the company secretary, so this is the individual - the company that was filing the return on behalf of Mr Salim Aziz Essa and we will return to why this is interesting, I am sure, in a while, but it is worthwhile noticing the email address there is abbeylie@onlinecompanyregisters.com under the relevant – so that will become clearer a bit later.     Certainly, Chair, this is a document again that I acquired from the Hong Kong Companies Registry, it is From ND2A which is a notice of change of company secretary and/or director and the substance of this is that the sole director is identified – whose details will be changed, is identified at the first page and that is given as Salim Aziz Essa and on the following page, page 386, is an indication of the new director of the company and that is given as Aashika Singh with an address 233 Kua Namayigut Road, Dharapara, Solly Gungee Kokuta 70082, West Bengal, India. (all names spelt phonetically) I should note, Chair, I have neglected to mention that on the previous page they indicated the dates of this form is the 17 November 2016.     That is correct, Chair.     Certainly, Chair, at 388 we have a business development services agreement between CSR, Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Company Limited with Regiments Asia Limited and the agreement date is provided as the 10 June 15.     Certainly, Chair, and the project that reads    Certainly, we have – at paragraph 6 we have a clause 6.1.1.  Should I read the full terms into the record?     At 6.1.1 we have   Certainly.  Under clause 10.1.4 it indicates that the person, the contact person for Regiments Asia would be Mr Salim Essa.      Certainly.  At page 405, on that paragraph 11, indicates Regiments’ banking details.  The first entry is name of bank and branch which is given as HSBC Bank Head Office Central, Hong Kong.  It provides an account number which is 652353533-838.  The currency of the account is indicated as US dollars.  The account name is given as Regiments Agency Limited.  And then it provides a Swift code of HSBCHK4HOKH.      Certainly, we have the contract indicated being signed in Sandton on the 10 t h of June 2015, for and behalf of Regiments Agency Limited.  It was Mr Salim Essa.  And for and behalf of SCR, is usually Electric Locomotive, it is Mr Zhu Quinn Yi.      Certainly.  At page 407, the final clause    Certainly.      Certainly Chair.  Page 408 is annual return document that I secured from the Hong Kong company’s registry.  The annual return is dated the 20 t h of June 2016 for Regiments Asia.      The email address as provided again as abbeylie@onlinecompanyregister.com.    Certainly.  The sole Director is identified as Salim Aziz Essa, with an address of 2 New Forest Road, Forest Town, Johannesburg, 2193.      Certainly Chair, this is again form ND2A, which is a Notice of Change of Company Secretary and Director, which is dated the 17 t h of November 2016.  And the substance of this form which is then revealed on this page and the following page is to replace Mr Salim Aziz Essa as the sole Director with Ashiq Hussain.      That is correct Chair.    Certainly Chair.  This is an addendum to the already existing agreements signed between CRRC Hong Kong Company Limited and Chair if you recall earlier on in the evidence I noted that CRRC is the merge name of CNI and CSR.  Regiments, and that’s signed ...  (indistinct).    That’s correct Chair.  Regiments Asia Limited and Tequesta Group Limited and it’s dated August 2016.      Certainly.  It reads at clause 2.1   Certainly.  At clause 2.1 reads   It reads   Certainly Chair.  It indicates a series of invoice numbers on the left-hand side.  And provides for the invoice dates which run between the 12 t h of January 2015 and the 26t h of December 2015.      That’s for Regiments.  And the following one is for Tequesta.    So this is, sorry I should make it entirely clear Chair that the table I am referring to here is in relation to invoices that have be submitted by Regiments Asia.  And the following table which we will get to is the first invoices submitted by Tequesta.  As I was saying the final invoice here is indicates that it is invoice 127, on the 26 t h of December 2015.  It provides for the amount that had been invoiced by Regiments.   The amount that had been paid by CRRC and the amount that had been withheld by CRRC as surety against any particular, potential future prejudice to the contract.  But the, probably the most key amount is that the – at the bottom right-hand corner provides a total amount withheld by CRRC Hong Kong up until that date.  And that figure is given as $5 181 354,65.      Certainly.  We have a very similar table which begins with the invoice CSR001 with the date of 20t h of July 15.  Which then runs to invoice number 24, the date there is provided as the 2n d of August 2015.   Again we have a repeat of the invoice amount that had been submitted by Tequesta to CRRC.  The amount that had actually been paid to them.  And then the amount that withheld and again the most important figure appears rather blurrily at the bottom of page 424.  And that reads a total amount withheld is $9 963 156,23.    I do not appear to have a 425.1.  It might be in bundle B.    I think there probably is, because the, the only signatory appearing at 425 is Zhu.    I think I have a duplicate.      Certainly, this is an addendum to an agreement signed between CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotives and Regiments Asia Limited.  And it’s dated August 2016.     Certainly, at clause 2.2. it states   Certainly.  We have again a further table which is the indicates at the far left column an invoice number.  And then a series of dates, the first date is given as the 11t h of February 2015.  And the final date I am afraid is very difficult to decipher.    I am reluctant to hesitate to guess that that date, I suppose that the key issue is that the total amount of …    The final entry which I think is invoice 125.    That’s the last date.  And the amount withheld is ...  (indistinct) legible.    Chair, the total is then replicated as $4 357 543,94.      Certainly Chair, at that page we have the signature, the individual signing on behalf of Regiment Asia Limited, is Salim Essa.      That’s correct. There is one that is signed in Chen Chen(?) and the one that’s signed in Sandton.    This one does not seem to provide a place.    Certainly Chair.  Zhang Min Yu is a very senior executive at Chinese South Rail.      Executive.    Certainly.  What we see is a, we have hints from the Gupta leaks that they are increasing tensions between the World Window Group and the Gupta enterprise.  And that’s indicated in certain documents, including that by May 2015 for example the company Outclass which is a subsidiary of Worlds Window Group, is entry, is cancelling all of its various agency agreements and its co-production agreements with all of the Gupta enterprise companies.   There was an interview that was conducted with an alleged member of the Worlds Window Group by Abu Bongani(?) who indicated that there was some sort of falling out between the Worlds Window Group and the Gupta enterprise related to the disposition of funds, related to coal mines that the Worlds Window Group had invested in that were, were beneficially owned by the Gupta enterprise.    That’s correct.  Although I must correct Mr Chaskalson.  That the earliest agreement I have involving Tequesta is the 20t h of May 2014.      That’s correct.    Certainly Chair.  This is a document that emanates from the Gupta leaks archives.      What we have here Chair is an email that’s sent from Asha Chawla to Salim Essa forwarding a reservation, confirmation from the Oberoi in Dubai.  The reservation confirmation is for Mr Zhang Min Yu. The body of the email indicates that the guest name is Mr Zhang Min Yu and the arrival date is Friday, the 27 t h of February 2015.  And the departure date is Sunday, the 1s t of March 2015.      Certainly Chair.  We have a document that also emanates from the Gupta leaks archive.  It is sent from the …    So we have the individual from whom it’s sent is Saniel at HRT Services.  And it’s sent to Asha Chawla.  And the subject is, ...  (indistinct) now 17 t h of March 2015.      Certainly Chair.  This is a string that relates to the booking of a private air charter for a company of individuals who would be travelling to like now.     Certainly.  We have first passenger is Mr Rajesh Gupta or Tony Gupta.  We have Mr Salim Essa.  We have Mr Zhang Min Yu.  We have Mr Digaan Yuah. We have Mr Wang Jincheng(?).  And finally Mr Mokesh(?).      Yes.  He is a executive also of CSR.     He is also an executive of CSR.    Yes.  I’m wondering if I should know.      Certainly Chair.  At that page we have an email again emanating from the Gupta leaks.  It’s from Jacqueline Van Der Merwe at Oak Bay.  It’s sent on Thursday, the 8t h of October 2015 to Naziem Hower(?), cc’d to Asha Chawla and Wana Karagvan(?) and the subject reads SATY Stats at six o’clock, on 8 October 2015.  And SATY is the acronym for South African of the Year.  Indicating this is a statistics related to potential attendees at a South African of the Year event that was going to be hosted by Oak Bay and the Gupta enterprise.      Certainly Chair.  What we have here is an extract from the excel spread sheet that had been attached to the email from Jacqueline Van der Merwe, that I have just described.    Certainly Chair.  It is very small on the document, I apologise.  It is at row 173, it’s highlighted.  And the invitee is indicated as Zhang Min Yu.  And it provides an email address in the third to last column which is zhangminyu542qq.com.       That’s correct.    Certainly Chair.  This is another email emanating from the Gupta leaks.  We have an email from one Sarah Ben Hoian(?) at the Oberoi, Oberoi Hotels to Asha Chawla.  And the substance of the email is to confirm a booking for Mr Tony Gupta, Mr Rajesh Gupta and with an arrival date of the 24t h of February and a departure date of the 26t h of February 2015.    Certainly.  This is a email that is sent again as part of the Gupta leaks.  In this case it is from Asha Chawla to Sujay Grova(?) who we identified in our Estina related testimony as the Indian national who is employed by the Gupta enterprise, to manage their Dubai logistics and accountant, accounts.   And that provides the substance of the, of the email is to confirm the booking at the Oberoi Dubai from Ms Ashi Kasing(?) with an arrival date of the 24t h of February 2015 and a departure date of Thursday the 26 t h of February 2015.    Certainly Chair.  Again this is another email emanating from the Gupta leaks.  It is a reservation, it is sent from a reservation address for the Oberoi Hotels to Asha Chawla.  And the subject is reservation confirmation at the Oberoi Dubai for Anash Singh.      Certainly.  The date of that reservation appears on the following page 1123 and the reservation is for Mr Anash Singh, arrival date Tuesday the 24t h of February 2015.  And departure date the 26t h of February 15.    Yes Chair, up on the screen now.  Check your screen is operational.    This is the one of the spread sheets as provided for productions relating to Regiments Asia.      Certainly Chair.  What I indicate at 264 is that a total amount of $187 054 355,77 was paid to Tequesta Group and Regiments Asia.    US dollars, correct.    Was paid to Tequesta Group and Regiments Asia by China South Rail, China North Rail, Allien(?) Locomotives and Rolling Stock Company, a subsidiary of China North Rail and CRRC.      Certainly.  An analysis of annexure NN which is the HSBC documents.    Correct, correct Mr Chair.  It indicates that Tequesta Group Limited was paid a total of $61 394 694,50 by China North Rail, CRRC and CSR of which $15 234 248,00 was paid by China North Rail.  $2 704 159,00 was paid by CRRC and $43 456 242,00 was paid by China South Rail.      Certainly.  At 264 we, we might consider jointly Regiments Asia and Tequesta with us paid a total of $23 857 154,00 by China North Rail.  $70 461 947,75 by CRRC.  $89 206 842,47 by CSR.  And $80 120 982,50 by Dalian.      That’s correct.  And I think the correct amount is indicated at the bottom of the table at file, at page 266.    Certainly.  What we have here is the, I extracted it from the various HSBC bank statements, the payments that were made to Tequesta Group and Regiments Asia at HSBC Hong Kong.  In the first part of the table I indicate payments that are made by CSR, CNR and CRRC to Tequesta Group.  The first payment is indicated at the 7t h of August 2015.   And the final payment on the 1s t of June 2016.  And the second part of the table indicates all payments that are made to Regiment Asia by Dalian, CSR, CNR and CRRC.  The first payment indicates that on the 8t h of December 2014 and the final payment indicated as the 1s t of September 16.  And then the final part of the table breaks down total amounts paid to Tequesta and Regiments Group by each of those individual contractors.      That’s correct Chair.      This is a level of mental arithmetic I was not expecting to perform.  But it would probably be roughly 1,6 billion rand.      Today’s, I thought you meant in 20 …    Certainly Chair. This is a document that was compiled by the investigative generous group Ama Bongani(?).  The substance of this work which is quite brilliant is to identify and track the amounts received and paid to CJT and JJT and to Regiment Asia and to Tequesta against the anticipated milestone payments in relation to kickbacks that were paid by the various Chinese State Money Manufacturing Companies.      Certainly.  We have at page 1, I’ll load it up on the screen so it’s slightly easier to see.  This is a set of calculations in relation to the 95 Locos contract.  And the substance of this page is to track here – let me try zoom in quickly.  On the left here payments that are made on certain dates.   And then to track the anticipated kickbacks due on each payment and then to trace those kickback payments actually being made to various accounts.  You can see the arrows then point.  It’s quite a complicated spread sheet, but the substance of which is to indicate that the payments that we do know that were made to Regiments Asia, or to Tequesta or to JJT or CJT match exactly what we would expect to see in terms of the kickback milestone payments as described in the underlined contract or agreements.      That’s correct.  It’s subsequently replaced by CRRC.      Correct Chair.  So we have the date of a payment that’s been made.  The column B indicates the party that’s paying. Column C indicates the party that’s receiving. So this case we can see that on the 28t h of March Transnet paid to CNR, related to then column B gives the particular deal, the first two which is the 232 Locomotive contract.   And then it indicates here at column E that a total of R994 700 475,00 had been paid by Transnet to CNR and CRRC.  At column F we have a summary of the contractual terms between Regiments Asia and CNR related to this contract.  And it anticipated that there would be upfront on the first payment milestone a two percent excess fee that would be paid in relation to this contract.   The Honourable Bongani have then calculated the rand kickback due.  And it’s a bit difficult to – I can’t zoom in on the formula number, but the formula is effectively takes the column E figure and works out what two percent of the total amount Transnet has paid.  And under that calculation the rand value of the kickback that would be due for the success fee would be R198 940 093,00.  Then that get continue Chair, Chair …    And what we have that proceeds thereafter is it’s total of five payments that are made on consecutive days between the 8 t h of December 2014 and the 12 t h of December 14.  And these are payments that are made from Dalian Locomotive which is a subsidiary of CNR to Regiments Asia, in relation to the 232 deal.   And if we scroll here to the right, we have a record, because Abu Bongani also had access to a leak of the HSBC banking documentation.  They provide the total dollar amount that’s paid on each date.  And as we can see the five amounts here which were paid on two consecutive days.   The first was 3,5 – $3 599 998,00.  The second amount was $3 574 998,00. The third amount is $3 716 998,00.  The fourth amount is $3 649 998,00.    And that there is actually, if I may add a fifth payment as well.      That’s correct and as you can see on the spread sheet this is the HSBC transaction sheet.  It appears there.      So what we have here then is the total calculation of the amounts paid by CNR to Regiments Asia.  It’s $18 119 990,00.  And the calculation is then performed by Abu Bongani here which indicates the …    Oh apologies.    At column B, row 8.    Certainly.  It says ZAR or South African Rand paid at SARB rate on Transnet pay date.  So that is the South African rand paid to the South African Reserve Bank rate on a Transnet pay date.  And you can see there is a line that, a red line, I will show you the origin of that, but it indicates at row 8, column B, R192 323 762,00 which if I scroll back to the original calculation of the anticipated kickback is roughly equal, very similar in amounts to the rand kickback that they anticipated will be paid in relation to the success fee.   So according to this calculation by Abu Bongani I think we can pretty safely assume that the five payments that are made by Dalian on these consecutive days relates specifically to the anticipated success fee on this contract.       Certainly we have a total, the first payment is to Salim Essa who received a payment of 99 985 dollars and thirteen on the 26 t h of October 2015 and that was paid into an account held at Habib Bank in Dubai.  The second entry is for Bartholomew Diaz Domingo who was paid 665 257 dollars and eighty seven in eight payments between the 24 t h of December 2014 and the 9 t h of February 15 into an account held at Banco PPISA in Porto Portugal.  At C we have Antonio Palango Sangosango who was paid 665 243 and one cent in eight payments between the 23 r d of December 2014 and the 9 t h of February 2015, again into an account held at Banco PPISA in Porto Portugal. At B we have a payment made to Prachi Desai who was paid 21 214 dollars on the 22 n d of April 2016. At E we have Faizel Rashied who was 29 992 dollars and eighty nine on the 2 n d of November 2016.  We have Marc Y Yung who was paid 70 000 dollars on the 24 t h of January 2015 and then Chen Shwang who was paid 99 985 dollars and fourteen on the 16 t h of April 2015.     Certainly I think Salim Essa is relatively, his identity is relatively well established.  For Bartholomew Diaz Domingo he is a Angolan Entrepreneur and owner of a Angolan company by the name of Guppo Bartholomew Diaz.  The public records for Antonia Sangosango which I describe at paragraph 276 was appointed to the position of Director of Administration and Budget in the Angolan Ministry of Foreign Affairs in at least 2011 although I did indicate his personal LinkedIn page indicates that he held this position from at least 1998 and I indicate here in any event the payments made to Sangosango took place while he held public office and I make a gentle suggestion that the Commission maybe might need to alert the appropriate authorities in Angola so they may conduct their own investigations into the probity of the payments.       Prachi Desai is a Bollywood actress who performed at the wedding of A J Gupta’s son, Kamal Singala in Antalya, Turkey on the 23 r d and 24 t h of April 16.  As pointed out above she was paid 21 214 dollars on the 22 n d of April 2016, on the same day the organisers of the wedding Catalyst Entertainment Private Limited were paid 64 394 dollars and we can refer to the annexure which describes that event.     Certainly, Chair 1094 is a copy of a magazine which is called Excel which appears to be short for Experiential Celebrations, the copy, the issue number or the issue date is between July and December 2016 an the tagline for the magazine is “An Insight into the Business of Social Evens.”      Certainly it indicates under the heading Wedding Planning at page 8, Happening and then the title of the article is Turkish Delight the Multiplanner Managed Antalya wedding.     So the heading is “Turkish Delight”    We identified a payment of just over – I will get the precise amount from the bundle again, at paragraph 277 ...[intervenes]      Page 268, paragraph 277.     Here I indicate that on the same day that Prachi Desai was paid an amount of 64 394 dollars was paid to Catalyst Entertainment Private Limited.     It was the 22 n d of April 2016.     The 23 r d of April.     I think it is 1098, let me double-check.     Sorry, it is 1097 Chair.     Correct Chair.     And then it says on the left hand side of the page it says the exotic beachfront engagement.     And as you can see the second paragraph I     Certain Prachi Desai was paid 21 214 dollars on the 22 n d of April 2016.     Certainly sir we have table 4, recipients of over one million dollars from Regiments and Tequesta Holding, the largest recipients of funds was a company by the name of Almalucky Limited which received a total of 54 payments between the 12 t h of August 2015 and the 10 t h of October 2015 and the amount is 15.312million Dollars.  The second entry there is for Success Stan Limited which was paid a total of 13 539 115,30 dollars across 44 payments between the 19 t h of May 2015 and the 15 t h of January 2016.  The third entry is ...[indistinct] Garment which was paid in 38 payments 11 244 776,63 dollars and those payments are made between the 18 t h of August 2015 and the 15 t h of January 2016.  The following entry is for Shunshi Limited which was paid 7 198 747,16 dollars, across 22 payments between the 13 t h of December 2015 and the 13 t h of January 2016.        Certainly what this table indicates Chair is the – listed from the larges recipients to the smallest recipients of amounts totalling over a million dollars from Tequesta and Regiments HS accounts, the number of payments they received and the dates they received those amounts.     Certain Chair.  Morning Star International was a company that was also controlled by the Gupta Enterprise, they are most well-known because they received payments from Homex Pty Limited, the HSBC records indicate that they were paid in ten payments, they were all made between the 22 n d and 29 t h of May 2015 from Homex’s Mercantile Bank facility in South Africa and in total Morning Star was paid 393 965 dollars.  We know that Morning Star and  Homex were involved in allegations of impropriety in relation to contracts that were also awarded by Transnet.     Certainly the first company is Almalucky Limited, the second company is Success Stand Limited, third company is Meridian Warrior GL, the fourth company is Fly Bridge International DNCC and the fifth company is Silirtis Company Limited.     I believe that these three companies were all making use of the same money laundering organisation, and money laundering routes with which the funds paid in relation to kickbacks could dissipated.     Certainly I indicate here that following Tequesta Group’s decision to no longer use the HSBC accounts they made use of accounts at Habib Bank and I read as I state here - Bank statements made public by Amil Bongani have revealed that Tequesta Group Limited operated a US Dollar denominated bank account at Habib Bank in Dubai with account number 2012-7771698603.  T his account was used to receive three payments from CRRC between the 22 n d of October and 29 t h of October 16 valued at 19 886 383 dollars and forty one, and what is notable here is that this account was also used to make two payments to Fly Bridge International one of 198 876.33 Dollars which is equivalent to 755 000 Durham on the 28 t h of August 2016 and an amount of 735 000 Durham which is equivalent to 200 238 dollars and thirty five, also paid on the 29 t h of August 2016 also to Fly Bridge International.    Certainly Chair, what we have here is the documents that was ...[indistinct] by Amil Bongani it is a statement of account in relation to an account held at Habib Bank Limited and the owner or operator of the account is identified in the top left corner as Tequesta Group Limited and it provides the address for Tequesta Group Limited as Flat A, 16P, Effilia, which if we cross-reference back to the Hong Kong company registration documents is the registered address for Tequesta Group in Hong Kong, and it provides a statement of account in relation to the account number 20127771698603.      Certainly Chair this is a memorandum drafted by Mr K Naidoo who is the Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, from the Surveillance Department, the date of the report is or the memorandum of authority is the 10 t h of March 2016 and it is a proposed forfeiture – the memorandum is a proposed forfeiture of  money to the State in terms of the provisions of Regulation 22B of the Exchange Control Regulations, Sunnyside Import and Export Close Corporation and it provides a registration number for Sunnyside Import and Export.     Certainly Chair, this is a list of transactions that were recorded by the South African Reserve Bank in relation to Sunnyside Import and Export.     That is correct, these are payments from Sunnyside Export out of the country.     Certainly, what I have done here is identify all of those companies to which Sunnyside Import and Export made payments that also appear on the bank statements or the transaction records for Regiments Asia and Tequesta Limited.     There are 23 companies here.     Chair I believe that this is evidence of the existence of a complex professional money laundering organisation that served to launder funds both from South Africa and also served to launder funds for the Gupta Enterprise in relation to Regiments Asia and the Tequesta Group.     At paragraph 300 I state the receipt and dissipation of funds from the accounts happened in a highly suspicious manner in particular the funds paid in by CSR, CNR, Dallian and CRRC were paid out of the HSPC accounts almost immediately after they had been received.  In addition the amounts paid out by Regiments Asia and Tequesta had all hallmarks of smurfing, in which large payment amounts are  split into a series of smaller payments made contiguous with each other.  This is to avoid the movement of single large sums that may incur compliance checks or mandatory reporting requirements.  I then provide an example at paragraph 302 which provides indicative examples of this and the first example between the 31 s t of December 2014 and the 25 t h of March 2015 Regiments Asia transferred 2 984 050 Dollars to a company called the Light Forever Limited in eleven transfers but most noticeably between the 10 t h of March 2015 and the 24 t h of March 2015 Regiments Asia made ten transfers on a nearly daily basis, the transfers were mostly in round figures and then I provide a table here, thereafter Table 7, which indicates the payment amounts that were made from Regiments Asia to Light Forever and as the Chair will see here we have a series of payments that are made between the 10 t h of March and the 25 t h of March or within very close proximity all in round amounts and/or with all hallmarks of smurfing and money laundering ...[indistinct] administratively to transfers all of those amounts in one go rather than across a number of different transactions incurring transaction fees. In the second example which I indicate at paragraph 303 between the 18 t h of August 2015 and the 6 t h of November 2015 Tequesta Group transferred 9 087 002,92 to Almalucky Limited in 34 different payments, although realistically I must add that this was actually 33 payments, as one payment made of two dollars and ninety three cents.  The payments again took place on a regular basis often only a day or two apart and were roundabouts in a pattern that would be pretty indicative of smurfing and money laundering, again I provide a table of those payments beginning at the 18 t h of August 2015 and concluding on the 6 t h of November 2015.     Certainly, I say at 304 I say based on the above discussion the following facts can be confirmed, at paragraph A; Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group were paid 145 177 086,91 by CSR, CNR, Dallian and CRC seemingly after it was decided to get this ...[indistinct] window network to launder kickback payments.   At B; Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group were incorporated in Hong Kong shortly before receiving payments from CSR, CNR, Dallian and CRC. The Gupta Enterprise Associate Salim Essa was the sole director of both Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group until 2016 after which he was replaced Aashika Singh, another Gupta Enterprise associate.  The amounts paid in Regiments Asia and Tequesta Group were immediately dissipated out of these accounts. The payments made out of Tequesta and Regiments accounts were made to, one, a small wedge of individuals, two a large number of Chinese registered textile, clothing, bedding or consumer goods manufacturers, many of whom are shown by public customs data to have been shipments to South Africa or alternatively to have at least reported such shipments to customs authority in China.  Three, a large number of Hong Kong registered shelf companies all taking the same corporate form and none of which have any notable online profile.  At F; payments to Morning Star International are also reflected at Annexure NN as are payments out. These records s how that only five companies received payments from all of Morning Star International, Tequesta Group and Regiments Asia namely Almalucky Limited, Success Stand Limited, Meridian Warrior GL, Fly Bridge International DMCC. Silitis Co Limited.  At 305, based on the above facts I believe it is reasonable to infer 
PAUL EDWARD HOLDEN:   (s.u.o.) 
HOLDEN: Certainly. I understand from the Commission’s investigations that Businessman refers to Mr Salim Essa.   Yes that’s correct. I apologise, I misunderstood the question.  But that’s correct.    Analysis of the annexure shows that Regiments Asia HSBC account in Hong Kong was paid $83 781 589,22 by China North Rail CRRC, China South Rail and Dalian(?) of which $8 622 906,00 was paid by China North Rail. $40 757 788,75 was paid by CRRC.  $45 750 600,47 was paid by China South Rail.  And $80 119 990,00 was paid by Dalian a subsidiary of China North Rail.   
UNKNOWN MALE:  No.
