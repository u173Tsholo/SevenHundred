Margareth Waterboer,"The ‘Captured’ clan got the same illness so theft "@Sekaka Some advocates deal with a specific issue @JJ Elimimian What are you talking about...I can’t see that it deals with this inquiry.. "@Pastor J "Thx Gosh...what have we here... she’s so bewildered...and she works in SSA... GOSH Can’t handle... Is it really language tripping her up or incompetence to grasp questions...I mean she couldn’t even understand ‘it’s on the spine’.. I’m worried about such people in important work places... "Help me today...please dear father
Pastor J.J,I Pray and wish you all a safe and blessed day.........🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 "Soon. Very very soon Gary It has not reached our station as yet @Maryann Diamond @Elvis Malakoane ...She says that no one can see her chats. Is there a way to unblock her? @Margareth Waterboer ...Just block him. He seems to be ranting on about nothing. @JJ Elimimian ....Please stop your comments and chats about nothing. You are becoming an unwanted distraction. Please show a bit of respect for us people who want to focus on the evidence. No red high heels for me or the other men @Kingsley Masha /////hahahahahahaha @makhosi nobhatyi ...His track record thus far leaves a lot to be desired. But he may have a lot of pals on the same train as himself. Definately a HOT seat.@Kingsley Masha @Singi Mathebula ...Apparently his wife was 67 or so when she died. But I am suspecting that it was merely a political stunt to cause maximum embarassment. @Rufus Pretorius ...Sorreeee bru but who is Karen? Very true@mokopa . "@Gareth Hellyar ....Can we do @Eliot Chauke . If Zuma was elected directly by the public and not the ANC NEC I doubt he would ever have been elected to be president. Many dont regard him as their president. U are an exception @Eliot Chauke ...I respectfully but utterly and totally disagree with you. It was a typical case of a fairer sheep leading the goats to the slaughter.They had a smile on their faces sadly whilst being slaughtered. Thats like a cult @Eliot Chauke "@wim louw ...hehehehehe. The same Carl Niehaus that ""killed"" his mother to borrow money again!!!!!" @Jimmy Reddy ...A Beeeeeeg Amen to that. "Surrounded by a whole lot more of them Conmen. @Elvis Malakoane . Now working for Ace Are you serious?@Dominic Przybylski Yoh. Thats scary Whose funeral@Pansophical Sceptic hahahahaha.@Pansophical Sceptic . I believe his mother did die eventually. Eventually after about 5 ressuructions. I believe the 6th was not a success. Carl eventually gave up..@Pansophical Sceptic And it has niks to do with Eishkom it seems @Elvis Malakoane Like a Defect it seems. But a bad defect..@Elvis Malakoane A Perfect10 it seems....@Spider I wish she will not repeat the question and stick to the basic Yes or No.Will save a lot of time. @Smart Guys ...I thought she meant Cowbells...hahahaha "Now. It may be necessary to do a clearance and polygraph on this lady""s qualifications." @Oscar N ..You may be right about the talk and embrace approach if it has a positive and amicable outcome. Being antagonistic is not acceptable though. @Immanuel ....hahahahahaha We trust you fully @Kenny Innes 300%. hahahahahaha "When she said 'Standard 1"" was she talking about the infamous JZ?" Not at all my friend. We had MrX recently. I was wondering if they are discriminating against MrY and Z@Pansophical Sceptic @thabelo justice mulokwe ...That would be Mr Z Coming soon...@Pansophical Sceptic . We may also try and use Mr JZ for that one

"@Michael Kaudi Ms. Nokunqoba Dlamini DCJ has got a wonderful sense of humour "@Eliot Chauke You forgot the word ""Former""" @Elvis Malakoane Correct 😀😀 Looks like it What protocol? Does Ms Dlamini have a lawyer sitting there that she keeps looking at?

"@Oscar N Nokunqoba Dlamini "@Reinette Raubenheimer Nokunqoba Dlamini "@Diss & Dad ""That white lady ....."" Seriously?" "@Talent P Sibisi Sadly Yes @Michael Kaudi My yes is in answer to your question @Mbizo Slash She heard Mr X talking about Dudu Myeni's phone calls to his daughter. She probably doesn't want to be in the same position. @Pastor J You've got your Mr Y 😉 Next one will be Mr Z "@Dominic Przybylski She doesn't have money for transport
Michael Kaudi,who is the lady? "@Anne M. ok cool she's from state security for real??
Sthakathi Khumalo,Miss Dlamini is a whole mood😂😂😂 These questions are to test integrity and honesty "sadly
Gareth Hellyar,Eish!! I love the Judge. He is sooooo patient. Kate can get very irritated. "So Very scary thought. He must be well again. Can go to court now!! "And True Rubin. In if you have friends in high places. Does she understand what vetting means. 😂 @Pastor J Poor lady. Poor lady. I laugh if at the end of the day the Judge says that he doesn't think that State Capture happened. 😁 Geez. Who would want to apply for that job? My thought exactly!! #thoughts Blocking @Diss & Dad
Mangalani Mangalani,I get worried when the so-called educated people can’t understand simple questions.
Robert Russell,Please protect me from myself...... How doff is this woman?????? Mr Yoh....Yoh....Yoh !!!!!! @Dominic Przybylski and that was from the water scam..... how much did she steal from SAA??
Toibo wa Toibo Antimba,Am indebted Chair
Raymond Mabilo,u r confused ms Dlamini @fuzile dazana i agree with you.
Tulonga Henoch,Everybody seemed to be doing things the way they want it to be
funicanz,"She is actually correct that all employees at SOE's regardless of what position you hold you must be vetted and declare your interests quarterly "@Gareth Hellyar  @wim louw 😆😆 Ms Dlamini knows her story.
Nhlakanipho Yolanda M,😂
Dominic Przybylski,I'm late. Who is the witness and what is her role please? Thanks @Singi Mathebula @Thokozile Mokoenanyana In your estimation how many official members of ANC are not captured as a percentage? Ramaphosa is captured by consensus. Collective responsibility castrates leadership. @Thokozile Mokoenanyana Very interesting. You seem to be exceptional. Money Launderer Majola is now has a top job as a human settlement executive in the City of Ekurhuleni Yup. Check out Daily Maverick Corruption is so rife and so many people involved government officials know that Hawks/NPA will only be able to convict a tiny proportion of them. Only reason I can see is for them to be susceptable to blackmail in the future. How many questions were asked to check whether the managers were qualified to do the work they had been employed to do? Got to remember that Zuma and his buddies were trained/indoctrinated in USSR. Was she giving the personal info to Myeni? Waiting for next appearance of Mr Z from his secret location in Cuba. When is ms M going to testify? @Anne M. Ms M is rolling in the money she got from Mr X What I understand is that rr Z got only R2million from the cash of mr X so ms M helped herself to about R8 million of it.
Sandile Ntimane,I'm new to the inquiry...who's this lady and how is she implicated in the state capture its miss Ndlamini
Hennie Cloete,#Granny-any academic qualification should be seen as a stepping stone-practical exposure gives substance. #Eliot-dream on!!
Thokozile Mokoenanyana,Elliot Chauke keep on dreaming. JZ is the president of his cult NOT SA! @Chauke thieves masquerading as RET love JZ not us the voters and uncaptured members of the ANC Agreed @Cruda that's where he belongs @Dominic don't be fooled by rented crowds or instant members who know nothing about the ANC which are few in any case. People are victimised if they don't blindly follow I know since I am 1 of them. @Dominic Przybylski You can even google me. I nearly killed in 2007 for not supporting JZ and standing up to Ace when he wanted me to refuse the branches desire when they chose me above Thabo Manyoni. @Dominic Przybylski as Motheo regional chair which I won and 2 days after that 5 bullets rained into my house 2h40am. I was the 1st culprit to be after Polokwane as chair of a potfolio committe in FS
clive oconnell,@Cruda Just goes to show I’m right voters should have IQ test to vote. This is hostile wittiness or stupid
RC Swart,who is testiying now?

Colleen Arezio,I'm sorry but this lady does not give me the confidence that security personal should have. Was she vetted for her position? I doubt it. Malema would never come with animinity attached because he wants people to see and hear HIM. He wants to portray no fear.

Pansophical Sceptic,Did someone mention Carl Niehaus? Isn't he busy attending a funeral... I don't think he's yet decided Pastor What again? I think perhaps the SAA should have vetted the SSA. Polygraph? None of them would have been employed 🙄 Analysis? This is starting to sound like a thriller @Santjie. Let's all hope so @Dave sinclair. Lipstick and pigs as they say... Ain't no way that's gonna happen Gareth @Granny mokwena. What state security? Does the polygraph have back up batteries? "@dis and dat. Yeah a cutting one 🤣🤣🤣 @Andre. Absolutely. That's why she's so feared by these crooks @diss and dat. Come on she's got an exceptional mind Yeah dis and dat is getting unnecessarily personal here. @Andre. lol you just destroyed his argument 😀 @Oscar N. Why would you want to embrace that? Great Question Joe @Oscar. Thanks for clarifying 100 managers. That's more than the aircraft This witness has a masters degree??? Concluding Stage. Anyone got any thoughts? @Cruda Bex. Do I hear jail then? I can't believe the country is run by such people? Well actually I can 😁 X and Y. Does this relate to a poly graph? @pastor J Can't wait till we get to Dr No then Pastor! All starting to sound like alphabet soup! Cluedo's got nothing on this game 😀 @pastor J. lol we are gonna have to brush up on quadratics to solve this one folks
