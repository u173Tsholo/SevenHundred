Tlome Pebane,zondo wee
Thabang Ntuli,zondo
Waterbearer,We need an Inquiry launched on the Zondo Commission’s time keeping Lots of people have committed perjury at this Commission. I hope they get arrested if only for that. The NPA has to be that pedantic These recordings illustrate a Board that is deep at sea Zondo nguNondaba kodwa
Mathapelo Mokadi,"Hey guys they taking long lunch now Only 6 months left "And they must not request another extension is too much now  Indeed Betty things are heating up now "Gororo that's what we know  "@ Betty 
GB,but things are heating up.... Indeed @ Mathapelo Mokadi. Eskom this week. wonder who's in for a grilling tomorrow.. Mr Tsotsi sure is connected! All the big names... ok @Mathapelo. looking forward to the grilling of these crooks who have harmed us @Thembhani Hlayisani - I also get that vibe.. Thuli Madonsela said that there will be prosecutions resulting from the state capture commission - she said so quite recently. @Shabba Shabalala there's the problem. As soon as you become President - too much power and then thing s go pear shaped @Canis Africanis. I concur. Must be sweating bullets now.
꧁༒ Wolfy Cs SniperEye ༒꧂,​@Abanob Boba I read intermenstrual flights 🤣

Mr L,what time is the commission resuming?
gororo14,This is just an inquiry nothing will be done
Thibos Mahoana,2020 the year of all trueths
Lina Joel,/
Siyabonga Ncube,"This is worrying
S V 1,Tsotsi never once asked the minister why executives who have done nothing wrong had to be suspended ..fishy ? The Guptas decided who sits on the boards .. stooges suited them .. they will follow instructions
Frank Jordaan,Jongi looks like all the shenanigans at Escom took place late at night. The decision on the prepayment of R600m to the Guptas also took place late at night Thembhani he is not spilling all the beans. Mzolisi the big issue with him is that he was at the beck and call of Tony Gupta. Why did he said how high everytime the Guptas said 'Jump'??? Blake I will never do that😜😜😜😜 Jongi😂😂🤣🤣 Shabba you have my vote.
Ruvi P001,it is strange 🤔
Thembhani Hlayisani,I wish he can tell the DCJ why did they meet at midnight. I have a strong feeling that he is also not dishing out everything that transpired at the meetings.
Wesley M,"is it Romeo khumalo from back in the day high life chat board members is it Romeo khumalo from Metro FM?? do you know? Erick Mgiba are you saying yes to my question? thank you Eric "thank you life chat board members Mr Tsotsi you were in it for MONEY!! TSOTSI!!!! Chair the once removed was also in it for the money 💰 "Bible "" the love of money is the root of all evil""" when are we going to get the Gupta's from Dubai? they have finished our money by now "when are we going to get the Gupta's if we do away with the ANC they will be arrested they will also have to arrest Ramaphosa he is at least an accomplice.
Brian k,this old guy was used by big Guys in the gvt
Eric Mgiba,Yes Wesley Myburgh No problem @Blake Yogi remember Matona testified that there was in-fighting among board members
Blake Yogi,Has this guy turned state witness? I was busy teaching a class now Im totally lost in these proceedings since lunch Yes I do I was expecting other witnesses. He said he only needed 45 min but now I hear Chair saying we have too much to canvass now. 😱 @Frank dont disrespect ubaba 🤣 eskom 🤣
EMANUEL KGAPHOLA,Eric mgiba is answering question of Romeo khumalo wesley myburgh mzolisi kolwani but how because it was underground
Mzolisi Kolweni,But guys he should have known He has been clever to turn to state witness
Mandlakapheli Norman Krakra,"Blake its evident that he did This dude is confessing Its Mr Tsotsi "Yes sir Jongi (lol) "Bongiwe "Wesley....not just the ANC too

Robert Maseka,👌
Stanley Sithole,Mr Tsotsi can't be trusted "This commission is useless
Phillip Cwazibe,@ Jongi Cayalli it meant 2031 @ Shabba Shabalala I will happily lock the handcuffs and certify them functional. @ Luyanda Cwane Eve corrupted Adam. That is where it started. @ Bonginkosi Zondi ​ disagreeing with board members is not wrong unless it includes criminality. @ Ghost Mapetla ​ some are more equal than others.
Bongiwe Moeli,"@sims nyandeni "@mandlakapheli "@rasikhuthuma read the book "Listen to these voices!! How they all thought they were intelligent and had the power. Shame "This will make a gripping script for a movie indeed. Don’t know much about Tshediso Matona "@MIke Durban I don’t trust any political party  @Shabba that’s what they all say for our votes🤔 "@Shabba on point "Yes Mike Durban "@Deon Meyer "@Mike Durban "Shabba RM they should stay away from public office period!!! "Luyanda we mobilize and get signatures Zandile we just need to appoint the right people who are protected from political interference. Ministry or government should not been shareholders. Deon Meyer maybe not private but an independent panel system that comprises public and private on a rotation basis "The Chair is not a spring chicken Where is Shabba? Deon we need to take this forward to a platform where we continue to converge ideas until we agree on the next big step!! Agree it can’t just be left here "Teddy Weekend entertainment Fred "Ndieni they have only scratched the surface Mondli then Zondo is going to be investigated for dragging and wasting tax payer’s money.
Sandile Mkhonto,Why was he having a office at Eskom? I thought he was supposed to be independent Chairman.

ndieni rasikhuthuma,How do people qualify for these boards it looks like only or mostly stooges are brought in it’s shameful And the details are quite shocking we entrusted our assets to the hyenas Zondo commission should be given all the time and resources to expose these shenanigans even if law enforcement agencies do nothing but what we know now we know Bongiwe I’m aware that corruption at municipalities is 100 times more than national and provincial those people are eating like there’s no tomorrow
Mondli Nohashe,"There are a lot of truths here waste of time & money agreed this is just gossips other TV channels no longer have live coverage of this nonsense this is just also a contribution to looting of state funds this is a joke Seconded Bongiwe Problem lies with the voters whom will tell you about the ANC of Mandela Tootsie has finished and he was the main actor of this movie wayforward is important Ei ! I doubt that this commission will be finished on the prescribed time. Process is very slow & there are always new revelations & a lot of adjournments. Time is being dragged Zondo will apply for another extension Suspects will survive the prosecution it can be better Bongiwe Ei ! All these people know each other from ANC as per Tsotsi 's statement These people are on the same whatsup group/ Birds of the same feathers fly together Oh ! what a delay now. Same yesterday questions about the meeting called by Dudu Previously. The main table in an ANC Galler Dinner is being occupied by the Top Six & sponsors. Tsotsi is not a Top Six member. How did he sit in that table if Eskom was not a sponsor ? Guptas & SABC represented by Ms Tshabalala on that table as sponsors . Question . What was Tsotsi doing in that table if Eskom was not a. sponsor ? Yes. Tired Age also counts 😁😁
Samuel Skosana,What are we (Jan Publiek) going to do about this looting??? "No Why has there been no prosecutions yet "Surely we as tax payers must be able to do something Nobody will ever appear in a court of law. Shame! This happened under his watch Spot on Shabba "Come on you guys Thry get a T shirt and told where to make their cross Let us agitate for this referandum. We have some time now They will change their colours when they see the $$$$$ This Chair is fond of his ajourments
Hloniphani Ndlela,Who is the Producer..Director & starring in this state capture movie.?
Thulani Faku,thieves chairman
Dj RoB-Era,there will never be any prosecutions and never any arrests for their corruption. This is all a play for the public to try and show that they are sweeping out corrupt Ministers and Members .
Maselwa Boikanyo Marcus,They should've hired Jub Jub to do this work.
Pheladi Lamola,What are they trying to achieve with these audios being played? Are we now trying to prove that the board lied about Mr Tsotsi or what? Ngubane with his arrogance 🤦‍♀️
Ayanda Ntshebe,waist of tax payers money
Nokutenda Royal,"@Dj RoB-Era you are very correct they will never be any prosecution for sure
Sigadawane daniel,:oops:AQAaa
Luyanda Cwane,South Africa...CHANGE is in your VOTE. OLD devil is no longer relevant! We don't need political parties anymore We need a coded robot with set rules...period! Who got us into this political party government system. SYSTEM CHANGE is the solution! Corruption started when our forefathers got their cows and land stolen. Right people are always overthrown by powerful people. We need a coded robot to run this country. WAY FORWARD...SYSTEM CHANGE!!! "Common sense Why Eskom installs electricity in illegal built dwellings in Cape Town? "So "Tsotsi means a thief "EDUCATION has failed Eskom We already have Nuclear sitting at Koeberg. Its now aging to kill us anytime if something goes wrong! Old people are failing us! "We need new blood "A bond that costs R500 000 China and America are talking DIGITAL Currency ...SA speaks looting!!
Salome Seabi,a big joke @ Shabba 4 president guys @shabba my vot 4 u @MEyer yeb laughing again "anc messes all SOEs anyone who will vote 4 anc isblind to the current affairs @Mabona but Ramaphosa has already given prima facie statement that incrimate anc in corruption. is that not a fact enough not to deter anyone from voti ng anc? that incriminate "the chair giving preliminary findings all facts point to zumas selling state power to the guptas by curry zuma where r u msholozi. uphi umshin wakho
Deon Meyer,Who is running the show?Tsotsi? "We need business people to manage Municipalities "The power belongs to the people.If the people decide that they do not want politicians to manage Municipalities "Then another suggestion I am so glad to read that the majority of the contributors agree that we need change NOW.Whereto from here? Agree 100%Bongiwe.

Teddy Ntsente,"I have great respect for Judge Zondo. He is sober-minded "@Bongiwe Moeli ""OVERALL""." "Tsotsi is an unapologetic member of the ANC. How could he have declined the invitation to attend the ANC's Gala Dinner "@Mondli Nohashe yesterday he mentioned that the table of 10 people was occupied by the top six @BOIKANYO MOLOI 100% correct. Tsotsi can be excused now... he looks tired.
Fred Desrosiers,today the government is run like a Mafia. Same method. "money for education
Bonginkosi Zondi,The line of questioning portrayed Mr Tsotsi as this innocent Chairperson of the board but fails to reveal instances where he openly disagreed with his board. It is possible he was such a chairperson "I am inclined to agree with you Brian. Phillip Cwazibe
Ghost Mapetla,Is our judiciary system a wallpaper or others are just immune In our lifetime we wont be able to have functioning country because our leaders dont love this country but see it as a mule to be milked while they fill there pockets ESKOM dose not have a problem but greedy people Is not education but the pure will to fatten there pockets in the expense of our country and when they done they announce a recession
