My daughter's classmates never saw each other in race terms till grade 3. Now as grade 6s they have split along racial lines and they are hardening @Pastor J Some voodoos like Bafana Bafana are not deserving of prayers. You just watch the voodoo unfold as it would @LYD online tv The chief of the airforce of SA @Aniceth De Missamou The pastor has said his prayers retired with him "@LYD online tv No @LYD online tv He was too high to handle landings @Aniceth De Missamou I am just teasing brother @matt kumalo Can't the team just call in sick on the day "@Sofia Sofia No @LYD online tv so they can embarrass us @Legae Nyalungu Have you forgotten how clueless they were is small Lesotho?

All I see him do is protect someone .... @Nyasimi Geoffrey LOL NINJA LOOOOOOOOL Awwwhhhh Shame ! @Yolo More LOOOOOOL If he feels so deeply about this HE SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING ASK him how was the biryani ? @Abel Matshidiso If he don't give us the truth will ANYONE else give us ? Or have we simply lost ? I guess if he has to be honest he will have to pay back his share of the pie which is probably eaten already ! I read in the news Agrizi dint have enough evidence ...What does that mean for this inquiry? @Yolo More he got no more to tell @kaapstad18 Another one of Zuma puppets Big Titles for nothing !

Felix Muyoba,this guy alone can topple a rogue gvt.. @Piet Fourie no man no piet fourie is a typical boer..
Piet Fourie,MK were waterboys for the Russians Their lack of skills amazed the Russians they were sent in droves to Russia - only to return none the wiser @pius194 hahahaha well my lunch is over - I'm out of here!
funicanz,This guy is worth listening to. @Lex Luger 😆
Derek Main,"@Piet Fourie If they were trained by the Russians @Lex Luger OK - thanks for the heads-up. They should have refueled the plane at OR Tambo and sent it back to India.
Elton Bruce Thindwa,@Piet Fourie Dont abuse your freedom of speach .your Uncle was a water boy for the SADF @Piet Fourie Typical Coward personar @Pastor J Bona it makes my blood boil
Dominic Przybylski,Recently SANDF took part in a tank wargame competition in Russia. SANDF came last by a country mile. Everyone now knows that we are useless as a military force. In 1994 I celebrated because I believed we would all see each other outside of the prism of race. But race now has a higher profile in our communication than any other aspect of ourselves. Sad. "We need a culture of individual responsibility """We do not have enough people who stand for what is right."" Summarizes the whole sorry mess." Chief of defence force would be cadre-deployment without a shadow of doubt. How could this man handle a real war if he was overwhelmed by a single incident in CAR and one helicopter crash? He rehearsed this 20 times infront of the mirror this morning. That's what it looks like to me. The buck doesn't stop in this country @Michael Wild Still haven't set up the checks and balances. How long does it take? The people at the top level of our country don't seem to be concerned enough to act upon anything except their own pensions. Interesting that our chief of the air force appears to be wearing a Chinese uniform. DIRCO is organisation for international relations and the sergeant-major... major cannot testify in English but was promoted to that organisation??? This man speaks like a dishonest politician. He doesn't speak like a military commander. Should never happen again - What does the promotion of the individuals involved say about it. It is SUPPOSED to be there to defend us. The people with integrity were kicked out and the people who were corrupt were promoted. That's what I got out of this testimony.
pius194,"piet fourie stop undermining black intelligence
Anne M.,@Sofia Sofia Same position he has now "@Nelson Musoliwa No @Nelson Musoliwa 👍
LYD online tv,@Lex Luger how are you buddy? @Lex Luger who's the witness? @Lex Luger is he the one who let the Gupta landing? @Lex Luger Interesting! 6 months as Chief sounds like a lot of time on the job. Chair is now deliberating...!!! @Thami Ngwenya I agree with you @matt kumalo I think the players have won though... @matt kumalo R320k each... @Sofia Sofia Yes he was one on the drivers in the Land Rover. @matt kumalo yes they got paid R320k each for getting to the ast 16. How Lucky?! CHIEF is protecting someone. I wanna hear what came out the preliminary investigation. lol David Mahlobo was Minister of Security Cluster mos... @Mulunghisi Mulunghisi another JZ stoogie. @Mulunghisi Mulunghisi Chief of the Airforce @Pheladi Lamola asked myself the same question. EVIDENCE LEADER got him! @Richard Andani Democlish Jarana he's caught now. lol @carnoth ngomane because Zuma is coming next week. They are playing it safe not to be exposed. lol @Yolo More CROOKS Indeed! @Abe Molefe True! "Chief Zondo is like He's telling us nonsense! That's their job mos. @Mike Meyer EMOTIONAL Blackmail. He knows he's on TV. @Pheladi Lamola I'm glad he's done. What a torture!
Pastor J.J,"We abandoned Apartheid reading some of these chats more especially challenges me everydAY EMOTIONALLY AND DEEPLY SPIRITUALLY @Dominic Przybylski . It seems that the more we try and convince ourselves that we need to embrace each other the more i meet people on the chat that reminds of the past. very sadly so @Lex Luger . I actually did but it seems that my prayers do not work anymore since i retired this year @Thami Ngwenya . Yes Thami but some of our brothers are so blatant on this forum and the rascist comments are deeply painful @Aniceth De Missamou . Yes yes I will heed your advice @Kapn Krunch . He actually qualified and practiced as a lawyer in johannesburg and continued his study in prison.
Thami Ngwenya,who is perpetuating race card "Pastor "Where does this race card emanate from in this group.It is when people calling name like stupid followers "Guy is lying this GUY MUST BE SEROUS "In China This guy double liar "He needs my lawyer "They are two Evidence leader not sharp The guy is all over not leading "Lamola that my point Lock him he will speak the truth
Queen K,Dominic Przyblyski the mouth speaks from the abundance of the heart..it’s who they are.
Yolo More,"Old school gentleman "Nelson Musoliwa the pink ones The chair sees through him. I said this guy is full of himself. "Ewald Kruger "Watson Mutanga "Yes chair He has been trying to escape all the questions. "Thami Ngwenya "'Yewena "Nyasimi Geoffrey Look at him. He thinks this is a joke. A poet He must go to 7 deLaan this one. No seriousness at all for his position. "Abel Matshidiso Thami Ngwenya she is feverish. Otherwise she is brilliant. "YES CHAIR "Carnoth Ngomane Carnoth Ngomane 😂😂 Sofia Sofia he must come back. We miss him. PREACH General. You want all of us to listen to you but you don't want to respond to the questions. Stop him now chair. "Makhosi Nobhatyi Hahahaha Chines collar "LYD Wheeee! Will you please SHUTUP already. DONT justify NONSENSE Tsek China man Stop this nonsonso chair You said nothing All want is the truth Big ups to our smart DCJ.
Nelson Musoliwa,Will this testimony not compromise military security of the country? Thanks Anne for clarity No best system can be safe from unscrupulous people; instructions from above confused the standard operation procedures More unfortunately one must not swallow more than what can chew; learn we have and very fast time is of an essence. Trust and integrity can not supersede standard operation procedures; this guy is confining himself to military oath of not giving away your commanders. Our officialdom is vastly manned by spoiled brats as this commission revealed thus far. Just leave him go he is useless for this commission What was the cabinet actions on this matter where Zuma was a chair of meetings as a president or leader of state If this doesn't indicates a banana republic status then i do not know Evidence leader is weak on this witness today; seems she didn't prepare adequately Zuma was so stupid he thinks being a commander in chief of the army his words are also commands so he gave word that his guests must land at Waterkloof base
watson mutanga,@Nyasimi Geoffrey: Do not expect respect from an individual who doesn’t respect themselves. Zuma is such an individual. @Nyasimi Geoffrey: He started by dismantling institutions of government. These stood in the way of corrupt practices. "@Dominic Przybylski: I agree. One of the solutions is for each adult to find themselves. Most people lack social and emotional intelligence @Yolo More: that’s down to perception. One can say that the guy is confident and or passionate. @Kevin Allister Simon: I agree. Corruption thrives when institutions are weakened. The corrupt start with dismantling institutions - for their gain.
Aniceth De Missamou,@Pastor J you should fast and repent @Pastor J for your prayers to be answered. "@Lex Luger it's dangerous "The reason ""Checks and balances"" are not there so they can get away with anything. For how long that institution has be established that there's no such? The Army is always well organised anywhere."
Richardt Human,Chief of air force but taking no responsibility at all. Passing the bug. Pathetic leader of the Air force. Suurstof dief. Our country is at huge risk with this guy being in charge of the air force. Who is going to suspend this guy and when. The plane should have been intercepted and forced to change route to either Pilansberg or Lanseria..
Neville Watson,Number one gave instructions period "How can we trust this guy with our country They nearly take over our country and then they wake up shame This lady is leading this guy
Ewald Kruger,Yip! @Richardt Human ​bChief of air force but taking no responsibility at all. Passing the bug. Yip @Yolo More. He is a slime ball like Zuma. No @watson mutanga. He is trying to manipulate the attention away from himself. Slime ball. "Exactly @Yolo More ​ Ewald Kruger The leader is laughing...WOW... 😀 😀 😀 @Nyasimi Geoffrey ​ This is how power speaks by the way i can see power in this man.....those long pauses and that deep reflecting Camera zooms in so we can feel the TEARS 😀 😀 😀 Kraaist Jesus this is f@cking embarrassing to watch. Well-rehearsed and re-arsed Instruments...matrix...evolution... 😀 😀 😀 Jissas this guy is a *anker of format.
Gareth Morgan,whos this guy he is making excuses
Thembelani,this oke thinks he can throw wool over Zondo's eyes This is a politician not a military man
President Matt K,we have lost.... we facing Egypt. R320k....?????😫 now we have really really lost they should have kept the prize money secret.... you know us south africans
Legae Nyalungu,answer the question Chief..they knew the correct process but deviated from it. "Chief people we are not safe "if we are attacked tomorrow

Zinhle Cindi,"These checks and balances seem to be the 'scapegoat'
Daniella Morgan,You cannot work on trust and integrity. You work on policies and procedures! No matter who made the error in the line of command - you as the leader remain accountable!! does matter if someone is new!!! there are policies and procedures. He is a useless leader.
Khaya Nomoyi,"As Chief of Air force "Even if the Col was new The system was fine its only that corrupt individuals manipulated the system for their own benefit.
Andani Jarana,"As the Chief Of the air force he did not get involved before but he is getting involved now LMOA @Phillip Cwazibe thats what he claims hahaha @Abel Matshidiso he said he had no involvement of that particular operation hahaha what steps did you take chief..
Dish,"yeaahhh the okes are having a big party. laughing doesn't seem to be much of a disciplinary to me. deep reflecting or deeply decieving
Jonas Mtsweni,they don't checks and balances even now
Robert Russell,In China he would have been hung for treason Unfortunately neither education or prison seem to be available anymore..... @Kapn Krunch Next a Molefe cry baby show from him You have to be fucken joking..... put my life in his hands.... never@Mandela's child vryhied I had the privilege of being under the command of Jan Breytenbach who is a retired career South African Special Forces military officer. "He is best known as the first commander of 1 Reconnaissance Commando These are the type of people we need in the defence force not clowns and actors well you are clearly not one them this is his state of the fuckup in the airforce speech Tsek.....

carnoth ngomane,So it wasnt the right thing to do then i guess it was funny for him So even today this guys are scared to say they acted on Zuma's instructions @Shadrack N i guess you are correct hence they cant point a finger at him "@Yolo More i doubt if he will be useful @Yolo More Zuma doesnt CARE @makhosi nobhatyi i guess its a reward for allowing the plane to land @Yolo More he's trying to do some damage control
Phillip Cwazibe,@Richard Andani Democlish Jarana he was new in the post and did refuse permission for entry. Wonder whether the same flight would be possible over China. @Keith keith ​My this guy said no in writing. Who authorized it after that is a glaring question.
Wilson M,this!
Ben Cole,No laughing matter. There were no consequences. No one fired. Only some promotions. Gut wrenching to see how lightly S African citizenry is treated and taken. The evidence leader fails to ask how the promotion was possible if there were two lieutenant ranks and one captain rank to hurdle before getting to the major rank. Called damage control and sympathy mongering. Nust can't get himself to call it a national disgrace
Kevin Simon,"The problem here is a cultural one. Not Black or White but an organizational one of a documented formal structure and then the one that really worked Ministers don't count!!! Missing the point! Not approved since 2013!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEARS obviously Bloody bureaucrat! Already the proposal sounds so complicated you'll spend time retraining and getting no work done. "Uh stammering Stop making excuses. The staff screwed up. Clear as day. Next witness please. That's why we have an army and airforce. Get on please. Yessss… moving right along
