Antonie Goosen,Murphy's Law ? "Jou Ma se Juliass
Pheladi Lamola,I take it the DCJ has the names of these code names being used Yeah but these ANC cadres were overdoing it while throwing it in our faces. It didn't help that they looked untouchable because they had made sure law enforcement was nonfunctional
Makwa Choma,I wish people listen n see this nonsense corrupt ANC No arrest will happen here is just ANC playing us fools Now Ramaphosa sending delegation to go and apologise to the Drug Lord to come back n destroy our youths Apologise for Xenophobia n attacking Nigerians True Ndlovu that shows you ANC is out of touch with us I hope so Morena Mashilo Heey Bathong we are tired about this ANC Anc is playing with fire the day we get tired of all this nonsense we will show them This is not Zuma but ANC in action
Mbuso Ndlovu,There is country in the world which is corruption free Even if they arrested they will live like kings in jail will have everything Jail is like a free Bead and Breakfast to the politicians Appologise for WHAT???? We do not need to appologize for saving our country and youths What is the alternative???? AKON??? "They are scared of Zondo They have nothing to loot Julius can lead us better That guy from Esteener dairy farm must come back for more grilling The cows were dying like flies there TAXI????? @Gee Peex1 Its suprising how soon their stollen monies got finished Why Guptas are not assisting him?? All the money that was looted will eventually end up into lawyers pockets "Imprisonment will not bring back the money In the meantime send them into skwata camps feed them soap and two slice I can type 100 words per minutes @Anne M. The problem with South Africa we take so long to act We even bribe them to give us a world cup which we benefited nothing from it. What a waste Zondo is prillage he wants to start wok at 10???
Marcus Mmola,I hope somebody big or well-connected is arrested for our sake. At least something will be seen to be done look at vbs
Mandisi BZ Tsengwa,please go home Nigeria We don't need you here
KLAAS MASHILO,its a pity that we are led by leaders who cant differentiate between the ruling party and the state..they can even defend others with their backside. we have been putting up with this and we are not stipid..they will regret this oneday. granted... they must all go and spend a night at informal settlement and listen if they wont be scared by guns totting at night.
Born free,stupid not stipid it's a hot day who doesn't like aircons Yes very credible A lawless country.. what a shame The ANC unfortunately will never be voted out their are millions of ignorant people who will vote for them. Then there is intimidation tactics that the ANC will use. We are already there.. Zimbabwe

Kevin Simon,Immanuel: seconder?: You're on your own. "Thomas Herman ​So this is a South African thing? I am from the US and none of our news channels even report on this Thomas Herman ; Perhaps FOX news will cover tRump's impeachment hearings. Hopefully these pastors are praying to keep the culprits out of jail. These guys seemed so busy looting they could not have done much work.

zintle ndzwangu,@Immanuel Hahahahahaha i can almost remember the story. How did yal figure out he is fake tho? How far are we from becoming the next Zimbabwe? @Born free I think so too.. Im just in denial @Lorraine Naidoo 😤 @Mbuso Ndlovu Hahahahahahahahahaha nailed it @Anne M. We are patiently waiting.. we need them on the streets or backroom shacks begging for bread and milk. I also doubt much can be done at the rate things are going. Given half a chance most of us would have looted too. Funny enough! Still doesnt make it right tho... "@Yin Yang If you say so hey... But i did say ""Given a chance""." I want to know Who/What is company X @Danie Nilsen So annoying.. whats the point of him telling us all this gibbberish if he wont be transparent

Makhulu Mkhulu,hi
Anne M.,"@Immanuel If he was investigating matters @Mbuso Ndlovu Apparently the Asset Forfeiture Unit is already putting together cases against some of the looters. @Lorraine Naidoo I am just as frustrated as you are. I was told that the unit has to make sure their cases are watertight so that they don't get overturned by the court. "@Mbuso Ndlovu Sadly @zintle ndzwangu Agree. Too many people are suffering because money was eaten by these corrupters.
Sam Monkoe,@Lorraine Naidoo Pls dont jinx us lol
Pastor J.J,@Yin Yang I salute you. @Lorraine Naidoo I salute you tooo
