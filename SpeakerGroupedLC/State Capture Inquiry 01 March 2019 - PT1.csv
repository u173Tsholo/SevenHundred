Suzanne,Why are they late? He is clearly NOT impressed with waiting Eskom treasurer Andre Frank Pillay is taking the stand in today's proceedings of the Zonda Commission of Inquiry. and the paperwork is ALWAYS a confused issue! Still glad its not my job to collate all these papers! @Jean-Pierre Le Roux most of these folks seem to be ex gov employees... they all seem to have their docets together... docket sigh I know! BUT what i hope is that the few of us watching this go out and tell everyone what we hear and see here. in that way we are vital to become part of the big picture and we wont be fooled again! @Sofia Sofia i commented at the top somewhere - you can find it there.

Makho Theo,Head2Head Becafull Praise can be blinding to reality That’s right JSE Boss Why don’t they devise Eskom to 3 part series of... Industrial. Commercial. Residential Production Distribution and Finances They just wan to make tree CEOs Inadequate Response lack of Rapport must be the Land Claims #DD lols all the way Mr Nyanda was clueless yesterday Chair!!!!! No Analysis ANC is too evil to turn a blind Eye 👁 @Felix not helpful. True this is it Reactive Proper Ganda Madiba where art thou? 💭 Eskom has had upgrades all the way infrastructure. The coal is an Outsourcing issue So load shedding is a Management not Technical concern. Planning/ plant management @Joel currently it’s only a financial issue Ask any Eskom field worker I think it’s time to bit this chat to stick to the State inquiry Lol 😆 Eastern Heritage Tea ☕️
M T,#Sofia - Yeah ... he appears honest - That’s attractive 😬 "Hi all - Joined later - Who is this STD manipulated the Souf Efrican “Ront” 👹 He meant ZAR "I’d like to know when Squirrel signed EksDom over to China? They wouldn’t make it public knowledge re IPP’s "#Harland I concur - what pees on my battery "When did Squirrel conclude the EksDom Deal awarded to China? They didn’t want to reveal or make public Two-legged Carrion 👹 #John James 😝 Our funds have also expired 👿 #Frik / The whole damned lot + 🎯 SAA next! In simple terms - Africa 👿 #Rohan 🤗 Welcome back They will bring their laws with them - I guess over-population will be countered 😉 Saves taxpayers feeding the crooks 🤣 "#Sthakathi - Yeah #Ryan 2kboss 🤷‍♀️ "Without all the looting - We would have been OK #Derek Main. 🎯 "DRC is already Chinese - sorry Ryan "#Ryan - and SA supposedly belonged to those who live in it? Hmmm? Go figure! Like pushing a shopping trolly Frik. # No space followed by name 🤗 #John-Basel Ioannou - Thanks - sad Story. It worked Frik 👏🏻 It’s working Frik! Your response IS highlighted! 👏🏻 "Tell us about the coal which was sent in container loads to China #Thando 👍🏻👏🏻 I’ll be back shortly - Much like Arnold 🤗
makhosi nobhatyi,"2014 and 15 things was getting out of control Guptas was fully control executive and president Prosecutor is very cool and calmed "Mr Nyanda was clear know what went wrong but he didn’t say much Our leadership was just protecting individuals not a party and nursing’s Zuma faction that says there will no special congress will sit b4 election conference Yes Ramaphosa even I want her to be deputy now "Thuli Nkutha is brilliant she can but faction is killing us
Mzalwane Mzala,There are no prosecutors in a commission of inquiry. Advocate Norman is leading the evidence of this witness.
Moosa Ndwandwe,thando nkuna we are confused about the lost years

Asheesh o bua masepa sebono moeia @Eslon Eslon he is Andre Pillay Eskom Treasurer @Makho Theo loadshedding is both technical and managerial It's about how the Generation executives allocate incentives to plant managers @Makho Theo bean counters cannot tackle loadshedding. They must avail money for maintenance but the Engineers/Managers need to call the shots

Eslon Eslon,who's the witness? Thanks Joel "@JS Bach "@JS Bach Guys have realize that ndz faction of the ANC are invisible and reluctant to help CR 17 to unite and renew the party. instead they are in courts fighting their own movement "@Takalani
Glenn Llewellyn,Yeesssss.
Carl Theunissen,@Thando Nkutha Somebody has to lay a complaint to the Public Protector before she can investigate. Some journalists were starting to ask questions but nobody complained. @Thando Nkutha Why do you say Maties is racist? Do you study there? @Thando Nkutha please provide all the facts. @Eslon Eslon somebody still has to make a complaint. @Thando Nkutha I can't believe it. How do you know she was refused based on the colour of her skin? "@Thando Nkutha my son had 8 distinctions and an aggregate of 93%. He couldn't get a bursary. He is white. So it seems we are all stuffed. Also "@Thando Nkutha no bursary from anyplace

Lance Fourie,Man these prosecutors can only watch the time
Harland Leyds,This guy seems clued up with the finances of Eskom and the concerns about certain deals which raised red flags. Looks very competent in his position at Eskom.
Opo Opo,"They must hurry lol spelling cold* Don't forget check it out Ramaphosa and ILO's Zuptas 😱 poor white elephants. "They also selling coal to the third part
Takalani Malotsha,Elson they are fighting back
Lorna Kavanagh,There is no doubt that this whole story about state capture and its criminals should be charged with Treason. They have dragged SA .... into a state of strangulating debt! So the people suffer for it.
Doom Ruler,aaaah nah ... this guy gave incorrect figures
Frik Brits,I heard they want to put up tarrifs as well?? "@Sthakathi Khumalo  forgive my ignorance but where is SALONGA PARK ?? "I see @ Ryan 2kboss  🤣🤣🤣🤣 "@Magda Seguin  "@Ryan 2kboss  "@Sthakathi Khumalo  "#Moira T  "#Moira T  Yaaaaa its quiet. Fils not here??

Sharlene Van Oudtshoorn,lll
Derek Main,@Sthakathi Khumalo The ANC have shown that they will not change - the corruption runs too deep. We'd only have to hang one or two corrupt officials for that to change. @Sthakathi Khumalo I hear you - no political party is covering themselves in glory. They are all looking after themselves and spitting in the eyes of us citizens who pay their fat salaries.
Myka'Al Daud,Treasurer of SOE? Eskom "No accountability "Taxpayers will pay
Mahendra Dabideen,"Sthakathi Khumalo
