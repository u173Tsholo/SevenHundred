Ayanda she cannot recall about the letter. If you are a real man you have to trust your koko IHe has a black wife and she cannot take his koko anymore South Africa media are weak .How possible all media houses could miss all the mess . Eskom is inthe pocket of Ramaphosa and family as Bosasa in the pocket of Zuma and family and Bidvest in the pocket Helen Zille EFF is the party to vote before Karima Brown destroy it The only problem with JZ is to work with Indians if he worked with Afrikaaners he would be a hero YEBO Adv Maleka tea please If Maleka was a car he could be Toyota corola briliants I hope this one will not be another Afrikaaner He looks white not like afrikaaner @Moira T Ayi wena afrikaaners are not white.Orania people are not white.

"Anything that bind him then we get an answer that says ""I can not recall """ @thando cezula 😂😂😂😂😂 squeeze him until his dry!! This guy is a liar. How come Agrizzi could remember everything that happen 10yrs back at his age and this guy can not recall something happened 4yrs back at his age. @Felix Muyoba. This man must just come clean and tell the truth. otherwise he must face the consequences. How on earth can someone prepare a letter for you and you just sign and not read to see if its correct or not. Now you come here you can't recall anything. The question is very clear Is he crying now This is just crocodile tears. They must just squeeze him more. @Norman Zwane. You mean his acting now?😂😂😂 his at the movie? @Norman Zwane 😂😂😂😂. His not used of cameras and lights Can you hear they busy laughing at this guy comedy @Yin Yang.The truth shall set him free @Norman Zwane 😂😂😂😂😂 @Norman Zwane 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I can not believe this really. waving to ppl you dont know... come on bra you killing me ppl keep on asking me what am i laughing.

Was this guy captured as well? @Eslon Eslon. I can't recall his name but he was here before. his from Standard bank. @Felix Muyoba. maybe others will try and help us. "@Thando Nkutha. I've got an account with std I think i must go withdraw all my funds @Thando Nkutha. I would do so because this one is going down like VBS
welton paulse,morning leadership This guy sounds like he is not too interested in his own testimony Joshua Doore Arrests and suspensions of parliamentarians should by now have been made
Ntombethemba Manase,I have been away for a week. Is the witness a thief or not? I only want to watch the thieves not the priests.😊😊 Thankyou😄😄let me then bring my popcorns. Dali Mpofu is very weak when it comes to cross examination. "Me too Cyril Is the PAC president not Mzwanele Nyotso? OK Mzalwana.
Norman Zwane,@Ntombethemba Manase By your scale the woitness could be a Cardinal "@Ntombethemba Manase Anyhow yisishimane The 'koek' won lesishimane left Eskom! @Musa Bakiti The puppet master's were Indian actually. The blacks were stage managers and the puppets were Afrikaner. Slightly more complicated than Mampintsha and Babes wodumo. @Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly Try the 'frowning' lady facing us seated below the judge. Maybe you'll even make her smile. "'honestly?""" "@Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly You scared of her? I am "@Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly Try screaming at your screen.

Let him come and testify first "@Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly Your target is on the screen "@Felix Muyoba No comment @Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly I 'honestly' thought it would work. Just watch her and eat your heart out knowing what you are missing. @Felix Muyoba Very proverbial sir. No chance of me ever being Lekau literal. "@Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly You love dark chocolate "@makhosi nobhatyi Well Dali is Mr Popular @Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly We on the same whatapp group there. I even married one I;m so crazy about them. @thando cezula Scratch the surface and there are zillions of them trolling us on hind sight you lied sir! @Desmond Masilela He is a poor actor Zondo cut too close to the bone and the crook cracked. @Desmond Masilela I think it is the effects of the cameras and lights Des. @Magda Seguin I don't like the word 'vitriolic'. @Desmond Masilela Ya it is. I once started waving at people I did not know at the airport when the caneras and lights started flashing. I only realised later that Nkosazana zuma was behind me. Yini yona i #Yin yang? @Musa Bakiti I think the wife denies him some 'koko' too. @Desmond Masilela To a novice like me that is what Cameras and lights do. "@Kapn Krunch I know you wanted to say it. Spit it out: ""and a big mouse too""" @Magda Seguin You try and see how many appeals he will lodge. "@Eslon Eslon Judge Zondo upset him @Eslon Eslon His mom did send a note that he is sensitive I am? "@Derek Main with a nose that huge @Magda Seguin Fecetious. Not funny I concede. "@Derek Main He was born that way @Derek Main Him who was there when Zuma messed up. @Derek Main Ramatlhodi gave us some insight how Zuma went about his business. From what I gleaned one would have needed real balls to wreck the Zuma train. I do not however condone the silence pact. "@Derek Main I think the TOP 6 were weaklings @Derek Main Those who seek public office must have sterner stuff and be ready to bat against an onslaught. There can be no excuse for these guys. They became crooks and need be judged as such. @Derek Main Shamefully I must confess to have voted ANC in the past. Never again!!! These guys took us backward whilst claiming to be delivering progress. "@Eslon Eslon I must have missed that. Never thought Zuma was ever opposed hence his exit line:""What have I done?""" "@Mzalwane Mzala I thought that was quite bold at the time @Eslon Eslon I am certainly not denying it. I'm just upset it resulted into nothing. @Mzalwane Mzala I was saying as much to @Derek Main. I just found the weak lambs who easily toed the line disgusting. It is them that made me feel that the ANC is beyond redemption. They still there. "@Eslon Eslon That I agree with @Funani Manzi No I do not know "@Sthakathi Khumalo Mbulaz' omnyama @Funani Manzi Zuma resisted Ramaphosa ok? What am I to benefit from knowing how crudely he did? "@Eslon Eslon You put me on the spot now "@Funani Manzi Before I waste your time let me own up @Sthakathi Khumalo Mtungwa nami ngizo beka indlebe la ebandla. impilo yona isekhona. Okungu Koko lokhu kucabanga ukuthi kukhona impunga yehlathi. Kungekudala kuzovela obala kubhushuzela kunqunu @Eslon Eslon Actually for not willing to throw his political career makes him subject to compromise for me. i rather like the sort of life of committing only to things you can just walk away from. @Chris Bard I read an opinion that suggested that a Corruption TRC may serve us better than trying people in courts. Do you buy into that option? "@Derek Main That 'collective' nonsense is the same as 'its an allegatior ""I have appealed the ruling""on""" @Musa Bakiti The 'uncle' in the furniture business @Funani Manzi Say that again? @Derek Main I'm going to wake up and replace my 'crap detector' so that I never ever miss rubbish like that again.

Felix Muyoba,@Ntombethemba Manase hahaha you! i agree with @Ntombethemba Manase thieves are cool to watch.. true @Desmond Masilela look at how everybody wants agrizzi to be back on the stand.. i wonder why this guy decided to testify on this commission but he doesnt recall things most of the time..what is his problem?\ "@Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly tsek @thando cezula then you are right with your squeezing dry @Norman Zwane haha..nice one! @Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly maybe you dont know how to approach ladies.. @Desmond Masilela i agree with you..maybe he was threatened @makhosi nobhatyi when will be that? i cant wait also.. @Norman Zwane he is not a sniper..he will miss ok @makhosi nobhatyi @Norman Zwane just a proverbial statement and not literally involving a gun I wonder where @Yin Yang is because yesterday he was worshiping this guy like nobody s business he cant even wait for the chair to stand first he looks to be frustrated @Yin Yang well educated but a THIEF crying again @Norman Zwane hahaha no man! i dont think he is answering the question.. this guy is just story telling.. @Desmond Masilela very much so "eish the witness @Musa Bakiti looks like he is @Desmond Masilela then we are on the same page..no comment @Bumbano Enzelwe i agree..we are just hearing who stole what..thats all.. @Derek Main i for one dont believe in that..some anc members will tell you that you are on your own.. @Eslon Eslon @Desmond Masilela am also in the dark about this guy @Jane .Blamire thank you "@Thando Nkutha but standard bank closed the accounts of the guptas as soon as they realised their dealings..so @Eslon Eslon yes I did @Tobo Lwandile treasury was supposed to be the one involved not the minister @LoneSouthAfricanBear in your dreams!! @Cassius Mngomezulu how?

The small guys matter in building the puzzle Cry me a river! Come clean! Reveal all! 9 wasted years... The ANC kept Zuma as president after he was found by the Concourt to have violated his Oath Of Office. The ANC at that point was truly broken!

Facts please @thando cezula Ok you are speculating...I understand your bias Wait till the real crooks come to testify...I wonder what you guys will say then...The Guptas are in hiding and you are blaming minions You guys are bloodthirsty...The Bosasa captured ANC thieves are comfortable but you are less vitriolic to them Men are human too...stop being misogynistic and sexist Ia "You don't know me @Norman Deane get a dictionary *Zwane He is not divorced @than do cezula I watch so ce the beginning.. Don't insult my I intelligence Some people focus on minor people who were manipulated while the thieves and Guptoids are free a d Sri are all Many don't understand what went down and the psychosis of state capture #Yin Yang.. What is a 'strong' man?...an abuser? When all the lights go out as is happening in Venezuela you guys will understand the full impact of what Zuma did to SA Everyday Eskom reports that 'there may be load shedding' I think Me Hofmeyer is acting like a prosecutor...she went so far as to insinuate guilt Why is Zuma not subpoenaed? "Some men on this thread are rude @M @Norman Deane my question was rhetorical @Neil Fraser True "This man is not at Eskom anymore @Norman. You are being facetious Yes it's obvious @Norman Zwane not funny at all..This is a serious matter Zuma is a psychotic narcissicist...he doesn't care about people's lives I am blocking @Norman Zwane he is totally I appropriate...go play elsewhere @Derek Main exactly...who is he after all? I see that nobody here are shocked that people died on Gupta mines @makhosi South Africans have short memories...You are right Brian Molefe has a LOT to account for...he was totally captured Winter is coming and Eskom is struggling to keep the lights on...At Nkandla they probably have generators Nowhere in the world has liberation organisations assured proper government...They are in it for their own interests...their motto is 'it's our time to eat' All SOE's in SA was destroyed by Zuma @Derek Main...he said so right at the beginning of his testimony...he said it three times Apologies @Derek Main The Guptas have SA nationality...They are hiding in Dubai as the Indian authorities are also investigating them @Thami Zungu you are right my brother Generalisations are not in order I think Ramaphosa is waiting till after the election What happened at VBS? Actually nothing like what he is explaining. Bank of Baroda is another story of Gupta shenanigens Lifestyle audits right there! Grand theft SA brought to you by Zuma and the Guptas Taxpayers money...

Tshepo Maja,his crying yoh waste of time
Sipho,Aoch 5min.. to cry African National Corruption (ANC) In a collective responsibility everyone has his/her role to answer All the ANC NEC members under Zuma's leadership must be held accountable for this state capture
Tich Ziny,have I missed anything exciting? just in time for a comedy show
Wallace Mandimutsira,did not know that men can also weep like little babies 5 years of getting bribes and stealing lenja SOUTH AFRICA IS A COUNTRY OF COMMISSION OF ENQUIRIES so he still has so more hours to shed those croc tears but why would people still vote such a party with corrupt individuals canada do nail who/ those sealed documents have explosive info
Robert Russell,I think that he took all the pressures of his ESKOM job home and his wife could not deal with it and divorced him that is why he is emotional... he is not a crook in any way

Kapn Krunch,the small guys are the only ones who will be prosecuted the big boys walk away with their millions Zuma and his whole cabinet rhamaphosa deserves all hes getting he sat quiet as a mouse when all this was transpiring the ANC elected Zuma as president after a rape case that for me is nuff said rhamaphosa gave Zuma a job after all the corruption not exactly the right path if africa had justice Zuma would be in prison his family and friends would be stripped of their wealth because leaders get away with these things the next leaders arent even scared even Mugabe still is walking around with his millions untouched who wins the people or the leaders who are still rich Cyril rhamaphosa was given his billions by trevor Manuel 🤣🤣🤣 he couldn't even make billions himself he is the result of an African enrichment program anc officials have openly stated we did not struggle to be poor watch a video on YouTube called tainted heroes and see the truth
Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi You don't have knowledge of that either - you're just guessing what Ramaphosa said at meeting. It suits your agenda to think that - where is the proof? @makhosi nobhatyi The entire country knew long ago what Zuma was up to because it was widely reported in the media especially with regard to the Guptas. The only people who didn't want to see it were the ANC including their leaders (Ramaphosa as well). "@Norman Zwane As I said @Norman Zwane Who is he? "@Norman Zwane In fact And the rest they say is history - all that was predicted of Zuma came to pass. Only the ANC fools couldn't see it. The ANC has a lot to answer for. @Eslon Eslon The entire ANC is responsible for this mess - why should we vote for them? What happened to collective responsibility? @Mzalwane Mzala So the majority of the ANC were happy with Zuma's behaviour. @Mzalwane Mzala That's one million fools too many. @Norman Zwane Yes - we know the ANC doesn't have balls. They were too happy feeding at the trough to rock the boat. @Eslon Eslon Where was Cyril for the last 7 years? @Mzalwane Mzala I will definitely take on any ANC apologists who try to sugar-coat the destruction the ANC has caused SA. Try to defend it if you can. "@Mzalwane Mzala I'm not superstitious. Where have I insulted you? If the cap fits "@Eslon Eslon He could have spoken out and made it clear that he was against what was happening. Since he didn't @Magda Seguin I was talking about Ramaphosa @Magda Seguin no problem @Norman Zwane Agree with you there @Eslon Eslon You mean the WMC media? No - I don't recall that. @Norman Zwane Same here and never again. @Afr24News Channel Maybe it's time the EFF started looking inward. @makhosi nobhatyi We've waited for too long for the ANC to do the right thing - no more. @makhosi nobhatyi So you're happy to go along with more promises from the ANC. They only promise but don't deliver. Not falling for that again. @makhosi nobhatyi The only reason Ramaphosa is doing something now is that he realises the ANC is in serious trouble. It's a matter of survival not a moral fortitude. @Funani Manzi Do you believe in the concept of collective responsibility? @Funani Manzi So why do you not think Cyril should not be held collectively responsible for Zuma's destruction of SA? "@Felix Muyoba So when it suits the ANC "@Sipho At the TRC hearings @Sipho I think all ANC voters should be held responsible for subjecting SA to Zuma's criminality. "@Norman Zwane Or ""we can't suspend implicated persons that have not been found guilty by a court of law""." @Funani Manzi Why did all ANC MPs protect Zuma time and again in parliament? @Norman Zwane Yep - we've been burnt once too many times - we can't allow it to happen again. @Funani Manzi Not a chance - I'm too honest to be one. @Eslon Eslon What about parliament? They protected Zuma from any sanction. "@Funani Manzi According to the vote counts @Eslon Eslon The ANC can try to spin it any way they want to - we SAfns are not as stupid as the ANC thinks we are. Now we must make them pay for thinking that. @Matodzi Netsianda Only if you are happy with self-enriching criminals running our government. "@Mzalwane Mzala ""They liberated us"" - that's a tired old excuse." Who was there when the plunder was happening and said nothing. @Eslon Eslon Not so fast - the rot runs deep. "@Funani Manzi Yes I am - if they did not disclose corruption

Mzalwane Mzala,ANC NEC members moved a vote of no confidence on Zuma twice. It was defeated by his acolytes. The ANC at some point had around one million members. @Derek Main You never again insult me as that might haunt you. @makhosi nobhatyi I am with you @Norman Zwane Two votes of no confidence were moved in the ANC NEC EXCLUSIVE: Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson paid a R5m 'bonus' amid job losses @Norman Zwane Ngoako explained that his acolytes were many in the NEC. People were ordered back from Mzwandile Masina's wedding in Cape Town to come and bolster his defence "Two weeks before (AGO) - formerly known as Bosasa - was placed under liquidation @Norman Zwane They are now in a weaer position and a number of them have turned their backs on that regime. They are in a weaker position @Norman Zwane They are no longer in the majority Ramaphosa is leading the renewal It is risky for some people to keep on asking why others did nothing to stop something in the PAST. That question can be asked of them in some crimes against humanity. "@Funani Manzi Don't bother with Derek Main 11 Million South Africans who voted for it I should say 11 Million South African voters I am glad that you realize that @Norman Zwane For those who are still looking for political party to vote for remember that Narius Moloto will be on the ballot paper for the PAC @Ntombethemba Manase They made a deal in court for Nyhontso to act as deputy for six months. As I am not a born free my vote is for the liberation Movement. 1. ANC and if it ever change it could be AZAPO etc @Matodzi Netsianda Matamela is already working to fix the country.
