Loretta Jacobus,5 minutes late DCJ ended 5 minutes ago
makhosi nobhatyi,Late again Ngubani will be in trouble "Those thousands of people who are working for clicks must not vote for eff "So what? What must we do then ? I don‚Äôt understand why you fight these companies coz they employed people "Zuma and his faction once CR17 President Ramaphosa should know everything what was going on They demolished shelves @ Mogau Mphahlele
katji maghumbo,"It's like the Nuremberg trial
Hlagala Masetlale,eeheeh mmh mmh when are they going to start. he was suspended as part of the state capture project @kamogelo it's costing us peanuts compared to what the guptas have looted you're right #salome seabi this guy was just an honest hard working person what about if the npa enlists the service of the FBI? lol was he also in this murky business? ngubane must be charged with that guy who doesn't remember when did he get married. "ngubane is the granddaddy of state capture @carmen yaa started very slowly when is Lynn brown going to appear?i hope she is going to remember everything. Cuban doctors might be getting UIF he was given benefits for doing nothing
N.G.,Hi who‚Äôs in the chair? what is he suspected of doing?
Frank Jordaan,N.G. he was CEO at Escom when he was suspended without any explanation and replaced with Molefe. He was suspended following instructions from Zuma and Myeni to the board. "Quest exactly. That is when 3 executives where suspended and Singh Salome so true. We lost great people with high integrity who was discarded because they were not prepared to sell their souls to the corrupt hyenas. Ms Klein just another little Zupta puppet. Koko was the only suspended executive who retained his job. It is now clear why. Zakes you are right. Salome you are right. The NPA was completely destroyed by the likes of Jiba and The Sheep. Mhakosi let us hope so Hlagala apperently he was in a business relationship with a Gupta associate. Ngubani was the same one who defended Cloudy Hlaudi and gave him a massive increase. "Hlagala remember how she fumbled Salome agree 110% "Eddie the meeting in Durban with Zuma was attended by then Escom chairman "This witness is like a breath of fresh air. Open Carmen so right. Salome he should be given a chance
Lonwabo Mahlulo,üëÄ "chats are disturbing maybe tomorrow will be entertaining than this second partüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so he might not work for government or I. South Africa after this? Mr President can really help him with a jobüòÅ has üëÄevery whereüòÅ
Dominic Przybylski,Only 2 South African Companies have a higher turnover than ESKOM - Anglo American and Sasol. So this man should be around the 3rd most qualified/succesful businessman in the country. If he wasn't then why was he in that position? @Kamogelo Maphunye a small fraction on what is going to be spent on giving free laptops to university students. "It seems this is all just noise... Why isn't SARS going after people who get Do we actually have a government assuming a government provides economic infrastructure and rule of law? Even if NPA eventually charges somebody it will be years before they actually get a court date. Still waiting for JZ to appear in court 15+ years later and still counting. Shamila Batohi does not seem to be doing any better than her predecessor. As long as we vote on the basis of race we remain captured by apartheid. Wow! Must be nice to have such an easy life that one has the time to be enraged by a Clicks advert. Obsession with race stinks. "@Salome Seabi The people suffering at Clicks are the people being threatened by EFF Free market allows you to buy from a competitor if you don't like Clicks. @Mogau Mphahlele Just don't buy from them if you don't like them. That's how it is done in a civilized society. Of course it may take us many years to achieve that level. @Mogau Mphahlele burning and looting is not considered civilized in the rest of the world. @Mogau Mphahlele Check again. I wonder who wrote JZ's open letter to CR?
Thubelihle Bhunu,ANC yey all these media and newspapers are own by white in the country of story
Quest,scapegoat Huzet chair? @Jongi Cayalli umuncu sani
Carmen James,They understood perfectly. Unfortunately the witness did not serve the Gupta Agenda which was loading at the time. Yes!@Salome Seabi Miss Klein must testify Ms Klein is a cheerleader for Koko!!!!!! Ngubane a big Gupta enabler Yes @Hlagala Masetlale One thing this commission has taught me is that the main crooks are gogos and madalas...... @dennis oldude today's evidence leader is pedantic but thorough Yes @Elton Josea . He is very thorough "Hi@Lady T. We are still listening to evidence as to how the State Capture Agenda got rid of the witness as Eskom CEO to pave the way for Molefe "@Lady T and the Minister Lyn Brown. Of course all this followed a meeting between Brown Yes @Eddie Reddy . I agree Our witness is a gentleman. He definitely wasn't suitable for the State Capture Agenda. @Deanos Rides Only special people can do this job...LOL @Salome Seabi . Its a Black man...a certain Mr Mabena @Salome Seabi These matters are regulated by labour law. @Salome Seabi That may be true. But we can't make our own laws no matter how aggrieved we may be. @Salome Seabi This is not about the EFF... Exactly. I agree @Jabu Malinga Exactly @Salome Seabi . Nation building not mud slinging @Thabo Ngwenya There are processes to be followed. @Thabo Ngwenya . I am not making excuses. Merely stating a fact....Settlements come as the result of a PROCESS. "@Thabo Ngwenya . Be that as it may Our evidence leader is on point. This gentleman has been the best witness in weeks. He obviously doesn't have anything to hide. @Thomas Cleghorn I think that they dirtied themselves. He is just exposing what happened. @Mathapelo Mokadi You do? I am very impressed with his testimony after listening to the lies of Mama Action and Vincent Smith last week..... @Mokgadi Banda They wanted to appoint their chief enablers What a gentleman!!!!!!! He has every right to be very angry but he is so calm and level-headed. Judge Zondo pointing out the trend of people who are not guilty of misconduct being 'pushed out' by Government. Here's it guys........the MEETING WITH ZUMA!!!! @Dominic Przybylski Maybe Uncle Carl...... Huh?????? Spaghettii???? Not curry???? Which university @Canaverde2 Evidence leader on point!!!!!!!!!!! @Thabiso Mahloko This man can teach our politicians a thing or two about integrity @Innaman Joubert Which crony? @Elton Josea So glad that you stuck with this @Jabu Malinga What happened to the farm? @Salome Seabi Our 'eaders' love living beyond their means......Love izinto za Colonialism Hehehe @Frank Jordaan . He was very kind towards the 'shebeen frequenter'. Said that he did have the expertise. Pity that he had not ethics and integrity hehehe@Ncise Philasande . Not only does he look like him......He also sounds like him! LOL!!!! Mr Tsotsi.....could be implicated......Eish you can't make this up....That name!!!!! Judge Zondo has the patience of a saint. This Commission is too much now!!! @Mathapelo Mokadi . University in Wales. South
Kamogelo Maphunye,kana how much is this commission costing us?
Mmone Benjamin,"Aow Kamo papa
Michael Roebuck,"if you lie enough you convince yourself it's true. I don't think people can believe what they are seeing at Zondo 
jw Perold,Why spent so much time on this? We know he was unjustly treated. the Commission must interrogate the real wrongdoers at Eskom and get the criminals involved in State Capture in jail. That is what the public wants to see. This Commission is costing the public millions and millions and we are not yet seeing justice being done
Salome Seabi,anc always push out all honest people so that its hyena may feed comfortably on our money "If the NPA can get the best senior counsels in SA to deal with all crooks of state capture "thats the question Special courts must be established to deal specifically with state capture hyenas yes Ngubane is have dirrheah becos of this witness Oliver Thambo is turning in his grave due to the current ANC cadres Ramaphosa must act on the recommendations of this commision as a matter of MUST PLZ in next elections NO 1 must vote ANC Voting anc will be treasonous crime yes my br @Mokadi yes We must all spread the word that no 1 must vote anc we must canvas agaist anc to save SA FOR OUR CHILDREN NO 1 must wear Ramaphosa T shirt during next elections the ppl are more powerful than anc crooks. dont be afraid of them ok misunderstand oh jaaaaaaa Racism IS PAINFUL TO THE CORE AND UNACCEPTABLE NOW AND FOREVER RACISM INDID SMELL 2 MUCH NO EXCUSE IS ACCEPTABLE ON RACISM IF I IS NOT AFFECTED BY RACISM CANT BE OSSESED BY IT CLICKS MUST B TAUGHT A LESSON YES AT LEAST LOSING PROFIT WILL RETURN SOME SANITY NO IVIDENCEV IS REQUIRED IT IS CLEAR AS ABC I BETTER STARV RATHER THAN BEING UNDERMINED BY ANOTHER HUMAN BEING THE CULPRIT AT CLICKS MUST BE FIRED MUST B FIRED UNACCEPTABLE THE LAW IS SLOW SOMETIMES EFF EFFORTS MUST NOT B INVALIDATED GUYS WE MUST ALL CONTRIBUTE TO NATION BUILDING IRRESPECTIVE OF OUR COLOUR I HATE RACISM AND APARTEID TO THE CORE BOTH MAKE ME VOMIT is the current eskom CEO ANC member? becos ANC has this tendency of deployement yeb "JZ will curse the day he was born zuma must ask his ancestors to take him to them ASAP "Thabo Mbeki knew something about JZ which most ppl didnt know. Why is NPA not prosecuting zuma for his state capture sins based on all of the prema facie evidence agaist him Zuma instructed the board to get rid of him becos he was commanded by the guptas to do so @Thabiso a big yes @jabu u r right i remember vividly repossesd malema is still anc wearing red but he speaks the truth @malinga 4 president viva malinga u r right viv malinga malinga u must speak more on julius. ur truth is vital i know that. but most ppl need to b reminded of that becos indid he is a crook mayby mashaba can save SA YES U R RIGHT YEB

Siphiwe Mthiyane,@Mathys Botha being 90% black doesn't mean that the advert was not racist. The people who approved the advert were racist. Clicks promoted that racist act by playing it in public. Evil prevails when us the innocent remain silent. Being employed by someone doesn't mean they can insult you and you should be happy about it
