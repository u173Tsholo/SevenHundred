Elvis Malakoane,pastor j very Goodmorning to you and blessed day further sir who is our guest today? pastor j Do we have any idea if this implicated mass looters will be arrested in our life time pastor j OK pastor I trust that will bring the nation to some peace of mind cos it has been long now true pastor j Richard Mahope I think scale of state capture corruption was unprecedented and hopefully will not happen again chairman is pisst off very true Richard because state collapsed and 58million people suffer because of maybe about 100 individuals she has legal degree Rubin Naidoo that group of people declared government as their THING like alcapone mafia Cosa nostra (it's our thing) Norman Zwane true name and shame
Thapelo Motabogi,"sound is available guys
Immanuel,morning highly esteemed @Pastor Jüôè "what are her qualifications as head of legal
Nozipho Shazi,what the agenda
Richard Mahope,is the world ending will there be ending with these shinanigans I will be happy if that can happen cause we the suffering are bleeding when we listen to these shinanigans look at what is happening in our country no jobs plus the pandemic that needs a lot money that is in few people's pocket. Not waiting their chance but busy as we chat True as the law stated who were the owners of the companies wil he be ever jailed I think he is still a cancer where he is was these lady undermined
adrian albertyn,lock down why cant the camera go to the advocate

Ricus Ellis,"As long as the ANC is the governing party It all depends on the Public Protector and the hawks to take these matters to court
Norman Zwane,"It is this culture of ""not naming names"" that got us here in the first place." @Inam I guess we have other pressing priorities now. I share your sentiment. If Zuma is forced to come testify he will suffer from Corona and will go to Wuhan for treatment. "@Ricus Ellis I agree. If any have not yet stolen
Inam _,Close this thing. We are busy with COVID-19 now.

Mzalwane Mzala,"Is this gathering in compliance with the regulations? If not Th count start with me . 1 "@Pheladi Lamola Do not listen to @Pastor J . LIFO is not relevant here. I am number 1. Pheladi is number 2 @Richard Mahope has declared himself so he is 4. Lucky ran this SOE like his own spaza shop. I am also curious about that. He threatened to come and reveal things but later changed his mind and said he is not coming because the commission wants to temper with his evidence. For a couple of months he tweeted about being busy preparing a statement and he said that will expose many people. It was disappointing when he said he is no longer pursuing that. The commission must just issue summons to him. He is no longer working for government Soni must sit down and rest A magistrate was suspended based on the evidence presented in this commission. Consequence. Block Lucky once suspended an Executive after he told him to be in a meeting now and the person was in another province. He was the law at Prassa
Pheladi Lamola,@Mzalwane Mzala ü§£ü§£ü§£ how do we determine who leaves?
