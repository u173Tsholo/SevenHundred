Mike Newlands,Oh snd greetings to the thieves & liars at Lootfreely House & Ex Pres. Zuma PS Who was the comrade that brought 4 Porsches with his share of the R600m you stole? The poor want to know. @Granny Mokwena sadly thats not going to happen-the Zondo Commission will be shut down soon & never return. The ANC are working to ensure that. @khulekani bonelani Yes I agree sadly out incompetant useless corrupt police/Hawks/SIU/SAPS have done nothing! Why?Paid off with a back hander by Steinhoff? But my guess just to incompetant !! @khulekani bonelani Well as I say if he did where is the SAPS/Hawks -all to busy taking bribes. Remember over 50%of police are corrupt. "@Shadrack Moalusi Well who will get the msge?Cele doesnt care when SAPS murder a 6 year old @moiseng mashego agreed seems like a decent honest man. Pity he is black listed from working in the ANC corrupt gov. He should apply to the DA they might employ him. @Ralph Muthusami are u suggesting we just let the ANC loot until the country is completely broke. If they are stealing at least we should know how much! @Katso Paulinah exactly the president can hardly fire anybody for corruption when he & his fellow thieves are all corrupt! @Ntsapho Njisane what exactly is white privilege? So R600m stolen by ANC & Lootfreely house spent mostly on imported fancy cars creating employment for europeans in Europe & none for us.#voetsekANC Cuban who said Cuban? No ways we had the Cubans involved? Wow this is news we cant emply or train South Africans we use Cubans what bull crao is this. Lootfreely house u are watching-say something u cowards @Benjamin Tebza I suspect its to late-it seems we are now run from Cuba via Lootfreely House🤬😠 @Benjamin Tebza I didnt 😄 How did highlight mine?

L Ll,Very relevant question I was thinking about it too "I am sorry and thank you So if you know you did just take responsibility and apologise that’s all This Zondo person is making a lot of money right now through the inquiry lol Well nobody is a saint but some are worse than the rest of us lol Moiseng agreed 👍 Unless they bury the loot in their backyards 🤣🤣🤣 Phakamile apartheid was the worst because they solved all corruption in private and it was just a few of them sharing the loot They don’t have a choice because voters will kick them out Chinese people still respect the laws too Mbuso especially for those monsters killing women everywhere in SA Mbuso absolutely 👍 There are always arguments for and against but in some cases death penalty is appropriate Jacqui most countries are lenient too eg England and Australia life has a min and max sentence Australia is just too lenient compared to the rest of the world abc the same applies to people who want the death penalty abolished lol it just depends on your opinion lol It doesn’t mean it won’t be reinstated along the way though
