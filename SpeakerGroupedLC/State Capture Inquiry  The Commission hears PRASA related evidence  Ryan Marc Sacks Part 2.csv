Tseki Mosia,🤣🤣🤣 @Black.. you mean
dolly dolly dolly,THE GUPTAS ARE WATCHING THIS IN THEIR ROOMS IN DUBAI WITHOUT DOUBT
Dominic Przybylski,No qualifications other than skin colour required for BEE contracts. R82 million recently paid for 'NHI communications' to someone who only delivered a few photos of the minister of health on facebook and twitter to earn that money. """for lack of a better word... theft' the official government word[s] for it is ""expropriation without compensation""." Heh the police are in their own mess. Does anyone know of an honest deal between SOE's and their 'suppliers' which actually delivered value for the money? A 5m kitchen looks like a normal kitchen and the change is used to buy an Aston Martin and trip to Dubai. Hawks and NPA have nothing to show and even if charges are laid our courts are so slow most witnesses die of old age before the hearing... and then of course there are endless options for appeal. Our judicial system just doesn't work against anyone who can afford a lawyer.
wendy hardy,BBEEE has crucified South Africa !!!

Another cadre trying to avoid cupbability Chair is calling for ethical & honest intitiative from the comrades which will never happen! @MIKE DURBAN - oh yes! Very astute at shifting the blame & stealing the money.  I may not remember!! Isn't it so convenient that she doesn't recall the meeting! Answer the question woman! She is ducking & diving like all her comrades have done. How convenient that it was Jackson Mthembu who she spoke to 🙂 yeah right Earning millions but she won't be there. Typical "@Christy - exactly!
