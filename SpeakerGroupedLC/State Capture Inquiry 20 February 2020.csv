Gareth Hellyar,Morning all. Late start again. Sound delay again aswell. Judge will only make his findings at end of commission hearings. By that time all the culprits have left the country. We all know that State Capture happened. Blank!? Whats happening? My screen is blank. Anyone else? Back. Maybe trying to sort sound out. Bad picture. A lot zamma zammas going on. "Sound better Looks like Kate coming back. Feel sorry for the next oke. Not so much interest in commission these days. Hardly anyone there. We have to wait and see. Maybe its Zuma!! Mr Y has finished his say. Here he comes! Thats better!! But true.

France is practically African now "@Luvuyo Zantsi not much but just look at their big cities @Luvuyo Zantsi lol ...joke! "@Mzalwane Mzala but i don't think we will survive the ANC "@Mzalwane Mzala in SA yes @Mzalwane Mzala The black people have their traditional lands then and that was their homelands @Mzalwane Mzala whites were not allowed to do anything in your traditional lands SA was a country separate from your African traditional home lands..thats why blacks needed a pass to enter SA @Mzalwane Mzala im not @Mzalwane Mzala just saying what makes sense to me @Mzalwane Mzala you were born in Cape but where did you parents come from and their parents ? @Mzalwane Mzala im sorry did not mean to offend you im just saying how i understand it

BlitzKat,KATE IS KINDA HOT @Mbuso u wish 😂😂😂 when Kate calls u better pick up Zuma should be shot in the back of the neck for his atrocious crimes!!!! death penalty is the only way is deklerk corupt? did deklerk stole bilions? who he kill? did deklerk kill some abnoxius commies? oh yes there are many courts to charge people in power for the death of innocent. ofcourse there are guilty people too aspecially look at SA. ANC are wannabe commies but actually hate to share their wealth.. what kinda commies are that? even Malema doesnt share his wealth.. what kinda marxist is that? "Yes derrick "in that sense we should have punished deklerk "its not arrogant i talk about any topic i want also all this is zumas fault lets lynch zuma "yes Derrick that wat commies want "yep vadim speaks russian not swiss vadim is tired of vodka and is going to sleep now that filthy apartheid apologist @Lee Hendrix how??? petrodollar is dominant and belongs to US @anya van loggerenberg only in big cities there is segnificant number.. not on the wholescale

Phillip Cwazibe,@ Njabulo Ntombela she should be at the North Hgh Court not at ZC. ​@ Njabulo Ntombela just checked and she is there in all white. She is testifying right now.
Derrick Paul,In China corruption is low as those caught are given the death sencence and the families of those executed are charged the costs of the exection. "If you paid attention during the atrochous apartheid period so shouldnt all who killed innocent people be charged then. Or is it just a political tool you use to cause confusion? "you missing the point the TRC commision was eveded by many with the knowlagethat certain secrets would be let out of the bag. Do you own any property? If so in the constitution there is no seperation on grounds of race. So even Black people will lthey currently ownoose their land they will loose the land they currnetly own and then who ever is in control can prevent who they dont like on the day never to succeed and drive them into poverty. "If Africa is for Africans It all seems Greek to me Nobody today can tell me why If Africa is for Africans why the Koi San and Bushman not recognised as a group of their own in this beloved country? Because many of those foreign firms aided the state to be looted. @Mr Zantsi common sense vs Economic logic.... Ask those from Zimbabwe what that means. Dont force others into poverty when your perseption is based on perception and political senssolisation. @Mr Mzala where is the homeland for the Koi San and the Bushman? Or get medical care in Cuba The history of this beautiful country started long before the white colonialists arrived

Religion is a psychological condition accepted by those who do not or cannot reason for themselves...is the cause of poverty worldwide. ...@Jacapo pol...Pravil Gordon is the only person to be left standing. "...Africa's value is in mineral and human capital and cognition "...The AU is the last stand for the children ....This person is stating that Zuma and Europeans and clandestine entities are Kings in Africa not officials. "....Africa could use more hospitals or medical centers because people get sick as in other countries ...SCOPA has the facts and seems aggressive for compliance.
Raven Penny,then corruption will explode the more money in Africa the more hunger and war most of African leaders don t care about their people i also believe South Africa will survive yes i agree if we can just work together bring back competent people please to fix eskom stop bee jail all the crooks true cr is a softy AND hecan't run this country you can talk until you blue about apartheid its not apartheid that's killing S.A. now it's corruption we have to change the government please no break down stealing

Mzalwane Mzala,@Derrick Paul What did Mr Zantsi say? "South Africa survived a crime against humanity South Africa survived deliberate exclusion of over 80% of its population from economic participation. That is worse than anything that is happening now. Yintoni ingxaki yakho @Vadim Schubernel Who are the 'we' who had homelands @anya van loggerenberg? The witness is Mr Sokombela from the Auditor General office? "@anya van loggerenberg The crime against humanity I really have no time for apartheid apologists @Derrick Paul ask @anya van loggerenberg @anya van loggerenberg I am about 50 years old and was born and grew up in the Western Cape. What nonsense are you talking? @Anne M. He has been educating on the role of the AG so far. He still has to deal with SAA specifics. @anya van loggerenberg I really have no time to deal with ignorance as the 'homelands' were set up by an apartheid law not very long ago. My parents and their parents were always African @anya van loggerenberg
