Sekgololo Johannes,time for real lawyers to do the talking play time is over which Political people? "Zuma was the leading politician. He created this time for a competent lawyer to speak. @Bongumenzi Nxumalo he is competent based on his historical journey here. Thank you Pretorius SC...Sikhakhane SC approach is now torpedoed Adv Kate Hofmeyr for CJ as soon as CJ Mogoeng MOgoeng is a goner @jack mabath she has cross-examine dmany in a court of law. Move on. Very difficult indeed Pretorius SC and Trangove SC are flawless @Futhi Ndlovu JZ wants another Seriti type of a situation. "@Carmen James I am in shock myself. I cannot @Bradley Gother wonderful It is always interesting to listen to Sikhakhane SC as he makes up stories @Futhi Ndlovu a total disgrace "I said it Sikhakhane SC tried the same trick as he did in the Bosasa Matter talking about Political Science definition of state instead of the legal one @Kido Kids very insulting @Les Modibane amen Pretorius SC is very sober Sikhakhane and Mpofu SC make political statements Pretorius SC is so sober @Yolo More indeed. I wish Sikhakhane and Mpofu SC cud learn this "PRetorius SC for NDPP That point knocked Sikhakhane SC out @Rebotile Sebake i agree Pretorius SC is very clear Zuma must answer. He has failed to respond to summons even in circumstances when he made an affirmation to do so. He is just one madala trying to play a trick on all of us "@Russia He is very calm Zuma says he is not implicated? What is he smoking @Thulani Sokhela do we still have such a team here? I am sure next week Zuma will be in Cuba sick. @Rudi Haywood dead dead @Akhonamandla Gala 10000000000000000000000000000000000% right @Bhekie Sibiya get out of here with ya racist rhetorics @Louis C i wish he would.

He might be exciting for the ear "Sikhakhane SC shud ghave made a direct frontal attack on the DCJ "No Is Zuma still paying back the money? "Zuma establishes the commission of inquiry I cry "@Goat - gossip is always entertaining Just listening. shreds him Pretorius SC Zuma told us that he removed Nene so that Nene joins the BRICS regional bank; something that Nene knew nothing about nor ever happned.

Natalie Soine,Smack Dat ! Zondo must stay and not give in to the showerhead Go Mr Pretorius !
Dominic Przybylski,Wow! Restart on time. This tells me that Zondo was far too gentle on Dudu Myeni. @chimbuzi1 Most South Africans would loot if they got the chance so they see nothing wrong with ANC. @chimbuzi1 The popular philosophy (ubuntu) is based on collective responsibility i.e. No individual needs to take responsibility for his actions. "@Piet Vast They did well in the beginning with RDP houses etc. but particularly under Zuma """He has told you..."" I didn't hear him say a word." "So no decent counter argument

Hi @Naledi Barron 🤗 It is EXACTLTY what Zuma wants. For the commission to collapse. Then he gets away again. He is a skelm klein bliksem! There is no conundrum. Sit down! The only sinking for Zuma I want to see is that he sinks his feet in to an orange overall. Orange is the new Zuma "He banna DCJ is not biased! Zuma and his lawyers like to say everyone is biased! TSEK Zuma!!!!!! According to Zuma someone who is biased is someone who can't be corrupted. I need Adv. Kate AK47 Hofmeyr. It will all have been dealt with and Zuma had to answer the questions Matric Exam Math paper 2 leaked 2 hours before the examination commenced.

THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD SKHAKHANE TO READ THE COMMISSION'S DUTY @Mondli Mncibi Dude I think youre sitting on top of your keyboard @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA true. thats why he will lose this application. He wanted us to understand his cllient's perspective. Pretorius is showing us the terms and grounds of the commission @Phumza Norman But he is answering Sikhakhane' s points 1 by 1 @Yolo More 😁 @Magesh Difa Yesssss!! Who doesnt want a free concert "The State through the commission wants to hear Zuma's side of the story. If he is innocent he will walk. What is difficult there? Stop blaming racism @chimbuzi1 they vote for the same reason people stay in an abusive relationship. Humans prefer what they know. No matter how bad it is @chimbuzi1 They dont care about right and wrong. Theyre loyal to the cause no matter where it takes them

Karabo T,Maybe Mogoeng Mogoeng should have take this task... He is right...DCJ must think. COme on "I was in DCJ corner earlier Mr Pretorius is telling DCJ the truth...in principle saying DONT BE WEAK "Pretorius is saving Zondo. Embarrasing. DCJ will not be the same
JS Bach,But that is what Zuma wants. To collapse the commission! @Karabo T I've read that Judge Mogoeng has a fearsome temper. I don't think he would have been so patient as our DCJ. Ag rubbish man!!!!! "There he said it. ""Inquisatorial"". Zuma "Zuma @Khanyi Age.gracefully you speak true words. The lizard is sleeping. Oh brother he is going to cry....... 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Feeling patronised is your own mindset. I hope we are not going to have to listen to Sikhakane again.

Pretorius really rambling :( zzzzzzzzzz "Judge Zondo and Prez Zuma are ""swaers""????" No rebuttal by Pretorius of constitutional matter of invalid procedures to establish Commission!!!! Pretorius throwing Judge Zondo under the bus!!!! He is putting up the Judge to rule for himself instead of points of law :'( Sit down please! #shembokazem.....because likely other ppl using African nomdeplumes IFP defeated the British settlers in the Zulu wars lol @ zakhele New South Africa would not have been possible without the cooperation of the IFP IFP and Zuma are all subjects of King Goodwill Zweletini
Tay,DCJ is clever. He is playing along because he wants the Zuma team to bite the bait Option 2 of the Zuma is for Zuma to be given a red carpet approach by the Commission. They want to have thei cake and eat at the same time Creation of the environment that suits Zuma to rumble and talk of his conspiracy theory? Adv Pretorious must come in now Sanitaization in progress Doctrine of necessity in cases of emergency Adv Pretorious is spot on Seeking justice is an arduous process in nature DCJ is precisely playing his role as an impartial judge political conspiracies Adv Pretorious isvery analytical and concise in approach Well done Adv Pretorious! Sc Adv Pretorious si a legal supremo "Adv Paul Joseph Pretorius has previously appeared as an acting judge in the High Court Adv Pretorius is not in the business of massaging egos Chairman of an Inquisitorial Commission @Lebo Tau He is well experienced and has a legal sharp mind Crystal clear points Adv Prestorius is BOSS ADV PRESTORIUS IS BOSS Sikhakhane has nothing to say except spoiling for a fight

Brian,OK skip the commission and go straight to court He makes himself equal to the Judge? Thuli initiated the idea of a commission - how can it be politically initiated @ Melds Of course they do. All those who were guilty felt so. He was no exception Pretorius is spot on. He knows what he is talking about! @ DoKolocity. I somehow think he has now twigged to what Pretorius is driving at @ Yolo More. But he has Pretorius and his team to provide support There you are. Pretorius is on a roll!! @ Yolo More. Fully Agree Go for it Adv Pretorius. You have two hours available to you Won't be long now before Zuma falls ill and is carried off to Russia for treatment Excellent point adv Pretorius! @ Carmen James. Agree EQ ans IQ @ Sekogololo Johannes. Cuba or Russia So Zuma does NOT qualify to decide Zondo is biased Another knock out blow fro Pretorius "@ Vicky Kgoete. Have you run out of ""Fat Cakes""?" "Gee Almost a full day has passed and not ONE question to Zuma. Does this mean that he has won this round? @ Goat. Will it help if I type it slowly? LOL @ Gordon Nefdt. How so? Bang! Another knock out blow! BANG another knockout blow!!! @ Kiss The Boer Rac!st KILLA clearly you're watching a different show? after this Zuma's going to fire his lawyer and this will lead to another delay @ Kiss The Boer Rac!st KILLA He clearly (in short) said NO!! @ Kiss The Boer Rac!st KILLA listen carefully. he has since torn his reasons to shreds @ Kiss The Boer Rac!st KILLA OK let's wait and see if he recuses himself. for me the big development will be how will zuma respond to questions tomorrow - if he turns up s offer you cant refuse really? now he becomes personal and skips the reason he is hear is he going to play the race card now?
Nkululeko Ngwenya,0/0 he is not challenging what Skhakhane submission but what commission is
service ram,DCJ Zondo is the weakest link
Doug Doug,we need to vote Mr Zondo for president yes correct. he wants to threaten Mr Zondo. Zuma is a small man the best way is Zuma to answer questions

Thulani Faku,This commission is school for me. I am learning so much. while working. Zuma has never been stupid
Zuzile Sinku,there is no valid reason if Zondo is biased on this case Zuma is just delaying the process if the guy is innocent he must not worry about the judge i can't wait to here the former president when they cross examine him Zondo will preside this judgement whether Zuma likes it or not Pretorius will get paid for speaking lets not bother
Mishane Swartz,"Zondo don't have to step aside if shown there is a reasonable apprehension of bias. Zuma is not on trial. Zuma can refuse to testify Zondo don't take petty points let Adv Pretorius do his job. judas Sambo no such thing as too Junior it is about competence eish Adv Pretorius SC is the lecturer here Ameva L-sessions I am a lawyer who worked with many SC's and Juniors and no Junior does not mean incompetent. I have seen many Junior's school SC's. Kate is a very competent advocate. exactly Adv Pretorius the answer is a resounding no
