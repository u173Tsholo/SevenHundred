Briony French,ha ha ha ha
Lesedi,Here's the nervous cute lady
The Xilaman,who is up today? shame this attorney is nervous. relax you're doing well 😊❤ advocate* The whole nation is watching. yes you're right. she'll find her stride. hearing these people state their qualifications motivates me to work harder. impressive. how did the state capture project happen with such capable people at the helm? how do we get SOE CEOs without matric qualification when SA has hoards of qualified people. 🤣 I love South Africa when we aren't going head to head. commissions like this etc show us that there are many outstanding individuals in our country.
Thapelo Motabogi,😂😂 "maybe she just graduated into advocacy
Mandla Ndlela,stage fright
Desmond Masilela,@Thapelo Motabogi. She's not confident the Adv @Eric Kandekana. Yes @Felix Muyoba. Martie Janse Van Rensburg. @funicanz. Ask him / her Funcanz. We can do so easily? @Felix Muyoba. Yes. I'm not sure the different btween mevrou and jevrou in Afrikaans @Felix Muyoba 😂😂😂😂 @funicanz. This group is not capture. If he want to be capture he must leave this group and go to muthi's group. @Yin Yang . Thank you. Eish Afrikaans. @Yin Yang. Whether she's married or not?😨 @funicanz. you said juffrou is also a female teacher. So i want to understand what if she's not married? and she's a female teacher? Or she's "@Yin Yang . Thank you Yin @funicanz . Thank you. At least i'v learned something today.

Will do so. 😂😂 "This cameras of today tjoooooo @Anne M.. Exactly @Anne M.. Noooo.... my side as well. Awa camera man this cant be. Not to waste more money to call the witnesses. The NPA should also come and take their own evidence right here at the commission. take who ever is capture straight to court to be prosecuted. @Felix Muyoba. yes. Think about this. The NPA will still call this ppl to give evidence they can simply take notes right here simple. to cut the cost Something is not right here. The Adv is asking question and the witness has got answers written on the paper with page numbers. Why can't they just take the paper and get the answers out the paper. from the paper @Derek Main. 😂😂😂😂 @Sam men. Can you please give us some time to resolve our problems here at home. Once we done will come rescue your country. @Sam men. Just now the Ethopian ppl will ask if we have sorted our problem here and we wont have answer for them. so give us some time will come to you. @Mzalwane Mzala.. 😂😂😂 We were almost been captured by Zuptas and to leave our problem and jump to other country wont help us. Lets fix ours and will come to them. "@funicanz.Yes everything only 20 % @Derek Main 😂😂😂😂 @funicanz 😂😂😂😂 Why did she replaced the Charted Acc? Was she hired buy Guptas? Are we expecting another witness? Where is everyone in this group?? are also been captured guys? why so quite. @funicanz.Thank you Funicanz. @Madelein Huxtable 😂😂 Okay.

Mzalwane Mzala,POLL PICKS RAMAPHOSA "An Ipsos poll indicates that the EFF could be the official opposition in three provinces "IPSOS places ANC at 61% "DA is at 18% "IPSOS places EFF at 10% The last elections have shown that IPSOS is mostly close to the actual outcome. "Assuming a medium-sized turnout of voters on 8 May "The EFF will be the official opposition in Gauteng "In North West and Limpopo They will fight for oppositn with DA "Ipsos runs the country’s largest poll weighted for population and geographic spread. The poll is face-to-face The ANC is likely to hold on to Gauteng where the EFF is likely to put up a strong showing. "“The DA may not achieve an outright victory in the Western Cape @Desmond Masilela 😁😁😁
