As longs as the project were in the procurement plan Her responsibility is in line with spending and payment of companies doing business with her department. deviation are approved before CFO touches anything. MEC does not approve anything that comes with finance. Only HOD has all financial powers to approve or disapprove HOD is the one who ask money from treasury and not MEC.

They where not doing their jobs basically Wait for shock of who the implementing agent was...wait for it @Thomas Clerghorn ...They get paid huge salaries but can't do a simple job like this. This is a shame. The question is WHY? Now you are contradicting yourself ma'am So wasteful and fruitless expenditure was paying an official for a job done by someone else "If you do not know your job Why? Her testimony is frustrating me.

Theo van Zijl,@Bianca A - That's exactly like our cANCer government is working Implementing Agent = An agent of the client who is a government department or state owned enterprise which implements a programme or project on a client's behalf. The Gov Dept did not do their work! These officials were paid to do a job then hired somebody to do it for them and oversee the Agents. This is a brutal display of total incompetency. Yet they receive big salaries & drive fancy cars Her incompetence and pathetic basic knowledge are nauseating. Wonder what was her salary and who appointed this person who lack basic knowledge?
