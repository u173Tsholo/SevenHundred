Thato Maleho,on lunch?
Pastor J.J,@Thato Maleho Always @Lorraine Naidoo .Sorry Lorraine. Thought you ran out of Data. Againnnnnnnn @Magda Seguin Sorry for sounding silly but who is Mantsha? Thats not Mantsha. Mantsha is Zumas lawyer and not an advocate @Diss & Dad Franfort @Diss & Dad FRANKFORT @I Am Free Whats wrong with me being President?😃😃😃😃😃😃 @I Am Free Excellent Point. The disparity never made sense to me. @Some guy .Just kidding buddy. U are absolutely right. What is private should remain private and respected. @Diss & Dad Perhaps you should now start considering the fact that you may be crossing the line of respectability. @Some guy made it clear that it is personal and this is not the forum. @I Am Free Garden boy?????Yoh My late mum was a maid and i was a garden boy whilst at school. I still find the term offensive accepted my friend i was repeating it to highlight the point I became a Pastor and never earned a penny from Ministry. Did it for love
rohan barnard,resuming at 2 but as per usual i think we gonna run late 😀 @fikile mbokodi i don't think she is gonna stand a chance.... same adv representing her that represented zuma at this same inquiry.... "@Abel Matshidiso I wasn't able to follow everything @Lorraine Naidoo extremely! I hope he knows he is putting his life on the line here I am going to re-watch this tonight at home cause work is interrupting me 😂😂😂😂 "@Lorraine Naidoo definitely! but isn't there a few witnesses that was ""taken out"" when they started with this commission way back when?" "i remember some stories "zondo commission I am correct. News24 article saying that Mr. Philemon Ngwenya was murdered because he was against this Vrede Dairy @hendrix jeranyama a whistle blower of the community in Vrede Dairy @hendrix jeranyama you're welcome @Magda Seguin he still waffling about the bush? I am giving up on that case.... I can't deal. This is much more interesting. Malume you better watch your back I will read it in the papers 😂😂😂 @Magda Seguin Twitter probably? I love the look of Ms. Interpreter. She is amazing @Jabu Nhlanhla i will also not visit India. I heard it is really dirty and there's more beggars than we have in SA @Dominic Przybylski 😂😂😂😂😂 @clive oconnell only because they have capital punishment "Join me in choir singing ""asimbonanga 🔊🎶🎵" @clive jip. I am 100% sure on that @henten booysen live feed is working... @henten booysen vodacom chewed your data "Miss interpreter sends me straight into Nirvana. Her voice @Diss & Dad Wakanda charm 😉 @Diss & Dad I would assume it would be traditional. We have an array of indigenous jewelry does anyone have an idea on the proceedings with PG and BM? @Thozamile Yapi i think it would be Freestate @Diss & Dad yes we have a Frankfort @Seluleko Zwane who is it?
fikile mbokodi,so how do you see the jamnandas case going so far yah neh she is a victim now what is happening with this zondo zondo is late now uk uk news now
Lorraine Naidoo,just heard Zuma not coming back to commission. layers wants them to highlight the 9 witnesses. what he was acussed of He He he lawyers Yes for sure .his brave shame if he gets killed the story is true I k ow they do get protection from the commission I'm sure there is more witnesses nobody's chating shoo the children suffered with Indian curry they had running tummy Kay Kay yes they are billionaires now sad so true
Dominic Przybylski,Seems like he's a buddy of Zwane... I want to know who was going to teach the cows to sing? This beggars belief. Sounds like money was paid and government wanted a list of people they had pretended to pay? @henten booysen I'm on adsl and have live feed. "Standard procedure of politicians ripping off their supporters We are ruled by scum of the earth. "The people in government take money for their own personal expenses Governments around the world are fleecing their citizens. Is time (4IR) we fire them and govern ourselves. "I lived in Thailand for two years. They pay very little tax. The government doesn't help them. They help themselves. Lowest unemployment in the world Here we pay the government to look after us but the money is just used to make government rich. Typical socialist system. Vote means nothing if state is corrupt. Government can do nothing if all tax money has been looted. "@I Am Free People go round in circles Politicians don't go to jail in this country. Winning vote means immunity from prosecution. "@Jabu Malinga People with skills and talent leaving this country @Makwa Choma What must white people do to earn trust when they are called land thieves and threatened with having their homes taken from them simply because of the colour of their skin? Crime is only other option if a person cannot earn a living. @Makwa Choma Problem is that whites have culture centred on individual while blacks have culture centred on the masses. So very difficult to find common ground. "@Makwa Choma I can talk and write English and Esperanto "@Makwa Choma I don't want any votes. I want a full life The only thing which will destroy me is if I don't look after myself. If I can do that successfully then I can help somebody else prevent their life being destroyed. Politicians don't scare me.
Victor,@rohan barnard Thats the way to go... There is noone with monopoly to oppress That old looks honest with his facts...

"Most municipality managers and mayors in Free State are not very educated they are in those positions because they are in the ANC. When they say ""hands off Ace"" They are just trying to keep their jobs" If he had played his cards right he could have been a member of parliament scum of the earth basically Schoeman calm down "What do you suggest these people do then They don't se any other option "Yes Derek "Boris is PM.

"@Bedazzled If they continue to vote ANC after all this evidence of ANC looting has come out @Diss & Dad It's one and the same thing - the ANC is corrupt to the core. @Khathutshelo robert Mosena True that - we need a new revolution to liberate us from the liberators. @Diss & Dad You won't find those kind of people in the new ANC. The old ANC had morals and were prepared to serve the people. The new ANC vultures are only in it for themselves. @Diss & Dad Yes - that and a T-shirt and food parcel. @Warren Llorente Zuma ran with his tail between his legss. Moaning and complaining is better than pretending that everything is hunky-dory. You have to take the rose-tinted glasses off sometime. "@Jabu Malinga As much as it saddens me to say it @Makwa Choma I'm not sure it's the whites you should be worried about. Look at what the ANC government has done to this country with their brazen looting. @Jabu Malinga Spot on. @Some guy It's not - we couldn't care less. @Some guy Yes - but you're filling up my chat feed with your inane crap. @Some guy Seriously!?!
