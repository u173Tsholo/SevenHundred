Joanita Hilton,morning we all waiting She is brilliant @fikile mbokodi oh here we go Hofmeyer lead lol @Yin Yang
Moeneeb Martin,morning who do we have in the hot seat today?
Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,morning
Melor Hadebe,mornings
Granny Mokwena,Mark Mainganya from the IDC in the hot seat today Hofmeyr is the best chair and Friday 😂😂
Kgapyane Simon Maila,Yes Interesting times ahead 😁 Ryan what are you looking @?😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 Adv Pretorious is also thorough I have blocked them long ago. Don't have time for useless talk
Anne M.,Thanks SABC @fikile mbokodi He is short sighted and his glasses are for that problem. With age we also become long sighted and he should wear bifocals or (as he does) he takes off his glasses. I do the same if I'm not wearing bifocals. @Thulani Bukani Mark Mainganya @SABC Digital News Where is your moderator? "@Paul Buchel I have now blocked him @Brian Leaver Click on the name and 3 dots will come up on the right with options "@Agreement Mokoena Yes Reported @Danie Doesn't matter - it's still hate speech @Deon February 😂 Agree @Sindiswa Moolman @SABC Digital News What's the problem? @MPHO GILBERT 😂
Cedy Seb,Morning
bongile sango,Goodmorning in the room
Norman Zwane,Why in 3.5yrs no one is prosecuted? Hofmeyer wants some action? They still drink-a-tea @Rob Nel It must be a 'tart'? "@Rob Nel I like 'pie' @Sindiswa Moolman Hofmeyer is not into tension: She is already sniffind at unadjudicated tender being treated as if it was approved. @Sindiswa Moolman It's a big pond she is fishing in I must concede. @makhosi nobhatyi Is it just a service or is there a dead body around? @Mzalwane Mzala Is that not the brother being disowned? "@makhosi nobhatyi I don't know about you @Sindiswa Moolman I appreciate the enlightment. "@makhosi nobhatyi If the watsons would also say ""UYABONWA"" @Mike Moja Most lawyers only ask questions they know answers to only on the stand. I suspect the brother is caught coz I think Hofmeyer knew all along that the thing is nowhere in the submission. @Deon February He going to choke on a bone you think? @Sindiswa Moolman Auditors and Accountants have not done well in this commission. They all tend to have a lapse of truthfulness at the most crucial moments in their duties.
Kapn Krunch,have a lovely day my fellow south africans
Anthony Ramasike,very proffesional indeed let alone the fluency @thando really i also commend her intelligence @mokoena cant agree with u anymore @mafutha she can really reach an exceptional climax @buchel really to a point of apologising before discussion highly
Jacqui Baumgardt,@Ryan - they fled in fear of their lives "Flipping wifi keeps dropping - eish
Briony French,maybe he is not short sighted but long sighted 🤯 I have reported all this racism it's embarrassing. I have reported this racism to the SAHRC
Zamankwali Ngema,Morning...
Sindiswa Moolman,Why are you asking @Ryan Smith? Yes @Ryan Smith. But work commitments make it difficult to catchup My work also requires that I travel around the country and work long hours@Ryan Smith. Thanks @Ryan Smith All the time @Ryan Smith I think I need to get one @Ryan Smith. Thanks for that suggestion Not sure of the name @Thulani Bukani. He’s a Chief Risk Officer of IDC. Just block the racists. We don’t need to be distracted by their stupidity Click on his name and will get options @Brian Leaver Are they not back yet? Is this witness implicated or will implicate someone? What is his status? Thanks @Norman Zwane and @Mike Moja He needs to pay more than that @Mzalwane Mzala. Hope so... @Mzalwane Mzala I think it has to do with a loan he got for a business venture in Soweto @makhosi nobhatyi @Norman Zwane. It has nothing to do with the R16m that went to EFF. Welcome @Norman Zwane This flapping of paging is annoying Don’t tell me that we have another implicated Chartered Accountant. Hope not. Who let the dogs out? I’m singing @ SABCNews. I did too @Paul Buchel but SABCNews should block them too because the allow them to continue with hate speech. They cooked the books to improve book cash flow increase chances of approval. It’s not a genuine error at all. It’s not even creative accounting. It’s Enron accounting No it’s a Steinhoff kind of situation @Ngaletsang Mayet I blew auditors at the end. Their role is to pick these practices up Blame auditors Exactly @Tebogo Makoro Manufactured errors

makhosi nobhatyi,DCJ is very happy with the findings Memorial service of Gavin Watson "@ Mzalwane Mzala why Shivambu is paying money? The man denied that so I don’t understand @ Norman Zwane I don’t know really "@ Mzalwane Mzala 😂😂😃 the boy now realize that we are not playing anymore want our money back 😳😳 decides to pay Mr Mankanya is lying now @ Fikile Mbokodi he is lying coz money was paid already and it was continued as the contract stipulates until 2022 😂😃😃😂@ Mzalwane mzala
Lucricia Vorster,it is just a pity that brilliant legal minds like Hofmeyr is not appreciated in our judiciary system why is it that one year later and R435million spend on this inquiry already that no arrests have been made...
Matthew Moyo,so
Ashne Hesselberg,@Edwin Arthur apparently he’s left the team ; he’s gone into private practice @keith Farr . I agree. This race bating from both sides is surely regarded as hate speech and should be prosecuted? @jacob Zuma you can not be described as either black nor white; you’re a filthy pig with no respect for people in general an women in particular @jacob Zuma you’re a sicko
Thulani Bukani,thanks
