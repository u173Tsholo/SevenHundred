Anne M.,Deeoer * Deeper "Her lawyer is with her today @Elvis Malakoane 😃 @D Thomas One of many corrupt transactions. The Auditor General has issued many qualified audit reports which have been ignored. "@D Thomas the NPA was also captured @Gareth Morgan she was the previous Head of Procurement at SAA Technical No longer at SAA. She's an admitted advocate so might be practising in that capacity @D Thomas Are you South African? We don't have the death penalty in this country. Do you blame her? @Elvis Malakoane You're right "@D Thomas That the culprits will eventually be prosecuted Accounting and Asset register is not that complicated The rot and corruption has to stop in order to save our economy. We may not recover enough money to cover the cost of the commission but the corrupt characters have been identified. You too Was the Head of Procurement at SAA Technical. She's no longer at SAA. @hlengani khuvutlu Hopefully SARS has someone sitting at the commission disguised as a journalist 😉 @Pastor J @Rory Lee Farnham Botswana's currency is stronger than ours. "Hopefully @Mtokozisi Baleni The last person who saved anything on the flash drive was Ms Mamela. The meta data (properties) show that. I agree - her technical expert can check He's going to tell her the same thing (if he's honest) @hlengani khuvutlu Yes Yup "Just because others contacted you on your private e-mail and personal phone Thank you @Pastor J The funeral service was broadcast by SABC Lots of @Acid Zil Transfer of skills is not always done. "Hello @Thulani Bukani Ms Mamela @Michael Wild They met at some function - it was said on Friday "@Michael Wild If you can Correct @Hennie Cloete Correct Thanks and you too @Pastor J
Person of interest,deeper.... I did not agree with it legally? ZAP BOOM BAM 🔥 it's a nervous tic "SAA down the tubes because of this kind of activity She was implicated by previous witnesses. "Irritated Snotklap she picked the wrong people to try and bamboozle today "Crisp honest answer please Ms Memela "oh boy Rory go home Rory came on after we told Experimental to go home. must be his brother. "Rory The Metadata Noose tightening "Chair I had a three tire wedding cake once... Practice 👍 👍 👍 Rory "phew Ms Hofmeyr must be exhausted. Slippery witness.
Georgina Yawa,boom 🤔 my lunch is over
Kevin Simon,"LikeImean This was a thinly disguised money skimming system. RET in action? She is making sure all these people are called Crisp answers? Read the document then tailor you story. Sit down! The meta data is reliable Tier? you mean
Paul Buchel,"Yes or No That false smile makes me want to puke. "@Lex Luger​ "@Lex Luger​ DCJ has to coach her in answering the questions. "@Anne M.​ "YES OR NO dammit "Oh dear "@Stronger together​ She is going to need a poofy break soon. "@Lee Hendrix
D Thomas,please can anyone confirm if this is part of state capture? It appears to me that this is a transaction that should have been subjected to audit (internal and external) Elvis thanks but my understanding of state capture is where the activities of state were severely influenced to almost inability to act in the interest of the country "Anne Anne thanks for your response but my concern is that the penalty for state capture in some countries is death. "Anne Dominic the prevention of destruction of the country is to put effective controls in place Anne cheers. Appreciate engaging with you. take care of yourself Dominic thanks. That means we have a much bigger problem that requires a comprehensive review and decisive action Dominic thanks for your kind responses. Well noted. Cheers
Sherwin Peters,this is such fun to watch The Hoff is brilliant DCJ Zondo you Boss stalling tires? tears 🤣

JS Bach,Is she smiling or is she showing her teeth? "what are you grinning about "Eat her "Ooooo Mamela @Anne M. I wish I can rip off her head thing. @Lex .....and aggressive. Yes Judge Zondo!!! Oh here comes the lawyer again. Ugh. Ooooo here comes mommy to help..... @hlengani khuvutlu she is the lawyer of this Memela woman. "@hlengani khuvutlu she used to be the head of procurement for the technical division of SAA. So "Ag nee @Dominic Przybylski I don't think there are one politician on this earth who is not a populist. They want to win elections. Here it comes......metadata "Nononono this is what the metadata shows @Phillip Cwazibe exactly! They want people to like them so that they vote for them. So they will do EVERYTHING to get people to vote for them. PRomise them the moon. This lawyer of Memela does not get it into her head that she will be able to re-examine after Kate has finished with her client. "MEmela They can apply for leave to run away. @David Tuer Correct. @Phillip Cwazibe I missed that. You are sharp-eyed!! Yes Judge Zondo!! THis is an important question! "YEs @dada ngova I think he understands perfectly. @Ishaad Mohammed Yes!!! KA BOOM indeed. "Bollocks They were sent to my private address......mmmmm....now why would you do that? Kate is coming to get you........ 😂😂😂😂😂 @Dada Judge Zondo can see a liar from a mile...... He has wisdom. That can't be learnt in a course. That is why he is DCJ. @Pheladi Lamola 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🎯🎯 hahaha there you go......😂😂😂😂 No communication.... "Bull's eye @Michael Wild tonight she is going to have nightmares about The Hoff chasing her around...... Next Memela is also going to have some mystery disease. Off to Cuba. 😂😂 On Friday Memela was oh so arrogant. In a few minutes she will be snivelling and crying. "ALL queries @thulani fadashe from who? @mandisi ntauzana how on earth can you have a fair bidding process if some bidders communicate with the people who have inside info?? She is talker faster and faster and faster........getting nervous..... @thulani fadashe just because he is asking probing questions? @mandisi ntauzana MEmela was the head of procurement! This is the department that buys the stuff from the proferred bidder! @thulani fadashe now what information is he dismissive of? "@mandisi ntauzana it is just funny that only ""SOME"" bidders are being developed and receive flash disks....smells like corruption to me......" @thulani fadashe shy doesn't she give the info on the USB to ALL bidders???? @mandisi ntauzana but that is corruption! "BUt Memela @Gabisile Mabuza exactly my point. Did you help ALL other black companies? "THese ""executives"" ignored each and every rule in the book......and now
skeetpetegibbs,She will start coughing shortly ala Zuma. And I think you fell asleep Mandisi Exactly Derek
Wildthing,What was one unit resell value. if someone knows. how many got sold. wow That is for tax purposes not items value. The dragon will now be blowing fire. like I said is getting tired. judge please ask her to answer the question. Mandisi if you buy a car and three years later want to sell it. you ask the Bank what the book value is. and then you go out to market to try get a better price because the car was well looked after. I cant block Rory as he is a returning baddie and I cant see him. block him if he is offensive Think her whole attitude has changed now. court hook line and bate. True They will need to go through every deal She was involved in. Dada he is a lawyer and it is part of the training. they have to know how companies purchase and manage items. every big company has a lawyer or lawyer company. and it's not that complicated. and why did you use private email. Jacob stay on subject or we vote you off. Dada studying as a lawyer includes Business management. Dada we could ask others to confirm that when studying Law they go through the process of Business management. It was easy to read Adv M. Friday she was very arrogant and talking down to Miss Hoffmeyer. but all changed now. 🤣🤣 creating company new laws now. she can continue to study in Jail. Jacob. last notice. stay on Subject or leave. this chat is not about the name Jacob Zuma. so just admitted to handing the USB over. need to bring one of them rain drums. she will.need lots of water now. its company rules "Thulani she has a lawyer thatnwl cross examine her with all that she is going through now. Judge asked her to be crisp. yes I agree David. Mandisi another way to look at this. is who give your mother 2.5 million rand when they dont know them. let's leave parties out. let's focus on this lady and corrupt that she was accused of. NIP. National Industrial Participation Rob Davies did the doc Mandisi did you work with this lady and SAA. but you defending The lady when the evediance is against her. where in work it's an anything over R200.00. need to report any gifts. so work related. I run your back you rub my back. ha ha I did and still does not explain how strangers give her mom 2.5 million for deposit. ha ha I think she meant throw. Judge Zondo was going to say please send the police. and figure prints on USB Tee we are stronger together to catch thieves and remove them so hard working people can take up the work. and keep corrupt out. Her lawyer is going to run tonight. its 800 deaths +- not over 1000
Dominic Przybylski,R400 000 per GPU siphoned off to corruption. 12 Does this woman think we are all as thick as she is? @D Thomas the ultimate objective is to prevent the destruction of our country's economy. If it continues our country will become a failed state where nothing works and will end up in mass starvation and total breakdown of society - permanent state of civil war like in DRC/Somalia. We won't recover much at all but we may be able to save our country. We have the controls but they are ignored. We have a great constitutions and all the controls are specified but there is no implementation/enforcement so they are not worth the paper they are written on. We have a 'democratic' government controlled by SACP who have never recieved a single vote and by the trade unions and think a communist economy is the answer when it has destroyed every country which tried it. The real conflict is between communism and capitalism and race has been used to confuse the issue. It's not about black vs white. It is simply that people must be appointed on merit not skin colour. There are corrupt incompetent people in every race. Unfortunately BEE and cadre deployment means that competence is not the most important factor. If we don't have competent honest people in control of our country our country cannot succeed. @Rory Lee Farnham You're wrong. Look at what has happened in Rwanda since the genocide there. The problem is that our politicians are not leaders. They are populists and don't do what they know is right because then they'll lose votes. So we are led by the lowest common denominator. We're like a dog chasing its own tail. "That's the problem I had with Mmusi Maimane. He is an ambulance chaser instead of being somebody who says ""These are my principles and if you don't vote for them that's your choice I'm not going to change what I believe in just to try collect your vote. @Phillip Cwazibe That's the problem. The only thing we can be sure of is that they will do everything they can to get votes. Too scared to do the right thing. Other problem is that black people were kept poor by apartheid so they think that money will make them happy. The happiest people I know are poor. @Phillip Cwazibe The problem with democracy. It makes it almost impossible for a real leader to be in control. "@dada ngova The only thing democracy does is allow for a change of government without civil war A free market is the only real form of democracy. Every time you buy something it is a vote. If we don't buy the company goes bankrupt. If we do buy they succeed. @dada ngova Mugabe was not deposed by votes. He was removed by military and ZANU/PF remained in power. @dada ngova That's not a democracy in anything but name. Vote counting was fraudulently altered otherwise MDC would have won under Tsvangir. @dada ngova Unfortunately you are right for most countries except a few like in Switzerland and to a lesser extent in other European countries. @dada ngova USA is not a real democracy. The real power in USA is the big companies. Elections are won by who has the most money. Look how much money Ramphosa had to spend to head ANC. BEE is a disaster. If we want a successful country we should just let the economy grow without forcing people to be employed by race. If economy grows everybody gets more opportunites. China is great example what happens if economy is allowed to grow without political control. The saddest thing about BEE and AA is that it makes every succesful black person suspect. @Derek Main I'm comparing China now with 60% of economy now in private sector compared to the time when it didn't allow private sector at all. "@Derek Main China allows people to be hired and fired at any time She doesn't seem to understand that she has been in contravention of just about every rule controlling communication with bidders. Confounds me how she became an advocate. Kate looks like she's about to strike. I responded to many invitations to tender and there's no excuse to ignore any condition of tender unless the buyer explicitly agrees to change the conditions in writing. @Michael Michael Basic money laundering. She negotiated a unit price 70% lower than book value for them to pay so whether she sat on bid committee is irrelevant. @Stronger together 27 000 deaths? @Stronger together Please give reference for your information. "@Stronger together If there is such a discrepancy I'm surprised you don't have it on hand Says the person who cannot find his sources... Ha!

True "Entitlement is produced through hard The write thing will be to put all these thieves in prison for at least 25 years We are all so heavily taxed with load shedding and a failing economy with land grabs and a government that’s trying to legalise land theft were everyone has bought their property "How do they employ such incompetent people Affirmative action is races towards a minority group in South Africa just like what Hitler did with the Jews It’s like having a fruit tree and eating all the fruit and then using the tree as fire would instead of nourishing the tree and letting it feed you for years to come "She is delegating her responsibilities to other Jacob Zuma😁😁😂😀😀 Still they haven’t imprisoned any of these thieves I don’t even understand why they do all this when they don’t imprison the thieves. Look Jacob Zoma is running free after all he done… Jacob Zuma​ NEVER😂😂😂 Jacob Zuma days are numbered as the rest of the world is watching and planning to give sanctions on South Africa if law is ignored constantly in South Africa You give training for transfer of skills? Or do they just give BEE the job and hope that they will learn the skills by experimental trial and error They must imprison these thieves "Just like South Africa said they ready for coronas virus Mines are owned by mostly ANC associates nowadays Around 75 people are murdered in South Africa every day

Derek Main,@Rory Lee Farnham Barak Obama "@Dominic Przybylski Our problem is that we worship wealth rather than integrity. So if our politicians flash their ill-gotten gains "@Mtokozisi Baleni BEE in principle is a noble idea but how it is currently practised @dada ngova Police forces the world over are becoming more militarised - including here in SA. @Mtokozisi Baleni I agree - there always a corrupter and a corruptee. Our BEE is not working - only a few connected individuals are benefitting. It is not spreading wealth like it was meant to. @stanely msimango True that - only the criminals are happy with BEE. @Dominic Przybylski I disagree - there is a lot of political involvement in the Chinese economy. @Dominic Przybylski OK - maybe less political involvement but definitely still there. @DJ DJ I doubt whether it's as high as 15%. @Dominic Przybylski Yes - China is certainly not a paragin of worker's rights. @sakhiseni khumalo I don't know so much - this woman is digging herself a hole. @Rory Lee Farnham See how easy it is to say that without bringing race into it. @thulani fadashe That's because she goes off on a tangent and he's tired of it.
