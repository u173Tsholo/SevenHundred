Connie Mose,. . . DCJ is on fire DCJ I dont understand too DCJ for CJ position I understand why Zuma doesn't want to come. DCJ is sharp DCJ how could the board restated him Mr Mkwanazi help the DCJ to understand Mr Mkwanazi tell DCJ that instruction came outside the board the DCJ will rest the line of questioning And so what DCJ connect the dots DCJ Mr Mkwanazi is throwing gigaba under the bus you were asked by gigaba did you feel you could refuse the instruction I like that line of questioning ask DCJ
Xolani J Masemula,"Morning Everybody "So the Beitridge Hearing is commencing on the other side as well Whooo! the contrast That's probably on purpose on Mkhwanazi's part.

GB,Greetings Everyone 🙂 wonderful description of DCJ in today's Business Day - letter in the opinion. Couldn't agree more... @Tommygun - he will very quickly brought up short. Evidence leader wastes no time...it seems yes @Tommygun - he was pivotal in the whole debacle "zero accountability the illogicality is infuriating Zondo some nice hot tea @R.m. B. - not always true. DCJ comes from humble beginnings in life but has not abandoned integrity and compassion for others "agreed @R.m. B. The self serving yebo @melds melds oh wow - picture is way bettr not a leg to stand on like how Adv Myburgh drives home an advantage lol @alowis musodza @Xolani J Masemula - have oftn wondered about that how the wheel has turned ' o what a 'lightweight' unbelievable admission star witned "star witness line-up ahead...Gigaba @Xolani J Masemula - absinthe? Unusual choice witness looks disorientated ok @Xolani J Masemula true under the proverbial bus "aye hasn't he? - more or less @Xolani J Masemula

TheQueen V,haibo. bad sound todag "don't think I'll stick around for this
Owen Nyilika,Poor service today @Isaac Patsa is in KZN This Madala mkhwanazi is old enough to control by junior guy like Mr gigaba @Sherwin Peters is over 60 yrs this madala @Junior staff always fired @melds melds he scared Mr Zuma and Gigaba @melds melds that corruption in Transnet was a White Collar Crime brur all they get money there Mr Zondo is cross today as a chair mr mkhanazi
Anne M.,Hi @Valencia J The sound on eNCA is much better On my laptop I can open 2 tabs and I pop out the chat @Valencia J GM @Naledi Barron I echo your sentiments. Things are very tense there this morning. "Oh my word @keeran kerar Mkwanazi is on Skype and they were testing this from 09h00 until the live stream started at 10 and couldn't get it right. @Mbuso Ndlovu 😂😂😂 @Russia Magezi He'll say his data ran out 😉 @Granny Mokwena Adv Gcabashe? "Yes "@Thando Mgodeli Transnet Former Board Chairperson Mr "@Diana Sekatane And just like Zuma Hi @Roza essack @SanFran Arnold Malema also has skeletons he doesn't want shown. It's scary that they would prefer a scorched earth. "@Tommygun Yes @Roza essack You've got his size orange suite in stock? @Cynthia Key I like your thinking 😆
dominic mabe,service it's poor today 🔫🔫
Tommygun,Its pretty slack that you can spend millions on the commision and lawyers and cant get a decent microphone set up on the witness. Do they send someone to the witnes to ensure they are set up properly? @Douglas Masuku Former Board Chairperson at Transnet Crap mic in a cavern p.s. I do tv audio so if you have any jobs 🙂 @Xolani J Masemula they all wish! Crazy testimony yesterday Sounds like Barbara Hogan got superceded early by Gigaba who came into Transnet and throwing his weight around I this guy trying to legitimise Mr Gama getting his job back? Is he the guy who suggested condonations in the first place ? "@SanFran Arnold Oh ja I wonder how he will explain ignoring all legal advice he was given contradicting what the board actualy did. why discipline if you condone? @Fred Desrosiers Just 1 and a bit.... "similar issues but was Gama not nailed on 4 major transgressions? Only the one coould possibly have been affected by the condonation COndonation sounds like a Nick Linnell suggestion @Paul Buchel hope its sweat ITs all old school deference and patronage. but there was Sympathy for him 🙂 for some odd reason. @SanFran Arnold we all wish... just missed a chunk...Is he still legitimising the reapointment of Gama and has Gigaba been fingered as a motivator? interesting ASSIDE look at the fairness/unfairness and then find it unfair... Have we even spoken about the other 3 charges against Gama or still on the first tender irregularity The idea that cadres be used to run SOEs whilst having little or no business experience ever is laughable. Most directors lives have been spent in politics and relying on the public purse. @TW Ntshingila kind of and they were removed.... I had my fingers crossed when I said that! @Person of interest Big daddys up there looking for fish in a barrel...of which there are many
Douglas Masuku,who is MAAKWANAZI? GigAAAba and GAAAma

Modupi Sakwane,i hope this ZOOM thing it will not be a NORM going forward
Fred Desrosiers,they are using Skype the camera issue is on his side "@Sherwin Peters billions? lie__eerrrrr he lied so much it was hard for him to sit straight
Thandekile Sigwela,This is going creat a bad precedent of wanting to testify on Zoom.
Pastor J.J,@Heather Durr Let me check with my contacts up there and get back to you...hahahahaha @Heather Durr Just got a Whatsapp response. They dont see you there but will check with the guys next door....What di you do wrong Dear Heather? Cardboard and Surfboards are more useful and effective than any of the SOE Boards. What a waste @Mbuso Ndlovu When and where is it starting? @Mbuso Ndlovu You asked the question. I am following up @Yolo More @Mbuso Ndlovu and I are trying to establish the grounds for World War 3 and maybe 4 too while we at it....hahahahahahahaha
Sherwin Peters,The witness doesn't look ill or incapacitated. why's he testifying via crappy video link? Maybe also trying to avoid the DCJ's upcoming questions face to face

BanditZA,@SABC PLEASE FIX BAD SOUND ENGINEERING ON ZOOM CALLS. FIX YOUR LEVELS This advocate is an expert When DCJ comes back on he gets much more calm again lol Adv Myburgh SC is a master at exposing contradictions @Masivuye if there is grounds not costly at all DCJ is not supposed to attack so much Evidence leader has more leeway to do that This Comission is worth every cent @Mbuso Ndlovu Deputy Chief Justice RMM Zondo is not biased! Please listen to the evidence yourself and come to logical conclusions! That’s why we are here! DCJ is voicing the logical conclusions! @wim louw agreed real life emotion and drama — the truth finally! @melds melds agreed "@Mark Page the other cases are a straw man — a diversion. It doesn’t really bear on this matter @Heather Durr LOL 😂 Those abusive witnesses waffle on and on and just waste all our time @Lazola Ngcengula research the spiffing Brit on YouTube he likes tea more 😆 That money is long gone they must all just go to jail Yeah admitting guilt and telling us why you did it is better more leniency later Billions!!! I hope you are right We must support Hawks and NPA they are trying Jenny it’s worse than that because condonation happens after it is signed. If it is done your way there’s no misconduct We must sell their children also 😂 Jokes!!!! Their children and children of their children should be bonded for 10 generations to the state or until the money is repaid with interest. The deal should be so bad they decide not to reproduce... ...and thus exit the gene pool This way corrupters will never produce corrupt children and teach they their corrupt ways (All this tongue in cheek) We should send them all to Robben Island 😆 Corruptor’s Island Like our little ward for people who have mental cancer How completely morally bankrupt are you and how did the system let you get up there @H A L O doesn’t seem to be working very well 😏 @Elias Moeketsi lifestyle audits are not sustainable we need a culture of administrative excellence and pride in working for the state Picture is better!!

I'm ignoring all this back and forth about Senekal. I just remembered how shameless Gigaba was during the Gupta leaks🙆🏾‍♀️
Niek Cape Town,"Heather
Shane Ambrosio,Typical SABC - instead of tapping directly into the zoom feed (or pc) prefer to put the camera on to the projection screen and a mic at the speakers. Amateurs lol GM - general manager Poor DCJ - he is just become more and more incredulous at the tings he is hearing. So basically he is saying because no on else complained about the process i saw no need to complain. It should never end... We will actually save money for the fiscus I want to find the storeroom with all the white paint and red noses. It must be huge and worth a fortune because somebody must have been keeping these clowns well equipped. Thanks SABC for the improved video and audio quality
Brian Hayes,another mamphara this one
Jenny Whitewaves,it's awful when you look in the mirror and wonder who the old woman looking back at you is No sport here Adv is shooting fish in a barrel Someone lost out on the tender for wheels not ;delivered but invoiced for. So they needed a puppet CEO Gama was the guy. This was a means to steal money while achieving a means to continue stealing "@finalcutish A exc has signing power up to agiven amount of money Condonation I condon or acept as reasonable what you have done although you exceeded your auth @BanditZA agreed @mpumelelo mangali Liberation is achieved a reconstruction party is needed ANC is unable to meet the needs of the people evidenced by the level of poverty and corruption 24 years after liberation Guptas taught how easy it is to bribe your way to billions JZ and cronies were excellent students A+ They passed their knowledge down to the lower grades So sad how many loved money more than country It was simple The President and ministers want Gama as CEO if we the board do not do that we lose our directors positions and fees So lets find a way to make them happy danger comes when Malema addresses the crowd. The farmers will not start violence but will not walk away from it The EFF will be happy with bloodshed so that they can destabilise and racial hate @TW Ntshingila not one that stayed on the board for long
Person of interest,When your kids are grey is when you realise that you're getting on a bit! "I like Myburgh I learn from you @SanFran 🙏🏾 No consistency here... was Gama there with Ramos? But he's getting shiny now be? How did Gigaba run in those shoes and snazzy pants? @Infinite try big daddy
Tay,This mampara is already hiding? @Heather Durr you are hilarious par excellence This liar is bubbly hey Now he cant say a complete sentence! HYaaah???? I dont think I had.. He is now getting into rude mode Is Mr Mafika Mkwanazi reading somewhere on the ceiling? @Yolo More 🤣🤣🤣 Me Makwanazi Ceiling ceiling When the DCJ laughs He can only save his skin by squealing Malusi Gigaba should be summoned as well @Elias Moeketsi He is seriously unsettled Sooo yaaah Mkwanazi is fully briefed by his lawyer to say a lot of contradicting statements I see today that someone advised Adv Myburgh to regularly say thank you Chair.. He switched himself off He is now shaking and shaky voice His lawyers are busy fidgeting behind the scenes @Yolo More you 100% spot on Focus focus @Oscar Mautso Board Chair
Lynn Barnard,hi SanFranArnold

"Can the DCJ ask a last question  But it’s board who reinstated him...@nkosingiphile... "I’m throwing in the towel "Let’s deal with the other charges now The whole board and the minister must pay back the money "There’s no serious error here 😂😂But it must come from Mr Mkhwanazi @R.m.B This Mr Makwanazi mara🤣🤣 "Mr Myburgh This guy must be arrested A Mr Ndzeku from a model c school This Mr Makhwanazi tjeer Advocate Myburgh is now pronouncing “Mkhwanazi” correctly instead for “Makhwanazi” 😂
R.m. B.,"According to yesterday’s testimony @Lennon Marks 😆 Should be Condomnation... Has Gama been summons to the Commission? @SanFran Arnold - will certainly be interesting... hopefully a direct link to the Gumas can be proved. Zondo is going to nail this guy. "@SanFran Arnold - Zuma doesn’t need to worry about Attending the Zondo Commission next month Along with the entire Transnet Board.... No “maybe” about it... "We need to “fact-check” all Government employees so-called qualifications to hold office true Condonation is a defence argument made when an accuser has previously chosen to ignore an act about which they are now legally complaining. It may prevent the accuser from prevailing. "Gross (deliberate) negligence is grounds for instant dismissal settlement @Mduduzi Thabede - Zuma and the Guptas. Kangaroo Board "Me fired?

Mzalwane Mzala,"Montana vows to reveal all about Prasa at state capture inquiry Education does not necessarily make one ethical. I have seen highly educated people 'chewing water' in this commission because of unethical behaviour. Professionals should not allow themselves to be compromised in this way. Now an intelligent and experienced executive is not making sense. What this board did cannot be justified He must stop this condonation justification now. Mr. Mkhwanazi is not concerned about making sense today. Chairman Company Name Transnet Dates Employed Dec 2010 – Dec 2014 Employment Duration 4 yrs 1 mo Setting strategy. Monitor company performance. Succession planning On what are you basing your assertion that the farmers will not start violence when a van was burnt last week? The storming of the court happened in the absence of the EFF The burning of state property took place in the absence of the EFF If you condemn EFF and praise Afriforum that tells me a lot about you Rocks and bottles fly in Senekal amidst tense stand-off between EFF supporters and farmers (Timeslive) @Diana Sekatane What is not necessary? @Diana Sekatane I agree it is not necessary and there are two sides to it.

HALO,"Just imagine these thieves steal money at a time like this while many* "And it's not they they had stolen a few thoudands Yes billions "Just imagine that "You see these african politicians dont care about the rest of the poverty stiken african people stricken* "It would have been a different story if they looted the billions to help the poor Did yourll see the pictures of one of the looters sons? They posted pictures if themselves holding stacks of cash and showing if their expensive cars of* showing off* Many of these thieves probably use witchcraft Alot of people work with jinns Evil cannot stand against holiness. Pray for our economy. Pray for corruption to end. "Angels fight demons for our sake "There are warrior angels that go to war with demons Love is incredibly powerful. So spread love. When seeking justice make sure to keep peace of mind. "Don't let the corruption of this world drain the goodness out of you "Love is more powerful than humor. Many things that people find humorous nowadays is actually not funny and just bad Dark humor is what people tell themselves to make themselves feel better about laughing at something that you shouldn't be laughing at. Farmers Lives Matter "If they not going to compensate farmers after stealing their farmland then the farmers must take out all the works they put into the farms and they must just leave soil behind The farmer must take out all the irrigation systems and all the crops and all the fences. "Yes everything African politicians are becoming like the racist government of apartheid But they arr being discreet about it are * Governments are basically a mafia. "A farmer was killed "If eff makes war with the farmers the eff will get slaughtered. What a shame "Eff and farmers have a rivalry going on Are you unaware of what is happening between eff and white farmers? "Eff are terrorists and are racists If malema is president it will be worse than anc The fact is that calling this country a rainbow nation is all just for show. This country still has too much racism. Deep down inside many know they are racists even if they don't show it. "Anc shouldn't even be called anc anymore. AFRICAN national congress?? That shows racial division. Apartheid is over
