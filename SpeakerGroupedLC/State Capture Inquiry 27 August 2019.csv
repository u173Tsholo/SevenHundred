Kabelo Katjedi,lets adjourn the sitting to respect Watson "They claim that his car went for a service This morning they allegedly made a statement saying they request investigation 2 be made by their private investigator not police "Mandla AGRZZI yesterday also said Watson ws planning to leave this country "Thats why i ws saying this Commission is a joke Did he respect us while capturing our state Thami exactly "They shouldn't tell us about nt showing his body 2 respect the family "They will leave this country 1 by 1

Ndou Fhati,evidence continue
Zama Kubheka,did Watson really die? @carnoth ngomane I thought i was the only one Even when they showed his brother on the news...he was all smiles @Michael Michael i doubt that. im sure he got sum1 to take a fall "@Abe Molefe with money buy Z@Sindiswa Moolman lol True lol Zuma games @Bronx Wavy me too @Salmaan Abrahams iagree lol HELEN IS A BULLY Skhakhane has opened a gate for all lawyers to do as they please.
nomawethu yozi,"Yes
Llane Nkoana,Just joined
carnoth ngomane,@Zama Kubheka something is fishy about the whole death @Zama Kubheka you not @Thulani Bukani and enough money to fake his death @Thulani Bukani another brett kable is at play here "@Robert Russell a business man travelling without his cell phone "@Pastor J thats another angel to look at it @Ibo Thabo remember he has to be fair and impartial "@Ibo Thabo yes it looks that way
Mohammed Saeed,Wow. ..this is forensic
123davyb,everything about Gavin Watson death is odd. I might even doubt that it is his body. If any body. that was also odd for me not bad but unsimpathetic things will come out of this commission not that I know about Ace!!!! question will always be where do the clients get there money from?
Thulani Bukani,am I a bad person for not feeling any condolence for Watson and his family? did anyone see the body? I mean that guy does have enough money to disappear Exactly @carnoth ngomane @Anne? we've been describing Watsom as a business man and corrupt. nobody spoke of his colour but you. So who is racist?
siphelo ngunze,i think South African government is playing with money to promote this commission because nothing will come out of this particular procedure
Graham Engelbrecht,GARAHM
Pastor J.J,Our African Culture teaches us to respect the dead immaterial of their past. My condolences to His Family. @Cerebis I accept and respect your views. "@carnoth ngomane What about the possibility that someone  @Robert Russell Thats sad my brother. But the reality is what it is. A land of so many thieves with no respect for the dead and the dying @Thando Nkutha Thjere are pictures and news video footage of the body in the car and being removed. It cannot be released out of respect for the family. It has been reported as such eNCA confirmed footage and the body being that of Mr Watson but will not broadcast it out of respect. Sadly when someone dies the negative comments can never hurt or insult the dead but those comments cause immense pain and suffering to the living relatives.
Tulonga Henoch,Bunch of lawyers today...whatsup? R70 in the pocket after all the millions?
Cerebis,"Wow "@Pastor J I agree The Watson accident reminds me a lot of the Diana accident....???? Is this guy Ace's lawyer?? They mentioned Bloemfontein? Ohh Please...... Crack the whip DCJ.... Adc Helen is throwing a hissy fit....pure dramatics! Bow ties are also something they must ban in South Africa....plz 🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🐛🐛🐛🐛🐛 Helens went AWOL??? No man....extended tea....extended lunch....what??? Guptas will be Mr C....for curry RIP Ben Said Zondo is getting the moer in now!
Anne M.,😃 I was just about to say the same thing @Peter Goosen SAPS should put their best detective on the investigation. Could be another Brett Kebble. Watson's death One of the JMPD officers had blood on his gloves @Thando Nkutha From his McDonald's burger? @Tebogo Makoro They won't say in public who he represents. They told the DCJ in chambers. @Salmaan Abrahams I agree - his tone is very condescending. This advocate has just shown the 'Gangster State' book. @jasper dougal I beg to differ. Did you see Adv Gcabashe last week and Adv Norman before the break? "@Thando Nkutha My apologies 😃 Yes @Thando Nkutha I think it's Ace. I don't think it's the Guptas. They've been mentioned by various witnesses in the past. Adv Mokoena
Kevin Simon,Well represented.. master of the understatement ! Mandla Msimanga ​Cyril smuggled Watson out of the country covering up his corruption . Do you have proof? Please report it to the police. Not doing so makes you complicit. Mandla Msimanga So YOU HAVE PROOF?!!! Mandla Msimanga ​ maybe. The best way is to lodge a complain with the Public Protecter and i know a lot will be revealed.. Are you going to do this? Gee Peex1 ​@jasper dougal ....Was it not Thuli that appointed Justice Zondo. No he was nominated by the CJ. Zuma was not allowed to nominate. "Gee Peex1 ​Yeeeeeeeees.....CJ Mogoeng Mogoeng did appoint him
Maboko S,they making money 😀😀in one sitting if best detectives still exist "yah No passport was found in his position?
Cocong Khoboko,i have never seen a lot of attoneys like this 🏃
Ibo Thabo,@siphelo ngunze Why concluding nothing will come up when we already heard so many mind boggling facts we never heard before & now know that NPA & PP are working on all of what is been said here??? "Guys why SABC with all of the Public money spent there "Zondow is very weak and anytime he is confront he gives up and collapse @carnoth ngomane yes he have to be fair but clearly he is being bullied by Sikhakhane and this white guy now Yes Mr Helens talks without being invite and CJ allowed him This Helen guy is bulling poor Zondow You are right @Zama Kubheka Here we go with weak Zondow "Zondow is opening a Pandora box which now everyone will come and say I don’t want my name to be mention here or there Zondow is very weak now not only the name but the subject should not be mentioned "Rewatch the Sikhakhane 4Zuma boxing @jasper dougal lol lol lol Exactly Zondow is wasting so much time with so much nonsense
Peter Goosen,NPA should make sure of the Watson case A lot at stake here
Sipho Owen Ndhlovu,the subtitles are highly misleading indeed lawyers will have a great xmas later this year
Antonie Engelbrecht,npa is dying zonda a farce down zondo down zondo is worse with pages than zuma
Lucretia Mohaswane,"morning everyone
Raymond Mabilo,i think lot of official who are implicated will commit suicide....
Granny Mokwena,the lawyers are killing it hey
Kgalemang Makgone,Watson is laughing from where ever he is🤔 Helen for Helena😀😀😀 Who is the lawyer leading evidence now?
Murugasen Ganesh,were. is ace I like this law ace
Sindiswa Moolman,Ace is coming @Marugasen Ganesh. His day is coming Watson is laughing at y’all incl the Chair of this commission right now Tell us who your client is Sir Thanks @Tebogo Makoro. I have the same suspicion as to who this anonymous client is Somebody is going to have a slip of their toungue and mention his name.
Sinethemba Mzimane,U expose corruption then u vanish @Zaahier....something tells me uba the guy was instructed. "With Collins Zaahier he dd get death treats already bt i dnt knw how he is surviving its very strange.normarly after an accident the medea wud show a body coverd this time its just a car nd th wud be witness tlng how th car lost control Gavin Watson cudnt drive a manual only a automatic be he rented out a manual.
Robert Russell,Watson is answering for his crimes where ever he is.... he was found with R70... no luggage... no cell phone.. and the seat belt behind his back.... suicide seems possible The TAX man in the USA got gangster Al Capone into jail.... I think that SARS would also have enough evidence to have Watson incarcerated for TAX fraud... The ANC might have to pay back R40m of donations that they received from BOSASA since 2007 and if that is the case then that's the end of the corrupt ANC 😃 😃 @Max Muskat Nope they are already on the brink of bankruptcy.... they can't even pay for their website management.... the ANC needs to have ACE come up with a plan to loot more for their coffers @Michael Michael Would you feel the same if he was black... or is this the racist victim card you are playing I think it's Malcolm X
Michael Michael,he killed himself. Zama remember wt Hansie Cronjie and Brett Cable did.thats wat axectly Watson did. Lorraine nothing wrong with that Who killed him.? Makes agree Robert do u think they have that money?? myb mr Helen's is driving ryt now client
Ruppo Pubg,qyuuuuu
Abe Molefe,airpot record will assist if he is stil alive wat if he flew n fodge death we are waiting for dukwana whats so long lamborgin to toyoya corolla a millionare? never kabelo that guy he was working with him papa leshabane now hr is a spokes person of the family waste of time today mr X from 10 till now lawyers exchange with mic agh court time now this commission its a play ground
Moshoeu Mabusela,"Some people are imagining things
MmeBosso,They got rid of him. period. This is like all the action conspiracy movies i've seen. Anyone feel like they are watching a movie here? "I have a feeling that there was another vehicle invovled @JERRY MALAHLELA like for real. There are no cameras but here we are today They are no cameras where the accident happened. toooooo convenient. This is beyond an inside job. That's how I feel like this is a movie with a script. @Eugene Fourie I wouldn't be surprised hey. "@Mandla Msimanga I feel it is possible that he staged his death @Zaahier Adonis True story!! This movies is just starting. @Bronx Wavy unless he was planning on turning against them This is deep. and unfortunately the beginning. @Thami Nobela exactly what i thought @Bronx Wavy I dont know anyone who wants to see a dead body lol no planning I sometimes think we're off topic in the inqury theyre hungry boring!! These lawyers are looking like the Colonel from KFC Its Ace or maybe the Guptas?
Zaahier Adonis,Watson is instructed to take his own life or......... Yes dear A rich man drive a car like that ha ha ha Watson knows to much and theirs no money to give to people hes time is up so get rid of him....looking for a new player agrizze might be next what about the drones 😥😂😂😂😂 wie se brood is Watson se dood Extended tea breakes is focking with taxpayers money and we dont have enough money to play with did the circus take a break "the state capture was 1year old a few days dindnt thes guys adjourned early and they have mos a lekke party Yes pal when does this bozos start i got a meeting with Johan rupert so true Gee Peex give the Guptas an applause they are out of the county and they cant be touched... they beat everyone including the Watson we back to go home 14h00 Agrezzis time will come
Lorraine Naidoo,To fist story .They did not want to open the door for the media but opened the door for the ANC members fishy I agree that car was to damaged for that accident he only drove automatic
Eugene,Watson ran away or he was murdered. It wasn't a accident nor was it suicide. Watson was driving cars for more than 50 years but just yesterday he forgot how to drive a car. The car was already damaged the day before. They then went and dropped the car off and scattered car parts all over. The private investigators are only making sure that all other evidence is destroyed. Lots of people wanted him dead. @Paster J send me a link to the videos pls those videos must be somewhere on the internet than
JERRY MALAHLELA,"So u think uhave seen it all in the movies cameras are there but controlled ANC for u. forensic take ages to remove the body why seconds today?
Makwa Choma,The issue of Watson is very clear like all the ANC killings happening in Kwazulu natal n Limpopo The ANC KNOWS SOMETHING michael hm michael that is ANC WE are ourselves to be blamed why keep on voting for ANC Next is Angelo Aggrizzi HOW CAN CRIMINALS put up commision to investigate them n arrest them
Salmaan Abrahams,yesterday adv thembeka tweeted he is off to Bali i thnk within the tweet ( though) jokingly there is a truth the only media house to report is eNCA he speaks in dual tongue and is snide in his remarks not to mention his condescending tone this is a waist of data my morning prayer is done its not time for the others yet now sit down! "im not big on feelings  Robert ...is that you asking from your seat of privilege? "i steal your car  ZOndo and his adjournments ... Zondo starting at 12 🙄 hahaha what did i jst say?? 😂 shut this fool up please he thinks he is here to teach law let me also go for tea louw its not zuma guys take a break we are adjourned time to turn against zondo ZONDO is irritating me now with this skit gloves approach he is representing voldemalt that is why his name may not be mentioned Mr Helen's client is Voldemort no this is mos madness THIS IS A WAIST OF TAX MONIES civil society needs more oversight no THuliu did not Thuli said that the CJ shld choose who will be the chair "he phrased that eloquently "" it is as it was""" thats the status quo : it is as it was a year ago "economy in tatters 
Bongi Mkhwanazi,passing of human being even if its your enemy its not easily digestible lm very hurt what ever is behind hi some of the evidence is now null and avoid
Max Muskat,DO we really need a holms to find out what happened to watson? xD watsons lawyer deserves an oscar
Nelson Musoliwa,Thinking how Watson contributed to the struggle against apartheid; it is painful Many people are finding it difficult to accept the version of Watson accidental death; reasonably so
SONGEZO MNCOKO,lol we are really led by thugs here
Lorna Kavanagh,Watson death very strange... the driver hit a left hand side pillar on the right hand side ???? No damage to left hand side of vehicle. Did anyone see accident right after it happened.
Pedro P.,who is investigating the accident? I smell rat here @Watson commission +commission +commission. a truck full of money spent with thiefs. Our tax money
Dan Bourne Yeshurun,Michael Jackson attended his own funeral from the gallery nobody wanted Watson Dead!!!! he made Officials RICH! they protected him and moved him away(ANC) he has no reason to. even Agrizzi agrizzied to be the fall guy they show Marikana shooting every year!!! sound like a bloody agent respect for a man who gave away your money we want to see Watson body as proof. his remains are not sacred his in Zuma's bunker under Nkandla with Ghaddafi's Millions
Karen x,SABC PLEASE FOCUS YOUR CAMERAS
Mike Larry,Don’t be snitch I’m hungry
Buti Sipho,eNCA is part of corrupt media house He's voice
Mbombi,Bronx that's a lie even at Marikana it was wrong for the media to show dead bodies like that Bronx I'm saying it's wrong it's wrond to show dead bodies during 911 the American media never showed dead bodies it's only here in africa Mr Zondo this is not a Comedy Show 🙂 #RIPGavinWatson mxm more delays tell them mlungu PM really mxm
Tebogo Makoro,who is this guy representing? @Anne M. and @Vuyisile Ngesi Thank you! THE CLIENT IS ACE MAGASHULE sorry for shouting mr lebala
Vuyisile Ngesi,"@Tebogo Makoro the last time i checked @Tebogo Makoro i believe he represents the Gangster of Luthuli mr X is the gangster of parys
Ka Fuze,this lawyer is condescending
Freedom now,AFRICAN JOKE
Mpho Moloi,y show black bodies always?
Tsepang R,"Simple. He will just refer to him as ""Mr Helens'"" client like they're doing.😂😂" Why does he keep looking at his watch yet he never keeps time??😂😂 This commission is a mess Arrogant lawyers are running the show here Yeah we all know Mr X is Ace Magashule. Only the likes of him and Zuma can afford Hellens. Let's carry on already
Edwin Arthur,"extended tea break make ups looks like a big moth sitting on his throat hungry
Ngaletsang Mayet,why these people want to be treated differently time management guys
Dirk vd Westhuyzen,This dude is like Barry Roux
Mashao Mohale,Hayi Mr Lebala I wonder who is this person that turned the commission into a debate
Frank Mill,This is better then a Soap Opera
Renee L,Oh my goodness sit down already
Baikagile Tshetlo,Lawyers like to use technicalities to delay things
Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,why they are adjed
wim louw,"'Scraping together funds for legal fees"" tells is who Hellens' client is" Judge Zonda you must discipline this arrogant so and so. He is beginning to intimidate proceedings "Agrizzi was a nothing. Watson made him a millionaire He'll turn state witness and be given a reprieve (Angelo)
Joseph Akwa,"Without any disrespect to the Chair of the Commision
Sfiso Mbatha,lol
Dan Brown,Politicians are breathing a sigh of relief after news of Gavin Watsons suspicious demise. R.I.P Weeks of evidence. Saved commision a lot of $ but cost country as the corruption will continue unabated. "Cant be Guptas
Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 He might have been a South African but he definitely wasn't a patriot. @Gee Peex1 You'd have to have rocks in your head to think he is not guilty of massive corruption. @Gee Peex1 There was enough evidence and corroborating evidence implicating Watson. @Gee Peex1 You seem very protective of the criminals. Are you a tenderpreneur? Otherwise you must be ANC. "@Gee Peex1 Like I said before "@Gee Peex1 And yet you think none of the evidence so far implicates Gavin Watson and because he will no longer testify "@Gee Peex1 In my mind @Josias Maluleke No-one knows - Hellens is keeping it secret. @Gee Peex1 Why? What do they have to hide? @Yin Yang Yep - the ANC is corrupt to the core. The ANC is on trial at this (and other) commissions. @Ania Teo Yes - Ace = Mr 10% @Anne M. Yeah - I think he's great. The best of the evidence leaders.
Koos Marais,"Zondo He took his own life and staged it as an accident.
Josias Maluleke,Who does Mr Helens represent? Who is Mr Helens representing here? @Salmaan Abrahams thank you.
Ndumiso Mbele,what happened guys
Magda Seguin,@Gee Peex1 what do you think of the videos of Warson in his safe handling stacks of millions of rands shown in Agrizzi testimony....do you think it as fake? *Watson @Gee Peex1 the commission videos are here on YT...go ans check and tell me what you see "Go check for yourself "a few other videos of Watson with Zuma and also another where he insults his staff.He went to Nkandla
Palesa Motlhajwa,One day and someday the truth shall be revealed.
Lucricia Vorster,That video clearly shoes Gavin Watson handling stacks of cash in transparent bags...I dunno but why would a prominent businessman deal in cash like that???Cash leaves no trail.... *shows Dissapointed in Zondo really I am working with John Doe's here now... but if you investigate or inquire why would u use abbreviations and keep names secret..investigating is a measure to reveal isn't? could have been a person other than watso that man is a fox he will fake his own death..he uses people to his own accord I maintain he is alive somewhere in the Caymen islands this fella with the bowtie really makes this look like a circus man I miss Gerrie Nel sometimes..he calls a spade a spade and he is well trained well experienced and factual...he doesn't beat around the bush and use terms such as moemish .... confident people speak loud this witness is going to irritate us
Ishaad Mohammed,PM = P---- Marie
Gabisile Mabuza,who is this Mr X guys? Guys who is this Mr X who is holding the Commission to ransom?
fikile mbokodi,is mr X
Queen K,So Ace is X?😭😳😂
Milly Summersgill,Ouch that velvet bow tie though😁 @Lourens De Jager been a nailbiting wait for him etcetc not eh wheels start turning like a hamster on a wheel! *now the wheels have started turning I saw the Deputy Judge last week - very dignified and warm in person! Surprisingly not tall person though! @Lourens De Jager 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lourens De Jager,that mr x can come clear his name if did nothing wrong. stop hiding the facts and names. mr x will have his or her chance to give evidence. "the law is the law for everyone. just get on with the business call mr x and ask if his ok if his name is revealed the clowns in the circus also wears a moerse bow tie i do not want to rewind to find out who is mr x TIME is running ! get on with it. i heard enough of mr x
Kapn Krunch,someone said watson has died is this true?
jasper dougal,I really wonder about Zondo’s judgements at times "As usual the tea /lunch break  "Zondo is so weak  "Evidence Leaders are generally poor or just inexperienced "I think the audience should all start whispering Ace  "It’s Ace  The Witnesses previous testimony was all about Gupta brothers and Ace Magashule RET Cabal always use White Advocates Mr Hellen’s interviewed DCJ Zondo when he applied for the job! "Yes  "Has it never occurred to Zondo  "It’s Ace Magashule  "Go back and check Witness previous testimony  Zondo’s solution means that anyone else called can ask for same consideration . No words ! This issue is now getting ridiculous
Marothi M,"""some family members had already confirmed Watson’s identity at the mortuary in Germiston""" according to some reports his body was unrecognizable??
wendy hardy,this lawyer is so irritating
Mabokela Patrick,Names coming SOON! Don't worry 😁😁😁
Le Roux Strydom,Its clear that a lot of the participants has no clue of how the protocol works !! If you are really of the opinion that Mr Zondo is weak you are truly predigest towards his mandate!
phelelani mbele,guys this people are only wanting our time
Nkosinathi Nkabinde,this bottie guy sucks🤦‍♂️
Wilhelm5381,Moerse bow tie... self-important
Ntokozo Kunene,"Mr Mike Hellens SC must be a big fish. Based who he has represented before
Deep Cherry,When's Adv. Kate Hofmeyr coming kasi? "This is not a place for bow ties @Ania Teo hahahaha @Gee Peex1 it was C J Mogoeng beautiful language of english

Corrie Grant," v
Thapelo Litlhakanyane,The leader of the RET cabal using white lawyers. That should be interesting. @jasper dougal. I wonder if their supporters see that RET is actually a lip service and not something that is in the plans of their leaders.
Norma Mzimela,😀😀😀😀😀😀@Cerebis
Ken Fer,who is mr X please??
Modise Shongwe,mr helen is gone
Ania Teo,He is trying to look smart. He is not fooling me. Mr X is Mr 10% Ace is 10%

xolani mzolo,why are these lawyers so defensive lol. Can't their employers instruct them to apply for cross exam the witness?
