KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Its now 2:06 "@Sibangani Dube Ace isn't going down "@mr BOSHIELO LOL. You correct "@Derek Main Hm "Never trusted her anyway "@Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana Jeez "@Derek Main yOU think so? Like Zuma "@makhosi nobhatyi But like Zuma "@Pastor J I was shocked when she was praised by Malema and Shivambu as a ""black child that deserves the job."" LOL" "@Pastor J Should never have been appointed LOL @makhosi nobhatyi yOU reckon or think she must do the right thing and resign? "@Pastor J They were not happy on her answers on Zuma and high profile cases "@Derek Main Correct "@Derek Main She wasn't even in my top 3 of the best candidate! Although i was impressed with her qualifications on the table Elon Musk is here?? @Mrs Anderson "@Derek Main Extremely incompetent. Remember @makhosi nobhatyi  @Elon Musk When are you coming back and open a Tesla store? "@Elon Musk You won't know when anyway @makhosi nobhatyi The courts now know her dodgy conducts. I foresee her losing 3 out of the her 5 remaining cases in court "@makhosi nobhatyi Indeed @Danie Nilsen LOL. That school is the one that deserves to be burnt @Dean marais Agree.... @T G Swartlane I doubt Elon would be here LOL @Mrs Anderson yEAH lots of money but the PP said that case is not a big deal...but the 500 000 campaign money is a big deal! "@Dean marais But there are many or plenty corrupt Hyenas in gov too  "@Mrs Anderson I thought so also "@Mrs Anderson Was worried that markets will turn their back on us PP causing so much chaos on political party campaign but we have millions squandered on dairy farms.... She exonerated the officials like Ace anyway.... "@clive oconnell No @clive oconnell LOL... The PP just did this üôàon wasted millions on dairy farms @Pastor J LOL...Buthelezi again? Mnr Johannes Venter will drop bombs and missiles Looks like the evidence leader is not prepared @funicanz Oh she's an adv.? Hm @Salmaan Abrahams Stellenbosch and Somerset Wes @I Am Free She's in TygerV LOL @Jabu Malinga But we have people who enabled them to loot The enablers @Jabu Malinga "@Mrs Anderson Yes @Abel Matshidiso LOL @Abel Matshidiso Why i always see her fumbling? lol "Oops Hmm....@MIKE LOCK Sounds like Zuma's favourite milkshake @MIKE LOCK Busisiwe Mkhwebane is trending again 9320 tweets past hour "@david cele Told you about her "@Thando Cezula... I see now on Twitter that ""She met #Zuma and David Mahlobo secretly on the Absa matter. Essentially took instructions from them.""" "@Thando Cezula 
Khutso Malope,Mr Roy we don‚Äôt want assumptions here @Elon Musk uthini? "@Mike Lock  "Michael Wild  Cattle feeding shed for 7.2mil "@Keith Sindile I don‚Äôt what the PP is on about because Political Parties are not mandated to declare donations or say where they come from This @Elon Musk is whack "It adjournment not tea time "Hello Mr Legal Rep Welcome back Salmaan @Sitabonga Dladla I see you yearning after my attention. I‚Äôm not interested David Cele this is an enquiry not court @Danie Nilsen you mean ‚Äúbiased‚Äù. Ok thanks lol Tebogo V is here "Diane Nilsen "That was the point "@Pastor J "Salmaan lol Michael Wild you seem like someone who can learn anything @Salmaan he knows Eengrish Ciao Danie

thando cezula,Aaaaaace! Aaaaace! MKHWEBANE MUST GO!
Zakithi Mhlongo,U obsessed of Zuma he must fall again Ace his a gangster what his your boss no matter where you are You steeling with them? Mike Lock How u know they are corrupt to core You sounds like you working with them M.L You mean you can put the evidence on a table? MIKE LOCK People of South Africa this commission is there for us as members of public and the commission is still doing its job as was designed so let us wait for commission to finish it's cause so we can talk You hear any allegations then you jump Politics is like mind game. you observes and use what is in front of you to make people jump cause they always looking for something to jump for be careful south Africans South Africans let us stop following those people who think they know better because they says things that they think they right if they saying it but they miss lead people be carefully people
Derek Main,Ace is a gangster. That's why he's perfect as an ANC leader. Corrupt to the core. @R hunter A few executions for corruption might have the desired effect. @fuzile dazana Soinds like you're talking about the typical ANC supporter. @Sibangani Dube Their turn is coming. They can't run forever. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU It seems like none of the PP reports can be trusted. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Me neither. But her day is fast approaching too. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU It's largely irrelevant what she thinks of her conduct. What's more important is what the MPs and judges think - they hold her future in their hands. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Talk about a kiss of death. @Pastor J The DA vehemently opposed the PP selection. @Pastor J The EFF (after some debate) decided that she should be given a chance. "@Sthakathi Khumalo If that's what's necessary to get rid of her @Sthakathi Khumalo Definitely interesting. It's gonna be a roller coaster. @Elon Musk We all love SA but many of us hate what the politicians have done to it. "@Dean marais That sentence doesn't really make sense. If the government takes it over @T G Swartlane Still fun to play along. @Elon Musk Have you been following this commission? @Dean marais It should be run by the supposed beneficiaries with help from mentors. @Norman Zwane Sorry bud - I've said a lot of things here. Not sure which you are referring to. @Dean marais Agree - it's going to take a lot of fixing. The first thing is to get the ANC out. Bunch of crooks - corrupt to the core. "@Elon Musk You're speaking my language. We @Elon Musk Cool - thanks for the chat. @Concerned South African The real problem with proportional representation is that there is no accountability to the voters. @Pastor J üòÅ @MIKE LOCK Yep - it is. And we the voters are always the losers. @Ben Cole I don't have all the answers. All I know is that what we have is not working. I'm sure we could do better. Maybe executions for corruption - hat might help. @Ben Cole Maybe with technology we could all vote on most matters ourselves. Similar to the Swiss system but more high-tech. @Ben Cole I'm sure you're not trying to suggest that we are unable to co-operate without politicians showing the way? @Ben Cole I remember him producing a report but can't remember what he proposed. I'm sure he said we needed to go back to constituency based system. @Salmaan Abrahams Regular MPs = R1.1mil per year @Salmaan Abrahams Leader of opposition party R1.3mil per year @Salmaan Abrahams They stoke racial divides @Robert Russell Exactl - the ANC voters have been the enablers of all this corruption. @Robert Russell All part of the strategy That's it. @alan woodley I love it when the comrats backstab and take chunks out of each other. @Robert Russell It's busy happening. They're starting to rat on one another. @david jacobs Sooner the better for SA. He could form his own : The Integrity Party @Michael Wild I think it's most SAfns dream - except the politicians - it serves their own interests to stoke racial divides. @Martin De Beer True that. @I Am Free The ANC is just full of empty promises.
Thabo Mquku,tell the truth one time don't hang yourself sir
Phillip Cwazibe,@Nyamade Vhutshilo ‚Äãstate capture steals from the lives of poor blacks. @Sebation Nantsika ‚ÄãFree State is worse and sadly so with all its potential. People continue appointing looters through their votes. @ DJ DJ ‚ÄãHow is the unfair @Phillip Cwazibe I do not understand the question.

Wildthing,waiting to the end is too long away. with information like this action should be taken on people. Fuzile. you have better evediance because he was born in SA If Elon saw that law was restored in SA and criminals send to jail then SA would become a great investment. They need to give the cows pink sugar power to make Pink Milkshakes if Elon could answer where the first headquarters of Tesla They should give it to Operhiemers. and see how they fix it up and help the locals just like the airport next to OR Tambo. it's making profits what is in Zurich then Elon. I could imagine a train from CT to Joburg that takes less than 4 house. what that would do for tourists. and a link to Durban would just be wow Mike Elon will loan a rocket to the ANC and send them to the Moon leaving only the young smart once and non corrupt once. he is from Gansters paradise Elon. Tesla have cars. when we going to see large motorcycles. David he is a learned gentleman learn David it's for free This is an enquiry. after that they will move to courts. but I agree some actions need to be taken before the end. once the remove PP and get someone in that spot that targets all crooks. This was called by some parties to take action and Zuma instructed to have it. but thought he could place his own Judge in place but that backfired. now Judge Zonda is in charge and leads it now. x x you right they will unit in Jail. please leave racial comments off the chatnor you get blocked. use respect. as long as it is not disrespectful to others. Tebogo by watching each day and not passing bad comments and disrespect others. keeping it clean. will see after 6 months of monitoring your chats. going back you not doing to well for a 6 months good behaviour The wedding Cele please focus on this enquiry for you will leave. keep it clean its not a voting chat. now now keep it clean. hoe dit skoen. the second one boss has taken a forced break to rethink his comments it's the one you learned from your mother. kitchen Afrikaans I wish I had the ability to learn many languages. it helps understand the culture much better. throughout the world. I would like to but I am not that smart. but will always try Kealiboga üòÅ watching the WC Netball and the rugby this week end I think SA is starting to head in the right direction. a united country. it's my dream. üëçüëç to old to play rugby. and ankles would not last in Netball. but I like drinking while watching any sports that my fellow South Africans play. I cheers all the time. agree Robert I am so sad that we should have so many more athletes out there but there funding got taken by greedy MPs. so many sports people not getting the help they need.

Taking it to its logical conclusion. YES. Problem with the proportional representation system in RSA is that for many deployees it is an economic lifeline. Some have taken it to an extreme in trying to annuity incomes. Brilliant Advocate and witness. Well Done to both. Derek Main : Yes as it puts the representatives' economic interests ahead of accountability.

Pastor J.J,@mr BOSHIELO . Yes he did ask. I can tell you the answer. He was still breathing that skelm. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU . Fully agree with you. I remember that clearly. Should never have been appointed. Also the SSA conotations should not have been ignored @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU . The EFF got a kick in the teeth. If I recall clearly they were the only party that actually opposed her appointment. Stand to be corrected @Elon Musk Although we all know u are a fake profile I like your response I suppose I might just find the Klippies and Coke a bit more interesting than the next witness. But lets wait and see. @david cele . The baby in your profile pic is so beautiful and calm. What happened to you Bro? Someone dropped you on your head? @david cele @Derek Main . Its okay Davide. We forgive you and we love you despite that EFF nonsense Oh noooooooooo. Not Buthelezi again. Klippies and coke for me.
