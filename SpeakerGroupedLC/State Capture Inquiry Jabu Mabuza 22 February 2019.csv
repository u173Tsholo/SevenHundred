Mark Dijon,at this rate justice will never be served ex taxi driver is going to fix Eskom no privileges... he was a taxi driver and unionist. Kerzner made his CEO of Tosogo Sun. then inform us! Mayer Kahn and Sol; Kerzner are Jewish hard to keep the lies straight

Telkom is doing great becouse it's Information Technology......hala to coding Big up to Tech Shareholders......obviously Problem is that we still rely on Electricity.....it's time to implement our own solar systems. Eskom can keep their bad management behaviour It's not about completing DEGREE OR MASTER NOR PHD IN TECH. It's all about what is that you can invent or develop. will invest. VPN Networks has been abused? no wonder we got slow connection. "Errol Strachan lets move on You congratulate someone before even appointment? who is foolling who?

S'boniso Qwabe,TELKOM OR ESKOM?
Mzalwane Mzala,He drove taxis with a Matric @Felix Muyoba Drove taxis in the early 80s. No privileges come with being black @Njabulo Khuzwayo You chose to ignore his long business leadership experience @Mark Dijon He did not jump from taxi driver to CEO. From being a taxi driver to holding a PhD. All of you guys can get there. Work hard! @michael mbatha Don't to be stuck to 1981. The man has a PhD from Wits. Your education will help you @Zama Kubheka . Never doubt that Mabuza has got a lot of experience and qualifications @michael mbatha That says a lot about them and they are best left that way. @Bas Mdaka According to Bloomberg.com he has a doctorate from Wits University. "Independent Non-Executive Director at Telkom SA SOC Ltd since November 9 Serves as a Board of Director at SA SME Fund. @Walter Du Plessis That can not be true. Mabuza has been the Executive Chairman of Sphere Holdings Pty Ltd @Walter Du Plessis I am in the UK @Walter Du Plessis That did not happen with me and other South Africans that I know. @Walter Du Plessis Are you prepared to say that to the many non-South Africans who are working there? @Walter Du Plessis How about the UK? Mr. Mabuza has been the Executive Chairman of Sphere Holdings Pty Ltd. since March 2015 @Walter Du Plessis Don't divert. Just accept that you were misleading us. "He serves as Chairman of Eskom Holdings SOC Limited and has been its Independent Non-Executive Director since January 19 Why are there so many South Africans working throughout the world if their education is crap? @Walter Du Plessis There are many people from Europe in South Africa The end may justify the means as long as there is something that justifies the end. (Leon Trotsky)

michael mbatha,"A university dropout turned Telkom around Exactly @Mr Jones Parker - and nobody cares about it after he is world's wealthiest but for Jabu blah blah blah how do we expect a drop out to turn Eskom around @Mzalwane Mzala - Tell those who are stuck on him being a drop out and taxi driver "Maleka is always sharp EFF people are very quick to paint people as crooks and corrupt. @African Refugee - Exactly.
