"@Frik Brits just report and then block Fils @Frik Brits we have tried to no avail.. i know he is irritating but its all we can do for now.. unfortunately "i just report and then block all the EFF spam Holomisa from UDM claims load shedding was 'blackmail' to ensure bailout and ANC may have used it as a ruse to get electioneering funds...🤔hmmm why cant he say it in Afrikaans?
Mark Dijon,at this rate justice will never be served ex taxi driver is going to fix Eskom no privileges... he was a taxi driver and unionist. Kerzner made his CEO of Tosogo Sun. then inform us! Mayer Kahn and Sol; Kerzner are Jewish hard to keep the lies straight
Tebogo Prince Muavha,Help Me Guys am Lost Which Mabuza he is Talking about? from Taxi Driver to Director Eskom Why Telkom Now? @ Makhosi Taxi Driver's Voice

makhosi nobhatyi,Jabu Mabuza is here to testify about disciplinary action taken for Matshela koko "He done nothing Zuma was not interested in telkom Jabu voice too high @tebogo Prince muavha 😃😀😀😀😀 Ngcukaithobi is Mabuza Attoneys? Mabuza is my man here he comes koko will be arrested "No inquiry for new board "These guys are still studying damage so let’s gives them a space at the end they must follow law when they take any action to charge or discipline those who break the law 😳😳😳Mabuza is doing too procurement is corruption games wow this man I trust him No wait guys he is giving evidence they found it there which is according him it was all corruption entity to play by politics "@Gerald Sono we will be surprised by names implicated and arrest will happened soon after Eskom finishes their evidence I tend to like this board lead by Mabuza they will turn Eskom to be a company that serves without bailout @Gerald Sono I can assure you these two guys phakamani hadebe and Mabuza they turned their company to complete marketing

Bonke Dyan,chairman of Telkom....no wonder is called open serve now. Txi driver? ...Lol This guy is talking about 43 Billion it's worth watching ....go and buy data This guy is saying not that i am aware off Bad contarcts that gone bad in Nigeria? 🙆 Agreed. Telkom is doing great becouse it's Information Technology......hala to coding Big up to Tech Shareholders......obviously Problem is that we still rely on Electricity.....it's time to implement our own solar systems. Eskom can keep their bad management behaviour It's not about completing DEGREE OR MASTER NOR PHD IN TECH. It's all about what is that you can invent or develop. will invest. VPN Networks has been abused? no wonder we got slow connection. "Errol Strachan lets move on You congratulate someone before even appointment? who is foolling who? Sphere.......as company Mzalwane Mzala....in that regard can you please tell us when was mabuza appointend? lol that minister must be investigated "@Walter Du Plessis  intenet is a great tool becouse we busy tracking down your profile in coding Can we stick to the inuiry inquiry
S'boniso Qwabe,TELKOM OR ESKOM?
Mzalwane Mzala,He drove taxis with a Matric @Felix Muyoba Drove taxis in the early 80s. No privileges come with being black @Njabulo Khuzwayo You chose to ignore his long business leadership experience @Mark Dijon He did not jump from taxi driver to CEO. From being a taxi driver to holding a PhD. All of you guys can get there. Work hard! @michael mbatha Don't to be stuck to 1981. The man has a PhD from Wits. Your education will help you @Zama Kubheka . Never doubt that Mabuza has got a lot of experience and qualifications @michael mbatha That says a lot about them and they are best left that way. @Bas Mdaka According to Bloomberg.com he has a doctorate from Wits University. "Independent Non-Executive Director at Telkom SA SOC Ltd since November 9 Serves as a Board of Director at SA SME Fund. @Walter Du Plessis That can not be true. Mabuza has been the Executive Chairman of Sphere Holdings Pty Ltd @Walter Du Plessis I am in the UK @Walter Du Plessis That did not happen with me and other South Africans that I know. @Walter Du Plessis Are you prepared to say that to the many non-South Africans who are working there? @Walter Du Plessis How about the UK? Mr. Mabuza has been the Executive Chairman of Sphere Holdings Pty Ltd. since March 2015 @Walter Du Plessis Don't divert. Just accept that you were misleading us. "He serves as Chairman of Eskom Holdings SOC Limited and has been its Independent Non-Executive Director since January 19 Why are there so many South Africans working throughout the world if their education is crap? @Walter Du Plessis There are many people from Europe in South Africa The end may justify the means as long as there is something that justifies the end. (Leon Trotsky)
Selecta,"HI guys ive got 100MB left "there were no mini bus taxis in the 80s
Njabulo Khuzwayo,So a taxi driver who dropped out of uni is Eskom's savior
Bohlale Maphosa,"He may not have been captured by the Guptas

Andrew Fourie,hello big up to tech indeed
Одинокий волк,Telkom uses EBITDA. This is a questionable accounting practice. @ Bonke Dayan.. Search Victron Energy. It works. Telkom's pricing model that he is talking about was rancid with favouritism. DD i.e. got preferential [ricing above others.
michael mbatha,"A university dropout turned Telkom around Exactly @Mr Jones Parker - and nobody cares about it after he is world's wealthiest but for Jabu blah blah blah how do we expect a drop out to turn Eskom around @Mzalwane Mzala - Tell those who are stuck on him being a drop out and taxi driver "Maleka is always sharp EFF people are very quick to paint people as crooks and corrupt. @African Refugee - Exactly. They are silent about Adriano Mazotti. Sithule Siyabuka.
Errol Strachan,Brilliant Mzalwane! "Bonke for me it's about everyone becoming a contributive member of society and where every human being has value to the country and adds value
