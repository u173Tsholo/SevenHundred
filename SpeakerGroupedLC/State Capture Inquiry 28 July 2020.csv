Anthony Ramasike,where a we? thank u lol..no excuses Sir
Eric Belle,morning Anthony im here here we go more excuses
Tseliso Ntsepe,Anthony relax we are still sorting out our filling üòÑüòÑ
Andr√© du Plessis,corona is a fanatsic excuse for more corri ption and no accountability So when he presented the firepool expination there was a song playing reminder this is the guy who brought up the Berlin Conference yesterday... anyway the firepool song continues thus... "Ma il mio mistero √® chiuso in meIl nome mio nessun sapr√†No "No Sleep "the previous comment is the translation of the firepool song "I think the IMF loan should form part of the state capture hearing now already "Now "then very wild arm descriptions finger on mouth - still lying whole hand on the mouth - visa a vie a lie Mike I think it's worse than that... if breath is moving through the vocal chords it turns to lies... this guy can hum a lie conceptual understanding of interpretaations the navelfluff in my navel is relative to my stomach and the institutions that report to the greater portfolio that rubs against the shirt which nakes up the fluff in my bellybutton that is my understanding of my job "Neesun Dormo Im sure wet cement drys quicker than words flow in this hearing "yes Money printer go Brrrrrrrrr "Alvino Money printer go Brrrrr in Yuan "China is under water right now he's very busy describing how he thought his job worked wow judge rubbing them witness privates to make sure he is happy in the witness box "the judge just asked him to respond "oh microphone marhmallow gloves "the Judge having to explain his response such jovial fun I agree Luois - the flirting is out of control "Coy jibs I think all this above the mask eye movement is very hot right now Now one is following ehm ehm my theory by me... laughter is injected every so now and then... going to start the clock at the next laugh and see the lap times #NoLivesMaterToAnyGovernment yaya tea and cakes time
R hunter,Ha ha just a gentle reminder. You are still under Oath! Incase you may have forgotten.... ...lifes unfair buddy bla bla bla... "the screw is starting to turn Chief Zondo laying the law down with elegance... giggles are finished. Gave him a false sense of security and he took the bait!
Dominic Przybylski,ANC now has got themselves a R70 billion loan from IMF so it's now party time! CR's spokesperson is married to one of our 14 kings and queens who take R500 million per year from our taxes. He is the sole director of the company which got a R120 million tender to supply PPEs. The gravy train is running smoothly. Corruption train has left Zondo miles/decades behind. There's a difference between government and governance. I'm losing faith in Zondo. This is taking too long. He already has enough information to establish what the basic problem is. CR is BEE billionaire courtesy of ANC. It's payback time. Expect to be disappointed if you are not corrupt. Stolen money has already been spent. Nothing left. @chimbuzi1 The government will have to print money to repay the loan and then we will be heading into Zimbabwe style hyper-inflation. @chimbuzi1 Not only diluting wealth of citizens who have not safe-guarded their wealth but also make things unaffordable for anyone trying to earn an honest living. "@dada ngova ""It is disgusting to think that covidpreneurs thought the pandemic was a time for them to enrich themselves "Government officials don't ""give"". They take." @dada ngova In a communist state the only people who live well are in government and the ruling party. The more government controls the more they take. Unfortunately we have become a communist state. @Mandla Mngomezulu Better for president to suspend VAT. If government stops taking money from the people it's same as giving to the people but no chance for corrupt officials to get their hands on it. Yes or no @Nokwanda Ladyfair Mkhize Identity politics "Wasn't ""fire pool"" a preconceived idea?" """I think he must have"" indicates he had no interest in hearing/reading Dramat's representation and probably didn't else he would have remembered something about it." "@Nokwanda Ladyfair Mkhize I think it affects most of us Perhaps one day we will be able to vote based on issues and principles. "Power corrupts. The longer a party remains in power the more it is corrupted. That's why no political party should stay in power for more than 3 terms @Dylan Burden @Melvict Melbourne is a tribalist. "It is standard that SA ministers hire private firms to do their work for them "@Santjie Ntuli Life Esidemi @Bren H Private firms have to do whatever customer wants them to do. They have less requirement for independence than government. The audit and legal firms are deeply embedded in corruption and state capture. @Melusi Sikakane Corruption is not an internal ANC fight. It is something which is destroying our whole country. Try to expand your perception. Corruption is not only restricted to politicians. The people who vote for corrupt politicians are themselves corrupt. "@Melusi Sikakane I share your concern @Tebogo Mohohlo Nice concise explanation. Thanks. "Do something himself! He doesn't do things himself. Private sector ""does"" things @Melusi Sikakane Please suggest an alternative within the limitations of our current[pathetic] situation. Cadre deployment and misuse of BEE is primary cause of corruption. Any solution has to tackle both issues. @Melusi Sikakane We are in a very new and immature democracy. It is nothing more than a facade for power guaranteed by racial polarization. I think our democracy is a farce.
Alan White,Zono not looking well....hoep he not getting teh Covid These arrogant ANC elite - think they not accountable and this will go away if they waffle away!!
Mike Newlands,@Dominic gone and derailed if his lips are moving he's lying ü§î
Wilson M,I just came in. what agents is he talking about? he's saying nothing really what! and his English ran out indeed ü§£ "someone correct me if I'm wrong this guy is insulting us
Monare Mohwaduba,Hello African people whose the suspect here?I am new okay thanks 70 Billion Rands? We need equal rights and justice for all.Please put those who stole the money in Prison and take back everything they have. They must rot in jail This people have made South Africa theirs is the man in glasses a suspect? I hope so Maphumula
Pardon Tshepo,Hello why do they take too long while they know the truth
chimbuzi1,"R500bn gone! plus new IMF R70bn whats the interest rate for this Dollar based IMF loan and whats the payment term? 20 yrs? "@Dominic Przybylski yes thats obvious "I plead with all "@Wilson M be careful he will drive to your house for a fight  correction: IMF loan is part of the R500bn announced in APRIL
Jake L,Aye JOBURG
Abel Matshidiso,mrng ppl is this the same guy who tried to convince us that the swimming pool is actually a fire pool during Nkandla matter @Enoch Dipela tnx .... I'm afraid he's gonna start sweating again trying t hide the truth kkkkkkk he's not a suspect but rather an implicated person in wrong doing @Vincent Kolobe me too sir he's starting to play politics nw This guy learns from the best dt you laughs when you had difficulty answering the question hahahaha yes Zuma man comfort break kkkkkk enough of silly jokes Mr firepool
Kumaran Govindsamy,"Almost 2 years @Dominic Przybylski Like every ‚Äúcommission‚Äù ever undertaken... waste of money and people‚Äôs hopes for justice in the country I watched a lovely TED talk this morning...Africa the sleeping Giant that I‚Äôm trying to wake up And ANC is all willing to sell...like how they shut down protests that was going to happen at China Malls "I wonder if there is highlight video of this Amazing that they can treat state capture with jokes and clearly not taken seriously @ bev I understand your point but I would be careful of using apartheid institution as respected I would say feared as more appropriate but with regards to elders and parents absolutely true
bhekizizwe nkambule,yekeli Inkandla wena
Tshepo Mabesa,Where are these guys putting this money they are alleged to have stolen? üôÇ I would really them to disclose what they own before any briefing of this sitting... Just to get a vivid view.
Nodirt Living,What a wate of tax payer money.
Alvino Theunissen,Mr. Chair Zondo playing dum...along with this guy hit him with legislation he try to avoid answering the chair is weak to press him get rid off the corrupt officials and give that to poor and covid pandemic. No wonder ANC government officials plunder and are so corrupt as none of them get jailed or found quilty while the nation tolerate this
Thulane Msweli,:socialdist:
vincent kolobe,I'm liking Mr Hulley. "@Jackson Van Staden it was only a matter of time before he showed it They'll always be a problem when you try to justify a simple answer
Adrien McGuire,I think this witness's Nkandla fire pool nonsense is going to come back and haunt him . What rubbish is he complaining about the state changes reports !
Jonathan Herman,at this rate it will take another 10yrs
Bev Daniels,"Kumaran "Police were respected @Bradley agrees an absolute big one "@Kumaran "nd he said it would have been better ""apartheid government to rule"" but change the rules" "and he said it would have been better ""apartheid government to rule"" but change the rules"
Louis v Rooyen,Best Comedy show ever
Hangwani Phaswana,nhleko is very arrogant judge zondo should be in orange overalls. a criminal masquerading as a judge what a shame @Dylan Buerden do you have any idea how much he is getting paid for this commission and as a justice of the concourt ?
dada ngova,@Daniels very true..your reasoning is rational "so many judges on this platform I keep saying this commission is a waste of time.. commission funds must be redirected to the poor and Covid pandemic "@Dominic..off course it is but "these muppets are asking wrong questions..none of them have he is not..questions are pointless there zondo questions his mate "they all do be fair questions are failing to cage their witness. "I drove the bus on N1..why? because its my route there you are Harley being reprimanded in the open..what do you think the witness is thinking @Bekithemba you see you have got to be an expert to understand some issues..i think he handled it well there..or questions were not even directed
Mohamed Mia,P delux Trying to avoid answering Ehm ehm can‚Äôt recall moron He needs to think of new tricks Maybe he needs a change of underwear
Bradley Petersen,Are any of these cockroaches going to jail ? pu$$y @Melvict Melbourne ninja turtle He keeps indirectly calling the lawyer stupid
Arian Bester,he puts himself in a spotlight. why are they so nice. its sounds like a talk show
Riaan DW,"His body language says it all "Nervous laughter "Clearing throat just like JZ hehehehe. Can't hide his Nerves. If he has done nothing wrong "Definitely not the ""Brains """ Because the majority of and voters are a bunch of cowards .I would not give a party that I voted for a second chance. anc is on change............? hehehehe... maybe kkkkkk @Nokwanda South Africa won't survive these thieves...The next generations is going to hate this generation for not standing up to this communist thugs.... "If we stood together as a Nation against all this corruption it will end. That's why the anc sowed racial tensions "And gave the second in charge All the people that testified should be checked for amnesia and Alzheimers... Somewhat Tainted????? Must be hard thinking what to say not to look so guilty. Keep the masses DOM .Can't possibly talk straight. Just mumble over and over and hope people fall asleep zzzzzzz His throat is going to be raw tonight ü•µ "This Commission is going nowhere @Tebogo Mohohlo You are right however it might be too late...At the rate of Looting there will be no hope of bouncing back in the next 20 years.
Mandla Mngomezulu,it appears this will be an interesting session "Zondo is very smart. To enable Nhleko to answer the question he jas beennavoiding "The President should have suspended the Commission you see by the time recommendations (non binding) are issued the victims of corruption would be dead from hunger and Corona virus
PETER STAFFEN,this is so clever that he is making acomplete idiot of himself
Cat,What is even funny? Nerves
Nokwandah M,There's nothing wrong with them laughing. Kahlen bo nina. We just only need the questions answered. "@Riaan DW I find it entirely fascinating how people would repeatedly vote for people who have made it so obvious that they aren't FOR the people "@Dominic Przybylski After so many years with the same party in power "It's funny cause this generation says 'we are woke"" haha! Lapho it's so simple to remove corrupt individuals "This is exactly why the world bores me Dominic. Race
Elton Josea,Advocates Hofmeyer and Maleka would have torn him apart comfort break chair
sheriff dabana,i see only political comment . as im trying to follow
Mongezi Mati,he is feeling the heat
Nontobeko Mthembu,@Mohamed Miaü§£ü§£ü§£
Stephanus Abraham Le Roux,they are really deteriorating
jones noah Banda,Africa.?
Bianca Dafel,bull-dust baffles brains. @Lebohang Mofokeng - HAHAHAHA your comment is spot on!
Lebohang Mofokeng,Bathi Nhleko behaves like a slow learner # questions are clear but he is evasive. Judge Zondo yahaya ngomzaca mr fire pool Slow learner..... Dominic I am waiting for that time to come Uwi ANC SG disaster No Nathi Nhleki...dont be evasive answer questions the man is cornered he doesn't hear himself he is confused are you sure ???? Tebogo you are May be Melusi is an ANC member his comments does not have add value..... I also want to know from Melusi what crime did Judge Zondo commit very true Tebogo "Yu if this guy was teacher all his learners would not be ""A"" students...." Tell him Hulley .... he thinks the evidence leader is foolish The evidence leader knows what he is doing..... Nathi Nhleko wants his way hahaha slow learner
StarManRSA,"The lesson here for all to come is - as soon as an uncomfortable question is presented to you @Jacqui Baumgardt he's on the ENCA stream. There is a terrible audio/video lag on there though. This guy uses a lot of words to say nothing. """The whatever period""" @Melvict Melbourne this is a commission of inquiry in South Africa. The nation of South Africa. @Melvict Melbourne what do you call it then? @Melvict Melbourne we all inhabit the same land. That is by definition a nation. So I don't understand how you comprehend words. Melvict is just trying to sound woke. Changing the meaning of words is cool Yoh he doesn't want to answer that question. Story time!! """Not my job"" essentially." """My English is running out""" Nhlekok is trying to say that they are going beyond the scope of the investigation so they do not ask him the question. @Jackson Van Staden what crime did Zondo commit? @Jackson Van Staden what crime did Zondo commit please? Asks a question to Nhleko. Responds by saying he's answered the question. That easy. Am I missing something? The evidence leader wants to address the reports but Nhleko is saying they are trying to avoid addressing them? Does Nhleko only want to address this in his own time? Zondo sees through all this. Bravo. Jokes to lengthen the question. Great strategy. @Kevin literally no new information.
Melvict Melbourne,are those files behind this moron there to make hom look intelligent? Judge look like a ninja. Popcorn is stolen Trying to come across as educated.... Which cadre is actually employable? Limpompo again This guy has a memory of a pea @Riaan DW What nation? there is no such thing as a Suth African nation. There are 11 nations in South Africa Take the Zulu nation.... they have about 260 tribes within that natonb "You inhabit the land Every nation has tribes wihin there are regular tribal killings in KZN "@Melusi Sikakane yes now his mind is starting t wonder @Melusi Sikakane ? who is asking the questions? the lawyer look like he is bored @Santjie Ntuli nothing Werkmans have made billions from us Like the firepool? Are the State's legal department so useless that we need to use private copanies? Why don't you pick the pone up and ask? I write reports and often the report are changed as you get to know more. the judge removed his mask gloves is coming off the shorter your answers the quicker we move on
Jacqui Baumgardt,folded arms - keeping people at bay Is Pastor J on line? what a liar "people who talk to much are ducking
Michael Holmes,coz there is no logic yoh ANC really have clever people doing stupid stuff in the name of corruption lol this is tense
Syug,Nhleko is making a fine job of rendering himself unemployable! Blah blah blah Enough PLEASE! One obscurification after another!
dennis oldude,yes or no doesn't exist in the government or the cadres in senior positions - like ministers No selective memory is the case And eventually he was fired = seems like selecting criminals for senior positions is a requirement for this position did you or didn't you? ANC - Another Names for Corruption Like CYA defences The questioning is in respect of your actions - not the reports that you didn't produce Why say yes or no when you can answer with a thousand words to say nothing and avoid the answer Shades of responses in the format laid down bu Zuma
Anwar Syed,The public is highly anticipaging the appearance of ANC SG Ace Magashule on this commission.
Melusi Sikakane,@Riaan DW We stood together in #zumamustgo So the hiring and firing is part of state capture. @Melvict Melbourne How is IPD @Melvict Melbourne Did Macbride say that or he was crying for his position @Lebohang Mofokeng listen to what you want to hear Werksmans are the biggest state looters @Melvict Melbourne There are in every SOE. They are very conflicted bribe the Judge and no justice A state capture commission to solve ANC internal fights and Judges are used. Now is time for Judges to loot but they loot at the pretense of doing justice. Zondo is a criminal "@Dominic Przybylski @Tebogo Mohohlo . My issue is that thieving is rising while we have this commission "@Dominic Przybylski Our problem is that we dont have opposition parties @Tebogo Mohohlo ANC is pleasing its funders. If you owe me you are my servant. @Dominic Przybylski We have democracy for few
Kevin Simon,This guy is throwing ZUMA under the bus I can only conclude from this guy's evidence that he is and was utterly unsuitable to be a minister!!!!! "ok "Funny
Coco Thoabala,The Fire Chief has a Zim accent. This should be investigated
Alhadiah Khan,stop faffing around the media got the info before the head of state. who leaked the info.he must answer the question. he is playing dumb when corne
B H,"This is not a court case @Dominic private firms will be used from time to time because they independent. The government would be investigating itself - conflictual situation. @Spot on Tebogo Mohohlo
Bekithemba Ncube,They might seem pointless at the face off it but I've certainly heard this dude contradict himself @dada how does a Minister contemplate suspending a senior member of the force and not recall if he considered alternative candidates to fill the position albeit on a temporary basis. @Dada you don't need to be an expert for you to plan for your human resource requirements especially if you are going to suspend a senior member of the force @Dominic maybe consider that outsourcing maybe be to their buddies not necessarily because they are competent but because they can enable them to provide a justification @Dominic corruption is a tax and diverts resources from the poor and the state but not limited to
Tebogo Mohohlo,"witnesses are not here to be cross examined. please guys there are different institutions in government created to provide oversight. the auditing firms has shown that private firms can be worse than government. wake up this guy was a minister endorsed to serve this country by the ANC? he is about to "the one report was signed melusi doesn't apply his mind. he keeps waffling. probably ANC member judges never retire as they are paid for life. hence you always get them used all over as retired judge this or retired judge that. they are on RETIREMENT ON CALL melusi is empty with facts and specifics. stop wasting your time on him nor his comments minister is lost within his own RECORD OF DECISION. BLAME IT ON SPIES which guy is that Lebohang "guys "melusi "eskom was stopped from retrenchment workers by Minister Pravin. why? that is a business decision which if i was the CEO then "lead if you want to lead and follow if you want to "the ANC is in charge Melusi. so "we need not vote the ANC out

Hennie Stander,WASTING TAX PAYERS MONEY :dothefive::dothefive:
djkayzotic,he talk a if he's addressing Judge Zondo
Anax B,Evidence leader is allowing too much time to the witness to talk without answering the questions.. But Mr Hulley should take charge. Chair already said he wants to get to the meat of the reports. this guy wants to justify his actions by what is contained in the report. but he should explain why prompted him to think there was something untoward about having two reports??
skeetpetegibbs,Typical politician..... talk a lot and say nothing.
Dave van David,this man is breathing nothing... ü§î
Francoise Phillips,Does Mr Firepool not realise that he has absolutely zero credibility after his crappy Firepool movie where he publicly and shamelessly lied to the entire country? Same little throat clearing habit before he lies as Zuma. "Another ANC compulsive liar "Firepool Nhleko "Can SARS and the Hawks not just investigate this crook's personal finances and o a lifestyle audit "A vote for the ANC is a vote for poverty for the people
