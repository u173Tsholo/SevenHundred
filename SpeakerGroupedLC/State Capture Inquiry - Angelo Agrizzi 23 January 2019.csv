Mercy Mamabolo,"Morning Everyone
Phahamang Thakudi,morning morning sorry im late... what track are we on now to finish this Grizzi album? studio time still allows us to finish this recording azishe Grizzi Konje why are Bosasa offices still not raided? "Thando "And the Hawks will only make a show of the raid later in the year I think people would more forgiving to a party that steals 10% and give 90% to the people and not this vice versa that the ANC is doing but hey ANC stays winning kunjalo ü§î Not that they should be stealing to begin with As i said - Not that they should be stealing to begin with @Houws Houlinou in an ideal country (world) it shouldnt be like that but here we are. What else can we do "@Kevin Davis you will be surprised @Houws Houlinou ideally that's what I would like see as well - what do they call it? coalition? "ANC is a rural party and unfortunately it plays on emotional blackmail on our fathers "Please search for ""The 1994 South African elections"" a perspective by Phyllis Jordan. You will understand why we are where we are with the ANC" """The 1994 South African elections"" a perspective by Phyllis Jordan. It's a letter written by A.C Jordan's wife @Michael Michael lets hope the PIC inquiry will get to that too @Titi Pitso üòÇüòÇüòÇüòè I can tell you now no party in SA is worth our votes but unfortunately we can't all stay home and not vote. Ideal election outcome is to not have any party with majority vote. They must all govern hand-to-hand maybe just maybe that way they will be able to guard each other "Blood brothers Agrizzi is sleeping üòÇüòÇ @Samkelo Ngema he was üòÇ did you see him waking up? üòÇ where is this Gilleingham (sp) guy they talking about? Is he still employed by government? Hau kanti we still not done with the affidavit? Cula Grizzi cula boy üé§

Ngqapheli Mchunu,The state capture inquiry reveals that corruption is more about money than race. The urge to make corruption a 'black' trait has always been untoward.
Blacks Whites,guys is me Nkosinathi is sing
Orapeleng Tawana,WHERE ARE THE EFF IDIOTS TODAY?
Houws Houlinou,@Phahamang Thakudi They are waiting until the perpetrators are on a plane and then they will issue a warrant of arrest @Julian Martinez So the corrupt officials who took money are innocent victims of Freemasons? @Phahamang Thakudi What do you think will happen to you if you steal 10% of income from your employer? @Phahamang Thakudi Just illustrating how far our moral compass have shifted. We are grateful if they only steal a little. @Phahamang Thakudi Only in South Africa. You get hijacked and then praise the Lord they didn't shoot your 2 year old on the back seat @Julian Martinez We need accountability in this country - BY INDIVIDUALS. People have the freedom of choice. They choose to be criminal or not @Phahamang Thakudi Not let the governing party get the majority vote. Let the opposition be the majority to serve the interest of the citizens @Phahamang Thakudi No matter who wins the election. The opposition should have the power to hold the governing party to account if they don't serve South Africa's interests. @Phahamang Thakudi The ANC had the majority vote. That is why they could just cover up corruption without fear. They just steamrolled everyone @MIKE LOCK They saved themselves alright
Dennis Martin Topkin,corruption is white man. thing divide and rule

the village boi,may i please have R486 million to start my farming project The Freemasons use corrupt law enforcement as an armoured car to secure the arrival and distribution of incoming shipments of illegal drugs/narcotics.
Goitsimang Mogorosi,"With all of this happening 
Kevin Davis,actually we should thank the watsons as this saga should put the ANC out of power surely the people can't vote for thia lot thakudi are u trying to say I am from.the UK that the south African citizens will vote for corruption in the UK Theresa will be forced out on Brexit alone far less than the rot here if u are white brothers let's get out while we can what African country is run properly thando please answer and whites are also far behind when it comes to fashion yea the whites refuse to wear wigs and blacks well the entire nation wears wigs buy a wig white ladies that's looks so cool and more advise for the whitea to save petrol we all need to jump into mini busses you split the Petrol 16 ways and whites call blacks barbaric when they behave so well lol we shud feel ashamed of ourselves thando why do you guys make that educated noise when one of your leaders speak lol thando have you ever been to the Kruger park
Titi Pitso,Let's wait for the Commission to take its own course and not crucify ANC because of a few rotten potatoes. I agree with jail term for the thieves "Let's give ANC another chance I do understand your pain which is mine as well and but we need to give Cyril a chance. "Yes but we must understand how Cyril works the weekend Finance Minister was not removed "it's scary Eish Agreed
Vuxaka kiston Madebani,I think next a ACSA airport company South African.Bosasa was there for more than 20 years there on security industry
Benny Bala,@Titi Pitso Unfortunately it's not the few.Zuma once said No-one is clean in the ANC. @Tlou Chris So true and they are not willing to deliver us from poverty. The ANC is arrogant. @Titi Pitso These individuals should long have been prosecuted. It all happened under everybody's watch in the ANC. It's painful. Betrayal of the trust and loyalty. For more than 20 years. Too much. @Blaze 613 Everything happened under Cyril's watch as a dep. President of the country. He had all the necessary powers to blow a whistle. How many chances does a leader need to deliver? Cyril was busy enriching himself. He did not care. Why must he care now? "@Nqobile Ncube It can lay the basis of one being investigated and prosecuted by law. If actions are unconstitutional
MIKE DURBAN,@Kevin.....My friend...sorry to say but......This Is Africa.....the ANC are seen as Saviors...no matter what... Shame......commie policy is ok with the ANC.. @Mxolisi......Spot on Bra... @Michael....they too must be charged etc.... @Titi.......sorry friend.......the ANC suppoted Gupta's and Co...... Therefore....ANC corrupt etc... Guys......just remember this......Cyril and co....are all cut from the same ANC cloth.......don't trust them too much i'm afraid... Mmmm////then we will see who has hidden agenda's @Thando.....Mmmmmm.......Communist Change hey... @Thando...NO....not when it means a communistic future..... Guys...Communistic ideology is NOT welacome in OUR SA... Guys.......Communism is Not the way to go..... DA will take over...... I reckon that the DA are the Lesser of all the evils... We will see.... Like i say...the lesser of all the evils.... You'all know...politics is a dirty word.... @ Thando.......shame typical reaction... @ Thisa........spot on.. Always the race card...hey.. Eeeeesh...guys.....communists and revolutionaries are not welcome here in SA..... Don't worry guys.......the Marines are coming.....
Tumelo ndlazi,jaw dropping evidence
Nizibone Madabane,I wonder what informs Agrizzi's decision to testify
Prescott Smith's Fly Fishing Academy,The ANC from what I can see are no different than our situation here in The Bahamas. political index and not economic INDEPENDENCE for BAHAMIANS. The COLONIAL status quo is still in CONTROL
Daniel Prinsloo,the Bahamas are controlled by the Clintons
Nqobile Ncube,"this is the world we leave in you can only be liable to what happens to your life anything after it is outside your hands. "every political party has people of influence behind @Khalid Mather do you think this commission is about justice?? well let us wait and see if it will put our minds at ease.
Mxolisi Percival,Stealing has nothing to do with race but greediness "This should widely open our eyes on who to vote for
Tlou Chris,ANC will always loot money by the vehicle called tenders or Ratanang Trust or Zuma foundation that is how politicians steal money of tax pay! "politicians will never care about the poor people tenders belong to Politicians or they friends not poor people!

I have not voted in the last general elections....I saw this coming Politicians are not known for emotional intelligence...its mostly about power.Only a few have the interests of the people at heart. We are multitasking...and I will never be told to shut up.This is a public forum. Unfortunately we dont vote for a president but a party...the way its going he may not even be ANC's choice after the elections Did anyone ever see the EFF leaders on the ground destroying entities like shops etc? They know their folowers aee brainwashed and will go to jail for them There were only Khoi and San here when colonisers came and others from the great lakes regions Over and out

In a few years from now Thando and his buddies will be in front of the protest asking for food. Like those in Zimbabwe.

Attack and insulted Thabo Mbeki Malema endorsed economic policies of Venezuela now he condemns EFF is a fascist movement that masquerades as a progressive revolutionary movement Malema hates anything and everything that is meant to take South Africa forward. which truth Malema is talking except gossiping more than a tabloid Where is he sleeping??? If not a house of a self confessed cigarette smuggler You elect hyenas to look after sheeps and get surprised when sheeps go missing "if Malema possess so much information "Malema and his cahoots in the EFF are just angry that they were born after the struggle was over. Hence EFF nothing but a bunch of confused youth that wants to be part of history. History was made and sacrifices were made not peace time heroes of Malema EFF is not a future but a reactionary toxic party led by one autocratic person without any future to offer for the youth except angry useless youth that threatens war at slightest discussion Useless EFF based on nothing but criminals bend on looting the country Malema will soon be called to account and watch how the EFF reacts when exposed "I don't have to talk sense to you if you cannot see Ask why EFF protected Tom Moyane?? Why lied about Pravin and his daughter? am Why fight those who fight corruption??? Floyd wears takkies costing 36 000k yet claim to represent the poor EFF is the last election that they actively participate next they will be in a similar scope as COPE with Malema in prison I won't prove anything to people who believe their own lies Answer to VBS then we can talk Why war if DA wins as that will be based on will of the people easy to talk war if you never experience one in your life time....mafikizolo EFF only believe in myth in a similar way as all followers of Bushiri and other false prophets Start a war as EFF will beat you to point of loosing an appetite to ever talk about war ever again "We shall raise as a nation as we did before against apartheid Senseless my foot Don't bring EFF toxic politics and expect us as black to watch and keep quite EFF doesn't represent me and my aspirations...I don't have to be represented by lumpens masquerading as a progressive force Necklace I'm not surprised coming from criminals in red overalls and funny berets Blood stone age politics of nationalisation never worked anywhere in the world You go around spreading malicious slanders and claim to be politics We stood against apartheid and we won sbdtso shall we confine EFF to the dustbin of history EFF represent thieves with sweet tongue Hitler once thought he was powerful till his demise in 1945 so is Malema facing his own in 2019 we conqured apartheid and neo apartheid in red will perish again In absence of constructive discussion insults becomes a cornerstone of the useless peacetime heroes I was never an arm chair critic I was tried and tested in war and carry scars to prove
