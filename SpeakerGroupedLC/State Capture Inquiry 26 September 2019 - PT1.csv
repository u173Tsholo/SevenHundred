Anne Gray,"Jan van Merwe. Memory is wonderful. Remember the toilets in cold (Nat minister)
Jacqui Baumgardt,sabc can block him why is Cln Naidoo hiding? Is there a hit out on him? let's stick to the point zplease1 @Jane - IN camera "Eish 😀 and X would be better we need a non-verbal analyst to evaluate demeanour like when your eyes shift to the left - it means you are lying the liars in this commission talk a lot and then change their story we've seen quite a few no names - no packdrill I'm a politician - in camera 😀 @Gee Peex1 easy to find. I would have changed my surname to something like Govender or Moodley 🐟 that's what I call my car 🚗 #I'mstaying yay!
Derick Randell,apartheid worked for whites at the expense of everyone else
Salmaan Abrahams,hello Jan your ilk got enough free over the years even the poor whites houses were palaces viva eff viva amandla no coloured ppl are not coz it only gave electricity to the few durr naidoo is a crook of note its Ace how about we all advance a name of who naidoo is lol jan u miss ur women not being exposed to real men "from what I see  is this Kevin bra for real I'm targeting jan andre I want to show him his view is not reflective of many whites
Vuyisani Sikobi,Ignore. If you argue with a fool people will not know the difference.
Kay Kay,what does cln Naidoo want to hide? Is it his identity or the information from the public domain? Is Naidoo trying to hide his identity or the information he has to give? who's the witness?
Sibusiso Tshikovhi,Nawu umhlola
Smart Guys,Jan go back to Holland
Wilson M,Hi youtube troll Jan van der Merve
Easy D,@ Gee Peex1.. yes i agree that's also my conclusion..
Jane .Blamire,Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo is in witness protection. He is the whistleblower who supplied info to the investigators he was going to testify on camera This witness has to be protected. It is his location that is secret They will kill him if they find him All the corrupt cops lawyers fighting not to have him testify all the implicated persons!!! their lawyers are in a queue....
Gauta Kgang,😂shem @Jan Van der Merwe lol @Gee Peex1
SMOKING GUN ENTERTAINMENT,"naidoo's face is on google
André du Plessis,salmaan generalise why don't you someone email the picture to the witness bloody agents f007? I am agent F08 pronounced fok8 I have special cover secret agents have no demeanor cagey is not a demeanor it's a state guarded secret I agree Gert. every single one of them gershin but people won't be paid off they use Google no they need a 3d model the live person and a generic sample I agree Tebogo it's as effective as the Mugabe funeral """I think he would be aware of the application"" please get him in to confirm this" they should be digital "no Shaun21  erm... that's because that was their flag for the past 100 years... making the Union Jack the symbol of Western democracy is a stretch the British flag is subject to royal rule """in camera"" a term that means two different thing in court" """in camera"" English means there's a camera in the room. ""in camera"" Latin means in private which means no camera" 😂😂 Lorraine he's safe as houses there are so many Naidoos and Zondos in KZN... 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 this is a waste of bandwidth and tax money
Desmond Louw,Are we not a multi racial society How can you capture the department that safeguard the country from wrong doing IF you did read the book animal farm you will know from where the country come and where is it going
Lungisani Mabaso,"Ok thank you and please sit down Moses Sandile
Murugasen Ganesh,what going on
gert pretorius,All politicians are liers
TCM737,Greetings from Poland 👤✌💯
Gershin Boesak,Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo we see you on Google.
tebogo mokone,This is a waste of time and money
Pheladi Lamola,A picture should be sufficient. These people are insisting on seeing this witness in person so that they can bring their sniper to the location. You should be scared @Lorraine Naidoo. They want him out of the safe place I tell you. Snipers are ready and waiting. Crooks I don't think he should have worn it with a white shirt Jasper🤣🤣 Zuma was president. Even if they didn't show him everyone would know who he is. This Naidoo guy is in witness protection for a reason.
Shaun 21,whats going on are they planning to invade Japan? hong kong goes to show once you taste western freedom you wont want to lose it they stormed their parliament with a british flag ... nuff said THEY STORMED THEIR PARLIAMENT WITH A BRITISH FLAG a testament to western freedoms is this guy serious right now the british flag represented the freedoms the British left them with in their constitution when they gave hong kong back to its people
vincent kganyago,this Naidoo seems to waist our time and money everyday the commission charges us why is he so important babadi tlatsane implicated supra who is alleged to have ordered a hit on Bozwane murder.
Patrick Mavimbela,following the proceedings !
jasper dougal,What a lot of nonsense about very little ! Just don’t show him in camera and no pictures in the media On the other hand people should have to be held to account when they make statements No words for what’s going down today at the Commission . Why was this not thrashed out in Chambers ? Beginning to believe this Commission is merely a venue to make payments to Judge and Advocates ! "What kind of tie is the opposing Advocate wearing  Ffs I think they are trying to bore us to death today ! Really what is the point of this and why are they taking SS long to make i it ! Beginning to think Zondo likes the sound of his own voice "This should have been fought out in Chambers  Is this a debating Venue ? "Think the public should now be invited to take part  In future when Dr’s determine if a patient is dead they just need to play this Commissions findings and see if they elicit any response ! No need for a heart beat ! My will to live is quietly draining away NOOoooooo! "They must give out Public warnings that listening to Commissions are or is very bad for one’s health  Lol "You know I think that in future they must pay the public to listen to this crap  Alright I’ll listen a bit more and be entertained by all you lovely people interacting here today But I still think they must give Public Warnings aboutlistening to this rubbish being detrimental to our health Their objective here today is to talk us to death via humongous boredom "Why Why Why ? That is the question  "Wish I could give an order  How many a Commission ever resulted in Court action against guilty persons ? I’m watching this from the UK There is much that is wrong in ZA and UK at the moment Who has got it worse do you think ? Lol "I love South Africans  "I apologize for my existence  Yes always rotten apples every where "Femicide is your great problem  ZA people ugh better looking though "Think that’s a bit unfair  Courts and Commissions always want to put off tomorrow what they could deal with today Enjoy engaging with everyone here your so much fun ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz "Judge Zondo’s deep voice could be used in meditation  Hi Nice to have you here You know immigration is going to be a huge problem when Climate Change drives waterless people to new places "If we could only get people to integrate and learn about the Culture of the Counrty they want to settle in  "They must also learn some of the people language  Ethiopia is experiencing huge tourist interest now "I think we should give up on Democracy  "Time for Revolution I think  Anyone noticed that we are not taking notice at what is going on here because it has become a big joke and will not bring any change Is this bashing Britain day today lol?
Lorraine Naidoo,Eish Naidoo my bra scared my bra won't live long.🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣🤣😚 Just kidding not my Bra .to many Naidoo in this country's He sounds foreigners Andr'e for sure Very boring Zuma is the Boss Mr Naidoo at once stage was the most beautiful cou rty Ace going to be the next president 😂😂😂😂 this is to boring bring Ace nd His cronies by by wasting my data
武新,那个国家 非洲那个国家？
Stranger House,maybe This Colonel Naidoo is Lorraine Naidoo.
Willem Drotsky,"Perhaps she must see Naidoo to put a spel apon him
Cruda Bex,"Naidoo  If you showed us Zuma then show us everyone.who is greater than Zuma Agrizzi costed South Africa human life. Agrizzi is a sellout
Clarence Mentor,Transparency and Openness is the hallmark of our Democracy. The judge should not allow cover-ups.
Phillip Cwazibe,Madonsela talks for too long.
funicanz,Madonsela must just sit down. He reminds me of Zuma's legal team
Siyabonga Dladla,"Sorry guys Thanks @I Am Free @JFK In the spirit of transparency this is very much appreciated....We would be complaining about deals done in secret had this been done in chambers.
Cerebis,Now I understand why cases take for ages and some witnesses die or disappear. What a wast of time this morning has been! Sort out these issues in Chamber and give the summary to the commission? "@Siyabonga Dladla Thanks "I think some attorneys just grandstand here for fame and fortune? No arrests And that had nothing to do with the State Capture commision. "Cele "@jasper dougal In our loveliness and kindness The sad thing about SA is that we are not at War.
mukwevho israel,they will always hide evidence and some important information from us as public
Naledzani Mashau,"No
makhosi nobhatyi,Beki Cele must come clean "Why Zimbabweans come to this country do illegal mining? Whereas there is mines also in Zimbabwe Why they break our laws then @ Gee Peex should we fight about people who are here illegally? "We must fight this authorities to do their jobs by applying laws whoever came here must have proper documentation @ Gee Peex1 I don’t have problems for them to come here but follow rules and regulations that is all. They must mobilize themselves to fight inequality and fight government whose failing @ Gee Peex they used Zimbabweans to paint the picture of bad Damadt and Maluleke as a get away to fire them because they feel threatened by their investigation they do "@Gee Peex have you ever go to Zim? nothing has changed there accept that Mugabe took the nation since 1980 nothing changed city still the same  I can not say Mugabe is a hero he killed people who against him and no money there @ Gee Peex my problem I have is their presidents relaxing when the people of their own country go out because of hunger look for green pasture now they are too vocal to blame this country
Ntozelizwe Benjamin Mqenebe,I would like this State Capture Commission to Tackle the Bio-Ethanol Plant in Bothaville! This was also a looting vehicle!
roza,i dont think its a wasted effort by having this comission look at the people that are involved in this corruption if this was not in public we would not have known anything i hope they start putting those people that are implicated into jail as way of a example so that others will get the message loud nd clear whos that pet monkey as far as i no yes shes still working there hah ha ha if we were friends with these guys eish we wud have been rich without consequenses(dreams) if we were friends with these guys eish we wud have been rich without consequenses(dreams)
Mohammed Saeed,This is a sign of a functional democracy.
