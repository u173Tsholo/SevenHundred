Annie M. are you saying this inquiry is also a shamble on repeat lol Val Speirs I thought Mizzotti was a cigarette smuggler or something That was not on my news Val Speirs but I'll do my homework RIP earphone users "Top contenders in S.A for tomorrow seem to be ANC Is PRASA and TRANSNET One entity? Technically he states that the auditing system is also corrupt? Cheers @funicanz üëç This guy testifying seems to be hiding a lot Thabo same as yesterdayüòÇ True that Thabo Kau lol Val Speirs """..but for us the matter is closed"" eish" What next lol
Magda Seguin,On time Sound ok on my side Bombshells "Not milking *fiscus "I would hate to represent these thieves as an attorney They are making a killing @Anne M. "The commission team are cross checking the evidence And the ANC makes as if nothing happened even taken the implicated to parliament @David Jacobs there are people in jail for shoplifting food "Sometimes I wake up at night and the first thing that comes to mind is the misery and poverty caused by this Having worked among very poor and sick people in SA is a nightmare as there is no funding for social alleviation "I just couldn't anymore after eleven years "The elections should have been delayed to deal with this crises "ALL the SOE's are virtually bankrupt This election is not viable with all the thieves involved "Sitting in jail is not a solution If the people were not so gullible the government would have fallen already This relocation is a travesty...I just read up on it I also believe the DA is a best option so far...they proved clean governance in the WC and clean audits from the AG Monthly R50k payments "Apart from all the other perks from Bosasa Then they must collectively go to prison "The thieves even captured parliamentary committees "Zuma features large yet he says he did nothing wrong "I can't wait @david jacobs..we want to see justice "If I had time and space I would tell you about the healthcare situation which is my specialty @Douglas Beadle SA is rich in human and a host of other resources but thanks to Zuma it is in ruins Future generations and the youth will judge the ANC for stealing their future.It will take another 25 years to heal the country "@Douglas Beadle you are right We have no guarantee that CR will fire the thieves "#dm70 it is due to the divisive race politics of the EFF Ace was left to his own devices electioneering about race "I once saw her at CT airport prancing around The small business minister was always the most vocal in parliament supporting Zuma and calling the DA racists...I really hope she is on the CR list of thinning out ..her name is still on the list "By voting ANC and depending on one man is very risky Remember Cyril won at Nasrec on a very narrow margin Now there are rumours that NDZ may become deputy president..maybe it's just speculation but one can never know what they are planning behind the scenes I can't believe how one can still believe in the ANC after they ruined everything and sold the soul of the country to a foreign family.But I respect freedom of choice. We don't deny that CR is an honourable man but he is up against a gang of evil people intent on power and lining their own pockets "When I see children still being taught under tress "Better government with a pack of thieves in control? A leopard never changes his stripes So many honest people's lives were destroyed by state capture..I think a class action will be in order "Ace Even Mbablula had a nice family holiday in Dubai paid for by the Estina money to the amount of R160k I just checked 15 hours and 39 minutes to go to the 8th.The time of truth is close. "It will be another tragedy if people voting for CR is disappointed "@Carnoth Ngomane there is a faction gunning for him "CR has to reign in Ace and others every time they make contrary statements in public We hope so @Carnoth Ngomane A troll appeared after decent convo..eish "I sincerely hope that you are right My head is spinning with all the millions and billions...jislaaik "@Kay Kay they did have a meeting @Michael Wild Dudu is very quiet...it's a Pandoras box..SAA was bailed out with our money so many times yet they never recovered.Remember she is also the Chair of the Zuma Foundation Not me @Anne M. "My kop draai "Imagine the millions who lost their jobs All this leads back in a straight line to one man:ZUMA @Anne M. it's enough to want to the oneself in chains to a lamppost I saw the name list but if it was me I would have resigned and not take the R1m plus salary They could have made it easy by resigning they lost my trust.No honour or moral compass "I blocked Maxine Waters Thank you Honourable Sir Popo Molefe "Miriam Makeba wrote a song about the late Pres Zamora Machel The concerts of Bra Hugh and Mama Miriam gave us so much pleasure in exile @Madelein Huxtable üòÖ R125 billion...who is going to pay that?? This is the reason I say that the country is bankrupt...we just are not told We as journalists? Wow are you speaking for yourself and your colleagues or the journalists of SA..enlighten us please As far as I know journalism should be objective...not partisan Journalists are citizens too but should not electioneer and shout who they are voting for "Ok I looked at your channel @Bongonkosi..Amen

Success Fee Douglas.. there are no checks and balances not even on the authenticity of qualifications Julius Malema has a pending criminal record just waiting for the corrupt NPA prosecutors to be removed. please don't insult our intelligence by saying vote EFF The next government will have to build more prisons DA has no corrupt municipalities there is over sight with the DA. This level of corruption is sickening and effects all of us. I mean this corruption is everywhere. Eff are not going to win that's a promise. It is written in the heavens. They will never govern EFF will be a disaster for this country "If the ANC win we DA supporters don't want to see you toytoying There is no brain matter in the EFF just simple minded thugs. The EFF is a simple minded party of hoodlums that think that everything will be free "Malena himself is guilty of tax evasion Genk he is also a drug smuggler These crooks better not think they can hide in European countries It's called a Success Fee is the new word for corruption Ramaphosa is the second wealthiest African in South Africa his brother in law is the first.

Maxine when are you going to give Donald a break? Creepy Joe They want to block you Maxine Maxine.. Trump is the greatest. Victory will be Trumps 2020 This is South Africa.. Maxine.. blacks hate whites here. In the USA there is no racism Maxine you should be thankful your ancestors were stolen from Africa.. just look at Africa today Maxine.. why don't black Americans want to return to their native land?? I think Ben Carson should be our next President I have so much respect for Ben. Maxine.. Ben Carson should be South Africa's President Maxine "Maxine.. Obama was America's worst President ever Obama was born in Kenya so what is it... True story. Christianity was out the window until Trump win. Cyril was making his billions He is referring to Julius Malema.. cheap talk and ignorant people No leave Maxine alone

Cerebis,Is Popo and Brian family members? EFF = ANCYL Well done Popo! Now lay criminal charges against alla concerned! When is Transnet going to pay the pensioners the money stolen from their pension fund?? @Madelein Huxtable It reads roughly: WHEN WHEN THE BIRDS ARE LOOKING TO LOOK AT THE HANDS OF THE BIRDS OR WHITE AND WATER. BACK TO THE BODY HE IS INVOLVED WITH BEAUTIFUL "@Mzalwane Mzala As I understand it "@Mzalwane Mzala Ohh ok
Mzalwane Mzala,Popo Molefe successfully challenged a 3.5 Billion Rands trains contract and saved the country some money. 'Swifambo loses SCA bid to retain R3.5bn 'tall trains' Prasa tender'. (NEWS24) 'locomotive supplier Swifambo Rail Leasing has lost a Supreme Court of Appeal challenge to a High Court order that stripped it of a R3.5bn tender with Prasa. "This Molefe also led a move that sought to recoup R2.6bn paid to Swifambo. "Swifambo did not supply the full complement of trains as required under the contract Who is that @dm70? @david jacobs Who are these people who implicated in this and are going to parliament? Who are the people who are implicated in this case who are going to parliament? Do they have names? "@#dm70 How can you call for the punishment of people but you are scared of naming them before they are 'found guilty'. You insist that they have a right not to be named but hat have no right not be punished I now know what kind of people I am discussing with. Is she implicated in this case? Even the EFF has vowed not to prop the DA into power again. @david jacobs Is there something called collective responsibility in law? The EFF has vowed to kick the DA out of those municipalities it supported them in @david jacobs I thought we were dealing with criminaly punishing looters. All polls point to an ANC victory All polls point to an increase in EFF support. All polls point to an decrease in DA support. "All polls point to a decrease in DA support A win is 50% plus 1 @Marvel Ramatshela Let us quote the Polls IRR place the ANC at 54.7% IRR which is led by pro DA liberals places the DA at 21.8% The DA's list is made up of 58% white reps in a country that is over 70% black IRR poll says the EFF is likely to grow to 12.2. @Thando Nkutha At some point I thought you were an EFF supporter my brother. has there been a change of attitude or was I wrong? What i can not argue against is that the EFF is likely to govern the City of Tshwane after these elections and the DA have acknowledged that by placing the current mayor on their provincial list. I will not be shocked if they bring Floyd to be the mayor. @Prinasha Mothilal You still have to learn that what you want does not necessarily drive politics. I did not say I want. I am analyzing based on the balance of forces. I leave 'want' to you. The second poll to consider is that of CSDA CSDA places the ANC at 56% CSDA poll says the DA's electoral support has decreased to 13 % Centre for Social Development in Africa (CSDA) @Thando Nkutha CSDA poll says the EFF's electoral support has increased to 9 % All reasonable people must have been angry or disappointed to learn that the SIU investigated Bosasa and its report and recommendations were not acted upon by the NPA for 10 years. "To ensure that SIU reports are quickly dealt with "Now the SIU need not the next poll to consider is that of Markdata The Markdata poll places the ANC support at 60.6% The Markdata poll says the DA's support has decreased to 20.3% The Markdata poll says the EFF's support is at 11.5% @Kirk gemmell Must the Zuma court case be abandoned and he be sentenced without going through court? "Ipsos poll palces ANC support at 61% You need to decide whether you want jungle justice or we follow the law for everyone. "The Afrobarometer poll places the ANC support at 65.8% When we say everyone is equal before the law that must apply even to those you hate. There is a court case. Do you believe in the rule of law for everyone? Al the polls say Mmusi Maimane will be the first DP/DA leader who did not grow its electoral support since 1994. Quo vadis? For your sake @Kirk gemmell I hope you have heard of something called methodology. @Thando Nkutha That is exactly the question of methodology. What percentage of South Africans have access to the internet and spend time in the social media? Tomorrow is only win for the majority of South Africans Exactly @Thando Nkutha . @Cerebis the one I was responding to was internet based as Thando said. "Fellow South Africans @Cerebis I agree

#dm70,why are people not being dragged to court now. giving them time gets them formulating a strategy to beat the system or hide evidence. all along I underestimated the rot in this capture. these guys are evil and should die in prison. am worried that some people fingered in the rot are on their way to parliament. how can you have thieves representing people in parliament. Cyril needs to get heads rolling Mzalwane have you not seen the ANC list? Mzalwane we all know them. I will not name people before found guilty. "Yes "Yeah "we need to do away with this ANC I have already voted in UK. I live in Ireland DA will get atleast 35% ANC will see a reduction in % to the 50s "Mzalwane EFF are just noise makers but not ideal leaders "DA isn't racist EFF doesn't have a strategy beyond Zuma and land grabbing we need to think economically and stop this locality business. ANC is looting resources and I don't see them being sent to jail because all of them have smolanyana skeletons honestly EFF can't move beyond land grabs and Zuma. ask them what their strategy is moving forward and you will get dololo answer. "Egni you can't lead a nation when you have no respect like EFF and BLF EFF are just on cloud 9. they strategy is not feasible. it's just a 2 year old dream
david jacobs,they stole our money period i want to steal that amount and see how far it will get me @Felix Muyoba eish @Magda Seguin Exactly they must take collective responsibilty for stealing the money @#dm70 Cyril cant do nothing his hands is tied @Mzalwane Mzala in reference to the ANC list lol they must be moved out of South Africa i dont want to feed them whilst in jail they have taken too much already Gavin will find out how prisoners will treat him Dudu gave her LV bag back to Gavin for that he will spend time a long time with Papa in jail @Mzalwane Mzala dont you know ?

Kapn Krunch,Google online how many of the ANC politicians have criminal records the amount that have more then one convictions are above 50% of the entire party the DA has service delivery that speaks for itself I say that as a jozi boy that's visited capetown the way the DA is seen is a result of the only way the ANC gets votes by making everything black and white my problem with eff is they want to nationalize everything after we just had to sell eskom and telkom just to make the infrastructure function and he wants everything to be government run they advocate for government owning all business when government cant handle their current responsibilities it's simply madness
