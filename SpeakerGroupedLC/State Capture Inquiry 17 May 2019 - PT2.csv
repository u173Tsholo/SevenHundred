Papi Jan,the commission of zondo "the prosses for state capture is going to leave zuma and his cabined in jail now. remember ramaphosa is not acting now
Marvel Ramatshela,all this educated chaps allowed to be bullied to become puppets of a foreign family brothers. what's a shame Almost everyone knew about the corruption and misconduct led by the Guptas. we are only been told now when they've gone already. "I thought educated folks are not easy to be bought "No one blew the whistles Our money have been blown up just to carer the just to cater for 1 family and Zuma As I wait to see them go to jail. The only ANC chaps who went to prison for corruption is Convict Tony Yengeni and late Mr J Selebi out of 1000s we know Netherlands is closing prisons because the they are no more criminals to incarcerate Maybe let's borrow their prisons end send the corrupt morons there "They messed up our country they chowed a lot of money
Derek Main,@Jean Hou You must be ANC @Marvel Ramatshela Yes - everybody knew except the ANC - or so they say. "@Papi Jan When that happens We need to start building more prisons for all the ANC criminals. Netherlands don't have the ANC to deal with. I'd be happy with that but I doubt whether they would. @Felix Muyoba I disagree - I know many poor people who are fine upstanding citizens. That's a lame excuse for the ANC. No problem - I do agree that inequality is something that has to be dealt with. The wage gap is obscene. Yes - it seems the wealthy are the worst criminals @Felix Muyoba . Their greed makes them become sociopaths.

Felix Muyoba,inequality is what breeds criminality i apologise..i am wrong on this one.. i agree with you @Derek Main..some people still commit criminality though they have plenty..it is just greed.. true
