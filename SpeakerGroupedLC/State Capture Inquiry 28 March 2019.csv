Bosasa had EVERY government contract mos. 🤔🤔🤔 Am I the only one who's getting even more irritated by this Bosasa/ANC nonsense??? All that money. This is exactly why the EFF wants to scrap tenders and consulting. Why can't they train and hire their own people? Imagine hiring Bosasa to hire a catering company. The heck. How the heck do you pay a company to install TVs in prison? KFC😂 "He gets car sick ANC people and chicken🤦‍♀ @rohan barnard He's here. I feel it too😂😂😂 The CIC said they whole Luthuli house needs to move closer to courts. @Michael Michael 😂😂😂 Angelo 🤔 Funerals.

At the end of the day he's a human like all of us Agrizzi always made us watch this commission "Hate him But how come Bosasa had so much cash stored in their premises? @Anne M. But the question is how were monies circulating outside banks just like that? @Magda Seguin. I know he spoke about it but am puzzled by how on earth could this be allowed to happen for years? "Jerrrr this thing is deep "Sdumo Dlamini
Phendukani Bethuel,welcome Agrizz
Magda Seguin,Judge Zondo says there are people who do not want the Commission to succeed...wo @Michael mbatha True If anything happen to him all he'll will break loose Fana Hlongwana must be nailed his name crops up ALL the time since the arms deal Anything is possible @Louie... @Ruaan Sails what about the corrupt ANC politicians ? Cash bonus and no tax Watson called it monopoly money @Peter pott it was laundered money...The banks were not involved They laundered the tender money via a bottle store in Roodepoort Equal Trade is the liquor store Zuma visited Bosasa ....his birthdays was paid for by Bosasa he is fully implicated in this rot @Eslon Eslon Agrizzi explained everything about how money was laundered in his first testimony The petrol station was just a drop off point Unless they bribed to have the cameras not working Agrizzi has a load of evidence...Watson is the main culprit in the Bosasa saga The corruption in SA runs deep....it seems 3-5 out of ten citizens were involved in the corrupt dealings "@Eslon Eslon the NPA "@peter pott..RICA or not @Yandi Masina I read that other companies who tendered and lost to Bosasa are litigating the state @Louis Claasen "We want the ANC implicated politicians to be arrested first The thing with Bosasa was that they had a company that was designed to provide any kind of service The Guptas captured ALL the SOE's...it's humongous bringing the country to its knees....don't let anyone fool us that this is bigger...both are horrendous Everyone should watch the Dennis Blown testimony...it is available on YT...he fought against his comrades about the prison contracts but was ridiculed Stop fat shaming people... @goolamv you should know better than to ridicule others Tea break How many cars did Nomvulas daughter crash Don't worry.. Steinhoff story is in progress I hope the link don't crash with thousands online Dudu Myeni is quiet Dudu must tell us about the NPA documents she gave to Watson and the 300k rand in the LV bag She is already on the list...along with others that are impmicated "That is how the ANC Adriana Bass on testified here...he wrote about Bosasa since 2007 and nobody listened *Adriaan Basson The current PP compromise as well SA lacks leadership that is why people turn to fake pastors @Sofia Sofia...yes he gave his testimony yesterday...he is one dodgy individual too @Precious Ntshangase vulnerable and traumatised I hear you @Sofia Sofia Nomvulas said we can pick up the rand if it falls She also said she don't need 'dirty votes' She has total disrespect for the people she is supposed to serve "@Sofia Sofia we have a news NPA head Zuma used the intelligence services for his own ends...it's public knowledge.The report is online. The EFF is also corrupt ...one name connected to Juju is the illegal cigarette smuggler Mazotti.. "As a concerned citizen I wi'll not leave the EFF alone Proof is what the ANC asked for denying and obfuscating...EFF Will also be exposed I know Thapelo but people must stop using this forum to canvas votes for the EFF...it is sickening Exactly Judge Zondo The media is consistently undermined in SA by politicians Attacking journalusts is a popular pastime of the EFF and BLF too...remember tge ANC used the SABC as a mouthpiece Go on twotter and see how the EFF and BLF harras and insult jpurnalists.. Municipalities invested public money in VBS who turned out to be a disaster Julius has moles everywhere...even in the ANC.He knew who the new head of SARS was before the announcement yesterday They are going door to door promising same old to poor vulnerable people who believe them The ANC is only interested in serving the party and not the country I watched the UK house of commons votes on Brexit last night.A total mess.On the live chat people are just as sick and tired in the UK of political shenanigans. Peer Venter said Agrizzi asked him to a meeting and wrote his statement that he signed...he is really dodgy Vote EFF at your peril...they want to go the Venezuela route The EFF has put parliament in disrepute with their hooliganism...even attacking people physically..they create chaos all over the country
Sfiso Nkosi,Morning Everyone..

Nolan Mutota,Get them Grizzy
Nondwe Majiza,welcome back Mr Agrizzi...
MANDLA DLUDLU,Pretorias is very smart. Agrizzi just confirmed that he is giving evidence freely but Agrizzi coerced Venter to testify...... Agrizzi is a smart criminal not a smart guy...... @michael mbatha True Agrizzi is a smart criminal and can be very convincing to the untrained eye that's why I respect Pretorias and the way he has a poker face..... Agrizzi has all the characteristics of a top mafia syndicate leader with the details he has of everything. I'm shocked how people have fallen in love with him without paying attention to his motive.. @Israel Milanzi Obvious..... @Cameron Kim 100% @Cameron Kim Remember what he said earlier in the year. He decided to testify when he almost died..... @Ruaan Sauls 100% @Nelson Musoliwa 100% @peter pott I'm a little worried with the input he had in Venter's affidavit as if to make sure that the other witnesses statements correspond with his...... @makhosi nobhatyi I agree however his motive goes deeper than that especially when Venter spoke about his influence on Venter's affidavit..... @Michael Michael I do not think that is the case. It is a personality issue & also depends on how deep they were into corruption. From the testimonies Agrizzi was just as deeply in it as Watson was. You guys must remember Agrizzi admitted he was a racist therefore he would discourage some of the payments Watson wanted to make...... Agrizzi is someting else man. This was a serious cartel yerrrrr...... @Thabani Mthethwa me too.......😂😂😂 You guys sound like you've been hypnotized how do you know everything Agrizzi is saying is true. Agrizzi said he had nothing to do with Bosasa since 2016 I think but Venter confirmed it's not true... @Thapelo Chuene 😁😁😁😁😁

jeevan singh,His wife knew all along he was involved in corruption and was enjoying the benefits. so she too must be locked by not telling the cops. Cecil. what give a public funds thief respect. million are children starving because of people like him and we must give him respect. come on. Matthew very true. Cecil no disrespect to you but this guy knew the investigations were closing in on Bosasa so he made his move before getting involved. immunity attempt. he has lucifer on him. not Jesus. We want more names. Desmond. just ignore him. Cameron. Ask Trump. tax duck bonus. I want some. ESKOM the biggest state capture in history. wait you ant seen nothing yet. This is like a picnic. BIIIG POLITAL NAMES involved. just now. Where's that pretty Adorable advocate. I know that petrol station. been there. Danny Mazil is in USA petrol station coming from the airport towards Cosmo city its 5 km. sort of hidden. This guy already sold story and film rights to Holliday in USA. Making big bucks. sorry Hollywood. I need election money. heard Dudu Myeni and gang still nominated as parliament representatives by the ANC despite being implicated with Bosasa corruption. I wonder what is going to happen to the ANC voters this election. Will they still vote for them. individuals are the ANC Ayanda. The ANC nominated all corrupted members to parliament to the IEC. why. Agrizzi is really enjoying himself I see. His wife is two times bigger than him. can't fit in the porch. Desmond cake is hidden. can't see it.

Sofia Sofia,Hi All is Agrizzi on all day ? or is this just cross examination ? "EXPLAINED: Bosasa CEO's R500K donation to Ramaphosa's campaign Multiple reports stemming from testimony before the Zondo commission into state capture this week have claimed that R500 000 "was paid by Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson through a front company to the ""Andile Ramaphosa Foundation""." "This testimony by Peet Venter "he was told by Watson this payment into an ABSA account named ""EFG2"" was for the Andile Ramaphosa Foundation." Venter was misled by Watson when he was told the money was for Andile Ramaphosa. "The issue of the payment has been traversed in some detail in the public domain since November 2018 "and News24 dug into the transaction around the same time "Edelstein Farber Grobler News24 at the time also obtained independent verification from sources in the banking sector that this account did in fact belong to the law firm. President Ramaphosa himself confirmed the purpose of the EFG2 account was to house donations to his ANC presidential campaign in 2017. Here is what you need to know about the R500 000 donation to CR17: "Venter states that on October 18 "At the time Miotto's sole director was Margeret Longworth Miotto's registered business address is Longworth's residential address in Krugersdorp. "Venter states he was instructed to pay R500 000 from Miotto into an account named ""EFG2"" at ABSA bank." "The remaining R2.5m was to be used for an alternate purpose (the purchase of a home for Lindie Gouws "Venter attaches an SMS from Watson to himself in which he sends the EFG2 account details to Venter at 08:20 on October 18 @Yandi Masina @Magda Seguin Hi guys .. Yeah its been a while ..with load shedding and all these increases I felt bit despondent watching this crap ... "Watson himself states in the SMS it is an ""attorney's trust account"". Watson makes no mention of the Andile Ramaphosa Foundation in the SMS." Venter further attaches proof of payment which shows an amount of R500 000 paid from Miotto's FNB account to the EFG2 account. I just feel this state capture is pointless if nothing is happening with all these thieves ! @Yandi Masina @Magda Seguin @rohan barnard

The state has employees from all walks of life @Talent P Sibisi Police are state employees State prosecutors are state employees @Frik Brits That is a fact all over the world. Independence does not mean not being a state employee. @Frik Brits The police were threatening to go on strike recently and they negotiated with the state. Soldiers are state employees @Cameron Kim Deal with your employer @Cameron Kim 😁😁😁 @Cameron Kim Get me one too. @makhosi nobhatyi Molo qabane How is Patrick Gilingham linked to the ANC? "@Marvel Ramatshela Yes Agrizzi metioned all the names last time. He is only giving further explanation on that evidence @Funani Manzi i ANC yethu is the best @Michael Michael Not all state employees are linked to the ANC. That is public management 101 @Cameron Kim I dont get you? The state does not belong to a governing party. The new SARS commissioner Edward Kieswetter will be working for the state. Does that make him ANC? @Michael Michael Thanks for understanding "'The battle for the cleansing of the ANC has begun' ANC veterans and stalwarts have called on South Africans to vote for the governing party in the upcoming elections saying that no other party has what it takes to lead the country. """We still believe no other party in this country has the solutions "Zikalala said that """We urge them to step aside if their nomination may be negatively perceived by the electorate and if in any way The named individuals must account. The ANC has about a Million members The ANC conference in 2017 spelt out the kind of leaders the ANC wanted to see serving the party.
