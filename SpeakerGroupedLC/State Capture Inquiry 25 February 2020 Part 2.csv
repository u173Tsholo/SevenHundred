Margareth Waterboer,This man must honestly be reigned in...He must adhere to the question-answer code of the commission "Yes
Rob Nel,Zondo is putting a question to him now A very long question "I have seen witnesses that avoid answering questions. Now we have a guy whom obviously has nothing to hide
Solutions SA,lecture of note
Peet Venter,No sooner he's invited to discuss he then crumbles under party peer pressure. Carrim needs to answer about the upgrades and CCTV installations at his house by Bossasa's Agrizzi My humble apologies. It was Vincent Smith who benefited from Bossasa. I misplaced the two.
Jacky Buster,I'm listening to the witness on the stand. he is lecturing us not testifying. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜„
bongile sango,@Mj I agreed with you this is a lecture
luzuko masoka,i see no one this guy is talking to who where is evident leader
Eugene,I love this guys hair style
Khumza M,"government is wasting money
Somebody's Thunder,answer the question man flip
Samuel Nembidzane,how long will this commission last and no arrest made wasting money and time
Immanuel,is mr carrim the guest speaker here. he is doing most of the talking without being led it seems he is a liberty to workshop this commission as he is speaking for hours on end. i blame the evidence leader. u cant give a witness leeway to taaaaaalk and taaaaalk and equivocated "@nkanyezi i will ask him to pay a handsome lobola to me first before i can hook you up yunus carrim early adjournments waste of tax payers money. no more extensions will be granted for this commission
Cerebis,What is this guy giving evidence about? It seems like a boring lecture?
makhosi nobhatyi,He knows his work and explain clearly
Chetty Home,Peer Venter ...cctv installlations at carrims home ~ do you have evidence ......? Thank you Sir ~ appreciate your retraction.
Naledzani Mashau,Arrests are emminent First all these thugs need to be stripped off their Powers (Clipped off their Wings)before taking them to Prison.Dudu Myeni is one Example.
noordster1,He covers the questions that Zondo needs answered as Zondo said earlier. Also...give him enough rope and he may hang himself. His willingness to talk so much will get him into trouble @ Mr Mpho: you cannot arrest anyone If the commission is in progress
Lethabo Maesela,jacon ''butternut'' zuma was captured by WMC as well. what a historical mistake
Very Berry's,please send
Mr Mpho,I used to think this commission is worth every penny now I joint those saying it was and still a waste of state funds commission has been granted extension until next year March no more extensions the extension will take the bill to a billion namasent expensive for nothing not a single soul arrested
Woken- N-blessed,Did this one said society that is none racial? thieves. WHO are running SA by the way?
Nkanyezi Nadine,I like this guy. @Immanuel ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ he speaks proper english.
Mtokozisi Baleni,"Am just tired of hearing this name Gupta's.
Thabo Maake,Very lively and energetic. He's clued up because he's an extensive reader. I've always admired his chairing of the Finance Committee in Parliament. Holds ministers accountable all the time.
Bethuel Maabane,i said it before to my friends multi choice is over charging us
Legae Nyalungu,if digress was a personðŸ˜ƒ
Nomonde Dr Nolutshungu,Legae Nyalungu ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
