Bheki Tembe,Sibalukhulu
Niek Cape Town,"Ousman proof Ousman!!!!! Ahhh. Trump knows everything huh? Trump even is an inventor. He created a new country named NAMBIA Trump is the most idiotic president the USA has ever had. EFF is just a puppet of the Zuma faction of the ANC I can mix whoever Iwant "Ousman Who cares wat jewelry she is wearing EFF IS A PUPPET OF ZUMA'S ANC FACTION WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE TO BE BITTEN BY THE DOG OR CAT "I LOVE THE AUTOMATIC TRANSLATOR USED: ALIBABA MUSIC VIDEOS AUTOMATIC TRANSLATOR......READ BEFORE YOU ANSWER oBAMA LOL
Kevin Simon,"Ousman Njie...........more vigilant and not be complacent For airtime to get this mention shows it is a significant cost incurred to communicate with the PP who didn't appreciate their challenge to even call her.! People were seriously let down in this matter. Gordhan represents a risk to the continued malfeasance by connected EEF acolytes This was the Hawks during Bernings time. Get him here. Now! Subpoena the Hawks... First one. "Guys muwanga soul roy ​@Mbuso Ndlovu YOU MEAN ORANGES ARE FREE IN ORANGE FREE STATE. HOW DO ORANGE FARMERS BENEFIT FROM GIVING THEM FOR FREE: Go read your history!!!!
Nonzy,"Its quite hard to separate fact from emotion. His testimony makes my head hurt the guy behind advocate is hot. Lindiwe is very cheeky. Now I understand why he is so emotional "I've just looked at Msebenzi Zwane's picture What kind of Zulu is this guy speaking?

Thanks guys "More political education and opinions. It doesn't stop "No
Rakatsinyane Tsolo,"This PP is a flop "REC to loot state money
Born free,Freida. Is this witness one of the Farmers who should have benefited from the Estina project? Yip.. beware of the EFF This project was meant to help 80 farmers. What another shame. Zuma can only doodle Is that her third eye on the Translators Forehead?? True story Jabu We have an EFF patriot on this chat. Mazotti is Malema's china. Malena rents his house. Gordhan did nothing illegal "Gordhans Intelligence Unit raided Mazotti residence and business he is a tax evader and owes SARS R34. 95 million. Mazotti is Malema I think NOT The EFF will be knocked off one by one. The Judge will make a ruling on Monday about Gordhan. Scorpions were the best but Zuma got rid of them and put all his corrupt comrades in the Hawks. Then they tried to frame Colonel Booysen and one other. Jabu must be an EFF supporter.. can always tell. PP is also protected by the EFF thugs This man was an employee at Estina farm Sorry Benificiary Dangerous to whom?? WOW SURE IS A GANGSTER STATE.

We dnt any proof "Dream on  U will be sleeping on top on the roof from today bcs we dnt know the involvement of police and the hawks in this matter I just feel for this guy after today he should consider buying a cap and sun glasses to b nt recognized. Unless they target his family "U will be killed by the same protection u r to be given "U dont even need millions to have saps members to u camp "politician have their ways to get u nomatter u r protected by soldiers or nt "All the guys mentioned r smart  Ace is untouchable "Zondo which police r u referring to "Lets hope all the people mentioned will face the full hand of the law "The guy is Zuli ZULU "Politicians dnt give u a day b4 u get killed "i dnt trust this witness

"EFF fighting for convicts who fund them Floyd Shivambu was dining with Rupert.. lol.. Mkwebane is handled by guptas. she accepted the briefcase so now she has to tow d line "Yes "what is Gordon guilty off? getin tax dodgers to pay up.. what else? did he steal u r racist Gordon tried to get monies from tax dodgers lik mazoti. that is his only crime They taught CR will dismiss Gordon so they can continue stealing get the eff out of here..hahahahaha "Gordon has put a stop to a lot of corrupt deals at saa "I ask again lol. so u don't no then ama Fikile He gave Ivan Pillay early retirement and rehired him few years later.. is that his crime? "He went after tax dodgers "Fikile "Did he hav estina dairy deals "Carnoth has a court found Gordon guilty? "if so The PP is corrupt. she finding against Gordon is to suit the zuma faction narrative. Now let the court test her again "Carnoth "Aphiwe pravin being persecuted for early retirement to Pillay and for goin after tax fraudsters... hahahhaha "pravin is a big crime lord hey PP is being handled by the zuma faction.. "Carnoth "Carnoth "Is so "By the way "That's fine "so Carnoth "and by the way wena Carnoth "I ask u again wena Carnoth "Com Carnoth "Carnoth The pp report is a joke and a clear hit on Gordon to try and make him leave that lucrative post of puplic enterpirses minister They are findings..her own biased finding which must be challenged in court just lik the court said she lied few days ago. "The Court found the mkwebane lied and mislead Mkwebane hides behind the Office of the PP to do all her wrong things "people mus think for themselves and don't listen to charlotins lik malema..malema was at dbn july dressed up in R150000 cloths after the dbn july he was drunk at 1am and told ppl to go home and have sex..hahahhahah..malema wena leader "Carnoth "Mkwebane is handled by zuma faction..she uses the smaller judgement to say  "Carnoth "Why is she so desperate for Cyril to implement her remedial actions? Its like she does not understand that Gordon has a right to appeal in court just lik u and me am I missing somtin? but who died and made eff government? they should remain in ter corner and ppl whould not be concerned with them "Eff is not a court of law. In fact The estina dairy report was invalidated by a court Mkwebane protects zuma faction. dhe finds against Gordon on petty issues without evidence but does not even mention Ace in estina report..hahhahah Its clear from her reports that the PP is handled by zuma/gupta faction. find against our enemies and don't find against our corrupt friends Mkwebane is soon to be struck off the roll of advocates constitutional court found against mkwebane. why is she stil ter? she is defying the highest court just lik parliament did in favour of zuma "Lungisani "High court rules PP report on Vrede was unconstitutional.. lugisani facts are your friend.. stop listening to nonsense from malema n ace Ace will com up with som memory loss lik zuma "Ace deny deny retract retract..order..please leave d house ubaba myeni dudu "Lungisani That North west former premier is also noted for renting crowds "Let Ace just say Mr Dlamini is lying "zuma has protection. this man has no protection Eff anti corruption?

He said that once the ANC says that we fought for freedom Mandela was a leader. any issue was resolved through debate. But now we hav corruption which cannot be resolved through debate.. Proteas cricket team r captured bafana is captured "all our sports are captured by ppl who are on top for decades..the likes of danny jordaan this commission should also investigate the corruption in sport. remember sedgars? send fikile mbalula to Dubai then sedgars got a tender to supply all our sports bodies supersport monopoly on pay tv and sport in SA should be investigated..remember sabc under Hlaudi sold their rights to dstv in a corrupt deal and dstv brought in a tv channel called ann7 Talk to EFF about VBS? did they arrest and recover monies from VBS directors? whats takin soo long?? did they recover monies from the Mpisanes in kzn? mpisanes wer in bed with zandile gumede n co "Muwanga "im not any tribe.

This guy need serious protection Just think that Ace pushed for Zwane to be a chair of a Parliament committee? I wonder how he will perform under cross examination "Mkwebane shouldn't only be struck off the advocates roll What will eff and those idiots say hands PP say now? Mkwebane has shown that she's not a public protector but a politician protector occupying public protector's office. who would agree with me?

Dominic Przybylski,EFF and DA are trying to split ANC so that Magashule faction joins EFF and Ramaposa faction joins DA. @Buyiswa Mnyani It's very clear to me. Whether they succeed who knows? @Buyiswa Mnyani Spot on. @Greg Rowles The state is collapsing. Gangs are taking over the metros. There soon won't be enough money to pay grants to 17 million who rely on them to stay alive. Then what do you think will happen? @Greg Rowles Faith without a plan gets us nowhere. @Greg Rowles We don't have leadership. We have 'collective responsibility'. "We need minimal government EFF policy removes all motivation for people to work and succeed. Everybody will get same no matter if they work or do nothing. How can economy survive with that kind of policy? ANC NEC seems to be mafia. EFF are clowns. Their leaders wear overalls but have never worked in a job where they need to wear overalls. @antony ndapuka If eff is solution then please tell me what the problem is that they solve. @Masewawatla Masewawatlasethe Supporters of EFF and ANC prove that they like corruption. @Yin Yang Please don't insult anarchists. Look up anarchist in dictionary. They are people who want minimal interference from government. EFF is opposite of anarchist. @Thando Nkutha In what context? Internet is proof that anarchy works. """Anarchism is an anti-authoritarian political philosophy that rejects hierarchies deemed unjust and ...""" """advocates their replacement with self-managed "@Yin Yang The definition you use is one which the establishment which feels threatened by it uses. It is outdated. Nowdays ""anarchism"" is almost synonomous with libertarianism." Limpopo went bust under Malema. Here we interact as individuals. Each of us is different even if we have same colour skin. Race classification now is just as simplistic and bad as it was under apartheid. "EFF policy is wide open to abuse and corruption "What's wrong with these witnesses? Why are they not saying ""I don't remember"" @Wilson M She did interview them according to last witness but it seems she didn't quote/use their evidence. When is ms Meyer going to testify? I think interpreter has started new jewelry fashion. Guptas love ANC. They would still be poor immigrants if it wasn't for ANC. Whole world was hoping that Nelson Mandela's government would be the start of an African rennaisance where the continent would finally become succesfull. This is tragedy for whole continent. Will be less and less land for people if our population doubles every 10 years. @Musa Bakiti Interesting. Why such a similar word for meat and black?
Lorna Kavanagh,This poor fellow having to watch everyone he comes into contact with in case they kill him. So many people have had their lives threatened ... But in the case of Zuma i don't believe his life is in danger. The killing goes on and on ...... this is serious Man this is serious .. I feel so sorry for this man. ...so sad to hear this man's story about the dairy project. Thr government must sit up and listen to his story. very sad indeed. Ace was premier during this time They didn't realise that the government they had voted for would let them down so badly .. Malema certainly lives very well. No worker lifestyle for him. I wouldn't be surprised if PP is part of state capture.

I think she has played her final cards though.... the pressure will increase to have dis barred and then she has fired herself from the office of the PP @goolamv I hope the EFF are going t help her fund her R900k legal costs bill Not only did she not interview the crooks..... she also never interviewed any of the intended beneficiaries either..... BEFORE she issued her report.... typical from Mkwebane . They stole R280 million in this scam Mr Dhlamini needs a special mention in Parliament

"EFF leaders are full of hypocrisy "Floyd and Malema are just memes "EFF leaders are Hippocrates EFF is not the answer for colonialism their leaders are being funded by the same oppressors they pretend to be fighting. EFF is funded by Italian mafia and rupert. Anyone who takes EFF serious is not serious about life itself. EFF Malema has allinated himself with Dali Mpofu as a result he is losing all the cases and yet to go to jail. Dali Mpofu is leaving EFF soon. Dali Mpofu and Malema dont see eye to eye anymore. Malema has been jailed before so whats going to stop that from happening when found guilty of offence. Malema Critisized Dali Mpoli in public and Mpofu didnt Like it. He doestn advice EFF legally anymore. Mpofu Is no longer available to Advice EFF legally "EFF is soon going down "Malema said if someone wants to go they can go Ramaphosa must be given a chance to fully clear his name to move forward into revealing all other Corrupt rats like Malema and his cronnies. Malema has a corrupt record already in the ANC. Malema was found to have appropriated himself with the Ratanang trust money Malema is being funded secretly by coloniasm. Malema built a 16 million rand house with a R26 000 salary of the ANC youth president. Malema protects the PP so they dont get investigated for VBS fraud.
