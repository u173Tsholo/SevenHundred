Yolo More,Its lit on ENCA. SABC is useless "But new age is new But all this rubbish is not helping him. He thinks he is smart. Manyi must come back. He is deliberately buying time talking nonsense so that by 14:15 he is released. Shifting blame. Felix Muyoba he is a qualified liar. Yes most of ATM leaders are apostles. "Pastor J Prophets are those who their ears are next to God's mouth Pastor J. "Pastor J Once Ramaphosa became President Manyi smelt unemployment thatswhy he ran away to ATM to withdraw money from congregants. Manyi is fumbling as usual. He said he is on a hurry now he is wasting time.

Mazwi Comfort,what to do with State Capture? Kruger this is becoming a joke
Kay Kay,Zondo is leaning more on Manyi "@Buyani Mhlongo "@Elliot Chauke "@Elliot Chauke He's being sacarcist to indimindate the evidence. Chair is bias today and only protecting Manyi than his evidence leader "@Elliot Chauke he's contradicting himself now Ms Hofmeyer is giving Manyi his own words to hang himself with circulation and Readership is two different aspects Is Mr Manyi still in ATM party leadership? He's justification of TNA is evasive He's evasive Manyi is running away from the topic or questions
Pastor J.J,SKELM Oh No @Eliot Chauke ...Why do you say something like that? @Spykerhond Hahahahahahahh. u are so right @He lives in you ...Thats a brilliant line. Well said. @Ewald Kruger ...I have just realised that both you and I are trying to make sense and conversing to 2 Royal Idiots and a few Professional fools. Perhaps we should let them go. @He lives in you ...I have also realised that Elliot is not blinded by the condition of his eyes but by the extent of his foolishness @Spykerhond .Vote for me as the next President and I will drop Vat to 2%. Thats the ki @Spykerhond ...hahahahahaha. I think you know what I meant. But it is the kind of nonsense that Politicians feed voters. @Thando Nkutha ...Who bro? I have my Doom in hand @Thando Nkutha Tried Spraying the Doom. Not strong enough for some cockroaches unfortunately. Try your broom bro u @Eliot Chauke ...Our views and opinions may differ but I like love you my brother. @Eliot Chauke . My brother. The case in point here is simple. A dog only barks at a moving bus. @Thando Nkutha ...I am not sure what you did to her but she seems very upset today. Reminds me of my last 40 years. "When a Fool as run out of foolish things to say @Born free You are right friend. But I wanted to engage with sensibility so I chose to direct my comments to Mikes response instead. "Okay. I have now figured it all out. Elliot is Jimmy Manyi""s sister in disguise." @Lungisani Mabaso hahahahahahahaha I should be questioning this Jimmy Laaitie. No words will be spoken. I will just sommer klap the truth out of him @Lungisani Mabaso . Never. Mmusi Maimane is. Thank the Lord I retired already if he is. @Yolo More . I have asked the question a million times. How does one go about being Apostles and Prophets etc.? I couldnt get an acceptable answer. Mostly no answer @Yolo More I believe you may have just given the 1st plausible answer. "@Yolo More The question still is how do they become such? What training @Yolo More . You could and I suspect be spot on. @Zukile Mawisa ...Sadly you are so right my child. I pray that things will change for you soon.
Rob Nel,Guy has got an attitude Selective memory #tina do whites own ramaphosa's farm?
Immanuel,"this chap seems to consider himself a genius arrogant neh?🙄 manyi is now playing advocate🤣🤣
Khaya Menziwa,"Anyone who makes him sweat and doesn't get intimidated by him "Adv. Hoffmeyer is in trouble of receiving worse attitude from this guy
Decstar,Morning @He lives in you
Mpho Kgofelo,"very true Khanya " "Manyi is trying adopt Zuma's style ""I don't recall"" today he is different from the first appearence. that day he was acting clever."
Jon February,This is the only problem I have with Judge Zondo. He must stop leading people. This guy must account and not get led to ways out or giving stories that does not make sense at all.
Zakhe Mabaso,cry the beloved country...
Phura Lings,"""he was my employer after all""hahahahahaah"
Eliot Chauke,Hofmeyer is behaving like a bribed journalist who's pushing agenda @Kay Kay Manyi say he was not fired and his proof is that he was receiving salary... The White Lady is saying he was fired but not giving evidence to back her up . Agenda @khumalo whats there to investigate? she received his bank statement... wat other proof do u need Hofmeyer failed. she spent time on irrelevant things. @Kruget 🤣🤣🤣🤣 She spent time on the letter that has no legal basis🤣🤣🤣 Manyi is not lying. Manyi is doing very well The commission has spent R400million... and still counting. nobody has been brought to book. Manyi cost to the commission is drop in the Ocean @Pastor are you for real?😂 Zondo once said he meet with cyril Ramaphosa regularly... Im not surprised why Transformation Champions are always ABUSED when appearing before this commission @Boshiolo can u be specific please @Kay Kay Hofmeyer is pushing an Agenda. open your eyes @Kay Kay Hofmeyer is busy with the Stratcom led smear campaign on Transformation Champions because i hve a different view? @Thando whats your problem "Hofmeyer is wasting our Tax money. every time she open her mouth @Thando hi wena ntsena u nga pfumeleriwa ku commenta? u hluriwa hi yini ku amukela kuri a hi nge vi na mavonelo yo fana? @Mbambeni stop embarrassing yourself @Donovan No "@Donovan Peters R400million has been spent @Thando i hve no clue about what? that she's pushing an agenda? Mr Joe Khosa you be the judge... Hofmeyer is starting a debate she's not gonna win 96% dont matter!!!! thats the agenda we talking about Government employees miss TNA @Khumalo. thats the whole truth. Like hoffmeyer said shes not interested in 96% of GCIS spending... but 4%. Zuma didnt loot Zuma didnt loot Dont fall for Stratcom agenda on Zuma... Zuma is clean Manyi is making life difficult for Hofmeyer Jamnandas will ne criss examined by Dali Mpofu... @Mabaso u saw how many times hifmeyer couldnt proceed wth her intended line of questioning? i thought RWC victory united the Nation... im shocked to see how Manyi is treated You guys are Full of Hate im for Unity if we could forgive and 'forget' about apartheid... why cant we do the same with the so called state capture "State Capture didnt kill anyone. Apartheid killed many people. For apartheid "Stop State Capture... you have a Captured President @Mabaso nobody asked for forgiveness from the minorities but Mandela said 'we forgive u' Cyril Ramaphosa is busy with state capture... all those who paid for CR17 are benefitting. y'all are quiet about that... @Mabaso our Grannies were killed by apartheid. money is nothing cant be compaired to life CR17 funders are getting government and Soe deals.... the cr17 was private however benefits come from government coffers Apartheid is crime against humanity... State capture is not😂 @Donovan my Granny should have been alive if it wasnt for Apartheid murderers yet you support Apartheid Hofmeyer failed. could not finish hahahah You guys have been great✌🏿✌🏿
Ince SilentNoise,@Ewald Kruger Behave Boi.... @Ewald Kruger AGAIN Behave Boi
Fun Fact,He's a Smooth Criminal ANC Terrorists Afrikaner Resistance👍 Afrikaans for South Africa MSAGA
Charles Nkadimeng,lol
digitalemotionfilms,Soooooo Our Former president lost his right to appeal
Pheladi Lamola,With our incompetent government it is possible to receive salary after being fired. Why is he laughing now? And indirect answer? Ms Hoffmeyer is right. I used to get that paper in Telkom but I never read it. I don't know why though. Compare it to Daily sun then Jimmy Yes Mam. Got him 😂😂 Jimmy going to Mpumalanga from Polokwane and decides to go via North West and Gauteng🙈 Now he's washing his hands During Maseko's tenure GCIS was functioning the same way but they refused to facilitate the Gupta foraging. Why did Jimmy allow it
SA PANDA,what's the purpose of this commission? the main reason why this commission was formed? because it seems like like there are no results. "Zuma will be sick next week
THABANG ARCADIA,Government does pay you your salary after you have rendered your resignation doesn’t stop immediately on the month of termination and Manyi is aware of that Remember jimmy Manyi harbored interests of being a “media mogul” this subject is very close to his heart 🤣😂😂😂😂🤣
Innocent Dlamini,Wow
Born free,Skip the tea and lunch so you can finish. He was not getting his salary it had to be back paid. I never subscribed but used to get free TNA papers in my postbox TNA went straight from my postbox into the recycle bin. There are Ghosts in Nkandla no-one wants to buy Nkandla 😱 There target market was certainly targeted at the wrong market.. recycle bin. There agenda was put through a shredder and recycled. The commission would be able to govern this country after all is wrapped up. A very biased NewAge designed to provide its readers with a false narrative that the ANC government is governing so well. 😂😂😂😂do you dispute this? That's your favorite question Someone needs the loo Tina... your thinking is as bad as your writing. Tina has a simple mind "Tina is a twit @Pastor J..your remarks should be directed at Tina "like Catch the enablers that enabled State Capture and taxpayers hard earned money. There were no subscribers so 96% of taxpayers money was used in this scam. TNA was a scam to loot taxpayers money
Mzalwane Mzala,Former President Zuma just lost a bid to appeal the Hannekom judgement.

Thabo Mohale,hi
Paul molane,lol
Donovan Peters,Eliot Chauke -Are you a journalist. Jimmy with a slight shiffer in his voice-1st time he said there is no evidence ppl are just speaking of hear say. Eliot Chauke-They are now shivering like Jimmy. They need to search the bunker in Nkandla where all covert operations are run from to derail S.A. I'd buy Nkandla jus for all those treasures. No Probibilities here Facts being checked against what was being said. Sthakathi Khumalo -The guy that debunked WMC by Bell Pottinger soon to testify.Bell Pottinger apologised to S.A. Sthakathi Khumalo -The boss tells everybody what to do whether you like it or not.Especially when you are not educated. MIKE DURBAN-What to you think the bunker at Nkandla was for. Eliot Chauke -Bell Pottinger already debunked. I love his arrogance while swimming in the fire pool on twitter. Skhumbuzo Nkosi -Any government paper is PROPAGANDA. Skhumbuzo Nkosi -One that is independent. Eliot Chauke -Always going to race to muddy the waters instead of dealing with issues at hand. Eliot Chauke -That is private money Zuma stole Public Funds.Old age ppl we be receiving at R3000 rand grants by now if not for corruption. Eliot Chauke -Our parents should be receiving R3000 pension payouts and yet you stand up for Askari's. Eliot Chauke -PPL still drinking with animals from rivers in this day age is a crime against humanity. Don't fool yourself with the unfounded apartheid nostalgia you seem to be experiencing.
Heather Mbambeni,Eliot Chauke how is she wasting the tax money?are you even paying tax? Eliot Chauke you are the one embarrassing yourself

Zamankwali Ngema,But this 👦
Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,this advocate is not disturbed at all by Manyi's obvious disdain and sometimes attempts at belittling her.
Mthobisi Zuma,have they changed the venue?
T the X,we made a mistake when we believed the Guptas where the problem. we took our eye off the while people- the real thieves I think Zuma interrupted the real state capture which was comfortably going on since the anglo-boer war ended we are focused on the 4%? who got the 96% please 😂😂 GCIS what what! while white people own all the land.
Ms Cee,🤣🤣😝
Mashao Mohale,Manyi admit you are cornered on this one Graphics and text and readability. Cooked lies "Our economy is on the brink of collapse as result of state capture etc. and we will not put up with anybody for that. People are losing jobs

Needs help "He's learned from his master - Zuma shifting blame!!!! "no Felix @david jacobs i like that. @Lungisani Mabaso yoooh! I wouldn't go to his churc @Zukile Mawisa -illusions of grandeur "@Eliot Chauke State Capture is cruel agree Hofmeyer is getting exasperated by talking to a wall
