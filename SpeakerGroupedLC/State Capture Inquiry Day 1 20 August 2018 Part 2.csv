T.S Mokoena,state capture has really drained this country financially. The youth feeling it more. There is a youth protest looming on social media on Youth unemployment. peoples eyes are open now. Come 2019 But it's not doing right by the Youth with the current state of events in the country anything is possible. over 1000 unemployed youth are voicing their concerns on social media how much is this commission costing us? @stanley if they are grouping to better youth employment in the country I will gladly stand with them. Corruption of our black brothers has made unemployment stats sky rocket üòÅ ul go to jail I think it's a legal firm. Mcedisi Ndlovu don't remember what the S stand for sedumedi
Pastoolio Poggempoel,and still they will vote for the anc the youth It's my opinion And after 2019 it will be fact "@Mpho Mashigo You are right @MIKE LOCK I doubt that. The ANC will throw a few people under the buss but Numba Wun will not see the inside of a jail cell anytime soon. And food parcels into votes heahehaea that's funny @Mpho Mashigo and so is Mugabe hey?
Patrick Esau,puppetry in motion

General Ace is not going anywhere there you are dividing the Anc... White people are using this commission to regroup watch out guys... They are busy on training now... Wanted to diffent their land..

thabani dhliwayo,those who think JZ will be prosecuted they are day dreaming.whites want to see black people being prosecuted and sent to jail are white people clean how many companies do business with government what about evergreen contracts given to white owned companies is this not state capture
thando cezula,We have an independent judiciary! I'm black and I want to see Zuma prosecuted!
Thabiso Molefe,Its not about the colour but justice I wish I could belief you @mpho Mashigo @Mpho Mashigo tables do indeed turn most of the times @stanley for what? some are going to Jail because they know to people to believe on them they must present something near legit. so some will be sacrificed and go to jail for Zuma to survive Shabir was sacrificed thats how it works @mandla yeah!!!! @Mike Yeah sure
Mzalwane Mzala,Hola Advocate Norman. How can this commission be a factional tool against Zuma when he himself has proclaimed it? @Thiza William You are correct @Stanley Gumza We still have not heard people who say Ruppert promised them cabinet positions.
My music,"it seems
Robert Russell,"In general... our back communities get more services provided by the state then do white communities... therefore it beggars the question.... WHO did Zuma Thiza... Zuma was always the Commander in THIEF....even from the early 70's
Thiza William,know history Zuma was never MK Commander in Chief if you dont know what Zuma did wrong definitely you're staying in coocko land where lies are converted into truth and water into wine only two commander in chief existed in life of MK Mandela as the first and OR Tambo as the second. MK was disbanded in 1993 before Zuma became a President of the ANC You don't even know history Zuma is going down..
