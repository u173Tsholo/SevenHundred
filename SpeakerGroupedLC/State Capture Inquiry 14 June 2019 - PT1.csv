Wildthing,Ace and the mafia. yes. but think it's good people from all areas that stood up against the thieves that pushed racism to divert all the things they where doing. turning people against one and other. now we see truth. it's a very big learning curve but it has a very big bill attached it's the once that did not take part on filling up there pockets. The words we should all use. We the South African citizens. it's our duty to do right.
