Sipho,Fake Mentor
Amanda Watson,@Gray Muteweye Maybe not lying but a strong imagination
Paul Nogueira,COPE is the default vote for South Africans tired of this dishonesty - across the political spectrum! Sentence by sentence? about 9 years ago? Desperate attempts to undermine her testimony. Mentor is telling the truth! She is very uncomfortable because what she is going to say is going to benefit the Guptas ... Bewildered chicken because she's being grilled @Tappies Smit "They're gonna challenge Mentor's version after changing things BEFORE the inspection. Like Gwede saying ""Look This proves nothing - who remembers how many stairs there are??? maybe the pillars she saw were in the bedroom ... I think this witness took the pille before testifying ... So someone stole the pillows?
big feet,Ms Buthelezi looking lovely...she used the recess yesterday to do her hair
Tappies Smit,"If Agrizzi goes to jail  Nicely said Cameron...he is a snake!! üòÇüòÇ Is there anyone in the ANC who is not corrupt?? Any names in ANC who is not corrupt..can't think of a single person.... Why is this woman's name not on the screen?? she looks like a bewildered chicken. After Agrizzi's arrest the whistle blowers are very scared of the ANC caders with links to very dangerous people.
Vusumzi Ngcoza,we are online pretorious waxoka

Abraham Varghese,Cross examination wants to prove there were no corruptions took place during Zuma's tenure. Parliament is making kangaroo courts. Why parliament ( politicians ) appoints commission of inquiries? Let the Supreme court of the land should do the job. All appointments in the department are politically done. That is what happened with Medupi and Kusile too. Even the engineers couldn't design and build the power stations according to the standard. Even they couldn't google it to find out the design of a coal plant. "This commission of inquiry will continue until next year. Another game plan "sofia sofia: When Vytjile mentor visited the Saxon wold house long time back "Who knows
Hein de Wit,She is very nervous - not great to sit on these things "@Cameron Kim - maybe some of the ""green stuff"". üòÉ" These are the experts who went and looked at the Gupta compound RELAX ! Just do it ! @Cameron Kim - Lets just hope they know what they are doing. She is very Afrikaans . She is very nervous - and I feel for her. @Cameron Kim - Actually it is a reason - not an excuse. Not everyone enjoys shouting from the rooftops. She is also in awe of her surroundings. Not used to being in the spotlight. So lets cut her slac She is here to confirm/deny Vytjie testimony about the visit to the Gupta house

Mzalwane Mzala,There were 9 by-elections yesterday. The ANC contested to defend 7 of its wards in Kimberley. It retained 6 and lost one to an independent who is a former councillor So in Kimberley the ANC scored 85.7%. You can not hate the people for making their choice @Muhle April These people lie here and say the ANC is dead. @Myka'Al Daud I can tell you that in allthose wards the EFF did not even come second @Felix Muyoba Don't waste your time with people who do not vote ANC. @Sendo Sityebi You guys make a lot of noise about a dead ANC. It is proven to be your wishes. I can move to the Western Cape "In ward 9 in Kimberly ANC 1 @Moira T Your DA got 44 votes In Knysna in the Western Cape the ANC took a ward from an Independent yesterday. The majority trusts the ANC So Ms Mentor was right on this one. I agree @Felix Muyoba @Cameron Kim is obsessed with the ANC
Tobo Lwandile,I'm blocking this A D
Gilbert Lawrence,How can some claim to be professional and yet seem so shaky when testifying. Like watching paint dry. This witness.
Gaone Molefe,She seem incompetent but I dont trust her... "I mean the advocate seems incompetent
Kgothatso Choshi,she is in hot waters can't even speak
Flomenthia Ngcobo,whats wrong with AD NOW AND CAN SHE SPEAK UP PLEASE SO mentor lied basically mara Mentorü§î lol clearly @douglas gwambe exactly! this is about to get interesting we have serious corruption going on AD and you want us to be concerned about MOVIES!
thembeka shibe,I'm sorry but I'm kinda sleepy
Eleanor Diplock,Surely there are more important matters to discuss & probe!!?? Why is this nonsense relevant to be questioned here? All the information is contained in the written affidavit!! Waste of time & money!!
nhlanhla zwane,Mentor was not sure about the house but could remember features... strangeüôÑ I don't think Mentor went to Guptas house but was briefed by those who coached her to lie Who ever coached Mentor about Guptas house misled her because clearly it shows she has never been there
Leonard R. A. Davids,"What a combination Confusing evidence leader Expert witness my foot I know Afrikaans people with alot more confidence "As for the ""expert"" witness eish no wonder public works can call a swimming pool a fire pool. How do you do an investigation on any infrastructure without any official building plans?" As part of the investigation did they have access to any of the other properties in the compound? So why waste our time with all this nonsensical evidence all morning? What a waste of time all morning. But then again i can now understand her lack of confidence
Zolani Mnqika,yes now this is what i call transparence
Myka'Al Daud,Well done ANC lets hope they manage 50% come 8th of May I am not involved in N.Cape politics but where we are we are happy with our growth "We eat the elephant bit by bit Remember ANC failed to get 50% in majority of cities and they went to power bcos of small parties like in Rustenburg and Ekurhuleni Most of the youth in those areas have left bcos of unemployment and ANC will collect old pensioners to come and vote 4 them. wait 8th May is coming The Stellenbosch mafias r celebrating ANC victory in N.Cape
Sibusiso Maswanganyi,"Her vocabulary is so weak @Welton finished üòÇ @Grayboy what does that have to do with being articulate?
Briony French,who notices this stuff. only an architect will notice this. because eff was apart of anc and racking in the money. also have you noticed cash in transet heist slowed down once the anc guy was caught. i think all the heists were the anc for bossasa to pay them bossasa had access to full security gear cant trust any politicians "@cameron kim most councils dont even have plans thats why its not law when you sell your house to produce plans. yup Agrezzi and Gordhan im interested to hear Robert McBride hlaudi must come and testify and confirm like he did in the papers that Bosasa gave him 1.1milliom for legal fees to fight his case. that will confirm Agrezzi is telling truths mentor was boring and the one fat afrikaans oak. they both are terrible in english and should maybe have been allowed to testify in their home languages @sofia sofia yes stage 2 "it will be too little too late "everyone lies tea break mike the only hope i see for this country is the dagga party. atleast they have a plan look at where america has made it legal and how well they doing we need that "fru maybe it was a stripper pole and not a pillar @Cameron kim yes... just wish everyone would drive better. exactly not all pillars are load bears bearing its called money honey they could have covered it up.... yes dr lol @welton. its bad "they giving free darkness maybe they took her to another house? "why question so much to store their millions so they can dive into money most people are right now with the corruption so she was at the wrong house
Ali Tebele,with due respect wake me when she is done... she is so slow
Portia Diale,@Ali Tebele I actually got lost along the way as well
MIKE DURBAN,The Gupta's most probably did alterations to the houses...knowing that an inspection would be done some time in the future.....remember they are capable of doing anything.... Easy to bribe the building inspectors.......think about it... I reckon DA is the lessor of all the evils... Mmmm...lessor I reckon.... Check the aerial photo's for each year....if available This witness is wearing a Commie tunic ...Mmmmm And she is supposed to be an architect.. This whole thing seems a bit shady..... but she is wearing a Commie uniform..... Sorry...Gupta uniform..heheh Geees...it could be the wrong building in the compound But don't the DPW only deal with Gov buildings...not private buildings... Thank the Lord... Eeesh...that means the Marines are coming..... now this bis a professional advocate....
