TKON SMITH,morning
TG Swartlane,Accomplice @Ibo are you noticing the movement? Please elaborate your previous question "Oh I see Mr Thabethe umfo ka Mavundla 😂🤣🤣😂
Ibo Thabo,what is going on with the video feeding? @TG Swartlane no i see nothing It end abruptly now i got it "Again "Jacob Zuma is here zUMAAAAAAAAA\
Saba Sizwe,I hope he tell the truth
Tupe James,following from Liberia
Piet Madimetja,we hope truet will come out
Thulani Bukani,Who is the witness? isemasimbeni le chap. mayithethe inyani qha. But his signatures are the ones used to authorise the payments "yes
Nonzy,You have internet in Liberia? He is the head of agriculture in a province. A very important role I should think. An economy rests on agriculture. Let's see if we can put so much responsibility on him. Head of Agriculture He sounds like an interviewer. There's a gap there...😁 Are you black? Jeffrey? Ramasunga? what kind of SA black is that from? He was the head of agriculture actually The coin hasn't dropped yet. We block it. can't see anything
Ntokozo Madonsela,info guys what happening today? gorvement people don't go to Pension 😂😂 he still insist on pensio😂 Mr Thabethe @Mthuthuzeli agriculture Mr Thabethe hes well educated👌 lol can someone help us with section 25 pls wrong choice Mr Thabethe to choose SA then Brazil Mzala so true but looking@ him now
Anne M.,@SABC Digital News At the tea break please check the picture sound. It's out of sync. Thanks. "@goolamv Former Free State Department of Agriculture Head of Department @promise moroshadi Free State Department of Agriculture @Mzalwane Mzala Wise words @Lorraine Naidoo Please name a university which accepts a person with a 30% mark. "@Pastor J Yip "@Martin De Beer Sigh @whitepope5 Please quote your source @Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana Very true @carnoth ngomane 😂🤣 "@John Fagan Former Free State Department of Agriculture Head of Department He was implicated by a previous witness and has asked to come to the commission to give his side
monaheng raboroko,cost order loaded. #publicprotector @goolamv she has lost. She was ordered to pay 85% to two councils of DA & Casac That's a personal cost order @goolamv
Christopher Nong,Is it my pc or @SABC Digital News the is no sound @goolamv Thanks managed to get it working
Tshepo Selepe,I think he will survive Thulani Smh white ignorance Pieter The assumption is that Uni has 30%pass rate chao Not really just making a calculated assumption Please name said countries cause some of us have actually studied in multiple countries with degrees from SA Pieter write properly because I'm lost now on what you are saying 🤔 Ngomane I let that one slide because its clear there isn't anything factual here Pastor J some people are beyond being educated because of their prejudice It does Doesn't matter if you have to ask why my guy. Pieter where in Amsterdam are you based?
makhosi nobhatyi,The man smiled confidently about these docs maybe he is going to defend himself @ carnoth ngomane eish we want the truth no more lies as we are waiting for president to come to testify @ Phindile Ntombela at least 65 years @ carnoth ngomane he was looking to gain resources and benefits and re employed elsewhere that is happening to all government departments @ Tabze exactly as I thought so High judgement said PP should pay 75% full amount on her own pocket with Estina matter @ Cerebis thanks for correction PP is in trouble here more darkness flow on top of her head "PP start working with senior advocates if she wants to win her cases "We must all be positive and be alert for now nothing to worry so far No we don’t need her back @ chris nkonki
Mzalwane Mzala,@goolamv and @monaheng raboroko I am struggling to find news on the matter "Ok "Judgement @PublicProtector should be “personally liable” for percentage of legal costs in Estina report. She must pay 85% of costs in her official capacity 7 The fundraisers for the PP have more work to do. @goolamv That is a journalist's tweet. Maybe she made a mistake. Karyn Maughan Those of us who were/are in government have to learn that politicians can compromise and leave you in the cold. Always be professional. The PP issued a report that blames only the officials and not the politicians that were key in the Estina scandal. These two days are going to be very long for Mr Thabethe. @Ntokozo Madonsela He was thinking of the kids who were at school. @Ntokozo Madonsela With hindsight. Ms Gcabashe is thorough. @goolamv 'Mkhwebane must pay 7.5% of the costs of the DA and 7.5% of the costs of Casac in her personal capacity' (News24). I guess that makes 85% from PP Office and those 2 sums of 7.5% for her. @goolamv Thanks for raising that question it got me curious. Zondo really tries to be fair BREAKING NEWS: Murder charges withdrawn against Newcastle mayor Thabethe started well but he is losing it now.
Pastor J.J,She has been ordered to pay 7.5% of the DA and CASAC costs @Anne M. I would also love to know the answer to your question. It is really idiotic for people to believe and share that 30% gets someone into university @Tshepo Selepe It is amazing when you ask for justification they just shut up. @Christopher Eddy Indeed correct
grace Marr,Fivecdf. /
Phindile Ngubane,🤣 pensioner is how old Sir? lol let's give the pensioner a chance. I've never heard of a country that has rejected a S.An. qualification. In fact this country is one of the best globally especially when it comes to research. @Viewing do you have facts to support your statement? 🙄
tabze,vele how old is he? @makhosi nobhatyi I think he's around 56 him he has looted too much that's why he retired earlier @Robert Russell that's true that WE are waiting ☻☻ "I'm not aware I was under investigations
promise moroshadi,and he is still enjoying retirement Mr Thabethe @Makhosi from which department?
Jabu Nhlanhla,mrng naidoo yes fikele looks lyk together as one smith viva

"Zwane's group choir ate the curry in India "accountability is key Raju when last u check Ajah @Raju tell the family we miss them here in SA
Mbombi,Agriculture in Free State "I know this Mr Thabethe personally but it's been years since I last saw him lol "Mr Thabethe please represent us well "I believe in you Mr Thabethe
Robert Russell,US the tax payer FFS @goolamv Soon you can attach your criminal record as well Education received in SA before 94 is generally recognised internationally. SA had one of the highest levels of education in the world. Since 94 their has been no control on the quality of education. "In fact "@whitepope5 and the question has to be """"what has the ANC government done to eliminate these issues""""? The answer is NOTHING because they are too busy stealing from these very people." You want the ANC to run the NHI...... they can't run a cake sale without stealing the ingredients..... name one SOE that has been successful under the ANC government My point is that how do we trust the ANC with a budget of R256Bn for the NHI when they stole/miss manged Eskom to the tune of R440Bn and growing.....@carnoth ngomane
Smart Guys,agree Goolam Bhai
Freedom now,Lorraine at a 30 % pass rate anybody can get a degree Tshepo Selepe they call it the truth!! Tshepo Selepe quick with the race card!! Don;t think so when you have nothing to say out comes the race card i wonder if he has a degree in looting. It seems there are a lot of those!!! Tshepo Selepe why is it that other countries don;t except degree from South Africa? are they also racists Hey they don;t except degrees from South Africa I'm outside the country and where i am people have to go back to Uni .Because they don't except degrees from SA Tshepo Selepe does it matter?? Tshepo Selepe why? Isaaco Mhlongo ? No racism go back to school Isaaco Mhlongo not once have i refer to race Diana Sekatane understatement They use to raid each others villages and steal cattle and women.Its in there DNA @ Viewing agree100% 👌 @ Daud Musa work for it I have better things to do

Viewing,WE must discuss how BEE should be outlawed. "@Lorraine Naidoo Many BEE beneficiaries in South Africa "@Lorraine Naidoo This is their way of ""Correcting pains of the past"" meanwhile they invaded on mass scale Zuma was caught with 440 Million in Nkandla of Gadaffi and nothing happened to him. Black Corruption taking place. "@Lorraine Naidoo They won't get anything from me "@goolamv ""Fake News"" by the way @goolamv Case is still pending once again. @Tshepo Selepe Anyone can be educated. "the 30% joke Corruption and looting needs to be eliminated along with direct arrests for the daily Riots. "@Phindile Ntombela It took a majority vote to enable it to drop from 50% to 30%. and yes "@Phindile Ntombela In other countries they will never accept anyone with a ""Degree"" that they got with the help of BEE." Black Monopoly Capital and Corruption is being exposed. @Isaaco Mhlongo Are you braindead or brainwashed? nothing said was racist. @Daud Musa Race Card lol. Typical. Loool @Daud Musa No race card was used. You use it though. When it comes to ANC and EFF. It's Everything for free. """We want free water and sewage and Electricity in Port Elizabeth""-Land Grabbers." @Daud Musa Lol another Race Card. @Cerebis Two parties filled with criminals lol "@pieter Du Plessis Indeed @Daud Musa More race card excuses. You're a simple racist at heart. @Daud Musa There is no land issue. Go work and pay for it like all of us. @whitepope5 BEE can be blamed. "@pieter Du Plessis Indeed mate "@Greg Rowles Also it was planned with SACP as well "@Daud Musa We as Whites built everything @Daud Musa Lets use your crime rate for example.

Martin De Beer,"Oh my Thats why politicians get away with the stuff they do. They work to make/keep us divided and fighting among ourselves.... 1st show us what exactly is being done with the allready billions of Health budget and why that is not going where it should and then can we consider giving more money "But Ramaphosa said it will go ahead Not His Issue = NHI @ Wilson Hishono 1st show us what exactly is being done with the allready billions of Health budget and why that is not going where it should and then can we consider giving more money "Not against universal healthcare - it exists but has been nearly destroyed by the clowns who are suppose to serve the citizens. Sort out the clowns I agree Free - only 5-10% and unfortunately they are the loudest Exactly what I said in my previous post I I I I I ... i I .. This practice notes lol @carnoth ngomane it can work but not there is already healthcare with a huge budget not being used for what it should.. That needs to be fixed 1st before leving another 3 % tax and 2+% VAT @Robert Russell And they will not tell us where the current healthcare budget is being spent on - can't even manage that. Destroyed the whole free healthcare

Greg Rowles,"ha ha @Viewing BEE <> RET (corruption campaign of ANC) "RET is a corruption campaign South Africa is overpopulated and undereducated; we have overpopulation for the size of our economy "not enough education you're also a racist "@Daud Musa when you got nothing better to add to the discussion "i won't though our economy is shrinking; ppl demand jobs; the govt wants to strip the rights off land ownership; businesses will get smaller along with our incomes "we have over population for the scale of our economy; we don't have enough businesses popping up
