Born free,Save the nation from the hyenas and stealing from the public purse. Vote DA What about Zuma and Magashule they are out there campaigning as if they have done nothing wrong. What is frightening is that these hyenas and public purse stealers have no guilt. DA ❎ These investigations into State Capture will become dormant again if the ANC win the elections. ANC have had 25 years to deliver on their policies. Time has run out. "It doesn't matter what Zondo does and he will do his job well Save The Nation From The Hyenas that steal from the public purse.. Vote DA Save The Nation From The Hyenas That Steal From The Public Purse. Vote DA Kay Kay.. yes you are correct. If you vote ANC then you must vote for Ramophosa because you do not want the State deputy President David Mabuza as President.. he has a muddied past. Infact most of the ANC has a muddied past and present Yes the ANC is better than the EFF but the DA is the best. They will have to wait another 25 years If Infrastructure is built it then gets vandalised and set on fire by protestors so how do you win? United the ANC Hyenas stand and United they must fall Yes they conspired to remove Mbeki with the assistance of Julius Malema who was very involved in State Capture in the Limpopo province. Malema Malema has also been under investigation and still is but these cases went dormant hence this testimony from Booysen. Of all the ANC candidates I would say Cyril Ramophosa is the only way forward for the ANC. I will vote DA haha Ryan I gotcha haha Ryan have fun rocking the boat 😂🤣 Previous Police Chief now in jail "I will vote EFF if I can share in the profits of State capture and I want to be allocated land and a house with 34 bedrooms I will vote EFF if they share the profits of State capture with me "swimming court Save The Nation From The Hyenas That Steal From The Public Purse. VOTE DA Just remove the union jack from the flag and all will be well 😅 Ryan has the EFF promised you a share in their state capture? Ryan there you go again.. inciting the murder of the very people that feed your face. Does Ryan know how much he will be fined? Ryan the EFF have promised you a share of the public purse. I mean anyone with half a brain cell would not vote for that EFFING party of bandits. Ryan.. you have half a brain cell and it is very lively in there. Please will the EFF give the communities free birth control if you really want to make a difference. No Jacob it would be your 21st wife.. wenna still can't count 🙈 no it is an Imposter Exactly it would take him days to print one word Jacob have you finished campaigning for today? Jacob I thought I saw you with Jiba you were very close together "Jacob you wanted Jiba as your many wives but when she said ""No baba"" I want to be head advocate of the NPA you gave her the job."
Abel Manyedi,my big X is nxt t d DA too
Mxolisi Dladla,vote ANC ❎ True Mr Booysen
Mzalwane Mzala,All the polls show a shrinking DA support in these elections. pat de Lille is dealing nicely with the DA in the Western Cape @Kay Kay All ANC members are called upon to campaign for a decisive victory of the people's movement. The Sunday Times continue to put itself in positions where it get used.
tshepho molepa,i wonder how long is this state capture is going to take i doubt that DA agree with your view of apartheid flag @carnoth i get you lol.
Cassius Mngomezulu,U vote DA U VOTE For Steihuizen for President It took you 5000 years to oppress blacks VOTED ALREADY FOR THEE ANC "tjoo so fast-no one is arrested yet @psyfrequency Techno- YOU LOVE MY NAME NE "Maimane will will be removed from DA watch the space His only a recruiter after all the few blacks give them votes his gone ANC FOR LIFE
Sam Mabitsela,i looking forward to vote for EFF i want to see fast changes n by EFF we will b covered.
carnoth ngomane,@tshepho molepa DA is an offspring of that flag and what it stands for so they wont mind "@Cassius Mngomezulu you are correct hence they brought Tony Leon to help with the election campaign @psyfrequency Techno a less confident person keeps repeating himself @Val Speirs Yes you are correct DA is the best for the white minority
Kay Kay,"@Val Spiers Zondo is satisfied with the evidence leader it seems This Booysen fella is very intelligent beki Cele! Richard Mdluli was dangerous creature Booysen is now dropping heavy bombshells Did I hear the name Karima Brown? "@Val Speirs "@Kapn Krunk General Booysen is really speaning the bean today "@Pheladi Lamola "@Nelson Musoliwa who's Jacky Selebi? "@makhosi nobhatyi Is Shamila Batohi in the house? Shuuuu! Ntlemeza was biggest mistake the hawks ever had! I quote Mbaks fired Ntlemeza outright "I like the way Mbalula is fighting those who want to sabotage CR and the ANC from within like Supra Is he's emotional? That last statement summed it all "no proper law enforcement agencies no country
Ndidendavela Nam Bathembu Mgudlwa,This advocate is out of depth
Granny Mokwena,"you said the same thing about Maimane being removed in 2016 too
Fils de l'homme,Let us VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAl Let us VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL Let us VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL...

Sebation Nantsika,@techno ask who ever give you that flag about blacks @Techno your racist attitude wont help DA to win elections @techno then speak like you want change the country stop blaming like Musi Maimane @techno the problem is you don’t lesson to the black President of the country @techno I’ll engage you after you remove the flag of blood @techno died doing what @techno tel me about the flag especially colours are symbolizing what
Sthakathi Khumalo,"Bheki Cele
Kapn Krunch,corruption isn't a mistake it's a conscious decision this flag nonesense comes out just before an election just to stoke cultural Marxism to keep everything racialized and that's the only way the ANC stays in power by making everything racial let's face it malema was zumas right hand and turned on him when he was denied a bigger piece of the pie
Christian Boonzaaier,@manzi what flag are you talking about? More blood has been shed under the current flag fyi "The right and moral thing the ANC can do is to completely disband and begin from scratch...but they will never do that...there isn't a single honest bone in their entire body...no morals @psyfrequency Techno It blows my mind how any rational human being can actually defend and support parties like the ANC ... Stockholm Syndrome is big here in SA Stockholm syndrome: a condition which causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity. Sums up ANC supporters pretty well id say who is going to fund all the free stuff if you chase us out Ryan? a vote for the eff and we will be worse off than Venezuela in no time...please don't fall for the lies of Malema... @ryan john you have been reported for hate speech and inciting violence. hahah @ryan john whats your thoughts on the BLF?
Papi Jan,state capture kapn politics are other things
Pheladi Lamola,I felt sorry for Phiyega when I thought she was being made a scapegoat regarding the Marikana tragedy but now I think I'm taking my sorry back. Yes @Kay Kay. Power really did go to her head. And greed maybe. I thought she had more integrity than that.
Nelson Musoliwa,R Ndluli should have already serving his prison term if law enforcement agencies were not captured by zuma 'sstooges
Naledzani Mashau,"Let him spill the beans  "Cyril Ramaphosa is also from the same pot of hooligans and thugs in the ANC.We need a SA that even our kids will be proud of.They also stole millions at OR Tambo Airport ANC? I will never put my cross on that box till I depart this world. "ANC government do not have the interest of its people at heart.What type of a government does that?Under the ANC
