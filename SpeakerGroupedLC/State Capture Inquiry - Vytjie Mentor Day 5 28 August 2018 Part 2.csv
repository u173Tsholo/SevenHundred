Greg Stewart,"typical case of ""dont take responsibility"" report a problem and dont follow up - I did my part" okay🤔 akakhoni kufunda Mentor - lamafarikigi afile sad but anc sounds totally rotten agree subtitles horrible
ashlee ka ndlovu,so this guy Fils de l'homme is calling people Bantu as a replacement mechanism- we see through your BS the meaning on google and the way you use it are not the same "no one said you are racist
S Oliphant,mentor doesn't want to commit to her answers I observe that white people in general suffer from a superiority complex fils what is bantu?
Tobo Lwandile,"block fils he's crazy
Sofonia Lethuba,cross examination will liberate us.
TP Muofhe,eish why are we still calling him the president!!! leave hr alone ey theres a somithing making a weird sound
Auti Mjita,Fils has no idea how racism manifests itself in south africa "We should not miss what the terms of reference for the commission are; this is not a court of law O dom 😃@Sofia Sofia 😉 That pretty boy might enjoy it @noko yamebetlwa I am gay "why Fils "Im not a girl I still don't want you though 😀 And the rears flow....

abongile abosh,if this commission is honest former president should be arested Fils de the information found in this commission is going to use in court of law for those who committed crim
ntokozo mncube,@abongile if evidence was beyond any reasonable doubt then we wouldnt have needed a commission to start with. "with what has been presented so far This is a funny democracy @Fils de l'homme yes i am. "@Bongani Zondo is boss How does he know an offer was made if it hasnt been established and tested that it was? "@Musa im saying her story will be thrown out of court @Arthur S'fiso Gumede wenzani la mkhulu? Zuma was always ahead of time. anikaboni niks. "H edid not say he doesnt not know here I'm no lawyer but i can tear this woman apart in cross examination. "Kudlawa ngo Nxamza la Follow where the money goes to in govt then you will knw who captures the state. If this woman would be allowed to have so many memory lapses then Msholozi will also be allowed not to have ant recollection of her she also has lots of issues with people as well.
Niematullah Rakeep,So on my FB oage I predicted Vytjies evidencecare all based on her FB page postings?
Philani Madlala,Just block that Fils Fils is racial understooded? 🙄🙄🙄
Chris Chauke,let the commission make a recommendation for arrest ! "@Ntokozo  why didn't she ask a copy of her handwritten statement then?
Eddy Mokwena,be deceive on your dates
Orefile Macheoane,Social Media is binding in so many ways. Even your VISA is linked to your facebook account
Ayanda Manyeku,it is clear now if why president Zuma wanted a period of 6 months when the ANC tolled him to resign volluntary.........He wanted to cover his scadals with the Guptas

Duduzile Nhlapo,advert now ...
Pholosho Malema,eix
Bongani Mchunu,Why is this advocate interrogating a whistle blower like she is a criminal? This will discourage anyone with information. unokuphaphanyana yet incompetent This advocate cannot interrogate a lay person. she speaks like she is talking to another advocate.
Yahya Akoojee,.
