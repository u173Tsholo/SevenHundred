Born free,"McKinsey
Michael Setlaku,Now this is the Indian version of Agrizzi😝
Phillip Moshapo,Let the truth come out we are rebuilding the ANC
Musa Bakiti,Osama of corruption Mr President free our king now Well done ANC although i wished victory for EFF Tears of a Lion Nomvula our leader and J G Zuma back in the list @Felix Muyoba this guy is fasting and he cannot lie
Cassius Mngomezulu,Musa Bakiti​Osama of corruption-😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😁😂 Guys are you aware that Indians(Guptas alike) are in the middle of every thing in SA
Derek Main,@Phillip Moshapo Pull the other one - it has bells on it. @Luvuyo Zantsi I don't mind how the 'natives' voted - I'm more concerned about the fools. @Carnoth Ngomane Unfortunately the majority of SAfns have voted for more of the same. They obviously can't rub 2 brain cells together. @Luvuyo Zantsi Somebody has to think for you. @Luvuyo Zantsi It's more surprising that someone has to tell you not to vote for thieves. @Carnoth Ngomane Why? Are you embarrassed? @Luvuyo Zantsi Not even a 'baas' can force you to think for yourself. @Carnoth Ngomane And we live with the consequences. I am going to continue to remind the fool ANC voters of this each time we hear of more ANC corruption. @Luvuyo Zantsi To vote for thieves is to be a fool. @Luvuyo Zantsi To protest against poor service delivery one day and vote for the very party that is not delivering is to be a fool. @Luvuyo Zantsi I would have been happy for them just to think. @Luvuyo Zantsi How much further does the ANC have to drag SA down before the ANC voters realise the error of their ways? @barbara broadbent Never underestimate the criminality of the ANC. @makhosi nobhatyi SA needs to be liberated from the liberators turned plunderers. Nope - brazen plunder. Corrupt to the core. @Granny Mokwena Ask the ANC - they will have some spin or other. @makhosi nobhatyi Not possible for the ANC - they're corrupt to the core. Remember my words a year down the line when we have slipped even further under the thieves. @Felix Muyoba Exactly - yet the voters still cling to the fantasy that one man can turn everything around. Even though he was silent as DP when all this corruption continue. @makhosi nobhatyi We expect no different from the ANC. @makhosi nobhatyi Gwede Mantashe got security installed by Bosasa - how is he not implicated? Or is that just ANC spin? @makhosi nobhatyi Your own integrity committee fingered Mantashe but we all know the ANC will ignore them.
Bridgette Kekana,Mr President promised us that those were implicated at Zondo commission will go to jail pls the wrongdoers must go to jail like Nomvula Ace Supra n the rest list is endless we need clean governance we will take to the street we are no more fools or they must pay back the money
Robert Russell,@Derek Main....Phillip is right..... the ANC are rebuilding....with stolen bricks... eat first pay later ? @Derek Main ...heres a clue.... VENEZ........ you fill in the dots The ANC will keep this commission going for 5 years so that Jelly Fish Ramafaker does not have to act on his comrats Wait till we see who is on the list for parliament.... none of the crooks from the Zuma/Ace faction will be removed... just wait....and see The reason I say that is that CR only acts when a commission/inquiry makes a recommendation.... even the ANC ethics team are disregarded shows how deep the crooks are in-bedded in the ANC @makhosi nobhatyi ....yes we will be surprised when all the same crooks are in parliament... to demonstrate that CR is week.... surprise...surprise Lets all be back here on the 22nd of May and have a laugh..... Exactly @Derek Main.... if I was a crook.... I would want to be part of team ANC.... for sure I heard it was 2 years....i.e. 2021 And trust me Neil.... funds will keep diapering whilst the ANC are protecting their comrats That i where the majority of theft takes place.... ask Ace.the thief ....@Neil Fraser
Dilip Badal,"@Bridgette Kekana ...If you believe the president A Point to ponder...... retirement funds amounts to something like 2 trillion rands in the kitty..invested locally... Watch The ANC amend the constitution to attach that... Run folks .dont walk. Run
Danie Nilsen,"i know the election is over but is it realy over or are there a agenda that will start soon now it seems that the anc voters are keeping a fraudelent party in power for fear of the emnarresment that this said fraudelant anc party wil be in the public scrutany AA kept the corupteers in busness and so they must in a serious effort keep the defaulters in place if they should loose it will be losing face as in japanese culture close to suicide
Carnoth Ngomane,"@Luvuyo Zantsi i thought the election chapter was closed "@Derek Main you cant change the inevitable "@Derek Main not at all @Cassius Mngomezulu yea seems their fingerprins are all over
Granny Mokwena,not this again from R9million(not exceeding) to exceeding R280millions😓😓 how does anyone justify this blatant theft? greedy comrades got us here sadly just put people who know what they're doing there I don't know anything about tenders but he makes too much sense😂 when is anoj yestifying
The Truth,@Thando Nkutha I Zondo has health issues... his breathing and coughs don't sound normal "@Thando Nkutha A friend who does IT at the commission told me they asked him to switch off the mic when not talking
Michael Menzies,oak has a cool beard man. anybody wanna buy some shortbread? R5 for a dope cookie boss here's a taste chief 🍪 is it because he's fat? where's my safe space this fat shamming is triggering...

KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Xenophobia? @KasambiBategeka.... you mean we xenophobic? "@KASAMBI BATEHEKA
barbara broadbent,"@Derek...i wouldn't have thought SA could go any further down "I wouldn't dare do that Derek they have no shame either!!
makhosi nobhatyi,"Thank you Fellow South Africans for voting liberation movement "@ Derek main ANC is the party for all people "@Derek main as president said change is painful and hard to accept Look guys here what ever comes out here is binding i was listening to Ace Magashule saying saying commission findings are not binding which he shows they may defiance to show up to the commission "NPA "@ Felix Muyoba I am serious about this You will see surprise next week when President announces his new cabinet "@ Roberts Russell no he said publicly no one must be on the cabinet implicated Bathabile and Nomvula won’t be in government Zizo jika izinto new dawn "I was listening to the youth league this morning calling eThekwini mayor to step aside while NPA is investigating the corruption and fraud Guptas whistle blower is ready to testify
Felix Muyoba,a business case cannot be a one man show.. @Granny Mokwena meaning R271m went to waste? @Robert Russell that is so true the business case was overstated to justify the looting this fellow is very eloquent in his testimony @Musa Bakiti 😂😂 @Mike Moja i gave him the bells already
MAKOTOKO,inquiries in South Africa is just waist of time. since time is money

Khaya Vicious,can never trust a capitalist imagine if that nevfer hqappened
Wilhelm5381,Jirre die mense kan steel... imagine if all the ingenuity employed to steal were to be spent for the benefit of the people...
Patrick Kanatla,let's them dance for what they voted for (poor for ever)
Mike Moja,@Felix Muyoba very eloquent. he knows his story I like this man. he knows his story. please give him bells @Felix Muyoba 💪🙏
Magda Seguin,So many people believed the EFF when they attacked Gordhan when he started cleaning up at PRASA.Since the testimonies started of what really happened they are quiet. "The theft is mind boggling The Durban Mayor was arrested (and rightfully so) for much less...it makes no sense that the masters of state capture including Zuma is still free Manoj will not testify unless he is subpoenaed The list of those who benefited from Dubai flights and Oberoi hotel stays was published yesterday...Koko is one of them...he is still very vocal on Twitter as if he is innocent You are correct @Robert Russell "The prosecution of those implicated will be concurrent "I sincerely pray and hope that NDZ or Dlamini don't get top positions in parliament "The PRASA board at the time are even worse than the Eskom board "PRASA has an enormous budget
Singi Mathebula,where is Advocate Malika? woman had n opportunity t elect a woman as a deputy at Nasrec. Crodile tears. stupid just finished reading the Gangster state. Depressing 😱
Neil Fraser,@Magda Seguin Do you know when the inquiry is eventullu meant to wind up? Thanks Robert. It's quite depressing listening at the ease how the state funds went down the drain. "@Robert Russell - Agree. Nut we are only hearing about some of the ""big fish"". What about local municipalities
