farouq,State Capture should go on netflix 😀🤣🤣 @Heather Durr Imahine we all here waiting (I wont say patiently) for 14:00 both Jacob Zuma foundation and advocate skhakhane do not respect this commission at all
Heather Durr,@farouq I thought I was the only one who discovered that they found someone to fit in today "@Fred Desrosiers BBBEE is a huge contributor to corruption. Seems this is how Phosa made his billions @Terrance Henri Miles Huh-how did you manage that @lali Naidoo Zuma has a huge following -you wont get him into jail. Radical conspiracies swirl around him all coming back to the white man and grounded in a loathing for whites -revenge "@Terrance Henri Miles You were an alcoholic went to jail now you are dry-Why 57 years-did you murder someone  "@ALTA Hi @ALTA Didnt DCJ say they were adjourned today and Chaskalson back tomorrow with the actual money flows and Powell So today it will be Kennedy and Denel @Khaos 70 Just google it-there is an article @Khaos 70 Google Copa nyeni HAH this is the crook @bongile sango exactly-maybe Kennedy asked He is in the dwang this one Oi Oi Oi Kennedy not so accommodating today @Valencia J LOL BOOM 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Oh the AIRCONDITIONER/TEA/ LUNCH @Lethabo Malatji Me too @dee dee cocroft I agree totally jy lieg jou skelm He learnt from Gugu @Valencia J Dudu Myeni He had a haircut That guy from Denel on Friday 13 must have seen this hence his abject disrespect DCJ determined to send someone to the Hawks this week MANTSHA probably refused to come today DCJ is not concerned Mantsha was saved by zuma-they must get him back Do these guys not go on a course about their obligations @Blake Yogi Hi there I want to see MANTSHA Kennedy has been taking lessons over the last week Shaken not Stirred...yet Kennedy⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡🔥🔥🔥 @Tshepo Alidi You left your brain cell at home @Sabelo Nxumalo Oh you mean the insults yesterday I believe he did not listen to her as she was black @Sabelo Nxumalo Tell me something that I care about-I dont give a ***** what you think with your agenda and bias @Sabelo Nxumalo Its not that I expected you to be logical and be aware of your racism Zuma's cult are infiltrating this chat The ex head of NPA was rabitting on about Zuma being innocent of something BATHROOM BREAK TIME Kate is SAA COMFORT BREAK CHAIR-ARE YOU NOT LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH Go get him Kennedy >>>>>>>>>>>>>> 'Indeed' He did not like to take instructions from women esp black women. Remember that secretary He left Denel He is stubborn this one I had to prepare the handbook and the PFMA is RIGID @Kevin Davis Google Egypt Corruption-be surprised I KNEW IT COMFORT BREAK @Walter Zikalala Respect is earned. I have no respect for the man they call president. Feel free to block me DCJ is empowered today-getting Zuma off his back must have freed his stress levels Maybe one day sexism will matter When people start taking responsibility for their deeds and stop blaming others only then can we move forward "@Michelle Wright Methinks Sabelo who I have blocked is upset about Zuma yesterday Kennedy is the only one that says 'The Learned Chair' @SanFran Arnold 🙂 @C W Written application in Triplicate in accordance with the PFMA Give Kennedy 10 minutes and he takes an hour BOOM BOOM BOOOM Jy het geweet jy lieg Put 1 and 1 together and let the truth set you free BOOM GOTCHA BOOM GOTCHA HAH THE TRUTH SURFACES Rampant racism as I said HEY HE JUST SAID HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH TRANSFORMATION-Thats why he did not listen to black persons @Tomb raider What point?

Gill Oosthuizen,is there anything happening today??
Sandi Xaso,Everybody is equal before the law and law must start biting those implicated in malfeasance and corruption. We encourage the DSJ to be strong in his present challenges caused by dissenting forces

Chris Vas,I really appreciated yesterday’s witness. That is the way of doing business. Well done
SD Gudunkomo,DO YOU see this commission succeeds in getting the truth about state capture? will it succeeds in its try to force Zuma to answer before the chair compile the report? "m reading comments There are no insults throwing to the witness why? Kerry I am asking because I see something rear happening here Kerry you will see what I am talking about when the witness is black.insults. Kerry I am talking about insults that always thrown to witnesses.why today people are so calm.chatting about other things? Ayanda I have been watching. I will remind you guys tomorrow when the witness is black.I have been noticing this bias happening here. Pastor the degree is not the same.there is calmness when the witness is white Kerry race is every where. You know what I am talking its just that it's hard for you to accept Tomb Raider its true. Kerry you mean white witnesses treated this way because they are not corrupt and black get insults because they are corrupt? Have you guys seen the Thuma mina Media group? "Charles that's what I am also saying mayb the commission do not want to hear their evidence But honestly ANC is better than any government that we ever had in South Africa.disagree? Michelle we don't have any other choices.ANC gave us rights Mangalani enough Charles we never had a country "Mangalani what economy Mangalani its like you are comparing houses for the rich in your neighborhood while you are in a shack Moses that is not regarded as corruption. ARREST IS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN AFTER THIS SITTING👀 Mangalan shacks were brought by the being excluded in the economy. Thulane Its a must to investigate crime economic participation Aubrey if Zuma is arrested then the commission will fail RDP houses are built out of the tax we pay Mangalini. Zuma is not gonna say anything Mangalin Aubrey do Ramaphosa takes responsibility of 500billion for vivid 19? covid 19 Mangalin if that is the case why they have to compel him to come to the commission? had.. Aubrey but Apartheid president De Klerk refused to take accountability for crimes they committed even white don't want to accept that they benefited from injustices of the apartheid. Aubrey if you able to say somebody has to account for what he had done you also has to do that. Do to others what you are prepare to accept when it is done to you Michelle you didn't work for what your parents left it for you Michelle this black generation inherited poverty while present white generation inherited wealth how did it come about? Mike how do you prove the 1976 killing of school children? Michelle you have to accept the truth and take responsibility. yes Moses.most of them got their first cares while still at high high school "Michelle I corrected that Tomb Raider. no they didnt🤣 Michelle nah we are telling the truth.and you know that. AYANDA she is trying to fight what her conscience. Michelle why trying so hard opposing truth when it's a known Michelle did you know that if white people had ubuntu we will be living inharmony in this this country. Aubrey but you are living in the past.the Wealth you accumulated is from the injustices done to blacks atleast by your forefathers MIKE BUT OUR LAND WAS TAKEN BY FORCE.SURELY SOMEBODY OWES US Mike that is easy if you have land don't you think so Mike land act of 1913 was not a barter system @Tomb Raider Thanks

Anne M.,"Hi @ALTA  Might be the witness was prepared to come in on a different day? @bongile sango @ALTA 😘 Hi @Valencia J "@Emmanuel Nyatlo That's what I thought had to happen 😄 @Valencia J Especially with the calibre of investigators at the commission @Valencia J . These investigators could find out my grandfather's secrets 😉 @Valencia J "He does seem to enjoy the sound of his own voice "Stephan Burger You've just contradicted yourself Burger Hi @Blake Yogi And they again ignored her. You're right @Nyange Ndimbuza "They have different streams @khulekani bonelani . When we hear evidence for (e.g. SABC) "@Nyange Ndimbuza With Denel being such a strategic company @weaverbird b Adv Paul Pretorius is the leader of the legal team. Her input was dismissed. Don't try and couch it in other words. @Ishaad Mohammed He lulls the witness into a false security and then he strikes. Thanks @Mangalani Mangalani Flame grilled ? @Tumelo Legodi 😂 This is his 3rd or 4th time here @bongile sango Trying again.

Hello B @SanFran Arnold ":virtualhug: @SanFran Arnold Fewer people on the chat @SanFran Arnold Have you been listening from the beginning or only joined a little while ago? Did you hear when Adv Kennedy referred to Burger's 170 page affidavit? 👍 @Wele IG "Adv Kennedy who is usually cool "Yup @Valencia J It's a big spiders web And his son didn't discuss business matters with him @Wele IG when the self-same son was a Gupta business partner. 🤦‍♀ "What is the most corrupt business in the world? @Wele IG It's the arms industry. Denel would enable the Guptas to be international ""players"". SAA I second that @Valencia J "I haven't heard different

Arctic,"guys everything state capture the actual accused nr 1 is the anc every corrupt deal is a piggyback for the anc when the needed money  the reason why they now have no money to pay members and staff is because all corrupt payments from the piggyback are on hold due to the attention on corruption in the country

Canis Africanis,How on earth? @ALTA GA @Heather Durr Yes. To know what not to do what they're supposed to do... "Overruled A very humble man... He's hesitating because he must qualify that he's not sinister. "When in doubt Don't play victim to the circumstances you created. Victimhood gives us great moral superiority and entitles us to unquestioning sympathy while exempting us from examining any single one of our actions. @Aubrey De Bliquy Well said. "As I'd seen over and again "Without the possibility of the corrupt being jailed "@Pastor J.J Yes "...sad Stop playing the race card! "Identity politics is always a red herring "When a corrupt criminal ... it was my duty? "When a corrupt criminal is doing something that is questioned "Again @Kevin Nunes You exclude Egypt? Don't play victim to the circumstances you created. Frustrated! """I was frustrated because people gave me advice I didn't want to hear""" F1 for me. 120km/h for you. "Playing the victim is a toxic waste of time that not only repels other people Thanks for this inquiry. Our ignorance on corruption is their power. @Sabelo Nxumalo Do you know where the current white generation live? How old are you? "@Mike Durban The ""communists"" are the principled leaders in this country!" The duty of youth is to challenge corruption. – Kurt Cobain Lies don't fix things. Best to tell the truth and then clean up an honest mess. Free advice...
Gavin Craythorne,Same story as Alexkor and the diamond sales through a Gupta company Screw the enterprise policies Screw the PFMA If? If?? He makes out like he is really being patient with the Commission.

Blake Yogi,Hi everyone 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ How are you all doing? Cartwheeling right into a hot hot seat going on here. it is burning up Hey @Heather🙏 "@Valencia J 😄😄😄
Tumelo,We arehere
Aubrey De Bliquy,Hiding behind the collective. Hi @ALTA and @Naledi Barron When did this start? @Naledi Barron And I was about to take a nap. Now I am awake. Service above self Public servant dedicated to advocate for the people. @g g Sadly people with such an ethic are few and far between. All things being equal is word salad with no meaning. There was every way of knowing that. Your actions were were contrary to policy. After 20 years the Peter principle got him to a job he could not do. @Naledi Barron But the business he was growing did not work. @Kerry van Schalkwyk Yes. You can see Zondo taking everything in while reserving judgement but not shrinking from clarifying witness frame of mind. Hi @Canis Africanis The wheels of justice grind slow but sure. The DA strikes me as a bunch of expedient politicians without a better moral compass than their opponents who like the old United Party that want to run with the fox and hunt with the hound. Ugh... @Pastor J.J Its weird how USA can put a man on the moon but free and fair elections is like Rocket science. LOL @Pastor J.J They mock the Zimbabwe monetary inflation but they did that to the world currency and we have no planet B so they have to Covert 19 the world economy and Reset a system that cannot work. @Canis Africanis 💯 @PHIL RAMBAU Yes but have you noticed while crooks come in all ethnic flavours so do some of the most admirable people of integrity and competence who are the silent salt of the earth. Where does EFF fit into state capture? What is the purpose of having signing power if it is just a rubber stamp for someone elses decision? A judge is above Party politics. Otherwise all ANC accused would be innocent and everyone else guilty. @Santa Kriel Why should you have shame because he is your race? This group guilt is a marxist idea. It's dumb. We are all individuals. Thats just what you aid. You were told to sign. @Santa Kriel Sorry I was talking noat about you being dumb buat a dumb attitude which is inaccurate and unhelpful. Forensic auditors are excellent at following the money. Crime leaves a distinct financial fingerprint. LOL Its just optionall rules. Like baking a cake. season to taste. @Vishal Maharaj Sounds like a BS burger. He is trying to bend the commissions mind into a pretsel to explain away his errr. I didn't know what I was doing but clever people agreed with me. LOL If Zuma is arrested he could be given bail to the value of Nkandla like Agrizzi. @Sabelo Nxumalo If Zuma has been responsible for the government for which he would no doubt happily accept credit what exxcuse could there be for accepting responsibility for it's failures? @Sabelo Nxumalo When CR is called to explain or testify that is another thing but now we are talking about the events which preceded CR. It sounds like an argument that he stole sweets too so it's OK for me to steal sweets. I dont get your reasoning @Sabelo Nxumalo @Sabelo pointing at anothers crime does not seem a goo defense for criminal activity. The other perswon must also be held accountable whoever it is. @Freddie Van Rhyn Yes it is obvious. Like it or not we are one SOuth Africa. We either suceed together or we fail together and success will not be found along the path of hatred and tribal enmity. We wont fix what is broken in this country with the same racist medicine that sickened us in the first place. @Michelle Wright Waaaat? What caricture of black people are you selling today and why is that not as racist as any group guilt stereotype? Ugh We are in a new South Africa like it or not. Our children are together at school and formed lifelong relationships to the grave. You cannot hate blacks without hating my children. @Michelle Wright I choose to flock with the meek who will inherit the earth by solving probems and not living in the past. @A Y A N D A That is so kind of you. If a little seed grows to a big tree it will be reward enough.
Rahab Takalo,GA gud ppl may i not answer in case i incriminate myself chair "clueless i dont thinl so evidence leader got him:washhands::washhands::washhands::washhands: "these guys thought that their corrupt decisions wil go uncovered big fish for that matter "evidence leader is a slow poison "his conscience is talking to him now just cry man "no you lie "these evidence leaders and the inestigators r doing a great job to uncover the corrupt dealings @bongile cadre deployment period

Grant Herholdt,This guy is a terrible witness. Just block him "I’m worried about the Zondo application to the ConCourt. If Zondo has the power to order Zuma be detained and brought to the commission "@Sabelo "At best Arms deal happened during Mbeki "@ Moses
weaverbird b,that song by shaggy should be 'song of the commission' you could not even put these people in charge of the money if you play monopoly . they are so untrustworthy is this the leader of the commission legal team @Anne M. thanks this guy needs to be taken out and softened up 1950's Afrikana style and then we can proceed much quicker
Dee Moore,Why is he hesitating so much? Shamepies. @Valencia J which one? @Valencia J no.

Black Blue Green and even 1 or 2 Coloured fellas.hehehehehehehe. @PHIL RAMBAU Piet sometimes makes very valid statements.@Piet Vast @Sabelo Nxumalo I hear you Bro @Canis Africanis 100% agreed. Well said @PHIL RAMBAU Yes you are right. Sometimes but most of the time his comments are valid. @Mzalwane Mzala Exactly my thoughts. He seems to think he is above all else. @Santa Kriel 100%agreed. And it should never be tolerated or accepted in any form. @Tomb raider That should never be the case . That is indeed sad @alex makobe wilkinson Sadly we found that out all a bit too late @Mike Moja Greetings bro This is a bad Burger. Send me an HotDog instead. @Naledi Barron That would then be a very tender burger...hehehehehe @Moagi Ngwenya She is here at home with me. You want to chat with her? @Moagi Ngwenya She say she will but the traffic is bad bro @Mangalani Mangalani You are so wrong my friend. I was raised in a shack in the 60's and the Nat Govt was building houses similar to RDP ones in the 70's@Mzalwane Mzala @Mangalani Mangalani .....whats sad and bad is that you will not accept what is fact and truth. Your narrative cannot be a fact. @Valencia J No tie change but certainly did the pampers during the break @SanFran Arnold Dont let anyone get under your skin. @Simsoneous Kultuur Well said. My respect to you @Valencia J I sent you 10 messages without a single response. Whats the ? Darling @Yolo More Greetings Darling

Her name is Celia Malahlela Her name is Celia Malahlela Her name is Celia Malahlela @Santa Kriel SA needs the pretty & the ugly (like myself) to fix the rot in this country. @Sabelo Nxumalo How old are you? "@Sabelo Nxumalo Economically @Sabelo Nxumalo We are comparing economies during various administrations since the Union @mmbudzeni maphola Major 1 is 🔥 & cannot be arrested @mmbudzeni mapholi Forget abt Major 1 being arrested. He is 🔥 @Sabelo Nxumalo Your comparison is laughable if not ironic since shacks were brought by ANC. @Mzwalane Mzala Where & When? @Mzalwane Mzala Where & when? @Sabelo Nxumalo You are wrong @Mzalwane Mzala This confirms my assertion. All shacks were erected after Mandela’s release in 1985. This was done to counter suburbs votes. WE SAW IT BEING IMPLEMENTED HERE IN Alexandra. @Sabelo Nxumalo You probably don’t know anything about Codesa. Codesa brought RDP houses! @Sabelo Nxumalo Zuma can testify from jail Mzalwane Mzala NATS govt didn’t allow any shack to be built @Sabelo Nxumalo Zuma doesn’t hv to say anything for Zondo to make a finding @Mzalwane Mzala Which tax are you referring to? How much is this tax? Pls visit Treasury website to see the total revenue @Pastor J.J looks bad when a pastor is economical with the truth

Tomb raider,Hi guys I think everyone is waiting for crook Pravin Gordon to be cross-examined ... @ALTA - You sexy skat😍 Is today Tuesday? @Valencia J - Hehe I have a crush on @ALTA. .... Friday? @ALTA - Haha I should take 2 kisses from you per day😉 @Valencia J - Yeah those eyes are 😍😍😍😍😍 @ALTA - WE still have to go out on a date😉 Piet is a bot? @Kerry van Schalkwyk - So don't you think Helen Zille should retire? Piet Vast - Attack DA or VF plus for a change😴 @ALTA - LOL I will eventually don't hat if he doesn't stop. @ALTA - So are we still going out on a date? Sandton mandela square. The trumps☺ @Pastor J. J - Wow I didn't know that. To which name? @ALTA - SO wear you favourite dress when we go out on a date. Okay?☺ your * Lol @Pastor J. J... @ALTA - OR LET ME take you to you know Ekasi and we will have pap and vleis 😆😆😆 on our date. @Kerry van Schalkwyk - No. @Pastor J. J - I will look into it.. @ALTA - lol I love simple women 😆😆😆 @Kerry van Schalkwyk - But Zondo is definitely an ANC voter.. @Sabelo Nxumalo - You have a point.. @Sabelo Nxumalo - I agree with your analysis. I have also picked this up.. @Kerry van Schalkwyk - No he is not supposed to show biasness. It is just like those parliament referees . I just forgot their names. They are ANC members but are supposed to be impartial in ruling. @thembisa odendaal - Even the Chief Justice is an ANC member. Lol you don't get those big position if you don't have ANC membership. They are however unbiased. @Pastor J. J - I also don't want to make this a race thing but I have noticed that white witnesses are treated with kid gloves in this chatroom and black ones are viciously attacked @Sabelo Nxumalo @Kerry van Schalkwyk - I can bet my bottom dollar that Zondo is an ANC member. Ask people what is the requirement to get these prominent positions in SA. Answer is ANC membership. @SanFran Arnold - Why are people not as severely critical when it is a white witness in this room? @Sabelo Nxumalo - Did people criticise this white witness while I was away? @SanFran Arnold - No I am talking about how people in this chatroom don't criticise white witnesses as much as they do when it is a black witness. @SanFran Arnold - So let me get this straight. The narrative in this room is black witnesses are far less competent than white witnesses? @SanFran Arnold - Then doesn't this room attack white witnesses as much as they castigate black witnesses? That was @Sabelo Nxumalo concern and I think he is making a fair argument. "@Sabelo Nxumalo - I noted your point and it is quite evident this room is biased. If this witness who is giving evidence today was black @Valencia J - @Sabelo Nxumalo may be a troll in some respect but the issue he raised is valid. I was here when Dudu Myeni and Zuma's lawyer were testifying. They were attacked no-stop. "@Valencia J - Wena you always think race issues are petty. And maybe because you have pigmentation which makes you look white Cool I made my point. It is fine...let us forget about it. No the problem with racism coloureds who are light skinned aren't affected but brown skinned and dark skinned coloureds know what racism is. So it is a complex debate to have. @Valencia J - Is Benny Mccarthy the same coloured you are complexion wise? @Kerry van Schalkwyk - So Zondo is scared of Zuma? @Minnib Prince - You clearly don't know the history of South Africa. Valencia could have easily ticked she that is Caucasian during apartheid and no one would have know that she is actually coloured. @Kerry van Schalkwyk - Buy people on Twitter are criticising Zondo for wanting to take this up with Constitutional court.. but* @Valencia J - Problem is Zondo may show an element of biasness during this process. @Minnib Prince - I don't think you get my point. How does a light skinned coloured person who has physical features which are indistinguishable from a white person suffer racism? @Kerry van Schalkwyk - They think Zondo is indeed showing how biased he is.. @Minnib Prince - Does a light skinned black person look white? Does he have blue and straight hair? Because a light coloured person can have blue eyes and straight making her look almost white .

Moonchild,Kudos to Adv Kennedy & DCJ - great work!! The truth will set you free Mr Burger!! Hello @ALTA 🙂 @Tomb raider - I think so @Tomb raider - or a troll @Aubrey De Bliquy - can you imagine Zondo having to review millions of recordings & documents to make his reports?? He won't be seen for months!! @Aubrey De Bliquy - 100% @Sabelo Nxumalo - are you really making this a white thing?? Does the race card have to come into everything??? "@Sabelo Nxumalo - something ""rear""? We have been praising Kenndedy & DCJ for bringing out the truth @Tomb raider - Either the Cape Party or South African Capitalist Party. Are you an ANC voter? @thembisa odendaal - thank you 🙂 @Sabelo Nxumalo - are you not reading our previous messages? "@Anne M. - yip "@Tomb raider - well *openly "@Heather Durr - yes "@Tomb raider - maybe I am being naive but I don't feel that he has shown any bias towards the ANC in this commission. If he had @Tshepo Alidi - what are you talking about? I have no idea what you are saying @Heather Durr - well said "@Tomb raider - yes of course "@Mogotsi Choane - 100% @Sabelo Nxumalo - get over the race thing. Again - if you wish to hurl insults to this witness @A Y A N D A - true! @Mzalwane Mzala - I think he realises that the deck of cards is starting to fall & he is now very nervous & trying to cover it up with the smiling & laughing. His days are numbered. @Tshepo Alidi I have no idea what you are talking about. It appears that you are stereotyping me as an Afrikaner in a negative way??? "@Sabelo Nxumalo - what you fail to realise is that each witness is judged on their own merits & how they conduct themselves on the stand. It is irrelevant of race @Santa Kriel - agree @Aubrey De Bliquy - you are actually 100% correct. I don't subscribe to the notion that we must take responsibility for people's behaviour just based on race. This guy is far too sweet for my liking!! Sickeningly sweet He still hasn't apologised to Ms Malahlela!! Here the criminals start turning on each other. No honour among thieves "@Lee D. Hendrix - yes @Kopz Koape - hear hear. Instigators of the scamdemic "Please!!! He is definitely hiding information that he knows @A Y A N D A - what kind of company was it? Is it the same one he is referring to? "If I was Burger @Tomb raider - I don't think so. He definitely did the right thing by laying a criminal charge against him & issuing another summons. Zuma must have his day @Fezile Peko - 100% - they need to make the prosecutions!! @Tomb raider - why would people do that? He is going straight to the court of last resort as it is such a matter of national importance. Maybe people don't understand that. @Heather Durr - ha ha. He should improve his reporting & then viewers may be persuaded to watch him rather. @Valencia J - correct "@GIVEN MATSANE - he said he WAS a member of the ANC
