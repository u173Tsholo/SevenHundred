The one with the pea sized brain is certainly back. @redriger I want 2 pleeeeez @Lex Luger Heita @redriger Can they run on the N1 N2 etc? @Lex Luger Like always. Blessed to be amongst my Precious friends @redriger And I thought i Can run my own little Taxi kind of thingie @Lex Luger ...Always my friend. @Fils de l'homme ...Are your chats appropriate amongst civilised people? @Fils de l'homme ...And how did they miss you? hahahahahaha @Fils de l'homme ....Have u tried being a comedian in a barber shop. It might work @Fils de l'homme ...It also seems that my ancestors dropped you on your head 2 minutes after you was born. The effects are showing now @Fils de l'homme ...We are very proud of you. It seems that you are not and frustrated. Please be respectful or I will start to blame your parents for raising you so badly. @Fils de l'homme ......Where is your parents right now? put them on the line so I can chat with them about something UNIMPORTANT. Yoooooooou @Danie Nilsen ...It is very possible...if your wife never stops talking about it.....hehehehehe @Fils de l'homme ..You have been missing for a while...Was mummy changing your nappies again? @Fils de l'homme ..Yes we need to...But we need someone intelligent to run it dont you think? Can I be your leader? @Salmaan Abrahams ...He is actually sitting in a classroom battling to get past grade 2 it seems @redriger ...Driving taxis maybe @Gee Peex1 Morning friend @Gee Peex1 ...We missed you while you had gone MIA. My Precious friend @Jacqui Baumgardt ....And why have you gone missing as well? welcome back Precious Jacqui. We all love you tooooooo Oh no Jacqui. Are you okay my friend? I will commit you to Prayer my friend. I am saddened but will thank the Lord for your wellbeing @Jacqui Baumgardt @Jacqui Baumgardt ...Alister Chabi...the 1064 locomotive issue @redriger ...I see you left out the Pastors from your list... tooo many of them friend. @Brendan Rampath ...It has now become a jailable offence to lie about qualifications. @Brendan Rampath ...The wheels have started to turn. Very soon big things will happen. Absolutely @Brendan Rampath "Malema seems to get charged every day @Brendan Rampath ...He was here 2 months ago "You didnt miss much Brendan. A few coughs @Elvis Malakoane ...You are right bro. He did say that. @redriger ...What control? The police are selling guns for R200 each and R20 per bullet. No control there friend @Elvis Malakoane ...Tolerance is anongst one of the fundamental traits that Julius doe not possess. @Elvis Malakoane ...After the recent revelations it has now changed to C.I.T a.k.a COMMANDER IN THIEF i think "@MSG Rules ....That seems to be the rumour doing the rounds. He was top of the class during his training despite the earlier ""f"" in woodwork." @MSG Rules ...Sadly for our poor people. The VBS saga does change the status quo somewhat. Does not sound like rumours anymore @MSG Rules ...Its the new norm. Just look around and see our many Pastors have become wolves. It makes it easier to be a political wolf at times. Deeply saddening "@redriger ...Now that we know what ETC means @Brendan Rampath ...Brilliant....lets find a few more @Brendan Rampath ...Are you trying to impress me with your 5 Degrees bro. Well you succeeded. Brilliant again. @musawenkosi musa ....hehehehehehehe @Brendan Rampath ...But they cannot charge him for that. It is always blanks...hahahaha
