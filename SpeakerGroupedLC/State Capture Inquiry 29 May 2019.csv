Thembisa Odendaal,Anyone who wears a bow tie for this kind of gathering is beyond vain...so embarrassing they can't even act serious...even serial killers dress appropriately Sorry guys this is making me physically ill to see this incompetence
Peet Venter,Haibo Thembisa! @SABC DIGITAL NEWS are you aware of the problem?
Nelson Musoliwa,If Brian molefe is counted among the so called Black excellence then it will need re defining Still remember how Ben Ngubane was so furious about former PP Thuli report on state capture the day Brian Molefe cried in public saying the PP will be responsible if Eskom looses Molefe. Sabotage perhaps how can it take so long to fix the sound
