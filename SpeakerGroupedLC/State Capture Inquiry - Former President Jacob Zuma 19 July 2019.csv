Alasdair Knox,I hope he doesn't run to the shower today and quit testifying "so they say question is more importantly will he stay on today... this will be short I'm guessing start here finish on PP yay action audio
Jngle Pssy,today is the day... but.shouldn't he be made to.come Monday as well? seeing he missed one day lol I.dont know which one to watch !!! why can't Zuma just follow the work of the state capture like all the other witnesses... yes proceed Mr Pretorius they basically got nothing out of Zuma Johnny cash you so right so Zuma will.not continue... this is going to make South Africa fall "if this commission doesnt subpoena Zuma we need CJ Moegoeng Moegoeng to take this on! Zuma wont be let free.just like that hahaha just watch... send Zuma to ICC ICC intervene wow they going to the courts international criminal court intervene! south Africa is a mess I think Zuma knows he is guilty here your Zuma will fall hahahah Zuma is the most ugliest South African president ive ever seen south africa is disappointed south Africa is disappointed only Ramaphosa can change the rules of this commission compell Zuma yes hmmmm !!👌😁😁 zondo speaking the truth
Derek Main,Is the coward going to pitch today? The coward is back. @Musa Bakiti Wishful thinking - he's digging his own grave. So apparently the ANC is debating whether Zuma is the real impimpi. Is Zuma the real impimpi? @Adam Maseko Zuma the impimpi. Coward "Subpoena Zuma and hen when he refuses @Masilakhe Sineyi Don't tell me you believe those BS conspiracy theories. @Musa Bakiti Zuma the coward. Is he the real impimpi. @Masilakhe Sineyi I don't believe one word the liar Zuma says. @Lea Van Rensburg Yep - same old Stalingrad strategy. @Kabelo Katjedi This commission was set up to determine the truth. Zuma doesn't want the truth to come out because he is as guilty as sin. @Masilakhe Sineyi Ooooh - is that the best you can do? @Kabelo Katjedi We all know he is the king of corruption - we've known that for years now. He's just a coward. Coward @carnoth ngomane For now... He must be subpoenaed and then arrested when he refuses. Easiest way to get him in jail. @Kabelo Katjedi Zuma enabled all that stealing. He was president and bears ultimate responsibility. You'd think he'd want to put his sdie to clear his name but he's a coward. Run coward run Zuma the impimpi is doing a runner Comrat Zuma is a coward Zuma running like a dog. @Thebe Mokoena Zuma - he's a coward @Luvuyo Abraham Handsome like a butternut. Zuma gives amaZula a bad name. "@Gibson Ndlovu If you call running with your tail between your legs not losing @Musa Bakiti No respect for criminals - no matter how old they are. Zuma has got no balls. @Musa Bakiti Except criminals - they deserve no respect. @Phathisani Nkomo Yes there is. He's a gangster who sold out SA to the Guptas. @Siyabonga Magwaza This is not over - it's just getting started. Zuma is digging himself a hole. @Siyabonga Magwaza The sooner the better. @Bongani Zondo Zuma is running like a coward - how is that winning? @Gerald Beukes You set your standards too low.
Gen Jackson,PP is releasing Bosasa and another Pravin Report in a few minnutes Commission should subpoena Zuma again on condition that he's cross examined None of the previous witness has ever been cross examined Pretorius didn't do anything with Pravin.. This is UNFAIR Zondo is compromised. Chief Justice should intervene If only the commission had let cross examination be done in the past with other witnesses then this would not have happened Zondo made this whole thing political If only he had let others cross examine witness Commission is compromised Zondo set a precedent when he denied others to cross examine witnesses and now they want to do it on Zuma You should have let Moyane cross examine Jamnadas Pretorius failed to ask Jamnadas questions Is it only me who's not following what this guy is up to You didn't cross examine other witnesses But last time Pretorius told the commission he's not cross examining Zuma. Now the guy has cahnged his position Invite Zuma on cross examination grounds.. But htis of no rules is unfair Pretorius has an agenda to fail Zuma here. He didn't do the same on Pravin Invite Zuma on proper grounds Pertorius has spoilt this commission. He's biassed Commission should invite Rupert and Apartheid criminals Accept that you've treated Zuma unfairly Ramaphosa is also a constitutional delinquent Zondo you brought all this to yourself when you denied others to cross examine witnesses Zondo you brought this to yourself when you denied others to cross examine witnesses Ramaphosa's troubles have just begun Zondo you brought this to yourself when you denied others to cross examine witnesses Evidence leader Pretorius is biased Zondo you said this week that you've been writing commission letters.. Now you not aware of the Wednesday Letter. Commission si compromised Zondo you said this week that you've been writing commission letters.. Now you not aware of the Wednesday Letter. Commission is compromised Ramaphosa misled Parly Zondo you said this week that you've been writing commission letters.. Now you not aware of the Wednesday Letter. Commission si compromised Bravo Sikhakhane Black Excellence - Sikhakhane Zondo is unware of that letter yet he told us he's been writing letters Pretorius is biased and compromised Bravo Sikhakhane Pretorius SIT DOWN Zondo is rigth about that LETTER.
Villa,sesilindile sound? I can't wait to hear what Masuku and Skhakhane have prepared nazo! Skhakhane The Great! Skhakhane 🔥🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭 kgosi Mampuru prison without a process 😂😂😂 "hahaha Nazo "but y'all haven't heard his side of the story lol 😂😂😂😂 hlala phansi Pretorius 😂😂😂
LOGINS,tate zuma kuna kunya lets start zuma with this flu...drinking water there we go...
Born free,Legal Experts have stated that there is nothing wrong with Advocates line of questioning. Zuma is undeniably the most Uncredible Witness in my opinion. Zuma and his legal team will not control this commission of enquiry. Was it Duduzane who introduced the Guptas to Zuma or was it Zuma who introduced Duduzane to the Guptas? Issue that Supbeona now Zuma is the Kingpin and Key of State capture please Supbeona him now! If Zuma does not willingly appear he will be supeoned. The Zulu has cost this country billions and continues to to do so.. A Faction of the ANC and Malema helped this fool Zuma into power The criminal ex head of state. Zuma deserves no preferential treatment Black Laws are the same as white rules typed in Black on white paper Tyzer Zuma Zuma is and was always an embarrassment as a President. A soldier 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 Tell the truth Zuma you coward 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Have some KFC you will feel the truth Viva advocate Pretorius Many Presidents in the world have been jailed for corruption. Why do Klerk he sold the country down the drain Malema and the EFF are just plain delinquents. Africa is a mess The law will prevail Zuma is a dunce Zuma the dumbest ever Zumas supporters are simple and uneducated The Public Protector will find Zuma in breach of withdrawal from the Enquiry But Zuma can't answer questions they have to be broken down for his simple mind. Zumas lawyers trying to undermine the commission Zumas attorneys not credible The simple minds support Zuma Following.. really
rosalind gerber,why has Zuma been invited and not subpoenaed? @Gen Jackson all the others provided statements
André du Plessis,did someone bring the “Neuralyzer” you know that flashy thing from Men In Black? well someone must remember to flash Jacob again...

Kabelo Katjedi,Pretorious should just play easy or else Zuma will be asked to be excused frm the commission and nobody will stop him "I dont take statement made by former sacked ministers very serious Zuma is much intelligent twice better than those which degrees and phd's The fact that 1 man sold a country of over 50 million people just proved that Hate him as much as u want bt Sikhakhane is the best advocate "Who said Zuma is running "I couldn't agree with Sikhakhane  "This commission even the courts wont tell Zuma what to do "Why keep on saying he is a coward "Derek "Derek r u saying the man stole from a country over 50 million without anyone noticing "My point Xx but we decide to blame Zuma for everything happened even before 2009 "Sikhakhane u may nt be famous to those dnt knw u bt u r the best "Lets adjourn the proceeding until Zuma decide otherwise Zuma is already old so he will get a parol within 2 months.He will demand to die in front of his wives and kids "Zuma gave u the answers u demanded "U cnt compare the statements made by this 2 advs since well they perform different duties He might be forced to testify bt expect' i cnt recall the whole day' bathathe moprofeta Sikkhakhane "MR Pretorius undremines black advocate thinking he is better This 2 are here to settle the score Pretorious and Sikhakhane r performing 2 different duties so cnt compare their intelligence .The one who is in defend will always b looked like a bully
Kevin Simon,Expecting LOTS of objections American style 5th amendment... Stalingrad III. Wait for the subpoena now.

#dm70,This commission will get nothing out of Zuma. He is very careful not to implicate himself. "Questions that lead to him implicating himself will definitely get an ""I don't know answer"". They can't force him to give them what they want 2 hear I think it will be a very wrong choice for Zuma not to give his version of events as then all raised by witnesses render him guilty of commission

Andrew Peters,Well no surprises at all. The real problem is that the questions are exposing the truth Will Zondo continue after all this ? But that is not the problem. The problem is that Zuma cannot hide very much with the questions Obviously Zuma is hiding heap loads of info inspite of not understanding much he's struggling to keep calm isn't this turning into an embarresment since the whole commission is HOLDING ITSELF on trial ! Zondo Commission holding ITSELF as witness. What a shambles
Mcoseleli Matshaya,Ladies and Gentlemen! What is your input since you heard from the horses mouth that he's not continuing with the enquiry? I've just read an article which was hailing Zuma for returning as a leader... The judge is clearly disappointed by today's proceedings....

We say AMAHLATHI APHELILE" remember Michael Hulley used Zuma to chow our money Dump him Zuma thinks is over the law
Mandla Ntshalintshali,Appearing before the Commission is voluntary. So if former President leaves on his volition let him leave. "...and if the former President doesn't finish his submissions as he agreed to appear and because of what has come up linking him I don't feel Sikhakhane is representing the former President well. he relies on emotive arguments instead of fact... Sikhakhane is already implying his client shall be taken to prison....🤷‍♂️...how does he arrive at that? "Sikhakhane Sikhakhane what is the meaning of incompetent vs inefficiency? Zondo and his team have nothing to lose. But the former President has something to lose depending on what transpires. Public opinion is focussing on how they conduct themselves. Are they convincing?
