Lindani Lushaba,@Paula Cooke okay no problem @Tickle McVetkoek I think he got confused by your question
Victor,mr Burger has collapsed Policy stands at #1 but mr Burger has a point @Lerato Moleke Heehehehehe mr Burger's frustration against LNT was genuine. he is just defeated by the Policy issue No DCJ bidder will not tell us what to do with the winner "Against set policy mr Burger has a point "If they had gone for LNT and things went bad as it is Guys dont you think the situation have been worse off if they had gone for LNT (# 2) and things went wrong? ***would "@Willie-Johan Prosser exactly putting other fact aside What happened to him? He was ok all along AT CEO leve is not expected Bully bosses lack principles At Denel they behaved as they wanted and hence the politically connected took adavantage @Yolo More Policies were never important for real
Mzalwane Mzala,ANC 72.9% Yep. Overall percentage in the 96% by-elections held yesterday. The IEC has issued the report @MARLON OOSTHUIZEN DA 16.6% IFP 5.2% FF+ 1% Patriotic Alliance 1% Al Jama-ah 1% EFF does not even appear on the scoreboard ANC won 72.9% according to my calculations but the party claims 73.6% I could be missing something. You're welcome @Nemabubuni Geoffrey @Angelo Doubel I also think the people are responding to CR's leadership as in the last test of electoral support at local government level the ANC got only 53%. "More than anything "The DA has learnt many lessons of its poor handling of these events @Tickle McVetkoek ✋ @Pastor J.J Thanks for the kind words. I am merely quoting the DA's justification for their loss for now. ". However "Shortly "@Megan Diedericks They blame the mishandling of Schweizer Reineke and Patricia de Lille issue They say they have learnt lessons and will correct such things I don't know how their loss to the FF+ can be explained as 'identity politics'. @Tickle McVetkoek Numbers don't lie. DA is the only party that had a net loss of 7 wards yesterday. @Robert Malan You and your family just secede The fact that the EFF did not win a ward should not a shock to an ardent observer of South African politics. The EFF have consistently grown its footprint without winning wards since its formation. Almost all EFF councilors come from the Party Representative (PR) list. I can only think of about 2 wards in the NW that the EFF won and nothing more but it still grows.

David Tuer,I think now Adv Kennady (and DCJ) are talking from an ivory tower. The arms industry is a very messy business. If you're going to be in it you will get your hands dirty. Teunis van Ree I think you're right. I suspect he was so upset by what he saw as his treatment by Denel that he lost his sense of perspective and was easy meat for the Guptas.
Angelo Doubel,@Thabo Mokoaleli 🤣🤣🤣 @Russia Magezi 🤣🤣🤣 @Mzalwane Mzale I think the people has confedence in the leadership of CR17 We need the EEF be watchdogs over the ANC. @Yolo More 🤣🤣🤣 @Mzalwane Mzale CR17 is the man.

Dominic Przybylski,"Municipal elections are to vote for somebody who represents the inhabitants of a ward. The political parties represent their party bosses @Megan Diedericks Unfortunately DA took their supporters for granted. They neglected their principles in their hunt for power. That's where Mmusi failed them. "@Megan Diedericks They've milked the ratepayers in Cape Town It was pure hypocracy. All politicians are seduced by power and money regardless whether they are ANC DA or EFF. Power corrupts. That's why we should never vote same parties in for more than two elections. @Smart Guys EFF can't fall very far if they can only crawl. They're just a bunch of crooks pretending to be 'freedom fighters'. I think it's about 15 years since I had cheese cake. Is this a dating site?

Freddie Van Rhyn,when the ANC provincial administrators took over the Tswane from the DA in an illegal take over earlier this year the city of Tswane had a R429 million surplus. since the DA got the city back through the high Court they found a R 4.4 billion deficit in Tswane Phillip cwasibe that is how ANC runs a city or a country into the ground because of appointing incompetent people The south african high commissioner in Los Angeles refuses 30 properties offered to her. she wants to occupy a property on Rodeo drive and have all brand new cupboards and furniture from the east All EFF knows how to do is to disrupt and vandalize. what happened to the tractors that EFF donated to 2comunities
