Gabisile Mabuza,how convenient for mr Majola to fall ill
Ishaad Mohammed,he is pulling a Zuma
Erika Bown,@Gabisile Mabuza stress.... He knows whats coming His stomach is probably also running ha ha ha They can't run/hide or be sick forever though Agreed! @Pheladi Lamola I was thinking the same thing.. Mr x was doing so well.... Now they'll start to question his credibility 😕 It does require account holder "And if the account holder and account nr don't match you won't be able to pay "@Musa Mabunda ok "Ah ok @Brian Mercado my thoughts exactly! "But anyway @cassim suleman And so is DUDU!!! "Mmmm.... Sounds a bit dodgy now. First he does remember (yesterday) I sincerely hope it is that. We need him to be truthful so these people don't find any loopholes You don't have to be educated to remember what you said yesterday and say now today... We are all thankful Mr x "No
Lorna Kavanagh,Every one seems to fall ill when they come under the spotlight. Yes Mr X needs to be applauded for his courage
Jacqui Baumgardt,Hidehodee all I'd also be feeling very ill @Moshoeu Mabusela - she's dodging everything @ERika unless they die the name of the holder the number - at least that's what I need my bank won't accept that @Musa Mabunda - they reject the transaction the name and the number must stack up
Sherwin Peters,Majola running afraid 🤣🤣🤣
Pheladi Lamola,What's this about Mr Majola being ill? What happened? I'm confused. When doing transfers don't we put in account holder and number? 🤣🤣🤣 Mr X Yes it does require both Thalente insists Isibonelo did some work but doesn't have a record of what work was done. Go figure. SABC stop it. You're hurting our ears I think it's nerves Erika. But man was gullible really I'm scared for him too when I think of the political killings in KZN. JZ and his ilk will not leave him alone He's scared shame. Pleading with his community
Moshoeu Mabusela,Dudu myeni will report sick also. thieves SAA evidence is still coming also for her. shame
Buhle Guluva,r we still busy with mr x? mr x is volumeless today or its me? whos empty chair? no chairman? it means no interuption thanks
Jie Hamilton,and then she's gets defensive by information from Rose's head brain talk way
Didi Motshaba-Monchusi,mr x
CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,No shame. They're just having fruits of their deeds Camera person and the empty chair😂😂 @Buhle Mr Xs chair "Excuse my poverty I should have worked for Mr X. I would be rich but not under the radar😋😋😋 I've also never done internet transfers. Does it require the account holder as well? Or the account number only? @Erika Bown Tx "@Musa Mabunda So it's possible that Mr Xs secretary could transfer the money without the account holder's details "@Brian Mercado He relied on his secretary JZ is very clever. No trace of him receiving any money...a great chess move👏👏👏 "@Elvis Malakoane Yes "@makhosi nobhatyi But her being the chair of the foundation is not evidence that he received cash. That we know from conventional wisdom That JZF must be investigated
Colleen Arezio,"Buhle Now all the volume is off. "Majola maybe they do transfers like they do in Zim through your phone with only your cell number. Mr X knows more than his saying. Nobody can have millions come and go from account not get paid and still you dont care to know anything about the sender or beneficiary. Something fishy. did write the conversation down and leave the transcript at office. his hiding.
Wildthing,Mr X he cried himself into dehydration status. They will retrieve the SMS's and maybe he kept all the notes he took. judge just hit nail on the head with the hammer. maybe the secretary had a list to match account holder to account number. and would use that. she must know a lot too. he would also be making interest depending how long the funds stayed in his account. Think other people will come forward now that Mr x has given evidence opening a whole can of worms Elvis not thanks I like to sleep well at night knowing I have not robbed from others. Thanks many dots joined today. Judge is linking dots 👏👏👏👏👏👏🤝🤝 he has the Zuma bug. sickashell bye bye all
Pastor J.J,Is Majola still around or has he run off?
Gerda 7,X Y and Z Mr X was only the puppet of many strings!!
Person of interest,Lol Michael😁 We learned alot from the USA system!
Immanuel,jz foundation😳😳😳😳😳😳
Derek Main,JZ Foundation as corrupt as the Clinton Foundation. @Elvis Malakoane Not only JZ a crook - he's a coward too. @cassim suleman Exactly - the big guys don't have to follow the same rules we ordinary mortals do. "Laws
Simphiwo Matiso,hmmmm lying yhoo lies are not permanent
Legae Nyalungu,secretary and daughter must be summoned ASAP
Musa Mabunda,@CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE you can put anything on the account holder @Erika Bown not necessarily "You can link two accounts "the system will merely alert you the account number already exists on your beneficiaries' ist @CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE details that matter is the account number hence you can also transfers money by a cellphone number linked to the account number "@Luegi Msomi it is painful indeed "@cassim suleman true @Clantonaqua he's some sort of Section 204 if you are au fait with the criminal procedure law "@CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE not that simple @Clantonaqua i was merely commenting on that observation "@Jacqui Baumgardt name of holder you can put anything "@Jacqui Baumgardt names can change anytime "The problem is we don't arrest
Simon Tshifhiwa Nkhumeleni,zuma name is always mention when money disappear JGZF
makhosi nobhatyi,"They share stolen money Zuma and Myeni was destroying mr X career and company by using his company to do money laundering 😳😳😳 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ Zuma is evil @ Matt Tylor no one should go to support him to the court otherwise something will happen Zuma was enriching himself over our struggles "@Christopher Molefe there is Painful painful and sadness 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ please remove mr x Majola took unadvantage of uneducated person Mr X was going to be arrested for money he didn’t used Protection please DCJ give mr x For how long?

Brian Mercado,"It’s amazing how Mr. X is in charge of so much money "Well if you rely on your daughter He might leave with your cutlery Yes my bank also rejects
Luegi Msomi,"Mr X better have some protection because inKZN

Clarah Ntombela,"shocking 
Clantonaqua,"MrX. u took your share too. R1.15 m in @Musa . it was just an observation @Musa Mabunda . Sure

Smart Guys,arrest didi immediately dudu JZF involved in money laundering viva Mr X
Sold Not,brudda osas awewewewe
Werner Bredenkamp,he cant even listen properly to what is asked from Zondo...he did not ask what cell number was used....They play in circles like every other person involved why protection if he did not do what was right in the begin? should have spilled the beans. They brought that apon themselves so they in all fairness take what comes with the situation.
Anne M.,@makhosi nobhatyi Witness protection is being provided @makhosi nobhatyi I don't know. I don't think the death threats are going away any time soon. "@Vish Govender No

Peter Sant,maybe the job was beyond his ability thanks Mr x
Dave Thorstry,"X appears to be sharp and with it
Tommygun,Ive just worked out whats up with the auto translate 😃
Zay Sewram,😂
Charlene Botha,Shocker......
Annie Van Niekerk,Thank you Mr X
Karin Snyman,such a brave man. should receive a medal. proud of being a South African.
Vish Govender,Now that he has testified he should be safe because those implicated well be the first suspects and they would be wary not to aggravate their situation Very true Anne but the supporter will be careful so that those they support dont get arrested
Jane .Blamire,We always knew they up to their ears in corruption along with many others. Just needed all this proof for the courts Check all flights to Dubai tonight!!!! Or Cuba
Sibusiso Mthokozisi Dubazana,So no Mr Majola?
