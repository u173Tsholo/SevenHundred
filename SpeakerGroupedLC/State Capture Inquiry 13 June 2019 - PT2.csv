DJ DJ,who is speaking now no arrests will be made like all other problems truth is so much money is been spent on this commision but yet no-one has been arrested. Is it actually worth it as we all know the truth @Suzanne Saunders i did not vote for the ANC
Ngaletsang Mayet,lot of people in SAA has eaten tax payer s monies Correct Born free its bad that some employees at SAA were given retrenchments packages while politicians are chowing the monies Yes Suzanne those who tried eventually resigned leaving the poor SAA to the hands of looters Indeed our infrastructure is collapsing while billions are spend on these SOE s
Born free,"Yes The Guptas had the government in their pockets which led to the enabling and looting of State funds. There are more fools out there than there are wise men. This level of corruption has nothing to do with Apartheid but everything to do with Incompetence and greed and a culture of greed. Apartheid remains only with the guilty. Move forward it is nothing but a word of obstruction.. After 25 years you finally decide to find new experiences. You only live once.. move forward it will lead to progress. some people cannot escape their own mental slavery. " In 25 years I have only seen how flawed the ANC is. Yes @ Clive.. Captains of Incompetence ANC is united in incompetence yes of course the Guptas Let's hope so Muriel.. let's hope that the commission does it's job and all assets acquired by the looting of the public purse.. Will be returned to the public purse. well done Don
makhosi nobhatyi,Surely we will see people prostituted towards the end of commission NPA is busy now compiling all evidence they might collect and carry on with more investigation to charge those executives and politicians "@suzanne saunders she tried but her voice was ignored "This commission is different with others that was held before @Moahi hlapolos yes that happened before but this time around things will change those people who have given authority to act law push them to do so. That is why parliament will be investigated "@Derek main I am pleading you to watch "@Derek main your concern is everyone concerned but we have hope in this administration "There is a hope in this administration "Only one problem I have now Mkhwebane seems she is working for an agent so I don‚Äôt trust her she failed twice in her report "@Derek main people protest is our rights to demand these services so that government may improve it ANC government is working hard to improve the lives of the poor and better life for all üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è@Norman Zwane this idiocy must stop sending us Chinese
Derek Main,They've already prostituted themselves. @Born free Yes - our elections proved that. @Norman Zwane Perhaps but I base that on the fact the we have heard of all the ANC corruption and the fools still voted for them. It's not just a thumbsuck or guess - it has been laid bare. Only the ANC fools can't see it. "@Norman Zwane Totally agree with that - they supported the Nats to the end. So the more things change The ANC have become the Nats. @makhosi nobhatyi I would love to be able to do that - I just can't see it under an ANC government. @Norman Zwane We are all scarred by our lived experience in SA - some more than others. @makhosi nobhatyi Believe me I'll speak my mind. I just feel that we are just kicking the can down the road. "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU If you have a point to make @Norman Zwane That was the politetest word I could think of. @makhosi nobhatyi I'm afraid I don't have your optimism. The rot is too deep. @Norman Zwane What do you think I'm being sarcastic about? @Norman Zwane OK - please explain to me how people can riot in the streets against poor service delivery one day and the next vote for the very party failing at service delivery. That's a fool. @Norman Zwane Then they are even more foolish to think those are the only parties they could have voted for. "@makhosi nobhatyi That doesn't make any sense. Surely you vote for them because you think they are capable of delivering. If they fail @Norman Zwane I can definitely see that it messed with education. @Norman Zwane I agree with you - and the ANC are taking full advantage of that. @Norman Zwane Take a look at the education system now. Is it better? @Norman Zwane I've tried many routes to convince people - I've given up with that. Now I just say it like I see it. @Norman Zwane Don't entertain the trolls @clive oconnell The catholics are no innocents but that's an argument for another day. @Muriel Haynes He /she will have to come and testify about that.
Suzanne,"this poor woman tried everything she could to save money and protect SAA As citizens in this country we need to keep fighting this anti corruption fight... billions and billions of rands! "This makes me so angry Thats why i am saying... we as citizens should support these people who fight. @makhosi nobhatyi we should help these people. help them fight what they do here is so scary and big "@DJ DJ you can vote for someone else who wont have this power hungry disgusting attitude... and i dont mean a political party. they are all useless Tea time is done... back to work for me üòû Neither did i... If we know who funds political parties do you think that it would make a difference? Would you still buy a luxury german car if you know they had given cars to the parliament for something? "At least people can now see and understand the extent of madness we have been subject to in the last few years. We need to become an educated country and we need to teach ourselves What i can add is that i am always so happy to see people who fight. These whistle-blowers and people like Thuli Madonsela have my utmost respect. These are the bravest people i know! @Norman Zwane why cant you teach people? "Apartheid didnt leave anyone unscathed. My dad was stabbed by a protester in 1977 while he was teaching in JHB De Korte street "I still have hope in Ramaphosa Well perhaps its time to find new experiences... I still have hope in SA - even though we have had a tough past. but you cant move forward if the past hangs like a heavy horrid stone around your neck. @Born free its never to late. @Norman Zwane i know exactly what you mean. I also have experiences. I think everyone has. Thats what makes this reconciliation so hard. "@Norman Zwane not a diamond ok ok ok back to work now. whahahah
Sibulelo Marabela,hey mzatsi is very hard here in south afrika
Kay Kay,guys don't lose hope let's trust that DCJ Zondo will help all of us by recommending prosecution of those who looted the country "Amen Nkosi DCJ Zondo is clever he ordered parly to be investigated knowing that by the time his report arrive there isn't watered down
Amen Nkosi,i dont think that these commission will help ...
Norman Zwane,@Derek Main I doubt that is exclusive derek because on either side of the party divide is a similar sentiment. Maybe both sides can be true simultaneously. @Suzanne Saunders You'll be amazed how slow to learn people can be. we lived with a mad apartheid system for decades but there are adults who still have no idea how it damaged everyone. But I see "@Derek Main Yeah. we all take long to learn. Imagine after the Un declared apartheid a crime against humanity and some blunt knives still voted to uphold its proponents @Suzanne Saunders Taught experience is trumped by lived experience. Personally my lived experience is to be weary of being in agreement with folks who are not Black. @Born free You sure lived on the 'other side of the track'. @Suzanne Saunders Big gamble for me. I have a baggage of experience versus a glimpse of hope. The dice is loaded in favour of my lived experience. wish it was easy to move on. "@Suzanne Saunders It don't hang like some diamond stone on my neck @Derek Main from scared to scarred when we start throwing F words around (Fools in your case) "@Suzanne Saunders I hate to agree with you "@Derek Main If you are being honest & not sacarstic then I'm afraid you come across as insensitive "@Derek Main Your application of the word ""FOOLISH"". I doubt that you intended to use it in politenes as you sacarstically claim." @Sthakathi Khumalo 3 Cheers. Umbonile!! "@Derek Main well you are correct again @Derek Main education? What education? as far as apartheid was concerned we should only have learnt how to take instructions - period. @Don Johnson Now that slavery is abolished - yes "@Derek Main If I was the ANC I would too @Don Johnson Lucky fish. In that case are the slaves worth nothing then? "@Derek Main The education @Derek Main well just dont typically give up and join them. we row against the current for our own sanity because the ANC & its cronies are a cancer that will destroy us all in the end. "@Anne M. Please do not chase @Don Johnson away. He gives me balance "@Don Johnson Personally I'm no keen athelete "@Derek Main I think I took the bait there @Sthakathi Khumalo Inakhunja leyo ifuna ukhwife kuqala izoqonda.
