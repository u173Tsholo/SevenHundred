Aubrey De Bliquy,What happened? @Santa Kriel Welcome. No need to feed enmity for no reason. We are one planet finding away to live in harmony. Wa jus saying before the wheels fell of I never believed this scripted pandemic from WHO for one second and the slightest research confirms my opinion. WHO changed their procedures in 2009 to allow them to decree a pandemic without due scientific process. @Santa Kriel Laughter is the best medicine but It's a poison when the joke is on us. "The young ones Liberty or death. fv<# this scam panicdemic of stupid. @Santa Kriel better debating issues than defering to arbitrary self proclaimed authority like Fauci and WHO? Can someone explain why i is ncessary for a party in power with a majority to change law needs to break law to deliver services? (slow mode is on) so slow monitors can keep track of the conversation they want to control. "@Rob Yes @ALTA me too. BRB coffee break. @ALTA I am not sure if Youtube or SABC initiates Slow Mode. @Naledi Barron Everyone is on the YT chat here. I was just wondering if SABC or YOutube controls the Slow Mode feature which I have seen before. and why? "Hmm Google and no doubt now controlled by entities in the permanent state oligarchy. Any news on the consitutional court urgent hearing to oblige Mr Zuma to testify like every South African called upon is obliged to testify? Why does a government with a majority to change laws have to break laws to deliver services? Incompetence? Greed? Betrayal? @Rahab Takalo I doubt the court will not agree with Zondo. This is not even a grey area. It is clear Zuma did not even present a case for recusal. Sounds like a criminal conspiracy to steal from South Africans got busted wide open. I C U @Roza E hy would people thinkj the EF would be any better? Juju used his base to elect Zuma and then to bring him down. How is he to be trusted as more than just another self serving parasite? "@Minnib Prince they have no money to give back @3RDCREWTEK be patient you may get your wish. @bongile sango I know the DA is as expedient as all politicians with perhaps a little more style. I certainy do not trust their policies as adequate to our challenges. We have more than enough competent and qualified black people with the necessary integrity and moral fortitude but they are not welcome in the centers of power. Where is their political home? It seems we are now getting the forensic experts and the cream of the crop of advocates. "@Naledi Barron in 2016 when Hillary said I beg your pardon ANC is supposed to be te home of the Freedom Charter. We want our home back. and the land which is our birthright as South Africans. @Kopz Koape Our constitution is supposed to be a fulfilment of the Freedom Charter. That ideal is still to be realized. Us mean all of us. I do not subscribe to te fantasy of group guilt or group pprosperity. We are one nation. We swim or sink together. United we stand. Divided we fall. @Kopz Koape Exactly. If we have no borders we have no country. @Kopz Koape Yes. If 1000 pupils enter the borders there must be two extra schools for their pupils if they are not to be second class ciizens without the right to education we all have. @Kopz Koape as long as there is no bribery to allow people to buy their way into the country ... but I guess that applies to all borders. THe immigration authorities need to be fixed. @Kopz Koape Wise leadership is so vital. @Kauju Mwakajumba That makes sense. @Dominic Przybylski 100% No matter the credentials of the authority. Trust but verify. @Heather Durr Isn't not doing audits more expensive in the long run? @Kauju Mwakajumba No doubt about it. We are very blessed in this country if only we can put our best in power to deliver for everyone. Yes we can. (sorry bama gave that a bad name) Wars will end when people refuse to fight one another and choose a better way. ❤ Am I the only onewho simply loes and admires COngresswoman from Hawaii Major Tulsi Gabbard. She would have made the best president ever but they shafted her for. We ned to find our own perfect President. How about Zondo? "Welcome @Kauju Mwakajumba I also think its better. Not perfect @Kauju Mwakajumba Just keep the ones who are not corrupt to choose who to replace the corrupt ones. @Yolo More I am sure there are many Zondo's around with a sense of patriotism and faithful to the country. @Kauju Mwakajumba ot a pastor. That was a fancy dress on my facebook page. LOL lots of eople ask that. But I am profoundly spiritual. I don't like religious fundamentalism detached from reality. @Phakamile Khuzwayo 100% the race thing is like all group guilt and division the oldest tool of scoundrels and tyrants designed to make us all weak and dependent. We unite and watch devils tremble. @Kopz Koape Trump is awful but voers voted against Hillary and imho biden and Kamala are even more disgusting. They started redefining the meaning and purpise of Exit polling in 2016 already because they eposed their election rigging fraud. "No USA is more captured by the Military industrial congressional complex to levels of sophistication Zuma could only dream of. It is not just a failed state but a rogue state and a dangerous one. @Kopz Koape I fully endorse his attemot to expose the fraud no matter his success or failure even while I strongly oppose his politics. It is a principle. We are ruled by law or the jungle. @Heather Durr Which founder of the intercept do you refer to? Glen Greenwald who recntly resigned when they censored him? Nikki Haley is awesome. I have seen her before. another rare gem. OK I will try refresh At last i got the video feed back @Kopz Koape Im sure its not the stripper. LOL she is a governor The epic nature of these revelations belies the calmness of their delivery. We need to elect legislators and not parties who simply nominate legislators. @Kopz Koape Who is Action SA? @Kopz Koape Thank you. I will certainly find out abut Herman Mashaba's new party. Is he peddling racism like the rest of the losers? 10 g'nite all and sweet drams.

Santa Kriel,@Aubrey de Bliquy ever heard of the concept of humor? try it. it will open up a whole new world @Aubrey De Bliquy i can see you like debating on issues (in my view not worth debating on). i once had a boyfriend like that. i always told him to drink a chill pill @Theunis van Ree i guess it is for slow people like me. maybe SABC got a request from others evidence leader giving the DCJ instructions. and he is obeying...

Should i ask them to change it again? hehehehehe "@Teunis van Ree That was the Grade 6 class entertaining us this morning. Nothing to do with Mr Blunt ""not so sharp"" Blade" @Dominic Przybylski The Dating in the chat was being run as a side bus for a fee. Now that you have given it prominence you have denied @Valencia J and the A Team of our only source of income. hahaha @Roza E Greetings prettiest one @Roza E You too my Bestie @Sal SA Brilliant Bro. hahahahaha @Yolo More You see Darling @Yolo More sharp @SanFran Arnold I see you clearly with my old eyes Darling @Granny Mokwena absolutely 100%. @Granny Mokwena The same buggers that appeared at Treasury when Weekend Special was appointed Minister @Minnib Prince You could be right with Kakhuis Niehaus being in the same building @Heather Durr I think he does. I find him to be very articulate and intelligent I never cease to be amazed how people spend money on Data just to come on here and behave foolishly. Eish @Mbulelo Zitha May I ask. What has the ANC done for you and its people vs. what we hear they did for themselves? R617.77 someone has been looking at my bank statement it seems @Roza E Laher and Bobhat was the 2 that went to Treasury When Des Van Rooyen was appointed Minister of Finance for the dreaded weekend @Heather Durr They got paid for licences not delivered or wastefully delivered @Jenny B Yes my friend. I watched it again on Monday and noticed @Freddie Van Rhyn Very true @Aubrey De Bliquy How about me or you? hahahahaha @Sal SA Totally agree. She read from the Trump script. Nothing special really @Rory Lee Farnham Yoh. Thats Bad. I also remember saying many months back that a Radio Station didnt allow you on air as well. Bad stuff bro. Censorship you think? eNCA is broadcasting Bring Cloudy back @Anne M. Same one Refresh and the feed is fine @Anne M. Its a perfect match @Tommy Kernaghan Consider it done. While we at it we can also do the same for Parliament. Lots of crooks there too @Anne M. A Team for sure. We will feed the buggers boiled cabbages everyday We will hire 2 Chefs to boil the cabbages. Nothing difficult. Lets check with our girls on the team who can boil cabbages @SanFran Arnold you are hired. Go to Food Lovers tomorrow and start practicising Mr Van Coller knew a lot more than he revealed. Whilst his testimony was necessary it was also very incomplete and convenient. The scheduling is well planned and orchestrated @Sal SA @Roza E The ANC reminds me of cheating husbands @Lynn Barnard Did you work for an IT company?
TheQueen V,oh I notice if I send to fast after the first message it just sits in the air and doesn't post. sabc then you wonder about TV license payments 🥴 "@Teunis wat gaan aan they are censoring us so they can monitor our communication here. Why do we have to be slower and wait 31 seconds to send next message🙄 something sinister lurking. Can't keep up with the A-team 😂😂 2 million for conference venue 😲😲 I wonder how much goes to their pockets 🤔🤔 anc must go!!!!!! we can't afford those hyenas anymore apologies to all animals whom we dearly love 😥 they actually do have characteristics of hyenas. If you look at how easy hyenas can steal a meal from another predator which they did not work for or killed themselves and feast on it.. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ @Teunis I think they finally got the picture 😴😴😴😴😴 Sekhakane should learn a thing or two haibo

Heather Durr,Eventually found the correct stream How can people be so stupid leaving this Wizard of Oz road leading to them DCJ but does chair understand 'Freudian slip' They should do this for every company !!!!!!!! "@Kieron Sinewave You mean ENS-They were hired by EOH BUT we need a forensic audit on all SOE's that are raised here-it gives the answers  @Karen x Thanks-I just cannot get my mind around how much they paid for nothing-its mindblowing Yup block all who have a point to prove due to their own inferiority complexes @Karen x Awww all my dear friends :thanksdoc: @Minnib Prince 🙂 @Aubrey De Bliquy Why cant they do forensic audits for all the SOEs-should they not have started with that . Too expensive? @Aubrey De Bliquy Exactly. Maybe the Hawks do it as they decide if to prosecute or not my Kingdom for a full stop (period) @Aubrey De Bliquy She is very compelling. But Nikki Haley will be the first USA Pres I think "@Aubrey De Bliquy Google her - very attractive @Sal SA I agree totally-but country may be ready for a republican woman and she has experience. Give her 8/12 years *perpetuate @Aubrey De Bliquy Read the article by the founder of 'The Intercept' re Biden Hunter and Burissma @Aubrey De Bliquy Yes Glen - on that subject My stream is working perfectly now Nope still off I am utterly gobsmacked at the sheer audacity of this The witness is assisting the Evidence Leader. He is really bright😂 Cocaine smuggling
bongile sango,I wonder who is this person is going correct all these wrong doings from the ANC.Because it's clear now that everybody there is corrupt. This proves the smallanyana skeletons. exactly @Kgotso After this membership numbers are going to decrease 🤞 @Rahab 😂😂😂they can't be healthy at all I always asked my self how did they became a millionaire over a stipend they received from the party. Zizi Kodwa has been mentioned many times in this testimony This means next year there won't be any January 8. Because donations will be gone @Manelisi mnguni how do you know that DA is clean? @Aubrey I can understand if he says it's better than the others. because as a person who is staying in CT. things are coming too slow to my place. This is the reason our beloved country is on it's knees
Mboniseni Matodzi,I wish if zondo commission can stay forever and to investigate everything. it can play a role in order to reduce the corruption
Stand for Truth with Khustaz,@Valencia J as long as companies are benefiting ANC is sadly going nowhere. “Your in Democracy “ this my sign off in my e-mails 😀😀😀

"@Grant Herholdt It's a historical issue @Grant Herholdt Exactly!! And therin lay the opportunities for such graft and c orruption to have taken place over the last 15+ years! @Karen x Heather has been around on this forum for as long as many of us have. Her distinction is her career as a lawyer. So please wind it back? @Heather Durr NP Ha ha! The ANC Money-Go-Roundabout fame. *game 100% Agree Mr Powell!!
Dominic Przybylski,Chat is slowed to help us concentrate on the testimony instead of on comments of people who seem to treat this commission as a dating service. @Valencia J Look at the comments while listening to the testimony. It's clear that most commentators have very little interest in what the witness is saying. "@Sal SA I'm very chilled Normally only block eff trolls but experimented with blocking the dating agency small-talkers. Amazing how much space just a few of them took up. @Aubrey De Bliquy Unfortunately ideals are often confused with illusions. Even the powerful Soviet Union wasn't able to convert the illusion of the same ideal into a reality. If they failed what makes you think a small underdeveloped country like ours will succeed? """LAN and WAN"" gives as much detail as invoicing for ""IT"". There is no measurable deliverable." @Kopz Koape We need body cams on our politicians more urgently. @Kopz Koape Lol. No government anywhere would support political transparency. That's why it's so important to get Frog Boiler to sign the political party donation legislation into law. "@Kopz Koape South Africa is already a failed state. 5th most dangerous in the world @Kopz Koape I don't see when or how it can return to anything like success considering all circumstances. Our only hope is that the private sector will be able to keep the economy running. @Phakamile Khuzwayo The primary responsibilty of a government is to maintain law and order. Our government is a criminal syndicate. We don't have a real government. We have to survive without one. We're all boiled frogs of all races in the ANC potjie. @Phakamile Khuzwayo We have to rely on ourselves as individuals rather than be herded (as the masses) like cows towards an abbatoir. @Lerato Moleke Does the government give you food or is it your local supermarket? Think about it. A politician has no value in a government which doesn't work. It's up to us as individuals and as a nation to fix it. @Aubrey De Bliquy No such thing as a perfect president. You seem to have an affinity towards illusionary ideals. @Kauju Mwakajumba Only person you can trust is yourself... As long as you don't lie to yourself. Only prime minister who impresses me is Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand. ANC fools most people by using race to stay in power.

What are you talking about??? @Aubrey de Bliquy. The freedom charter does have flaws such as SA is for all who live in it . Illegal immigrants take advantage of that. "Im not against immigrants coming to SA Some foriegners can stay as long as they abide by law and do the right thing and contribute to economy by creating employment and investment @Aubrey De Bilquy..Im thinking perhaps the government should deploy soldiers to all the borders especially porous borders. Perhaps SANDF can establish barracks near borders and patrol borders "@Aubrey De Bliquy..I agree "@Antony and@ dominic. Yes "@Aubrey. I dont think ill see wise leadeship in this lifetime @Dominic.. Right corruption is everywhere but not like SA.

Canis Africanis,@Pastor J.J Niehaus is nie 'n kakhuis nie. "Yes Aubrey ...was.
Cain Chunda,"so all you minions who always say the corrupt is Zuma and the Guptas ANC is the home of thugs getting where Arnold?
Zweli Nkomo,how can we trust any led government by anc when members of its party seems to be so involved in dubious transactions between EOH and how the company looted the state
Nkosi Welcome,@Aubrey you want your apartheid back?
Kieron Sinewave,I wonder what the ratio is between actual corruption and just being bad at your job ... atm it seems most in this commission are both :{ @Heather Durr I had a look at this guys company website.. interesting stuff. did the commission hire them? @Heather Durr riiiiight what a coincidence 😆 Harris has prob been gunning for it low key her whole life
Karen x,Herman Mashabe is useless... he is just another politician... ex anc Heather you clearly not following the proceedings... just typing

Antony Goedhals,It is so wonderful to see Arthur Chaskalson's son continuing his father's services to SA - by helping DCJ Zondo to see the extent of the cancer in this land. Stength to them all - and thanks. @Kopz Koape that is a brilliant idea - they should do this with our cops and also with our civil servants.
Grant Herholdt,And people wonder why Joburg’s IT billing system is dysfunctional And since then neither SAP or EOH can fix it despite getting paid bajillions for doing just that. Why are people ANC directly ANC sending Joburg City contracts to EOH in return for donations. No services actually provided. Trips to NYC for Parks Tau and his wife.
g g,makhubo destroyed south Africa this people must be accountable individually not collectively true we need clean audit in all municipalities for us to be on the right direction I agree 😎
Fred Desrosiers,"Please do not accept the excuses the so called ""leaders"" are given. They were aware of the PFMA why is not one of them in jail?? "@Tongai Mupedzi "@Heather Durr
Sekoka Louis Mmako,this is scary

Mr L,"bomb after bomb after bomb and yet the ANC continues to win elections @Dominic sad but true "@Kauju Mwakajumba I agree "@Sekgome Kgame true "@Lee D Hendrix with the right amount of money "@Cooler cat...

Very few ""clean"" people in politics" @Lynn well basically yes not sure but Makhubo has ties to the company @ Cooler Cat
Kauju Mwakajumba,@Mr L. what I see the problem is there is no party which are serious for ruling SA I never think SA they are corrupt like this...I think SA is number one for corruption in Africa is a xeim DA was going a right direction until they started to mess up of removing black leaders For now as much as ANC are more corrupt i don’t see any party which is serious in SA Since constitution will be changed to individual to compitite as a president then that will be much better "@Aubrey De Bliquy that only the way this country can be fixed...there some individuals who clean like this Zondo "I’m from Tanzania I used to trust Thuli but now naaah!! @Willem I never think of 90%of ANC officials are corrupt @AubreyDe Bliquy are you a pastor?
Jenny B,@Yolo More - Hi not the same Bobat - that one was a Mohammad @PastorJJ - Hi did you see that Dudu's lawyer pick up the same as I did. "@Pastor J.J - so she was not a witness The AG does audit every year and all is ignored. Our Zonda is a hard working man.
Phakamile Khuzwayo,@dominic pryzbyliski ppl feel like they are sellouts if they have to remove the anc they rather suffer from their own then providing the best for their grandchildren @kopz koape but there are those who are better devils this race card doesn't feed us and we must wake up @kopz koape those still supporting are the ones who were on the queue for tenders

Daniel David International,it is clearly that there is nothing we can do here with African national corruption but to vote it out
thembisa odendaal,@SalSA no one is beyond reproach perhaps we should all start there because if we don not acknowledge the inherent flaws of being human we end up here @Coolcat ok now I'm really worried if you think Izzo kodwa is clean...the shortest list would be who's clean in their ANC you gonna struggle to get an A4 page

Allan Appiah,You can't be spokesman if you can't spin a story Seems like everyone is tainted
