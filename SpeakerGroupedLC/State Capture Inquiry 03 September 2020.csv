Sorry for the wake-up call "120 cold drinks 4 cases of wiskey Many more companies that did the same !! She is Mama Christmas for the community.

Douglas Masuku,"Notshe trying hard to up his game today. More organized A naughty schoolgirl will use lies like this to get out of trouble Naught schoolgirl LIES Ndeku moment. Bravo Adv. Notshe. You have spring in your step today!! high quality whiskey no gal Its really embarrassing Why were these not delivered directly to the Kagiso center.?
Lukhanyo Makahla,did she say i could see you dancing ibus chairman thulani i have heard her kakuhle. 😂😂😂😂😂 DCJ was on that party i tell you guys "@Ntsikelelo ababantu bayazana ""Babu Zondo"" lahla umlenze" @Ntsikelelo you can tell his very naughty and a charmer a dinner with many other people
Nicholas Gigaba,this old woman is.a professional liar her teach was from Nkandla "Zondo please please Mr chairman dont lead the accuse let them carry on speaking "We do understand sometimes pple organise something for u without yr knowledge and knowing who did what  "Mr Zondo once again stop interfering let the advocates grill this one
Ernest Mamabolo,Flew over the head that one Yerrrr Lol Zondo is tooooo accommodating. This party story is tired. She’s been caught out. She’s lying again and doesn’t want to be called back for right of reply later. SMH. @Portia lol
Juan van Heerden,rehearsed Zondo's deep baritone voice makes me feel like less of a man... "ha ha ha ha ""honestly speaking""" blah blah blah
Cola Madlela,Eat and not be interested in who organised
Craig Woodward,"Whoops! ""Nobody on the programme..."""

Mamatomo Makhajane,Nomkanyane just tell the truth because there's no smoke without fire. Can you really attend your birthday celebration without knowing who paid for the function?:dothefive:lying.. so annoying not remember who attended. lie....! "nomvula you knew you were going to testify nomvula man lona le diha ANC hle. ya neh.....
sello mokoka,Kanti wS this break your leg or kahlua umlenze party not video recorded so that proof attendance could be showned. Why is she always looking the other side or are is she been advised by her lawyers. Even her PA was always looking sideways.
Frank Jordaan,And she is going to shift everything onto her late husband. Why did she not say at her previous appearance that she did have a birthday party on her 40th. She denied ever attending a birthday party at that venue. Eisj. Too old to remember a party attended by 174 people. A bit om my memory reminds me that there was a party. Priceless!!!! Now she remembers the decor This lady's life is full of suprises The more she speaks the more the noose tightens. Did she take the oath to tell the truth before she started testifying. How must the guys at Bosasa feel about spending R80000 on her party and she does not even remember the event. She cannot remember whether Agrizzi or Watson was there but can recall exactly a what a guest told her. So convenient to shift the blame onto your dead husband. Exactly Theo. "The more she speaks "Surprise You keep it quite!!!? Excellent question Douglas. Telling the judge that his assumption is flawed. Eisj. What a strange marriage- her husband never told her anything. Another lie- the state did not install the CCTV cameras at her house. Semotse well said. Another lie. Patrick I have the utmost respect for Judge Zondo. So this time she suprised her husband by asking for a R3m car. So two people who were involved are dead. And now blaming Escom So why do you need an attorney to arrange finance on a car????
TLOU MASOGO,birthday girl la 40 years now they got her lol... lol she gives brandy zondo is sleeping
