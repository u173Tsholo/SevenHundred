Kholokazi Ngoma,Khanithule
Derek Main,@Raven Penny Absolutely - BEE is the cover for the corruption Seems like transformation is used as a handy excuse for corruption. BBBEE partners are tokens BBBEE is killing our economy - people who add no benefit taking millions out of companies. "@Elvis Malakoane In the ANC's selection processes @makhosi nobhatyi Zuma has been making a mockery of our justice system - it's about time they got tough on him. Enough is enough! "@Bev Daniels As usual ""Careful what you wish for @makhosi nobhatyi Yes - it's amazing that someone who's not guilty is fighting so hard to stay out of court. @Biza330 They must do the same for Zuma as they did for Mubarak - put a bed in court and let him attend his trial. "This lady must be an ANC - when her lips move Transformation is an excuse for corruption """I'm not a racist but..."""
Lorna Kavanagh,Surely the people who make the aircraft should be the 1st and only supplier of aircraft parts and Rolls Royce for engine components ??? This go between is when big problems start.. BBBEEE = trouble BBEEE. has been behind alot of fraud and corruption. The multi nationals were Boeing and Airbus !!! The makers of aircraft. Their parts and components were the guaranteed parts and therefore the safety of the flying public. ..... blah blah The facts are SAA IS BANKRUPT !!! SAA IS BANKRUPT MS MEMELA!!* SAA IS BANKRUPT MS MEMELA BBEEE HASNIT HELPED SAA MS MEMELA SAA is not a going concern it has been looted. Ms Memela is full of stories ...
