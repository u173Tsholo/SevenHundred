Aubrey De Bliquy,oh there you are when will they return? That gupta technician again. Did anyone at SABC even know there was a problem with the sound yesterday? It's the same fault. Eventually got through to SABC and after 2 attempts got through to the technicians and the sound ame back as I was waiting for a reply. They did not understand the tremendous advantage inherent in a closed source agreement based on sounf business because they saw Denel in adversarial terms. probably because it was a primarily white entity. "@Naledi Barron Yes @Naledi Barron I dount therewas a shadow of corruption over Denel. They would not have been the successful entity they were if they had such a culture. The culture of collective guilt based on race is atoxic and destructive thing inevitably bound to failure. "You can dictate management of a business from a central collective gnite @Naledi Barron

Dominic Przybylski,Pravin does not know how much the two SAA business rescue practitioners have been paid but does not deny that they've received well over R10 million per month. "Governments are just 'official' versions of mafia "@Naledi Barron and in many of our municipalities in South Africa re extortion of taxes @Naledi Barron We can automate most of business with machines which aren't susceptible to greed corruption and a thirst for power. I'm working on it... *government* not 'business' If government can be automated then we don't need politicians who contribute nothing except conflict. @Naledi Barron Automation of government into an efficient incorruptible service will allow people to be more productive and generate a better standard of life . There would be more work not less. There is only one thing which motivates all politicians - a thirst for power over other people. @Angelo Doubel Yup. That's why I don't want them in my life. The only person who should control me (as an adult) is me. The only person who should control you is you. The power mongers try to herd us into a 'collective' mindset. That's the only way they can get power over us. If we don't recognize and honor our own individuality we betray ourselves. @Angelo Doubel Is no accident that the minister of 'higher education' is the leader of SACP.
Mzalwane Mzala,Mr Kennedy is all about business @Angelo Doubel I believe the head of intelligence thing is overplayed if you consider that Terror Lekota was also a head of ANC intelligence. @Angelo Doubel The Guptas did not make but bought a president. Zuma was a mistake of Mbeki's team as they plucked him from the obscurity of KZN to stymie the campaign of Winnie Mandela in 1997. @Naledi Barron I was active in the processes that saw Zuma becoming a Deputy President of the ANC. We made a mistake @Nemabubuni Geoffrey At some point some thought Mmusi was to be an alternative and that ended in tears "@Freddie Van Rhyn A reality is that the second and third biggest parties hate each other. They could negotiate in 2016 but not anymore. No one party can take on the ANC Our constitution does not cater for government of national unity like the one we tried in 1994. No realistic option to form a coalition against the ANC can work without the DA ad the EFF. All other parties are too small. Fact @Naledi Barron It must start with getting the DA and the EFF in the room and around the table. That would be a coalition government. We tried a government of national unity in 1994 where the biggest 3 parties were represented. The NP walked out after about 18 months @Tommygun Without that arrangement there can be no coalition government against the ANC in South Africa in the 20 years or so. No one party will grow to the point of taking on the ANC on its own @Tommygun @Tommygun The opposition is proving incapable of capitalizing on ANC own goals @Tommygun That's our reality Angels with horns @Yolo More Are you serious? Eish Mr. Kennedy is the boss! Mr Kennedy likes order Those of you who have by-elections in your wards I hope you have voted. How does attorney- client confidentiality work in such commissions?
