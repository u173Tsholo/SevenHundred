In short a Zuma excuse Time for Adv Seleka to come in for the kill he explains everything as if he's in court @rohan barnard Zuma understood when she introduced herself as DuDu with Myeni more Alta @wim louw no chat on eNCA "@Alta trek Kaap toe 25 vehicles including a Bentley (R3m) Ferrari (R3m) and house in market for R85m was seized by AFU belonging to Sodi Blackhead Consulting also seized @Nadeli please refresh this 60yr old brain so many getting killed now for speaking out did not know Watson was in a Bentley Watson died in a Toyota Carolla Mpanbani was killed in his Bentley
Arthur Kona,Has the wise judge checked when ministers were sacked & new ones were appointed. That is significant as it shows a link between those who resisted & those who enabled
Yolo More,The man must appear before the Commission in flesh @Keith Fallick I dont know When did they start? Looks like they are moving already Lets go Advocate Seleke Our Slow Poison is not playing any games today.😐 @Mthokozisi Molefe😅 Protect me mr Chairman 😋 Seleka 🤣🤣🤣 Tsotsi this one.

"You are not done advocate Yhooo! This man doesnt want to come out of that toilet

Kevin Simon,This guy is the Silver Assassin! I'm sure he would have been a liberal magistrate in Rhodesia. 😇😇😇😀 This guy is cut from the same cloth as Bell Pottinger. Why did Dudu need a White Rhodesian magistrate to help her???????!!!!!
Keith Fallick,"why is he not there  Sanfran thanks
Francoise Phillips,He should be made to sit at the commission in person. The fact that he worked for Dudu Myeni says everything we need to know about this crook. Why did the Zuma crowd hire a Rhodesian magistrate when we have such fine legal minds that are experienced and qualified in South African law? "Nick Linnell Not even a Zimbabwean magistrate but a Rhodesian magistrate. "Coordinating state capture and the stashing of state funds into the Jacob Zuma Foundation Antony Fourie he is an ex Rhodesian magistrate who was Dudu Myeni's coordinator/adviser and he fired people at Eskom according to Zuma's requests through Myeni. He also set up the Jacob Zuma foundation which needs to be forensically audited urgently. Wish the Chair would just let Seleka run with his train of questioning and not interrupt and defend Linnell. @Mbuso Ndlovu it means 'seal island' a robyn is a seal in dutch. Agree @CYRIL NDABA He is very vague about all these supposed companies he has worked for and his actual experience.
Sandi Hobson,Silver Fox
Bumpy Johnson,Should force him to come in Zoom commission is nonsense. He must come and lie in person
Mondli Nohashe,How can he be involved in disciplinary matters of an entity where he is not employed Was there a formal appointment ? Yes or No This guy was reporting to Dudu & Zuma. The minister was nowhere He must now draft his warrant of arrest Zondo must attend to another witness now Zondo looks tired R84 Billion Mooikloof Mega-City Development. This is fresh food for ANC comrades @Yolo More. He smells curry No waste of time. This one is supposed to sleep behind bars today @Sal SA only Dudu can know @Rene Ngwenya. Awu! Notshe my home boy Crook from Rhodesia Zondo is ready for lunch & next witness Is Zondo drinking wine ? @Tommygun. is the implicated Zuma coming back ? @Tommygun. I hope Zuma will come back because he is at the centre of everything
Fred Desrosiers,This guy is trying to justify the large amounts he got paid. He did not do anything to stop state capture. that is why those entities have a board @Francoise. agreed "he was a hired ""gun"" to kill the careers of those who stood in the way of the looting" that was R170k per month 10 years ago support the board ? the board was not the one who hired him. "@Tommygun "@Tommygun "@Tommygun "@Mthokozisi The coordinator/consultant has no corporate responsibility and can come up with anything and will not have to suffer for it. Linell asks like he was the one running the management at Eskom
SanFran Arnold,@Keith Fallick it is because of age and covid with his underlying medical issues @Yolo More gm @Keith Fallick always a pleasure "@Andre Gerber gm @Kevin Simon almost exactly @Elisah Livhuwani gm @Vhutali Mashila it is not and this testimony is important for verification of placement of individuals in meetings and the outcomes @Xolani J Masemula gm Yes Adv. Seleka @Ashne Hesselberg it is due to his underlying medical issues @Ashne Hesselberg always a pleasure YES ADV. SELEKA "The meeting called for by the SAA chairperson to discuss Eskom business with the President "The President should discuss issues with his ministers @Anthony Fourie this is Mr. Nick Linnell @Anthony Fourie he was Dudu's lapdog. He was brought in to suspend the board of Eskom @wim louw @ALTA more mense @Sabelo Nxumalo gm "He was receiving free flights with Dudu as she was still chairperson of that board. He arranged through his lawyers to give evidence this way due to age Dudu has no money anymore and she is a delinquent director and she has lawyers fees to pay for her appeal @Xolile Titus I think it was Lynne Brown "@Will thats a laugh @SUPAwrens 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 "@Naledi Barron hello dear friend The problem here is that Linnell has covered himself here. He did not take money from the Gupta's directly and neither did he loot. He was asked as a legal consultant how to do the dirty work "He knows that he was enabling corruption but turned a blind eye "@Roza essack hi @Musiclover Not at all. She needs to come back to answer for her perjury as well as her huge role in helping the Gupta's take over the SOE's. She is the dvil incarnate. @wim louw 😅😅😅😅 @Yolo More you crack me up @Naledi Barron @ALTA - thunder and lightning very very frightening - Bohemian Rhapsody @Thobani Mkananda much appreciated @wim louw excellent "@ALTA no skat "We all heard the recordings State capture is capturing a country. Country capture would have to be an invading army taking a country captive. @Gerard Victor my thoughts exactly "So state capture starts off by capturing the media @Gerard Victor Im sure he will find someone on the inside to do that for him @Sabelo Nxumalo not only that they created their own news agency to propagate propaganda @Andre Geldenhuys no he was not. Watson was in a Toyota Corolla The suspensions were for those that were not willing to loot. The looting Gupta puppets were then inserted. AKA Anoj Singh @Bev Daniels we have started and is live @ALTA I know a guy @wim louw shhh we don't say his name out loud🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Jenny Whitewaves we have to more for today *2 "@Immanuel yes it is my friend @Yolo More no its not @Xolani J Masemula 🤣🤣🤣 There was no wrongdoing on any of the exec's part. They just needed Gupta stooges in "Zuma needed them out for the Gupta's @ALTA not most.....all.....what is being done today is to rebuild. They took it all leaving us on our knees "The first sign of dodgy dealings @Jenny Whitewaves exactly "DCJ cannot handle the fact that he not only being a lawyer @Xolani J Masemula Eskom was not always a failing SOE. We had the cheapest electricity for years and then it was overrun by looters @Jenny Whitewaves water affairs has everything to do with Nomvula Mokonyane and that has to be answered as well "@Tommygun exactly. the capacity is not numbers @Xolani J Masemula wise word choice post 94... "@Jenny Whitewaves yes he was her ""fixer"" in the KZN area water board. He has walked a long path with her" @Naledi Barron thanks hun @Tommygun that is the argument that DCJ is struggling with being the second highest judge in our land @rohan barnard she was blessed by her blesser @Sal SA hello @rohan barnard 😅😅😅 @Yolo More exactly he must tell them if he ate the curry "Thats it Adv. Seleka Linnell knows that he was brought in as a farce. The whole thing was done way before by the Gupta's Dudu brought in a non Gupta fixer so as to cover her trails. He is complicit in the wrongdoings but he is not an exact wrongdoer Eskom owes 500mil in debt far from being a cash cow. It has been depleted of cash by Zuma and the Gupta's. What we need now is international investment for the betterment of local South Africans "@Sal SA he should have asked the questions instead of just doing How can they do that if he did not have a contract to do any work at all? @Eddie Reddy sorry just saw I ut mil it is Bil "@R.m. B. yes @Pastor J.J yes San for saint and Fran for Francis. Named after my grandmother Francis and my mother modernised it. @R.m. B. it was cancelled due to the storm and technical issues Linnell was a front for the actual goings on behind the scene @Pastor J.J 😂😂😂😂 @Rip Torn Brown should be arrested @Sal SA exactly. Brown was told to force his ousting so it could not come back to her and her president @Pastor J.J 😳😆 @Jacqui Baumgardt hello @R.m. B. I agree. His testimony is the most helpful I have heard. Also he does not own any Bentley's He was being paid his consultancy fee and did what they asked. What he did not do was loot the state. A man that they could throw shade on especially because he is white @Naledi Barron say it aint so - Weezer "@Sthakathi Khumalo Zondo is amazing and he will have damning recommendations @Tommygun exactly "Capitalism is the payment for services rendered Very interesting as to how he showed things happened. It puts the president in a compromising position - interference
Elvis Malakoane,Paul O' Sullivan rocked his boat Mthokozisi Molefe Goodmorning to you I thought of you yesterday Mthokozisi Molefe I am thanks and you mthokozisi Molefe people must do the right thing after testimony I suspect the commission has a bomb on his qualifications mthokozisi Molefe let's have some patience I see some action is starting Andre Geldenhuys He must fall with his Gang
Nick Jooste,Interesting how he choses his answers very carefully @Paul Buchel excluding all of his extra claims He is brilliant Can I also get a job there. No appointment but a nice salary... wow "Simple Nothing is unclear here "Sunday meetings Modus Operandi = Help his pocket. You must still be appointed by the board to act on behalf of them in any consuling space @Fred Desrosiers well said "@GB correct Hahaha... I was there but it was cancelled. I worked but I was never appointed. THUG Falling apart @Will I guess so.
Elisah Livhuwani,mornings africans @tumi and @ arnold your are welcome mr seleka nail him mr zondo stop interrupting @fourie he was woerking for dudu muyeni and zuptas nice question adv seleka

Ketane Ropo,"I believe the question has been answered sufficiently. There are factions at SOEs. On the other hand outside lawyers are also brought in with ""loaded"" agendas."
Mthokozisi Molefe,that's why he should be arrested also hey Elvis how are you today Very well Elvis now what did you think of me? what's up with this Rhodesia magistrate Yeah Elvis but I think this commission is a circus Yeah let wait and see Tappies you can't live without Zuma Ashne they're trying so much to run away Yolo They're trying so hard to run away 😅😅 They're attending Sundays meetings these people don't even go to church 😂😂 I'm suspecting another Watson saga after this Ashne😂😂 all the truths are coming out People I'm seeing a Watson Saga happening again soon they must protect this guy STRU Elvis but I fear for this guy Khuzwayo yeah I heard man but I suspect this guy will also disappear This guy is going to jail no doubt I don't even think he's here in SA this one lol dudu has no money DCJ DCJ Andre you wish
Garden Beehives,Morning All...usually watch after hours but today live Linnell is rather arrogant trying to justify his unnecessary fees
Nkosiyazi Mtsheleni,me i don't under the matter i great you all i joined even thought i miss
Samuel Skosana,Greetings all. Just joined now. Did I miss much? The Chair is out of order. Adv. Seleke should be allowed to pursue his line of questioning He is from Rhodesia and ran away to SA "DCJ dont think Mr Saleke is now gatvol for all the interruptions from DCJ Greed Thompson "Sorry He should get out of his bathroom and return to Zim "The Ides have come Power to you advocate. You now have him by the short and curlies! "Keep up the pressure advocate Go for the jugular now adv Seleka Tighten up the noose around his neck now Adv.Seleka

thando cezula,Nonsense! There's no need for a coordinator! You were coordinating Dudu Myeni's neferious means
Wayne Moodley,"imagine paying 20% more for a job for a ""Co-ordinator"""
Bekamuzi Xintshembhiso,yeah neh
Tommygun,Linnelll didnt hire himself and just took what was given with open arms.... Heres the rub 🙂 Did Mr Linnell knowingly deal with crookedness @Jenny Whitewaves agree when and how did Linnell discuss his fees for his work and attendance at meetings? Im sure he got his pay in writing from someone? "Linnell has alo tols d us that all the SOEs have their own legal and hr teams but dont seem to do the job "So far I dont get the feeling Linnell wants to hide anything @Fred Desrosiers He was kinda fed a fabricated story tho and acted on that and the wishes of board members? "@Andre Geldenhuys Im with you @Linda James rather glaring discrepancy They were suspended with no charges or allegations exactly to impune a implicate them... @SanFran Arnold Its the old case of SOEsand Municipalities not having the capability/work ethic of running things and calling in consultants to do their job. How do you talk about problems with suspended executives? Argument might be that no sane person specially with legal background would have suspended the board members "@Xolani J Masemula True I think Dudu was the fixer and Linnell was the legal rubber stamper. @Xolani J Masemula Yup! It was the wrong view based on the evidence at the time Hindsight? anyone? @Linda James Why do all these Socialists own and covet so much... @cassim suleman Bingo! "So was it Linnells idea to suspend or was it someone elses? If it was his it was a crap idea "Clearly his opinion Are there any other precidents of suspending employees on full pay with no charges or allegations so that investigations can go forward? He whitwashed it "@Lucky Benya Not so bad @Mondli Nohashe I believe hes been politely asked to come back 🙂 He just set up the suspensions and rubber stamped it. Once the board had their suspensions and media release they could carry on Without Linnell "@Mondli Nohashe We all due "@SanFran Arnold Not a bad model but needs a fair bit of tweaking @SanFran Arnold Better than the faux Socialism tho! So often the most interesting testimony comes right at the close...
Sonwabo Thobani,I bet you Zuma will want this interview
Douglas Masuku,I'm under loadsheding but there is no Eskom notice to this effect.
Franscina Mosikili,Franzo
Tappies Smit,"I hope Adv Seleke took this zuma looter to the cleaners..people THIS LOOTING HAPPENED WHEN ZUMA WAS ELECTED..A PERSON WITH 99.9% NO EDUCATION..THANK YOU ANC😡 "This ghoon is ducking and diving...he This moegoe is hiding somewhere so that it will be difficult to arrest him..that explained the empty room. This moegoe is trying to justify his actions to clear his name from wrong doing...he is a looter like zuma and his cronies. Lynn Brown is a bigger fish in the Eskom looting as what people can imagine...she needs a orange suit

Ntsikelelo Vani,the chair is protecting this crook why is the Chair focusing on the meeting in Zuma's house or the Durban meeting
Siphenkosi Mlandezo,Testing
Andre G,@Antoinette Meyer I hope he is in trouble. He is an arrogant person who demands authority... pointing fingers. He walks with Dudu since 2009 and that says a lot. If Dudu asks me to attend a meeting and compile a document and I did nothing wrong - just accept a task for R 167 000 I shall do it.... I do not say Lennell is clear though. "I do not like this guy Robben Island - Rob is a seal in Afrikaans and Robben is name for seals in Dutch. That is why the Union Buildings in Pretoria will be renamed the Robben Island Old Boys Country Club. The first political prisoner on Robben Island was Harry the Strandloper during the 1600's Real name is Autshumao but no streets or airports named after him. @SanFran Arnold Exactly - and Zwane concluded the deal in Switzerland.... @Andre Gerber Watson was spotted in Seychelles on 3 occasions Things were wrong in areas as you wanted to make space for a GUPTA Board at Eskom - you and Dudu... This Linnell is thick skinned as a Rhino - He costed the country millions in packages paid to the suspended guys..... "@SanFran Arnold Not capitalisms fault - it is dishonesty South Africa must be the MOST corrupt country in the world - nail this guy - he thinks he was the boss of Eskom - Imagine you work for him and he is a bully and demands all the time...
GB,Morning Peeps lol @togu madikane incredible - did he ever question the legitimacy of his iinvolvement? @ Tommygun ' fed a fabricated story' my foot. His bedfellows Dudu Myeni etc ?
Bongumusa Musasa,someone farted
Jenny Whitewaves,@Tommygun I don't think it was a concern to him what was happening He got his instructions did as told and pocketed the fee As a lawyer I don't think he asked to many questions = no knowledge @Ntsikelelo Mgxigxwà Proves Dudu ;lied on statement proves JZ was in on setting up corrupt people in power at Escom toadvantafe of Guptas advantafe sorry Is this the only witness today or is someone booked for this pm Thanks they are going to have to move a bit faster to get them in They had to go because I was told they had to go. I never asked why because then I could say this rubbish under oath without lying @Anne M. may have been on my mind It's lawyer training you don't ask the defendant you are defending if they are telling the truth so that they can't say you didn't do your best for them @SanFran Arnold need to go further back than that there is something about the water dept in I think EC @SanFran Arnold this guy first became an adviser to Dudu in some stuff about water before SAA We need to know what he had to fix for her then How important was it that Escom failed to push the nuclear option because of Russian bribes and the Guptas uranium holdings
Anne M.,@Andre Geldenhuys Couldn't agree more "@Theo van Zijl He was a ""consultant"" to Dudu. I don't think she would follow proper procedures I think Linnell has more than met his match in Adv Seleke @Will Sounds like from his bathroom @Yolo More 😆 Or he's self-isolating because he's been in contact with a Covid person? @Rip Torn Hi Antoinette @Mbuso Ndlovu Robben is the Dutch word for seals. It had/s a big seal colony. "@Xolani J Masemula @gugulethu dube Yes "Oh Hi @ALTA . "@SanFran Arnold Yes @Jenny Whitewaves And get paid that R160k per month consultancy fee. 🤨 @Naledi Barron Hello. Nice to see you back on the chat. Yes @Yolo More . Pretending that he did nothing wrong. Yup @Syug Do you mean Dudu Myeni?

Hello @Pastor J.J It's been a while since you've been here. @Rene Ngwenya You and me both. @Tebogo Sibilanga DCJ is aware of the number of staff on duty at the commission and everyone needs to have regular breaks.

Linda James,"@Luke Fisher .Myeni denies that Zuma was present at the meeting but both Tstotsi and Linnell put him at the meeting together with her son Exactly @Tommygun .....Two WHOLE PEOPLE!!!! Mr Linnell's testimony is key. He was working for Dudu Myeni but repudiates her version of events and supports Mr Tsoti's version. Why were the chief proponents of RET using a White man as their fixer????? My theory is that RET is a FARCE.....It is used to escape culpability for their covetousness @Tommygun

No These parasites hide behind Apartheid racism while they suck the life out of the country hurting the poor the most. @Thobani Mkananda Dagga prohibition is the last remaining Apartheid law. WHO cannot find their original document justifying prohibition because it exposes the hand of the Apartheid regime. "You should have one look at the rogues gallery of Amicus Causae behind the governments defence of Dagga prohibition. Big Pharma @Thobani Mkananda It is unregulated predatory capitalism of fiat money. Apartheid was never the main instrument of control. It just co-opted whites into an evil system that still hurts us all today. The business doctrine is amoral unaccountable profit that gives us Imasi at Pick'n Pay local stores feeding the poorest squatter camps at twice the price I get it from my local Giant Hyper. Unregulated Free Market Capitalism is undoubtedly an evil predator that created inequality by design. @Thobani Mkananda That would be my pleasure and privilege.
