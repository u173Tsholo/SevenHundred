"does anyone know what ""inter alia"" means" thanks @ssgs ssgs "why don't the lawyers just say ""among others""?" @Uncle Wally it doesn't matter if Moyane is bitter. Gordhan must be cross examined allegations must be tested if the law is to be objective @Uncle Wally it doesn't matter if Moyane is bitter. Gordhan must be cross examined "@Magda Seguin who is the thief @Singi Mathebula don't worry Zondo is a competent professional @Slindile Ngcobo maybe EFF using ANC who knows @Tobo Lwandile don't confuse yourself. we're dealing with the law now. testing allegations. halagasha @Thapelo Motabogi ! hold your horses @Allan Tshuma .

Ok i missed his evidence. i meant his 3-day testimony
ssgs ssgs,means 'among others' latin has precise meaning ...hence they use it lawa....
Vanessa Govender,Together with Now I'm convinced that this is just an EFF sponsored application to cross examine PG...there is just no grounds and this does not make any sense Dali Mpofu is always very personal when it comes to PG....just present the facts please. The Zuma stooges are going down one by one....Buffalo and PG are dealing with them piece by piece....
Michael Michael,No idea Moyane is just loosing everything.as much as he make the country 50b.fool Wally correct I dont even understand wt is he saying.he dont finish the setence.

Wally,Mpofu likes playing both sides of the coin Moyane is still bitter for being fired from SARS . So he is trying to get back at him @Joel Mzayidume I agree . I was just giving context to Moyane's hate for Gordhan Mpofu is flip flopping as usual He is of course the chair of the Extreme Flip Floppers he keeps losing Moyane has to put across his version first BEFORE cross examining Gordhan . Mpofu being schooled here . EFF = Extreme Flip Floppers . EFF followers are the biggest sheep . They believe EVERYTHING their leaders say . YouTube legal experts are the funniest Dali = Extreme Flip Flopper . Extreme Flip Floppers EFF = Extreme Flip Floppers "LOL Moyane should first provide his version  These YouTube legal experts are all MAMPARAS drunk on MAMPOER ! Moyane is a fool I wonder if Mpofu is doing this work PRO BONO just to try and score political points . LOL Moyane is a liar That much has been proven Shame all these bitter poor people in the comments defending Tommy Boy Moyane just because he is black . Moyane will be out of work for the next 5 years maybe longer depending on whether DD Mabuzas faction wins the next ANC conference . Nobody will employ this man . "@Bubele Vakalisa Shame  "Moyane must give his version  These YOUTUBE legal experts are so funny Guess what though ? Whether Moyane testifies or not ...the bulk of this chat will REMAIN poor Dali playing the race card which means HE HAS NO LEG TO STAND ON You can @Magda Seguin . You just remain poor regardless of whose side you take LOL Mpofu is lying ... @Magda Seguin LOL I don't care much for your feelings "@Magda Seguin Ah yes  Race card again LOL Race is weaponized when you have no other leg to stand on . Moyane is a boy LOL Tommy Boy Moyane "HAHAHA Mpofu very emotional  @Tholithemba Ntsele That is so true . Their anger towards whites / Indians / coloureds make them support corrupt individuals .

We are telling our stories now. We want Pravin back "Mentoor crumbled Pravin is going to jail Someone buy Pravin a big bucket of Vaseline Most Indians do not give invoices at their shop- Pravin people. Prain threw mud without evidence. Let it be tested Lets question Pravin. Nugent is not here We just wanna hear Pravin answer. Why is he so scared "A CNN journalist once asked Pravin if he has any evidence against Zuma Legal or no legal. Just wanna hear hear Pravin
Zee Zappier,when is this clown going to win a case?
Cassius Mngomezulu,Ahw shame he won one ya Supra The thing is we are going to accuse people without any evidence Moyane is guilty -you can see the way he's fighting Chief Justice vs SC EFF are promoting corruption "Why the EFF Guy is protecting the corrupt Moyane What is the EFF standing for-No corruption and other things Never @mbuso sibisi​ANC IS RACIST MORE THAN EFF -tjoooo omaka ngwana batho
Mollo Booi,let Pravin be cross examined..
Magda Seguin,Why don't Monyane take testify himself? Eish.Mpofu is silencing the Chairman True @Uncle this is a storm in a teacup of the EFF...They like to spread discord Mpofu is over zealous...a mistake What did Gordhan do but go against the EFF and Zuma?That is the crux of the matter.They are being exposed as thieves and they don't like it The EFF says Gordhan is the devil and their followers regurgitate the hate Mpofu is too over emotional....very revealing @Uncle the EFF is a quasi military outfit perpetuating hate and violence...They are a disgrace in parliament Adv.Mpofu....no decorum at all...interupting and talking over the Chairman I think the illegal cigarette mafia is happy with Mpofu today Adv Pretorious looks very embarrassed for Mpofu I am surprised that a professional expose himself like this for someone who has been publicly exposed as a captured crook Semantics Moody does not acknowledge what the Judge is saying...listening but not hearing *Mpofu @Vanessa...it's very obvious The EFF tried to implicate Gordhan with false information in Canada O can see that the EFF 'fighters' are out in force on this thread There you go...They always I insult...son of Ghandi? How terrible if one can only insult and not have intelligent discourse Thank you Judge Zondo Tom Monyane has NO integrity..he served the Guptas The so called Rogue Unit has been proven as hogwash So why is Zuma not charged with treason? this is really complete idiocy Zuma made SA a failed state Not animated...very emotional...I wonder why? Now he is disrespecting Judge Nugent Time is up Waffling He lost the last Monyane appeal Typical Monyane Let Monyane come to testify first Monyane is clutching at straws..afraid to go to jail...all the SARS evidence is in the public domain.I blame the Sunday Times disgraceful journalists They propagated take news which the EFF believe Fake news Monyane must come to testify....The commission must subpoena him Monyane failed numerous times in court Why do people condone state capture?Monyane worked for the Guptas I ignore and block those that insult me...The only morons I see are EFF stooges Monyane must tell us why his friends didn't pay millions in taxes So many professional and dedicated people were sacked by Monyane at SARS We dhould ALL be cincerned about money...taxpayers money.The country is nearly bankrupt "When Gordhan headed up SARS there were maximum tax collection "Monyane should go home and retire in peace...he is wasting public money and time of the Commission @Fatherland and that smuggler owes millions of taxes "@Thabiso...not to worry I will never understand how one can condone thievery Racism is rife in SA especially from the EFF and BLF...divide and rule tactics...us and them @Uncle with respect...some of us are very woke and educated So @Uncle...is it not a democratic right as citizens to have a discourse on the fate of our futures? I have no interest in taking sides...that is why I am objective...you are insulting my intelligence...be respectful Proves how SA men act behind fake identities online Own your crass statements...it doesn't make ANY difference in my life Eish!tea girl? Malema puppet stuff
Thomas Mtontsi,this has nothing to do with the EFF now... Deputy Chief Justice vs SC Again this has nothing to do with the EFF
jeevan singh,Musa. why do you say Gordhaan is a devil. Musa I think you must shut up. you know nothing about politics. in 1912 Gordon caught Malemas fingers in the Limpopo prov. that's how he got expelled from the ANC. again Gordon caught him for tax evasion. now Malema attracts the whole Indian race. Alan. I'm a grandson of BLACK ZULU. So you go back to Central Africa where you came from. Alan. Racist Alan. I am a Non racist EFF supporter. As for you. we don't want racisist people like you in our party. go join the DA. we don't want your support. Alan. you got my message. please you are a racisist. go join the DA. we don't want racicist people to join the EFF. OK. Jack. me Mbuso. Me Jack. Truth non violence and passive resistance is what I search for in any partly. I may disagree with many things of the party but the underlying TRUTH is what I base my support on coming as an opp "Jack this Alan guy is a racict EFF. I'm not and never was. and never will be. I cannot. Black grandfather British White Grandmother

Prince K. Dube,This application will fail simply. because Moyane has not provided a version of the things he disputes.
Zamile Sokoyi,The chair enjoys listening to himself
joentsako,simple Prince K..wats his version this guy mara
Singi Mathebula,can Dali listen please . is he trying to bully the chair. disgusting. moyana is history now. can someone advice him to go back to Mozambique. dali's behavior before Zondo is typical of EFf' s bulling tactics. the poor are now paying the price of 15% because of this idiot moyani. his brains are as short as he is. he must testify first. stupid. i hate you moyana malema's hatred for Gordan dates back to one point in polokwane #magda seguin👍 mpofu u ta huma moya ku nga ri khale. he is an opportunist. @vakali the race card has proof useless so far because . it limits you to look forward. EFF is the worst racist ever. so dali started his bedroom tactics with elderly woman. no wonder a delela. @joseph makofane i agree with you. this is the reason why he failed to give the chair a chance speak but dali is overboard hey learn to listen dali. a ku na mubvana kwalaho making noise does not suggests one is on the offensive.

michael mbatha,Dali pretending to represent Moyane while it's a clear EFF project. EFF vendetta against Pravin trying to waste time and taxpayers' money. Bunch of palookas.

"You cannot compare Mpofu and Ngcukayithobi with Maleka. At least Ngcukayithobi is still young he can match him in future Maleka represented Malema(CIC) not Eff. "Mike Lock Konje who is this guy? This is boring. Let me go back to GUPTA project😂😂. Ndakuva ngani. I cant dzeal with chartered accountants. It is too much for my understanding. Nindibize xa kuthethwa ngamasela.

Philani Madlala,She is out order 😂😂😂 Pravin brought a white lawyer because he believes white is better than black Pravin is part of the dot we are connecting right now🤔 Mike how am I racist Pravin is dizzy together with his white lawyers "Sorry lady lawyer we don’t deal with perceptions here Askis bagayetso. I retract my comment 😂😂😂
Elev8 Africa Networks,@Guys both Black and White lawyers are paid by us tax payers. @Spha Nkosi Moyane was a political deployee "AGAIN
Myka'Al Daud,Pravin will be cross examined... IF he wasn't there he ll just say i wasn't there simple "Pravin is wasting our time He must just tell the truth it doesn't matter how many he said it. "How does she know that "Law is not about opinions or hate for someone Chair will have a chance to hear the questions n judge Justice for everyone why not allow other side to challenge the allegations Francel bcos of racism we r landless Whats wrong with EFF to fight for Afrikan dispossessed masses Afriforum is protecting white privilege n EFF fight for those who were robbed. "Mpofu is an Advocate "How do u become SC if u just blow hot air Lies of Skelembosch must be exposed Black ppl concerned with who is best talker of foreign language is so self hating "It took 40 yrs to promise land "Those fighting 4 us to get the land must be patient All this will pass away Skellembosch must fall "Eslon u accept ppl must come there n discredit other politicians bcos of factional battle I m happy that chair will consider facts n not innuedos spread by media
Rendani Mulaudzi,jah
Fatherland Loyalty and Socialism above all,@mbuso sibisi Stop accusing the ANC of racism and deal with your EFF. The ANC led the process of putting together the Freedom Charter that was launched in 1955. That Charter says South Africa belongs to all who live in it black and white. The EFF's defence of Moyane is unprincipled The EFF has got to a point of fighting the battle of Zuma and acolytes. Than you @Boitumelo Yali You are right @Magda Seguin . He also helped the EFF's cigarette smuggling benefactor. The EFF's working with the Zuma faction proves that they are not principled @Myka'Al Daud Your unprincipled stance led you to become friends of Zuma while you are criticising others for their past support of Zuma. The EFF and BLF are the black version of Afriforum. As a black person I am not a victim of the EFF so I am not about to argue whether they are racist or not. 'Racist attack' So the EFF's allegation of racism against Gordan emanates from Moyane. "In all fairness I would think that anything that was said in the commission can be cross examined. The chair can limit cross examination to only what was said here. @Phumlani Ranyana I ANC yeyethu. @Joel Mzayidume must go and consider who to register as the face of Poqo in the elections. The deadline is today at 5PM. ANC for the people. "Since the IEC deadline is at 5 today @Johnny Cash I like the way you push your EFF. @Tholithemba Ntsele must learn from you 😀😀
Thulani Nxumalo,What is Moyane's version? "Where is his version tested "As far as I recall and stand to be corrected
Thabiso Lehloo,Why should people be making such an effort to avoid cross examination. If you are telling the truth you should welcome any cross examination so as to get an opportunity to tell that truth again. This woman is weak @YinYan it is this type of argument that weakens the course for the advancement of women. This very post speaks volume of your mental capacity "@Yin Yang I have no intentions of engaging in senseless and pointless argument. My point remains
Bubele Vakalisa,The Le Roux character is waffling Moyane is corrupt. Gordhan is as corrupt if not worse "Nto ka Cwazibe """Expenditure on public resources"" "In other words "Nto ka @Mathebula "Tell us the ""lie"" @Uncle Tom Wally" "@mbuso sibisi ""stuttiring "" is how you write" "Best characterisation of Gordhan attitude towards the commission by Mpofu "Mpofu is not the best talker. I'd go on to say he is one of the worst. Hence it becomes important to listen to what he says
Shumani Sydney,moyane is corrupt finish and klaar
Francel van Eeden,@bubele it is so obvious that if you here something that discredit your opinion you go on caracter assasination a please the poor majority conly complains about racisim the easy way out so sick of the majority always hiding behind race
McReed,what's this about. I just landed on it online
Dennis Tsotetsi,Moyane and Mpofu trying their luck again. This will be their final nail to the coffin

Clearly we saw how one of the lead singers of this commission Vytjie Mantoor sang a different tune under re-examination. Akabuzwe! Interesting bromance between Zondo & Maleka @Ntombethemba Manase Its going downhill @Frik Brits Is that @Santo Ka Khazana - Swami Sharnanandji Hindi? My laptop at times does that and I tend to take in for repairs. Now I know who to ask to tell me what the message is. @Frik Brits So what to do when my lap top flashes such messages (aka a Whiter shade of pale) - knowing the words but cannot make meaning of them - dash for the door or celebrate return of the land? @Frik Brits Linux? Ok! @Eslon Eslon When Maleka wanted to cross Manyi; suddenly Manyi was like a boxer holding onto an opponent for dear life. I found it humorous. I think Pravin feared the same from Mpofu. @Frik Brits You not selling me something neh? "@Jack Sparrow It may well be a matter of principle. To a lay person like me
Ntando,😂😂awubuze impela mangethe
Mooks689,Malema told us that Pravin is going to fight with everything😀😀

Big vinny,"unfortunately mr Mpofu the easiest thing is let your client take the stand you can't test a version without putting your own version to be tested as well
