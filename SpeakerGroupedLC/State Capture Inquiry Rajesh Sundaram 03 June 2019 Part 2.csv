Tharaxis,"I love how a broadcasting company such as the SABC with millions of rands and technology Seems they've never heard of Stereo sound "I also love the soft picture very should probably just hide chat yeah but they just come in with new names "I was about to say well he did work for ANN7 100% "people can say ""this is not what I said"" and put his entire testiony in jepoardy" "@Zinhle Omontle because it's a legal issue "and the Judge is right very likely
Magda Seguin,"SABC was captured by Hlhaudi...another Zuma appointee Sabotage...SABC please act on the hackers SABC Digital please control the invasion of these bots Someone mentioned yesterday that the IEC was captured too Zuma infiltrated and corrupted each and every institution he could in SA @hilton module I remember very well when Zuma said that Someone cast aspersions on the new CEO of the IEC...and it may be correct This testimony about the OEC is a bombshell...watch the fallout soon The elections were a farce...what about the boxes found and the bad ink etc...nothing was investigated Oh so you are not complaining that the country was stolen? Not complaining is complicity Future generations will be amazed of how some people flocked to the ANC in spite of state capture Being part of the solution and putting pressure on the NPA to do its job is crucial Focus on your party?What party?South Africa belongs to ALL who live it... "Most of the implicated are still in the ANC "@makhosi nobhatayi that is exactly what Shamila Batohi said in her presser "@Solly 12 Exactly...they act on what they are told.Ace uses the line of party allegiance "I do "The person who edited his book should have assisted I am systematically reporting this harassment bots Thanks YouTube for removing the bots and also exposing who it is This man was only at ANN7 for FOUR months off course he will remember everything Zumas defence is getting thin...you can see how his previous lawyers disappeared...he will have no place to hide only maybe Dubai @Tee Makara you are correct "@michael mbatha I remember Judges are human beings and also has biases it seems In a sense I agree with the Judge but he could have been a bit nicer and not so rough on the guy.He was very lenient to other witnesses like Manuel Zumas lawyers was not up to the task in his last appearance..SC Trengrove was far above their argument @jett888 true look what they are doing to Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning CJ Moegoeng has stated after consultation that English only must be used in courts...the judge in the Zuma case overruled his Zulu request It will go to court...Batohi and Cronje was in fire in their press conference "In SA the judiciary is independant "Yes we trust him What crimes?who must go to jail @Solly 12 You can follow it on Twitter too I assume he meant 'him' who is our ex president Oh very!! really? for a joke? I agree wholeheartedly @Solly 12 We have a very strong constitutional democracy..but the criminals still have ways especially when they have absolute power like our ex president Google Daily Maverick ...its an investigative website...also Amaghunbane You will get all the information on what is happening "Especially FOX news The book has already been published Converted how? "I am nearly finished reading a French book about Russia and the oligarchs...the US was infiltrated by the Russians a very long time ago Putin is the ringmaster..they di the same in the UK Gigaba has A LOT to account for..he is still on the ANC NEC South Africans should thank this man for his testimony..taking on the Guptas and Zuma is the same as Agrizzi taking on Watson "Barr was so dishonest about the Mueller report Ok guys...I. off.Too much bots now.I suspect sabotage Thanks @Shaun Lukhele If the witness had to write what he felt in his resignation letter he would not have been alive today "The judge is nitpicking Leave it there please judge The judge never questioned other witnesses from SOEs who resigned...YOH what is this? Zuma style intimidation.KZN political killings are rife If he had mentioned his grievances in his resignation letter he wouldn't be here today Manyi must be subpoenaed to testify The Guptas used South Africans to terrorise this man Zuma is a total disgrace! I wonder why? True @KEITH "I am fully aware about Trump The Guptas flouted BCEA all the time

Zuma will say I want testify in Zulu But this is not a court "Jett888 true Magda Seguin everyone who participated in this grand corruption called state capture How is it possible that there are people who haven‚Äôt been following the proceedings of the commission Jett888 I suspect it‚Äôs ANC supporters turning a blind eye hoping this thing will die down Been blocking this rubbish maan it keeps on coming "Zondo shouldn‚Äôt be telling us about his doubts now

Big vinny,even though we don't like what the judge is saying but is right
911Engineering,We got the point let's move on Thank you let's move He is an authentic Judge
Nkululeko Ngwenya,Zondo is lecturing the journalist's work unprofessional journalist he is mumbling a lot no facts written down tjooo he is a judge and he needs facts he should have brought basic principles of journalism and give it to Zondo simple

What a nonsense letter.....full of lies....respect for the Guptas.....wow @jett888 Hmmm....maybe. He should have been scared after what happened to the guy that filmed a Gupta in Dubai?? Judge Zondo treated a know Criminal like Agrizzi better than this guy....Why? "@Mwamuzi Shadrick I do I agree Thando Chair has strange behaviour today? Zondo is obsessed with the book?
nqubeko ngema,5 minutes break for the judge
Tshepo Chiloane,watching from Brooklyn in Pta
Antonie Engelbrecht,dont trust this judge
michael mbatha,Zondo's attitude towards this guy is similar to that of Adv Pretorius as Agrizzi was concluding his testimony. Behaving like a defence attorney of thieves. If I was this guy I would be discouraged. "Zondo is being petty. The contents of the book belong to the writer
Channel blocker,he is throwing the book out of the evidence submission every persons biography is questionable
Yvonne Morudu,went to get cup of tea what happened is this tea break?
Aviwe Nondabula,i wonder üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Mashudu Tshikororo,they are just clearing the smoke which is a right approach Rajesh Sundaram His a bit emotional Zondo is using a proper approach of Law "as a Lawyer I would do the same in case he is cross examined hence he understand better as a journalist "Makhosini Nkosi Ndaa
watson mutanga,Whether Zondo is biased or not on asking the credibility of the quotes is immaterial. Remember Zuma & company will defend themselves. Their lawyers will definitely ask that question.
Derek Main,"Zuma will say ""I want to testify with forked tongue""." Zuma wanted to be abused - he had a trial run with Shaik.
Caitlin C,I just saw this on YouTube. what's going on? can anyone explain wow this is the first time I'm hearing of this. why is this not on the national news it seems very important if anyone understand please explain I'm confused. this sounds serious but what happened ??? I have no idea this was even happening. it hasn't been in the news at all thank you no I'm English @jett888 thank you I'm glad it's not just my country who's not reporting it.

Felix Muyoba,"dcj he is an indian but the guy is right..why does the dcj and the advocate want to grill him on this? zondo is out of touch today when one leave his former place of employment he doesnt have to be angry or throw insult words or is that what dcj and the advocate want from him? @Thando Nkutha true and they were indian family.. they were strong arming this guy these guptas backed you up when you are dead? no man!! and the fact that he wrote a resignation letter in a friendly way to play them mind games..i think this guy was right and i dont know why dcj and the advocate are making a meal out of this.. "@Albert Noah he is missing the point imagine it was a terrible working environment been watched all the time while doing your job hang on hang on

Shaun Lukhele,I read Sundaram's book when it was published last year. All the things he is mentioning at the commission today is no shocker. It's literally a repeat of what is in the book.
Moses Magabane,What is the problem with Zondo today?
Khaya Nomoyi,Can he just say yes he was misrepresenting his true feelings and move on.He is not on trial here.He could not have written the letter any other way. He knew the whole arrangement was destroying his intergrity as a journalist. @jet888 I do not think so bcos he hax survived up to this stage of giving evidence. Why is the dcj not intervening and ask for clarity on the threaths he suffered as usual but choose to keep quiet? It seems like he is not interested about the abuse people suffered under the Guptas.
