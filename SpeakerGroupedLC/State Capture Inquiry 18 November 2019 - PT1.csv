Will respond at the right time bro> @Charel Gmail ...Absolutely agree with you. But...I chose to ignore some of the nonsense. @Stronger together ....Please take your nonsense elsewhere and dont impose it or yourself on decent and intelligent people. If you cant then just whisper to yourself. Pleeeeeeeez "@Mbulelo Maquba ...And who taught Zuma that the ""shower"" prevents HIV and AIDS?" @Easy D ....I use most of the silly comments to brighten my day.

Anything new to make you even more foolish?
Epnet Streaming,Sound buzz Interfered in Rhodesia too South African exchange controls must have approved this transaction? Ask them for the details why this money was allowed to leave Standard Bank account? Speak to Treasury. What about foreign exchange controls? What was the banner under which the transactions were approved?

Tapelo get help for your colour priblrm problem "Tapelo "No "Tapelo "Sorry Thapelo Thapelo must be blocked. racism it acceptable. "Racism unacceptable. sorry "Thapelo "Easy D Tom Moyane "Stronger together Deep state independent reporter uncovering global crookery in intelligence. "I recommend George Webb for the bigger fraud picture and capture of oil pipelines Bingo Pastor üôèüòÇ "Thapelo Meddling? He's helping us to track our money and bring it back! "Sthakani "redriger "redriger that are getting kickbacks from shell companies dtc "sorry Peter was invited to speak on asset recovery. Nigeria had to get help to recover oil money. We also need help. Don't know if NPA can cope with the Gupta tip of the iceberg.
Anthony Ramasike,this is highly classified info actually he regards this commision quite very high learned pple will bore you if u a educated @eleanor indeed
Elneamo,Canary is singing loudly now... fascinating ! En jou punt is ????
Willem Drotsky,"It's worth your time to listen to this man Bitcoin is the future of money exchange and will negate the controle that Bank have. Amen. "The biggest payen in the ars of the old National Government. Cricket Rugby etc If you own bitcoin you have the power of a Bank and nobody controle Bitcoin.
Robert Russell,I bet the Guptas are watching this for sure @Siyabonga Mchunu..... he accumulated his wealth in the UK.... you sound like a EFF voter "\Yip he has.... all the way back to the 1960""s @elaine norris" @Stronger together .....so are you on the square? @Eliot Chauke ...AN Crooks
Siyabonga Mchunu,"I find it curious that he seems to have intimate knowledge of their methods. But ke @makhosi nobhatyi I will give him the benefit of the doubt for now. Although I would like to know how he accumulated his wealth at some point. @Robert Russell Stop being childish. I am merely pointing out that somebody with such an intimate knowledge of how these dodgy financial systems work arouses some level of suspicion himself. Trust and charitable foundations are often the most effective funnels for illicit financial flows. Lord Peter Hain is involved in many of those. I am just curious as to why he is here... "The moment he mentioned HSBC and Standard Chartered "I have missed out on the past 30 minutes. Any big corporate names dropped yet? Beyond Standard Chartered "So Name those people man...arghhh
makhosi nobhatyi,We are nearly to close down the options of Zuma and Guptas now we will get them @ Mchunu this man take time to investigate them with assistance from whistleblower "@ Eliot Chauke he done investigation with international bank how money flow "@ Eliot Chauke thanks bro I am not surprised why they hate Gordhan so much because he caught them Tjoo guys I am the one who stands for Gordhan in support of his work to clean up the state but Zuma allies has sweet mouths to blind people that they were fighting for us which is not true "@Mbulelo Maquba please don‚Äôt just jump inside the pool without seeing how safe you are "@ Mbulelo Maquba I am well informed brother "We must agree all ubaba Zuma wenze kabi ukusebenzisana nalaba bantu "@Sthakathi Khumalo with all respect but you are not making any sense now "@ Sthakathi Khumalo remember Hawks you are taking about was captured
Vuyiswa Mkhwanazi,The intricacies and complexities of this or in the grand scheme of things are so fascinating. Stunning cooperation and cohesion from multiple parties
Eliot Chauke,who's this man @Bianca ok... He's gt a British accent... whats his role in State Capture... ok Why do we have a Brit testifying? what was his role in State Capture? i think he's here to fulfill 'the plan' that uBaba was talking about Why are you guys attacking Thapelo dont block him... engage him... tolerate those who hold a different view this guy is a member of parliament in England... how is he linked to state capture... @redriger ‚úåüèø‚úåüèødanki Makhosi danki African National Criminals... African National Corruption... African National Charlatans... Pravin is the one who enabled state capture... he was Fund Raiser in Chief during CR17 campaign... all ANC policies wont be implemented because of Jamnandas part of the plan "Pretorius is calm today because witness is ... but if the witness was African "Zondo must call Nomula Makonyane between Guptas and Rupert who are the biggest looters "i wont be surprised if Rupert
keletso letsoalo,1.5 trillion lost he is a former uk minister i guess at the end of the day is still a witness in a state capture.
Cerebis,Peter Hain w He headed up the organisation HART during Apartheid Thapelo blocked Why is the Chair so mute today? "SA did actually have a previous agreement with the UAE for an extradition treaty. ... Although the Guptas are from India "SA wants to leave the ICC @Jabu Malinga Playing golf with Schabir Shaik??
Thapelo Motabogi,"i don't trust any white person who live in britain "he knew about these things but did nothing at that time did corruption start with zuma "we can't talk about anything in this country and not include race "@Elvis Malakoane  the only reason this guy came here is because JZ didn't take orders from britain like some of our puppet leaders "@Person of interest  "every country in the world that has shares in this country "the problem @Person of interest you leak information "when this guy goes back to britain "i feel like i'm listen to SA FM with this guy talking what about stienhof mr peter what what "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU steinhof has so many companies under it's belt "some people just comment here "the topic her is corruption @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU  i never said helo "sounds like this guy is here to tell zondo commission what to do please that is done by most white companies registering as a black owned business
Thelsa,This foreigner has recolonized the rot going on in this country by Government officials. Our own people could not see this. They were too blinded by the millions flying into their faces "He is not a South African. He is a British citizen. He was only born in South Africa. He went to the UK from South Africa as a teenager
elaine norris,"Thelsa "thapelo "If you are born here you are a South African thats why this country will remain in the poverty it is in because of people with your bad attitude Thapelo "I agree Elvis This guy didn't have to give up his time and come here for us!! "Eliot because he is attacking us "I don't tolerate idiots
Sandy Meszaros,"Yes we can
Pikolomzi Hlabahlaba,He was born in Nairobi Kenya.
Raymond Fitzgerald,elvis carry on u at least have your head screwed on well done again Elvis u are soo right well done and thank u what woo makhosi u are soo well advertised to this thank u soo much
James Godloza Godloza,some people don't understand the effects of corruption in this country and are still trying to cover for ubaba kaduduzane. yes corruption did not start with zuptas yet they have escalated corruption agreed Pastor J "Thapelo just listen first and then comment whether negative or positive Sir Elliott it's not a different view it's straight dumbest view sorry @Noxolo we should just call a spade a fork
Sello Lebaka,The amount generalization here is shocking!!
Wayward,lol "Even banks in South Africa (Stander bank) wont help you if you were swindled and money payed in to the crooks account @makhosi LOL @Sthakathi Please... I love the block function
Noxolo Tshabangu,Please let us stop insulting each other @Leizl Eykelhof please üôèüèæ @james calling a spade a shovel or spade is neither here nor there... you aught to always reflect your best humanity to the world...
Leizl Eykelhof,"James Godloza Godloza ‚Äã I think you are correct... if we just listen to each other and give each other a chance to talk
Akhona Gala,@Elneamo.... he doesn't have a point Oom Tom was an Iceboy üòÇüòÇthey were telling him what to do
Easy D,"Yes exactly @ Stronger togather.. Yes a new one to me also @ Person of interest.. "@ pastor J well it helps and the comment was accurate..@ Pastor J "The Guptas is using the money in the suitcase "@ Keith Sindile
Sthakathi Khumalo,The real capture is happening as we speak!! This Gupta one is a smoke screen. "Do not forget this is a British Politician "Pravin hired David Mabuza who has since made a loss of 25billion and counting under a year at Eskom The only problem Zuma did was to work against white capital.. look at Dudu Myeni right now. She is being blamed for things done by Colemen Andrews at SAA Go google Bain and Coleman Andrews!! Go look at Hawks dossiers clearing Dudu and stop looking at certain media narratives and taking them as facts Peter Staffen Just go and read. SAA owns c. 9 planes & lease 60 planes! dossier clears Dudu Myeni & directly implicates former SAA‚Äôs American turn around strategist Coleman Andrews Peter Staffen Who is getting richer?? makhosi nobhatyi Funny enough same investigation was done by a French investigating body which investigated competition and corruption in the airline industry. Thats where the evidence came from "redriger They have protectors like Trevor "Pastor J The problem is that these facts seem to chase one person "Hendrine de Wet Struggle credentials do not scare us Whats in it for them in African countries thats the point.. You never see us investigating them He must also help us bring back the many gold stollen by the QUEEN!! "Eliot Chauke ITS LORD HAIN after all "David Tuer we have been saying the but seems we are hallucinating Thapelo Motabogi That is so true! "UK that Can we move to another witness now!!
Charel Schickerling,bull! Better to ignore some of these ignorant comments proof is all that matters ....
Keith Hodgson,"I know this is
Peet Venter,Oeps Moyane!
Jabu Malinga,"its easy to spot a smere campaign. If som1 is accused of stealing and another of giving som1 early pension "there is maybe 20 or less "this guy seems noble "guptas hav the money tangled in soo many names and places SA was too stupid.they let guptas leave. how can thieves be allowed to leav there are others stealing and leaving. Iqbal Surve will be the next to run away were is anoj singh? is tom moyane in prison? "6 billion PIC monies given to Iqbal Surve. yes
TRUST EES,Lord Peter Hain anti-apartheid campaigner in the 1970s.
Mbulelo Maquba,it there system they know it if you do not understand politics you will say that . we are not Zuma supporters we are black transformation people it happen Zuma is a lead you are blocking him to transform Africa . ramaposa is not corrupt bossa guys BCS he is white in a black skin
AfriNaak,"Lord Peter Hain who?..the amout of insight knowledge this old man from Enland has for our country for me its kinder awkward and scary
Arnie Naidoo,any zuma supporters here??? Zumpie army making their final stand even after a bloodied defeat
PETER STAFFEN,Sthakathi Khumalo now were did you read this rubbish Sthakathi Khumalo now how did you get hold of the HAWKS files "Sthakathi Khumalo and somebody is getting rich on the leases that were signed  makhosi nobhatyi well said Sthakathi Khumalo please use the brain cell you have got
Christiaan du Plessis,Zuma used white capital as a smoke screen to steal money from the poor to enrich himself and his cronies. And some people praised him. Sthakathi then why does Dudu not come testify at the commission if she is innocent? She is hiding Eliot the Guptas because they are criminals and the almost broke SA. Rupert is a fat rich cat but at least he helps to grow the SA economy.
Ntusa Kassange,"Corruption has no colour what is happening here is not fight against corruption but showing that certain people should not be corrupt only those who really have the power. yes those are the ones that should be prosecuted too example many business owners and in SA are involved in Criminal tax avoidance this is what im talking about
TAF,v
Thato Nkadimeng,implicating states
Mzalwane Mzala,@Sthakathi Khumalo Only one dodgy publication published about that dossier in 2018. There is no such dossier. @makhosi nobhatyi Hawks did not release such a dosier.
Lehlogonolo Seoketse,I like how the witness refers to the guptas as criminals
Paul Buchel,One of the Guptas houses was auctioned this morning for 2.6 million. "Incredible man Lord Hain "@Bianca Arnold @Bianca Arnold Correct. @redriger‚Äã HE HEüòÇüòÇü§£

Hendrine de Wet,"Sthakathi KhumaloYou may not born to remember this history - Peter Hain was an activist against the apartheid government "Sthakathi Khumalo I don't see him being here as wanting to scare anyone. As he said "Sthakathi Khumalo I believe that he is still wanting to help all of us setting our country on the right path
Thami Ngwenya,"Sthakathi Agree @Thando
KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,Hey @Bianca Arnold @Bianca Arnold üòÉ "Who's this guy @Pastor J Oh wow... the legendary Peter Hain.

We're so weak ...or.... our leaders minds process information or thoughts like the year 2004/5 dial up internet ... which used to take whole day to download pdf "@redriger Set an example "Police drive around in town How is policing in your town @redriger How's policing in your town @redriger ? Hahahaha "Gosh
Rob Nel,perhaps he remembers evrything??
Jeffrey Kangara,who is this african
Cedrick Mabogo,I like this witness he wants action
David Tuer,I fail to see why Peter Hain is explaining to the commission how State Capture worked and who was responsible. He has said that he has gleaned his knowledge from public sources. There is nothing new. @Bianca Arnold. He says not. Bianca. He is talking about a generalised view of corruption. The commission is about State Capture of South Africa. "Yes Bianca Well at least we agree on something Bianca. "Wow Granit Xhaka The best way to persuade bankers to be more careful is to put a few of them into jail. "Crumbs
