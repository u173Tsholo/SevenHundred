Aubrey De Bliquy,"@Kelly Jurgens Exactly And the pensioners trying to save the unicerse via our keyboards. universe @M Place Didn't Zuma say he was attending a funeral today and Zondo say it's OK? or did I hear wrong? "@Vusumuzi G Khambane Thanks Was it that funeral of the Head of the institute of Chartered Accountants he attended? I did not see him there unless the cameras avoided him. Just pray for Zondo. It is because of times like these that men of strong moral integrity grace our bench. I think the commission is nearly finished its work. If the recusal fails Zuma will just be recorded as a hostile witness which will just make him look more guilty. covid is a scam it has more in common with medieval superstition than science. "20 @M Place Zuma is not the accused and this is not a trial. You sound like the Queen of Hearts in Alcie in Wonderland. LOL OFF WITH HER HEAD!!! Alice Is there no sound or is my PC on mute? It was on mute. LOL "R10 @Milton Taju The commission is just part of a process of accountable government under law without which neither Zuma not Malema nor CR can save what is left of this country. "So when I hear mischief making politicians spouting hatred between South Africans based on race or other arbitrary criteria "There is no shame in running from the Apartheid state Are they running away or to a meeting? This is epic history in the making and the world is watching state capture South African style. Actually I think ​Sikhakhane put up a valiant effort on a losing wicket. He must have known this day was coming. He can only do what is possible and after 3 years they have used up all their tricks. This is how the people get their country back. It's called rule of law not jungle. @Luciano Thomo Much more fun than 7de laan The next step if he ran would be a warrant for his arrest after tea. @Muzi Gumede Which specific right of his client is he excercizing by refusing to obey a lawful summons? name just one 15 minute tea break ended 4 minutes ago. eNCA live stream also has a still pic. "9 ​Sikhakhane still keeps forgetting this is an enquiry not a trial. There is no prosecutor and no accused. ​Sikhakhaneis obviously just playing the fol and wasting the commissions time. "Its already a 31 minute tea Why are SABC not running footage of the commissioners empty chair? Zuma flees from state capture hearings. @Muzi Gumede That terminology apples to a trial. Nobody here is on trial. It's an investigation no matter how often ​Sikhakhanerepeats his nonense. He is defying the commission to bring him back in handcuffs. Well its now 59 minutes of te so far. So you mean Zuma is a fugitive from the law?
corrie ferreira,môre almal Hi Teunis van Ree Gaan ons iets hoor vandag nie alweer nie wat nou hy het gewen hy kap hulle nou

LESLY MOTLOUTSI,if Zondo recuse himself the whole commission is likely to be doomed given the loopholes that might be created if he not present particularly with this key current witness Mr JZ @Heather Durr you are right Courage and strength is another factor he(Zondo) needs @Aubrey De Bliquy
Afroxone AirB&B,waiting eagerly. hope Zondo carries on. we can't have this commission collapsing because of one man.

"@Joshua Mudenda it is not a trial Apparently he only has 15 fans that are willing to chant for him

Kelly Jurgens,"@Philip head of intelligence but to me why fight back for taking the stand on the state of capture?there is alooooot he is hiding @Mashudu he is part of the equation but he was also fighting against NWO. disgusting to see her Zuma fell asleep as Zondo stated his facts.

NTSAKANE MACHITELA,let's it begin when is tough he alwys runs to his chambers
Barbara Sattler,"JZ forgot his mask sound Take Zuma's passport away. Zuma will not return to this commission after today. He will carry on with ducking and diving. "Zuma has defied the Constitutional Court "Where is the Receiver of Revenue? If Zuma can afford this lawyer he can afford to pay his tax arrears yey!!!! "Passport ag shame ping pong game start writing a summons. When the lawyer arrives in his office it's on his desk. Dirty washing. Don't excuse them. please continue Zuma has forgotten his walking stick. Mr. Pretorious will stick to his version. Only Mr. Zondo can overrule him. Mr. Zondo can't excuse Zuma.

Emmanuel Nyatlo,Zondo must reinstate Pravin Gordan to come and testify... In South Africa when you speak about radical transformation and transformation of Land without compensation you are charged . WMC ....
Deon Kotze,More ALTA.. 8000 watching skelm zume 11 000 watching how zuma is sweating All these Zuma bots wasting their data...LOL Zondo so clever Zuma is not coming back after tea they keep the mic on so nobody can steal it Piet Vast you the man! Stole the cameras again!!
bruinman,Zuma's legal team got their tails up. It will soon be between their legs..... DCJ Zondo late again with no consequences. Typical government employee. DCCJ Zonod have a frog in his throat. Sounds very emotional It is obvious that judgement was not written by DCJ Zondo @Andre Terre Blanche Was written by SC Adv. Pretorious @Moabi With a V please "C'on DCJ Zondo CDCJ Zondo only have 24 years experience as Judge while Zuma have experience of a lifetime being corrupt Adv Pretorius SC did his homework Welll done Adv Pretorius!
Listo,@Milton Taju don't you have work to do? @Milton Taju I believe the commission is not there to solve problems that's my view @Avis Yetti who you going with? @Dominic Przybylski 😂 "Zuma has been in these kind of situations before nothing new DCJ is not looking happy today hahahahha Was Zondo appointed by Zuma?? "To me it doesn't make sense for Zuma to mention that they were friends hahahahh Zuma is already having it @RM 👌 "20 seconds to self distraction """A judge is entitled to ask questions"" indeed" "Sikhakhane ""I've noted the judgment"" hahahhahahha" He saw it coming no doubt
Pastor J.J,I see a Skelm on my Screen. "@Avis Yetti I presume yo are talking about the same Musi that copied @Teunis van Ree @Heather Durr Blessed greetings to you both I see 2 Skelms on my screen.

Kevin Simon,If you think this is only a domestic issue. Watch the rand if all this goes south today. This is a pivotal moment as it may prevent our slide to a Zimbabwe-like outcome. Austin Van Rensburg BLOCKED Basically laying out the case that JGZ has reneged on all previous agreements to provide answers . Enough time to have raised the issues for recusal. Never did. Now it is a last resort. Spurious. "Muzi Gumede ​MR ZONDO 777 BLOCKED Problem is we are judging Zuma by western standards... Sizwe S Blocked Cheers Zuma thinks everyone is his friend. Or they are spies if not. Sikhakhane should appear before this commission with regards to the SARS Rogue unit report. VERY SUSPICIOUS in my view. CD Abrahams Poor man ​SKHAKHANE Speaks well but too emotional. Not enough emphasis on facts.
JS Bach,Morning all you lovely people! Stop laughing Zuma! @Diane Louw his daughter More @ALTA My senuwees is klaar!! He has fallen asleep. I wish I can give him a kick to wake him up. "There you go. Thank you Zondo forever!!! Halaaaaaalaaaaaa DCJ Zondo!!!!!! Zondo forever!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Muzi is peed off...... JAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!! Halaaaalaaaaa laduuuuuma!!!! Sour Sikhakane Yes DCJ!!!!!

Adv Skhakhane wants to appeal the judgement right there with DCJ as if its a debate 😅 Zuma will not testify. He will seek other avenues to delegitimize this Commission He didnt wanna recuse. Now yal think yal r excused. It dont work that way "Now Zuma can be certain DCJ AINT YOUR FRIEND Zuma got himself an excellent lawyer. But he is an orator.

Caroline Hawanga,I really hope dcj will dismiss the recusal application Team Zondo forward we move:goodvibes: DAARSY!!!!!!!
Sphelele Nqabeni,Zuma trying by all means to collapse the State capture after government spent billions on the forum. life will humb;e you. we normally wait for Zuma to make a speech now Zuma is waiting for DCJ. his name is Applicant today Zuma and his faithfool supporters will have to appeal because DCJ is not going anywhere. Zuma will eventually give evidence at the Zondo commission with Zondo Chairing the commission. even a strong Zulu Muti wont help the Applicant here why is Sikhakhane crying Rumours are that Zondo is locked up in chambers by an unknown person

Dominic Przybylski,We are all boiled frogs regardless of race. Blocking EFF trolls results in an intelligent discussion. "@V ""The Worm"" excellent name." "The worm is to arrogant to say ""in case I incriminate myself"". We will hear more wild conspiracies if he testifies." "The 'hero' who sings ""bring me my machine gun"" is too much of a coward to answer a few questions." Is Hulley still in SA or is he in Dubai? The worm will be hiding underground with Ace in his nkandla bunker. The worm knows that his side of the story will condemn him to prison. If they put Zuma into a cage at Pollsmor prison he could become a tourist attraction. The true face of a cowardly worm who pretended to be a hero. Most of the effs here are not South Africans. I want to see what Asset Forfeiture Unit pulls out of the Nkandla bunker. @Humphrey What makes you think whites are supreme? @Humphrey You should really try to get over your inferiority complex. It's not healthy. Can somebody please fix their kettle.

Bavuyile Melane,I wanna hear the DCJ is gonna say today oh hey look the Baba is here I think Zuma's attorneys have a problem with the advocates and not the Zondo. they advocates do the questioning and probing. they want Zuma to b asked in a manner different from that of Kwinana who is that lady that he's trying to charm k. LETS ALL BE QUIET QUIET EVERYBODY """I'm a sole member of the commission """ oh yeeeeeeeeeh NO RECUSAL for ZUMA where are the Zuma supporters now Zuma's attorney trying to pick a meaningless argument now DISMISSED RECUSAL DISMISSED RECUSAL "IS IT MY EYES Zuma can't be powerful now as in the days when he was president. he has to ansa to what happened as far as taxpayers money is concerned in his association with the GUPTAS. SOUTH AFRICA NEEDS TO KNOW! His lawyer said something about applying to another institution. did I hear him correctly 🤔 "I loved ZONDO when he said ""I am the sole member of the commission"" right in the beginning of his ruling. I knew that very moment that ZONDO is not going anywhere." the ZUMA supporters now have a problem with the advocates being white WHAT IF HE COMMITS SUICIDE GUYS? @v they dont read them

State capture was started by the racist Apartheid regime Zuma must refuse to attend any further appearance at the commission and allow the commission to implode. The Zondo commission is nothing else but a Zuma witch hunt. Zuma must now appeal to the high court. "Yes Zondo serves Boers. Just walk out before the adjournment Zuma. Now is the time to show the middle finger to Zondo and his witch hunt WMC commission. "Kiss De Boer Get De Klerk to come and testify of apartheid regime state capture Mandela was weak and a sellout and allowed the Boers to get away.

Dr Petrus Dumisa,It is sadining to notice how people will support a curruption including a fantastic corrupt former president. We support the commission charperson and he should stay to conclude his work. Zuma is a citizen of South Africa and must face the consequence of his actions including continued friendship with corrupt individuals. Strongly hands off the DCJ Zondo There is nothing wrong in loving the man. But that is not enough that he should appear and give his side of the story to the commission Well articulated the DCJ to dismiss the application You do not have to be a lawyer to see that there is no basis for complaints South Africans are eager to hear his testimonies to the allegation against him. He must answer the questions and present his version. We do miss Trevor Noa a lot.

Ewert Maseko,South Africa is a constitutional democracy. You don't wake up and ask the Judge to recuse himself just because you are failing in your duty to safe your client from possible prosecution. Chief Justice cant recuse himself from this matter as there are reasonable grounds to that.

DCJ - You've done South Africa PROUD! Thank you! Get up Adv S! Champagne for DCJ and Adv P! Stalingrad ad nauseaum "You can't excuse yourself Equal before the law Stalingrad cul de sac - straat loop dood. The applicant is not amused. The summons stands! Love it! Deal decisively DCJ. Please don't allow bad precedents to be set. Maybe trying to bribe DCJ! Love how DCJ and Adv P stay totally calm!! Recusal application is dismissed. Zondo a natural born Judge! In the end it always comes down to the truth.. Full confidence in DCJ DCJ has his mandate. He is covered all round. simply love the words ' applicant' They're having a working lunch.... 'The applicant has a reasonable apprehension that he may be arrested. ' DCJ is legally obliged to act decisively. The applicant has run out of road. The applicant's brinkmanship will backfire badly... DCJ has the love and respect of South Africa. That's powerful stuff. ' We will excuse ourselves from proceedings' Indeed. ' The commission will resume after lunch'. We can't keep having these delays. Taxpayer money is funding the Commission. DCJ please act decisively. No way they can 'excuse themselves from proceedings ' without consequences... Aikona. ....eventually you have to face up to things... Simple. Answer the questions.

Watch Adv Sikhakhane telling DCJ that Adv is patronizing or him being very dismissive and condescending towards the DCJ. This is his pattern. Very predictable. "If Adv Sikhakhane cannot balance emotion and reason in his professional role "The Commission has really being tremendous to open our eyes about the depth of corruption in this country Concerning is the abominable behaviour displayed by Sikhakhane towards the DCJ. He has no right to undermine and taunt the DCJ in this manner. Disgraceful on his part. He does not respect boundaries.
