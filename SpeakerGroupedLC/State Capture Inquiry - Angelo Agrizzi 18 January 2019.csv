Scyaa Glad's,I'm with you @kargo karas
William Pieters,well said @Cargo Karas We want a Khoisan President next.
douglas gwambe,ANC ANC ANC CORRUPT CORRUPT CORRUPT ANC preconference now please to explain this nonsense to the nation.
G_man,how many people have volunteered to testify so far?
Prescott Smith's Fly Fishing Academy,I am watching from The Bahamas. I hope South Africans vote for the EFF PARTY. the freedom of Blacks all over the world are depended on them winning note Europeans and even most persons of Indian decent are all voting against the EFF. this should show blacks that they are not interested in Africans being in control of their Land & MINERALS kargo I am only telling you what we see from all over the World to vote anything other than EFF it means blacks all over the will remain oppressed for land and mineral sciences. "cargo karas who to vote for that will bring equality for Africans? note from the Berlin Conference in 1884 Africa and it's people Toni John note I ask Cargo who to vote for that will bring freedom for Africans from those who are only their to exploit Africa & her people for their land and MINERAL RESOURCES. Cargo Karos having black skin does not mean a person is not EUROCENTRIC in their thinking. you still have not answered me when it comes to freedom for Blacks. Toni John If EFF win it would mean FREEDOM FOR blacks all over the globe. we have the same mindset of a small GROUP of European BACK who exploit the economy. same throughout the entire region "Cargo Karos EFF winning means it would change the state of Blacks all over the world. The US "Cargo Karos yes I am in The Bahamas Cargo Karos 90 of living things on Earth are are between 30 degrees north and south of the equator. Europe is completely outside of that zone. it's always about land & MINERAL RESOURCES. Dave east I have studied resources globally for over 28 years to understand why we were enslaved & continue to be exploited. it's all because of The Land & MINERAL RESOURCES. Dave east I see what is happening in the DR. none of European countries & The US want to lose control of the mineral in The DR and all through Africa.
Singi Mathebula,who will ever go to jail realy? sickening. 80 at the expense of the black majority. 😭😭 do we have jails for the haves? the answer is no . jails are for the poor absolutely. eff i maseve wa vukungndwana spot on choma its time for the country to consider reviewing the electoral system . this party thing is not taking us any where. yeees teddy
Victor,80??? terrible
Houws Houlinou,@Bulelwa LETICIA Makhanya Do you think people who vote for the ANC also votes against the EFF? @Singi Mathebula The problem is power corrupts @Andre Gerber And a law prohibiting public officials to do business in other areas. Also their finances should be published each year @ramotodi moraba But the EFF is part of the judicial committee appointing judges @Toni john Nothing is free. You will be paying for it when you start your job and start paying tax You are scr#wed if you think any party is going to bring positive things into your life. Everyone in the private industry knows you won't get any business from government if you don't pay bribes @Elloise Jofriet It is because we look at each other as different races rather than individuals. Governments fail no matter skin color @siyabonga dlamini Agreed. People in power tend to be corrupt. We need to start talking to each other about the problems in this country and leave race at the door Politicians shove millions in their pockets while we normal citizens accuse each other of racism. Great distraction @siyabonga dlamini But I do believe I can make a difference by trying to change the attitude towards different races by being reasonable @Tebogo V The same happens in the white community. Also not just black people @siyabonga dlamini Dr Khotso de Wee @Bruce Thackwell True. Education is key @Bruce Thackwell We would solve so many problems @Mzalwane Mzala But he is part of the commission who is inquiring about exactly what he is part of @Mzalwane Mzala Its like appointing a cop to solve a murder case he himself commited @siyabonga dlamini yes helping . . . not hardening hearts against each other @Thomas Dube The sooner you realize that political parties are not there to serve the people the better you are off. They are ALL there to serve themselves Always question their motives because it is NEVER pure @Phillip Moshapo That is why we need the ANC in government with less than 50% so that the opposition has more power to keep them to account @Thando Nkutha We don't need new guys with empty pockets @Thando Nkutha I'm saying we should grow the opposition. Mental slavery is to give ANY party all the power to do as they please without consequence @Thando Nkutha The problem is SA cannot give ALL the power to the next party to only be corrupt. We don't learn. We want to punish the ANC by giving all power to the EFF. Same problem @Thando Nkutha Yes the ones found guilty for sure. But you don't want to understand what I am saying about any ruling party @Thando Nkutha Tell me who is going to hold the next ruling party to account if they are voted in with 67% majority? They will also just do as they please and vote against any form of investigations @Thando Nkutha Don't insult me. I've not insulted you @Thando Nkutha I never once voted for the ANC @Thando Nkutha So tell us which party cares? @Thando Nkutha Is it because you don't know? @Thando Nkutha So tell us. You cannot claim to know and then not answer out of fear that you are going to be pointed out as a hypocrite @Thando Nkutha You call others stupid but you cannot grasp even what I am trying to say. Don't give ANY ruling party a majority of 67%. How do you NOT get that? Opposition parties are there to keep ANY ruling party in line - to be held accountable The EFF and ANC are the same party. @Thando Nkutha It is the truth. It @Thando Nkutha There are many more parties to choose from. Why limit only three with the most flaws? @Thando Nkutha The opposition collectively will be a certain percentage no matter the winner. That is what is important - more important than who is on top Like when there was a vote of no confidence against Zuma. He would have been long gone if the opposition was more than the ANC @Thando Nkutha We all are thinking also about our children mam @Tholithemba Ntsele EXACTLY!

Mzalwane Mzala,Which politicians have been mentioned as corrupt so far? Dudu Myeni is not a politician @Cargo Karas Politicians are bared fromm being bardmembers of SOEs. @Cargo Karas SOEs are state owned enterprizes. BREAKING: Zondo commission secretary implicated in Bosasa corruption "News24 can report that Agrizzi will name De Wee as a recipient of cash payments relating to a 2008 tender awarded to Bosasa subsidiary This is in return for a 2008 contract awarded to Sondolo IT which was worth roughly R600-million for the provision of CCTV and access control systems at DOJ buildings around the country and courts. This practice was also applied when Sondolo IT/GTS was awarded a R400-million contract in 2011 to provide physical guarding at the same court buildings and National Prosecuting Authority offices. "Dr Khotso de Wee @Thomas Dube What is disappointing? @Thomas Dube The ANC has many members and not all of them are angels. Individuals will beheld to account and the ANC grows stronger. The MEC of North West is ANC We are cleaning the Zuma mess. 10 years of Zuma ANC presidency. Northwest under Supra.... North West province @Thomas Dube A former ANC chairperson in the Northern Cape is serving 15 years in jail right now. The ANC will not drop below 60% in these elections. Among the many names the only ANC politician that has been mentioned so far is the lady MEC of Northwest. Yes @Andre Gerber . Remind me if I missed any name @Andre Gerber What was said about them in this comission? @Andre Gerber What was the allegation of corruption? We are voting ANC and it does not bother us that people who never supported the ANC pretend that they were once with us. We won elections convincingly without them before. We have been insulted in 1994 and the ANC still got 64% electoral support. Being insulted by few haters does not affect the ANC. All polls point to an ANC victory There were insults against ANC members in 1999 and still the ANC won elections by 66.35%. @Andre Gerber The people can sift and they will see through your attempts to make this about the ANC.

Bruce Thackwell,there is no such thing as Black and White people! These are racist terms. No one with an ounce of intelligence would identify themselves with these terms. What a disappointing human condition. Yes Siyabonga YES! the terms Black and White are peddled by those who want to divide. Can you imagine what a great people we would be without these ridiculous terminology. Don't think you are unique to racism. Thats another cop out. All people in Africa Suffer from poverty in fact South Africans are better off than most Africans. You should find the real reasons. "Where I hail from is not important Elloise Dave South Africans are the best off people in Africa so please identify the real causes liberate your mind 8% of people cannot possibly enslave. Its impossible "Still doing the White Black thing Siyabonga Britton was colonised more than 30 times get over it Siyabonga there are no such things as whites greys and Blacks. Better people call people by name Dave shame always generalise and always blame someone else I know your type too well "Dave "Rule of thumb...dont vote for any party who identifies as ""Comrade"" its means Corruption in Russian" The ANC has brainwashed you Dave Thando is ignorant just ignore him Houws!
