Eric Belle,Hi Gideon Maboyi i have no idea too
Mandla Silubana,Suzanne daniels brilliant indeed she is starting to sing now
Aubrey De Bliquy,is this happening? 🙏 Hey @Thobani Mkananda How you doing? I was just answering the doorbell. 🙂 I see live in 63 minutes. Time for a cup of coffee...☕ What a kind and professional gentleman this Zondo. When doez President Zuma give testimony? You have a school? I think our schools are filled with the 25000 we allow find greener pastures here every year. @Joshua Borias The way we are doing it now. one painful and methodical step at a time. "Please
Thobani Mkananda,@Aubrey du Bliquy Morning my brother 🙏🏾 "@Lucky Thwala You're right. He'll come back during the course of the day. Suzanne has been rescheduled a lot @Julia Borias Greetings too my brother @Owen Nyilika That's still unclear. I still believe it's Essa... It's because the email exchange began around June 2016 and Seleke joined in December 2016. Ms. Daniels will hopefully clear that @Multi_African You mean Adv. Seleka? @Cool Kruger 😂Your exposé is noted by the commission and the admission of guilt as well 🤣 @Blake Yogi People still don't understand how counsels are delegated to deal with specific matters... @Ntokozo Nhlapho 🤣😂🤣🤣 @Hlagala Masetlale Order!! 🤣😂🤣🤣 SELEKA 🤣 """I must declare for grammar "" Ms. Daniels 🤔" "@Blake Yogi it's the same as 'I CAN'T RECALL' which is tiring "@Eric Sithole @Diketso Moyo He's somewhere with the Guptas. Possibly around UAE @Eric Sithole He's referred to as Baba 🤣😂 @Owen Nyilika I missed something. Did Ms. Daniels confirmed your point that it belonged to Mr. Seleke @Owen Nyilika At last this pseudonym has a real name and a real face(s) attached to it 🙏🏾😊 @Owen Nyilika 😂🙆🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ It's still not quite cut and dry... Who's businessman? 🤔 "Why did Adv Seleka smile after saying ""You need to sanitize it"" for 5 Marks 😂🤣😂" "@Hlagala Masetlale When you blow a whistle because the rules of game have developed and are disenfranchising you @Makhosi Nobhatyi Welcome my brother 😊🙏🏾💥 "@Rudolph Cele He already testified but should the commission see a need to come back "The viewership numbers are increasing @Ozzy Ozzy Interesting 😂🤣 @Mandla Tshabalala Welcome to you too my brother 🤣😂 I'm sorry about the sound experience next door. You're welcome at any point in this community 🤣😂 @Yolo More @Ntokozo Ngcobo It looks like it. We are a welcoming community so everyone is welcome to share their views openly. . . 😂🤣 @Lucky Benya She's pathetic "@People from next door Done Sorry about that @Angelo Doubel Please don't cast aspersions on the visitors. Please remain hospitable 🤣😂🤣 Ms. Daniels Why are you doing this mara? She's overthinking about what to say. Is she hiding something? @Zicelo Sokhela It would clarify some elements in her demeanor. Adv. Ngcukaitobi is a quick thinker... SILENCE """With respect Chair "@Ntokozo Ngcobo if she'd just get the nerves in check """. . .An issue that has always been on my mind..."" Ms. Daniels Since when?" @Wally 🤣😂🤣😂🙆🏾‍♂️😅 We've hit 4.5k Thanks everyone 😂🤣 Thanks to @Enca for borrowing us your audience @Russia Magezi True but it won't be preferred in law to term it that 😂 @Mr A What I found interesting is how she struggled with that simple question. . . She overthinks and in that incriminate herself @Makabongwe Mgubela Eish I'm afraid it's rather too late for that advice...😂🤣 @Akhonamandla Gasa Bro! She forgot she said that!! Welcome back my friend 🤣🙏🏾 """But that is strange"" DCJ R Zondo 🤣😂😂🤣" """in ensuing days"" meaning in subsequent days 🙆🏾‍♂️"

Dont upset ubaba I like the sound chair makes when he starts connecting the dots and asking questions "When they make that sound I agree she makes it feel like she is more guilty than being a whistleblower Damning testimony though. Tjo Adv Seleka. You are brilliant Seat getting hotter now 🔥🔥🔥 She is guilty too. thats what it appears to be. She is on the fence. Where is the info? Maybe she also got a fat slice of pie @ Ms G did you hear Chair 😄 @ Gift I agree. she is supposed to be whistleblowing but she is fihlaing She got Cold drink thats why she cant recall anything 😱😱😱 Haaibo That connects all the dots
Sakhile Mbokane,He’s going to come back later in the second round @Lucky Not sure if someone has noticed or said this; the Advocate’s mannerisms and accent is similar to Tyson Ngubeni ( comedian on the Chicken Licken advert) 😅

L Ll,So they all had the same password for the email address? Tebogo obviously because you cannot have details of an email you have nothing to do with If you are meeting up with someone you discuss where to meet! That’s what normal people do 😳 Let’s meet at the restaurant at 1pm that sounds right innit?

Gift Mazibuko,It is an obvious that the so called businessman has always been Mr. Saleem Essa and Miss. Daniels alwaysknwe this . It is obvious that the so called business man has always been Sallem Essa. Ben Ngubane knew this ans so did Miss. Daniels. . She is not a skillful liar. This Melrose Arch has the same reputation as Saxon world. Is where all the elite corrupt met to coclude dodgy dealings.
