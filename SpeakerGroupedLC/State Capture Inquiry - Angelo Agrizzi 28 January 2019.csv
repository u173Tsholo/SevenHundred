Dams daily motivations Madamalala,Ndaa! Mr Agrizzi i checked my status
Sindiswa Moolman,Tony Yengeni told us to fasten our safety belts because a volcano is about to explode. He assured that what we have seen or heard so far is nothing. Molo mtakwethu Ndiyaphila @mandisi ntauzana. Unjani wena? He is also selling his R13.5m house. Leshabane pocketed the money. "The story written by one of the journos mentioned here ""Mmusi Lies Again & Again About Bosasa & The President""." Who is the ANC @MIKE LOCK ? So IDT was part of this whole enterprise. How were these bribes recorded in the financial statements? I think they are on a break @Ewald Kruger Hayibo @Tholithemba Ntsele . Why are you searing now? swearing Ok if utsho ke @Tholithemba Ntsele Very arrogant and sure of herself @Morolo Jay Maponya. Untouchable....

Nelson Musoliwa,Lawful dissemination of news by journalists is of public interest no tjotjo for journalists please impartial reporting for public sake please Intellectualism must suppress gossips between the comm and media by being professional in their duties I do not think we like Agrizzie but we like what he is giving as evidence for he is as guilty as those whom he is testifying against Which outside auditors dealt with Bossasa books
Lebo Nchabeleng,I wonder why didn't He take the money and still come and blow the whistle even more louder He wants to earn billions not millions
peter pott,"@lebo "newspapers are worried "@mandisi "you can be certain it's a white journalist pay attention south Africa how evidence is thrown under carpet. do you think agrizzi is that foolish to give leshabane money without asking the name of the journalist? really?

Kids Collie,I cannot even imagine what would have happened to South Africa if someone didn't come forward and started talking. @Eslon Eslon Not all @Cycles Of Hope It is easy to say that if you are not hungry We should expect more from our leaders. We shouldn't vote for the ones who stole the least money. We should vote those who steal out completely These politicians all protect each other - even across party lines. It is naive to think there are one honourable person among them. @sipho cebo At this moment I hardly think any party can be trusted in South Africa @9Play9Boy9 Stop with this racism man @9Play9Boy9 If you are trying to state what Jesus feels about people are facts then you are delusional man @9Play9Boy9 Just when people start having a positive and reasonable discussion you and other extremists just entice hatred all over again. You contribute NOTHING positive "@9Play9Boy9 ""sigh""" Just when he started talking about Zuma the broadcast cut out Mmmmm @Nicodimus Mojela And Zuma. I hear Julius has forgiven Zuma. Same whatsapp group @Bronx Wavy Go and check on News 24. It is true @Richardt Human Yes maybe privatize all SOE's We need laws that prohibit government officials of conducting business. The should just be allowed to do their job @Bronx Wavy This rory is a troll. He's going to switch sides within a few minutes. Pretends to be white and raicst and then claims to be black and racist @Rori Rory is a black person who wants to anger you and harden your heart toward other races in South Africa. He thinks we are all stupid @Thando Nkutha Rory is a troll. The other day he was doing the same playing the role of a black person. Ignore

Tebogo V,it's all got to with ANC it's all about ANC those who say otherwise are either in denial or brainless "Corruption was first institutionalised inside the ANC Individuals go into the ANC mostly clean but get corrupted by institutional culture of the party hence EFF leaders would find it hard to be corruption free because they were raised in the hotbed of corruption ANC in fact ANC used to canvass membership on a basis that it is a ticket to state resources Bosasa itself was founded by ANC veterans among we count Mapisa Ngqakula Gavin Watson & his brothers were ANC activists in apartheid years "EFF is not Marxist what nonsense is marxist-fanonian- sankarist ideology EFF is a fascist quasi revolutionary force this is ANC institutional tradition on display Malema is just a populist who would do anything to keep his stomach full the EFF would be better with Ndlozi at the helm & without both Floyd & Julius "Floyd & Julius were baptised in ANC corruption "@Masipa I agree with you to some extent Multi party democracy encourages fragmentation of the political space as each one attempts to feed their own stomach notwithstanding that elections become a financial contest of those with deeper pockets not who has better policies or could govern better how many parties do we have in SA today?

9Play9Boy9,the EFF's cardinal pillars are Marxist ideology which has been responsible for HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of deaths across the globe.. anyone with an internet connection can discredit them in 10min @bronx it is only because you have absolutely no idea what your options are and how each of these systems work that you don't want capitalism. @bronx I agree fully! because the 80% will rather have 100% of 10 than 10% of a billion. "the 80% votes according to popular opinion about what people tell them right before elections I haven'tet an economically literate person (someone who understands where money comes from and how the global financial system works) who said they will vote EFF @bronx the people want it because they have absolutely NO idea what it is. if you took 30 min to lightly research what it is (AND have the capacity to understand what you're reading) you would RUN free yourself "stop being a BLACK "because then you are dependant on them! not yourself. you aren't a BLACK "@bronx with one breath you reject the ANC "@bronx again if you are white you can still vote EFF like the color of your skin is all that matters. why I believe we should let the 80% vote EFF and leave them to their own demise.. if you wanna keep voting for idiotic ideology you deserve to suffer and CIC Malema has warned us there is allot of suffering coming for us to take the land and give it all to government and lease the land from them "EFF and ANC are same thing lol who taught you about WMC? the very same people who sell out your rights and services and take bribes from WMC @bronx you mention afriforum but you don't even know who they are or what they do. all you know is your leaders (who are robbing you blind) tell you they are WHITES and you are BLACK. and you listen. "@bronx I do not have a party. I vote DA because I believe that they are not YET as corrupt as the rest. and evidence shows where they govern @bronx blocking someone who has a different opinion is the opposite of intelegence. havent heard one person here mention polocies or substance. because unfortunately people do not have the mental capacity. they vote based on what these people tell them. not their own agency/ research "@holylady Jesus hates blacks @kids what's been racist? facts cannot be racist.. dont be silly. do the research before you impune on my dignity by calling me a racist "@sipho IQ is a measure of mental capacity and it was made by the same people who made every scientific measurement globally @kids it's a very well substantiated scientific argument to which you respond with insults instead of intelegent debate. you argue the man not the argument "the sad thing is your mind emediately reverts back to racist "you don't even know anything about me. don't know where I am "just like you are taught by our corrupt leader. don't vote here because yore BLACK "same thing Apartheid government worked hard to teach you "@nicodimus it's because you believe that people are ""given"". these ""whites"" you speak of font wait to be ""given"" anything "so each individual does their best to contribute and build a better place. there is no ""given""." "@sipho yeah sure @spider you are the one insulting me as a person and not debating or refuting my argument. anyone can do that. your creator is a cruel devil because the fact is that Africa's IQ is half. Google it. @spider saying we are all equal doesn't solve anything. these are complex matters which have to be debated intelegently with substantive arguments not just dumb insults because you disagree. "nowhere on this planet are humans equal in any way shape or form. we don't look equal. we don't speak the same "you cannot have WESTERN benefits (like cellphone "@jack if you thing china is in any way shape or form close to western civilization you are not educated on the topic. "China is an authoritarian nation. you do not have individual rights in China. government monitors and controls EVERYTHING you do.. what you're alowwed to eat @jack yes they have technology but they do not have freedom. @vision saying it doesn't make it true. look at Africa and look at the west. if you think you can reasonably compare Africa to western civilization you are living in a dream world. "@jack. fair "@jack just go read up about China instead of trying to win an argument. choose to educate yourself rather than trying to disprove me just cause you ""feel"" a certain way. that's exactly how people vote" @vision just cause we have a doctor or two doesn't mean anything. LOOK at all of AFRICA. it is a failed continent hanging on to western funds to keep floating. it's a mess. people are suffering. @vision are you saying something? "@vision saying like it or not we are still living in SHAKS after ruling ourselves for 25 years because our leaders are incompetent and corrupt I've raised serious facts and logical arguments. all I've heard are emotive attacks on me and people swearing they will vote a certain based on nothing but what they are told by people in power. because we have a tribal culture and our leaders preach nothing but you are a mindless BLACK instead of an individual who can make up his mind based on facts. @vision we were sold as slaves to the west by ELITE BLACKS. they didn't come and capture free people. they came to BUY slaves "you are reminded every chance by leaders (EFF "if you haven't studied ideological ideas and have a sure understanding of the EFF's cardinal pillars "capitals ms faults are meant to be mitigated by an intelegent capitalism on its own is not worth anything either. "you scream for economic freedom but you have no idea what an economy is I have lost faith in my people. whe will always choose to be the oppressed rather than the Victor's. we will choose to be BLACK rather than individual people. @kids we have the entire English common law. there are laws like that. the problem is the people who are suppose to implement and enforce these laws are stealing corrupt incompetent and uncaring. lol blocking someone will just mean you don't see what they write. it exluced you not them. "again if you don't understand the impact of BEE on an economy - you are not educated enough to vote. educate yourself before you give your children's hopes dreams and land away. always be suspicious of what the people in power tell you is the problem. "don't listen to your leaders who try to decide you so they can stay in power. don't be a BLACK @thami he is allowed becauz free speach is vital to a scoceity. if want to live a free and fair scoceity you cannot disallow someone to raise points you don't agree with.research how free speach works you cannot claim free speach and then disallow people. even if they are trolling. best thing you can do is challenge his points logically or ignore him. alas. I'm out. it's very tiring to try and convince people they are individuals with potential when our leaders work overtime to teach BLACKS and WHITES. @thami you have to allow that otherwise you end up blocking valid points. that's how frees peach works. @thami if you disagree with him that's the very reason you should allow him to speak. our constitution sadly doesn't give us the right to free speach. America is the only place on earth where you can say anything. and it's bacause they have learned from their past. @thami it is so sad that the people taking the bribes from private sector have convinced you that the pro ate sector is at fault. government is responsible for keeping the private sector in line. the very same people we have appointed to regulate the private sector now turn arround and tell us that the private sector or WMC is at fault. when they are the ones taking the bribes from. WMC "this is like blaming the person your spouse sleeps with. instead of blaming your spouse. WMC bribes government and we blame WMC when government themselves I vented the term WMC.. or at least payed a London company (white company) to invent WMC and keep us devided. "it is GOVERNMENTS perpouse/job to keep WMC /private sector in line. now they turn arround and say its the fault of the people they themselves are suppose to be regulating

Paul Mufhadi,white corruptions and black corruptions is all bad for our country. we need leaders with integrity to lead us. All corrupt people should be arrested and throw the key away.

They claim to know nothing and yet they were there zupta took over and they did nothing. These zupta cronies must kiss my vote away. I am really disappointed in the anc black or white it does not matter.all corruption is bad for SA. so let's not make it a black and white issue.
