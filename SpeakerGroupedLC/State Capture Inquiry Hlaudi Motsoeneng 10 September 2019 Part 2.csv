No 1,TaxPayers Money - Rap Up and Jail sentence!! Even the Police Force Minimum Requirements Matric - and so how many of them have a Matric?? The Reason they won't let go of the Matric aspect!

Derick Mampuru,but what was so difficult to complete the matric or maybe I just don't understand what was difficult about completing matric 🤷🏽‍♂️ "I think George is trying to say ""they've hired me "he needs to come back tomorrow "I love the way he's so comfortable with everything George never lied... Period!!! 🤣🤣
Born free,What talent did he possess to be head hunted?.. I think he was Alvin Kloppers garden boy. Bring back colonization Today you will pass with F Especially with the likes of Zuma.. no-one needs Matric or qualifications . Zuma set a precedence. So his highest Matric Symbol was an E..eish.. I think it is an exemption today 🤣🤣🤣😁 "Combine his symbols.. E He failed matric dismally and never wrote again Outstanding.. meant they were waiting for his matric certificate. His sin is the desperate state of affairs in SABC 😆😆😆🤣🤣😅😅😄 That's why he is the Former COO Ahh Shame he has come along way.. dreams can come true. I but all my degrees I buy all my degrees I fly for SAA but I bought my pilots license I could not pass my aviation exam so I paid for the certificate Trump has created millions of jobs and has the greatest economy in the world.. you cannot compare our leaders to Trump. Don't insult Trump. Reverand Rawhide.. c Reverand Rawhide.. Can you notice the deterioration? Trump victory 2020 All SOEs are bloated including the ANC government. He was appointed by the Guptas The Guptas governed the government Guptas were share holders Capture the private sector.. repeat that.. Vegetable curry Currying Favour Bean Curry Why would America want to play African music. Nutter of note Ban Malema. Don't waste footage on Malema Smart 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣 Julius going to jail soon So he does not want the truth to be aired on TV You cannot glamourise people being killed and dying on the streets.
Derek Main,"@Derick Mampuru Exactly - if Hlaudi is as smart as he keeps on claiming @This Is Balls There is Orania for people like you. @Xoli Mbatha But not at the position he was employed - only at much lower levels. @Thando Nkutha Even not-so-intelligent people pass matric. @Thando Nkutha We can't advocate a situation where board members don't need to have matric. That is the absolute minimum they require. @Thando Nkutha What's the point of wasting your time getting a matric then? @Thando Nkutha OK - playing the devil's advocate. I like it! 😀 "@Thando Nkutha I agree that matric is not the be-all-and-end-all. However @Jabu Malinga Or because he's corrupt enough to meet the ANC's criteria. @Geraldine Gaggia Maybe you should apply to SABC for a job? Hlaudi was too dumb to even buy a matric. @Sthakathi Khumalo Sure - if the SABC is privatised. Glaramotise? @Thando Nkutha I can - it rhymes with Cloudy. "@Thando Nkutha It's difficult to type the ""Hl"" bit" This brand of censorship is exactly how the Nat government argued for their censorship. This was why journalists were not allowed to cover protests during apartheid. He learnt well from the Nats.
Xoli Mbatha,Apparently there were others hired without their matric qualifications ...he was initially head-hunted for a different lower level post "...as mentioned he was encouraged to pursue his metric qualification thereafter Matric I've obtained my 2nd matric certificate! Just by listening to this live-stream🤞 😵😵😵 @Oratile Masipa definitely...he was hired in the correct industry😂😂😂 "His experience thereafter may have qualified him for the COO position considering there are programs like the ""Recognition of Prior Learning"" offered by Unisa" """Recognition of Prior Learning"" recognizes one's working experience to beef-up one's qualification status." "Some people...""money likes them"" @Jabu Malinga correct! 😂😂😂 ...now the juicy part💃 True about local-content✌look at channel 157😂😂😂 @Shadrack Dichaba 💃💃💃
JS Bach,It is one thing not to have a formal qualification. Many people do not have the opportunity to attain one. But it is a different ball game to be a crook and a skelm. "He You people make my day with all your jokes about the curry......😂😂😂😂😂 I wonder what Judge Z is going to tell his wife about his day at work today..... @bonginkosi masiwa HE doesn't know himself! Why doesn't he wear his hat today? "@EDWARD LEGONG you are soooooo right!! Trump "@dino ceegage Well
sebatlelo michael,corporate governance paralysis at SABC under the watch of Ben Ngubani
Kevin Simon,"Back in '96 and earlier it was not uncommon to employ people without matric. However "If I was part of the interview team STOP PASSING the BUCK!!!!!! YOU lied about the symbols as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! """Catched the fish Is there any clarity on the qualifications required to call oneself a journalist? Hlaudi no expounding on his knowledge of the elements of price theory. Wasn't a matric subject though. I don't think HGM understands...… Sad. Lets hear his research theory ITs called CENSORSHIP. Yes you are wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Violent protests are not the same as gratuitous violence. Anyone who agrees with him is now a follower. Saviour of souls
fikile mbokodi,hahaha shame this guy is a clown hahaha zondo you coming to it now he did write but he never passed it no he doesnot have because there is no certificate no they dont i mean they do hahaahah hahaah woow withdraw hahah why this guy is here kanti hayi this leader failed shame hofmeyer must question him again please adv norman failed today they must sop him now and continue with the business of theday he did not answer the question
Pastor J.J,@Thando Nkutha . My brother i think you picking on me again. The part of the idiots who have degrees......hahahaha forgiven It is said....that the majority of Educators will not write and pass most Matric examinations....... @Geraldine Gaggia What work do you do now? @born free.....where from? I need 3 more degrees He is talking about the IRONING BOARD this Moegoe @Thando Nkutha The Board. IRONING BOARD OR CARDBOARD. Take your pick Thando @Slindile Ngcobo Yes. They got 2 votes from Hlaudi and Hlaudi=2.. His family voted for someone else. @Ongeziwe Hlakula I like curries. What is a Gupta curry though? @JS Bach Hopefully nothing to ensure she does not die from laughter........hahahahaha Glamouratise????? what is that word meaning Hlaudi?
