Gripson Teffu,aaaah
Sandile Khowane,@Thapelo Motabogi are you sure they're talking about Tito Mboweni? @Jean-Pierre Le Roux Fake News "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux Share your imaginary research with us "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux you are imagining things "@Norman Rongee Africa is not a country but a continent "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux All Trade Agreements and Sovereign Loan agreements are classified together with Full Cabinet Minutes "How much does Tegeta owe us? it appears they supplied every coal order to Eskom the issue here really is how the tender was awarded "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux it is you who said you have access to South African classified Trade and Loan Agreements "@Dmitry Nikashin you can tell she prepares her arguments @Albert Noah she's very prepared. @Felix Muyoba the Entire Board and EXCO doesn't what this chap is talking about 😂 "@Sofia Sofia the Commission only to explain the process of coal operations "@makhosi nobhatyi Fake News "@makhosi nobhatyi but why are you lying Mashing is a Eskom's primary energy acting General Manager "@makhosi nobhatyi Eskom sold some of it mines "@makhosi nobhatyi oh Ok
Glenn Llewellyn,@Thapelo Motabogi Well done on that beautiful bible verse. Hopefully we can make things better. John 8:32 buddy does wonders. @Jean-Pierre Le Roux Yep. Big time. Ooh crap - she just dropped a truth bomb. Great speech.
Nelson Musoliwa,Does false and lie mean the same thing before one just jump into some anxiety Are some who get sense that load shedding should never have happened if relevant managers constantly operated within Energy wheel diagram. Planning in advance Is it not a propaganda for people to play lotto en mass for those who are in such business to get more rich i doubt if there is such a winne Coal of poor quality results in a chain of multiple burdens on Eskom like ash handling and plants maintenance frequent etc Which human skin color do SAns admire the most Some members of Eskom board and exc behaved like coal from gupta mines during combustion process of the coals!!!!!!!
sikhumbuzo crispen sibanda,no its not Chairman Jabu Mabuza but the statement released by Ben Ngubane @Bridgette Kekana pli add minister Brown to the group
Jean-Pierre Le Roux,China will take over Eskom completely in June when SA defaults on the 33bill loan....lol "@Sandile Khowane  "@Sandile Khowane  "@Sandile Khowane  "A bunch of idiots were trying to run Eskom. They failed and stole. Fire the idiots and hire ppl on merit  "@Sandile Khowane  JZ and Julias is also here commenting with fake profiles
makhosi nobhatyi,Ben Ngubane was a liar in statement he made Jabu Mabuza did say that is was corruption and cheating Testimony is clear They were chasing all whites because they would exposed them giving tegeta contract an lawful but pressure from former president was hot Tegeta owe us billions Koko will be arrested by next week I want all this miracles pastors to account too "Judge read all this evidence and take note of each file putting bullet point  He is scared @felix muyoba doesn’t matter whether he understand or not what is important he is upright person. Those engineers cheat the system for that matter dr Ben Ngubane was failed at SABC and shifted to Eskm @ felix muyoba he understand coz his company was giving Eskom coal. "@sandile khowane he is a chairman of the board What happened to Eskom owne mine? They buy Gupta mine @sandile khowane no I was not lying I was talking about ubaba uJM that as chairman knows about these processes being demonstrated here "@felix khowane I am interested to hear how Eskom sold its mines lot of shenanigans happened there that when Gupta chip in Please DA and Eff this is not something to gain politics Zuma still maintains that there is no state capture!! Do you believe himself or is it correct when he says that? "ANC is not corrupt only individuals as you heared testimony by Mabuza yesterday so now ANC is going to act later stage after this commission I promise you "Let me break down little bit  "I still maintain Mbeki goes out building himself Nkandla dodging system to enrich himself "Why DA take out msimang and lying to us that they make him as premier candidates where he signs wrong contract "Say whatever you want to say I won’t bother myself answering that fact remains we all talk because of ANC stood up for our rights "Ramaphosa was facing to be fired with Gordhan by President then but media publish that b4 it happened. Former president paused for a while "Ramaphosa is working hard to rectify those mistakes which Anc didn’t look proper so that show how remorseful you are I am saying those whom acted wrong and found guilty must be sentenced finish I am Anc member "I am working harder than you know my president say Thuma mina I raise my hand "ANC manifesto speaks to the point "Remember Gordhan when he says those people who are implicated are not just sitting down

"@Thando Nkutha Yes @Desmond Masilela Bad coal that wasn't up to the standard needed by the power stations @rohan barnard Lyn Brown appeared last year "@Thando Nkutha Yes "@Michael Michael Non-payment is a problem @Nelson Musoliwa 😀 "@Michael Michael In my area

sam mandebvu,"@Jean-Pierre Le Roux
Chris Welensky,@Jean-Pierre Le Roux That applies to the whole government! It was stated in the budget speech that SA government borrows R1.4bn every DAY to keep going. Think Escom is bad? We borrow in two days the total amount paid to the Guptas. @Briony French hehehehe
Viktombi,Until when are we going to sit and listen to this kind of corruption Koko should have been arrested long back I wonder what they are waiting for Mashego?
welton paulse,"Clearly eskom like many other SOE's dont believe in employing experts in key positions. They might as well have gone and employed robots

"@Myka'Al Daud ""Believe""" @rohan barnard hi friend... we getting schooled on coal no not really @rohan barnard its only been this guy and all he spoke about was coal Acting Senior General Manager – Primary Energy Division at Eskom. this is just an overview on how Eskom operates in terms of coal operations. science? @rohan barnard I think I failed this class today .... @rohan barnard I may actually believe you lol lol lol "The energy in coal comes from energy that was stored in giant plants that lived hundreds of millions of years ago in swamp forests "When these giant plants and ferns died "Most of the coal we use now was formed about 300 million years ago "As plants and trees died @rohan barnard i learnt more from this "Plants and other life forms "Coal was formed due to the compression of the peat at high temperature and pressure. As coal was formed from the remains of vegetation @Andre Gerber LOL even me @Andre' Van Zyl LOL even me "The biggest reserves are in the USA This means that there is enough coal to last us around 150 years at current rates of production. "Coal is a non-renewable fossil fuel that is combusted and used to generate electricity Because coal takes millions of yrs to develop and there is a limited amount of it @rohan barnard ..... lol ❤ "83 % of the total amount of coal produced in South Africa is mined in Mpumalanga. Coal is also mined in the provinces of Limpopo "State and is concentrated around the towns of Lephalale @Jack Sparrow awwwww 😃 lol "The five largest coal mining companies account for around 85% of all production. They are Anglo American plc South Africa is one of the seven largest coal-producing and one of the top five coal-exporting countries in the world. "More than a quarter of coal mined in South Africa is exported "look what I found ..... @rohan barnard South Africa's coal reserves are estimated at 53 billion tonnes 200 years ? how many year did we live already ???
Flomenthia Ngcobo,@Desmond Masilela YES! Did he say this was his first job? seeing that his been there for 25 going to 26 years now

Bafana Zondo,Clowns as always
Tsepang R,@Risuna you seem to be very well informed. Where do you get your intel from if I may ask?
Briony French,Google it never happens its best to just delete the politics blind people from the chat so we can stop being bumped everytime they move the political elements of the country want to divide and conquer the people and we all falling for it like fools. we should actually all not vote. gove the current government the middle finger. we should stand together saying hamba we are not voting until all these dodgey crooks are in jail. then once we know who is clean we can make a fair choice nope i love geology that wont happen the ceasing the voting i know too many bigwigs caught up in the problem... like vbs like everything else... then dont watch this. for decisions to be made the whole picture needs to be provided as in all cases state capture is everywhere. so to understand the how bad it is you need the education philip stop with your party bashing philip has been captured by an 👾 and philip is now the invisible man blocked. yayness
