I think if this country were to progress the black demography of this country which is by far the majority has to punish the ANC and show them that ANC is below and exist within the laws of SA. iF NOT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SA AND A BANANA REPUBLIC OR AS TRUMP WOULD SAY A SHTHOLE COUNTRY.

Precedent Ntanzi,Graeme Armstong? LOL I gues the R is silent on yr surname
Mash Pot,Let's make comments about the Commission Orefile...I suppose he will not testify today and I don't think anyone will testify today...on whether this inquiry is necessary? yes it is "However "However "Our judiciary by far is the most effective and independant of the three arms of the state. Nevertheless One of the Constitutional principles is to restrain state power. This is because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts completely. People seem to not understand the importance of the Constitution "I am interest in what happened atSAA "It is the discretion of the Commission to recommend prosecution "@Orefile...that is the unfortunate truth. The government is in shambles right now Putting people behind bars should not be where this commission ends. Further policies and laws have to be changed. In my honest opinion I hope the commission recommends the re-establishment... Re-establishment of the scorpions...they had a 98% success rate in prosecutions
Philani ngcobo,Fils de l'homme you are provoking us.
Jessican Naidoo,Dont get caught up by the trolls. They are distracting you and creating more hate. Waiting for the movie on this whole thing. It will be epic
Orefile Macheoane,Will the former President Testify? "Apparently they would only be sending him a letter today to request him to testify. Im just perplexed This will certainly be a long exercise. The wheels of justice turn slowly grind* True. I am looking forward to the roll out of the enquiry. "@Philo Without the constitution we are a ship without a sail. I believe thee constitution should be mandatory focus in schools. Not to be flipped through "@Dominic... State-guarantees perplex me. Its an idea that tax payers have willingly bailed out SOE's. I mean the recklessness of our officers will always be ""guaranteed"" by the taxpayer" Scorpions was independent. Thats all we need. The state tries to own every independent entity that challenges it. Im not sure if the country will ever move forward with the attitude we have towards each other. Very mature How much time do they need I just wonder who planned the commission. #Why were the notices delayed?
Siyamthanda Dondolo,There is no such a thing as a white African. "No "When you tick those forms "You are either black or white This commission is just a waste of time and resources.

peter pott,the commission must watch that it doesn't turn into another news channel. I am worried so far it only names one family I am disappointed the DA was denied provision to cross examine the witnesses "share the wealth of the country equally Those accused are going to move freely out of this commissiony. Kemp and Helens SC are in the audience. "ladies and gentlemen "the next president will also exercise his/her power and bring Marikana commission This slide reflects as if the vice president post is useless .Where was he I Where was CR in the last 10 years "Field "Zondo "It's Fils here is something we are not asking ourselves. how much is this commission costing us. is there no court cases already rolling in place? "ignore Fils guys "journalists are happy This commission runs the danger of only tickling our ears. scratch the surface ladies and gentlemen. take a look at which corporates accompanied President Zuma on his Brics trips. take a look and you will shocked jonas is gonna come and tell us he was offered 600m. He refused. and now he goes and works for Mtn that were fined for not registering their SIM cards in Nigeria. hmm mtn rocked by Iran license bribery scandal wait and see. the judge will decline cross examination Helens SC is JZ advocate Helens will cast doubts on this commission. by highlighting weakness "Thando "naicker He knows cross examination is not going to be allowed. "What is twenty years mzala! who confirmed? cezula. He already submitted an affidavit "Law students "cezula "in law lawyers make money out of this. They will request those documents in a letter Zuma is out in the cold. lawyers are knocking on his door to represent him thus making money lusenga SC next time write notes and read from it cross examination will not be allowed "the DA applied There we go. that how I read the rules of this commission No cross examination is allowed "how do you apply to cross examine. hmm.the witnesses talk today and only after few days lol!!!!!!!!!!
9Play9Boy9,Wish we could have a just and fair society. Which we could hold those who continually vote the ANC accountable for all the corruption. We the people keep voting for this theft and corruption. ANC thing. Our own fault. We keep voting them into power when they have done nothing but break down what little was left of the apartheid catastrophe. very simple solution to all of this. One our people refuse to implement : Vote SOMEONE ELS happy to degrade each other every oppertunity and happy to watch the powerful fill their own stomachs. happy to be poor and racist and ignorant. happy to Cota myANC! happy to break down moral fabric. take the land. it's fine. you cannot escape the fact that to live with western advantages such as technology - you have to operate like a western civilization. you can't ignore western values and expect western benifits "reported hate speach :"" kill the boer""" reported for hate speach. my channel We will look back and blame ourselves. We kept voting these incompetent thugs. "all I see here is a severe ignorance to how government It would take 9 generations for a poor South African to lift himself out of poverty if he started in 2018 the damage our people have allowed by keeping ANC in power will take 100ds of years to fix. and we haven't even started yet. WE MUST UNSEAT THIS GOVERNMENT I think our people have been left with a dependency culture - enforced by the apartheid regime. Our people are not taught to help themselves. to grow and to build we have a lazy culture of handouts. our industries are flooded with people who believe they are owed something rather than people willing to work and build. The ANC has spent enough money on land redistribution to buy ALL agricultural land 4 times over. But are happy to deceive our people into thinking it's their constitution that's preventing it...
