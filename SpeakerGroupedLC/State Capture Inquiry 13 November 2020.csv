Paula Cooke,morning all who is on the hot seat please🤭
ZuenTheMan,"@Paula Cooke Hi @ALTA Hi again. 🙂 @ALTA Haha we clearly have the same interests. @Aubrey De Bliquy Probably the best comment I have read. 👍
Aubrey De Bliquy,It is clear the ANC government is incompetent and the EFF is worse before we start the false group white guilt argument. 3 million immigrants need at least 2500 new schools. Did we build them? NO "If we have no borders hI @ALTA sORRY MY ETHERNET WAS UNPLUGGED "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee EFF minus the falacious group white guilt trip which is sort of off putting because try as much as I can I may vote ANC for the first time if there is an attempt to fix what is broken. We will have to fast track effective on line home or remote schooling to bring the best teachers and language use to bear on our challenge to rise. ANd then unfortunately a lot of horrible ideas and nasty race exploitation for votes which makes us all victims. Especially because we are making enemies out of potential friens and allies. We cannot do this in enmity. Lets stop fooling ourselves. @ALTA tha is why we must never rush to judge We cannot ignore the possibility of a witch hunt. Abuse of executive power for partisan political agendae will alwyas be here no matter who governs. Nuance is everything. If you can't make things better at least don't make them worse. This is why executive and judiciary cannot be cadre deployment zones without destroying the state. That is what happens when the judiciary become a cadre deployment zone like the executive. Law cannot be selective but it must not be abused for partisan withc hunts. Sometimes our law rightly gives the guilty immunity if the case against them was procured illegally thwarting the accused rights. THere was legitimate BEE in the middle of this. Nuance is everything. "@Kerry van Schalkwyk Zondo clearly loves his country @Tommygun Yes We dont gain foreign friends if their friendship comes at the price of our SOEs The UN blacklisting or rumours of blacklisting Denel could only have been deeply political at international level. Nuance is everything. We are like lost children in this infinite enchanted does. We seldom have more than a mirage of reality. India is such a deep and ancient land like Africa. I can only imagine our collective best interests will be best served without corruption which has neither race nor gender nor political affilliation. "This he hired a white lawyer mme is a ss stupid as the WMC meme. Its an evil lie. a gem in the crown of Bernays The devil dances in delight when fools believe BS @Kerry van Schalkwyk For me it all vanishes into a blurry shadow as I like neither to judge what I do not know nor condone evil. I always try to understand nuance. There always is. also with its own nuance. Red tapes. Is that like red herrings? |o? \o/ "@Kerry van Schalkwyk That should be high farce. 😂 you said ""JZ will play the Dudu Myeni card - I am pleading the 5th. He will never be interrogated get the biltong and the red wine. I was just imagining these bullys trying to stop a boat from sinking. LOL Sinking it was inevitable blending politis with corporate profit agenda. Mutual anihilation. LOL The politicians did not want to bail out the cow they miked dry. @Rita The scientists are still here. That is the real wealth. We can do what we wish as a country if we hoose coherence. It's a choice. Politicians cannot control what they cant create and its dangerous Malema is a smart cookie. He is placing himself between the voters and the ANC and challenging them to deliver. All is fair in love and war. Hmm that reflects some arrogance. He must be scared. A lawyer who does not know what to confirm or deny. He feels cornered. How can politicians manage what they cannot create? Duh! Zondo is smart and sharp. @zip reeper Who is a skollie? Didnt follow your nuance or lack thereof? Why do I have this sense of having been here before? As if I am not hearing this for the first time? People fearmongering about #COVERT19 are getting boring. Go check the numbers and get a life. Numbers don't lie. people do. And they cannot even make a president of a decent hindu American lady of impeccable integrity like congresswoman Major Tulsi Gabbard form Hawaii. Politicians cannot manage what they cannot create politics and business are like matter and anti-matter which anihilate one another when they meet. @Colleen Arezio I presume he is explaining to the witness the purpose f the law. The use of hypothetical is illustrative.

Moonchild,"When these implicated individuals start rambling on & on @dominic mabe - he is politically connected. That's all you need in this country. Law abiding! Joke of the day!! I wish the Adv would interrupt him & tell him he will be lead on all this evidence! It is ridiculous that he is allowed to ramble on & on like this "BS baffles brains.

Altus Lombard,This is going to be a long day. Dan Mantsha was scrapped from the attorneys role because he got caught with his hands in the till. 'Brief address'! That was the first lie already. It was a recurring theme under Zuma. All key positions were replaced with idiots. "The BEE partner for BAE LSSA was a Mbeki company. This is why R855m was paid for a worthless company
Zweli Mkosana,I wonder whon what is this guy saying @ Keith actually it's not those people had to be bussed from other provinces. the majority of people of south africa are tired of these corrupt politicians. who takes Tony Yengeni serious? "remember this is how zuma started "jenny please our people know where they grants are coming from. they voted anc because it could be it's doing a great job in their municipality ace pa is now a state witness shame on you Tony Yengeni @ yolo he is so emotional about this ace saga to point where you see he could even assault the journalist.
Brian,Are we going to hear any questions today? "If they were a responsible board that took decisions for the benefit of the country Kennedy is going to interrupt him shortly and ask him to repeat the question - Ala Kate Did I just hear Z speak? @ Jaqueline. It was very brief. If you blinked you'd have missed it. Is he actually answering a question? @ Kerry. I think he started off with an opening statement and just continued into his closing statement Denel built ships? @ Thando. It's almost time for Zondo's tea break. we all look forward to the break Even the Guptas meant well. They took great care of their money bags @ Regina. Hy kan dit bekostig He means as a Zuma advisor? "@ Regina. Beslis ... en met n ""sakkie"" weggestap?" All this without reading from notes. Quite remarkable Oh ppleaase DONT'T And some will pitch on Monday but say nothing? Adv Kennedy is never going to get going. He may as well go for a long lunch Rather than waste time??

Siva Williams,Kate Hofmyer is a far better person to question this man
Shubbz Romy,This guy is part of the crew who stole. Now this arrogance... Be prepared for orange overalls...
Goat -,Hello guys. Yeah they already want Ramaphosa to resign . Lol hi @Naledi Barron... Ace Magushele has been granted R200 000 bail... Cyril Ramaphosa won't serve his second term....I can tell you that much. @Naledi Barron yeah someone was gracious enough to help me with my rent. Jacob Zuma's wife is in Ace camp.. "@Naledi Barron. ... If it wasn't for indian racists at Discovery that I worked with while I was there @Mfundo isn't Ace Magushele camp going to petition for the removal of Cyril Ramaphosa as a president? @Mfundo but they make up a story. .you know politics is a dirty game. @Mfundo I was working at discovery in the legal and compliance department. I was the most qualified but the least paid and this made them somewhat paranoid and they concocted charges against me . @Mfundo okay I thought Ramaphosa had no support. I always warn people that they should be careful when they apply for a job at Discovery. I was mistreated by Indian people and there is no doubt that my skin color has something to do with it. @Nemabubuni Geoffrey - Okay I see bro. So ACE stands no chance. @Mfundo yes you can say that. And the thing is I never looked at Indians and saw racists before the discovery incident. I thought they were our brothers. But now I see what EFF meant about Indians. @Louis C - Even the HR department was against me. And HR department was represented by an Indian woman named Reshika or something like that. She was biased and was intent on destroying my career. @Naledi Barron - So you can help me with connections? @Megan Diedericks - Yeah I think what is making me see it as a race thing is all people involved were Indians and pretty much around the same time EFF was going around saying Indians are very racist @Mfundo - You got connections? @Eddie Reddy - where is the company? My awful experience with Indians at Discovery has significantly affected my relationship with them to be honest. It will take long to recover from it. @Louis C - And what is worse is I only worked there for a month and the second month I was facing this nightmare. Thanks for support . The way Discovery handled the matter was honestly atrocious. @Eddie Reddy - What kind of company is it? "@Nemabubuni Geoffrey - But what kind of monster take away your rent "BRB later guys and thanks for the support. Although my situations still remains terrible
Miles High Club,ANC = Thugs. ACE granted bail & wasn't arrested? Zondo pack your bags. ANC has fallen. He wasn't even arrested so not sure how he could have gotten bail Acted being the operative word I wanna hear live stream of ACE addressing bloemfontein public "I'm not police DUDU ACE Dissolve all political parties. Use the funds to pay salaries of workers who actually work in exchange for their salary. It seems as though anyone who sits in those chairs are immune to the law level 5 lock down in bloem after today 😂 ACE don't want public roaming the streets to assassinate him and those who protect him. This guy is a crook

But his supporters would cry and do night vigils lol @Sal SA these pastors are scams. Denel owed a lot. How come when they pride themselves with their work? "@Xolani J Masemula i think its best if it goes back to the state "What is Denel actually? i missed their appearances "@Naledi Barron Wow
