"@Maritime Studies I agree @Ewald Kruger something was happening in the background we are not aware of "They are really trying to avoid being in favour of one company that pays bribes "I always tell my children Are there any leaders with integrity in this country?????????? BEE has stripped people of integrity @Wolfgang Redeker seems so @ALTA so difficult @Wolfgang Redeker that is why international corporations will not invest in this country because they know BEE will cost them money "Who in your right mind agrees with the way the BEE is running its course @ALTA I am GATVOL @Power Electronics EXACTLY @Anwar Syed yes!!!! "@lufuno shumani muloiwa they should do away with BEE "@Thxpelo M they should stop it until the policy is revised to not be able to use it to for looting purposes @Thxpelo M the destruction caused to our country by this policy should surely be clear it is not working lol @kyle curtis ja nee "@Power Electronics and what they do not get "Hi all I am back "have I missed anything exciting "@Vuyisa Msomi Aaaahhh maybe I should rewind LOL @ALTA @ALTA I am rewinding.... "Oh my word her lawyer also still guiding her Her lawyer teaching Kate how to do her job.............REALLY? Would it be possible that this lady lied on her CV? Is @Gordon Nefdt a troll in disguise? @ALTA thought as much @Sindile Moni precisely and nobody seems to get it @Mzalwane Mzala to be honest very questionable qualifications @Mzalwane Mzala but it has also come to light that many people have supplied falsified credentials @Maritime Studies revisiting strategies is the best suggestion!!!!! @ALTA hahahaha I am at the car place now @Maritime Studies the problem is there is such a divide and confusion who to vote for @ALTA hahahahhaa @Bongane Lephatsoa at it again..........ai ai she is going to be struck of her CA and Audit credentials all company records involving financial transactions have to be kept for the last 5 years. CA's know that "@naledi brown yes SAICA MUST remove her also a delinquent director "if ANC wants to be seen to be doing the right thing @Bheki Terri's who would be best to do that? individuals or political parties? @akonamandla I hope they do long stories again people need land and you want it hahahaha @bheki Terri's this lady who is transacting as a CA "we cant blame apartheid anymore this person stole money to buy more property than she needs this is better than rugby on a Saturday it would be an illegal contract "her lawyer put her at risk by letting her enter into an invalid contract she has just thrown her lawyer under the bus delinquent lawyer coming up "this one is FINISHED and she knows it wyn in that blue water bottle @ Nature 🤣🤣🤣 wyn vir die pyn heya @blake yes but.... no but....you see @Valencia she let her enter into an invalid contract agreement so glad the Chair raised her CA abilities this one just goes to prove that a degree does not mean you have the apt skills or expertise or experience how many of the leaders are putting shame to their degrees profession why even put an address down from years ago I'll use my address from my childhood in future if a CA can do that so can I what happened to proof of address??? she is a FRAUD SHE COMMITTED FRAUD @Gordon Dallas I know oh my gawd this one is unbelievable "that address she have is like identity theft @Mandy Wainwright it sure looks like it @carmen James the sheriff will arrive at the previous home and attach all the assets of the new owner hahahaha @Elton hahahaha lol @Stix @Ewald.....ja our new leaders are looters "@Ewald it is the mentality of look out for today another mistake @heather Durr and then Trump will take it to court "@Riaan Venter me too I am furious they will all lose their jobs if these entities have to close because they are bankrupt because of looting @Riaan Venter in the same boat after having worked so hard to build up and invested so much....hulle het dit net so opge%$# nee fffrik my head is about to explode "I would accept if everything I have lost as a result of being a white woman and it went to the masses it would have been a little bit more acceptable @tommygun exactly "oh my gawd "SAA was an asset as was ESKOM

Pastor J.J,Lets hope that our 2 Nyaope Queens Kwinana and Mbanjwa have not been arrested for shoplifting and make an appearance here today. @Person of interest They are all out on the streets making sure those 2 naughty girls make an appearance before us the Jury #Khanyi Age.gracefully @Yolo More Do you see me? "@Yolo More I see you darling @Valencia J Get the vetkoeks out. @ALTA More Liefie @Khanyi Age.gracefully Greetings Darling @Person of interest Do you see my messages to you my friend? @Jenny Whitewaves Greetings my friend @Cruda Bex Sawubona Mfuwethu Where is Kwinana's Parrot a.k.a Banjo @Norman Zwane Maybe I shouldnt have asked. hahahaha @wim louw Morning my much loved brother. You think she is still shoplifting or already with security? @Elvis Malakoane Greetings my brother @wim louw The Mall is within walking distance from me. Will be back in 10 minutes. Should I take pics? @ALTA Jan jy my sien? Kan @wim louw I am stressed bro. That Nyaope queen has been shoplifting recently. @Elvis Malakoane You see me Counsel? Oh nooooooooooooooooooo This one does not use Google. She got answers from the Chappies wrappers when she ran SAAT. @Valencia J I am sending them a Sec 3.3 notice right now @Valencia J What about the makers of Chappies? bcos she got answers there too. @wim louw This beauty used info from the wrappers and ran SAAT. I imagine how much more could be done with Google Oh Nooooooooooooo The fix has worn out. Break pleeeeez @Thabo Ntsoko Why and what for? @Sanjay Maharaj Thanks for that correction. and here i was thinking you was in a bad mood this morning. hahahahaha @ALTA I greeted @Annie Van Niekerk 3 times...@Anne M. 2 times and @Khanyi Age.gracefully 3 times. I thought they were in a bad mood and was ignoring me. hehehehehe @Anne M. I see you precious one Oh Nooooooooooo not again @wim louw Not that scoundrel. Grade 2 @20% @Rob Nel Yes she is a CAt this one @Person of interest I have a Team on standby at the North Pole to fetch this fooooool "Kate @Salmaan Abrahams Greeting Bro @Person of interest Anything and everything on the internet maintains a lifetime DNA Who made a noise and woke the Nyaope Queen? Please chat softly now on You are always blunt Mnabjo I am now going to have Lunch for 30 minutes. Please do not type anything that has an EFF in it. Will let you know when I am done. hehehehe This Kwinana and Mbanjwa are going to be disowned by their children again today. Mbanjwa is in the deep deep very deep sewer for this contract. Clearly a contract of convenience to facilitate movement/laundering of funds. @Anne M. Absolutely. But the implication on Mbanjwa arising out of Kwinana and Memela is scary No need to stress if she is a CA or Mbanjwa is a Lawyer. Where they are going to next week does not need Degrees. @Valencia J @Elvis Malakoane Give us names so we can also be rid of the pests Mbanjwa is GONE. She ran away. I will find that one by the robot and bring her back OK i caught that Mbanjwa. She is back tied to that chair. She needs a nappy change though. @Rozza A Yes I did. I can confirm that she is a CAt. A crooked one @Thami Mhlomi No. Thats residential address. Domicilium Citandi et executandi is an address to receive legalprocesses @Naledi Barron The next President is going to be brilliant. The best 404 I bet the last R50 i have in my wallet that Kwinana's daughter is on the chat. With a very damp pair of pants. BFF similar to EFF Judge Judy is an amateur compared to our Katie @Tshiyamo Austine That would be illegal then. She must agree to be recorded @Lesley Gove I am naming mine Banjo. It just doesnt shut up.

Jenny Whitewaves,Greetings everyone But Air France sounds as if it should not have BEE Reason no 1 there are very severe penalties in France for bribery she could do something really unusual and give the truth She learnt from yesterday soon we will heard not to incriminate myself client conference going on in the ladies restroom Has anyone suggested she is charged for trading for others than herself without a license I don't think she did trade or if she did it was for herself but if that is her evidence on oath she needs to be charged to get the truth As I understand the rules there are no limits on the amount traded but the money has to be yours basically you can't make financial decisions for anyone else without a license At least it is abetter cover than mum selling land and giving you the money @Anne M. she is either guilty of trading without a licence or not trading and it was a bribe Kate prepare your assistants she will want every single piece of paper The statements would have been needed for tax IF she was going to pay tax THe ink is still wet on it from 1 day ago Her Lawyer is checking that she has been paid in advance If she did trade the money will there be records on the financial markets She had to buy and sell through somewhere Hope they will check the audits of all those companies If you take 1 bribe you will take many bribes I wonder if anyone checked these two companies really existed That face would sour the milk "like writing a statement on a police form with the date 5 years ahead The address is in English maybe that;s the problem

SD Gudunkomo,morning everybody Sjay. and I see chair is calm today Hofmeyer is trying by all means to corner the witness to accept what she is putting into her even if it's incorrect according to the witness Jenny we learn everyday ne?☺ Neo.true Have you notice though that the commission is fighting for the rejection of white own companies that didn't get business with SOEs it seems the commission is trying to fight for white owned businesses that were rejected. it seems this commission was established to fight for white owns businesses that lost business with SOE due to noncompliance to BEE Wim Louw yes.have you heard any of the black businesses that are queried about not getting business in this commission? Why fighting for Air France? so Air France was the middle man Maxwell I noticed that Hofmeyer doesn't like the sound of that😂 True @Maxwell.and her point fall away when Kwinana stood her ground is Kwinana related to Mkhwebane? they look the same🤔 Thxpelo name one politician who is not a criminal all politicians are criminals Carmen what had c what bad decisions did she make? Carmen please remind me Kwinana is standing by her evidence Yes @Maxwell Mbanjwa is correct. it seems Hofmeyer believed the evidence given to her over the witnesses answer 😂😂😂😂Kwinana! school her Ms Kwinana🤣 😂😂😂😂 school her 😂😂😂 😂😂😂 Kwinana is very confident today Calculator and the accountant is like a bible and the pastor😊 "Masego Kwinana has to give to correct numbers remember she is answering Dan numbers were already put on the table.she was to confirm them atleast she is answering the questions. so it's possible that Dudu is Mrs Myeni not Miss Myeni all we know is that Mrs is for married women and Miss for single ladies.unless it changed in 1994 😁 which is possible. Jones uyaphapha Thami Dudu wasn't answering the questions Zama u are also isela by being black You are also isela I disagree with chair.I am also still putting address that I no longer live in. when filling forms Anne because I got used to it when filling forms except when doing online purchases Akhonamandla how come you be the first to throw insult to your black sister.🤔 XSN ukhala ngani @XNS Hofmeyer job is to find wrong doing where it's not.trying hard to convince the world that there is fraud where there isn't thetha mama EliasMnisi that one XSN is asleep I think we need #CR statements to see if what they say is a problem 😊 Sango you must be insane BEE is not a mistake. she's tired now lol nothing to be excited about😅 sorry guys for getting excited over nothing😂 Simphiwe Mathunjwa.she is disappointed🤣🤣🤣🤣 Lungisani Nkosi she witted in a second so Kate was excited cos the evidence was leading to Zuma.but in a second everything just varnished😂 Sango she's late 😂😂😂😂🤣 @Lungisani She was @Sango. 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣Kwinana trying to spark conflict between the two ladies EDITED😂😂😂😂😂😂 recordings would made it oh no she's lying😂😂😂😂 yoh she said it😂😂😂 Yeah she throw her under the bus Yoh she lied about Dudu.

Dan Brown,I wonder if DUDU phoned her last night and gave her some tips? or maybe a few threats to make sure she doesn't implicate the unimplicatable Dud woman. Agreed DCJ is way too tolerant with the DUD woman Dudu is already on her Cuban or Dubai flight At least Kwinani has no-one sitting under the desk coaching her like Dudu did. "A denial trumps a Dudu ""I plead the 5th"" defense in every breath. That too me just shouts I am so guilty I cant answer anything." She probably gets R2-R3K Minimum. Kermit the Frog represents Dudu Mbanjwa only worships the [̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ιοο̲̅)̲̅$̲̅] I remember when Chappies were half cent each "I remember the old days when ""Gay"" meant Happy ^ ""BEE"" was something in the garden.

Peet Venter,"DCJ and Hoffmeyer had better things to do on this Saturday morning. Don't waste their time and energy. The truth shall set you free Kwinana has a brilliant mind. I can't think out excuses this fast. Chartered Accountants should be painstakingly aware that contracts need consensual signatories when property is purchased. "@Salty Crack ""I do"" is indeed the longest ""scentence""."
ma baker,she is very sarcastic. I hope Air France will reply. gatvol is putting it mildly
Pheladi Lamola,There's absolutely no way she is a CA ka nnete. Aowa. I have the same understanding as Ms Hofmeyer. She's just acting dumb this one Are we going to hear from Ms Hendricks at all? Lungisani 🤦🏾‍♀️ Mbanjwa yena Khaya Sithole has files for days. The question is why didn't anyone notice what's recorded in the minutes? Does she really not mind looking like an idiot for all to see? "Even if they had a big tape recorder on the table during the interview "I'm starting to feel sorry for her now

Leon Mbangwa,There's everything wrong when evidence leaders act like prosecutors. Its wrong and very wrong. Either they confuse their role or its hidden agendas. There is a big difference in the formulation of a question that seeks clarity than a question that resolves to find you guilty Dude was a star. She confused the enemy. The enemy camp is in disarray @moloiwa we not interested in text book theories of questioning. Define the difference between an evidence leader and a prosecutor or a criminal case and an enquiry. You will understand my concern. Kwinana is phoning a friend Zondo must learn to accept criticism. Ceasefire Ceasefire please Hofmeyre I think its hight time she evoke her right to remain silent. She must ask for break call Dudu for the wording . Witness is loosing her voice
Matolengwe Makongwana,Behavior of Ms Myeni made me respect Ms Kwinana 4 the courage 2 answer 4 dcisions she made. That defines leadership 4 me. Dcisions wil always b subject 2 scrutiny. I'm still against corruption though Commission is helping us to unearth the wrongs that were concealed. I guess we need to listen and be informed without slurs

Kevin Simon,Power Electronics. Have you just disproved the first law of thermodynamics. You should be in line for the Nobel Prize in Science. Hopefully the world will sit up and take notice. Dudu had every opportunity to refute and rebut the evidence. She chose not to because she couldn't.
Thabo Ntsoko,so we here 🤔 on a Saturday Kate should be investigated 😤 she's Robot not human incase i incriminate myself🤣 they can't be trusted 🤣🤣🤣 there comes examples she's playing dump no more water water for Mrs Kwinana terms and conditions 🤣🤣 "after the break she's not on the stand today?😱 yhoo 😱 mbanjwa

Anne M.,Hello @ALTA Morning @Annie Van Niekerk At last. @ALTA 😀😘 @Pastor J.J Can you see me now? Hi @Liza Jansen Hello B @SanFran Arnold Antique cars can often appreciate in value. Modern cars depreciate if it's bought through legal channels. Yup @Mzalwane Mzala MS is the female equivalent of Mr "@Kgothatso Manale Traditionally Miss is for unmarried women "Widow is also Mrs @Kgothatso Manale . Yes You're welcome @Kgothatso Manale . I have learnt quite a few things on this chat 😀 Same statement as Dudu's yesterday. The collective made the decisions. "@Jenny Whitewaves Myquestion is Ah @Naledi Barron you made it. "Yes "I don't know too much about forex trading "@Dero Dhawraj That's what I was thinking on Tuesday @Person of interest 😂 @Lungisani Nkosi All witnesses are allowed an interpreter if they feel more comfortable to speak in their mother tongue. All she had to do was ask for one. "@Mike Clark I heard that "Yes @Jenny Whitewaves Another possible rule broken? I'm sure SARS are keeping an eye on the commission. @Gordon Nefdt 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 "No @Ryan b No a different Kolisi Are they perhaps cutting in on another Saturday programme to stream the commission? The commission doesn't normally sit on a Saturday. @Tommygun 😂 Probably @Tommygun Close on 4000 people a little earlier. Hi @Rene Ngwenya It's going to be interesting 😉 I also thought I heard her say she now has copies of the January statements @Mike Clark @Rene Ngwenya That's just sad. A successful person falling for the quick money. "Yup and which is why Kate kept insisting on an electronic copy and Kwinina knows that 13:50 @candice fredericks Some have already testified @Fi fi plus Dr Dahwa (spelling?) @Bheki Terris Myeni had a lot of influence and connections. She could have moved Dhawa to another SOE without having to destroy his life. @Naledi Barron Are you seeing any of my comments? I greeted you earlier. :virtualhug: @Naledi Barron "Yes Isn't that the reason why she's under investigation? @Pastor J.J @Keamogetswe Sennelo Where is your evidence to make such a dangerous statement? Mbanjwa drew up the contracts for Kwinana and Memela @Valencia J "Me too @Tommygun . Is somebody on the ir cell phone near a mic? That sometimes causes ""static""" Sorry @Mac Mandla We've heard too much information to believe Ms Kwinana is innocent. @Mhlali The Citizen The so called buying & selling properties was to cover the movement of kickback money. The money was part of a tender at SAA that was illegally given to somebody. Myeni & Kwinana singing from the same hymn book. Myeni also held herself up as a role model to others. "@Riaan Venter No "Agree @Lugisani Mufamadi Also Adv Sekela "@Tshedza Munyai Having heard the evidence given by Ms Memela Why would you do that @Sabelo Nxumalo ? Why not your current address? Mbanjwa @Boitumelo Phenya drew up the contract @Pheladi Lamola You're right. Minutes are supposed to accurately represent what was said and they are generally sent out a day or two after a meeting while the info is still fresh in people's minds. "Ah "Shame "@Thulani Faku We don't know if Kate understands isiXhosa or not. If a witness wants to talk in their mother tongue Acting @Nick Moshia @SABC News Adv Hofmeyr's mic is coming through with an echo and breaking up. Please check. "Yes 😂 @Tom Hi @Just Tami @Justice Maluleke Gu @Rendani Netshiheni There are incompetent people of all ages and race groups. Let us concentrate on the actions and behaviour of the person. @Teekay Mntungwa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 She went to save her own skin @Russia Magezi @Sibulele Mbambi The commission does have interpreters - for anybody who asks to speak in their mother tongue. @fuzile dazana Probably. Dudu has a lot of power. @Angelo Doubel I second that 👏
Tommygun,Has she inciminated herself yet? answer the question 🙂 thats why we not talking about cars... this is WHY it is an extroidinary deal.... reoaired in 1 day? repaired in 1 day the GPUs? do we care if shes married or not. does it matter? @Gugulethu Xhosans press f5 or refresh. My sound is fine Morning @ALTA late start 🙂 "@ALTA Dont look thigh slappingly fun yet Everybody packing up around Mbabjwa and going home as she re-examines Kwinana. "Errrr @Ndivhuho Maxwell it was a long 3 Dudu days... @weaverbird b limited political skills and laughable business skills. @Zachra Petersen Coz all payments for employees would come from the public purse which is currently empty...mostly... You were Dudu and Zumas sock puppet muppet. "@Jenny Whitewaves oh  No clue about conflict of interests @Antoinette Meyer They do indeed and that lands squarely at the door of the ANC YOU need to produce them! "Ack shame WHERE ARE THEY? BIG Omission 🙂 look now... No she lied and this is evedence proving she lied... Why they need to see the doc if Kwinana wasnt there? THis is new this SABC mid trial talk thru Schtik @Anne M. think they may have woken to the fact there are more watching this than their regular programming @Boitumelo Phenya Same reason Kwinana didnt provide finacials...oversight....? @ALTA Avo toast for me. "@Annie Van Niekerk @ALTA Me too order a take out.... @Yusriy There were no investors just enablers of bribes You know no one will listen to your reexamination Mbanjwa NIce buying land and evicting the locals 🙂 Capatalist imprerialist dogs I guess the authority is not so much as an issue as the buyer is liable for issues in the contract (re authority) seller wont loose as agreement will be illegal. @Heather Durr It could be worse.... @Keamogetswe Sennelo Shes an agent of truth fighting the forcess of darkness and corruption! No one is trying to frame anyone or make up evedence. Its all staring us in the face. Is anyone else getting annoying (minorish) audio clicks? Im listening on headphones. "Cool re noise  @Deon Kotze she hasnt used it like Dudu...yet... @Pholoso Kale its fine to agree with her on some points but dont forger the mountain of other evidence "@Rene Ngwenya Nah @Thami Mhlomi You saying evedence against her is wrong or commission must just be nicer to her? @Johann I would say that most people at senior positions in SOEs are cadre deplyments and ANC members..? "@Johann The composition of SOE boards at transnet "@Johann sure..police @Johann Sure but we know she's compliant to other ANC exhortations @Johann not without googling 🙂 "@Johann Nope @Johann Not sure hpow long you been watching these proceedings and how long you been checking my comments but you are wrong and wrong about me. WHat supporting docs can you get for board minutes? "Really @Tshedza Munyai Bad eh 🙂 "@melds melds spot on @thembisa odendaal she was at least in 85 and 89 when she gor her honours. @Wesley Myburgh what? The no mindset mindset? "@Maritime Studies Go to the west and ask for a job @Dan Brown Tuck shop maybe... "@thembisa odendaal Sure @Mzalwane Mzala ITs coz we dont caremuch for education (all round the world) lip service is paid and ppl will talk about its importance..but you can see from teachers and their pay societyu dont care @Teboho David Motsamai Kate did it first day...its legit She has no understanding of conflict of interests. we going till we get to the end.... @SABC News think the stream may need a restart...stuttering pic and audio "ohh @Nkosinathi Masinga Snitching is in the schoolyard....this big time crookery. Dudu was like Epsteins Maxwell..finding compliant people. NIce to know whos manning the whistleblower hotline 😱 @South Africans Behaving Bad *RSA. BB* She started off quite buff but got beaten down quite promplty "@Russia Magezi Dudu was sold out by the mountain of evidence she left in her destructive wake You want the recording lady? "@Russia Magezi 🙂 you right there Caught with her fists in the lying jar You lied to the court here or at OUTTA play her the tape 🙂 lol Wowowowowowowow @Johnno D Or she lied here edited...irrelevant stuff removed not untruthful...lying "@Mr Green Too much "Wow id be quite interested in a pointless re examination and seeing what Mbanjwa would focus on.

Hanifa Hoosen,just wow
Mzalwane Mzala,Sisi Yakhe looks younger today. Trader vs broker Ok @Malik Langa Ola Ms Mbanjwa! Ms Mbanjwa mna ndihamba nawe! Appreciated value In this case the value increased (appreciation). Leave the tweeterati out Ms Ms is not really Miss Continue the count! She's saying Ndzeku and Ms Hendriks fooled her as well. Talk about throwing someone under the blue line bus @thando cezula Continue the counting! @Sindile Moni This one has qualification @melds melds A majority of people who appeared have University degrees and still we are not happy with some of their answers. @melds melds I do not recall that about the many people who appeared in this commission. @Salmaan Abrahams Tribalists are bad people. @Aubrey De Bliquy I agree. @Yolo More Bayacapukisa. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee Fire! @Akhonamandla Gala UNITRA and UNISA Brilliant Chair! Bu BUt Being belligerent never works in legal proceedings and in any interview situation I don't like it when my dear Ms Mbanjwa is this quiet. I miss her. @Maritime Studies Dudu could do that as she proved that there was a court order that she must be investigated. To understand Ms Myeni's behaviour think of Dali Mpofu's argument on behalf of Mr Mokhesi. Count every vote! @Thanda Sibisi Why? 😄😄 The conveyancer was Ms Mbnjwa Ms Kwinana and Ms Mbanjwa @elton van neel Hola @Mango Man 💣💣 @Thanda Sibisi Thank you "Ms Mbanjwa is not conflicted. She represents Ms Memela and Ms Kwinana in all their legal matters Ngxe sisi @Gordon Dallas Why is there an exodus of black leaders from the DA in Gauteng? They claim anti-blackness @Gordon Dallas @Wesley Myburgh 😃😃 @Gordon Dallas The EFF accepts people from all races. The BLF does not accept white people and that is why the FF+ successfully campaigned for their deregistration . @Gordon Dallas Mbali Ntuli will have to come to Gauteng and discuss with this guys. She is in KZN. "@Maritime Studies Why were highly educated and intelligent black people exiled @Maritime Studies Was the education of Sobukhwe not something to be valued? Professor AC Jordan had to leave the country @Maritime Studies AC Jordan left because the government of the day stopped him from taking up a post at UCT.

Simon Nsele,TO ESTABLISH FACTS YOU HAVE TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THE REALITY OR ESSENCE OF THE MATTER.THAT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE INTEROGATOR. LET THE ONE WHO IS INTEROGATED ANSWER TO THE BEST OF HER KNOWLEDGE. "Bonke labo abakhohlisa uDudu Myeni ukuba abe kule attitude yokungavumi ukuphendula for fear of incriminating herself
Shado Brown,:thanksdoc:
Brian Nxumalo,Hand to Hand Courier lol im so close to the end im getting excited😅😅😅
Brian,Her lack of common sense and intelligence is alarming. SAA board member and head of SAAT. Incredulous!! UNBELIEVABLE Unable to create companies and wealth but man whR A massive appetite to steal It's hard to trust any of their qualifications post 1994. This women supposedly is a CA??? NAF This is the best SABC production ever aired. Better the 7de laan W It has taken a while. But it is slowly dawning on her that she is not that clevA I challenge the regulating body for Chartered Accountants to please prove to the public that she is not a CA. If she is the standards of CA's in South Africa is pathetic 😂😂😂 @ Jenny. A very angry trout When does pos Myeni's testimony continue? Her lips are starting to curl down like zuma's when he is cornered Can a CA on this chat PLEASE tell me that she can NOT be a CA?
Joe Soap,confistication..... i'm flattened I can't believe Kwinana is a CA. Pathetic or Deceptive or both....
nhlakanipho mkhize,😂😂😂😂😂😂 she wants to calculate herself yoooh yooooh
Mavis letshabo-kwamongwe,she's a chartered accountant remind me the question hahahaha Zuma appearing on 16th
Natasha Mahadeo,@Wolfgang Redeker LOL 🤣 REALLY!! finally YES 🙄 let me finish🤫 A Red Herring is something that misleads/ distracts from a relevant or important question. It may be either a logical fallacy/literary device that leads readers or audiences towards a false conclusion @Naledi Barron That is so true !
Ayjay York,beware the zeros beware zeros dont give mbanjwa figures please dont give mbanjwa ffigure please accounting 101 are you disputing a profit was earned ms kwinana wrong example kwinana a CA getting figures from a legal persona...

Thanda Sibisi,Should be an easy calculation for an accountant. 10% ia 150million 5% is half that which is 75million “Depreciation” has nothing to do with the question. She is playing dumb. Uyazi ukuthi wenzani! @Unisa Chris. I do not think she is stupid. Only that if you are involved in shady deals you look stupid when trying to evade issues and questions. Thatha Mbanjwa thatha! @Mzalwane Mzala. Exclude postal votes LOL @Akhonamandla Gala Get unlimited data . Worth it! @Thami Mhlomi. Myeni was (ab)using privilege not to aswer Kushubile big time! Poor Kwinana!(Not nice to be in her position) @Ntando Matata My son is a CA. He is definitely not like this. lol @Mtkozi Butelezi. Kwinana IS a CA. I looked it up in the CA website. Accepted 1998 @Do not allow it to be the graveyard of my profession. She is being graceful here.What SAICA does is up to SAICA. @Dan Brown She got it in 1998. May be rusty!🤷🏿‍♂️ @Bhekithemba Ncube “Was” ? Has he been struck off the roll? Pathetic @Lungisani Mufamadi No doubt! Kubi . Poor Kwinana. Mhawukeleni shame! @John Everitt Very true @ Lungisani Nkosi. It was not possible to crucify Myeni! She was not answering questions because if she did she would have been eviscerated. @ Dumisani Mampondo. Fully agree! @ Lungisani Nkosi In the movies it does! It is almost like we are watching a Hollywood movie! @Dan Brown No doubt. Myeni knew what she was doing. @ Maritime Studies. Well allegations against her from other witnesses will stand. If it gets to court she cannot use that strategy. Would land her in the slammer! @Heather Durr Trump is going down period! The poor soul!😭😭 @ Lulekwa Tshambula I think the main issue with Kwinana is dishonesty rather than incompetence. If you are caught out like she is you look incompetent
Sharon Palmer,JZ same WA GROUP 😝 Does she no what FACTS MEAN Now I agree She will have to change color of nail polish for orange overall Lebo where will she get baking powder Who is crying 😭 😝🤣 How can she do internal audit She does not even no where she stays

Obviously they wil fv<# with Trump vote trally anyway the can. Media has been redefining the meaning of EXIT POLLS since 2016 because it is the only pol they can't fake yes @Maritime Studies USA elections are a farce. @wim louw Hey boet can't afford a check up. Have no clue. who is DEMANI? @wim louw When USA sneezes the world gets covid19 @wim louw USA's corrupt oligarchy is very consequential to our planet. @wim louw Trump is not the problem. He is a symptom. Yes @wim louw IMHO These tribalit mentaities have drunk the Apartheid kool ade. Divide and rule is the maxim @Maritime Studies Maybe that is the problem. A black strategy is bount to fail because it defines enmity and division as a starting point as if such a strategy can win. It an't My late father nailed it when Vorster was on about opening swimming pools to all races. The question is not if we swim together but if we swim together or sink together.

Sicence is still in a dark age. @Power Electronics SAFIRE simulated the sun in a chamber and found evidence of transmutation and apparent maive energy output.

Trump is the bottom of the barrel these odious parasites and their self professed political parasites like Biden are even more obscene than Trump who ha abundant flaws. @Heather Durr Don't be ridiculous. LOL Thats a huuuuge red herring. LOL It is inconceivable that a chartered accounted would not know much of what this woman does not know. The Hubris is breathtakeing. She is defending the CA profession. That is why he asks her is this not something a CA should know? If they are all as competent as her then the committee is doing the public a favour. "That mask mut be a slightly darker green chair Any adult married person should know what she does not know. A CA would be familiar with the latin terminology. I bet every one of these black lawyers know that too. I have no doubt when the dust settles a court injunction wil strictly regulate what she is allowed to do professionally. What is breathtaking is that she never saw this coming. Give credit where credit is due. She is a brilliant flannel mouthed snake oil salesperson. Zuma thinks if government changes SOE's have 100% staff turnover. LOL What do you think will happen? Amen @Lungisani Nkosi Let her stand in the corner and restrains the crooks who use her to launder money. I imagine her teachers are the ones who used her services.

But today She is incriminating herself by virtue of demonstrating more knowledge about the farm which is an indication that she has extensive knowledge/details about this matter. Today DCJ has more confidence. The last 3 days were very difficult facing some top dogs of the country. Zuma will come and formally announce discontinuation to cooperate and no one will do nothing

Already over R800m of this commission has costed envisaged job creation for the poorest of the poor. @Maritime Studies ... you are brutally correct..

The State is much broader than SOEs @Tommygun No one of us know whether Ms Kwinana is politiclly active or not @Tommygun @Tommygun Do you know who is the Chairperson of the Public Service Commission? @Tommygun A governing party determines policy and everyone has to follow that. That does not make them supporters of the governing party. I have worked in DA governed structures @Tommygun Richard Sizani is PAC and if he appears here because of the public service commission you will call him ANC and see nothing wrong with that. I have worked in Councils that were led by ANC and by DA and that has never affected my political allegiances.
