Andre Gerber,Bosasa under voluntary liquidation 2 banks closed their accounts yes they fall 1 by 1
Nelson Musoliwa,How can the comm subpoenaed someone to appear before it yet tell him there is some loose ends to be tied before they commence with his issues. ADV Maleka is too sharp than Zondo by far as a legal mind DCJ zondo is misfiring in this issue as cellphone records have nothing to do with Fuzile. The chair is showing favoritism to van rooyen here Hope no one is captured anywhere is SA Political objectives in nuclear deal according to fucile could not supersede future economical imperatives as this huge project could have repercussion on the country economic growth ADV Maleka is a very talented law practitioner no doubt about this periods! "Zuma administration has little regards to professionals hence ""clever blacks"" rhetoric by him and that is why economy stagnated if not collapsed" "Simple put by Fuzile ""you do not swollow more than what u can chew"" ""Money for value and manageable debt""" When Governor Kganyago leave SARB why not give the post to Fuzile to manage our SARB.

Peter Maregere,My guy is back
michael mbatha,Mr Maleka SC. Baba. This discussion with figures and policy is captivating. """Will shake the tree if it means it must fall
Mzalwane Mzala,I ANC umbutho wabantu. We've got no money to waste on gossip. Our people need services. There are consequences for corruption BOSASA bank accounts are being closed Bosasa is going into voluntary liquidation. The banks are closing the accounts because of reputational risks as they did with the Guptas @Anne M. Because of that action of the banks Bosasa has responded by applying for voluntary liquidation. The Guptas did not respond in that way. The sad thing is always the loss of jobs. Chris Hani was non-racialist and would definitely not appreciate his death being used in anti-white people sentiments. Chris was against white supremacy and not white people. Huge difference I agree @Anne M. I hate hatred. I hate hatred. The bible does not encourage me to hate people. I feel sorry for Chris Hani as his name is used to promote something that he disagreed with. "@Neo Mongale I disagree with people at times but I do not hate people I hope @Neo Mongale can see that people from all races are disagreeing with him.

Pheladi Lamola,Zuma was something else
Bright Zishiri,thando nkutha Nothing !
Derek Main,@Tebogo Mokoena You do realise that making such generalisations makes you no better than a garden-variety racist. @Tim Gard Yes - I agree but it starts with not making racist generalisations. @Tebogo Mokoena I'm not trying to say it doesn't happen - but for you to imply that all whites think this way is racist in itself

Matome Ramphele,Lol @Thando Nkutha excatly what I am thinking @Thando Nkutha I just love how he always make up stories - or that he is the best at everything @Thando Nkutha - Or we can keep spending more on it neh üòÉ "@Thando Nkutha - Privatisation would be an option "@Thando Nkutha - And you then have an issue where the Unions are trying to ensure jobs are kept buying votes @Thando Nkutha I think @MIKE LOCK is referring to the chats here! not the Inquiry @Thando Nkutha - It would be interesting to get an analysis of what it would take to ensure that the power stations are operational. In addition how much it would cost to turn Eskom around. "And I think once we have that analysis @Thando Nkutha - I think positions have been created that are not necessary in Eskom. The whole mentality that if you work for government it is a 8 to 4 job @Thando Nkutha - In addition to throwing human capital at problems - which as you rightly say it translates to cost
