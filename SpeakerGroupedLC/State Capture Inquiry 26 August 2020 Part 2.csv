He isnt lying he has a time machine he made the deal in 2015/16 then he travel to the future to sign the deal ... perfect sense. Time travel is what is making him confused... timetravel cause dimentia he must stop time travelling ... its hurting his brain oh crap... he forgot he was the director...
