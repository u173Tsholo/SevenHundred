Orefile Macheoane,sons and daughters of the land "if there is one thing that is dividing the country right now This case belongs to Adv Maleka Why dont the Guptas come here so we can deal with them kindly Im scared our Legal team might return captured "Jonas should have just taken that R600m "The only loser in this case I must say America is now the most well run and profitable country in the world under Trump "@Siba Mfabe True. In light of efficiency Our Army is very limited. So Duduzane refuses to testify. Maleka reminds me of Nel and Le Roux... Knowing the law should actually be standard for every citizen of rhis country "We need the scorpions back. The Hawks are not a reliable bunch @Siba Mfabe i remember that story. i still cry for an independent investigative unit in south africa. We are so far behind the world in forensics anyway. "Thank you Maleka "Our country is beautiful Lol Maleka is defending the country The law leaves room for so much to be desired "he can smell Zuma's blood "Maleka for president  i miss Thuli Only 28 people are watching David Mabuza. Were there no other candidates for deputy president? "It would be unfair to cross examine Jonas "i must say "By the way Ajay wants us to video call him as a country we will wait for them patiently. people love the ANC I remember how the USA flew to the middle east find Sadaam and Osama... We cant deal with 2 harmless guys in suits We welcome back the people's advocate to the stand lol this dude @BABALWA CHUTU we are behind you "this guy will keep talking @Thando Khumalo he still needs to be fair "We are under the ""innocent until proven guilty"" proxy" "The Guptas are playing cat and mouse "This comission might take 3 years This is the kind of lawyer the guptas will enjoy having on their side Vytjie will cry because this guy is not serious. The Guptas havent put forward their version so right now the only this is that they make a mockery of all other testimonies
Real,your government is ruined and south africa will faill if it goes through with these ideas wont end well ewald lol you people have an average i.q of 80 idigienous ?? why not let us whites help rebuild what we broke we know how to build up a civilized society in the west tatenda im european mostly great britan no superiority jist different styles of living whats bantus? why not just say? tribal or ? lol no mate im in australia we built this country whites were brought to australia and doe. yes.
