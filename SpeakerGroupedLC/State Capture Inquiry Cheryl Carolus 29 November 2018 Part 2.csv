Sipho,Bloody load-shedding in Durban
Thembha Mlotshwa,"after Ramathlodi testimony yesterday
Clarence Mentor,Straight knotted ties clearly only applies to male advocates. We have power in cape town. Maybe some load-shedding elsewhere. Eish @Robert Russell We must be protected from load-shedding for we are housing Koeberg Nuclear Power Station and Ankerlig Open Cycle Gas Power Station in Atlantis. Cheryl please talk over the mike. Volume!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The less involved you are in government the more they cut your audibility. It is evidently clear empty vessels do make the loudest noise. Cheryl Carolus is clearly no empty vessel. Juffrou Hofmeyer ek gaan jou by die prinsipaal aanlka. Maak geraaas asseblief. It looks like that lady has stolen the amplifier today. ENCA is busy undermining the SABC.
