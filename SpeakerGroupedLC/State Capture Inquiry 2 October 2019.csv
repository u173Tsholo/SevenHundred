State Capture Commission started on a very High Note today. Thanks to Adv. Mpofu... Colonel Naidoo is a sleeping pill its WMC that sponsor the Violent Protests. dont blame government @Nielsen the only way to fix... Equality is the medicine @Jack Sparrow i agree with you. The Evil(WMC) run everything there's no BMC "WMC is in charge... they are private sector and they are government. ANC is their puppet. it doesnt matter who the president is @Jack Black only own 2.9% of JSE @Jack Sparrow its WMC who donated millions to CR17 @Staffen Ruppert is richer than All ANC members from President to ordinary member combined 🤣 @Jack Sparrow those stats are misleading. just to give us the impression that all is well "@Derek c'mon remember Nick Oppenheimer is White "@Jack Sparrow its a fact @Derek WMC is my problem Ramaphosa is a front of WMC @Jack Sparrow Government is controlled by WMC😁 @Jack Sparrow why do you catch feelings when we mention WMC? WMC doenst mean All White people.. dont be confused. in fact you guys must join us in the fight against WMC. @African Refugee Fight WMC by voting EFF "@Derek Main EFF hates WMC @Heather Cotton so you prefer inequality? Unbelievable "@Jack Sparrow its because you guys rely on media(controlled by WMC) to know EFF. Study our policies... if you dont understand @Heather Cotton no you got it all wrong. we just banned some WMC mouthpieces last month 🤣🤣🤣 "@Jack Sparrow WMC is not all white people @Derek Main Malema love all South African Citizens... "@Derek Main you hate Malema @Derek Main just 1 quote from CiC tht convinced u he's racist @Raven you need to open your eyes. stop hating Progressive Forces @Derek noo thats a political statement. nothing wrong about that. "@Derek you are selective @maluleke VBS song. Floyd is not mentioned on Motau report to have benefited. anything that is trying to link Floyd with VBS is propaganda pushed by WMC "@Derek white people must understand @Jack Sparrow Journalists who are on Payroll of George Soros? i must trust captured journalists over the Progressive Forces who are being smeared? Who's Next?
zintle ndzwangu,Lol always. Mr Mpofu and his handsome self Seems like they are scared of Jamnandas tho.. Whats your take? So will Tom cross examine Papa G or what? Mpofu wont stop talking I can see Tom.. Where is Gordon? I cant make sense of anything Mpofu is trying say or argue. I am no Lawyer but yey andimva tu. @Heather Cotton Hahahaha every court. @Humani Duncan LOL We will still have these thieves on our screens come next year October. Zero arrests.. more looting baseless arguements. Run Jamnadas.. RUN!!!! 😂😂😂😂 """A Minister not involved in the operation of Eskom""? What GIBBERISH is this?" Has Moyane at any point been to testify at this Zondo Commission? Hawu this Lawyer is plain rude nje. Yes she must withdraw Can someone tell this white lady that Listening is a Skill. @Jack Sparrow I think i wouldnt have mentioned it if it wasnt important. What is Tom Crook Moyane jotting down there? Where is his Orange Overall? Are we even going to listen to Mr Naidoo today? Im so over these two thiefs. """This thing will go on forever"" and he keeps on going over the same lame argument over and over. Dali please sit down with your last points" Oooh Lord. Please come and save us from this man This has nothing to do with him being black. He must just sit down. W have heard enough of his stupid arguments @Sebation Nantsika My point exactly. Ngath sekesenza ngesbom futhi suka Sendi dikwe kwa yi tie le yakhe.... YHoooo Bawo kanti senzeni @Siyabonga Dladla Hahahahaha yey ndimhluthi shame @Yolo More Hahahaha i dont know if its ttoo bright or im just tired of his face and arguments. Hahahahaha now we are just being punished stru. Hahahahaha athi let him come and face the music here @Yolo More I also miss Naidoo now Now they are going to waste more of pur money on Teabags and Sugar. Senzeni na? Senzeni na? Lemme also make tea Mr Naidoo needs to round up his testimony. I am starting to get tired of his faceless voice.
McCaswell Khumalo,who is on the stand today? So Judge Zondo is declining this application to cross examine Ghordan?
Allan 28,I see Peter Moyo's lawyer is in the house "Dali has won these argument shem @Eliot Chauke Moyane has Jamnandas by his Jamnandas
makhosi nobhatyi,Mpofu is finished "They are here destroy Gordhan 2015 state capture was already happening Zuma was doing what he pleases "Why are we arguing about this coz Gordhan steals nothing Mpofu just pushes without any facts 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ well stated that is my point @ Brother Louis @ Noshi Maronza Bee I am willing but moyane should answer his version There is no ground to prosecute Gordhan really "@ Noshi Maronza Bee EFF has nothing nothing to push here "@ Carol berry it is bad to be here talk about this issue "Soes was broken during 9 years so what you see now spending more money it is a result of looting in those entities "@Gee Peex you need to check the facts before you reach final answer "Spend more money than saving to fix problems facing Eskom once and for all "If there is a case why NPA not prosecuting Gordhan no one stopped them to do so There is no case at all @ Derek main Gordhan was a finance minister he saw these revelations mr Moyane was not respecting the finance minister @Stellabanda stella he does not want to tell us what he did with Sars all he want to discredit Gordhan by accusing him of maladministration More evidence will be exposed about his shenanigans when he held sars @ Pastor J exactly brother if you remember Gordhan was stating that are facing financial bad dropped moyane he came saying he collected trillions which was rebuked by other witness here that he lied @Pastor J Moyane was serving his master Zuma. Ask yourself how did Jimmy Manyi be able to buy New age newspaper and NTA We are not disputing the fact that Gordhan must held accountable too but Moyane not telling us truth all he is interested in is to say Rogue unit was unlawful Law is law Moyane must tell us truth which charges he put to Gordhan Mpofu is wasting our time now Moyane must say his version first @ Singi Mathebula exactly that is what we want to know Mpofu argument is not state things as lawyer now Zondo ruled out about that supplemental Moyane and Skhakhane report is fraudulent @Yolo more he failed at SABC he must tell us what he did also "Mpofu is becoming weak and loosing his cases Who was interested with this Rogue unit? Only those who was dodging sars and do corrupt and fraud who feels threatened
Sebation Nantsika,This tsotsi’s always act as innocent and smart shame this bokvels True @Raven Mpofu is wasting time black or white Dnt even mention the PP bcos she is your lady This Dali is wasting our data Dali go smuggle cigarettes
Tshegofatso Phaahla,Has anyone been arrested since this commission was established?
Norman Zwane,@tikvah Olam Why would 'they' be afraid. All that is required here is the truth. "@Raymond Mohlamonyane I am not proud of SC Mpofu @Raymond Mohlamonyane I also have my doubts if you represent all Black people officially. I think you speak only for yourself. Your admiration of Mpofu is quite in order but it is not universal. @Raymond Mohlamonyane I'm sure you and Hlaudi are cut from the same cloth. This advocate looks quite tall to me... Not impressed with Mpofu or Moyane. If I was chair I'd reject this application.
TheC4RB1N3,Who set up that report🤔 just blowing smoke screens again This guy😂 but why? "He lies so easy with a straight face "There is nothing to investigate there "If you don't think you have a strong enough case "ooooh lol they spent more than double than they should have on those power stations Is Moyane sitting right there? "Public Protector is holding back the VBS investigations "This is bad
Lesego Ntshid,eff

Kevin Simon,Notshi Maronza Bee BLOCKED QED. (look it up!) "I agree he should cross examine "I Am Free ​@Notshi Maronza Bee  mandisi ntauzana .. Why does Tom avoid giving evidence? Also at the Nugent Commission? Zondo has been brilliant. "pius194 ​.. I think you are going to be disappointed carol berry ​Is monyani still in office? NO Where have you been?????!!!! Not sure if this has come up yet. I suspect FM code refers to Family Member and #
funicanz,Is it Mpofu applying for this application? This guy is still milking Mr Moyane. Yah neh!!! "He gets his facts from :social media analysts. He doesn't have a case here She was on point. "@Robert Russell  *her This guy is loud.
Speckled Trim,"Seems like every office under Zupta administration acted independently in support of the same objective: total control. Though they are isolated All the separate dots make a clear picture. The SC Inquiry broom must clean up with one big sweep. There was political pressure to oppress Gordhan as he was gunning for SC beneficiaries. This is enough motivation This guy is milking his moment a bit The EFF is an ANC-controlled sideshow. They made Malema. Mob-politics is a real thing. The pressure at SARS is reflected here. Capture SARS = Own everything! Capture state from who? South Africa indebted itself We are indebted to the tune of R23 600 000 000 000 Yip that's why other countries own us. State Capture would cause the repayments to be diverted to criminal coffers. Did you see China Military parade 2019?
Humani Duncan,"Mpofu thinks he is a brilliant lawyer but he is so incoherent when he makes an argument "@Raymond Mohlamonyane "@Raymond Mohlamonyane you are disillusional if you believe that "There is nothing more tiresome than arguing with EFF zombies "We are tired of Moyane "@Raymond Mohlamonyane please stop engaging with me "The thieves thought they would go home Scot-free Moyane dismantled SARS and took it to the brink of collapse and that in my opinion that is treasonous. "@African Refugee what a stupid thought process you have "@African Refugee I see you're a Zupta "This is simple "@African Refugee you're so tiring "@African Refugee the floor is all yours "@African Refugee what is your point
Raymond Mohlamonyane,"we as black  "@Humani Duncan .yes "@Notshi Maronza Bee  @Humani Duncan you are not black @Slindile Ngcobo Adv Mpofu is not a VBS looter @Jack Sparrow racists should keep their mouth shut @Norman Zwane I dont need any office to represent my people @Norman Zwane haha you wish "@Humani Duncan @Humani Duncan but i was asking a question. why are you emotional ?

He is laughing @African Refugee I dont agree..it makes people more careful..slows down the ship moyane is nervous..look at him "@Robert Russell yes if he can come aand visit Yes he must be subpoenaed @Singi Mathebula I agree @Raven Penny agree She is implying very clearly that Moyane must testify..hes a coward I absolutely agree with her @Robert Russell i had the same question @Robert Russell hahaha @zintle ndzwangu agree Zondo said he must be quick but he keeps repeating Its just repetitive..we have heard..now Monyane come and testify yourself..dont hide behind your advocates @Derek Main I agree Che! @Derek Main true its how you handle problems

Leonie Hall,"Greetings from #PaySlipbanSA 😃 We want the Competition Commission investigated - all those fines EFF and ANC what a yawwwwn! They both allow black people to be paid less than whites.... 😞 "Hi @Notshi Maronza Bee not Europeans...whites. And it's happening now - look at income inequality data. All political parties are complicit darling "@Raven Penny @Sbo Gumede you are both right. Rising income inequality reflects wage pricefixing
Karen x,Moyane can only cross examin if he gives evidence at the commission
Onie Mtintsilana Gushman,I walked in at the right time... 😃 yes withdraw @Yolo More how is he gubling? @GH MG how so? @GH MG that is your flawed opinion "I just came back ah tea break!
Andrew Mabele,Zondo pls pull gordhan to come answer for his role in stealing from S.A. ns Eskom on its knees him being at helm...even with Zuma there in no proof
Jack Sparrow,"@Raymond Mohlamonyane is the only black person @Heather Cotton Gordhan has stolen nothing. EFF kiddies just make a lot of noise @mandisi ntauzana pravin doesn't want moyane to get his way after nearly destroying sars "@mandisi ntauzana he will allow himself to be tested if the chair decides so. but it makes perfect sense to not just kowtow to moyane's desires. it's a battle @African Refugee doesn't understand terms of reference in a commission @mandisi ntauzana pravin will come across very well under cross examination. and in his court case against the pp. but his objective is to show the middle finger to moyane. i'd do the same "@mandisi ntauzana we will see in his court case against the pp @zintle ndzwangu is it important that she's white? @zintle ndzwangu is it important that she's a woman? "@African Refugee no "i've changed my mind. @African Refugee is arrogant *and* foolish WMC!!!!!!!! all the evil in the world is due to satanists... the role of churches is to push back the satanists satanists run all the newspapers. twitter and that facething too WMC!!!!!!!! Not true. Black Majority Capital is also entering the sphere of control ...and it seems that BMC doesn't think it needs to even obey the laws - unlike WMC @Eliot Chauke the 23% of the JSE that is owned by black folk is definitely BMC @Eliot Chauke the president is owned by BMC. He pretty much started it @Eliot Chauke it's been fact-checked by many we don't all want to bury our heads in the sand "zuma ""invented"" that 3% number "@Eliot Chauke that's true "@Eliot Chauke Government is controlled by capital "government is also controlled by the people that support it "basically they need votes to stay in power "@Eliot Chauke because it doesn't exist. it's not white and the satanists will get sataner @Eliot Chauke if you're talking about fighting abusive power and patterns of ownership then I'm all for it. If you pervert everything by calling it WMC then you're on your own. @Eliot Chauke EFF hates whites "@Eliot Chauke you may notice that white people aren't flocking to join the EFF. For a reason @Heather Cotton equal opportunities floyd and his million buck range rover @Eliot Chauke if you insist on imaginary WMC (which blames WHITE for the problem) then I don't need to know more @siya msiyana i'm free from all that except suffering - my tennis elbow is bad today @Thando Nkutha malema is a little trump @siya msiyana the main problem is too many fornicators and satanists...

Niek Cape Town,ZONDO FOR PRESIDENT !!!!!! THIS IS ALL ABIG SHOW TO SATISFY THE COMMON PEOPLE SHOOT* WE ARE WASTING MILLIONS OF RANDS FOR THIS CIRCUS....A BULLIT IS MUCH CHEAPER LETS START THE ZONDO POLITICAL PARTY
Mangalani Mangalani,16 But what is so difficult here? Minister Gordhan has nothing to hide right? Why does he just set aside a day and see what Mr Moyane has? I am beginning to have my doubts on Gordhan @Carrol berry. He is seated right here She is already withdrawing @I Am Free She said PP report is discredited I conclude the following: Moyane was part of state capture together with Gordhan at some stage There was a fall out Now Moyane wants to spill beans on Gordhan and Gordhan is playing all tricks to run away "@Robert Russel Unlike you I am on the side of the truth @carol berry They both must be questioned to get to the truth. @African Refugee Let’s deal with it after completing this one @Pheladi Lamola Moyane does not deny giving evidence. It is mandatory to provide evidence as part of terms of reference @African Refugee You are right but we are dealing with state capture in the past 20 yrs here @African Refugee I agree but let’s deal with immediate issues before jumpingto the moon "@adrian albertyn The lady adv was hopeless Gee Peex1 Biltong break 😂😂😂

Derek Main,The ANC is the problem - get rid of them and half of our troubles disappear. @makhosi nobhatyi The NPA say they don't have enough resources to investigate and prosecute all the corruption. @Sbo Gumede Then we look for leaders with integrity. @Sbo Gumede I don't think we can do any worse than the ANC cadres. They are corrupt to the core. You'd have to be a real idiot to still vote for the ANC after hearing of all their corruption here at the commission. @Sbo Gumede Sorry? Run that by me again. @Sbo Gumede It's not possible to be more corrupt than the ANC. I agree that all politicians are corrupt but the ANC have taken corruption to another level altogether. @African Refugee No - Zuma just perfected state capture. "@African Refugee Should state capture before 1995 be ignored? Of course not - if you have any evidence @African Refugee Should we ignore recent state capture because the past has not been dealt with. Of course not! @African Refugee So what do you suggest? It sounds like you think the entire commission should be disbanded since the earlier state capture has not been dealt with. Is that your assertion? "@African Refugee I'm all for the commission - if just one corruption case is dealt with because of commission Tell us about VBS Dali. @I Am Free The colonisers are still looting the resources to this day. @African Refugee Quite right - parliament is a bad joke. We should get rid of politicians - they are not worth what we are paying them. @African Refugee Yes - I agree. That is the legacy of colonisation - an inferiority complex. But the colonisers are still plundering despite no longer running the country through captured politicians. @Born free Which part is rubbish? @I Am Free I'm not sure where I said anything about the globalist agenda. The colonisers I am talking about are the countries who have colonised us economically. "@Born free If you have something of substance to say that we can debate @African Refugee Couldn't agree more - we have a class issue not a race issue. And the greed has gone stratospheric. @African Refugee The really sad thing is that we all allow the greed and corruption to continue because we are unable to unite against it. @I Am Free Being a victim is a choice. @Thando Nkutha I put it that many of our divisions are caused by politicians because it serves their nefarious agendas. @Thando Nkutha Huh?! Where did I say anything close to that? @African Refugee The ANC are corrupt to the core - it doesn't surprise me that that they want it all. @Thando Nkutha I think the land question needs to be addressed but not Zim-style. "@Thando Nkutha I don't believe people should simply be given land @Born free I have a house that I am paying a bond on - the bank owns it. I would have no problem with leasing the land my (soon-to-be)house is on. @Shri Shri Kajan Lakhan Not a bad idea but should only apply to arable land. "@Born free I'll go along with that - if everyone else gives up 10% of their land @Gee Peex1 Everybody in this country is scarred in one way or another. Our psyche has been damaged and that's probably why we are such a violent nation. @African Refugee I'm with you there brother - it's the only way we will succeed. Otherwise the politicians will create further divisions between us so they can continue with their merry plunder. "Under the ANC @African Refugee I didn't always think that but the ANC of today is not the ANC of old. @Gee Peex1 ANC is a broad church of bad apples. "@African Refugee Exactly - in the old ANC "@African Refugee Unfortunately @African Refugee Yes - we need a reset. @African Refugee One thing is for certain - we will never eradicate poverty under an ANC government - they are too busy stealing the money. @African Refugee I'd agree with that. We should all withhold taxes and pay them into an account that can be used by the community for their own infrastructure. @African Refugee Yes - I agree. You only have to look at the nonsense that goes on in parliament to realise that. @Eliot Chauke Maybe directly but there are many funds that blacks invest in so it's difficult to tell how much of JSE they own. @Gee Peex1 All facilitated by the ANC - corrupt to the core. @Eliot Chauke Rupert is probably richer than all whites combined - so now what? "@Eliot Chauke What about Patrice Motsepe @African Refugee 😁 OK - we've got a hashtag - now we just need the rest. @African Refugee I'm pretty sure we could put something substantial together. And we at least would have the interests of SAfns at heart. @Eliot Chauke Because it's a BS narrative. @Eliot Chauke Why don't we all fight inequality and that will automatically deal with what you call WMC. @Eliot Chauke EFF are fascists. @Eliot Chauke That's BS - EFF hates whites. @Eliot Chauke Maybe you should tell your leaders that. @Sidney P Huh?! Run that by me again. EFF leaders talk the talk but don't walk the walk. They are taking the voters for fools - and they're right! @Easy D Then we'll have to agree to disagree. @Easy D Malema and the EFF leadership are only in it for the money - just look at the lifestyles. @Eliot Chauke Malema has made it quite clear that he has an issue with all whites - he just a garden-variety racist. @Easy D The only thing the EFF leadership are interested in is money. They are using you. @Eliot Chauke Well then Malema is a liar. @Eliot Chauke No - I have watched enough of Malema's speeches to know exactly what he thinks of me. He's an out-and-out racist and I hate racists. @African Refugee @Danie Nilsen I'm keen for #the alternative Let's get it off the ground "@Eliot Chauke ""I'm not asking for the killing of all whites - at least not yet.""" @African Refugee Hmm - don't have twitter acc @Eliot Chauke Excuse me?!!! I don't think our debate is going anywhere - we definitely see things too differently. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Also dimped FB @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Ooops - *dumped "@Eliot Chauke ""at least not yet"" meaning that at any time they could call for that. In any event @Eliot Chauke Not according to Malema.
Mfana-boy Msibi,Justice Zondo 😁
Sbo Gumede,get rid of the ANC and then what? do those leaders exist @Derek Main? "@Derek Main so are the leader of the other parties "DA 😂
Singi Mathebula,Stupid Moyana again. 😪 We era paying more taxes in South Africa because of Moyana. He protected his friends from paying tax. Are we running short of yellow overalls here? Has Minister Lamula run out of budget ? Let Moyana make a submission to the commission before he can be granted leave to cross examine Mr Gordan Moyana must testify before the Zondo commission. Do you think Moyana is different from Zuma? "moyana cannot continue to be an opportunist She is being paid@Rudi H I don't think so@Omega godi moyana must tell us why he gave GUPTAS illegitimate tax refunds? was that not furtherance of the state capture? Exactly my point @ Lamola. Can my learned friend sit down please? i will never appoint dali to represent me in vourt unless if i want to wear the orange overall. his only advantage is his noise. dali bathoo😪 can you stop there. but he keeps repeating himself. "Dali has just said zondo please stick to you directive as a chair. you give dali a chance to respond and said please be direct .
mandisi ntauzana,Pravin doesn't want to be cross examined Then why doesn't Pravin allow himself to be tested under cross examination as he has made numerous allegations against Tom "But Jack Jack i don't think Pravin will survive cross examination. "Unfortunately the PP case won't have cross examination
Pheladi Lamola,I wish the judge would give Moyane a chance to cross-examine. I just want to see what his plan is. Moyane has no shame at all. To sit there and laugh He's been dismissed @carol berry But Mangalani the rules of the commission say in order to cross-examine you must give your version. Which Moyane hasn't done. What is he afraid of? Crooks 40K was the standard. Awww he's crying Zondo speaking to him like a father to a repentant son who has done something wrong Just goes to show that crime doesn't pay. That's no way to live. 😭😭😭 Haai Keith🤣🤣🤣 How far is the case involving Mangena Keith? Thank you Keith I'm also very disappointed in him
Pastor J.J,@I Am Free Never heard of them but on this chat. sorry @I Am Free I now understand what you are referring to. Thats not a bad idea at all. @makhosi nobhatyi You are so right brother. Moyane has a lot to talk about and answer @makhosi nobhatyi 50Billion I believe This is about Moyane and SARS. Lets not forget that Moyane is deeply implicated in the Bosasa and Correctional Services as well. @makhosi nobhatyi 1000% correct @Robert Russell Correct 100%. Then he can also explain his role about Bosasa and Correctional Services whilst he was Commissioner Mpofu needs to also give evidence about his time at SABC. "Normally when a Judge talks Mpofu is the sign of absolute arrogance and disrespect. @Thando Nkutha I need lots of it my friend On Point Engineering........Anyone recognise this name? @zintle ndzwangu 2 sugars and no milk for me Darling. Thanks @Danie Nilsen Why did I think that you was a double bols and coke man? I salute this witness
Clive White,"I am finding difficult this morning to follow Zondo’s thought process.. It is clear the question before him is one of did he Gordhan He has already rejected the application. This is very important. "That is the point Moyane must speak about his involvement in state capture Now Zondo is beginning to make sense. Exactly That is the big worry The commission will loose creditability Zondo is now having to justify himself Moyane should be handed a 3.3 notice before he leaves the commission. "Zondo must stop Mpofu He keeps repeating himself
Kay Kay,Is the Tom Moyane story back again or what? why not suppose to continue with Mr. Naidoo's testimony today? Zondo seem to have none of what all this people say or want. he look agitated by the argument brought to the fore "See now Zondo is not jumping in as Dali speaks Dali has an emotional intelligence issue Dali's intention is to lay down PG of Roque unit not bcoz of what he said here Tom Moyane is a coward who never open his mouth to talk for himself. he did the same with the Nuggent commission.

Born free,What rubbish Derek. It is the Chinese DEREK and they are not colonialists and neither are the ANC comrades of corruption. Derek you are caught in a time warp free yourself from mental slavery.. immancipate your mind. That was of substance.. DEREK @Derek Main.. Do you own a house or simplex or flat that is situated on a piece of land? Now Derek.. what you said about the ANC.. is substance 😁 from the age of 5 Then themselves 😂 😂😂😂 I think the government should expropriate some of your land and give it to the landless.. Derek Sorry Derek.. no can do. I only own my Unit the land belongs to the Body Corporate. Mandela did not betray anyone.. he became educated and Westernized. Does not mean he betrayed anyone. He became an educated negotiator and preferred peace and reconciliation.. that is wisdom. You are referring to The Corrupt Comrade Zuma.. If I was Mandela I too would have kept away from Zuma. African Refugee.. are you Nigeria or somewhere else? But African Refugee.. whites were the first Black tribes in Africa and the first to explore another continent. Don't for get mankind originates from the cradle of Africa. Sorry to say it but South Africa was better under Apartheid there is no denying it. The Afrikaaner should not have given it a name. The biggest mistake the then Afrikaans government made.. was naming Apartheid. Precisely @Timm I think this country needs a Chinese government who will implement a One Child Policy. But of course The ANC is not the same as the Old because they are now about personal enrichment and greed.
PETER STAFFEN,why does Moyane not come to the table and answer questions "Eliot Chauke please stipulate WMC as i am trying to sort it out  Eliot Chauke who is the majority population in SA so your point is nonvalid Eliot Chauke why dont you fight against corruption that has ruined the country instead of WMC that has taken those people years to accumulate there riches and not at your expense the EFF has proven they are worse than the ANC steel from poor for there own benefit
