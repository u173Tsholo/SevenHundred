Chipo Hamayobe,April 1: Ubaba is witness number 1
Magda Seguin,I think it is Mr Dukwana from the Free State whom Judge Zondo mentioned last week @Yin Yang I think it is possible The news about the book broke yesterday morning...Twitter has been flooded with the news since The journalist who wrote the sent Ace sixty questions two weeks ago before publishingcbut he didnt answer This someone else...maybe Dukwana will come later "Even though he was the lead investigator he did not ultimately make the decision to stop @Entry X what is your problem Its clear that you are trolling @Thamsanqa...they did extensive FORENSIC investigation first Are you kistening to the sane person...he said so at length earlier This witness said they did forensic investigations for two years Not my problem if you dont folliw or understand the details Agrizzi was still working at Bosasa...he inly blew the whistle recently after he left Guptas and and Bosasa are two different issues.The Guptas destroyed all the SOE's...why dont people make a distinction between the two evils? I can see that some people dont understand what is goingvoncin their own country...very sad The SIU's job is to INVESTIGATE and hand over evidence to the NPAand SAPS..read their mandate...it is online Everything has been in thecpublic domain for many years ....more than the nine wasted years of Zuma..remember Bosasa was dominating tenders even before Zuma People call briliant investigative journalists 'stratcom' but they wrote about all the corruption for more than a decade Politicians always deny but since the Gupta emails was uncovered by journalists through whistleblowers who went anonomously to the media and Agrizzi coming forward peopke started talking and noticing. @Yin Yang I agree but look at the EFF trying to suppress media freedom Corrupt politicians depend on the ignorance of the people they are supposed to serve I think the three tiers of government and state entities should be in school curriculums The people have a democratic right to hold office bearers accountable but Ministers are treated like Gods...they are there to serve the country not themselves He left in 2012 There you are @Thamsanqa...he handed over to the NPA and SAPS They were to busy receiving bribes from Bosasa @Planeless Pilot at this pace it can take another ten years to put the culprits in jail "Breytenbach was hounded out of the NPA as she wanted action There are apparently big problems at Brand South Africa...it looks terrible...The world is watching Exactly @Planeless Pilot..news24 article today @Planeless Pilot the heading says: Brand South Africa in shambles Menzi Simelane was kicked out of the NPA and also disbarred Bosasa and Guptas was the toxic cocktail apart from a host of other corrupt acts which is still to be unearthed ...The Ace story is the latest of how he ran the Free State province as his own fiefdom Trolls and bots popping up all the time... There is an army of paid bots on social media...Bell Pottinger style tactics They found fault with his forensic investigation blaming it on racism to cover their evil acts "@Robert Russell the ANC
Wallace Mandimutsira,haibo its 1045 he is testifying on the fact of interference of hawks and justice system
Madelein R,Did you guys see there is a book out on Ace ? We should get it and start a book club with wine 😂😂😂 "@Yin Yang - got my book ""Gangster State""!"

Anne M.,"@Sinawo Qhaji @Thulani Bukani He is ex SIU "@Yin Yang Yes @Desmond Masilela This man was the lead SIUinvestigator into Bosasa years ago which Agrizzi spoke about And the SIU investigation into Bosasa was stopped because Bosasa bribed various people @Desmond Masilela Giving evidence The NPA stopped the SIU from further investigation and we know who headed the BPA at that time *NPA @Yin Yang Definitely. "@Frik Brits I also that it was a guy with the pink cap but looking again
M T,Squirrel will try his Hippo-Faced-Teeth-Bearing lies in The Hague - hope we the people have a truthful representative present! "Mr Zondo ... we need to see justice - arrests - AFU now - before the more than likely orchestrated State Of Emergency being declared "*WITHOUT PREJUDICE* He’ll more than likely instruct EksDom to hit that “OFF” button #Derek Main 🎯👏🏻 #gcina nkosi Ignorance is bliss! Yin Yang ☯️That’s MSM for you! Captured! O my joined a few mins ago 😉 NWO ☯️ 😉
Johnny Cash,Ace and Zuma are the same Ramaphosa jr and Zuma jr are the same ANC is corrupt to the deepest core of life Vote eff come May 19 Zuma and ace must rot in jail vote eff come May 19 and we will make sure he goes to prison in my lifetime ✊🏿eff This anc is corrupt in all ways Every day more and more corruption Never ever in my lifetime did I vote anc May 19 is my first vote and it’s going to the eff✊🏿 viva my CIC! We will never compensate✊🏿 Yes my CIC is also corrupt but Nothing Like the anc! Therefore my vote is for eff✊🏿 Because all politician is corrupt! But anc is the worse by far! ✊🏿eff
CHILL TV,arrest zuma pls

Ravin Jagesar,"nobody is going to jail Anc will lose 20% of the voters to the eff
William Pieters,he wanted a free house. now he wants free land.
Deadbeat Cousin,"In understanding as to how corruption started one has to ask whether a tomato is a veg or fruit Walking barefoot does not necessarily mean you are awake but drinking water after eating can make one angry. Yesterday Real Madrid played but an apple a day does not keep the state away
Derek Main,@Johnny Cash Why vote for anyone that is corrupt? "@Johnny Cash In that case @Norman Zwane Yes - strange indeed. @Thamsanqa Zantsi Sounds like the SIU was interdicted from interviewing those witnesses. @Matthew Adams Yes - the ANC is the common denominator. The ANC is the problem. "@Thamsanqa Zantsi As far as I know @gcina nkosi You're a fool to vote ANC after hearing all this evidence of corruption. @gcina nkosi Do some homework yourself. There are 48 parties contesting. Read their manifestoes and decide which one serves you best. The one stealing the money is not acting in your best interests. @Pat Magwa I agree - it shows laziness.
Paul Mufhadi,people who are going to vote for ANC must think about the next generation. every corner of the organisation is corrupt. the ANC of integrity is gone and forgotten. Wake up South Africa and stop being fed lies. under the ANC the country is doomed.
makhosi nobhatyi,Agrizzi was spot on
Thamsanqa Zantsi,"Not sure how an investigation becomes thorough and informative when ‘material witnesses’ were not interviewed and didn’t give versions Wow....judge Zondo probing this SIU ‘investigation’ properly? C @Magda....this ‘investigation’ is just ‘fishy’ shem....don’t know how ‘extensive’ it could have been when ‘material witness’ like Agrizzi weren’t probed properly. The arrest of Agrizzi was not based Commission evidence or the SIU report? Then what ‘Report’ or other ‘Reports’ was he arrested based on? "@Derek Main Yes. He said so. Then how does the SIU conclude the investigation So Mti also interdicted? @Derek Main thanks for that clarity on the Hawks investigation
Norman Zwane,@Derek Main Sounds like releasing a murderer because they only murdered a child not like the one who murdered an adult @Johnny Cash has a curious logic.
Patric Coxmoore,Which party can i VOTE?
Elpringo da dj,m
david jacobs,@Magda Seguin did they? Not ANC though something seriously soured between wATSON & AGGRIZZI THE SUFFER THEN LOL
John Fagan,Eishhhhhhhhhhh
Tony Jantjies,SIU report
Amanda TV,I will vote ANC because there is alternative or competition i will vote ANC because there is no alternative or competition give options
Ntokozo Kunene,Yerr! they like their tea at this commission.
Joel Mzayidume,@gcina nkosi your logic for voting ANC is strange. There can't be an alternative if you don't vote for one.
David David,dominating in the proper way bra Makhandakhanda saw the opportunity there
Pat Magwa,Claims that there is no altinative party to vote for has no basis only shows how steroo
Dimakatso Tshinaba,what time are they resuming guys This guy is a LIAR!!
Bongani Ntuli,when Adv Maleka is coming back guys? this guy looks already exhausted institutional memory gets lost cde 😀😀😀
The Xilaman,What just happened? Who are they talking about?
michael mbatha,She came back again?
Richardt Human,A lady who stood up last week indicating that she has info to share with the commission And we are not close to a conclusion yet I am afraid that some of them will be dead by then "@magda seguin Yip Really. @Madga Seguin where can I get details on Brand South Africa
Born free,This proves the extent to which Correctional services implicated people and the NPA went to protect themselves and Gavin Watson from prosecution.
