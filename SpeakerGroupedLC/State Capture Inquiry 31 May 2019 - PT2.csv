Madelein R,"Yes I think we are all captured up
Anne M.,I think a lot of people were put off by all the spamming that went on this morning. @Abel Matshidiso üòÅ "Yup @SCELO GUMEDE And there's the connection - Issa is a Gupta crony - who are close friends with our previous president.
Katlego Khomo,Transnet chowed moola mos.
Channel blocker,Lets see how many years for legal action to take place... Zuma's counterparts still active in govt... "this commission should investigate SAA to see why the state has to continuously bail them out next time I want to invest money in a bank I want a floating interest rate... end of show
clive oconnell,"And Zuma wanted these thieves running our treasure All the new deputy Ministers out shopping for 2 new üöòüöòR1mil + each
TVET COLLEGE LEARNING MATERIAL,itjoo people stole money under zumas nose shame
Born free,"Mabuza has a muddied past The delay of Ramophosa 's announcement of his ministers was due to a last ditched plea not to appoint Mabuza as deputy President. These implicated have ruined Transnets reputation anything related to the Guptas is corruptible and questionable. Exactly these ministers are public servants Unfortunately all these financial contractual blunders and misdemeanors have effected any growth in the economy and will have a lasting impact on our economies growth. Yip.. interest rates went through the roof I feel the impact every month. A floating interest rate in our economy would be suicidal
SBH Shembe,"JP Morgan hey @Lee Hendrix will the elite that control everything ever allow Africa to thrive on its own? "yes Money is the controlling factor spot on there... which is really sad to investigate allegations into state capture @Lucy Lucy exactly .. I really liked Transnet
Zola Pinda,Gama has sold black South African entrepreneurs together with his executive team.They all they have to be accountable The executives get paid lots of money. South Africans should hold all executives accountable. Executives were there. They must all account. It can't be just Gama and Molefe. All executives should account. They were part of EXCO. NPA should take over. There's enough evidence to get the best picture. State Capture looters must face our mighty law. They must have sleepless nights. State owned entities are not private companies. The appointed executives are obligated to differ with their 'bosses' they are all civil servants at the end of the day. It's silly of the Transnet executives to only blame Gama and Molefe. They must all take responsibility. EXCO members must tell us as tax payers what happened.
Floyd Ramoshaba,what purpose does this inquiries serve?
Piet Madimetja,When this executive of transnet going to appear at the court wakeup Npa We want those millions and billions back. They can create more jobs.
Mzalwane Mzala,Why are Gama and Molefe's names appearing a lot. Did these other conspre against them? Did they conspire?
