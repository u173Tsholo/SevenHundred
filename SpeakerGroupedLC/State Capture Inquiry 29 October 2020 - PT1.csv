DCJ lose the attitude pppffftttt @dada ngova You talk crap--that is my friend-he said nothing of the sort STFU @Eddie Reddy It only became a relic after 2000 "@Abdul Kader S The Yanks have Blackops Hodes has been Malema's attorney for 10 years. Hodes has always acted for shady slippery characters CNN here we come-Ramaphosa makes me wanna hurl 79 000 new COVID overnight in Maggotland @Ntsikelelo Vani Hodes is known for being seedy and sleazy and acting for shady clients-its easy to get a guy to contradict himself on a blurred video where you put words in his mouth. @Aubrey De Bliquy So what did my sister die of @Aubrey De Bliquy dont go confirming your fascination with conspiracy theories and dont underestimate my ability to identify facts that are scientifically proven @Aubrey De Bliquy Oh I do so love passive aggressives I trust they are going to make up this time over lunch DCJ is determined t o have his lunch 🙂 I thought he looks like that guy who rode into Ventersdorp on his Horse-Piet someone @Jenny Whitewaves Thank you for all you do Is it just me or is this oh soooooooo boring

Tommygun,just joined but suspect anyone who approved anything at all in favour of VRLaser is a crook Mr Drevin sounds like he was pushing for a final paycheque before leaving the sinking ship.... sounds like hes worried that even fiddling the figures the contract with vrlaser wldnt go through. @Gugulethu Xhosans that dudu was involved in a front company buying locomotives... @moegammat africa it seems like giving contracts to VRLaser (essa/gupta) without getting value. LMT were a subsiduary of Denel..cant understand any reason for not using them and going to VRLaser. Which i guess is the whole rub. for the discerning witness nice @zip reeper a mouthful of a name to the uninitiated please... "@Brian Is Me this is the peanut gallery "@Aubrey De Bliquy Its a mostly asymptomatic pandemic dude. Not hard to get.

Aubrey De Bliquy,Maybe Zondo has shares in Armani. We need an investigation. tea break yes extended tea tee hee hee "@Heather Durr Yes @Ntsikelelo Vani U was watching. That lawyer is a shark. I was watching. @zip reeper I live Jimmy Dore. The only sane one around. love this has been a king 25 minutes long @Ntsikelelo Vani I know the mindset of the witness. That Malema lawyer is like all an imoral shark. He knows the false equivalencies and red herings in and out. He can make an innicent guy look guilty He probably can only speak afrikaans and the interpreter can't speak afrikaans to save her life. Peanut gallery here @Tommygun Has anyone noiticed zero credible evidence for the corona scam? They could have doine this any year they chose. And flu mortality has dropped dramatically. LOL corona cures flu? LOL @Heather a real illness of questionable genesis. Obviously and totally choreographed and 80% BVLL$#1T @Heathe please dont give me that lame anecdotal BS. I love you and care about your loss of a sister. She could have died of the flu or covid complications. Why you so keen to endorse a scam? To my knowledge this alleged virus has not yet been identified and nobody has ever therefore been proven to have died from it. @Heather Durr Yeterday you proved you spent your time trying to learn Latin at university but do not know Memorandi is the plural of Memorandum. LOL Pleeease spare me.. Your expert witness credentials and credibility don't match. @Tommygun Exactly and the reaction is irrational and orchestrated. @Heather Durr LOL change the subject when your BS runs out of runway why don't you. Hehehe How about another red herring. bickering can be fun and eblightening. Whys should the devl get all the coverage.? I never laughed so much since my mother in law fell off the bus with arms full of plate glass dishes. LOL @ALTA Plenty of kids. Love them as long as I breathe and then some. @ALTA what will happen if I bounce s plit pea off a base drum into the atlantic ocean? "Why are we so dumb en masse? Asl Edward Bernays ]Non sequitur I have been litening to all these witnesses closely All of them are doing their job as best they can. You wont find the scum at this level. It gathers at the top. @Heather Durr If I remembe from yesterday you gt an attack of boredom at the oddest times. LOL Hi @Louis C Is housekeeping short hand for something confidential or do you care to share? hI The s#1t started before 1910 Boil dagga leaves slowly so you don't lose the medicine. Weird why this was ever an illegal herb. It seems it was just a mistake. @L. M 100% But not just political power. All power including money and especially money. @L. M 100% and recognizing it is the first step to fixing it. @Naledi Barron 100% Does our country proud as a moral and llawful young democracy under heaven.
MOLLY PHUNGULA,so the commission is adjourned this adjournment is too much zondo is very strict shame my lord
