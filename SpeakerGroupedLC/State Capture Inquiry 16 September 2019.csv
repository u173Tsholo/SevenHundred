Lorna Kavanagh,everyday that the commission is not sitting is costing the tax payer. It is his problem not ours... the witness has no lawyer and wants to postpone again. I say that is his problem and the commission should just go ahead as this is costing taxpayers . He can't get s lawyer and wants the commission to give him one

ZA Judiciary very keen on their breaks to the extent that very little appears to get done on a daily basis . The same applies to this Commission
