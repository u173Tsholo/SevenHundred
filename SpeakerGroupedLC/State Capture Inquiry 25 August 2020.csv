Asanda Dikela Twala,Thank you Chair. The Evidence Leader must always give background we dealing with many cases here. was already busy googling who is Mrs Dube. "lol we going to have a long Day @Akhona Gala @Esme Van Heerden lol we not sure how u guys want the Chair to do that. i hope its clean and no pun intended lol HAHAHAHA we r also annoyed by his line of questioning loo evidence leader lowo no flow or whatsoever can't identify heads of the discussion @Ridwaan Ismail lol that is an assumption u making there lol the Chair is swinging again as soon as she mentioned Uncle GWEDE lol yangena iStellembosch Madoda lol am not saying anything but yeeeeeeey Evidence Leader buvuliwe mkhuluwa wam. @Akhona Gala HAHAHAHAHA No No No your Comment is not Commissionery guys dnt forget we having a Cross examination with the Enterprise Minister the one wa Rogue unit "we reject the excuse from this witness 
Martin Krul,agree
Maxwell Sibiya,😂😂 Already Googling 😂😂😂 Ay! Ayanda. I agree with you though Evidence leader did a opening statement. Chair decided to show him how it's done. "@Akhona @Quinton We dealing with Bosasa today. about 3 witnesses expected. 2 already skipped us today @Garth if that's the case. the commission missed out on a great Adv. "The questions might be the same "Once the chair start asking questions himself like this
Confidence Sibanda,🤣@Asanda we indeed dealing with many cases
Nicollette Ferguson,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THE FACT THAT THE WORLD IS WATCHING it's not a long list 😂😂 Letter of appointment?
makhosi nobhatyi,"Yes Agrizzi
Akhona Gala,This evidence leader and that white old lady are not the best in the business bayantantazela "@Max I'm not sure where is he "shame Ms Dube looks scared 🤣🤣 "Nomvula likes 🍖 🥓 meat that is why she's so ""Mama-Action"" nogals stolen meat" 🤣🤣🤣 Evidence Leader is annoyed by the movements 😂Asanda uyandigqiba😂 😂tjo tjooo Ms Dube is telling everything as is @Angel 😂😂😂 Thanks Ms Dube that was very entertaining and annoying at the same time @Asanda yangena iWhite Collar Crime 😆 Justin i also don't like this evidence leader he's look warm "@Sidney 😂😂 enough there's a new witness on stage now ok sorry Sidney i withdraw continue to attack Ms Dube. It was very brave of her to come to the commission and i think she did much better than Zuma interms of answering Q's
Jan Kruger,I'm surprised the chairman so calm when he was told two persons are excused for today. Usely he's serious and talk about the little time that's left for the work of the commission. So what if Bosasa paid for a birthday party?... someone help!
Quinton Ndzinisa,greetings all who is testifying today?
Kevin Simon,Passive aggressive witness
Esme Van Heerden,"@Maxwell Sibiya yes "@Akhona Gala true
Siviwe Ratsibe,Witness full of attitude
Tom Thumb,@Maxwell Adv Malake has gone back to private practice to make more money from this thieves:yougotthis:
Vanita-Joy Meyer,She initially worked in the kitchen!! Definitely Sifiso! They both seem to want to lead the evidence Yes Sifiso thats why the chair was providing guidance I feel you Mark - about the chair finally!! Sit STILL lol jacob zuma!! @Angel Mtshali unfortunately that is true
Nkululeko Njapha,so?
Sifiso Kheswa,There's a head on collision between the Evidence Leader and The Chair Vanita I think it's a competence issue. I feel the chair doesn't have faith in the evidence leader
keresemese mofokeng simon,I wish NPA could utilize Ad Hoffmeyer to be their one of prosecutors to prosecute the state capture criminals.
Tazzy C,Anxiety in the house
Henry Oosterwyk,having this on helps me sleep
Motlalebona PTY LTD,"this commission is not organized
Solutions SA,the swinging chair is a problem.... She is too comfortable lol sit still... stop swinging lol. i said it Mama Action must come back to explain this special delivery plastic chair will do lol waste of time she is going to buy that chair at her house lol lol @Akhona Gala Whats enough? She was asked if she needs interpreter and she said she is proficient in English. Yiu cant blame others for her incompetency. @Akhona Gala Very codescending of you. Now yiu dont like the evidence leader but sympathetic with witnesses When you commit crime oneday things will come out in the open for everyone to see your shinanigans... @Singi Mathebula If that happens I'll pay for your drink... @Angel Mtshali Not tax but Bosasa bribery He can't do anything @Kevin Nit when Ace is SG loooool😂😂😂😂 Mortals like us ??? @Angel Mtshali Tea break Aii Today's witnesses are boring He is finished too Aiii Waste of resources Bosasa paid for Nomvula's birthday party. I wonder how she will argue this one Cross examination of Mokonyane will be very interesting @Derek Govender she must appear to clarify this revelations
sithembinkosi hlophe,@Motlalebona i agree with you @ Asanda looool
khuthadzo moji,I think this witness was supposed to have evidence on her home language then have interpreter.. I think things was gonna flow finally Mrs Thomas don't Wana come to the commission
Justin Damons,"Its the nerves Guys get this lady an interpreter. this isnt working Chair dont like this evidence leader.
Peter Solomons,interpreter PLEASE!!!
Ridwaan Ismail,she dont have that type of chairsa ate her house
Thabo Mokoaleli,They also did Birthday for Jacob Zuma🙈😅😂🤷 Fikile Mbalula and Gwede Mantashe were frequenting Bosasa Office 😅😂🤷 "All these ZuGupta Nexus are habitually pathological Liars. Zuma refuted everything
pmlaba9,"Miss Dube she must behave its seems like she forgot where she is
Ndivhuwo Eric,"anxiety is dealing with her "I feel for her
Mark Tshoni,i feel like holding that chair so that she sits stills
Angel Mtshali,The witness needs both a still chair and and interpreter... @ Akhona. I am so disturbed. I could not follow. Too much swinging and lack of vocabulary to express herself. @ Sidney. I 2nd the plastic chair!!!! At some point it came across as though Ms Dube could and wanted to say more but either the nerves or the language stood in her way. Anyways ke sizwe the new witness. None. Kufikiselana ngenhloni thinking our leaders are/ were / have been out there partying at the expense of the tax payers. We had been taxed so they can party. Total function costs!!!!!!!!! @Martha Motuba: Those orange overalls are for mere mortals like us. sadly. @Derek Govender : Arrests don't happen for those people. It's court cases and appeals!!! Was bout to say!!! I need a break too @ Sidney P Ms Dube could have done this too but the chair and language!!!! A cross examination is much needed here.
Glenda Olieslager,"Swinging in the chair like a child
dada ngova,she is very poor too much dithering bloody go
Conproc zambia limited,@Sidney P lol
Ndaxola Mdrai,why is this witness here? hopefully there will be few of those who attended the party who will be coming to collaborate this testimony otherwise it is just a waste of time. or cross examination will give much more insight
Melor Hadebe,sometimes you ppl are annoying... this lady will help connecting dots since Nomvula denied everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Margareth Waterboer,@Melor Hadebe I agree with you. The chats on here focus on irrelevant observations instead of the evidence given. And she gives away very important facts implicating the big fish.
Siyanda Sithole,The evidence leader has never been this happy 😃😃
Singi Mathebula,from 80 to 120 to 270🤭🙈 we are lead by liars 🙈 PPE thugs will be in correctional service
Ramogale Selebogo,Anyway there no arrest and they will never b This is so useless
Dread Man,baboshwa nini abant
Gugu mathobela,he is saying he took back leftover liquor:elbowcough:who does that. his such a liar "Thank you payment
Wildthing,any photos Mr Lana haircut should have some photos too of the guests. or we can hunt Facebook for her friends. Lama.
Kieron Sinewave,Events organizers do that XD
Martha Motuba,"@ KD Sibisi "who is this man (with own hairstyle) just came now "@Angel Mtshali and Derek Govender Mokonyane said they will pick up a rand when our economy was downgraded
kevindbn007,Soon hopefully - CR surprised us with his open letter on corruption lets hope he acts on his statement
Lesego Letlhake,let's see
Derek Govender,With all this evidence why is Mokhanyane not being handcuffed and taken to a police holding cell as she lied under oath?? @Angel the question is WHY SO??? Surely there must be photographs taken at that function @sidney P she already appeared before Zondo but lied through her teeth like all ANC members from Cyril down @Sidney P but if you or myself lied we would have been behind BARS by now right!!!
Martin Radebe,Don't forget y'all that this gossip has already cost taxpayers R1 billion.
Monnakgomo Lekganyane,Mara this Ms Dube was a poor witness hle...she doesn’t really follow. She often jumps before the gun 😨
R.m. B.,So far this is a joke! Is there no Contempt of Court applicable here? Zzzz... Hear hear!
Zakhele Tshabalala,THEY R ENJOYING THIS AS LONG AS IT DRAGGS ON THEY ARE GETTING PAID
