Heather Durr,Bravo DCJ Euuuwwww that tie So much fuss over 1 page @sanfran and DCJ together with the evidence leaders must consolidate the evidence and make recommendations. Hi @ALTA and all other dear friends @zip reeper and he has long service certificates and a watch at 25 years service @zip reeper Lol that happens in every company @Goaten - Zondo feels f**** for Malema @Goaten - Proof that Zondo is scared of Malema. I'll wait ! @Goaten - Zondo said he was CONSIDERING and subpoena's require time and research as to what specifically you want Does this guy know he is supposed to be throwing all under the bus-I much prefer that lady yesterday @Goaten - A lawyer has no rights in this commission other than the technicalities. Very very few have lawyers-you have such a crush on Malema @Goaten - Malema's current lawyer has been with him for 10 years and is used when he wants to throw mud and is known to act for people of questionable character "HAH 'Hind sight""" @Goaten - Maybe that is why he picked a white lawyer @Goaten - you mean Malema and the evidence leader Someone on this forum just said that Zondo swatted him. @Goaten - its a wonder Zondo got the job @Goaten -You see thats not how it works-the witnesses get grilles by specialised x examiners. Zondo listens and enforces the rules.This is tiring. All these Malema puppy dogs hanging on his every word *grilled @Thanda Sibisi True. But will a woman work GOTCHA If I can just give context The technical guys were honest and great at their jobs. THIS guy had a problem with taking instructions from black people.

Uncle G,"Chair - we do not say it looks like the aircon is noisy
Goaten -,I see Malema isn't least bit scared of Zondo. I have been seeing vids on YouTube of Malema telling Zondo to bring it on. Malema got balls unlike Zuma. To scare Malema is almost impossible. I respect that guy for his bravery. I must say. Malema never said black lawyers were incompetent. He said the black lawyers he hired for some case were incompetent. EFF has high profile black lawyers like Mpofu and the guy with dreads. Seems like Zondo is the one who is scared of Malema now. Lol was watching a clip were Malema was making fun of Zondo's voice calling it a BARRY WHITE VOICE 😢 @Thanda Sibisi yes that guy... "@Heather Durr well wasn't Zondo supposed to subpoena Malema's bank statements? And now that Malema has said he can go ahead  It was the law firm handling the matter Salmaan. . @Heather Durr and we are still waiting. ..Malema said he doesn't even need a lawyer when he appears before this commission. @Heather Durr that is a lawyer's job like duh. They act on behalf of whoever they wish even if it is questionable characters in the eyes of the public. @Heather Durr I want to see this showdown between Malema and Zondo.. @Heather Durr lol ZONDO will also tell you that he was grilled hard by Malema for the deputy chief justice position. Someone promised to pay for my rent that month. @Heather Durr no Zondo was owned in that interview. It is simple just type Malema grilled Zondo here on YouTube and you make up your own mind. @Pastor J. J yeah he said he would pay for my rent . I have his email address and he asked me to send him the invoice. @Heather Durr lol I am not even Malema's fan but I respect the fact that he got balls and not intimidated by anyone. @Heather Durr Zondo also grills witnesses though. I have seen him do that. Anyway bye guys. I need to figure out how my rent will be paid this month. Have a lovely day.

LionView,Goaten (SB) baiting yourself? 🤣 just like i said (SB) watch how the troll Goaten baits her self lets make Sarah Britten work hard between tabs. Just time the posts inbetween users and you will see how they are the same person. Sad thing is you have a child of colour now and still lose continuously. Bye Sarah Britten
Phakamile Khuzwayo,malema a hypocrite big time what is a different between malema and bushiri? "@lwanda manela ""elethu""" "@sabelo nxumalo hai Zwide itshe ligaya ngumunye umhlathi @pastor jj he is a former kaiser chiefs and he used to play with eye glasses "@pastor jj u also correct it's just that I knew him the time he was playing for kaizer chiefs
Thanda Sibisi,@Salmaan Abrahams Amen! That is the problem with “revolutionary politicians” They do not practice what they preach. @ Goaten You mean Ngcukaitobi? @Mthabiseng Morabe. Pravin is a small fry. I want to hear Zuma explain how he allowed the Guptas to be so powerful not stalling & employing delaying tactics @zip reeper> I hold no brief for “Jamnandas” however I have not heard specific allegations against him other than get the general feel that the EFF and the RET factions of the ANC do not like him. @Heather Durr Myburgh would not do for Zuma.He is a bit too aggresive in cross examining. Zuma would walk out claiming it is not yet a court of law but a commission. @Bennie Deysel Had a 26 hour power cut yesterday. Do not know if it is Esihkom issues or cable theft. @big feet Ratha? @Fred Desrosiers True no one wants to be blamed for giving up core business & “donating” R100 million.Obviously some were “under pressure” & others got a cutof the deal . @Anne M It was all about theft.Sadly this criminal saga has become politicized thanks to the involvement of some politicians like Zuma. @Jabu Malinga At least Ramaphosa & Motsepe acted within the law however flawed.What we are seeing here is something else . @ Mbuso Ndlovu not sure if Zondo “cheated”. This was a long time ago. Was he even married? @GB Dudu Myeni! There is going to be drama!
Alhadiah Khan,Heather i concur with u . check the interview for Zondos interview for his job malema interviewed him. Zondo gsve hom no respect
