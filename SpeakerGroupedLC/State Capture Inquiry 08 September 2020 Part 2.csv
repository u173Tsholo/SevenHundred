I wonder if the ANC will properly apologize one day? @Lukas Drogba THE HOLE AFRICAN CONTINENT AND ME 😉👍🏻 Do you get fired if you don't join The corruption gang that is the ANC ? "440 Million for Cuban doctors The ANC as a company would supply inmates to all the jails around SA. @Vanessa 🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣 One would have thought that the Gang would stop after Zuma left. EFF just trying to look relevant EFF struggling with infighting ANC members must ready themselves to go 12 rounds when they pass on. 🤣🤣🤣 I love happy people "🤗Life is short @Andre Ackerman Yip The poor seems to be the most uninformed.... "Pie and coke Is there actually a party that can change things around in South Africa? Or start sending ANC officials to jail until they find the honest ones?

Hlagala Masetlale,will Zuma and company still be alive by then? i hope they will not be fighting for stay of prosecution if that's the case then it will go beyond Thalente represented Duduzane his father is probably they have wanted to launch a joint venture of corruption he is throwing Zuma under the bus who was taking the minutes?can the commission have access to them?i don't zuma will remember this the tsotsi is working very hard the meeting was like a cabinet briefing niehaus must be mention along the tsotsis akhonamandla Carl is likely to have an official state funeral if Ace is the president @akhonamandla remember he will be having 3 days experience who is this jabu?isn't this guy from vembhe in Limpopo? @thapelo they will remember everything. Don't forget that the trial date is 2058 so the actual chairperson of eskom was dudu myeni @Tlou they must absorb all investigators and advocates of the commission into the NPA maybe some prosecution will take place. I recommend Hofmeyer to be its director "@LadyT a meeting was scheduled at the president 's residents to discuss the removal of three eskom executives @Thobani myeni 's son thalente was was @@Thobani governance and appointments of ministers is
Lethabo Maesela,zuma is a criminal. wow
Norman Krakra,Howizt Carmen "Duduzane was given the mandate by his dad These are the people who worked together in order to destroy any trail of where the huge amounts were planted If one follows this commission it`s more about making a collection of all the money launderers and thieves. In due course will they all be stashed in jail (hopefully). Law students pls take notes "Zuma never remembers anything Spot on Deon A big one Ettiene Riaan that`s an Elephant:elbowcough: :elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: "Madiba Mbuso we are in deep trouble today due to short memory (rather selective).....no point in condoning it....

"Mbuso....it might have been the reason Decomposition of their secrets Mbuso.......it`s beginning to smell/odour "It is however a shame how these guys conducted themselves....

Phillip Cwazibe,Dudu Myeni?????
Carmen James,Hi @Norman Krakra Dudu and Thalente Myeni!!!!!! Why was Dudu Myeni at the meeting? What was her role at Eskom? So what does the Chair of SAA have to do with Eskom??? @Norman Krakra Dudu Myeni messed up SAA and Eskom by the looks of it Zuma and Myeni .......deep poison yup @ma baker Ms Myeni is the FIXER
Akhonamandla Gala,why was Talent at that meeting? but Duduzane is nothing at Eskom lol "one thing shame about Mr Tsotsi Krakra unyanisile "lol he even remember all the names is Zuma entangling Myeni? lol @Kids @Krakra why mention Carl Neuhause in the whatsapp group of Madiba? @Hlagala indeed Carl is a Tsotsi Carl even faked his mother's death @Krakra😂 "@Hlagala 😂😎 Category A State funeral for Carl @Hlagala Des van Rooyen will be our finance minister at that time @Krakra you know mos our movement doesn't really believe in youth advancement "@Behind 😂😂 @Pillay ANC can't pay it's salaries but you guys still want to apply....... lol go ahead on the other hand it is not easy to believe someone named Tsotsi Ms Myeni was the Mistress of this country during the 9 wasted years. history will judge her harshly i Zumas case postponed to 8 Dec "Mr Tsotsi 'there's a Zulu word EFF thugs are harassing journalists now! those guys likes attention "lol @Krakra that's what I've noticed @Thobani there is a possibility that maybe Dudu and Talent were staying with uBaba lol "let's go up to 5 o'clock @Thobani you like to throw 'wow' waya waya in your vocabulary neh:elbowcough: "@Thobani Zuma and the Premier league were running the affairs of the ANC "@Thobani from now on you are Mr Wow 😂 "@Yolo hahahaha howzit? no go home "@Thobani i was wondering the same thing 😂😂😂😂 it is very strange Mr Zondo when Ms Myeni chairs Eskom board with her son Talent in Zumas residence in Durban...... "@ William @Riaan from 2007 there was no plan. they compiled a vision and called it a national development plan under ANC government this country was leading the African economy and no ones was complaining Tsotsi looks exactly like guilty Bill Cosby when he's looking up @Ndumhie 😂

TLOU MASOGO,wen it comes to zuma zondo has lot of questions but yesterday was not much interested about 7 police guys at NW I'm telling u mokoena his is interested shem no there is lot of he say "what I see is going to happen is that after the commission  right now the commission has spend all most a billion rand that we need as a country during this covid 19 @ dominic we continue losing money bcos this commission does not come to end I mean even now there is now draft report produced by zondo mr tsotsi no man he was doing nothing this guy they want to open the commission again OUTA make me sick sometimes but zondo should have gave him chance to go through the audio I mean its fair that way
Dominic Przybylski,Cadre deployment gave ANC full access to bank accounts of all SOEs. @TLOU MASOGO R1 billion is a small fraction of the tax money lost in a couple of months due to making sale of cigarettes illegal. SA sold to the lowest bidder more likely. "@TLOU MASOGO I share your frustration Regardless of what Zondo recommends I don't expect it to result in anything except for a few speeches in parliament. Ramaphosa is all [soft]bark and no bite. @KylePGraphics NPA still not ready to take Arms Deal case to court - 15+ years later. Whatever happened to Afriforum's private prosecution project? Only result has come from civil case where OUTA got Dudu to be declared a delinquent director. But she is still director of 5 companies. Nobody takes law or ethics seriously in this country. Nobody with political connections gets punished for breaking the law. @TLOU MASOGO OUTA still only organisation which has achieved some results. @Jacqui Baumgardt It has been widely reported - use Google. @Jacqui Baumgardt Alternatively contact OUTA directly. Soviet training of ANC youth instilled communist propaganda into ANC consciousness. Unfortunately the inevitable failure of yet another communist attempt is being interpreted as a racial failure. @Kwo Thanks for reminding me. I've got better things to do.
Arctic,"the reason why I ask is because VBS happen around the same time the commission started or rather earlier  you dont need salary at Anc you get paid via Tenders "@Trevor yes  corruption will NEVER end unless the country has a complete overhaul of the justice system and proper limitations on parties guidelines they should follow ........ "so it's clear joining government is nothing less then a low earning job and the only reason you there is for change  "anc fight hard to hold power and there jobs 
Luqmaan Rawat,okay. so whose going to jail yet... lol so all the money that was stolen was odne so well? not even the banks know where it went? @TLOU MASOGO there is enough evidence...theres just not enough political will do prosecute
monty manamela,The surname has answers......😂🤣 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 "Now he has a problem of recalling people in a meeting. We are led....😂 Former Chairperson answering like an additional member of informal organisation...
Master Letsoalo,"Is it ""Tsotsi"" testifying ?"

Lesedi Mofokeng,why does both Tsotsi and the lawyer have accents? @Seelan&Patsy Pillay easy baking 101 🤣🤣
Michael Michael,Mr T dont telling the truth. he is not telling the truth.buckets of lies.
James Godloza Godloza,they just amnesia as an escape as they know that they can't be forced to remember is npa represented in this proceedings maybe as a country we should settle for naming and shaming and forget about prosecution "Riaan they will never do that what does this tsotsi recalls bye guys can't continue listening to this skelm
AKBERALLY OMAR,lesedi mofokeng. They must be from Zim or pretend to be white. Elton Josea. That's what tsotsis do.
Vanessa Van Vuuren,he better put Hes bed on high bricks the tokolosh is coming for him. never ever looks lime we are still waiting for the transformers thats why we have loadshedding Japanese has excellent technology . even the trains we bought do not fit our tracks 🙈 yes There are many free wifi spots in each city I do t know I suppose not😢 noone has secretary's or HR departments to deal with business. in our country the bosses make the business. what the F was Talente doing at a meeting!!!! waiting for that armsdeal case yes if you dont do what gupta say A absolutely a Company maybe Clicks because they all clicking together
Angelo Doubel,🤣🤣🤣🤣 @venessa🤣🤣🤣 @ welcome back Lady T. it's just about meetings with Zuma and Dudu. Board meetings dates. @ Lady T Saxonworld meetings. ANC fundraising dinners. @Bhudda: type of system political corruption in which private interests significantly influence a state's decision-making processes to their own advantage. @ Riaan😂 golden handshake🤝
Kwo,51% loss in our GDP brahhhhhhhhhhh thanks ANC thanks "ikr @Annie Maharaj this man makes me fall asleep "@Riaan DW with the 1994 ANC yes I hope the united states of africa is soon formed that way we won't be ruled by the idiotic ANC a state of shock....mmmkay buddy chameleon 😂😂😂😂 "I'm just listening to spotify waiting for 5pm for my power to go off "EFF is busy going crazy trying to hurt any company who looks at them @Thobani Mkananda They are the Popular Movement of the Revolution party of the DR Congo I've gotten so bored I'm now just watching those Pakistan Memes lol
Annie Maharaj,At the pace this enquiry is going on! We Might all be dead by the time its over ! Zondo needs to be more upbeat and move at a faster pace Norma Krakra 🙈I know ! Thats how the law works !!But it is so frustrating
lyss,Hi
Jacqui Baumgardt,"@Annie Maharaj he needs to be through so that there are no 'appeals"" later" Uh-oh - throwing Cyril under the bus @Dominic Przybylski - please send me proof I want to follow this up which companies? @Kwo - have a powernap @Dominic Przybylski will do @Vanessa Van Vuuren - I hope they have video tapes of the EFF members creating havoc at Clicks and that they go to jail for malicious damage to property
Lucas Drogba,anc apologize to who
Ghost Mapetla,SA sold to the highest bidder cash in transit heist is nothing to what this mafias are going with a suit & tie plus a big smile Corruption is the only job ANC have is sad to the vision our elders have for our land ANC is just like Bafana Bafana they were showed there cuts commission is a gig these people took oaths hard to believe for the love money our country caught fire together we can do more the ice is melting
Elton Josea,tsotsi is lying calmly

Thobani Mkananda,Tsotsi appears not to have an appetite to take ownership of what was happening at Eskom. He's tiring me actually @N.G Which newspaper is that? "@Riaan @Banathi 🤣😂 Don't ask me about them "@KWO @Kwo Even worse!

Thanks 😅😂🤣😅 @Riaan We love you more brother 💙 We can't afford to be always despondent @Yolo More Is he getting expropriated without compensating his virtual community? 🤣😂 @Akhonamandla Where's my brother @Aubrey Van nton-nton? @SABC Where are the visuals? "@Akhonamandla I hope he's fine. People like him can be seen to be posing a threat @Yolo More 😂🤣 You must do the honourable thing therefore and duly compensate this virtual community for taking him away 🤣😂😅 @Yolo More What do you say about people who were not involved in stealing him and found him here. We'd be at a loss as community without him. 😂🤣😅 Compensation or death 😅🤣😂😂 @Aubrey Welcome back 😅😂 @Yolo More knows our demands as this community.

Luzuko Mgotywa,that's not my question @Thobile
Andre Gerber,More likly to be Capture of State coffers @Riaan DW. The people spoke with there votes and the poor just keep on struggling thats why the ANC need there votes. They can't afford what working poeple have ie. wifi etc. so they don't get the info of whats going on in gov I don't think so. Coalition is prob the only way out sending ANC off to jail will take another 5/10 years mmmmmmm You can't win if you have recordings. In the case I mentioned everything on camera The Lawyer looks like Seal's. take away the hair and glasses reminds me of Seal WAR (What About Redeployment) Room

Always great to see ya @Riaan DW (or rather read you 😅) The more I watch this commission the more I realize how pointless it is withoit consequences and a follow-up prosecution... I'd choose almost anything other than Net-useless-flix But I feel like we're stuck in an endless cycle that'll never end but is costing lots of money... @Thobani I see... 😅 @Thabe... That'll just give him all the time to come up with excuses "Oh boy... the cycle just keeps turning... and we're all stuck in it... every day's the same old thing But at least it's better than Netflix... Tsotsi's gonna hit us with all the excuses he'll come up with tonight... he won't sleep...
Refiloe Nkabinde,most repeated words in this commission is...... I don't recall. they don't even use a different phrase they learned from the best Zuma I can't recall I can't remember everything it's a long time ago
