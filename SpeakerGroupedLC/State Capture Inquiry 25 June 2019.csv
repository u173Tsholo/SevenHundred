Peet Venter,ZUMA is coming! More? Ek dog dis eers in Julie? Chairman is correct. It is frustrating that the evidence leader dies not allow the witness to tell the story behind the facts and only reference the facts when necessary. This is better...
Anne M.,"But at this stage we don't know if he will actually testify. According to his lawyers Hello Jayden "@Derek Main Yes @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Why? Will he be distracted? @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU ðŸ˜‚ Maybe Ms September should sit next to Pretorius / Maleka while they ask the questions? @Jayden Bango The advocates I am referring to are senior counsel who have been excellent in this commission @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I think she will be intimidated by JZ. "Ms Hofmeyr and a couple of others "@Yolo More If you are correct "DCJ said in March 2018 ""Advocates and attorneys will be brought onto the legal team as the investigation requires""" "@cassim suleman Some of the banks ""hands"" aren't clean." @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I don't think Norman is a Zuma appointee - didn't DCJ selected the advocates he wanted on the commission. @Mulunghisi Mulunghisi Vaughn - SAA Head of Fuel Management @Mulunghisi Mulunghisi Do you have earphones? Sound is okay on my PC. Bye. Until tomorrow.
Jayden Bango,hello and welcome guys @Abel am with you on that one Zondo just wants this Adv to wrap up Zondo has more questions for Adv than the witness loooooooool how can he work up when he is confronted with a sleeping tablet this early but is that fuel for the whole Tambo fleet or just for two in question....this is not clear she must be able to stand on her own feet the commission does not want to waste resources morning michael "the whole thing is flat Zuma carries too much baggage his cross exam requires mmore than a week "IMHO "Zuma is a spent force we better not have this advocate again after tea please @Norman Zwane the biggest legacy amongst all predecessors will be corruption.Never in the history of SA has an economy be so wrecked by one individual's blessings this is one of the best lawyers @Siyabonga Kundayi you didnt miss much. u have just joined the right time lo lol sdhe argues well her mental faculties are well chiselled I couldnt have put it better Norman Buthelezi performance is quite dismal to say the least The top guns are busy elswehere across the country and the continent loooooool i think zuma can present a better defense than the lousy Jimmy you are right about delegation Parker @Anne M. I dont thinik so. they must be restricted to lower courts and processes until they can get their act together we cant manage to waiste taxpayer money. this commission is already behind trime looooooooool "this is the most important commission in recent history sorry to dissappoint but JZ aint gonna come here @Yolo More thanks for appreciating my point too...this is not about being too harsh on them remember the focus is on aviation @cassim suleman kalandra aviation link was that lady's company at mafikeng airport https://www.sastatecapture.org.za/site/about/legalteam @Jordan Strudwick I believe this guy is some fuel management expert at SAA welcome back guys how was lunch what does speaking over someone whoi has not finished show. yesterday we had a lot of it from Viljoen who constatntly distracted the judge its your lazy engineers again @DJ DJ dream on. aint gonna hapoen bye bye guys. it wasnt much fun today
sanele songelwa,hola guys another dae of shocking news.. lolololo even the SONA debate is better than these two.. its like shes not sure of what she is reading..
Granny Mokwena,another day of exposure of blatant theft
Mduduzi Thabede,ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ True That debate is a boring exercise From there You may cross examine but you must have submitted your own version in the form of an affidavit ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ Absolutely
makhosi nobhatyi,I am going to listen to parliament #sona debate Zuma is wasting our time "@ Born free yes he trying to sabotage commission as if he is corporate where he seems escaping "@ Domini Przybylski the old he still thinks he is a president or he will be a president in near future
Derek Main,@Anne M. I thought the rule that has been applied thus far is that you cannot cross-examine witnesses until you have testified yourself. @Granny Mokwena #ProudlyBroughtToYouByTheANC @Mduduzi Thabede Aaah OK - thanks. @Mduduzi Thabede It's going to have to be a very long affidavit.
Knowledge Machira,this debate is boring
Felix Muyoba,very very boring..
Toibo wa Toibo Antimba,Zondo must wake up
Diana Sekatane,"the Nigerian President is reserving jobs for them at home @wild the aircraft landed at Lanseria if not mistaken. oh yes you are right patience when you punch the body the head will eventually give in. "what about that German company on the arms deal. Corruption cuts across most countries even in Europe Zuma has to appear because the buck stopped with him as the person accounting to the voters. By the way he took an oath.
Wildthing,where did the Guptas.park there airplane and where did it get refilled. The plane they used for business that was grounded by the Canadian company. it was used by Zuma and others to travel to Dubai. but guess Lanseria was a better located site. but was fuel diverted He is a Judge and you respect him for that Role wow ha ha They should have rather had a knowledge base training. where the people with the correct skills teach others and transfer the knowledge over time. dont just remove and replace
Robert Russell,It got chased to OR @Michael Wild "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU .... read the old testament.... """"Eye for a eye"""" call me what you like." Always the VICTIM @Nelson Musoliwa Yip JZ and DD on the same Poisoning bullshit story.... @Dominic Przybylski You have to put Maleka into the mix..... The sad thing is that we are going to pay for his legal council in this commission for this commission he is..... the Presidency confirmed this on Monday He should be charged with TREASON @Dominic Przybylski ..... no writing is a ANC tactic... taught to them by the Russians Exactly my point.... bye Anne
KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Robert Russell People will say you're xeno... "@Robert Russell But i always found it hypocritical when any citizens complain about Nigerians on drugs "@Hermiomie Asreal Thats her name "Oops "Tough this one @Norman Zwane Zuma must be examined by Ms September @Anne M. He will keep on licking his lips and trap himself "@Norman Zwane Very sharp jeez. I am sure those she dealt with yesterday and before @Anne M. LOL...WHY not Ms September? "@Anne M. wHO's this one? She is sharp! Its boring Boeta @cassim suleman this one's name is Hofmeyer? She is sharp! Thanks for name. "@cassim suleman  @Ashne Hesselberg Maleka perhaps on leave and attending into his own business? Its unlikely Maleka will be here again after this long absence.... i suspect. Pretorious might be the one! @Anne M. Oh i assumed but one never knows Hofmeyer was biting hard the money launders yesterday @Anne M. "@Yolo More Can't find Hofmeyer on that website... Only Maleka @Norman Zwane LOL "Thing is @Anne M. Makes sense Anne. Those are temp additional adv to support the permanent "@Norman Zwane Gcabashe is an old croc with many tricks "@Owen Nyilika ""We're prepared "@Anne M. Eff complained last year that Norman was a Zuma appointee in the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) "@ann So
Hermiomie Asreal,"to my knowledge I wonder whose job it is to prepare all this paperwork... I saw an EWN report this morning saying he was heeding the call to appear at the commision "He needs to face reality "He really is not worth dying for Why are they rising though...it's not a courtroom Jayden you just like Adv. Hofmeyer "Yeah I only know her as Advocate Hofmeyr Maybe your favs will be back when Zuma appears "I think your criticisms are too harsh
hilton modike,ya neh
Nelson Musoliwa,Zuma's lawyers are accusing the Zondo comm of impartiality a grave concern according to me and is vague on whether he will appear on the set dates before the comm Interesting to see how the Zondo cmm will respond to Zuma's letter on how he view the comm among others that the comm is prejudiced against him. Jayden you are right a week is not enough Zuma always play smart with law crying victim hood What is the correct position in whether AA and BBBEE increased job creation than decreasing job creation? So AA and BEE is a failure and who then is responsible
Joseph Gumede,"waits of time no one will be arrestesd at the end
Romano Sparks,Too much
Slindile Ngcobo,"""I will kill for Zuma"""
Reinette Raubenheimer,s0 much respect for DCJ ZONDO
Norman Zwane,"@Jayden Bango Zuma was a whirlwind that left our defences all flattened out @Jayden Bango We are so fractured we cannot even see a crook on two legs. Yesterday we still had bus loads of Zandile Gumede supporters just as we had taxi loads of Magashule s@Jayden Bango All these are people who cannot exposure of their leadership or fools who are hungry to be bought for whatever purpose. That is what I guess the zuma years left us with. "Is it my ignorance or something @Jayden Bango Next Zuma and Jimmy Manyi will insist they will give evidence if only cross examined by Ms Buthelezi. @Mr Jones Parker Why is Pretorius not in the house? Zuma got off the rape rap coz poor prosecution and I have nightmares of a repeat. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Present counsel is like Tabasco - very sharp bite in small doses @Mr Jones Parker Very comforting thought indeed. "I find the use of the word ""SYMPATHY"" in this context very patronizing." "@Anne M. when ""Black empowerment"" started in the late 70's the ""sit by Louisa"" kind of training was used. It did not wark for me coz it was the first time I sat next to a white female." "@Anne M. It was either me smelling her intoxicaring perfume "@Zanele Dayile Maleka is like a WASABI @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Most Zebras have that toothy smile of a crocodile as the last view before they get eaten. @Lorna Kavanagh Jimmy Manyi cried like a babe in arms even before the 1st question from Adv. Maleka. He was terrified my that 'GOTCHA' smile on Adv. Maleka's face. @Lorna Kavanagh I think Zuma would wet his Mshini wam
Dan Brown,"Zuma won't testify
Lesiba Rabalao,haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa wake up haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Satyabrata Sahoo,jai sri ram..
Siyabonga Kundayi,Sorry i am late guys... coming from parliament Woza Mark Vhaun... your name sound corrupt
goldrick mafologela,South Africa in the making........
Mr Jones Parker,"@Norman Zwane  @Norman Zwane I think he is busy preparing or something. But he is definitely the team leader. He is probably the one delegating who is to question who. "@Norman Zwane  Thanx @Jayden Bango
Ashne Hesselberg,I pray that Maleka is the evidence leader for Zuma. Heâ€™s brilliant .
cassim suleman,hofmeyr and maleka the impressive ones this is hofmeyr but she slipped up yesterday..she did not implicate the banks and sbv for defaulting on fica duties kalandra viljoen...money laundering ..500m a month Jayden Bango..all implicated are informed to defend themself Anne M.full time or part time..glaring that banks and sbv were in her definition of enablers Anne M ..yes in this case bank manager did not need to be a rocket genius. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€cut and paste
Thembelani,I haven't seen the commissions bae in a while... ðŸ¤”think her name is Refileo or something
Yolo More,"I said it before that they can't throw interns to our faces. This is a big stage "No Anne M "The original Advocates are: Pretorius I am sure it is because those are the only ones who were with DCJ on his first press conference. Someone says the Vaughan sounds crook(rish). Let me leave for Sona Debate for now.
Zanele Dayile,Me too Maleka is perfect for asking Butternut head
Lorna Kavanagh,i would like to see Adv Maleka tale on Zuma.
danie schoeman,Gerrie Nel vsButternut headðŸ˜‚
SuperWadeheat3,Thank you very nice. ðŸ˜‚
J C,What is going on here?
Mpho Ledwaba,"Zuma told high school students that there is no state capture
Owen Nyilika,He is coming in July to tell us there is no state capture in South Africa "We a Here Because of Mr MALEMA
Michael Michael,Owen correct
Cyril Nyiko,Owen nyikila I think you left out the millions of South African who voted him to power.
Dams daily motivations Madamalala,Zuma is a Coward to all ordinary Blacks
Dominic Przybylski,Empowerment (regardless of race) is based on individual effort. i.e. self-empowerment. Anything else is a farce and an open invitation to corruption. "I spoke to Exon executive in apartheid days and asked why he wasn't doing business in SA. His answer was that in rest of Africa they could do what they like if they pay bribes "Is all part of becoming a standard African country where corruption rules - ""decolonisation""" I was friendly with a PAC member just after they were unbanned. He had a whole lot of Nigerian friends who became directors in all the big companies based on BEE. Local blacks were too slow. Perspective of morality is very different between Europe and Africa. European morality is based on merit. African morality based on benifitting family/tribe/race ahead of merit. @DJ DJ He'll find a way to avoid it. Sudden illness is my guess. Oath means nothing to JZ "If he does appear I expect him to refuse to answer questions We paying pension for him and his 5 wives at nearly same amount as when he was president. Is why he eventually gave up presidency. Alternative was impeachment where he would lose his pension and continuing perks. Not sure @Born free. Depends if/what he is found guilty of. Guptas taught him and Dudu Myeni how to hide evidence by never putting anything in writing. He was trained by KGB Yup all in ANC indoctrinated by USSR
Magda Seguin,"800 million litres of fuel per annum instead of the normal 442 000 per annum was used and there was no procurement Remember the Guptas had a plane...but I'm speculating Estelle Loocks testimony was different "Something fishy going on here Dominic it is the same with pharma companies African governments do not put experts in their fields in governments hence you see eg Mbaks going from sport to transport "Having worked with government bodies in SA Mboweni put checks and saving measures for the municipalities in place now they are complaining that they cant use consultants.They dont do the work they are employed for.
Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,whose this guy where he is working position of the guy it is my phone have a problem of the sound @anne yes maybe network
MD Matsetela,v4
Mike Meyer,capitalism sucks neo colonialism! DP...you certainly have no idea what you are on about.
Born free,Africa is a lawless contintent. Zuma is key to this commission of enquiry. He will be supeoned should he not volunteer to appear. The evidence leader must be Mr Pretoria or Ms Hoffmeyer . Pretorius Zuma wanted the questions so he could learn to answer in parrot fashion I can't wait to see Zuma sweat ðŸ˜… Surely if Zuma is found guilty in a court of law all his perks will fall away?? Can Zuma write???
Fred Botha,They use voice typing @Jayden Bango
Lee D. Hendrix,"..Denel SOC/ Weapons Ind. is a pivotal for turnaround funds "... Zuma... President of the Corporation of Countries/ States
Bongani Sondlo,who is this guy..? did he ask not to be shown on camera..? Bye bye..
DJ DJ,Lol guys. He does make me laugh requesting questions prior to coming to inquiry allready his laywers are saying that this commission is design to make him look bad
Dabble Smith,"Hello friends
Kevin Simon,Exactly the point Dominic. And he can't get by on that. RSA economy almost as damaged as those countries at war. Horrific.
Stacey-Lee Marshall,Wow I wish my day at work ended whenever
