Terence,can we maintain the land? "the white farmers are doing an amazing job "I'm not racist no title deeds? so why give land lol @unathi I am asking a question not making a statement. if u not literate in the English language then refrain from making judgements "I don't know farming "bullshit dude... I know it's about land @bushula my question is based on people wanting land but can they financially sustain the land they want "@dave I agree 100% "@bushula u touched a nerve by judgements "@dave that's the sad thing "@bushula I never once said it was only agriculture "@mike u right "khoisan owned land in Western Cape "@mike "I'm agreeing a bit with @zizoh "@zizoh in cape Town whites kicked coloureds out there houses can someone define black people? "@davidjacobs "@wonga don't talk to me about Bible @johndoe I'm a with u there lol "@wonga exactly... it doesn't at all... so that's why I'm asking everyone is saying the land belongs to black people... now can someone tell me who the black people are @johndoe lol brilliant answer an 80 year old Khosa mama told me that black people in Eastern Cape originated from upper Africa and moved down cause of wars. do u agree or disagree? "lol @johndoe speak for yourself lol I don't have a dark heart "@siyabonga... I didn't make this up. I asked a random lady at a restaurant and that was her story. are u disagreeing? and if so "@bushula how can u tell me what I don't want to hear lol if u knew me ud realise I am open to any topic so why is it tuff for black Africans to accept there heritage comes from Upper Africa. does anyone have evidence that black South Africans originated from South Africa? I'm asking "@bushula I agree with u "if u discovered the land "can someone answer my question???? if you founded the land

MY DNA CHOICES.,Guptas aren’t even South Africans! Such support from the ANC!
Mkhululi Bushula,@Terence Tito u have been fed this poison that the land is all about agriculture and u swallowed it. @Terence Tito it seems I have touched the nerve judging by your explosion with such a slight provocation. @Terence Tito I reiterate my statement the land is not all about agriculture since u are so much educated to u have a survey of how much land is used for agriculture. He is reading a letter from Nazim Howa. @Poegenpool if the land why u refuse to release it. @Zizoh don't worry the decision has been taken the land will taken whether they like it or not. @Pastoolio the way u stole it. @John Doe point of correction Khoi ppl are black and African and there was no South Africa before the Berlin Conference that created borders. The are trying so hard to destort history. A decision about land has already been taken I know to others they still don't want to accept it they think it's just a bad dream Black ppl is someone like me and we know we are. @Terence Tito she was telling u that black ppl are coming from the same africa that we live in but u did not want to hear that @Terence Tito it's bcs Africa was one with no boundaries. @Yose Human I don't what agenda u pushing but we will not be distracted by your stupidity.

Wildthing,"the Afrikaans language was created in SA Afrikaans is not people but a spoken Language. It is made up of many diffrent groups which includes Blacks Zingzong I have fokal land to share I rent no it did not learn history. Jan is from Holland. they speak Dutch. Afrikaans was created in SA to unit the people going up into Africa that did not want to be under the English rule in the Cape. Zizoh send me your address I will send you a box of sand thats the only land I have. It was not whites but explorer's. just like the Africans from the north that came downnbtand chased the khoi to the Cape. Rifa we came back to the place where our great great great grandparents came from. The cradle of mankind. And that is history. proving the ANC lied wrong NP idiots joined ANC after 1994 Zizoh = D Zuma I want a BMW. I want a Merc.

Mzekezeke is the most high @Sfiso if land belongs to everyone; go to Europe and say that nonsense. The African LAND is for Africans @ John Its hilarious because u want us to come here n entertain ur lies. the National PArty will be proud of u bcs u seek to promote their agenda. We are taking the LAND finish and klaar DA is not for me @John How can the be peace if ur don't see a need to share the LAND? @John Doe so why u come here n talk on behalf of ppl who owns land? We want land n u must actually join then "@John. Okay if we have that as a common ground then
John Doe,The Khoi DEMAND their land back from EVERYBODY GIVE THE LAND BACK THE KHOI DO NT ACCEPT YOU LAND THIEVES HOW DARE you appropriate the Khoi The khoi are the only true landowners everybody else is a thief @Phoka Mofokeng just stating the truth EXACTLY scrap all borders make all land communal dismantle all capitalist structures I have keys to my apartment is anybody wants ? you just have to pay my rent though @DAVE EAST Ya she's ugly anyways I only have an apartment that I have to pay rent for. But if I could own land for free that would be great please I ALSO WANT THE LAND @Nkanyiso Mathamba isn't he dead ? just asking ... I wouldn't know I want a piece of land in Clifton preferably on the beach front VIVA CLIFTON LAND VIVA @Terence Tito Have to use the pencil test otherwise no official test race is a social contract I've studied race haha this comment section is hilarious the National Party would be proud of how divided everybody is Keep it up folks RACIST !!! TO hate each other the deep dark parts of all our racist souls are exposed for all to see on this YouTube comment section. The human heart is dark ... and also we want LAND preferably in Clifton True ... metaphor haha but we can be literal too @Phoka Mofokeng Ya .... I don't really haha NA is long gone fam its just us hating each other now @mncedisi ncokazi actually it is not. The NP was firmly absorbed into the ANC and then later integrated into the DP - which then subsequently changed its name to the DA. The DA used to be a liberal party called the DP - but has since lost much of its liberal position in order to attract a greater following across the whole country. @mncedisi ncokazi ... Yes but only partly. The DA is not technically the NP. It just merely incorporated members of the NNP (New National Party) after the ANC had done the exact same thing. @mncedisi ncokazi So the DA is not technically the same as the NP (which was actually the NNP under Marthinus van Schalkwyk). @mncedisi ncokazi There is a fair difference between this and saying that the DA is the NP (in a literal sense) @Nkanyiso Mathamba WHOSE GRAVE ? @mncedisi ncokazi Well they factually do not have the same policies "@mncedisi ncokazi one party (NP) had a policy of systematic racial relegation and oppression @mncedisi ncokazi now you might validly be able to criticise the DA's free market policies of perpetuating existing privilege within the market - but to equate this with the Apartheid is a misnomer @Zizoh who is they ? @Zizoh But I don't harper for the times of Apartheid @Zizoh I actually abhor the systematic oppression rendered by the National Party upon the majority black population of South Africa I wish for everybody to exist in peace and be able to pursue their happiness however they see fit so long as no harm is rendered upon those around you @Zizoh Should I give you my money ? please provide bank details I don't have much though @Zizoh I unfortunately do not own any land Just a small apartment I rent @Phoka Mofokeng I believe in sharing the land @Phoka Mofokeng I'd like some land for myself to be honest preferably in clifton but I will also accept Camps Bay @Phoka Mofokeng I don't talk on behalf of anyone haha I just think everybody needs to take a chill pill @mncedisi ncokazi I have no counterparts and was born into this horror show of a country which I had nothing to do with creating
