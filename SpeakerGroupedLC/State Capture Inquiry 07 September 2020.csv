He asked how many months have 28 days 2nd Name 🤣 "But if you use whatsapp
Douglas Masuku,Matona former Eskom CEO they is referring to Eskom board I agree. Notshe also looked wobbly in the beginning but rose to be a star. Seleke is just acclamatizing

Nondumiso Soko,the advocate sounds white 💀 the Eff should be directing the same energy to looters where is he working now? they didn't give you a choice because they told you not to come back tomorrow
Waterbearer,"Can’t wait to hear how Guptas removed competent black top executives at Eskom to pave the way for Brian Molefe The Chair is like this for new evidence leaders. I noticed him even with Adv Notshe @CanisAfricanis I agree Give the guy a chance. It’s the first time he is leading evidence at the Commission - pretty much like his first day on the job Lynne Brown
Sibusiso Nkosi,Whose this model c old men🤔🤔🤔

Tommygun,"who were ""They""?" @Salome Seabi 🙂 sounds like e was kicked for not being a team player? @Tebogo Sibilanga So right... its this dream we are sold of conspicuous consumption that poor and ill educated will do anything to atain. Ppl gotta realise you can only drive 1 car at a time and live in 1 house. We are sold greed. @MULISA NKUNA what you say if the stylist for the shoot or ad co was black? "I was traumatised having no hair Thieves on the board constructed a sub board withthemselves as arbitors of right and wrong? Who were/are the law firm representing Eskom at the time? or advised to reinstate Everyone was too scared to mention his B.O. and so instituted trumped up legal charges to remove him. it was completely personal @Albert Noah its automated transcription.... ..butter pocorn in microwave...
FREEworld,greetings from west papua black culottes curly we are family✊✊ greetings from west papua black culottes curly we are family
Norman Krakra,"Tsotsi....you can imagine

Vuyisile Sovendle,This guy knows something you can tell by his voice its not consistent
Sakhile Mbokane,Yes yes yes "Let's give the Advocate time  Your future? @a b c No question Please expain 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Joshua Borias,"""ESKOM - WHERE 'STATE CAPTURE' GERMINATED.""" """ WE SHALL LEARN HOW OPTIMUM COAL WAS SUFFOCATED IN FAVOUR OF TEGETA.""" """ GREAT PURGE OF EXCELLENCE
Xolani Nhleko,the chair doesn't have faith for the evidence leader i guess... i don't knw his name loool agree lool i wonder if he still has that money too weak nobody says the anc own anybody I'm still gona cast my vote for the anc for the last time if they don't change "no lol yeah i guess so
Thobani Mkananda,@Rodney Nxumalo 😂😅😂🤣 *ORDER!* Who is this evidence leader? "@Wesley stop confusing me. Where do individuals start and end
Molao Peter,chairperson only wants charity "Kate
Tebogo Sibilanga,Evidence leader looks like the late Steve Tshwete "The only way this country is ever going to prosper is when the ANC government has been removed. Otherwise We have poor quality opposition parties which do not really give the ANC any sleepless nights. And the mushrooming of new political parties is not helping either. Divide and rule strategy works for the ANC I personally have no faith in these endless commissions of inquiries. How many were held before? What happened to the implicated? Evidence of corruption are buried in these commissions. "Unfortunately we still have people who votes the ANC because they ""ended"" apartheid. I don't owe them any favour Zondo loves his JOKO tea The fish rots from the head. The whole organisation is paralyzed with corruption People come to these commissions and lie under oath knowing very well that nothing`s going to happen to them. Why then would one have faith in this very expensive circus? Which one`s are useful Lebza? Zondo is rushing to the microwave
Sandra Smith,The guptas had lots of help
Phillip Cwazibe,@Xolani Nhleko he skips critical details. Minister not mentioned by name and neither the then president of the country. @ Salome Seabi ​ sadly so.
Connie Mose,I am missing Kate dealing with swissport Ndzeku "I don't know I read article written by Khaya Sithole regarding bizarre testimony by Ndzeku it's a jaw dropper
dada ngova,liar "@Kariba "@ Tebugo that is not true..WNC was effective in the struggle ANC I meant to say Well you will learn when you visit your library..put any party in power there will always be bad ones "@ Kariba I disagree It's going to be bad before it gets better..that's the continent's style "@ Kariba the King's bad boy jumps into other countries to kill his adversaries I live in a so called first world country and they fight over corruption all the time..no sort of zondo commission to display such cases
Rakatsinyane Tsolo,"zuma was behind all forms of corruption in the country
Ashne Hesselberg,"@Angelo Doubel at first I was worried that he would not be up to the task
Linda James,Ben Ngubane...... there's it exactly @ sophie demmings what an unfortunate name... Mr Tsotsi🙈🙈 Was Gigaba the Minister?
sophie demmings,the usual suspects..
Wesley M,"Zuma was not behind all corruption in SA "our problem is not Zuma "Even Cyril will not get rid of corruption Tebogo Sibilanga I agree with you my vote is going to Herman Mashaba the ANC as an organisation is corrupt. "for the health and safety of South Africa "vote for whoever you want Andre Ackerman only the word of the Lord shall stand forever!!! "the ANC has delivered us from the yoke of apartheid
Koketso Tlhabi,Ke Tsotsi Romeo Khumalo
Thabo Mokoaleli,This Board removed CEO Matona because he was going to be an instruction 🤣😂🤷 Gigaba must be called again because is highly implicated. "ANC must clean up "The word of Lord never helped us for about 4 decades. Why should we rely to him. We freed ourselves We should not let our country to go Zimbabwean way. Not in this South Africa. My parents and my family suffered under the previous regime and I had to stand up to fight for our Freedom. But I won't let ANC to be captured by clear rascals.
Brinco Barasta,@linda 😂😂😂😂
Thami Ngwenya,ANC replaced by who? Mashaba is bringing what?
Kariba Moetanalo,My vote is getting closer and closer to Herman Mashaba... The ANC might have a chance if they could send all of their cabinet to prison and replace them with young Professionals. Its useless to have great policies for showcasing when they are not actioned. ANC has failed us all and it will continue to fail to to an even worse degree than Zimbabwe. @dada ngova : corruption exists globally with a certain limitations. The ANC grabs the whole meal from your table and then continues to force their filthy hands down your throat to extract everything. Bring bad the DEATH PENALTY. Hang every ANC fraud star like yesterday... "@dada ngova : i am based in Saudi Arabia and anyone found guilty of such crimes
madzi Kuse,"""she"" the minister
Rita,Zuma was the beginning of the ANCs corruption I totally agree @tgebogo if all the guilty parties were to be called before the Zondo commission it would cost us tax payers a fortune as it would never end @ramonyana ..never exactly @theo @xolani why... you giving them the licence to continue with their corruption yes we can vote whoever we choose ....so let's keep voting for the thieves and don't complain. I complain bos its my tax they stealing yes James made us aware of more looting than we anticipated katiba...ANC will never do that bcos they will all be in orange uniforms yes your vote can visibly bring you misery too exactly..the commissions are a form of payment to comrades too? too many commissions no outcomes Gerhard if it was u or I that's what would have been done the ones who will continue to vote for the Anc have faith in them unfortunately oh Musa how naive you are...such a pity. how much more proof do you want musa how do you feel when a child drowns in a pit toilet. how do you feel when you see people living in 3x3 shacks with bricks holding down bin bags to keep out the rain. corruption musa!!!!!! "musa and you still defend the ""snake"" who wanted his day in court but is never available to appear. I smell a rat ..in the ANC talking very cheap" grace you 100% correct they have mansions in the rural areas and live in squalor here for the world to see.
Theo van Zijl,The Prez should have acted earlier on fraud to maintain credibility. He has however treated the whole State capture like a fart and hoped it would go away. Alas . .it will hang around for a long time "Molefe Since 200 = 16 Commission of Inquiry. No person is wearing Orange Overalls Since 2001 = 16 Commission of Inquiry. No person is wearing Orange Overalls This is not going forward.
Lorna Kavanagh,Molefe Singh and Koko need to be brought in front of the commission.
Wildthing,waste if money. Koko and gang must go straight to court.
Ramonyane mosia,what worries most people is when this corrupt people will bring the money back thiz commission is only wasting.lot of money
Penny Jane,So true Thami Ngwenya by who nyani🤔🤔 Really Carmen

Michael Lester,PS5 price please PS5 > RTX3090
Phakamile Khuzwayo,we need to suspend Anc maybe for 2decades for the sake of our grandchildren
Nthabiseng Morabe,All departments are excelling with corruption . We should punish ANC and teach them a lesson. Show them as we made them we will also destroy them. Theres NO # TILL JESUS COMES *** As they claim ...
alan lesley,"PS5 SUCKS

lizzietitana,Rita this is a free country you can vote whoever you are comfortable with. it's your choice go and vote for your own choice that will free you from your misery. your vote counts
Ndaxola Mdrai,this commission is not going to finish in time
James Godloza Godloza,i might be wrong but the commission is very informative yet useless i had seen my father full of blood beaten by white bosses of that time and i have seen him rejoice under the first democratic president unfortunately he did not leave long enough to see this
Trevor bee Botes,you right
Gerard Victor,"This is trial enough and throw them all in jail. seize assets Just jail the lot and save the taxpayer a lot of money. Thanks to JZ and his crew and the trillions stolen blatantly everyone involved needs a new Orange Jumpsuit care of the South African Public . He sold the country but putting uneducated corrupt people in positions of power who cared for nothing but greed. He was Pres so swindled his thieves in and took big back hands. Head of the snake! jail Jan van Riebeecks fault with his long flowing curly locks. The CEO of CLICKS Too much PPE theft-masks were stolen upon entering
Lebohang Mofokeng,Tebogo you assertion is very correct ANC thinks that they made us a favour...... "The president cant waste taxes payers money Jacob Zuma and his friends sold our country to the highest BIDDER and they dont care as a long as their families thrive @ the expense of the country. this is unfair H A L O two useless organisations Tebza none ....this country is doomed Musa he acted dumb to the Guptas bra. Musa what do you think ....why were we worse during his tenure???? his choice of civil servants in the strategic SA public sector companies. The aim was to destroy this country Anele Mkwekwe indeed I dont care what Musa he sold us sinjenje due to his wrong choices Effective Civil servants were frustrated and repressed to leave their employment people suffered because they did not acceed to corrupt Rita Scalone yes indeed that man is a slow learner he is short sighted I mean JZ....he just says things for sake of saying them .. day in court the day is granted/// he wants want to appear. confused You are imagining things...at the he will alone compiling the report and coming with recommendations/ he avoids confusion Bulali you are correct Judge Zondo has his system that he would the legal people to follow in complying information and naming it...for his sake

Mandla J Ngubeni,I commend EEF for this one 👏👏
Cerebis,I agree....stick to the subject at hand....corruption. The EFF is looking for side shows to hide their VBS Looting. Bring them here and get Adv Kate Hofmeyer onto them.

Thanks @Ms G Now we know where this is going..... This is important. They wanted him gone!!! Exactly @ Thomas Cleghorn Eskom had taxpayers money with which to pay for their dirty deals @Immanuel It is him indeed Clearly they wanted him out. Nothing was to stand in the way of the Guptas. Dr Ben Ngubane big Gupta enabler. "@Immanuel So many Gupta enablers out there. Some played the role wittingly Hehehe @Immanuel "Of course something happened. There was a meeting with Zuma Hehehe @Thomas Cleghorn Enter Brian Molefe!!!!!! @Lady T. Not too much. We have moved very slowly in understanding why our witness had to be removed from Eskom. It was clear that he did not fit in with their plans. They got rid of him by paying him @Elton Josea the evidence leader is pedantic but he is getting there He had to go to pave the way for Molefe to enter and do the dirty
