Nakrito Nakrito,Jimvarro in the building Hot seat 😂 So much nonsensical stuff from Harvard alumni 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yolo More,The one and the only ATM master. Lying is his middle name. There you go. Complaining as usual. Hehehehehehe. Drama queen of note. This crook is buying time. Kate Hofmeyr is waiting for you patiently. Your lies dont shake her. Shut up bloody crook! "You are subpoenaed fondini Themba Maseko did not know all the documents. Chair you need to have balls on this fool. Dont let him off the hook otherwise the commission will be a playground of the thieves. Thando Nkutha he wants to be treated with kid's gloves. Typical Zuma cabal. Yes. He did the same with Adv Maleka. Bloody liar! Look at him with ATM shirt. Wait for the questions Jimmy marn. "Lex Luger Why let him waste our time? "Thando Nkutha Hofmeyr must start mr chair. "You see chair Mandisi Ntauzana yes he refused. His refusal letter was mentioned. No chair. "Lex Luger Kate is warming up now. Bathathe Advocate Kate! Hahahahahaha Yho! Chair you are wasting our time and data with Jimmy. Wait for the questions. We want answers not discussions. DCJ you are too soft for my liking. This Ntauzana must be blocked. Yho! DCJ! "Funicanz DCJ do you think Jimmy is listening to you or he cares? A ruling please chair. Manyi wont respond to questions asked. Hofmeyr take your bags and leave this nonsonso. You go girl! makhosi nobhatyi I dont think so. Gcabashe is sharp too. I am sure he wants Mr Mokoena. "mandisi ntauzana """Chair "Born free Lies "DCJ please were you charged or not? "Tholithemba Ntsele do you call this ""clever""?" "He lied and said he was never charged PEACE PEOPLE I didnt know that Mr Mdladlana is still alive. Hahaha you are easy because you wasted 2 hours of our time. "Dominic Lies have short legs. "Academic Editors sensitive matter The Norwegian ambassador must come and sing. You bribed him bloody crook You bribed her and you failed. Hahahaha Word for word adv Kata Kate Looks like the chair respects Manyi too much. Who Thando Nkutha? "Thando Nkutha He wont recall everything from now on. Hahahahahahahaha What was Manyi's stunt all about because now he is responding nicely to the questions. "Hahaha He was lying Jimmy is not sleeping tonight Dylan Jacklin no. Her reports were not challenged so they speak for her. 2 hours for Manyi.
Pastor J.J,@Jane .Blamire Yes. He already lied. I noticed that toooo.....hehehehehehe Here we go again. Same fool. Same story. Same like JZ "@Thando Nkutha ...When she says ""he is factually incorrect"" she means "" he is bloody blatant liar"" @Lex Luger" @mandisi ntauzana What have they done wrong? @mandisi ntauzana There is no matter LRA or not that is Subjudice @Yolo More ... Maybe I am wrong but @mandisi ntauzana has not done anything wrong. He expessed his views like the rest of us. You did. @Born free ...and the other 57million tooooo @Yolo More . I apologise . I understand better now @mandisi ntauzana And we all knew that the shower thing was not going to work. @Tebogo Makoro ...sorrreeeee ma. I repeated what he told the entire nation. no offence intended. Make sure that your Pampers Nappies are on properly tightened Jimmy Boy. I can see the beeeeg one coming @Simon Davies . I ask respectfully and need to be enlightened. Apartheid laws changed 25 years ago but do you honestly believe that in practice that people who practised apartheid changed with the law I respect and accept that view @Simon Davies I have been with @Derek Main and many others on this chat since the start of the commission last year and I can say that Derek has never been a racist and will defend against it. @Thando Nkutha I did pray and continue to do so. I have also prayed for your naughteee roving eyes upon Young Kate. hahahahahaha Thank you @Norman Zwane . And offcourse you have also been on the chats since the beginning bro @Thando Nkutha And you will be blindfolded whilst she talks @Norman Zwane He is always in love when this girl is questioning. We had a fight about that Molefe girl as well. @Thando Nkutha .hahahahahahahaha @Dylan Jacklin Not yet but she has to at some stage to confirm the findings and any disputed subsequent evidence. It will make sense if she comes late in the process @Norman Zwane Yes. You are right. We had a crush on that one too until she fell asleep on the job. But then again both Thando and I are just old naughteee buggers The budget and period has already been extended by a Court Order with options to extend. It seems 3 years is probable and likely
nhlanhla nkosi,volume please Hoffman answer the question lol this guy
makhosi nobhatyi,Answer questions sir Jimmy knows everything You didn’t want to corporate sir please don’t lie Chair is patiently waiting for you Jimmy This man is a crook 😂😂😃😃@ Thando Nkutha Manyi is playing ngoku "Uyanya lo tata ngoku "He is shaking Miss Williams provide full response to your accusations Let us continue Ku lit apha @Mandisi ntauzana Manyi didn’t want to come to answer questions again so once commission find difficult left with no choice to subpoena him even Zuma we will do the same anyone infect Manyi ufuna miss Gcabashe Why must you given documentation Lies in defense of himself Manyi again lied I will read tonight 😂😃😃
Kevin Simon,Jimmy sounds unhappy! He also sounds a lot less confident that his usual blustery self. Jimmy is running hard. This is a lynchpin for him. Let's understand why it was rescinded! l Jimmy KNOWS he is in over his head. But we would also like to test Mildred's bone fides. Get on with it. Sthakathi Khumalo ​ Really?
Frans Phala,this guy is an advanced lair bottom line is that i am a lair. shut-up already he is going to make up stories and say he was ambushed "jimmy ""phunyuka"" manyi in the house" hahahaha Dominic easy lol yoh if lying was a person

Pansophical lighthouse,Go get him Kate! "ouh This is going to go ahead He's a full time crook and liar... He certainly seems to remember plenty now... "Hahaha It's going ahead folks! Anybody else noticing the GUPTA PUPPETS? Correct! @Thando Jimmy is staying today! "Anyone who thinks Manyi is clever is either paid to say so "Tholithemba I see you GUPTA'S PUPPET! I'll live where I like PUPPET! Cut their strings! 😁 Manyi is going to jail... "Apartheid ended 25 years ago Mr Manyi is guilty. Now that was easy... 😊 Bring a bucket and spade GUPTA PUPPET Yes most of them have Pastor. I refer you to the referendum that denounced the practise in 1992? They voted AGAINST apartheid "Thanks Pastor you appear to be a reasonable man Stop throwing tantrums and just admit your complicity in state capture. How much are they paying you to appear so stupid this afternoon? 😉 Our views??? So you've got accomplices here 😂😂😂 Nice admission! How is Dominic a racist? 👍Heather 😂😂😂
Pheladi Lamola,He will wish Adv Maleka was here. Jimmy is running scared. That's all. Jimmy probably thought he would get Adv Mokoena and he was ready to treat him the same way he treated Maleka. There's nothing unfair about the way Jimmy is being treated. Yes DCJ He sounds scared
Bernard Matolino,Is Manyi up to his tired trickery? @Yolo More Yeah why drag the ATM into this? @Pastor J I think Manyi is an attention seeker "@Yolo More I understand you perfectly. I referring to Manyi He knows his affidavit backwards. Hayibo!!! "@Yolo More I agree @James Godloza Godloza Thats what's irritating about him. He is here to remind us he still exists @Thando Nkutha I wont advise you to do that. He is a viper with 21 heads "Ohhh please Jimmy Bengimuthatha kacane losisi Adv. Uyashisa shame. @Thando Nkutha @Yolo More She is something else "I salute you Adv. You were brought up well Suddenly I dont miss Maleka anymore "Jimmy "In Jimmy's own head @Frans Phala bamubambile kajeno "Jimmy please @Dominic Przybylski 😂😂😂😂😂😂 @Born free Tell us about the T20 Super😂😂😂Now I am gonna roast your behind @James Godloza Godloza 😂😂😂😂😂why are you killing me @Pastor J 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I am easy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 No longer at ease I am worried about Pirates

funicanz,Has he been sworn in? "@Phillip Cwazibe  "@Thando Nkutha  "Thanks Chair. @Thando Nkutha  Ms Hofmeyer is not going to adjourn this hearing. It will go through. This time Manyi won't blame the how she's standing. She is present respectfully so let's begin. is the right one to lead him today. 😆😆 "We can hear all this when you are led in evidence "@Kay Kay  "@Born free  We want to know why... So let's begin.
Phillip Cwazibe,"@ funicanz ​Has he been sworn in? Yes @ funicanz he now realizes that he lied in the first hearing. @ Pheladi Lamola ​ It is hot. @ Mark Waner ​Does He is caught off guard. He thought the truth would come out. Phillip Cwazibe ​@ Mark Waner ​Does He is caught off guard. He thought the truth would not come out. Rumble in the jungle. @ Tumi Sereme ​Is this new studio for the commission. It is for today and tomorrow only.
James Godloza Godloza,inkukhu inqunywe umlomo wanya manyi @lex he thinks he is clever than everyone @thando lol my thoughts exactly he had just implied that the commission is unfair to him i still say wanya manyi "@mandisi as his opening remarks were ""what am I doing here as I have already testified in this commission"" he thought he had fooled everyone" @mandisi do you want this country to be rid of corruption? Adv Hofmeyr is just someone who really loves our country miss Hofmeyr dishonest aiaiaiai manyi uzonya mfana @yolo not soft but giving the man the longest rope to hang himself but we do need people like mandisi so we are constantly reminded of people who don't care about their country @mandisi for what reason should people be subpoenaed uManyi usanya nangoku
watson mutanga,He sounds both defensive and desperate. "He complained about Advocate Maleka
trezeguet,why are we at a different place now? what happened?
Eliot Chauke,Mr Manyi "I told you
mandisi ntauzana,Mr Manyi should have consulted Counsel He has a point but he is not putting it in a chronology and substantially.......... eish But was it necessary to subpoena Mr Manyi? did he refuse to come on request? The harshness of the way the commission is treating Mr Manyi smells of selective prosecution But we never heard anything from anyone to suggest that Mr Manyi refused to attend except for him arguing that the matter to be dealt with is LRA matter Why subpoena someone who believe that his presence should not be sought because the matter in dispute is a LRA matter........ commission should have pushed to convince him to provide affidavit but let's treat each other fairly "Makhosi did Mr Manyi miss any date to appear or refused to submit any documentation? come on let's be fair people "Lol Yolo Block me bro Time to start......... the commission must not subpoena people just for the sake of subpoena "Lol Dominic you killing me bro "failure to attend or action a legal instruction should be met with subpoena Adv Sikhakhane or Masuku would babe been of assistance here "Lol Dominic awume tu "Let's see facts don't exist then we don't fall into a predetermined view. Which request did he reject because even last Friday when the subpoena was issued there were correspondences........ so we don't have any reason to believe Manyi refused any lawful instruction "we wasted a lot of time because of this subpoena "Dominic "Fair from chair Mr Manyi is gonna answer the questions but commission must learn to be fsir Adv Hofmeyr is detailed and prepared in her approach........ I like her "Yolo please "Former President is old people "Lol Pastor hahahaha eish yall don't have chill Mr Manyi is a Harvard alumni charges were rescinded and therefore Manyi thought he was not charged Lol yes he got a certificate in Geology Economics or something like that Mr Manyi is easy NN2........... NN5.......... NN2........ Mr Manyi is gonna deal with this Heather why? he is just ventilating his views even if you disagree with them but opposing views will obviously be divisive Ok Derek I hear you Mr Manyi is dealing with thee questions correctly and I think he will come up tops and doesn't have anything to hide. Mr Manyi must call Adv Hofmeyr kahle not Hoffmann Should have started at 9am tomorrow
Khathutshelo Matlou,He wants to be crucified fairly.
Lizwe Ndungane,He has no place to hide the rest must follow All these guys must go and wear orange How much did u get from Saxon world "They must also call the fat guy who cried on TV
Person of interest,Ask him questions. He can come back for the ones he can't remember. "Dragged kicking and screaming mandisi go away I love you Ms Hofmeyr Speak Jimmy. Keep speaking. "Born free Zondo got the whole Manyi previous evidence in his head PLUS new evidence "Smile 🥵
Disemi Molta,"The way Manyi is nervous

DISGUSTING I TAKE MY HAT OFFFF FOR MISS HOFMEYER MR MONEY TAKER LIEGBEK LIEG BEK MR MONEY MR MONEY POLSMOOOOOR MR MONEY POLSMOOOOR IS CALLING YOU THE THRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE.

Dominic Przybylski,@mandisi ntauzana I assume a subpoena is only issued if the witness refuses a request. "Tholani Dlomo used excuse of being sick to explain why his employer couldn't find him for 6 months. Zuma also ""too sick"" to attend. Surely Manyi has a tame doctor to give hime a sick note." I want to hear Hofmeyr's response to the claim she's dishonest. @mandisi ntauzana I wont block you. Your perspective is interesting. I like trying to work out why people defend those who have impoverished our country. @mandisi ntauzana You obviously have inside information or disinformation. Which is it? and if no facts exist... then you create them? How do you know he did not reject a request from the commission? @mandisi ntauzana That answer only makes sense to a spin-doctor or politician. and you have inside information about the correspondence? agreed His response will aun to waste time until they give up. Truth is easy to remember. Lies on the other hand are tricky. I'm hoping that Zondo will make recommendation against cadre-deployment and the current version of BEE. Those are the root causes of corruption and incompetence. This lady is super-slick. "Zuma is practicing ""sick"" so that he can eventually get the same ""medical parole"" that the very healthy Schaik got." Zuma will carry on apealing and being sick until he dies of old age. Can you imagine that Zuma will not take case to appeal for years and years if he is found guilty on the 783 counts of fraud and racketeering? Zumas' wives will lose their luxury benefits if he is convicted. They may hope he dies before finally having his day in court. Spin doctors can fool the public but not so easy to fool a concourt judge. Over-populating is biggest problem for poor countries. They won't recover until they can stop making more babies than they can support. Can still get paid up till end of month if fired. Doesn't remember disciplinary hearing but does remember which lawyers he employed for the hearing? @Sthakathi Khumalo If land was stolen it was stolen when population was about 3 million so the extra new 50 million did not have their land 'stolen'. "@Sthakathi Khumalo After 25 years of ANC rule our country is bankrupt. Let's hope our politicians get advice from people who know how to run a country successfully @Sthakathi Khumalo That is our problem. State capture and our unions have no interest in productivity. We need Rassie Erasmus to come in as coach to the government. Teach them how to get our country to be a winner rather than the loser which the world is sadly watching. @Yolo More Please indicate what I have said which is racist. "@He lives in you Truth depends on your point of view. ""There are none so blind as those who will not see."""
Gill Oosthuizen,this lady is so sharp... queen of queens
Cyril Nyiko,"Jimmy thought this commission was going to be a walk over. First time he went there on his own accord

Kay Kay,he's always hostile Mr. Manyi doesn't want to be led in evidence I'm sorry to say this but Zondo does not need to be soft with Manyi bcos we won't move bcoz Jimmy won't allow adv Hofmeyer to ask him questions as she would want to "Zondo must make a ruling Ms Hofmeyer is always prepared to nail witness regardless how hostile or tougher they may be She's fine plz chair leave to her to grill this clown I smell bribery here he's now passing buck around I don't trust his answers on this issue So he indirectly disclose his conflict of interest and yet call the issue frilious.... Ms Hofmeyer is really sharp she caught Conflict of interest And he deem the report malicious.... 😂😂😂 "l like Ms Hofmeyer
Born free,Reveal the names labour related?? How was the rugby folks didn't I tell you we would win! playing the Victim 🤣🤣🤣yes the party is at my place The Guptas chose the ministers.. corrupt ministers Zondo putting words in his mouth.. wow a year ago. Democracy at its best The taxpayer is paying and we demand answers He was a played well speak up he is protecting names of relevance Go for his jugular Ms Hoffmeyer yes like his head.. very polished His head is perspiring.. nervous Just imagine Zuma the sweat would be pouring down the commission would have to provide buckets or Jo Jo's Zuma the artful dodger Zuma he has to service many wives he can not be sick The commission will have to ask Zuma'snany wives if he is too ill. Zondo putting words in his mouth again Haha yes.. Dominique.. very true well innocent until proven guilty India the most overpopulated and polluted country Precisely.. Dominique Clolonialism has nothing to do with this enquiry He did not get paid and then he was paid.. strange continue please uneasy is easy Zondo wants to go home Unions are South Africa's downfall.. there are other ways to support employees and their rights.. not these unions which make alot of money from their members6 when Africans can become independent and lead their countries into a prosperous Independent country and stop relying on European handouts.. then you have a right to Independence and prosperity. I am not racist just a realist.. Allow this witness to talk Hoffman 🤣🤣🤣 continue early please

I don't like associating with racists at all. "@Sthakathi Khumalo While I agree there are many issues that need to be addressed @Thando Nkutha I didn't say he was - I just think he was defending one. @Sthakathi Khumalo I try to be consistent but I choose my battles.

I haven't blocked him - I generally like seeing his point of view. @Pastor J Thanks Pastor - appreciate the support.
