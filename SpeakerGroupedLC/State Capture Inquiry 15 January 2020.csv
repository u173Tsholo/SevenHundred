Pastor J.J,@Elvis Malakoane I am right here bro. Not sure why you didnt see my messages earlier We have very few respectable and honest Policemen left. What a shame. Who is suspicious and who is suspect. He is implicating a few corrupt fools. Quite a few actually We never stop praying @Elvis Malakoane Otherwise we bring out the Doom spray@Elvis Malakoane Long since we had the Bots and Cockroaches @redriger Are u quiet today or is it just me? Where is Danie tpday? Bianca Arnold also seems to be MIA today. Blessings Salmaan I did and Pray you did too @Salmaan Abrahams . May this year be a blessed year for you and your family It is guaranteed that we will have major arrests this year @Salmaan Abrahams Not a chance. Why should I @Frans Hanoshike He will actually say that just after he dies@Bianca Arnold @Bonang Sithole ....Yoh. Nad the poor continue to suffer and die. What a shame Blessings @Jacqui Baumgardt . How are you doing my friend "Blessings to you If we convert Parliamnet and Govt buildings into Prisons we may have a quick solution to all our current problems. The Politicians are already Gangsters and Crooks moulded into one @redriger @redriger We have created one already. Pollsmoor. Pretori Central. Suncity etc. We just need to get the transfer letters sorted out. Are we brave enough to Invest in anything whilst the ANC oversees Investments. Can we trust them with something as big and expensive as another Power Plant? @abinetoshumba .....Absolutely on point. well said

George,it just show you how deep state capture was. nothing will happen to them. this beginning to look like a big sham why has nobody been charde with anything yet? if they want to charge everybody at ones (witch will be almost impossible)there will be to many push back and the trail will take forever. ex scorpion investigator do your people think Zuma will testify.? i think this illness of him are a smoke screen to avoid jail he going for terminal illness to avoid jail time. when will it get independence? ? 2024 are to late at that time there be nothing left. "the problem are they will fight it tooth and nail there's a hotel in Cape town already doing it sea water to tap water. i think the best place to put solar power are in the desert at upinton "The ANC want a Communist state  Upiton are 1 of the hottest places we have in SA 38 degrees "i think nuclear are to unstable prissily why waste it if you can get power from it? his thinking? No the problem are skin color must not be a criteria for any think that's our biggest problem in SA "
