Sindiswa Moolman,I am certain that this witness will boost my confidence in this inquiry after a disappointing two days testimony from the previous one. Yaaa neh... @Thiza William We are now about to start. "We are all confused here
Thiza William,note its still early more than 30 witness are lined up. So one or two should not spell doom. Possible Former Minister Mbalula will take podium this afternoon so as Pull a Williams "Others on the are current and former ministers
Queen K,Sello woman again 😩😩 Yawn 😩😩
Jackson Mpala,Mental case is such a drama queen. State capture is fake why only the Boers are so excited at Mentors fake testimonies Already she is contradicting herself She thought it was going to end o facebook. On facebook she is a sensation and big celebrate amongest the boers because the goal is to weaken the ANC and strengthen the DA The boers gave her large sums of money to lie about the state DA dometsic workers and gardeners are braiwashed to defend their masters This makes me questio the intelligece of Madonsela Now she claim eye sight but she is ever chatting on facebook "Mentor is a talkative woman I am shocked Zondo removes glasses to see clearly Where we stand is Mentor lied to the nation and must be jailed But they are now wasting our time with their confusion "please no Zulu here I missed it what did you say "Millicent "I agree justice for Zuma Its law language
noko yamebetlwa,my lady Mentor I was ur body guard last night you r welcome Mr Venter
PETER STAFFEN,Jackson Mpala idiots like you should actually keep your thoughts to yourself as you are brain dead Jackson Mpala because we see the truth and not lies that your people tell under oath Jackson Mpala prove it idiot "Jackson Mpala you have no intelligence 
Peet Venter,Thank you for your service Noko.
Mlungisi Mbanjwa,Kazi yozala nkomonina "Usis’Mentoor lo ubetha abanqandelwayo "@ganasan "This ganasan has something psychologically wrong
david jacobs,Morning All getting interesting hey I dont think Mentoor is lying Stealing is stealing a spade needs to be called a spade @Bobstaa Mtimande True @Sofia Sofia didnt you hear yesterday she mention she was told to remove Zuma 's Name @Marvel Ramatshela Agreed She's not the only witness still more to follow im waiting on the 2nd witness for today that interacted directly with Zuma Gwede with no Struggle credentials and joined ANC 1992 -like Malema says @Stephen Cohen me too yip The whole Zuma faction is involved
J Ganasan,when are Gupta and Zuma taking the stand "fat lady needs a few years in jail Le Roux - the ANC is the African National Corruption party led by Cyril who made millions from government contracts thando - looks like she eats a trucklaod of curry every day Mandela's legacy - a party and government that is corrupt thru n thru. He must be turning over in his grave "fat people are a blight on society. Lazy body Lorna - agree 100%. ANC has destroyed your lovely country @Marvel - ok I withdraw my statements about obese people. Their choice to be fat. My apologies why is it unfair. pls enlighten me waste of taxpayers money. just jail the bastards zuma and gupta's and seize all their assets "the chair could do with a weight loss program too. all these government fat cats living off the taxpayer the chair sounds like he's a bit slow witted Zondo the clown - ANC cronie - how did he ever get the job "Sheridan - Mentor lied and is trying to bullshit her way out of it. Zondo is clearly out of depth Yes I did apologize 😞 Peter - who is Steihoff? wonder how much gupta paid for that ring on Mentor's finger. Its huge the 1665 areall public servants. Private sector employees have to work for a living Mentor has Alzheimers - she can't remember much they should offer this cow amnesty in return for evidence against zuma and other big fish don't u just hate it when posters speak greek or french they off to the pub for lunch? Bet Mentor orders 5 main courses. The poor girl must be famished c'mon man - gives us a song this guy is too cute - he seems genuinely upset for Mentor Mentor has selective amnesia
Teddy Ntsente,Lol @Jackson Mpala CONFUSION Galore!!!
Jean-Pierre Le Roux,they all lie "this is a smokescreen I see all these hearings and enquiries but no prosecutions. It's just a massive waste of time and money and to fool the ppl to think we dont like corruption JZ and his son will do well in jail @Thabo Kganyago I think at least 52million ppl in SA think that most Zumas and Mandela's son must be in jail "eyesight??????why must she read why are there no white ppl implicated in this state capture? or are there?
Sofia Sofia,Hi ALL Do they not fear their lives ? So even if she is lying she is BRAVE! What a BEAUTIFUL land we have eaten and destroyed by dirty Scavengers with their dirty paws! besides that we walk on eggshells on what we say how we say it everything is taken in the wrong context. Who's the next witness ? or is Mentor on the entire day ? CONFUSED...... What does Parliament’s withdrawal of the Expropriation Bill mean? I think Miss Mentor thinks she's got this one ..... ! IN THE BAG ! 😃 Not her signature .... None of the signatures are hers no commission of Oath stamp LOL we need torture method in these cases to get the truth out .... or a truth Serum .... Is she witness against Zuma and Gupta or just Gupta ? Who told her ?@Bobstaa Mtimande @david jacobs yes I did hear But did she do that ? Let me go read my LIES so I can give you the TRUTH ...
Nqobizitha Khumalo,Why did she need to consult for her to maintain her statement if she telling the truth Ganasan apologized nje Justice 🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 "She is the only one who is right and everyone else who submitted their affidavits is lying. Mr Mtolo

OneStop Medical,"Why would she lie
Millicent Shozi,@le roux dont be so quick 2make that judge @ Ganasan last time i checked your girlfriend was fat @le roux bye man and stop waisting our time if these people can just call malema to sort out this whole thing will take him only one day who wouldnt be nervouse on this spot? @le roux you racist you stole our land yes rot in jail "really admire this chair @lorna who are those people? just wana be sure did this lady ever jole with msholozi fat like you Ganasan @ Louw join the revolutionary movement than you will know where you stand "hai uyawgaya umuthi msholozi how do you speak to a document @paul life time lesson at the end of the day you alone to answer to your acts and omisions @marver? 😂 @sofia whatever theresa whispered to the president favoured the colonist as usual hi naaz yes that what she means what wrong with that luxolo when will we see duduzane @production😂 proper sangoma i rus a beauty spar thing the leading lawyer must pay me a visit J out of 365 days how many days can you remember. i meet over thousand people a year more than half of them i dont remember

TSHIAMO SEIPELO,Our Country is about to be removed on some People 's hand. is interesting.
Lindarose Mazibuko,they belong in jail
Marvel Ramatshela,"To my perspective @Ganasan - May I kindly suggest that you withdraw your view about full bodied people. I don't think it's Ayoba my guy. "This chat was flowing precisely until people such as Ganasan started body shaming other people. it's just not fair. let's try to be accomodative "Something went wrong with her affidavits "let's be patient "Jacob Zuma is 76 years now "The NPA will start persecuting in 2024 he'll probably appeal 3 times until he turns 90. I'll leave it to you to guess what will happen. Guptas were having our country's fiscus right in their hands. They did all they want. Now we are suffering with 15% Vat and 16.03 per liter while they eat samoosas in Dubai.😥😥😥 Duduzane should be coming in the next 2 weeks. That's the person who actual sold our country to those fools @Nomthandazo - You welcome (No tanganedzwa in TshiVenda) "We need Profile Pics guys "1.665 people watching today SARS inquiry today has only 85 viewers watching.

Some are just comrades who.were cooking ""Phuthu"" and Masi in the bush. Then became MPs in 1994 as a reward. They didn't start at Unisa and Fort Hare." @Ganasan- No amnesty this time. We need to send them to jail to send a serious message to the politicians and other servants not to mess with public money
Mkhuseli Freddie,to me this state capture will expose the whole ANC. it is clear that zuma was captured and mentor and company are using that to fight their own battles. "Clearly

Dan Bourne Yeshurun,Fakey is back. day 3 no useful info
Lorna Kavanagh,The anc government should be ashsmed of what they have done to this country. corruption everywhere .... the commission is a serious affair. alot is at stake to get to the truth. Many poor people are suffering because of state capture. white and black people who cannot get work. The cost of living is very high and so are taxes. Fuel is exhorbitant. Eskom electricity is incredibly high. Food ... everything and everybody is affected
