Dams daily motivations Madamalala,Who is these? ndaa! Who is on the stand today? Lets grow South Africa togather do not talk politics while we need service Issue of pension/Profident fund for government employees is a world wide issue do not talk for SA ONLY you must aline yourself with the world Economy Listen to Robert kiyosaki Rich dad on pension fund

makhosi nobhatyi,ANC wins "People has spoken and choose their choice
Conrad Ludik,the sabc is hiding away the elections cuz they are corrupted. why dont the IEC think of electrontcal voting system with finger print scanning? then all the corruption will be to the end. your finger print is with your ID so then there will not be any curruption
charles venter,I agree And the people vote the ANC in again I just say we will see when we all lose our pension and provident money to the government who will vote anc
Sofia Sofia,Hi All I think the ANC today is not the ANC of the Zuma Era ... Lets give CR a chance .. I was really not wanting them to win BUT Lets hope CR reshuffles all the pro Zumas out after he wins ANC for National and DA for Provincial
Nkosi Taylor,commission of inquiry Ramaphosa is our president Kyoze kubuye uJesu
Francesco Paulucci,Phambili with arrests Cyril phambili!!! Nda Who says... Well we can wait and see You dont know for sure

Mphumuzi Maduna,for ever aibo we love him
Vukile Maki,Smaller Parties are chance takers let them not being bad losers.
Fred M,he will get thrown under the bus like Mbeki all these inquiries will come to nothing it will be swept under the carpet. it's all smoke and mirrors. after them come the people
Mzalwane Mzala,The ANC takes Eastern Cape with 69%. "With 91% of stations declared SARS is investigating tax related claims that were made in this commission. "To all those who were saying their parties will be running the country after these elections: I hope you know that you need 50% +1 to run a country The DA' stated intention of taking the Norther Cape from the ANC has failed as with 97.7% of stations declared the ANC has won with 57.3% compared to the DA's 25.8% Is it safe to assume that @Sipho Owen Ndhlovu did not vote? So much anger against people who chose to exercise their democratic right. I read some comments here and you get the feeling that people would have loved to decide for others. Is Alfred Nzonza not a South African? Where are you from @alfred nzonza ? Did you vote @alfred nzonza? I am done with you @alfred nzonza I see that in all the provinces the ANC has scored more on the national ballot by about 2 or 3% compared to the provincial ballot. What is the meaning of this?
Lerato Rapudi,small parties may be annoying but have valid points some of us we did experience free voting but fair I don't think so because indeed many people walked in and the voting station closed at 8:25
Denise Lakey,state capture is here to stay unless the New Dawn loses the Zuma shackles

Born free,All African leaders must get rid of corruption in order to be respected and improve the economy and lives of the people but I fear this will not change. African leaders are self serving The new South Africa is 25 years old. All citizens must ensure they stand united against corruption and racism. Can someone please tell me if there should have been two ballot boxes when voting.. one for Provincial and another for National? Yes Alfred it was the African tribal chiefs that captured their Africans and sold them to Slaves Traders. Did you folk have two ballot boxes when you voted? "Service delivery When I voted there was only one ballot box is this normal? Yes 5 years ago there was two but not this time.. do you think it is fishy? how do I get hold of the IEC? A friend of mine said that she voted in Hartismith and there was only one ballot box she found this unusual. Plenty of blacks have left Africa to go and live in the pink faces countries.. why do you think that is? well the colonialists could have done as Hitler did to the Jews.. which I condemn I am not an Afrikaaner nor was I part of any Apartheid. I was living in Botswana during those years. You can't change African mentality they will always vote for the liberators who are corrupt. "How ridiculous your liberators are Zuma Civilization began in Africa therefore Africa belongs to all mankind. we will see how banks deal with that. "Same can be said about blacks in Europe and America and Australia
Magda Seguin,"Blind faith in a party that betrayed the nation is astounding Counting on CR to change the status quo with a magic wand is like believing in fairy stories.The looters are still in control. "Mr Volmink has exceptional institutional knowledge.What a great report.The gross fraud Maybe it's better not to debate with some who are state capture denialists.Sad that people can't see that SA is virtually bankrupt and that Zuma sold the soul of the country by stealing the fiscus and Taxpayers money was looted!! Hatred will not give your arguments credibility @Sybil Stephens History? you don't know me..stop being insulting @Sybil Stephens...do you hate yourself so much? Its showing "Anger saps energy @Hasan x what about Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen civilians and children and executing 37 people last week for minor transgressions. "Your IQ needs resetting @Sybil Stephen's "Hatred is the major cause of human misery and destruction of the planet @MIKE LOCK I get so tired of people spreading hate and division I will leave the haters to argue amongst themselves...they are having a field day.They thrive on self hate. Land was stolen from the Khoisan by those who migrated from the Great Lakes region in Africa.That is the REAL history "The EFF and BLF indoctrinated and poisoned peoples minds

E RUT,@Thando Nkutha So if Africa wants to be at table - OAU MUST form economic block. Thando Nkutha . No question. Just stating fact. If Africa wants to progress - we better unify. I think a model which sets rules of coperation economically. A "@Thando Nkutha "@Thando Nkutha So I am saying route sorry @Thando Nkutha we are too small sir. Look up our share of world population as a continent vs economic share. You cant think present tense if you want to thrive in 20 to 50 years @Thando Nkutha Read a bit of sociology. It is almost and evolutionary thing that humans progressed to commune in larger and larger groups. From small family groupings killing each other for food to @Thando Nkutha 195 nations states in the world right now. then the 195 states have groups themselves into economic blocks. Except Africa. Have we not evolved ? or have we done so at a slower rate due to impact of colonisation ? when do we start thinking @Thando Nkutha Also consider nationalism and fragmented globe (forget continent) in era of WMD and climate change and global conflict @Thando Nkutha Really. Right now you cant negatiate with Germany. You do so with the EU. But they deal with SA as standalone. Just bow and take whats coming! Dont forget security co-op. NATO especiall As much as Mbeki was aloof and cold. he drove this agenda. But also did so because he had less and less credibility to address local issues and occupied his time on Africa and global issues @Thando Nkutha SA debt levels cant increase - we already teetering full on junk status. Co's local and foreign are not investing. We not growing. Unemployment is ball "balooning. we have to grow to first absorp labour @Thando Nkutha Agree we have had poor leadership. Quite honestly it ended with Mandela - althoug his focus was reconciliation mainly. Economy was left to Mbeki - from term 1 already. @Thando Nkutha Maybe you should spend time and analyse the numbers and the political speak. not "@Thando Nkutha As much as we criticise the USA @Thando Nkutha Mandela recon project shud not be underestimated. He ensured that this place didnt end up in a blood bath. Numerous examples worldwide of potential more likely ways SA cud have gone @Thando Nkutha Yes he didnt focus on the detail. Thabo ran that really for 3 terms !!!!! @Thando Nkutha Yes FACT. So do we cry or think ? @Thando Nkutha. Maybe read a bit. Start by looking at big picture then work down to detail level. We need plan to become wining nation. We have gone backwards @Thando Nkutha Start with size of world economy (analyse by how the have made alliances) and then compare to world by population size. Then sit quiet and THINK. How do we box smart @Thando Nkutha Dont worry if you only 25 "@Thando Nkutha. But difficult if you are a featherweight going against the heavies. Even if you hit "@Letlhogonolo Rakola Once we start acknowledging history and accept reality
ntu,How do Africans Unify there land? @Thando Nkutha yes with exceptions "more of same with anc china is not our friend!!! you cannot ally with them!!! its clear that the kracka pink face creators give clear examples of Conism. "pardon me Population Control!!! what happen next is we see pink face people begging on the corner with tin cup @Danie Nilsen i'm agreeing with your statement they only want minerals "Food in West what do these people have to offer from china to the west and eu?? Mass Produced food at the end of the day all they have to offer is Diseases You give them mineral wealth they gave you H.I.V. now they give them EBOLA where is the golden stool? and Europe a cancerous place
Norman Zwane,"Congratulations to all those who supported or voted ANC as it seems their party has all but won the election. Personally I am certain there are many other parties that will point out their own success in these elections. I congratulate those too. All I can say I a feel privileged to have cast my vote freely and no fear "Anyone interested in 'talking' business with a potential BEE partner? If you 'buy' into the general concept of BEE @E RUT Just enjoyed following your exchanges with @Thando Nkutha. If you don't mind my jumping in: My personal disappointment was to see how our white counterpart simply sulked for loss of privilege @MIKE LOCK In my mind I am visualising such a relationship. The partner would finance their investment. The cash injection would be ring-fenced to enhance the partnership than be a buy out.
