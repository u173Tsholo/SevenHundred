Mantwa Maluleka,:dothefive: he was full of energy yesterday he is stammering is it fear liar liar Jim Carey
Victor,What more could he have done? @Ntsikelelo Mgxigxwà morning morning Maybe he wants to say disrespectful instead of insubordination Did the witness do anything in his own capacity as CA? "@vuvu licious I agree totally @Salty Crack Not really... he stands with his truth It wasnt high on a different locomotive @Akhonamandla Gala yes mr Myburgh has his view and doesnt want to understand Amla I'm still liking Amla mr Myburgh is becoming bossy mr Myburgh is dwelling on same point His problem was to compromise on what he believed in maybe he didnt know of the bad faith mr Singh was speaking with mr Myburgh has no other point against Amla... he is dwelling on same point @mmbudzeni mapholi Yes its important but u cant ask in the same manner Amlsa did all he could ... he failed in compromising in the principles of negotiating @Blake Yogi Thats another factor that plays in one's mind how many people have gone to the extend of losing their job in defence of a company? @Teunis van Ree Has anyone you know defended a company on the risk of losing their job? I like Alma's character... he doesnt get angry easily by now I would have answered roughly to mr Myburg @zip reeper hehehehehe I'm still behind Amla... I will need alot of convincement to be against him @cassim suleman I dont think so as yet @Blake Yogi but that what he has been saying over and over Singh explained about final product and not how you got there @Blake Yogi Yes I'm anxiously waiting @Blake Yogi hehehehe... Yesssss... Alma 6 he has just hit a boundary mr Myburgh has run out of arguments Amla has hit another 6 @Brian Amla is hitting 6s mr Myburgh is now scratching around Myburgh is trying to nail a wrong individual yes to a wrong qn mr Myburgh hehehehehe @Deon Visser mr Myburgh may argue on other points not CA principles @Kopano Mnguni yes Myburgh is scratching around for points... hehehehehe mr Myburgh is arguing semantics and not points @Louis C the witness is not worried about being right...he is standing with his principles of being honest @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee I have been here since the start... but they have to nail the right people not Amla @ALTA he rather bossy than hot... he has not points but arguing semantics The best that Amla woud have done was not to compromise his CA principles and risk losing his job @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee apologies... I will reseve my comments @Akhonamandla Gala I feel the same... @Naledi Barron I personally dont like personal fights thats why the apology Thanks @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee
nkosingiphile ndlovu,"Myburgh has done his homework 🤔 😳😳😳 Myburgh!!! "@Durr What fear Mr Laher?🤨 "The witness will need aircon today 🤫 His profession is on the line today 💔🤫.

vhutshilo mugudu,advocate u are on the right track press him amla today is not confident small fear im sure he got treat during the night where you surprise? u remember my question 20l of water u are not taking 50 rand here answer my question
Siyabonga Kubheka,This witness is now very economical with the truth. This witness is now cracking... This guy was a beneficiary to corruption. He ate the forbidden fruit. Myburgh = Nkalakatha
Diana Sekatane,corruption really spoils people's livelihood. it's such a shame. "It's not nice working with crooks kuzoba lit today... answer my question. Adv. Myburg has this one in his bag. don't get ahead of yourself. When working with vultures you need to cover all your tracks. he was sleeping on the wheel. "If you don't want to lose your job why was he hand picked? the reason that he chosen was to further the capture of the soe. he is an accomplice. "what does the ANC think about all this corruption unde their watch @Pheladi that is really unfortunate. this adv. is like adv. Maleka.
Abongile Xhantini,You're not just a calculator?🤣🤣🤣🤣 You're not answering my question! Kwaaaak! I like this advocate He said he doesn't know what insubordination is? "Mr Laher Maybe I should have been insurbordinate 🤣🤣🤣 Ku berd today!
Ozwell Jonas,things are now getting hot there was a little fear at the back of my head he is breathing hot air now
Joshua Borias,""" THIS ADVOCATE IS CLINICAL """ ADVOVO IS AN AVALANCHE 4 DE WITNESS """

Luzuko Mgotywa,my man so e as early but you already on fire 😂😂😱
mazet,insubordination
Cruda Bex,GM all ALTA where is Naledi Barron? Yes Naledi is back😁😁 welcome back. Hawks are watching Amla Hawks are behind the bats man waiting yo catch the ball Myburgh is bawling the last over Corruption is dangerous it kills educated and uneducated equally. I will never say South Africa is poor again.
Romulus O'Brien,Clearly the advocate has not been in one of theses rooms. You do not question your senior's judgment. You toe the line. "The bowler is throwing Alma will carry his bat today. He is 101 not out. Watch... he is still at the wicket. Myburg is tampering with the ball. Alma is standing outside the crease ready for the next illigal delivery. Myburg does not seem to like the reverse sweep Alma is exercising on his aggressive deliveries. Score 120 not out.... Myburg lost for words. Did not expect to be hit out the ground. Wicket keeper needs to chirp him... Was not his place to put his foot down. Will Myburg be brave enough. to ask Mr. Singh why he inflated the figures in the first place. I don't think he has the guts to do so. He is a defensive 1player. Will still be there after tea. Laher does not need a beer or a logo to play this game. He is a talented batsman..
Queen K,morning all. Gm Elvis and Thando. the witnesses not very confident like yesterday. lady Naledi welcome back. morning Annie He lied thinking he will confuse the commission with numbers 😢 He is nailed... drink baba Myburg did his homework the whole night😄 "im well thando Zinhle snitching on Valencia. 😂 Bianca where are you? "evidence leader and DCJ were quite yesterday while he lied Zalisile Ndzala hey girl. "body language says he is lying today he looks so stupid indeed lies makes one looks stupid with all the qualifications. he should have been truthful from the beginning. "i do Rohan i feel sorry for mr Amla. Naledi my lady!
mrp,he has slowed his run rate today. LOL hindsight lol he's delinquent! LOL his lying is so obvious lol crooked as a cork screw LOL lol lol zip reeper forsure send him a bouncer
Christy,The Hashim Amla I know wouldn't have done this. This 2020 is Hawks' year! They are making the pots to be done! "Laher "Everything is under investigation in this country "Laher Smartwatch is like "" Rest Bafethu! Rest!""" Rest Bafethu! Rest!
Akhonamandla Gala,but you can't force an advise to your boss Myburgh is bowling no balls and wides to Hashim Amla so can't he say he was not appointed? Water!! haha Mr Myburgh Myburgh doesn't understand Amla even at Lord's cricket grounds the English couldn't touch Amla. now Myburgh is coming up with theories "They explained to him why they decided the final price he was not in the second negotiations it was raised and they didn't listen to him Mr Myburgh haibo chief Zondo also doesn't understand Amla "Amla is now done with spin bowling Myburgh please give up chief "Mr Sighn was also a CA and his senior "Amlas evidence is rock solid so far @Thulani Bukani what was he supposed to do if his views were not taken by his seniors. was he suppose to force them? "The business case was done in Yen at the end of the day doing the business case in Yen was not his decision but his seniors @Zip reeper 😂 Myburgh engakhaliyo iyayekwa @Sarel Klopper 😂 "If he feels like protecting them by holding the truth the commission will have nothing against him "@Kagiso Mathole how is his job on the line tjooo advanced payments lol @Big Daddy bathi ungu Papa Action walapha kule Live Chat 😂 lol "Amla is continuing with his batting well played Hashim

Thando Mgodeli,GM everyone 🙏.
Louis C,This guy never closed an eye last night! @Abongile Xhantini 😅😅😅 @vuvu licious Your comment makes no sense...? He's now droebek Myburgh bowling at 145 kph "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee Why so insulting @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee Thank you! Dressed by Khaliques @Victor If the witness is innocent. he has nothing to worry about
Fred Desrosiers,He still has a fear. Something is going to come out. what it is that he feared? I think they do not understand the fear/bullying that can be put on employees by top management. "He was a ""tool"". Many employees work that way. let management roll over him." he thinks he is too smart for the advocate "Transnet is in trouble. Unless they get accountants that will be harder on the numbers Using his Way Forward or Backwards is a way to falsely justify the 44 number thatvwas given. not making the difference in rate calculation to a more stable currency was a deriluction of his accountant duty. In 2014 Yen to USD was fluctuating by more than 20%. One could bankrupt a company with that kind of fluctuation "@SanFran Arnold today he is evading. Yesterday he acted like Superman. Kryptonite found? Someone was greased by the 15 times increase. the truth of this will come out.

Carl Jules,Watching from US I love South African politics @FieliesSA I watch everyday. SOAs are very eventful to say the least. I heard South Africa lost 100 Billion in corruption under Zuma As a black man in United States I can honestly say South African outdue US citizens when it comes to politics. SA has the most progressive democracy and the youth are very intellectual. @Tommygun No i dont think so. South Africa received independence for better or less in 1990s. Not one civil war. No dictatorship. Succession of power and a youth that is very enlightened As long as South Africans are able to distribute the wealth to the indigenous blacks then everything should be fine. @Canis Africanis United States has school massacres like its candy. We cant go anywhere without fearing for our lives. We had a shooting where 50 people got killed at a concert. @FieliesSA Yes and it is very horrible. You have to think as well SA is a very young democracy. All kinds of cultures and tribes. Its just about finding the right balance. Use the system to your adva

Alonzo Trier,They have him by his logic
Sandile Mkhonto,The Lawyer is being unfair though. Remember he raised his concerns and he assumed that Singh was acting in the best of Eskom. @Akhonamandla Gala that my point. They are being unfair. even them they respect Chair during the proceedings. They dont challenge him. @Zuko Nodada in the ideal world you can challenge your seniors but we all know that is not happening To be a CA is a sin sometimes. you are held at high standards
