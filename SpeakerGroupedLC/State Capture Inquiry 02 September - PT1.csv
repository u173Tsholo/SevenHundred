Phillip Cwazibe,"@Tee Makara ​Who’s this guy? Mr. Sandile Nxasana @TG Swartlane ​Mxolisi not Sandile: He is Mxolisi Sandile Oliver Nxasana @makhosi nobhatyi : It is said that the rumor spread was that Mr. Nxasana would prosecute the former state president. @ Gee Peex1 ​I was very disappointed with Advocate Kate Hofmeyr on Friday....what did she do? I think she was clear and articulate. @Gee Peex1 ​@Danie Nilsen : She is the evidence leader and I think she must seek clarity and understanding with the witnesses. @Danie Nilsen Agreed with that. @ Danie Nilsen ​ Over site committees should not be constituted on the basis of majority but equal representation of all political parties. "@ Anne M. ​@Phillip Cwazibe Traditionally
TG Swartlane,Mxolisi not Sandile
jasper dougal,Mr Pretorious is not the bet Evidence Leader here and yet he gets to question the most serious people of interest "Zondo not the best Judge either  Going back over evidence already given
eva tiana,why all this
Kevin Simon,jasper dougal ​Going back over evidence already given. There's nothing wrong with making sure of the facts. Probably a pivot point in this matter. Mbuso Ndlovu ​Is Zondo not corrupt????. Do you have reasons for your suspicion? Here we go. We must amend the Constitution. Parliamentarians should be elected NOT nominated by the crooks who won the election.
Mbuso Ndlovu,Is Zondo not corrupt???? I had that some of the Judges are captuerd Gavin Watson faked his death Zuma was scared of prosecution The money is already finished Taxpayers What the point of having points
Slindile Ngcobo,@jasper dougal ....this is not a court case...it is a commission.
stanley mashaba,jst joint 🤔🤔
vincent kganyago,Zondo can actually see he doesn't need this glasses
makhosi nobhatyi,Why former President wanted Nxasana to be guilty whereas courts acquitted him not guilty no squabble I don’t understand but himself sitting with there with lot of allegations on corruption and fraud Former state president used those rumors very funny coz president had no basis to fire mr Nxasana he was desperate to find something to linked mr Nxasana guilty @ Phillip Cwazibe After this session @ Maxwell Sibiya President feels unsafe when mr Nxasana wanted to prosecute his own people who are protected Gangster state led by gangmaster mr Zuma Zuma destroys people career Tjooo because he was looking for favors if he doesn’t control you anymore then you will be axed by midnight "@ Bev Daniel I don’t have doubts about Ace Magashule He is a master @ Diwi the Doer Constitutional courts findings was in correct decisions @ Nelson Musoliwa DCJ is careful to comment on the findings but there loopholes in judgement so he will come back with findings on later stage @ Gee Peex1 yes for me that Judgement was not decided on bringing back coz he never vacate office by himself he was persuaded by the president to vacate office He was trying to buy you sir Zuma Attoneys and minister D. Mahlobo We will listen those telephone conversation right here see who lies Commission will go to investigate those conversations recording and we will hear who lied here because DCJ is looking for facts "We not just satisfy by one individual who tell us stories ANC must stop defending individuals who are accused of corruption and leave there without investing this to protect integrity of the party look here Anc is absent here @ Singi Mathebula you correct I still believe there are those who still have consciousness to lead clean government but cowards to speak out coz they will subjected as if they embarrassed party @ Danie Nilsen DCJ have sympathy for this man They must pay him back that R10 mil @ Gee Peex1 it is sad poor man never wanted to vacate his office he was forced to do so "It is so said seeing foreign shops looting Report when they done wrong n
Born free,Watson was due to answer Tax evasion questions at the commission the day after his alleged suicide. Zuma The enabler of corruption To give evidence What is going on with the tie of Adv Pretorius ? 🤣 must be the stripes Pressure from Jiba and Mwrebi No exoneration for the corrupt ANC JZ was never capable of written correspondence he does not have that level of intelligence. "This witness has already said he told Zuma ""if you want me to to resign you must pay me up till the end of my contract""" Wrong JZ just has smart lawyers.. Yes The dumbest Zondo has a voice like Barry White if he sang his words would be faster 🤣 It's just that Zondo has a very deep voice. Nothing wrong with Zondo. Exactly how long was this witness head of NPD? It sounds like this man was not employed for longer than 6 months Surely a contract of 10 years has other legal contractual terms referring to termination of employment. He did nothing wrong he was forced to leave because he was doing everything RIGHT. He was not corruptible He did not breach his contract it was Zuma and Jiba and Mrwebi Iam glad he spent the money

Makwa Choma,Why people blame Zuma only n not his party We are exonorating the Anc "The president said in parliament the country resources are depleted Why the media did not help the public with explaining that statement???

Pastor J.J,@Singi Mathebula I expected you to ask the question sooner rather than later. I found the question to be very disrespectful and inappropriate. Well done @Gee Peex1 You dont seem to have the ability to shut up for a few minutes to breathe. You are a very disrespectful and despicable person. Dont force people to communicate or respond to you.

Ntombekaya April,👍
Nelson Musoliwa,Gee Zondo got sharp minds but struggle to coordinates words to put matters into a clear and simple perspectives ; it take him long time to do so How did Zuma proved that Nxasana asked to be removed from office? IGee i agree with you that is why i said linguistically; in shied to say to coordinate English words; Hnery you r right Zondo is very careful and got sharp minds all i am saying is he struggle to coordinate English words to clear and simplify matters perspectively. Danie there can be a point till i make it clear and simple for you sharp and fast; not so? Dani i think u got it wrong fact is not about agreement but proven truth.
khethiwe Majozi,"You are right Danie
Masakane Dikgole,RZ is applying his mind very well for him not to be misinterpreted free advert for Adv Nxasana's practise
Henry Mayambu,My view is that justice Zondo is very careful when selecting the words to use as judge understands the meaning of words to some extent different from the ordinarily use of some of these words.
